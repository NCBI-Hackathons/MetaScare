Prokaryotic CRISPR Cas systems provide adaptive immunity by integrating portions of invasive nucleic acids spacers between genomic CRISPR repeats Cas6 family proteins help generate spacer derived tags crRNAs that target Cas nucleases to matching invaders We show that a Marinomonas mediterranea Cas6 reverse transcriptase RT Cas1 fusion combines three biochemical activities Cas6 RT and Cas1 that function in both crRNA processing and spacer acquisition from RNA and DNA We report a 2 85 crystal structure of this divergent Cas6 identify its active site by site directed mutagenesis and show that the Cas6 domain but not Cas6 catalytic activity is required for RT activity and spacer acquisition from RNA Further CRISPR repeat RNA binding to Cas6 inhibits the RT suggesting a mechanism for coordinating these activities Phylogenetic analysis reveals multiple independent events resulting in stable association of Cas6 with CRISPR associated RTs perhaps reflecting a more widespread link between pre crRNA processing and RNA spacer acquisition
