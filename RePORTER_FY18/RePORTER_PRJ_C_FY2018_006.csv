Approximately 12% of all Veterans suffer from diabetes mellitus, and after about 20 years with the disease, essentially all have the retinopathy to some degree. Although prolonged good glycemic control has been demonstrated to inhibit the development of diabetic retinopathy in patients, this goal is essentially impossible for most diabetics at present, so additional means are needed to inhibit the development of diabetic complications such as retinopathy. The Kern laboratory has focused on learning how diabetic retinopathy develops and can be inhibited. These studies have been conducted in animals in the past, and have offered appreciable new insight on how the retinopathy develops. These insights have led to discussions to initiate two clinical studies to test new ways to treat and reverse diabetic macular edema and other lesions of diabetic retinopathy.",1880368; ,"KERN, TIMOTHY S;",,10/1/2016,9/30/2021,Acetylation; Adult; Affect; Aldehyde Reductase; Animals; Area; Basic Science; Blindness; Blood Vessels; Canis familiaris; career; clinical care; Clinical Research; Clinical Trials; Complications of Diabetes Mellitus; Development; Diabetes Mellitus; diabetic; diabetic patient; Diabetic Retinopathy; Disease; Epigenetic Process; Extravasation; Eye; Failure; G-Protein-Coupled Receptors; glycemic control; Goals; Inflammation; Inflammatory; inhibitor/antagonist; insight; Investigation; Journals; Laboratories; Learning; Lesion; Leukocytes; light intensity; macular edema; Memory; Metabolic; novel; Patients; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Pharmacology; Photoreceptors; Play; Regulation; Reporting; Research; Retinal; Retinal Diseases; Retinal Photoreceptors; Role; Scientist; Seminal; System; Testing; Translating; Veterans; Vision; Work; ,BLR&D Research Career Scientist Application,3604,RCSR,Research Career Scientist ,,,2,,,,

However, even with improvements in early detection and screening  and treatment, overall PrCa mortality rates for African American men have not  significantly declined when compared with those of other ethnic groups. Thus, it is  extremely important to identify molecular biomarkers and/or genetic profiles that can  address the cancer health disparity in African American men, and possibly inform novel  therapies for high-risk populations.

Indeed, Veterans present a higher incidence of chronic pain than the general population: 50% of Veteran patients suffer from at least one type of chronic pain.

Indeed, there are alarming new findings that show that opiates can increase the long-term pain produced by surgical incision and inflammatory agents.

Nearly 27% of people in the age group of 65 years or older, that falls in the demographics of veteran population, have diabetes with men and women in equal proportions. Diabetic nephropathy is the leading cause of end stage renal disease (ESRD), accounting for 44% new cases each year. Also, diabetes acts as a risk factor for renal cancer, the incidence of which increases from age 30 and peaks at 6th decade.

The experiments proposed aim at elucidating the structural organization of corticogeniculate circuits along with the functional role of corticogeniculate circuits in vision. Optogenetics, an emerging technology, is utilized to identify corticogeniculate neurons and to selectively and reversibly manipulate the activity of corticogeniculate neurons in intact animals. Visual responses of visual thalamic neurons and visual cortical neurons are recorded while corticogeniculate neurons are excited optogenetically in order to identify the physiology, morphology, functional connectivity, and functional contributions of corticogeniculate circuits to visual information processing. Results of this study will provide significant insights into the structure-function relationship of a key sensory pathway and the role of this pathway in sensory perception.

The annual meeting of the Perinatal Research Society (PRS) establishes a forum in which research at the cutting edge of perinatal medicine and developmental biology can be shared by leading investigators in the three disciplines. Each year the PRS YI Program also invites YI's (those trainees who are transitioning to independent careers, such as Postdoctoral Fellows through Junior Faculty) to join these national leaders in the field. As they consciously learn of new developments they also are given the opportunity to formally and informally discuss their own ideas. These combined activities provide a unique learning experience that would likely not be found at any other scientific function. We seek funding to continue to support a lectureship as part of aim 1 but mostly to support YI attendance and participation in the annual meeting of the Perinatal Research Society (PRS).

Hall, NIH, Program Officer, laments the lack of new idea being studied or proposed in cholera vaccine research. This critique does not include my group. We are investigating pediatric cholera vaccines based on a novel LPS epitope that is part of a conjugate vaccine formulation. Our current proposal aims to take advantage of the adjuvant properties of Vc flagellar proteins that bind toll like receptor 5 (TLR5) and induce pro-inflammatory cytokines that enhance antigen presentation. This is often a difficult first step of the immune response non-invasive pathogens like Vc ? how to get the right antigen in, in immunogenic form. Vc flagellins are immunogenic in people and induce protective antibodies in animal. Purified Vc flagella and LPS are additive or synergistic at preventing colonization of the gut because both inhibit motility which is required for Vc access to the epithelium.",1881788; ,"WADE, WILLIAM FRANKLIN;","HALL, ROBERT H",11/21/2016,10/31/2018,5 year old; Acids; Acute; Adaptive Immune System; adaptive immunity; Adjuvant; Adult; Africa; Agonist; Animals; Antibodies; Antibody Response; Antibody Specificity; Antigen Presentation; Antigens; B-Lymphocytes; Bacteria; base; Binding; Binding Proteins; Biological Markers; Biomedical Research; Bovine Serum Albumin; Carrier Proteins; cell motility; Cells; Child; Childhood; Cholera; Cholera Vaccine; Clinic; clinically relevant; comparative efficacy; Conjugate Vaccines; Conjugated Carrier; Consensus; Critiques; cytokine; Data; Defect; design; Development; Diarrhea; Dose; Epidemic; Epithelium; Epitopes; Event; Filament; Flagella; Flagellin; flagellum motility; Funding; gastrointestinal epithelium; Generations; Glare; Goals; Gram-Negative Bacteria; Haiti; Haptens; Health; Human; Immune response; Immunity; Immunize; immunogenic; immunogenicity; Immunoglobulin Class Switching; Immunoglobulin G; Immunoglobulin M; improved; Individual; Infection; Inflammation; Inflammatory; inhibiting antibody; Intranasal Administration; intraperitoneal; Killings; kinetosome; Link; Literature; Location; Memory B-Lymphocyte; mortality; mouse model; Movement; Mucous Membrane; Mus; Neonatal; neonate; Nose; novel; Operon; Oral; Oral Administration; Organ Transplantation; Outcome Measure; pandemic disease; pathogen; Phase I Clinical Trials; Polysaccharides; Positioning Attribute; prevent; programs; Property; protective effect; protective efficacy; Protein Subunits; Proteins; Recombinants; Reporting; Research; response; Serotyping; Services; Small Intestines; Structure of germinal center of lymph node; Subunit Vaccines; Testing; Time; TLR5 gene; Transplantation; United States National Institutes of Health; Vaccination; vaccine development; Vaccine Research; vaccine response; Vaccines; Vibrio cholerae; Virulence; ,Cholera conjugates designed to prevent colonization and induce B cell memory,121782,ZRG1,Special Emphasis Panel ,,,2,125000,74400,199400,
