The cardiovascular impairments associated with repeated binge drinking episodes are unexplored in college-aged students. This study is designed to examine changes in the function and structure of the vasculature (ie. arteries) and mechanisms (oxidative stress) in young adult binge drinkers compared to those who do not drink or drink at moderate levels. Our study will provide clinically important data on how binge drinking contributes to premature cardiovascular and cerebrovascular risk in youth.,6913641; 1870293 (contact); ,"PHILLIPS, SHANE A; PIANO, MARIANN R (contact);","OROSZ, ANDRAS",3/1/2017,2/28/2019,Acetylcholine; Address; Adrenergic Agents; Adult; Affect; Age; aged; Alcohol abuse; Alcohol consumption; alcohol measurement; Alcohols; American; Area; arterial stiffness; Arteries; arteriole; Atherosclerosis; binge drinker; binge drinking; Biological Models; Biopsy; Blood; Blood Circulation; Blood Pressure; Blood Vessels; body system; Cardiovascular Diseases; cardiovascular risk factor; Cardiovascular system; Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.); Central Artery; cerebrovascular; Clinical; college; Consumption; Cross-Sectional Studies; Data; design; drinking; Endothelium; Ethanol; Event; Exercise; Female; Funding Opportunities; Future; Generations; Goals; Grant; Health; Healthcare; Hour; Human; Hypertension; Impairment; Inflammation; Injury; injury and repair; insight; Intervention; longitudinal design; male; Measures; Mediating; men; Microcirculation; Microvascular Dysfunction; Molecular; National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism; Nitric Oxide; Nitroglycerin; Norepinephrine; Oxidative Stress; Pathogenesis; Physiologic pulse; Population; Predisposition; premature; pressure; programs; Public Health; Recording of previous events; Reporting; Research; Resistance; response; Rest; Risk; Risk Marker; screening; stroke; Structure; Students; Tissues; university student; Vascular Diseases; Vasodilation; Woman; young adult; Youth; ,Cardiovascular risk associated with binge drinking in young adults,24535,AA,National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism Initial Review Group ,,A1,1,143750,86106,229856,

Although the precise molecular mechanisms underlying these events remain unclear, the observation that many epigenetic regulators, including the DNA (hydroxy)methyltransferases, histone lysine methyltransferases and demethylases are targets of somatic mutations and/or are misexpressed in human cancers suggests that epigenetic dysregulation is not simply a characteristic of cancer cells, but may play a more direct role (as 'driver gene' mutations) in the development and progression of the disease. Our preliminary data indicate that natural isoflavone compounds (such as genistein and daidzein) and flavone compounds (such as luteolin and baicalein) function as inhibitors of two histone demethylases in vitro and the availability of hundreds of (iso)flavone derivative compounds provides us with the opportunity to discover potential pharmaceutical reagents that could link inhibition of histone methylation with possible mechanism(s) of action of these natural compounds.",1896477; ,"CHENG, XIAODONG ;","PREUSCH, PETER",4/1/2015,3/31/2019,Adult; analog; ARID Domain; Aromatic Compounds; Bacteria; baicalein; base; Binding; Biological; cancer cell; Cells; Characteristics; Chemopreventive Agent; Chromatin; chromatin modification; chromosome mutation; Cleaved cell; Clinical; cofactor; Complex; Crystallization; daidzein; Data; demethylation; design; Development; Dioxygenases; Disease model; Disease Progression; DNA; DNA Methylation; Drosophila genus; Enzymes; Epigenetic Process; epigenetic regulation; epigenome; Event; Exhibits; Family; Family member; FDA approved; Flavones; Flavonoids; Gene Expression; Gene Mutation; gene repression; Genes; Genistein; Genome Stability; Goals; Histone Acetylation; Histone Code; Histone Deacetylase; histone demethylase; Histone H3; histone methylation; histone methyltransferase; Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase; Histones; Human; human disease; Huntington Disease; Huntington gene; improved; In Vitro; in vivo; Individual; inhibitor/antagonist; Isoflavones; Kinetics; Lead; leukemia treatment; Link; Luteolin; Lysine; Malignant neoplasm of prostate; Malignant Neoplasms; Mammalian Cell; Methylation; methylation pattern; Methyltransferase; Modification; Molecular; Mus; mutant; N-terminal; Natural Products; Nature; Neurons; outcome forecast; overexpression; Patients; Peptides; Pharmacologic Substance; Phase II Clinical Trials; PHD Finger; Play; Preclinical Testing; programs; Prostatectomy; Protein Family; Proteins; public health relevance; Reagent; Renal carcinoma; Role; Sampling; small molecule; small molecule inhibitor; Somatic Mutation; Source; soy protein isolate; Structure; therapeutic candidate; Therapeutic Intervention; therapeutic target; Toxic effect; Transcriptional Activation; tumor progression; Validation; X Chromosome; X-Linked Mental Retardation; ,"Histone Lysine deMethylation: Structures, Inhibitions and Mechanisms",114306,MSFC,Macromolecular Structure and Function C Study Section ,,,4,194641,115729,310370,

MAO-B creates oxidation (the opposite of an antioxidant), removes some brain chemicals that support normal mood, and can influence death/survival of brain cells. Using positron emission tomography, we propose to measure MAO-B VT, an index of MAO-B level, in medication free clinical depression (n=31), medication free clinical depression with a history of treatment resistance (n=31), and age matched healthy controls (n=46). If this study identifies a therapeutic target of elevated MAO-B level in key affect regulating regions in MDE, and in treatment resistant MDE, then such results could be advanced towards matching MDE cases of elevated MAO-B level towards MAO-B inhibitor treatments in the clinic. For example, low cost predictors of elevated MAO-B level could then be developed (such as the clinical and RDOC measures proposed and/or additional peripheral biomarkers in future study).

To fill this gap of knowledge, we propose to test the hypothesis that brain overexposure to thyroid hormone during development, which may occur as a result of maternal disease or due to undetected disregulation of the gene that controls such exposure, contributes to the susceptibility to neurodevelopmental disorders in the current individual and also in subsequent generations via mechanisms of inheritance that do not affect the genetic code.",8670018; ,"HERNANDEZ, ARTURO ;","DESMOND, NANCY L",6/26/2012,10/31/2022,Adult; Affect; Alleles; Anxiety; Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder; autism spectrum disorder; Autistic Disorder; Award; base; Behavior; Behavior Disorders; Behavioral; behavioral outcome; Bipolar Disorder; Brain; brain behavior; brain morphology; Brain region; Candidate Disease Gene; circadian pacemaker; Circadian Rhythms; Clinical; Comorbidity; Complex; cost; Data; design; Development; developmental disease/disorder; Developmental Gene; Diagnosis; Disease; dosage; Elderly; Endocrine; Endogenous Factors; Environmental Risk Factor; Epidemiology; Epigenetic Process; epigenome; Etiology; Exposure to; Family; Female; fetal; follow-up; Functional disorder; Gene Expression; Gene Expression Profiling; Generations; Genes; Genetic; Genetic Code; Genetic study; genome wide association study; Goals; Healthcare Systems; Heritability; Hypothalamic structure; imprint; improved; Individual; Inheritance Patterns; Inherited; insight; Knowledge; Lead; Life; Link; male; Mental Depression; Molecular; Monitor; Mothers; mouse model; Mus; neonatal brain; nervous system disorder; Nervous System Physiology; Neuraxis; neurodevelopment; Neurodevelopmental Disorder; Neurologic; Neurons; non-genetic; novel; novel therapeutics; Onset of illness; Pathologic; Pattern; Peripheral; Phenotype; Physical activity; Play; Population; Predisposition; Pregnant Women; Prevalence; Prevention; programs; prospective; Publications; Regulation; Research; Research Personnel; Role; Schizophrenia; Social Behavior; Societies; Structure; Testing; Thyroid Gland; Thyroid Hormones; Tissues; Work; ,Epigenetic Influence on Thyroid Hormone Action in the Brain and on Behavior,96050,GHD,Genetics of Health and Disease Study Section ,,,7,250000,139000,389000,

Inpatient sleep disturbance has been linked to clinically relevant and detrimental outcomes such as delirium and falls; both of which are known risk factors for morbidity, mortality, prolonged hospital stays, and increased healthcare costs. Patient-centered care is critically needed to improve inpatient sleep. Critical to optimizing recovery from illness, sleep should be regularly assessed and routinely addressed as part of the clinical care for every hospitalized patient. As a health information technology intervention, sleep promotion tool kit (SLEEPkit), shows unique advantages to support patient-centered care to improve inpatient sleep. Findings of this project will inform further development and refinement of the SLEEPkit, which aims not only to improve inpatient sleep but also to be well integrated to clinical and patient workflow. Consistent with the AHRQ mission, this will lay the groundwork for making inpatient sleep promotion effective and feasible, which will ultimately change current clinical practice related to patient sleep, hence leading to meaningful improvement in patient health, outcomes, quality of care, and cost.",9970625; ,"YE, LICHUAN ;","AL-SHOWK, SHAFA",9/30/2015,9/29/2018,,A Sleep Promotion Toolkit for Hospitalized Patients,24330,HITR,Healthcare Information Technology Research ,,,2,,,,
