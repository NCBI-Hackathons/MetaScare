Fibroblasts invade the injury zone and through various processes actively impair cardiac function. Converting these fibroblasts into cardiomyocytes would be clinically beneficial, as it will restore the normal function of the heart. We have recently shown that a combination of microRNAs (miR combo) reprogrammed fibroblasts into cardiomyocytes and partially improved cardiac function following injury. In this application we will investigate ways to increase efficiency, cell specificity, and effectiveness of miR combo. To that end, we will study a self-complementary Adeno-associated virus that specifically target fibroblasts, the role of TLR3 in enhancing the efficiency of miR combo, and the mechanism by which miR combo induces reprogramming.

Despite the fact that it has been known since 1857 that CO produces tissue hypoxia by binding avidly to hemoglobin (Hb) and reducing oxygen carrying capacity and producing tissue hypoxia, to this date there is no specific antidotal therapy. Use of 100% normobaric or hyperbaric (3-5 atmospheres) oxygen reduces the elimination half-life from 320 minutes to 74 or 20 minutes, respectively. The practical efficacy of hyperbaric oxygen therapy has been very limited, based on the significant time delay between diagnosis in the field, transportation to a hyperbaric therapy center, and treatment within the 'dive' capsule. Furthermore, the most unstable patients with severe metabolic acidosis, and cardiac and central nervous system dysfunction require mechanical ventilation and intensive care support, not practically delivered in hyperbaric capsules. Even with this advanced therapy, persistent neurological sequelae occurred in 1/4 of subjects.

In gastric cancer, a large fraction of tumors is associated to the oncogenic HGF/MET axis signaling. While targeted MET tyrosine kinase inhibitors and neutralizing antibodies have entered clinical trials, their effectiveness in patients have been very limited, due to poor response rates and failure to meet primary end-point objective and/or to the rapid acquisition of resistance to the drug. As a consequence, gastric cancer patient with MET-dependent tumors continue to suffer high mortality rates because effective MET-targeted therapies remain unavailable.  We propose to develop a novel approach for the treatment of MET-dependent tumors.

While its function in cancer cells is known, its role in the heart, wherein Tip60 is enriched, is unknown. Based on Tip60's integrated functions in cancer cells, the proposed work addresses its possible cardiac roles, which aren't mutually exclusive. First, the investigators are assessing whether Tip60 becomes associated with the tips of chromosomes in heart cells at the time of birth to induce the mechanism by which DNA is repaired, which in turn causes cardiac muscle cells (CMs) to enter their persistent non- proliferative state. Second, because Tip60 is known to induce cell death (apoptosis), the investigators are addressing the possibility that its inactivation during a heart attack inhibits this process, protecting the heart from CM death. Results will advance our understanding of why CMs can't proliferate to repair the damaged heart, and whether drug-induced inactivation of Tip60 can prevent effects of a heart attack.",1866717 (contact); 1962483; ,"AUCHAMPACH, JOHN A (contact); LOUGH, JOHN W;","SCHWARTZ, LISA",12/15/2016,11/30/2020,Acetylesterase; Address; Adult; Alleles; Animal Model; Apoptosis; Apoptotic; base; Birth; blastocyst; cancer cell; Cardiac; Cardiac Myocytes; cardiac regeneration; Cell Aging; Cell Cycle; Cell Cycle Arrest; Cell Cycle Inhibition; Cell Death; Cell Line; Cells; Cessation of life; Chromosomes; DNA; DNA Damage; Embryo; Enterobacteria phage P1 Cre recombinase; Event; Excision; Failure; gain of function; Heart; heart cell; Heart failure; Heart Hypertrophy; Homeostasis; HTATIP gene; Human; Hypoxia; In Vitro; in vivo; Induction of Apoptosis; Ischemia; Italy; knock-down; Laboratories; Length; LoxP-flanked allele; Mediating; Mitotic; Molecular; Molecular Target; mouse model; Mus; Myocardial Infarction; Myocardial Ischemia; Myocardium; Natural regeneration; Neonatal; Organ; Pathway interactions; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Phenotype; prevent; Process; Proliferating; Proteins; Publishing; Recruitment Activity; repaired; Reporting; Research Personnel; response; Role; senescence; Stress; Tamoxifen; telomere; Telomere Capping; Testing; therapeutic target; Time; TP53 gene; Transgenes; Work; ,"Tip60, Ischemic Heart Disease and Regeneration",131788,MIM,Myocardial Ischemia and Metabolism Study Section ,,,2,331842,179194,511036,

The primary goal of this proposal is to understand how the initial exposure to hyperoxia and CPAP affects structure and function of the developing airway even after these interventions are stopped. We are focusing on the novel idea that the mechanical stretch imposed by CPAP on the airway (on top of the forces of breathing by the baby and supplemental oxygen) result in activation of mechanisms that promote airway hypercontractility and excessive growth of airway cells, all resulting in a thicker, more reactive airway while the baby and the lungs are growing.

To my knowledge, I will be the first person to test whether chronic NAc stimulation or inhibition can decrease or increase, respectively, motivation for alcohol and identify alcohol-DREADD responsive gene networks in a relevant genetic animal model of binge drinking.",8494454; ,"OZBURN, ANGELA RENEE;",,10/1/2014,9/30/2019,Acute; adverse outcome; Affect; Alcohol abuse; alcohol abuse therapy; alcohol behavior; Alcohol consumption; alcohol craving; Alcohol dependence; alcohol measurement; alcohol relapse; alcohol research; alcohol reward; alcohol use disorder; Alcohol-Related Disorders; Alcoholism; Alcohols; Animal Genetics; Animal Model; Area; Behavior; Behavioral; binge drinking; Biological; Biological Assay; Blood alcohol level measurement; Brain; Brain region; Candidate Disease Gene; Cells; Chronic; Clinical Trials; Clozapine; Darkness; Data; Deep Brain Stimulation; Dependence; designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs; Diagnosis; differential expression; Disease; disorder later incidence prevention; drinking; drinking behavior; effective therapy; Epigenetic Process; Ethanol; experimental study; Family; Gene Delivery; Gene Expression; Genes; Genetic Transcription; Healthcare Systems; Individual; insight; Intake; Knowledge; Liquid substance; Measures; Mediating; Medical; Mental disorders; Methods; Morphology; Motivation; Mus; Muscarinic Acetylcholine Receptor; neuronal circuitry; Neuronal Plasticity; Neurons; novel; Nucleus Accumbens; Oxides; Pathway Analysis; Pathway interactions; Persons; Pharmacogenetics; Property; Public Health; public health relevance; Published Comment; Relapse; Research; Research Priority; response; Rewards; Signal Transduction; Stress; Substance abuse problem; Testing; Therapeutic; Time; tool; transcription factor; transcriptome; transcriptome sequencing; Viral; ,Pharmacogenetic manipulation of brain regions to reduce alcohol binge drinking,2488,NURA,Neurobiology A ,,,4,,,,

We have published on an innovate method for preconditioning a vaccine site with recall antigens that boost the migration of dendritic cells carrying tumor-specific antigen to the lymph nodes, resulting in increased overall survival of patients with newly diagnosed GBM. Since this publication we have identified the primary driver of this enhanced immunity to be the chemokine CCL3, and we propose to mechanistically examine the role of CCL3 as a novel developmental therapeutic treating brain cancer.  ",3160894; ,"SAMPSON, JOHN H.;","FOUNTAIN, JANE W",12/1/2016,11/30/2021,Adjuvant; Affect; Antigens; Bilateral; Brain; Brain Neoplasms; Cancer Etiology; CCR1 gene; CCR5 gene; CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes; cell motility; Cells; Cervical; Cessation of life; chemokine; childhood cancer mortality; Clinical Trials; cytokine; Cytotoxic T-Lymphocytes; Data; Dendritic Cell Vaccine; Dendritic Cells; Developmental Therapeutics Program; Diphtheria Toxoid; Dose; gamma-Chemokines; Glioblastoma; Glioma; Goals; Human; Immune; immune function; Immunity; Immunotherapy; improved; Individual; individual patient; Inflammation; Inflammatory; Injectable; innovation; Interferon Type II; Intracranial Neoplasms; Laboratories; Ligands; lymph nodes; Malignant - descriptor; Malignant neoplasm of brain; Mediator of activation protein; melanoma; Memory; Methods; migration; Modeling; mouse model; Mus; Nature; Newly Diagnosed; Normal tissue morphology; novel; Patients; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Phase; pre-clinical; preclinical study; preconditioning; Primary Brain Neoplasms; Production; Progression-Free Survivals; Publications; Publishing; receptor; Renal carcinoma; response; Role; Signal Transduction; Site; Small Inducible Cytokine A3; Source; T cell response; T-Lymphocyte; targeted treatment; Tetanus; TNF gene; Toxic effect; trafficking; tumor; Tumor Antigens; tumor growth; Tumor Immunity; Vaccination; vaccine development; vaccine efficacy; Vaccines; Work; young adult; ,CCL3 as a Developmental Therapeutic to Enhance Brain Tumor Therapy,99463,CNBT,Clinical Neuroimmunology and Brain Tumors Study Section ,,,2,196875,116156,313031,

We have found that changes occurring to lungs of patients with IPF are similar to those occurring in response to severe viral infection. We can model these responses in mice using influenza virus to induce lung injury and plan to use this system to understand how injury triggers tissue responses leading to stem cell activation. Completion of this work will provide new insights into cellular and molecular mechanisms of repair in acute lung injury and how persistent activation of these repair pathways might contribute to tissue remodeling in the setting of chronic lung disease.

Despite changes in lifestyle and the availability of multi-drug based therapies, 20-30% of hypertensive patients still have uncontrolled high blood pressure. These resistant patients have what is known as ?neurogenic hypertension?, where continual increases in the activity of brain areas that control the cardiovascular system lead to sustained activation of the sympathetic nerves that ultimately tell blood vessels to constrict and raise blood pressure. Therefore it is critical that new therapies for this disease are uncovered. In this project we aim to determine whether proteins that occur naturally within the brain (angiotensin type-2 receptors; AT2R) can lower blood pressure by stopping the activity of cells in the brainstem (gamma-aminobutyric acid [GABA] neurons) that drive increases in blood pressure and hypertension. We will do this by utilizing state of the art genetic approaches to activate or inhibit these AT2R-GABA neurons, combined with a drug that selectively activates AT2R. Based on our preliminary work we predict that this approach, activating AT2R and stopping GABA neurons from working, will have an immediate impact in developing innovative strategies for the treatment of currently uncontrollable resistant hypertension.",6921109 (contact); 1881870; ,"KRAUSE, ERIC GERALD (contact); SUMNERS, COLIN ;","MARIC-BILKAN, CHRISTINE",12/1/2017,11/30/2021,Acetates; Affect; Agonist; Animal Model; Antihypertensive Agents; Area; Attenuated; Baroreflex; base; Basic Science; Blood; Blood Pressure; blood pressure reduction; blood pressure regulation; Blood Vessels; Brain; Brain Stem; Cardiovascular Diseases; Cardiovascular Physiology; cardiovascular risk factor; Cardiovascular system; Cause of Death; Cell Nucleus; Cells; Deoxycorticosterone; Development; Diabetes Mellitus; Disease; DOCA; Enterobacteria phage P1 Cre recombinase; Etiology; experimental study; GABA Receptor; gamma-Aminobutyric Acid; Gene Transfer; Genetic; genetic approach; Hypertension; improved; In Vitro; in vivo; indexing; innovation; Laboratories; Lead; Life Style; Link; Mediating; Mediation; Messenger RNA; Metabolic syndrome; mouse model; Mus; Nerve; neurogenic hypertension; Neurons; Neurosciences; neurotransmission; Neurotransmitters; novel; novel strategies; novel therapeutic intervention; novel therapeutics; Nucleus solitarius; Obesity; optogenetics; Patients; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Pharmacology; Phenotype; Population; pre-clinical; Pressoreceptors; Proteins; receptor; Receptor Activation; Receptor Gene; Receptor Signaling; recombinase-mediated cassette exchange; Reflex control; Reporter; Reporting; Research; Resistance; Resistant Hypertension; Risk Factors; salt sensitive hypertension; Site; stroke; synthetic enzyme; Testing; Therapeutic; Therapeutic Intervention; therapeutic target; Tissues; Transgenic Mice; Translating; treatment strategy; Type 2 Angiotensin II Receptor; vasoconstriction; Viral; Virus; Work; ,Neurons expressing angiotensin type 2 receptors in the NTS as an access point for cardiovascular control.,136595,HM,Hypertension and Microcirculation Study Section ,,A1,1,380476,199750,580226,

The underlying disease process, atherosclerosis, is driven by fat deposits and inflammation in the wall of blood vessels (arteries) We found five short peptide sequences derived from the main protein in low density lipoprotein (the 'bad' cholesterol) that protects mice from atherosclerosis when given as a vaccine. The proposed research is designed to find out how this protection works: we think the vaccination induces a type of white blood cells called regulatory T cells to make interleukin-10, an anti-inflammatory mediator of the immune system. We also propose to optimize the vaccination. We found that peptides that protect mice from atherosclerosis, but not others, bind very well to a key molecule of the immune system called MHC-II.

If there is a benefit to doing an angiogram and treating with stents or surgery, then clinicians and patients must be made aware of these benefits and put them into practice to prevent bad outcomes like heart attacks and death; if the results show there is no benefit from routine invasive testing, then treatment would begin with only intensive lifestyle change and medication to control symptoms and reduce risk.
