They then either invaginate or undergo an epithelial to mesenchymal transition, undergo reshaping or migration and differentiate into various derivatives ranging from ganglia and sensory organs of the peripheral nervous system to (in the case of neural crest) bone and cartilage of the face, cornea of the eye to pigmentation of the body. About 10% of human birth defects, such as CHARGE or DiGeorge syndromes or Hirschprung's disease, affect early neural crest or placode development. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying these defects are largely unknown. Several cancers also originate from the neural crest including the peripheral nervous system derived neuroblastoma, the most common malignancy of infancy, as well as melanoma, pheocromocytoma and other endocrine tumor types. The proposed experiments promise to illuminate the molecular and cellular processes that result in early formation of neural crest and ectodermal placode cells and their derivatives. The results of this study may inform upon diagnosis, therapeutic intervention and also yield approaches guiding maintenance of neural crest and placodal stem cells for the purpose of repair and regeneration. .",1858016; ,"BRONNER, MARIANNE ;","SCHOLNICK, STEVEN",2/1/2018,1/31/2023,Affect; base; bone; Cartilage; Cell Lineage; Cell physiology; cell type; Cells; Cephalic; Characteristics; CHARGE syndrome; Chick Embryo; Competence; Congenital Abnormality; Cornea; Coupled; Data; Data Set; Defect; Development; Diagnosis; DiGeorge Syndrome; Disease; Dissection; Ear; Ectoderm; Embryo; Endocrine Gland Neoplasms; Enhancers; epithelial to mesenchymal transition; Equilibrium; experimental study; Eye; Face; Fluorescent in Situ Hybridization; Ganglia; Gastrula; Gene Expression; Gene Expression Profiling; Genes; Genetic Transcription; Head; Human; Image; Individual; infancy; Injection of therapeutic agent; Lateral; lens; Maintenance; Malignant Neoplasms; Medial; Mediating; melanoma; migration; Molecular; Molecular Profiling; multipotent cell; Natural regeneration; nerve stem cell; Neural Crest; Neural Crest Cell; neural plate; Neural tube; Neuraxis; Neuroblastoma; Neurons; Neurula; Nose; novel; Organ; Peripheral Nervous System; Pigmentation physiologic function; pluripotency; Population; Protein Analysis; protein expression; public health relevance; relating to nervous system; repaired; Reporter; Resolution; rhodamine dextran; Sensory; Signal Transduction; single molecule; Stem cells; Structure; Techniques; Testing; Textbooks; Therapeutic Intervention; Time; Transcript; transcription factor; transcriptome sequencing; ,Cell lineage and transcriptional analysis of the vertebrate neural plate border,27538,DEV2,Development - 2 Study Section ,,A1,1,237500,154375,391875,

In lung cancer, such tumor-infiltrating DCs (TIDCs) induce immune-suppression. Initial work shows that genetically targeting certain complex sugars (glycans) specifically on DCs may slow lymphatic TIDC traffic and induce maturation of TIDCs, which importantly correlates with carcinoma growth inhibition and an anti-tumor immune profile. While this strategy appears to effectively ?re-program? immunity against the tumor, our understanding of mechanisms and pre-clinical targeting approaches in lung cancer models remains limited. Herein, we employ novel genetic methods and inhibitors to interfere with such glycans in TIDCs, while examining for anti-tumor immunologic shifts in the tumor and DLNs. This study examines novel mechanisms and validates key genetic targets to induce anti-tumor immunity and tumor regression in lung cancer, with an eye to therapeutic translation. !",2168683; ,"FUSTER, MARK M;",,10/1/2017,9/30/2021,Activities of Daily Living; Address; Affect; Anabolism; Antigen Presentation; Antigens; Antisense Oligonucleotides; Area; base; Binding; Cancer Model; Cancer Patient; Carbohydrates; Carcinoma; CCL21 gene; CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes; cell behavior; Cell Communication; Cell Maturation; cell motility; Cell physiology; Cell surface; Cells; chemokine; chemokine receptor; Chest; Clinical; Complex; CX3CL1 gene; CXCL12 gene; cytokine; Cytolysis; Dendrites; Dendritic cell activation; Dendritic Cells; Development; Disease remission; Drug Design; Enzymes; Equilibrium; Eye; Genetic; Goals; Growth; Heparan Sulfate Biosynthesis; Heparitin Sulfate; Human; Immune; immune function; Immune Tolerance; Immunity; Immunologics; Immunophenotyping; Immunosuppressive Agents; Immunotherapy; improved; inhibitor/antagonist; Kinetics; KRAS2 gene; Lead; Lewis Lung Carcinoma; lung Carcinoma; Lung Neoplasms; lymph nodes; Lymphatic; Lymphatic Endothelium; Lymphatic vessel; lymphocyte proliferation; Malignant neoplasm of lung; Malignant Neoplasms; Mediating; Methods; migration; mimetics; Modeling; Molecular; Mus; mutant; Mutation; Natural immunosuppression; Neoplasm Metastasis; neoplastic cell; novel; novel strategies; novel therapeutics; Ovalbumin; Ovum; Pathologic; Pathway interactions; Patients; Phenotype; Polysaccharides; pre-clinical; Preparation; Primary Neoplasm; Production; programs; Property; Proteoglycan; proteoglycan core protein; receptor; Regulatory T-Lymphocyte; response; scaffold; Signal Transduction; small molecule inhibitor; sugar; sulfation; Surface; syndecan; T cell response; T-Lymphocyte; targeted agent; Testing; Therapeutic; trafficking; Transgenic Organisms; Translations; tumor; Tumor Antigens; tumor growth; Tumor Immunity; tumor microenvironment; tumor progression; Unspecified or Sulfate Ion Sulfates; Ursidae Family; Validation; Work; ,Dendritic Cell Proteoglycans and Reprogramming Cancer Immunity,3688,ONCB,Oncology B ,,A1,1,,,,

Bacterial Serine/Threonine (S/T) kinases are both signal transducers, and structurally similar to human kinases. Previous work in our lab demonstrates that inhibition of a Listeria kinase, belonging to a family of Penicillin binding And S/T kinase Associated (PASTA), can sensitize the bacteria to beta-lactam antibiotics, suggesting a novel drug development pathway. Additionally certain kinase inhibitors can be ?tuned? to be selective and avoid inhibiting human kinases. In this proposal we will design, synthesize and test novel kinase inhibitors that are too bulky to bind human kinases, but nevertheless are optimized to inhibit an essential kinase in many pathogens including tuberculosis and surgical infections.

In addition, WHO supports the development of research capacity in low income countries and the set-up of research networks between countries and regions. WHO has described its roles and responsibilities in health research in a strategy document, based on a comprehensive consultation process, and endorsed at the 63rd World Health Assembly (WHA) in 2010. It covers the full spectrum of research, which spans five generic areas of activity: measuring the problem; understanding its cause(s); elaborating solutions; translating the solutions or evidence into policy, practice and products; and evaluating the effectiveness of solutions. In addition WHO's position as a focus for global health R&D has recently been reaffirmed in the draft Resolution arising from a Member State meeting held in November 2012. The draft Resolution, which will be debated at the WHA in May 2013, requests the WHO to establish a global health R&D observatory within WHO's Secretariat in order to monitor and analyze relevant information on health R&D with a view to contributing to the identification of gaps and opportunities for health R&D and defining priorities in consultation with Member States. The strategy builds on WHO's core functions, which add value in support of global efforts in health research. WHO's strengths stem from its neutral status and independence, a broadest membership with currently 194 Member States an undisputed experience in international public health, a central role in health-related normative matters, a strong tradition and commitment to evidence based decision-making, its ability to convene and to establish and maintain networks of collaboration, both formal and informal, and an organizational set-up allowing to bridge between a central organization, regions and countries. Against this background and building on the principles of quality, impact and inclusiveness, WHO has defined in its roles and responsibilities in health research five interrelated goals:    * Priorities - this concerns the reinforcement of research (at national, regional and global levels, and within WHO) in response to priority health needs;  * Capacity - this relates to the provision of support to the strengthening of national systems for  * health research;  * Standards - this concerns the promotion of good practice in research, drawing on WHO's core function of setting norms and standards;  * Translation - this involves the strengthening of links between the policy, practice and products of research;  * A fifth objective relates to the research competency within WHO.    Since the 1970s WHO has established and run a number of technical programs with research as their primary focus including the special program on Research, Development and Research Training in Human Reproduction (HRP), and the special program on Research and Training in Tropical Diseases (TDR) sponsored jointly with UNESCO, UNDP and the World Bank. Building on this experience, another dedicated research program, the 'Initiative for Vaccine Research' (IVR) was established in 2001 to create a unified entity in support of vaccine and vaccination research. In addition to these dedicated efforts many research activities are embedded into the disease control programs, underlining the policy-relevance and application-orientation of WHO's research work. Significant research activities are conducted in relation to child and adolescent health, HIV, TB, malaria and neglected tropical diseases and increasingly in the areas of health systems and services research, as well as non-communicable diseases (including cancer) and mental health. Based on a 2006/2007 survey (a more recent survey is in preparation), WHO spends 84% of its research expenditure on DALY type I diseases (communicable, maternal, perinatal and nutritional diseases), which represents 40% of the global DALY. 4% is allocated to DALY type II diseases (non-communicable diseases) which represent 48% of global DALY. This apparent imbalance is changing, but also reflects the emphasis of WHO's work on diseases that primarily affect the poor.",12258052; ,"TROEDSSON, HANS ;","MEEGAN, JAMES M",6/15/2013,5/31/2018,Address; adolescent health; Affect; Area; authority; base; Basic Science; Biomedical Research; Child health care; Clinical; Collaborations; Competence; Constitution; Consultations; Country; Decentralization; Decision Making; Development; disability-adjusted life years; Disease; disorder control; Education; Effectiveness; Environment; Epidemic; evidence base; Expenditure; experience; Fostering; Funding; Generations; Generic Drugs; global health; Goals; Government; Health; Health Policy; Health Priorities; Health Services Research; Health system; HIV/TB; Human; innovation; Institutes; Institution; institutional capacity; International; Intervention; Joints; Knowledge; Lead; Link; low and middle-income countries; low income country; Malaria; Malignant Neoplasms; Measures; meetings; member; Mental Health; Monitor; neglected tropical diseases; novel; Nutritional; Perinatal; Policies; Positioning Attribute; Preparation; Process; programs; Psychological reinforcement; Public Health; Public Health Applications Research; public health priorities; Reproduction; Research; Research Activity; research and development; research in practice; Research Infrastructure; Research Training; Resolution; Resources; response; Role; Running; Shapes; stem; Stimulus; Structure; Surveys; systems research; Technology Assessment; Training; Translating; Translations; Tropical Disease; UNESCO; United States National Institutes of Health; Vaccination; Vaccine Research; Vaccines; Work; World Bank; World Health; World Health Organization; ,Enhanced collaboration between US NIH and WHO on biomedical research,108543,ZAI1,Special Emphasis Panel ,,S1,5,175000,22750,197750,

We will use this antibody and antibody-targeted nanosomes for early diagnosis of cartilage lesions by fluorescent arthroscopy and for localized delivery of drugs that may be effective, slowing or preventing disease progression.

One approach to preventing the spread of resistant bacteria is antimicrobial stewardship, or following best practices about when to use antibiotics. One of the most common reasons for antibiotic overuse in VHA hospitals and nursing homes is to treat asymptomatic bacteriuria. Asymptomatic bacteriuria occurs when bacteria colonize the urinary tract without causing related symptoms, and this is a very common condition in older Veterans in both hospitals and nursing homes.

Multi-drug and totally drug resistant strains of P. aeruginosa are increasing threats that contribute to high mortality in these patients. Drug resistant infections are a threat to our Veteran population. Hence there is an urgent need to develop new strategies to combat P. aeruginosa and other resistant pathogens. The pathogenic profile of P. aeruginosa is related to its ability to secrete a variety of virulence factors and promote biofilm formation. Strategies that strengthen the ability of the host to inhibit these virulence factors would enhance host defenses and improve treatment. The goal of this proposal is to define novel molecular approaches to stimulate immune response through pioglitazone (PPAR? agonist) to inhibit bacterial virulence and enhance host defenses. The results from these studies can be readily translated to human clinical trials since pioglitazone is already FDA approved for treatment of diabetes.,6647958; ,"SADIKOT, RUXANA T;",,7/1/2013,12/31/2021,Agonist; Attenuated; base; Binding; Biochemical Genetics; Biological Process; Cells; Clinical; Clinical Trials; combat; Communication; Data; Diabetes Mellitus; Diffuse; Drug resistance; Enzymes; Epithelial; Epithelial Cells; Equilibrium; FDA approved; Funding; Genes; genetic approach; Genetic Transcription; Gluconolactonase; Goals; Health; Homo; Host Defense; Human; Immune; Immune response; Immunocompromised Host; immunoregulation; improved; improved outcome; in vivo; Infection; Inflammation; Innate Immune Response; Knock-out; Knockout Mice; Lactones; Ligands; Link; lipid mediator; Lung; Metabolism; Microbial Biofilms; MicroRNAs; Mitochondria; Molecular; mortality; Multi-Drug Resistance; Mus; mutant; Mutation; N-butyrylhomoserine lactone; Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus; Nose; novel; novel therapeutics; Nuclear Hormone Receptors; overexpression; Oxidation-Reduction; Paraoxonase-2; pathogen; Pathogenicity; Patients; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Pharmacology; Pioglitazone; Population; PPAR gamma; promoter; Promoter Regions; Prostaglandin D2; Proteins; Pseudomonas aeruginosa; quorum sensing; Resistance; resistant strain; respiratory; Serine; Signal Transduction; System; Testing; Therapeutic; Tight Junctions; transcription factor; Translating; Veterans; Virulence; Virulence Factors; Virulent; Work; ,PPARgamma agonism in lung immune response,1786,INFB,Infectious Diseases B ,,A1,6,,,,

We have found that macrophages have the ability to augment their degradation machinery and when this response is stimulated genetically in mice, they have reduced atherosclerosis. Furthermore, we have discovered a safe and natural compound that can stimulate this macrophage degradation response with nearly identical results as the genetic models.

VA performance monitoring makes extensive use of healthcare measures intended to track the delivery of care to all eligible patients who might benefit from it. However, many measures instead track care only to those patients who have qualifying ICD-9 codes in VA administrative data. When there are systematic errors in coded diagnoses, performance monitoring that relies on diagnosis-based measures may fail to identify facilities that need remediation or, conversely, may lead to misallocation of resources to remediate care in facilities that are actually performing well. Diagnosis-based measures also have a critical blind spot, making patients who have the targeted condition but no coded diagnosis essentially invisible to the performance monitoring system.

Elucidate the disease processes that underlie abnormal neuroimaging findings in such Veterans; and (iii) make more progress toward understanding the neuropathology occurring in Veterans with blast-related mTBI.

Progress in the treatment of colorectal cancer has been modest. Signaling molecules known as chemokines are vital in the crosstalk between neoplastic cells and tumor-promoting stroma. Our preliminary data and other supporting studies suggest a crucial role for the chemokine CCL20 and its receptor CCR6 in promoting colorectal cancer through actions on both neoplastic epithelial cells and stromal cells. Thus, targeting this pathway potentially offers the unique advantage of affecting both these elements. While disrupting this pathway for the treatment of colorectal cancer appears promising, this concept has not been well studied. We aim to investigate the efficacy of targeting CCL20-CCR6 interactions in colorectal cancer. The novel orally administered small molecule inhibitor to be tested in these studies offers the potential of being readily translatable.

Our data suggest that oxytocin (OT) may elicit weight loss in diet-induced obese (DIO) rodents by activating BAT to increase EE. We propose to test if activation of BAT is required for OT to elicit weight loss in DIO rodents and to investigate the translational question of whether chronic intranasal OT elicits weight loss, activates BAT and improves glucose tolerance in a DIO nonhuman primate (rhesus monkey) model of metabolic syndrome.

In the proposed work, the zebrafish serves as a novel animal model in which the innate immune response to influenza viral infection will be studied. The roles of cytokines and reactive oxygen species in generating neutrophil responses, as well as the activity of these molecules in controlling viral infection and inflammation, will be elucidated.

The study focuses on the role of mitochondria as a `cellular rheostat' that then elicits responses to allow cells and tissues to adapt to the septic insult by preventing bioenergetic failure, cell death, and organ dysfunction.",8661782; ,"ZUCKERBRAUN, BRIAN SCOTT;",,10/1/2017,9/30/2021,Address; Affect; Aging; Antibiotics; Area; Autophagocytosis; base; Behavior; Bioenergetics; Biogenesis; Biology; Caloric Restriction; Categories; Cause of Death; Cell Death; cell injury; Cells; Cellular biology; Cessation of life; clinically relevant; Complex; Critical Care; Data; Development; Disease; Electron Transport; Energy-Generating Resources; Ensure; Environmental Risk Factor; Epigenetic Process; Event; Evolution; Excision; Failure; Family; Functional disorder; Future; Genetic; Health; Human; improved outcome; Infection; Inflammation; Inflammatory Response; injured; Injury; innovation; insight; Investigation; Killings; Laboratories; Lead; Life Style; lifestyle factors; Longevity; Maintenance; Measures; Mediating; metabolomics; Mitochondria; Modern Medicine; Molecular; Multiple Organ Failure; novel; Organ; organ growth; Organism; Outcome; pathogen; Patient risk; Patients; Pattern; personalized approach; personalized medicine; Physical Exercise; Physiology; Population; prevent; Process; Publishing; reconstitution; Recovery; Regimen; Regulation; Research; Respiration; response; Rewards; Role; Secondary to; Sepsis; septic; Signal Transduction; Stimulus; Stress; Supportive care; Survivors; Syndrome; targeted treatment; Testing; Therapeutic; therapeutic development; Tissues; United States; Veterans; Work; ,The Mitochondria As Regulators Of Inflammation In Sepsis,3924,SURG,Surgery ,,,1,,,,
