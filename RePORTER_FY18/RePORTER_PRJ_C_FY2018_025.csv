In this proposal we aim to combine recent advances in engineering, biology and medicine to develop a human ALD-Chip to address the above unmet needs in human ALD. At Emulate we have proprietary technology on the organs-on-chips we apply to develop human organ-chips that can faithfully recapitulate the architecture and functionality of human organs. Along these lines we have recently developed a human Liver - Chip that provides the best available dynamic human liver model as it concerns organ level functions over a prolonged, four weeks period, we will use for the modelling of the different ALD stages: alcoholic fatty liver, ASH and alcoholic fibrosis. We will focus particularly in the mechanisms and endpoints associated with the potential for reversibility of the pathology, as described in human patients.

In this study, we will employ functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to compare functional neurocircuitry underlying these core psychological domains in highly resilient World Trade Center (WTC) responders compared to (1) symptomatic responders with chronic, clinically significant, WTC- related posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms and (2) low-exposed control responders with low WTC exposure and without any psychiatric history. Characterization of the functional neurocircuitry underlying emotion regulation, positive emotions, and the ability to harness social support in highly resilient WTC responders is critical to elucidating the etiology of psychological resilience, as well as to informing personalized prevention and treatment approaches that bolster function of specific neural circuits in WTC and other disaster responders, and other populations of trauma survivors.",15265135 (contact); 10641391; ,"CDC DEFAULT PERSON, CDC DEFAULT PERSON  (contact); PIETRZAK, ROBERT H;",,7/1/2017,6/30/2021,,"Neuroimaging of Resilience in World Trade Center Responders: A Focus on Emotional Processing, Reward and Social Cognition",11473,ZOH1,Special Emphasis Panel ,,,2,,,599086,

Our progress made in the last funding period have led us to recapitulate in vitro limbal niches exhibiting stem cell self-renewal and quiescence upon close contact with limbal niche cells. Hence, we propose to characterize the signaling pathways transmitted from the novel matrix, HC-HA/PTX3 (derived from amniotic membrane), to limbal niche cells and finally to limbal epithelial stem cells in controlling quiescence and self- renewal, of which both are critical for maintaining the stem cell pool. We believe that these studies will make a significant advance in the field of regenerative medicine by generating important knowledge that will unravel new therapeutic paradigms through restoration of the limbal niche health.

Although the exact causes of alcohol addiction have yet to be fully elucidated, binge drinking during adolescence has been linked to an increased risk of developing alcoholism later in life. This relationship may be explained by ethanol-induced alterations in brain development during adolescence. We think that understanding how alcohol affects the adolescent brain might provide new insight into how alcohol addiction develops, and these insights might, in turn, lead to new treatments. This project focuses on the effects of alcohol on development of the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), a brain region that matures during adolescence. Using an animal model of binge drinking, these studies aim to discover how alcohol affects the excitability of neurons in the developing mPFC, and to develop new ways to reverse the consequences of adolescent drinking.",10624456; ,"SKELLY, MARY JANE;","LIU, QI-YING",3/13/2017,1/12/2019,addiction; Adolescence; Adolescent; adolescent alcohol; adolescent binge drinking; Adult; Affect; Alcohol consumption; Alcohol dependence; alcohol effect; alcohol exposure; alcohol use disorder; Alcohol withdrawal syndrome; Alcoholic Intoxication; Alcoholism; Alcohols; Amygdaloid structure; Anatomy; Animal Model; Area; attenuation; Behavioral; behavioral outcome; binge drinking; Brain; Brain region; Characteristics; Chronic; critical developmental period; critical period; cyclic nucleotide-gated cation channel; Data; design; Development; Disease; drinking; Elderly; Electrophysiology (science); Emotional; Ethanol; experimental study; Family; Goals; HCN1 gene; hippocampal pyramidal neuron; hyperpolarization-activated cation channel; Immunohistochemistry; in vivo; Individual; insight; Intake; Lead; Life; Link; male; mature animal; Medial; Mediating; Membrane; Membrane Potentials; Methods; molecular targeted therapies; motivated behavior; mouse model; Mus; Neurobiology; Neurons; new therapeutic target; novel; Opsin; optogenetics; Output; patch clamp; Pathway interactions; Phenotype; Play; Predisposition; Prefrontal Cortex; prevent; problem drinker; Recording of previous events; Regulation; Relapse; Reporting; Rest; Rewards; Risk; Risk Factors; Role; Self Administration; Self-Administered; Societies; Structure; Testing; Time; underage drinking; Ventral Striatum; Ventral Tegmental Area; young adult; ,Impact of Adolescent Alcohol on Development of the Prefrontal Cortex,25530,ZAA1,Special Emphasis Panel ,,,3,49030,,49030,

Although HCL and the SH both share common gene mutations in BRAF (BRAFV600E) and MAP2K1, these are distinct blood cancers with different clinical behaviors; however, their actual cells of origin and pathogenic differences are poorly understood, which led to our project goal of determining how BRAFV600E, MAP2K1, and other MAPK pathway mutations contribute to the pathogenesis of distinct blood cancers and affect their clinical responses to MAPK pathway inhibitors. This research proposal seeks to advance our understanding of the actual cells of origin of cancer-causing MAPK mutations in HCL and the SH, to determine why BRAFV600E and MAP2K1 mutations can cause two distinct blood cancers, and to understand how these mutations in HCL and SH influence responses to MAPK pathway inhibitor drugs that could potentially become effective therapy for these poorly understood blood cancers.",14759723; ,"DURHAM, BENJAMIN HEATH;","LIM, SUSAN E",3/13/2018,2/28/2023,Advisory Committees; Affect; Aftercare; Behavior; Biological; Biological Assay; Biological Response Modifier Therapy; BRAF gene; Cancer Center; Cancer Etiology; career; CD34 gene; Cells; Clinical; Clinical Trials; Derivation procedure; Development; Developmental Biology; Disease; Disease model; disease phenotype; effective therapy; Environment; Epithelial; Event; Exhibits; Faculty; Frequencies; functional genomics; Gene Mutation; Genetic; Genetic Transcription; Genomics; Goals; Hairy Cell Leukemia; Hairy Cell Leukemia Variant; Hematologic Neoplasms; Hematological Disease; Hematopoietic; Hematopoietic Neoplasms; Hematopoietic stem cells; histiocyte; In Vitro; in vivo; inhibitor/antagonist; innovation; insight; kinase inhibitor; Lesion; Malignant Neoplasms; MAP2K1 gene; Maps; member; Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center; Mentors; Mentorship; Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases; Molecular; Molecular Genetics; mouse model; Mus; mutant; Mutate; Mutation; Nature; Neoplasms; novel therapeutic intervention; novel therapeutics; Oncogenic; Pathogenesis; Pathogenicity; Pathologic; Pathologist; Pathology; Pathway interactions; Patient Care; patient subsets; Patients; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Phase; Phase II Clinical Trials; Phenotype; Phosphotransferases; Physicians; Population; Pre-Clinical Model; Privatization; programs; Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt; Relapse; Reporting; Research; Research Proposals; Resistance; Resistance development; response; Role; Sampling; Scientist; Series; Signal Pathway; Signal Transduction; skills; small molecule; System; targeted treatment; tenure track; Testing; Therapeutic; therapeutic evaluation; Tissues; Training; Treatment Efficacy; Variant; Work; Xenograft Model; Xenograft procedure; ,"Cellular Origins, Molecular Pathogenesis, and Novel Therapeutic Strategies for MAP Kinase-Driven Hematological Malignancies",218901,NCI,Subcommittee I - Transistion to Independence ,,A1,1,193208,15457,208665,

The long-term goal of this research project is to better understand the molecular mechanisms involved in AILI in order to identify new therapeutic agents that will complement NAC in the treatment of AILI. Previous work has demonstrated a hepato-protective function of hepatic M?s in AILI. Our recent data suggest that hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)2? may be important in mediating this protection. Successful completion of the proposed studies will not only provide insight into endogenous protective mechanisms during AILI, but also identify a potential therapeutic target.

It employs a wide variety of strategies to recognize and remove microbes and distressed cells, as well as providing the protective immunity against future infections that forms the basis of vaccination. The immune system may also respond too aggressively, as in various forms of allergy, or may attack the body's own cells, as in autoimmune diseases. The cells of the immune system have to interpret a wide variety of signals to response in an appropriate manner to a given challenge. How these signals are received, transmitted, and interpreted forms the scope of this important conference series. The series is notable because it attracts a unique group of immunologists focused on genes and their mechanisms of action whose research is at the cutting edge in defining how the immune system functions.",7039607; ,"STEWART, DAVID J.;","MILLER, LARA R",3/14/2018,2/28/2019,American; Animal Model; Animals; Antigen Receptors; Applications Grants; Area; austin; Autoimmune Diseases; Autoimmunity; B-Lymphocytes; Bacteria; Biochemistry; Biological Models; career development; Cell Differentiation process; Cell physiology; cell type; Cells; Chromatin; Clinical Data; Collaborations; Communicable Diseases; Complement; Congresses; cytokine; Data; Development; Discipline; Disease; Distress; Ensure; Environment; Epigenetic Process; Event; Evolution; Faculty; field study; Financial Support; Fostering; Funding; Future; Gene Expression; Gene Expression Regulation; Genes; Genetic; Genetic Transcription; Goals; graduate student; host-microbe interactions; Human; Hypersensitivity; Immune; Immune response; Immune system; immune system function; Immunity; Immunologic Memory; Immunologist; Immunology; Industrialization; Infection; intercellular communication; interest; International; Knowledge; Laboratories; Link; London; Malignant Neoplasms; meetings; Membrane; Metabolism; Microbe; Microbiology; Molecular; Molecular Analysis; Molecular Biology; multidisciplinary; National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease; Natural Immunity; Oral; Participant; pathogen; Pathway interactions; Pharmacology; Physiology; Postdoctoral Fellow; posters; Process; Recording of previous events; Regulation; Research; Research Institute; Research Personnel; response; Running; Scientist; Series; Signal Transduction; structural biology; success; symposium; T-Lymphocyte; Time; Transcriptional Regulation; Vaccination; virology; Virus; Woman; Work; ,CSHL Gene Expression and Signaling in the Immune System Conference,138870,ZAI1,Special Emphasis Panel ,,,1,8000,,8000,

Antisense therapies will provide for a more reliable treatment for C. difficile infection by targeting C. difficile with molecular precision, while leaving the other gut bacteria largely undisturbed, thus avoiding the intestinal dysbiosis which is associated with all conventional antibiotics and which is prerequisite for C. difficile infection to develop. The further development of this approach would potentially allow the expansion of targets to include such disease elements as toxin production and spore formation, allowing for new therapeutic interventions which are currently beyond the reach of conventional therapies.",8498319; 10368776 (contact); ,"SHARMA, ARUN KUMAR; STEWART, DAVID B.

No where is this need clearer than for the brain systems controlling social behavior and emotion, where dysregulation of circuitry has been implicated in the most devastating mental illnesses. Animal models have been important in beginning to understand these diseases but it is now clear that the field must pay serious attention to Humans-First. Using an entirely new approach, highly multidisciplinary partnerships between neuroscientists and engineers and information theorists, we have found a powerful way to provide these. This dream is the vision and reality of this proposal. Autism spectrum disorder (ASD), anxiety, depression, addiction and schizophrenia alone affect the lives of more than 70 million children and adults in the USA at a cost of more than $300 billion per year and incalculable human suffering. State-of-the-art superb NIH and foundation consortia have expressed dire need for biomarkers for ASD and the crushing effects of anxiety, depression. There is no time to be wasted and no way to replace the years lost for our nation's families. It is the goal of this proposal to accelerate greatly the pace of developing novel therapeutics and deep understanding of these mental illnesses through bridging the current chasm between finding a gene and understanding its role in determining human social behavior, and to speed the transformation of these insights to understand the causes and best treatments for mental illnesses that all take their toll on the sensitive balance of brain circuitry essential for a productive life.

In 2014, HemoShear, LLC and Children's National Health System formed a strategic partnership to systematize and accelerate discovery and treatments for rare diseases of the liver. Under this partnership, tissue and biomaterial from patients treated at Children's can be used to validate the rare disease system developed at HemoShear for the identification of targets for therapeutic development. This study will focus on the biochemical group of diseases called organic acidemias. These rare diseases have high early and late mortality rates, there are no primary therapies for these conditions and patients often undergo liver transplant to control symptoms.
