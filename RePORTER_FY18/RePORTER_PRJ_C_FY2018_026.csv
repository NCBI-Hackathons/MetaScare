A visualized abnormality on imaging enormously improves the chances of epilepsy surgery helping the patient. Yet, a substantial fraction of refractory epilepsy patients are ?nonlesional? ? i.e., have normal brain scans. My project will advance the application of a novel, low-cost, and easily-implemented method of MRI brain scanning - while the patient inhales 100% oxygen - to identify imaging abnormalities in nonlesional patients, so that epilepsy surgery can be performed with greater success. The method has been successful in my pilot studies, and will be extended to better define important brain areas for language, motor and memory function, so that epilepsy surgery is also safer in these patients.",9439287; ,"KALAMANGALAM, GIRIDHAR PADMANABHAN;","STEWART, RANDALL R",2/1/2018,6/30/2018,,Advancing Diagnosis and Functional Localization in Focal Epilepsy with Oxygen-Enhanced MRI,79900,NST,NST-2 Subcommittee ,,,6,107407,8593,116000,

Thus, it is not surprising that disturbance in normal biotin homeostasis (biotin deficiency and sub-optimal levels) leads to negative metabolic and health consequences. Such disturbances have been reported with increased frequency in recent years and shown to occur in a variety of conditions that include inflammatory bowel diseases, chronic alcoholism, in inborn errors of biotin metabolism, long-term use of anticonvulsant drugs, and during pregnancy. Thus, studies that are aimed at improving biotin body homeostasis are of clear physiological and nutritional importance.  We have known for some times that the intestinal biotin absorption process is via a Na+-dependent and regulated carrier-mediated process. In studies performed during the current funding period, we have generated an SMVT knockout mouse model and showed that the SMVT system is the only biotin uptake system that operates in the gut. Surprisingly, however, we observed that all the SMVT-/- mice develop spontaneous active intestinal inflammation, especially in the cecum. The latter suggests a possible role for biotin/ SMVT in the maintenance of normal intestinal health. We plan in this proposal to further characterize this intestinal phenotype and to delineate the mechanisms that lead to its development. We also aim at determining the mechanisms involved in the inhibition of biotin absorption that we recently observed as a result of salmonella infection, and following exposure to pro-inflammatory cytokines (as in inflammatory bowel diseases), and to bacterial LPS (as in infection with gram negative enteric pathogens) affect the absorption of the indispensable micronutrient biotin in the gut. Finally, we aim at delineating the epigenetic/molecular mechanisms involved in the inhibitory effect of chronic exposure to alcohol (the most common and costly drug abuse) on transcription of the SLC5A6 gene (i. e., the gene that encodes SMVT).",1874254; ,"SAID, HAMID M;","MARUVADA, PADMA",9/15/2000,7/31/2020,,INTESTINAL BIOTIN ABSORPTION: PHYSIOLOGICAL AND PATHOPHYSIOLOGICAL ASPECTS,58057,CIMG,"Clinical, Integrative and Molecular Gastroenterology Study Section ",,,19,407956,205666,613622,

Family psychoeducation (FPE) is an evidence-based practice from high-income countries that could have a significant impact in settings such as Africa and other regions worldwide where resources are limited, families are largely responsible for care and support, and traditional beliefs and treatments are common. This R34 will pilot test a newly adapted and culturally tailored FPE intervention called FamPE for adults living with psychotic disorders in Tanzania and also examine the mechanisms of action for FamPE in order to inform a subsequent larger trial that is consistent with NIMH's priority for ?effectiveness research on preventive and therapeutic interventions with previously demonstrated efficacy for use with broader target populations?
