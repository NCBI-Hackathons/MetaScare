We have observed up-regulation of this receptor in the substantia nigra and white blood cells (WBCs) of the PD patients. Niacin (Vitamin B3) acts as an agonist to this receptor and our preliminary findings in PD patients demonstrates its regulatory effects on GPR109A levels in WBCs.

The proposed study will harness the ecological momentary assessment (EMA) design to create an integrated tool for (1) multifaceted assessment of PWB and (2) delivering PWB interventions in real life settings, with person-centered statistical inference tailored for developing and evaluating EMA-based approaches to increase PWB. This rigorous assessment approach will have broad implications for reducing national health disparities. Understanding individual differences in the underlying pathways through which PWB-EMA affects PWB can effectively benefit future study participants who would profit from assessment tools that increase PWB as a byproduct of the research itself, further promoting mental health on a broader level. Moreover, practitioners of PWB intervention may improve efficacy by using PWB- EMAI together with a user-friendly statistical toolkit that facilitates person-specific monitoring and rigorous assessment in real life settings. Lastly, PWB-EMAIs are highly universal and may drastically increase the amount of people we could impact, and level of mental health we could improve. Rigorous assessment from this research will point to new platforms for creating and disseminating effective PWB interventions in real life settings. Improving the efficacy of PWB intervention in everyday life contexts will contribute to positively, and lastingly transforming the health of our society.

We will test a unified model of sexual minority and HIV-related stress on biomarkers of physiological stress (i.e., cortisol) and immune (i.e., viral load, CD4, cytokines) responses using twice-daily ecological momentary assessment (EMA) for 21 days and quarterly longitudinal follow-ups over 12 months to prospectively test the proposed model. We will use self-reported surveys and neurocognitive assessments to quantitatively examine the impact of these stressors on HIV-related health outcomes, and end by developing guidelines to inform the development of future interventions aimed at improving HIV treatment and prevent HIV transmission.",10767419; ,"RENDINA, H.
