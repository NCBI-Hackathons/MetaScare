According to the World Health Organization, almost 80 million people have been infected with the HIV virus since the beginning of the epidemic, and almost 40 million people have died of HIV. Sub-Saharan Africa remains most severely affected, with nearly 1 in every 20 adults living with HIV and accounting for nearly 71% of the people living with HIV worldwide. Many conferences around the world address a plethora of issues related to the treatment of HIV/AIDS, but few do so by addressing the underlying biology of the virus, and even fewer do this by putting the molecular biology of the virus and its interaction with its human host in the broader context of how all retroviruses, irrespective of host, function and evolve. A key to the success of the Cold Spring Harbor annual retroviruses conference is that the majority of oral presentations are given by graduate students, postdoctoral fellows and junior faculty chosen on the basis of scientific merit, ensuring that the conference showcases the latest developments which are often yet to be published. Participants come from academic centers, research institutes and industrial centers around the world to present and discuss their findings. Many of the currently important treatments for HIV/AIDS were first presented or proposed at this conference in past years. Importantly, this application requests support for junior scientists who might not otherwise be able to attend to actively participate in the meeting.

Unfortunately however, these homeostasis mechanisms can be overcome in situations of neurological diseases or injury that result in neuronal dysfunctions leading to disability or death of patients. We have identified a key molecule, called miR-29, which has an essential function in maintaining the mature brain during normal healthy aging. The experiments we propose focus on investigating the precise mechanisms of action of miR-29 as well as test its efficacy in models of Alzheimer?s Disease.

Early childhood recurrent abdominal pain is associated with impairment: absences from preschool or daycare, stress on the parent-child relationship, and costly doctor bills. Some children with early abdominal pain also learn to fear body sensations in general - becoming afraid whenever the body fluctuates but is functioning normally (e.g., the gut pangs of hunger). Recurrent childhood abdominal pain predicts chronic pain and psychiatric disorders later in childhood and into adulthood. There are no interventions for very young children with functional abdominal pain. We propose to develop and pilot an innovative early intervention for FAP based on research that FAP results from (1) the influence of pain on the neurodevelopment of the gut-brain axis and (2) maladaptive parent-child interactions that inadvertently increase the child's somatic fear. Our ten session intervention teaches 5-8 year old children with recurrent abdominal pain to be 'Feeling and Body Investigators.' Children will learn to go on 'missions' to investigate and test the functioning of their body and to record their observations (clues). Children will become 'FBI' explorers of the mysteries of the body with their caregivers who will participate in the treatment as role models and supports for their children. By creating an early intervention within the context of fun and curiosity, we aim not only to diminish young children's somatic symptoms, pain, and fear, but also to improve young children's self-regulatory capacities more generally. Children will learn to use body signals to guide adaptive behavior (e.g., to eat when they experience the gut pangs of hunger) while not allowing body sensations to get in the way of activities (e.g., to not let gut butterflies lead to school absence). The study has two phases: (1) an R21 phase for development of the intervention and testing with 26 child-parent pairs and (2) an R33 phase to conduct a pilot-test with 100 children and parents to examine the feasibility, acceptability, and clinical significance of our FBI treatment compared with an active control treatment. With this innovative early childhood intervention for a common childhood somatic complaint, we hope to both treat and prevent recurrent pain disorders, fear-based psychiatric disorders, and body preoccupation/distortion disorders that impair so many children and adults. The success of our neuroscience-based early intervention approach will also have broad public health implications for how we treat and prevent chronic pain and promote physical and mental health across the lifespan.","6764460; ","ZUCKER, NANCY L;","WAGNER, ANN","09/26/2013","03/31/2019","8 year old; Abdominal Pain; active control; Adaptive Behaviors; Address; Adult; Aftercare; Age; Anxiety; Awareness; base; Basic Science; Behavior; Behavior Therapy; Behavioral; Brain; Butterflies; Caregivers; Caring; Child; Childhood; chronic abdominal pain; chronic pain; chronic painful condition; Clinic; Clinical; clinically significant; cost; Curiosities; design; Development; Developmental Course; Diagnostic tests; diaries; Disease; Distress; early childhood; Early Intervention; Eating; Education; Educational Intervention; emotion regulation; emotional experience; Emotions; Enrollment; Epidemiologic Methods; Esthesia; Evaluation; experience; Face; Family; fascinate; Feeling; Fright; functional disability; fundamental research; Future; group intervention; Health; health care service utilization; Home environment; Homeostasis; Hunger; Impairment; improved; improved functioning; innovation; Internet; Intervention; Label; Laboratories; Lead; Learning; Link; Longevity; Medical; Mental disorders; Mental Health; Mission; Moods; neural circuit; neural patterning; neurodevelopment; Neurosciences; Neurosciences Research; novel; Nursery Schools; Pain; Pain Disorder; Pain management; Parent-Child Relations; Parents; Participant; Phase; physical conditioning; prevent; Prevention; Primary Health Care; Psychopathology; Psychophysiologic Disorders; Public Health; public health relevance; Randomized; Recurrence; Recurrent pain; Regulation; Research; research and development; Research Personnel; Research Support; response; Risk; role model; Safety; Sampling; satisfaction; Schools; Signal Transduction; Social Change; Social Environment; Stress; success; Symptoms; Syndrome; Testing; therapy development; Training; Translating; Translational Research; treatment program; Viscera; Visceral; Visceral pain; Weight; Work; ","Feelings/Body Investigators:Interoceptive Exposure for Children w/Abdominal Pain","097959","ZMH1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","S1","05","26904","16075","42979",""

The medical importance of Ras is highlighted by its frequent mutational activation in human cancers. We have discovered an entirely new paradigm in Ras signaling in which nucleotide-free Ras (nfRas) inhibits cellular signaling pathways. We have isolated unique reagents to probe the function of nfRas in cells and animal models for cancer. Our work will define a new paradigm in Ras signaling that has important implications for our understanding of Ras-driven cancers. Given the evolutionary conservation of Ras and its involvement in human biology, these studies are of broad interest to many investigators. In addition, this work will have translational significance and relevance to Veterans which are at an increased risk for many Ras mutant cancers.","1881786; ","O'BRYAN, JOHN P.;","","10/01/2013","12/31/2020","1-Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinase; Address; Affect; Affinity; Amino Acids; Animal Cancer Model; Area; base; Binding; Binding Proteins; Biological; Biology; Biomedical Research; cancer therapy; Cell Fraction; Cell model; Cell physiology; Cells; chemical genetics; Chronic; Colorectal Cancer; Data; Development; Environment; Eukaryota; Exhibits; Extracellular Domain; Family; Family member; Funding; General Population; genetic approach; Goals; Growth; Growth Factor Oncogenes; GTP Binding; Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors; Guanosine Triphosphate; Guanosine Triphosphate Phosphohydrolases; Health; Human; Human Biology; improved; In Vitro; in vivo; Incidence; inhibitor/antagonist; insight; interest; Knowledge; KRAS2 gene; Lung; malignant breast neoplasm; Malignant neoplasm of lung; Malignant neoplasm of pancreas; Malignant Neoplasms; Measures; Mediating; Medical; Modeling; Molecular; Molecular Conformation; mutant; Mutate; Mutation; Normal Cell; novel; Nucleotides; Oncogenes; Oncogenic; Oxidation-Reduction; Pancreas; pancreatic tumorigenesis; Phosphotransferases; Play; Population; predictive modeling; Prevalence; prevent; programs; Proteins; RAS genes; ras Proteins; Reagent; receptor; Regulation; Reporting; Repression; Research; Research Personnel; Risk; Role; Signal Pathway; Signal Transduction; Signal Transduction Pathway; Specificity; steroid hormone receptor; Technology; Tertiary Protein Structure; tool; tumor; tumorigenesis; Veterans; Work; ","Novel Functions for Ras family GTPases","002095","ONCC","Oncology C ","","","05","","","",""

Enteric infections have a significant impact on the health of populations in poorer settings, even in the absence of overt diarrhea. Although some infections of major importance can be prevented by vaccination, oral vaccines are insufficiently effective in resource-limited settings--exactly where they are most needed. This collaborative training program originally between Tufts University and Christian Medical College in Vellore, India is being expanded to include the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta for additional training in epidemiology and vaccine impact monitoring and to the Baylor College of Medicine, Houston for training in virology and additional expertise in microbiome studies. In addition to expand the reach of the training program beyond a single Indian institution, the Indian program faculty will partner with the Department of Biotechnology's Clinica Development Service Agency in the development and implementation of the Indian Clinical Researcher Development (InCReD) program which plans to reach 15-20 young faculty at Indian medical schools in the first phase through a combination of credit based distance learning and in-person courses. The expected deliverables are therefore in two main categories, i) three levels of trainees who can contribute to the development of research programs and grow into independent investigators capable of leading research programs in India and ii) a course that supports the development of research skills among young faculty in medical schools across India.","7920320; ","KANG, GAGANDEEP ;","SINA, BARBARA J","08/15/2005","02/28/2021","Applications Grants; base; Bioinformatics; Biotechnology; career development; Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.); Child; Clinical; Clinical Research; Clinical Services; cognitive development; college; Communicable Diseases; Developing Countries; Development; Discipline; Distance Learning; Doctor's Degree; Enteral; Epidemiology; experience; Faculty; gastrointestinal infection; Goals; Government; Growth; gut microbiome; Immune response; Immunization; Immunology; India; Infant Mortality; Infection; Infectious Diseases Research; Interdisciplinary Study; Intervention; Knowledge; Medical center; medical schools; Medicine; Mentors; Metagenomics; Morbidity - disease rate; multidisciplinary; oral vaccine; Paper; Performance; pre-doctoral; Program Development; programs; Public Health; Public Health Practice; Publications; Research; Research Personnel; Research Project Grants; Research Training; Resources; response; Risk Assessment; Role; skills; Training; training aid; Training Programs; translational approach; Translational Research; Universities; vaccinology; Work; ","Building enteric infectious disease research capacity in India","007392","ZRG1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","13","237078","18966","256044",""

This is relevant to the NIH's mission because it will not only lead to a better understanding of how muscles change but also, though the application of simulations, how these changes impact basic arm function (e.g., reaching and grasping) in individuals with chronic stroke. Finally, the proposed study will provide clear direction to clinicians and patients as to which changes in muscle properties are most devastating for implementation of activities of daily living with the paretic upper extremity. Thisis expected to lead to changes in the type of future clinical interventions that will be implemented to reduce or eliminate maladaptive changes in upper extremity skeletal muscles following stroke.","1974015 (contact); 11506971; ","DEWALD, JULIUS P (contact); MURRAY, WENDY M;","CRUZ, THERESA","06/01/2015","03/31/2019","Activities of Daily Living; Address; Affect; Age; Anatomy; Architecture; Area; arm; arm function; arm movement; arm paresis; base; biomechanical model; Brachial Paresis; Brain; Chronic; chronic stroke; Clinical; cohort; Contracture; Contralateral; Coupled; Coupling; Data; design; Development; disability; Eating; Elbow; Elbow joint structure; experience; Extensor; Fascicle; Fatty acid glycerol esters; Finger joint structure; Fingers; Flexor; functional disability; Future; Generations; grasp; Hand; Hand functions; hemiparetic stroke; Hygiene; Impairment; in vivo; Individual; Infiltration; Intervention; Isometric Exercise; joint stiffness; Joints; Lead; Length; Lifting; Limb structure; Link; Literature; Long-Term Effects; Lower Extremity; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Measurement; Measures; Mechanics; Methods; Microscopy; Mission; Modeling; Motion; motor impairment; Movement; Muscle; Muscle function; Musculoskeletal; Musculoskeletal System; neuroregulation; novel; Outcome; Paresis; Patients; Pattern; Physiological; Posture; prevent; Property; Public Health; public health relevance; Publishing; Recovery; Rehabilitation therapy; relating to nervous system; Research; Rest; Role; Sarcomeres; Signal Transduction; simulation; Skeletal Muscle; spasticity; standard measure; Sterile coverings; stroke; stroke survivor; synergism; Techniques; Testing; Time; tool; two-photon; Ultrasonography; United States National Institutes of Health; Upper Extremity; Work; Wrist; Wrist joint; ","Motor impairment related changes in muscles properties in chronic stroke","084009","MABS","Modeling and Analysis of Biological Systems Study Section ","","","04","330117","101297","431414",""

Current evidence demonstrates that women with milder forms of hyperglycemia or elevated blood sugar (approximately 13% who do not meet the criteria for GDM under the current testing guidelines) may share these same risks as those with GDM. Better identification and treatment of these women with mild hyperglycemia may result in improved perinatal outcomes and a decreased risk of future diabetes. Under the current GDM screening strategy, these women are considered 'normal' but a one-step strategy with more strict diagnostic criteria would better identify these women.

These pathways are crucial in the active termination of the inflammatory response, and their disruption may contribute to ongoing unresolved inflammation, which has been observed not only during periods of sleep restriction, but also after recovery sleep has been obtained. If our hypothesis is true, it is possible that increasing the body?s natural production of endogenous, inflammatory resolution mediators may provide a non-behavioral strategy to limit the inflammatory consequences in those undergoing periods of sleep restriction with intermittent recovery sleep.","8439583; ","HAACK, MONIKA ;","BROWN, MARISHKA","04/15/2018","02/28/2023","Affect; Age; Anti-inflammatory; Aspirin; Back; base; Behavior; Biological Markers; Blood specimen; chemokine; cytokine; Data; design; Development; disorder risk; Dose; Down-Regulation; experience; Experimental Models; Exposure to; Failure; Future; Goals; Habits; Health; Homeostasis; hospital utilization; Hospitals; Human; human disease; Individual; Inflammation; Inflammatory; inflammatory marker; Inflammatory Response; Interleukin-6; Interleukins; Laboratories; Lead; Length of Stay; lipid biosynthesis; lipid mediator; Liquid Chromatography; Measures; Mediator of activation protein; men; monocyte; Nonesterified Fatty Acids; novel; novel strategies; Omega-3 Fatty Acids; Participant; Pathogenesis; Pathway interactions; Pattern; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Pharmacology; Phase; Placebos; Play; Polysomnography; Process; Production; Recovery; Recurrence; Reporting; Resolution; response; Role; Series; shift work; Signal Transduction; Sleep; sleep regulation; tandem mass spectrometry; Testing; Time; Up-Regulation; Woman; Work; ","Patterns of Sleep Restriction and Recovery: The Inflammatory Resolution Pathways","136310","MESH","Biobehavioral Mechanisms of Emotion, Stress and Health Study Section ","","A1","01","490481","336747","827228",""

Wolfram syndrome is a rare autosomal recessive genetic disorder characterized by juvenile-onset diabetes and neurodegeneration. Wolfram syndrome is considered as a prototype of ER disorder. Its monogenic etiology makes Wolfram syndrome more amenable to discover drugs targeting ER dysfunction than other common conditions in which multiple factors typically interact to produce the disease manifestations. Successful completion of our clinical trial for Wolfram syndrome may lead to a breakthrough for treatments of such common diseases, especially type 1 and type 2 diabetes.","7750808; ","URANO, FUMIHIKO ;","EGGERMAN, THOMAS L","04/01/2017","03/31/2019","Activities of Daily Living; Adolescent; Adult; Atrophic; balance testing; Beta Cell; Biological Markers; C-Peptide; Calcium; Cell Death; Cell physiology; Cells; Cessation of life; Childhood; Chronic Disease; Clinical Trials; Cytosol; Dantrolene; Defect; Diabetes Insipidus; Diabetes Mellitus; disability; Disease; Dose; Drug Targeting; Endoplasmic Reticulum; Etiology; Extravasation; FDA approved; Functional disorder; health related quality of life; hearing impairment; Hereditary Disease; Human; induced pluripotent stem cell; Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus; Lead; Link; Malignant hyperpyrexia due to anesthesia; Maximum Tolerated Dose; Modeling; Molecular; mouse model; Mutation; Myelin Basic Proteins; Nerve Degeneration; Neurologic; Neurologic Symptoms; Neurons; Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus; novel; open label; Optic Nerve; Oral; outcome forecast; Pathogenesis; Patients; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Phase; Plant Roots; polypeptide C; preclinical study; premature; prevent; prototype; recessive genetic trait; Retinal Ganglion Cells; Ryanodine Receptors; Safety; Serum; Sodium; spasticity; Spectrin; Structure of beta Cell of islet; Syndrome; targeted treatment; Testing; Therapeutic; Therapeutic Agents; Tungsten; Visual Acuity; WFS1 gene; Wolfram Syndrome; ","CLINICAL TRIAL OF DANTROLENE SODIUM IN PATIENTS WITH WOLFRAM SYNDROME","113487","TAG","Therapeutic Approaches to Genetic Diseases Study Section ","","","02","112500","59062","171562",""

We now propose to explore if restoration of the NO/cGMP pathway with novel NO/cGMP-generating agents can prevent bone loss in a mouse model of type I diabetes; these studies will lay the foundation for developing a new anabolic treatment for diabetic osteoporosis.","1858029; ","PILZ, RENATE B;","ALEKEL, D LEE","04/01/2016","03/31/2021","Affect; analog; Antioxidants; Apoptotic; Architecture; Attention; beta catenin; Biomechanics; bone; Bone Density; Bone Diseases; bone loss; bone quality; Calcium; Cells; cGMP production; Clinical Trials; cobinamide; Complications of Diabetes Mellitus; Cyclic GMP; Cyclic GMP-Dependent Protein Kinases; Data; Defect; Defense Mechanisms; Development; Diabetes Mellitus; diabetic; diabetic patient; effective therapy; enzyme pathway; Enzymes; Foundations; Fracture; Fracture Healing; fracture risk; functional restoration; Gene Expression; Gene Expression Profiling; gene repression; Generations; Genes; Glucose; Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3; Growth; Guanylate Cyclase; Heme Group; Hip Fractures; Human; Hydrogen Peroxide; Impairment; improved; in vivo; Insulin; Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus; Insulin-Like Growth Factor I; Knockout Mice; Lead; Mechanical Stimulation; Mediating; Metabolism; microCT; Mitochondria; Molecular; mouse model; Mus; NADPH Oxidase; Nitric Oxide; Nitric Oxide Donors; Nitric Oxide Synthase; Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus; NOS3 gene; novel; novel therapeutics; Osteoblasts; Osteogenesis; Osteoporosis; oxidation; oxidative damage; Oxidative Stress; Oxides; Parents; Pathway interactions; Patients; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Phenotype; Phosphorylation; Play; Post-Translational Protein Processing; Postmenopause; prevent; Production; protective effect; public health relevance; Reactive Oxygen Species; reconstitution; response; restoration; Risk; Role; Secondary to; Serum Markers; Signal Pathway; Signal Transduction; skeletal; Soluble Guanylate Cyclase; Streptozocin; substantia spongiosa; Superoxides; Testing; Tissues; Transcriptional Regulation; treatment strategy; TXN gene; Viral; Vitamin B 12; Vitamin D; Wild Type Mouse; Woman; ","Targeting defective NO/cGMP signaling as novel therapy for diabetic osteoporosis","068601","SBDD","Skeletal Biology Development and Disease Study Section ","","","03","242937","133615","376552",""

Using a single-nucleus profiling approach, we plan to investigate the extent of disease heterogeneity and the specific effect(s) of DUX4 upregulation.

It remains unclear whether changes in ASD incidence are contributing to such increased rates of ASD; this uncertainty may lend credence to concerns that environmental factors and gene-environmental interactions (GEX) are increasing the risks for ASD. Detecting the causes of ASD has proven to be challenging for many reasons, including the complexity of ASD genetics and GEX, as well as the difficulty in doing adequately designed studies. This proposal will use a very large, total population study of children with ASD, their families and matched controls, to identify some causes of ASD by first estimating ASD cumulative incidence and then examining the roles of environmental factors and GEX in creating risks for ASD.","6666787; ","KIM, YOUNG SHIN ;","LAWLER, CINDY P","07/01/2012","12/22/2018","Address; Age; Architecture; autism spectrum disorder; Autistic Disorder; Awareness; Behavior assessment; biobank; Birth; Blood; Cell Line; Child; Cities; Clinical; cohort; Collection; Community Surveys; Data; design; Diagnosis; Diagnostic; Disease; DNA; drinking; Environmental Impact; Environmental Risk Factor; Epidemiology; established cell line; Etiology; Exposure to; Family; Foundations; Funding; Future; gene environment interaction; Genes; Genetic; Genetic Markers; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Genetic study; Genotype; Goals; Heavy Metals; Hereditary Disease; Heterogeneity; High Prevalence; Hormones; Immunologic Markers; Incidence; Individual; Koreans; Maternal Age; Maternal Health; Measurement; Measures; Medical; Medical History; Neuropsychological Tests; Parental Ages; Parents; perinatal complications; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Phenotype; Physical Examination; Population; population based; Population Study; postnatal; Pregnancy Complications; prenatal exposure; Prevalence; proband; Procedures; Process; prospective; Prospective cohort; Psychopathology; Public Health; Questionnaires; Reporting; repository; Research; Research Design; Research Infrastructure; Risk; risk variant; Role; Saliva; sample collection; Sample Size; Sampling; screening; Selection Bias; Serum; sex; Smoking; social; Source; South Korea; Standardization; Symptoms; System; Testing; Time; Time trend; Toxic Environmental Substances; Toxin; Uncertainty; Vaccination; whole genome; ","The Roles of Environmental Risks and GEX in Increasing ASD Prevalence","021462","CPDD","Child Psychopathology and Developmental Disabilities Study Section ","","","08","291473","123299","414772",""

In our study, we found that our newly developed orally active glucose metabolism modulator HJC0152 significantly prevented/delayed mammary tumor formation in animal models for human ER-negative and triple-negative BCs by blocking premalignant lesions, via targeting aberrant glucose and energy metabolism. To provide the foundation and rationale to target glucose metabolism pathway as a new non-ER-based strategy for preventing BC and bring novel cancer-preventive drugs for human trials, we propose to characterize the preventive efficacy for HJC0152 in clinically relevant prevention settings, define the HJC0152-targeting molecules important in BC development, and charactrize and validate the identified high-confidence targets of HJC0152.","8781332; ","SHEN, QIANG ;","PERLOFF, MARJORIE","04/20/2018","03/31/2023","absorption; Address; Adult; Affinity; African American; Age; analog; Animal Model; Antineoplastic Agents; arginase; Aromatase Inhibitors; Automobile Driving; base; Binding; Biochemical; Biological Availability; Biotin; Blood; BRCA1 gene; BRCA1 Mutation; Breast; Breast Cancer Cell; Breast Cancer Prevention; Breast Cancer Prevention Trial; Breast Cancer survivor; Breast Carcinogenesis; cancer care; cancer subtypes; cancer therapy; carcinogenesis; Cell Line; Cell Proliferation; Cells; Chemoprevention; Chemopreventive Agent; Chronic; Clinical; clinical development; clinically relevant; Complex; Contralateral Breast; Crystallography; Development; Dose; drug candidate; energy balance; Energy Metabolism; Enzymes; ERBB2 gene; Estrogen Antagonists; Estrogen receptor negative; Estrogen receptor positive; Estrogen Receptors; Excretory function; experimental study; Fluorescein; Fostering; Foundations; Glucose; glucose metabolism; Goals; high risk population; Hispanics; Histologic; Human; Immune system; In Vitro; in vivo; Incidence; Intervention; Investigation; Investigational Drugs; Ipsilateral; Knowledge; Latina; Lesion; Ligands; loss of function; Malignant - descriptor; malignant breast neoplasm; Malignant Neoplasms; Mammary gland; Mammary Neoplasms; Mammary Tumorigenesis; Metabolic; Metabolism; Modeling; Molecular Probes; Monitor; Mouse Mammary Tumor Virus; mouse model; Mus; mutant; novel; Oral; Oral Administration; Organ; Outcome; Pathway interactions; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Pilot Projects; Polymers; pre-clinical; preclinical development; preclinical safety; Premalignant; prevent; Prevention; Preventive; Preventive therapy; Preventive treatment; Primary Prevention; Production; Receptor Signaling; Research; Resistance; restoration; Risk; Role; Safety; Selective Estrogen Receptor Modulators; Signal Transduction; Simian virus 40; small molecule; Solid; specific biomarkers; Specificity; STAT3 gene; Structure; Survivors; Technology; Testing; tool; Toxic effect; Transgenic Mice; triple-negative invasive breast carcinoma; tumor; Validation; Woman; Work; ","Chemoprevention of Breast Cancer by Targeting Glucose Metabolism with HJC0152","226001","CDP","Chemo/Dietary Prevention Study Section ","","","01","358067","120430","478497",""

Moreover, NT receptor signaling highly overlaps and counteracts many of the degenerative signaling patterns occurring in AD, therefore, strategies that augment receptor signaling will likely inhibit AD degenerative signaling thereby delaying the onset or slowing the progress of synapse and neuronal degeneration.","1889224; ","LONGO, FRANK M;","REFOLO, LORENZO","07/15/2017","03/31/2019","Affect; Aging; Alzheimer's Disease; Alzheimer's disease model; Amyloid; anxiety-like behavior; base; Binding; Bioavailable; Blood - brain barrier anatomy; Brain; Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor; California; Characteristics; Chemosensitization; cholinergic; Cognition; Cognitive deficits; combat; Complex; Data; Degenerative Disorder; Dendritic Spines; design; Development; Disease; Dose; drug development; drug discovery; effective therapy; efficacy testing; Functional disorder; Future; Grant; improved; improved functioning; In Vitro; in vivo; Inflammation; Investigation; Laboratories; Lead; Legal patent; Ligand Binding; Ligands; Link; Maintenance; Memory; Memory impairment; mouse model; Mus; Nerve Degeneration; Nerve Growth Factor Receptors; Nerve Growth Factors; nervous system disorder; Neurites; Neurodegenerative Disorders; neuronal survival; Neurons; neuropathology; neurotrophic factor; Neurotrophic Tyrosine Kinase Receptor Type 2; Neurotrophin 3; new therapeutic target; NGFR Protein; North Carolina; novel; novel therapeutics; Oral; Oral Administration; Parents; Pathogenesis; Pathologic; Pathology; Pattern; Penetration; Phase I Clinical Trials; Plasma; Population; prevent; Process; programs; Proteins; prototype; psychologic; Publishing; receptor; Receptor Activation; Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases; Receptor Signaling; Research; response; San Francisco; Signal Pathway; Signal Transduction; small molecule; Source; Synapses; synaptic function; tau Proteins; Techniques; Testing; Therapeutic; United States National Institutes of Health; Universities; Up-Regulation; Validation; Vertebral column; Work; ","Small molecule neurotrophin receptor ligands to treat Alzheimer's disease","053856","DDNS","Drug Discovery for the Nervous System Study Section ","","","02","125000","71250","196250",""

Standard culturing method for diagnosis of sepsis requires up to 48 hrs that is often too late for implementing an adequate antibiotic treatment, especially when trying to minimize unnecessary antibiotic treatments and/or impact the development of antibiotic resistant bacterial strains. Standard methods require a relatively large blood sample volumes causing significant iatrogenic blood losses in neonates, that limit the repetition of the sampling, that would improve the accuracy and prevent false positives due to bacterial contamination during sampling. This project brings a new DNA-based point-of-care method with ~15-20 minutes sample-to-answer time, offering very small sample volumes, as low as 5 - 200 microliters, compatible with the neonatal sepsis detection and a highly-multiplexed detection of both sepsis and antibiotic resistant pathogens in neonatal infections.

Factors unique to HIV disease that contribute to excess risk for non-AIDS conditions include ongoing immune activation and incomplete immune recovery (despite effective HIV treatment with viral suppression). This proposal is a randomized placebo-controlled trial to study the potential benefits of losartan for reducing non- AIDS disease risk, leveraging it's well-established anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic effects in HIV uninfected populations. We will determine if losartan reduces systemic inflammation (i.e., IL-6 levels) and improves immune recovery (i.e., CD4 count) among older HIV positive persons to a degree that is clinically relevant. An important pathologic consequence of ongoing immune activation is fibrosis in lymphatic tissues that impairs T- cell homeostasis and limits immune recovery. An important, and innovative, aspect of this study will be to test the hypothesis that limiting immune activation and fibrosis within lymphatic tissues will improve survival and propagation of naive T-cells thereby augmenting immune recovery. In summary, our proposal will test important mechanistic questions, and determine if losartan has meaningful positive effects on immune activation and immune recovery that will motivate subsequent clinical outcome trials.","8188921; ","BAKER, JASON V;","RADZISZEWSKA, BARBARA","04/01/2014","03/31/2020","Address; Age; Aging; Anti-Inflammatory Agents; Anti-Retroviral Agents; antiretroviral therapy; Automobile Driving; Biological Markers; Blood; Blood Pressure; body system; Cardiovascular Diseases; cardiovascular disorder risk; CD4 Lymphocyte Count; CD4 Positive T Lymphocytes; Cell Count; Clinical; clinical predictors; clinical risk; Clinical Trials; clinically relevant; Collagen; Connective Tissue Diseases; cytokine; Data; Deposition; Disease; disorder risk; effective therapy; epidemiologic data; epidemiology study; Event; experience; FCGR3B gene; Fibrosis; Frequencies; Funding; Goals; HIV; HIV Infections; HIV Seropositivity; Homeostasis; Immune; immune activation; immune function; Immunity; Immunologics; Immunophenotyping; immunoregulation; Impairment; improved; improved functioning; In Vitro; Inflammation; Inflammatory; innovation; Interleukin-1 beta; Interleukin-6; Intervention; Lead; Link; Losartan; lymph nodes; Lymphoid Tissue; Malignant Neoplasms; Measures; Mediating; Methods; Modeling; monocyte; Morbidity - disease rate; mortality; multidisciplinary; novel; older patient; Outcome; Pathogenesis; Pathologic; Pathology; Pathway interactions; Patients; peripheral blood; Persons; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Phenotype; Placebos; Plasma; Population; primary outcome; Production; Property; public health relevance; Randomized; randomized placebo controlled trial; Recovery; Renal Tissue; Research; Research Personnel; Reticular Cell; Risk; Risk Factors; RNA; Role; T-Lymphocyte; T-Lymphocyte Subsets; Testing; Tissues; TNF gene; Transforming Growth Factor beta; translational clinical trial; Translational trial; treatment effect; United States National Institutes of Health; Viral; Work; ","Treatment to reduce inflammation and improve immune recovery among older HIV pts","045032","ZRG1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","04","515926","26196","542122",""

In parallel studies, we identified a microRNA, miR-486, as being uniquely reduced in DMD human muscle biopsies.

We argue in this project that it is possible for vulnerable individuals to build up their emotional resilience, decrease their chronic anxiety and buffer their responses against psychosocial stress. We have discovered a molecule in the brain that naturally protects against anxiety and that is decreased in the brains of depressed humans. We have shown in our animal model of genetic vulnerability to anxiety that this same molecule is also low and that enhancing it shortly after birth can have lifelong protective effects against stress and anxiety responses. The current project studies the molecular mechanisms involved in the resilience induced by this natural brain factor.

Obesity, or fat tissue expansion, is associated with diseases including insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes, fatty liver disease, and cardiovascular disease. However, the concept of ?healthy? obesity has recently emerged. This has arisen from observations that many obese individuals are metabolically normal. Data has pointed to a role for the healthy function of adipose tissue in keeping individuals healthy even if they have relatively large mass of adipose tissue. These functions include being able to expand upon demand, being able to avoid inflammation, and continuing to produce hormones as normal, despite expansion. Expansion occurs through either generating more cells, or enlarging the existing fat cells so that they can store more fat. Studies suggest that expansion of cell size causes metabolic disease, and it is actually beneficial to generate more fat cells. We have discovered a new pathway that can be used to increase the number of fat cells, and we propose to study the mechanism for this.","10482440; ","COWART, LAUREN ASHLEY;","","04/01/2009","03/31/2021","Address; adipocyte differentiation; Adipocytes; adipokines; Adipose tissue; Agonist; animal tissue; Animals; base; bone; Cardiovascular Diseases; Cartilage; Cell Size; cell type; Cells; Chondrocytes; Chondrogenesis; Clinical; Coin; Cues; Data; Defect; Diabetes Mellitus; Diet; differential expression; Disease; Dyslipidemias; Endocrine; Endocrine Glands; Enzymes; Event; Exhibits; extracellular; Family; Fatty acid glycerol esters; Fatty Liver; Functional disorder; Funding; G-Protein-Coupled Receptors; General Population; Health; Hepatic; Homeostasis; Hormones; Hyperplasia; Hypertrophy; impaired glucose tolerance; Impairment; in vivo; Individual; Inflammation; Insulin; Insulin Resistance; Investigation; Leptin; Light; Link; lipid biosynthesis; Lipids; Liver diseases; Mesenchymal Differentiation; Mesenchymal Stem Cells; Metabolic; Metabolic Diseases; Metabolic syndrome; Metabolism; Modeling; mouse model; Mus; Muscle; non-alcoholic fatty liver disease; Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus; novel; Obesity; Obesity associated disease; Organ; Osteoblasts; Osteogenesis; Outcome; Pathway interactions; Peripheral; Phenotype; Physiological; Population; Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders; Posture; Prevalence; Process; Proliferating; receptor; recruit; Regenerative Medicine; Research; Research Support; response; Role; Scheme; Scientist; Side; Signal Pathway; Signal Repression; Signal Transduction; Signaling Molecule; Sphingolipids; sphingosine 1-phosphate; Sphingosine-1-Phosphate Receptor; SPHK1 enzyme; stem; stem cell differentiation; Stem cells; Stretching; subcutaneous; Testing; Tissue Expansion; tissue repair; Tissues; Up-Regulation; Veterans; Visceral; WNT Signaling Pathway; Work; ","Roles of Sphingolipids in the Pathophysiology of Obesity and Diabetes","000200","ENDA","Endocriniology A ","","","09","","","",""

The incidence of allergies worldwide is rising, yet treatment options remain limited. Allergen-reactive IgE antibodies play a central role in the majority of allergic responses, sensitizing mast cells and basophils to respond to allergens by binding to receptors on their surface. Anti-IgE antibody (Omalizumab) therapy has been developed to block this interaction between IgE and its receptors and is used to treat allergic asthma and chronic idiopathic urticaria. We have observed that engineered IgE variants, which can be used in combination with Omalizumab treatment, can also potently inhibit basophil activation, potentially through recruitment of other cell surface receptors that block allergen- specific signaling. In this proposal, we will investigate how the IgE antibody can be further engineered to enhance the suppression of basophil triggering and determine whether these novel inhibitors provide enhanced protection in animal models of the anaphylactic response.","1891687; ","JARDETZKY, THEODORE S;","NOEL, PATRICIA","04/15/2018","03/31/2022","Affect; Affinity; Allergens; Allergic; Allergic Disease; Allergic Reaction; allergic response; Anaphylaxis; Animal Model; Antibodies; base; Basophilic Cell; Basophils; Binding; carbohydrate structure; Carbohydrates; Cell Culture Techniques; Cell Line; Cell Surface Receptors; Cells; Chronic; Complex; dander; Data; design; Effector Cell; Engineering; Extrinsic asthma; Family; glycosylation; Human; Hypersensitivity; IgE; IgE Receptors; Immune system; Immunology; In Vitro; in vivo; Incidence; Inflammatory; Inflammatory Response; inhibitor/antagonist; insight; ITIM; Laboratories; Ligation; Link; Location; mast cell; Mediating; member; Modification; Molds; Molecular; Mus; mutant; novel; omalizumab; Pathway interactions; Patients; Play; Pollen; Polysaccharides; pyroglyphid; receptor; recruit; response; Role; Route; sialic acid binding Ig-like lectin; Signal Transduction; Site; structural biology; Structure; Surface; Testing; Therapeutic antibodies; Transgenic Mice; Urticaria; Variant; ","Suppression of basophil activation by IgE glycovariants","141493","ZRG1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","01","260000","82950","342950",""

Current treatments are based on immunosuppressive medications, which are unspecific and often toxic. As a result, patients can develop recurrent infections due to the generalized state of immunosuppression, which increases the risk of complications and mortality. Our studies will not only provide new insights into lupus etiopathogenesis but also identify new biomarkers for developing more specific therapies with fewer side effects than those of current therapies. Our results may also apply to other autoimmune diseases such as diabetes, in which O-glycosylation also plays an important role.

Prevention scientists have identified risk factors for drug use vulnerability among adolescent populations; however, such models have largely failed to explain risk for African Americans. Therefore, as noted by NIDA and others, culture-specific risk models are necessary to better understand vulnerability to drug use among African American youth. My long-term career goal is to establish myself as an externally funded expert in developmental risk for drug use and addiction among African Americans. The purpose of the K01 proposal is develop content and methodological expertise on cultural and physiological mechanisms that impact drug risk for African American youth. Thus, with training in these areas, the overall objective of this research project is to 1) examine inflammatory pathways through which discrimination impacts drug use vulnerability among African American youth, 2) protective variables that moderate risk, and 3) potential variations of risk based on assessment modality. The first two objective will be completed using Dr. Gene Brody?s SHAPE dataset, a longitudinal study of 500 African American youth aged 16-21 years. For the third objective, I will recruit 150 African American youth aged 16-18 years to examine inflammatory functioning and drug use vulnerability based on discrimination type and measurement modality across a 12-month period. Testing such models is significant, as it will clarify our understanding on the magnitude of the effect discrimination has on drug use risk among African American youth and specific pathways through which the risk pathway operates. Furthermore, such findings are significant as they will directly impact intervention programming by identifying specific targets within the risk process and important cultural factors to include that can buffer risk. In the final stages of this K01 award period, I will submit an R01 to NIDA to investigate the prospective effect multiple forms of chronic stress have on inflammation and negative affect among African American youth to determine critical periods to intervene within the risk process.","14131522; ","ZAPOLSKI, TAMIKA CHERE' BARKLEY;","GORDON, HAROLD","04/15/2018","03/31/2023","Address; Adolescent; Adolescent and Young Adult; African American; aged; Alcohols; Area; base; Behavior; biobehavior; Biological; Buffers; career; Childhood; Chronic; Chronic stress; critical period; Critical Thinking; Data; Data Set; Development; Discrimination; Distal; drug abuse prevention; Drug Addiction; drug discrimination; Drug usage; drug use vulnerability; emotional distress; Ethnic group; experience; Funding; Genes; Goals; Health; Impairment; improved; Inflammation; Inflammatory; inflammatory marker; Injury; innovation; Intervention; Life Cycle Stages; Longitudinal Studies; Marijuana; marijuana use; Measurement; Measures; Mediating; Mediation; Mediator of activation protein; Memory; Mental Depression; Mental Health; Mentored Research Scientist Development Award; Methodology; Methods; Modality; Modeling; National Institute of Drug Abuse; negative affect; negative mood; Outcome; Pathway interactions; Patient Self-Report; peer; Pharmaceutical Preparations; physical conditioning; Physiological; Population; Prevention; Process; prospective; protective effect; public health relevance; racial and ethnic; racial discrimination; racial identity; recruit; Reporting; Research; Research Project Grants; resilience; Risk; Risk Factors; Role; Scientist; social; Socialization; Stress; stressor; Testing; Training; Variant; Violence; Work; Youth; ","Racial discrimination and drug use: Examining the mediating role of inflammation among African American youth","043654","CIHB","Community Influences on Health Behavior Study Section ","","A1","01","131546","10524","142070",""

To date, the molecular mechanism underlying wear particle-induced bone loss in senescent people remains elusive. The proposed studies will investigate whether circulating osteoclast precursor cells can contribute to a particle-induced bone resorption via high mobility group protein B1/ macrophage migration inhibitory factor (HMGB1/MIF) axis.

It induces healthy metabolic adaptations and provides protection against heart disease, cancer, obesity, diabetes and dementia. However, many are either unwilling or unable to participate in regular exercise, due to illness, injury, advanced age, or other reasons. Furthermore, there is a great deal of individual variation in response to exercise. The genetic factors that cause this variability are not well understood. Here, we use the fruit fly model and its many powerful genetic tools to identify the essential genes that must be activated for exercise to have its effects. In doing so, we will come closer to identifying therapeutic targets for treatments to provide the benefits of exercise to those who are unable to complete an endurance training program.","6803161; ","WESSELLS, ROBERT JOHN;","WILLIAMS, JOHN","04/01/2017","03/31/2019","Adrenergic Agents; Adrenergic Receptor; Age; age related; Amines; Animals; Attenuated; Behavior; Biological Models; Cardiac; care burden; Chronic; Data; Dementia; Development; Devices; Diabetes Mellitus; Diagnostic; disability; Disease; Drosophila genus; Elderly; endurance exercise; Epidemic; Essential Genes; Exercise; exercise program; exercise regimen; exercise training; experience; experimental study; Fatty acid glycerol esters; Female; Feminization; fly; functional adaptation; Gene Expression; Genetic; Genetic Models; Goals; Health; Healthcare; Heart; Heart Diseases; Human; Impairment; improved; Incidence; Individual; Individual Differences; inducible gene expression; Injury; intervention cost; Knowledge; Light; Longevity; Longitudinal Studies; male; Malignant Neoplasms; Measures; Mediating; Mediator of activation protein; Metabolic; Modeling; Molecular; Motivation; Muscle; muscle metabolism; Neurons; Neuropeptides; new therapeutic target; Norepinephrine; novel; Obesity; Obesity associated disease; Octopamine; octopamine receptor; Patients; Pattern; Performance; Pharmacologic Substance; Physiological; Pliability; Population; Positioning Attribute; prevent; Preventive Medicine; Process; protective effect; Public Health; receptor; Research; response; Sample Size; Schedule; sedentary; sedentary lifestyle; sex; Signal Transduction; Skeletal Muscle; Speed; Testing; therapeutic target; Time; Tissues; tool; Training; Training Programs; transcriptome; Treatment Cost; Variant; Work; ","Octopamine Mediates Benefits Of Endurance Exercise In Drosophila","055712","SMEP","Skeletal Muscle Biology and Exercise Physiology Study Section ","","","02","125000","67500","192500",""

Intriguingly, the ability of recombinant HRS to activate Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and associated MyD88-dependent signaling cascades suggests that our models of HRS-induced myositis may provide a more general framework for understanding subtypes of muscular dystrophy as well as other inflammatory muscle diseases involving downstream activation of the key transcription factor NF-?B (including those disorders associated with sepsis, trauma, and/or ischemia). Therefore, as a prelude to the development of novel therapeutic agents for autoimmune as well as non-autoimmune muscle inflammation, this proposal will define the relationship between immune dysregulation, aberrant NF-?B-mediated molecular signaling cascades, and muscle dysfunction in HRS-induced myositis.","7169663; ","ASCHERMAN, DANA P;","MANCINI, MARIE","04/10/2017","03/31/2022","adaptive immune response; Adverse effects; Antigens; Assessment tool; Autoantigens; Autoimmune Process; Autoimmunity; B-Lymphocytes; base; Binding; Biochemical; Biological Assay; Biopsy Specimen; Cell Death; cell motility; Cell physiology; Cells; comparative trial; Complex; cytokine; Development; Disease; Fatty acid glycerol esters; Foundations; Functional disorder; Functional Imaging; General Population; Genetic Transcription; Hand Strength; Histidine-tRNA Ligase; Histologic; Human; human disease; Idiopathic Inflammatory Myopathies; Immune; immune activation; Immune signaling; Immune Targeting; Immunization; Immunize; Impairment; In Vitro; in vivo; Infiltration; Inflammation; Inflammatory; Injury; Innate Immune Response; insight; Interleukin-1; Intramuscular; Ischemia; Knock-out; Knockout Mice; Laboratories; Link; Luciferases; Lymphocyte; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Mediating; Modeling; Molecular; Morbidity - disease rate; mortality; Mus; Muscle; Muscle Cells; muscle degeneration; Muscle Weakness; Muscular Dystrophies; Myoblasts; myogenesis; Myopathy; Myositis; Natural Immunity; novel therapeutics; Organ; Pathogenesis; Pathogenicity; Pathologic; Pathology; Pathway interactions; Peptides; Phenotype; Play; prevent; Process; Production; Proteins; Receptor Signaling; receptor-mediated signaling; Recombinants; recruit; regenerative; Role; Secondary to; Sepsis; Series; Signal Pathway; Signal Transduction; System; systemic autoimmune disease; T-Cell Activation; T-Cell Receptor; T-Lymphocyte; targeted treatment; Therapeutic; Therapeutic Agents; Therapeutic immunosuppression; therapeutic target; Tissues; TLR2 gene; TLR4 gene; TNF gene; Toll-like receptors; tool; trafficking; transcription factor; Transgenic Mice; Trauma; Treatment Efficacy; Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor; Vascular Endothelium; Work; ","Innate Immune Activation in Autoimmune Myopathy","071369","ACTS","Arthritis, Connective Tissue and Skin Study Section ","","","02","285799","70729","356528",""

The impact of this devastating disease will increase enormously as the world population continues to age. The mechanisms that contribute to post-ischemic injury and neurological dysfunction after stroke are not completely understood, and most clinical trials conducted to save neuronal function to date for stroke therapeutics have failed. Failure to consider white matter (WM) injury is a critical gap in the development of successful stroke therapy. An ideal stroke therapeutic must not only be directed towards neuronal and axonal protection across age, but also must restore function when applied after injury. Post-ischemic application of the Class I HDAC inhibitor MS-275 protects neurons, axons, and glial cells and restores function in young and aging brain by preserving mitochondria. Therefore we will determine the mechanisms of post-ischemic protection conferred by Class I HDAC inhibition in young and aging WM. The overall goal of this project is to test if Class I HDAC inhibition can be used to develop novel therapies to help aid recovery after stroke.","8597405; ","BALTAN, SELVA ;","MACKIEWICZ, MIROSLAW","09/01/2010","03/31/2022","Achievement; Affect; Age; age related; Aging; aging brain; Attenuated; Axon; base; Biochemical; Brain; cancer clinical trial; Cause of Death; cell injury; cell motility; Cell physiology; Cells; Conduct Clinical Trials; deprivation; design; Development; disability; Disease; Electrophysiology (science); Epigenetic Process; excitotoxicity; experience; experimental study; Failure; functional restoration; Funding; Gene Proteins; Genetic; Genetic Transcription; Glucose; Goals; gray matter; Health; Histone Deacetylase; Histone Deacetylase Inhibitor; Impairment; In Vitro; in vivo; Injury; insight; Ischemia; Light; Mediating; Membrane Potentials; MicroRNAs; Mitochondria; mitochondrial dysfunction; Molecular; mouse model; MS-275; Mus; Neuroglia; Neurologic Dysfunctions; neuronal survival; Neurons; Nitric Oxide Synthase; novel; novel therapeutics; Oxidative Stress; Oxygen; Pathogenesis; Patients; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Phase III Clinical Trials; Physiological; Population; prevent; promoter; Protein Acetylation; Protein Isoforms; Recovery; Recovery of Function; recruit; Regulation; Regulator Genes; Research; Risk; Role; stroke; stroke therapy; Structure; Testing; Therapeutic; Therapeutic Intervention; Treatment Efficacy; United States; white matter; white matter injury; ","Vulnerability of Aging White Matter to Ischemia","033720","NOMD","Neural Oxidative Metabolism and Death Study Section ","","","08","205000","123000","1",""

Since Hispanic and Native Americans are genetically predisposed to develop NAFL as a result of polymorphisms in the PNPLA3 gene, we propose to investigate the contribution of reactive oxygen species towards promoting TASH when the PNPLA3 gene with human polymorphic alleles are combined in mice expressing the inducible human CYP2E1 gene. The contribution of intestinal microbiota on increased susceptibility of toxicants generating TASH will be pursued, and the mechanisms of these responses will be examined in ?human livers in the dish?

In recent years, platelet rich plasma (PRP) injections have gained increasing attention for improving pain and function in patients with knee OA. Basic science studies also suggest that PRP may also potentially stimulate repair responses to articular cartilage. However, the mechanisms of action of PRP in the treatment of knee OA are unknown. Because autologous blood is used, the PRP composition differs between patients. It is also unknown whether these differences in PRP composition affect clinical outcomes.

Statement of Public Health Relevance -- 1 DP1 AR068147-01  The problem of musculoskeletal tissue destruction, loss and wear has major societal implications. For example in the area of musculoskeletal joints, there are over 1 million total joint arthroplasty surgeries performed in the United States each year, with a rate of growth of 6% per year projected. Developing a new therapeutic strategy for the regeneration of complex musculoskeletal tissues and joints is proposed in this application. The work will revolutionize the way musculoskeletal tissue injury and wear is treated, tremendously improving the quality of lives of patients.

PE can lead to premature deliveries, large medical costs, and even death. People that develop PE have decreased levels of the phosphate transporters Slc20a1 and Slc20a2 in their placenta, and I have found that mice that lack Slc20a1 or Slc20a2 display poor blood vessel development, signs of PE, and placental calcification (deposition of phosphate-containing minerals). The long-term goal of this research project is to improve our understanding of PE by determining how loss of Slc20a1 and Slc20a2 could lead to placental dysfunction, and how placental calcification impacts placental function.

Project-001: Engineering stem and effector cells towards a functional HIV-1 cure     Project Leader (PL): Derrick J. Rossi          DESCRIPTION (as provided by applicant): The functional cure of the 'Berlin Patient' through transplantation of allogeneic CCR5?32 stem cells advocates for using gene-altered stem cells to confer lifetime protection against HIV-1 re-infection. Large-scale adoption of allogeneic transplantation of CCR5?32 stem cells is not possible however. The barriers to stem cell transplantation as a therapeutic option for HIV will be significantly lowered if gene-editing platforms could be used to safely and efficiently generate patient-specific CCR5 null CD34+ HSCs for autologous transplantation. At the same time, it is also clear that eradication of HIV reserves will be an important part of an effective and durable HIV cure. In this multidisciplinary proposal we will apply several cutting edge technologies including modified-mRNA and CRISPR/Cas9 gene-editing platforms to engineer CD34+ hematopoietic stem cells and CD8+ T-cells towards the goals generating HIV-resistant immune systems, and eradicating viral reserves.","1861205; ","SCADDEN, DAVID T;","THOMAS, JOHN","04/01/2015","03/31/2020","Ablation; Adoption; Advocate; AIDS/HIV problem; Alleles; American; Animals; Antibodies; antiretroviral therapy; Antiviral Agents; Area; authority; Autologous; Autologous Transplantation; base; Berlin; Biometry; Blood; CCR5 gene; CD34 gene; CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes; Cell Communication; cell type; Cells; Clinical; clinical development; Clinical Trials; Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats; cohort; Complex; conditioning; cost; CRISPR/Cas technology; Data; design; Development; Effector Cell; Engineering; Engraftment; European; experience; fetal; gene transplantation for gene therapy; Gene-Modified; Genes; Genetic; genetically modified cells; genome editing; Goals; Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation; Hematopoietic stem cells; HIV; HIV Infections; HIV resistance; HIV-1; Homing; Homologous Transplantation; Human; humanized mouse; Immune system; in vivo; Infection; Laboratories; Liver; Lymphopoiesis; Maps; Measures; meetings; Messenger RNA; Methodology; Modification; Morbidity - disease rate; mouse model; multidisciplinary; Mus; Mutation; novel; novel strategies; Patients; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Pharmacology; pre-clinical; preclinical development; Preparation; Procedures; Protocols documentation; public health relevance; Research Personnel; Research Project Grants; Resistance; Safety; Services; SLEB2 gene; stem cell niche; Stem cell transplant; Stem cells; success; synergism; System; Technology; Testing; Therapeutic; Thymus Gland; Time; Toxic effect; Transplantation; Viral; Viral reservoir; ","A defend and destroy approach to curing HIV","129903","ZAI1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","04","2069291","224891","2294182",""

We will use a combination of synapse morphology, receptor biology, and electrophysiology to show that changes to synaptic integrity and neural networks can predict behavioral outcomes in mice. We will also adapt a novel functional MRI (fMRI) analysis technique called Hcorr for TBI research. Hcorr is a local regional heterogeneity analysis that use fMRI activation patterns to infer neuronal selectivity, which may have the potential to serve as an indirect measure of synaptic function.  Synaptic changes have been extensively reported after experimental TBI, with synapse loss occurring in multiple different animal models of mild, moderate and severe TBI including controlled cortical impact (CCI) and fluid percussion injury (FPI), and mild closed head impact. Thus the loss of synapses appears to be a common event, regardless of injury type and injury severity. Despite this common pathophysiology, there are clear differences between injury models in regard to acute and chronic synaptic integrity. We have selected an assessment battery consisting of validated techniques to measure synapse integrity, biology, and function. We will use regression analysis to determine the techniques with the best predictive validity for cognitive function after TBI, and assess if Hcorr can be used to predict these outcomes from non-invasive fMRI scans.  We will examine synaptic responses in three different TBI paradigms: 1) a single mild TBI that presents with transient synapse loss, no axonal injury, and no cognitive impairments; 2) repeat mTBI (30 mTBI) that presents with functional synapse changes including altered brainwave patterns, impaired hippocampal long term potentiation (LTP), and chronic behavioral deficits in learning and memory; 3) CCI that presents with widespread synapse loss, neuronal cell death, inflammation, and traumatic axonal injury. For each injury paradigm and their respective controls we will study acute (1d and 7d) and chronic (1m and 3m) timepoints to determine the continuum of synapse responses to each type of injury.  We have established a multidisciplinary team based in the Washington DC area that will work independently using a blind study design, to study synaptic changes and recovery after TBI. The TBI injuries will occur in the Burns Lab (Georgetown). Synaptic counts, morphology, and architecture will be studied in the Dickstein Lab (USUHS). Behavior, synaptic biochemistry and molecular biology will be conducted in the Burns Lab (Georgetown). Electrophysiology will be conducted in the Wu Lab (Georgetown). MRI will be conducted in the Dardzinski Lab (USUHS), and Hcorr analysis by the Jiang Lab (Georgetown).  Internal and external assessments on whether go/no-go targets have been achieved will be made according to the TOP-NT guidelines.

The full complement of these genes constitutes the organism's genome. Furthermore the genome of each individual within a species varies slightly, thus providing the genetic basis of the many differences we see between individuals. The technology of DNA sequencing has allowed scientists to construct the shared genome sequence of humans and many species of plant and animal, providing powerful evidence for the evolutionary connections between species. Effort is now going into decoding the genetic differences between individuals within a species, particularly for individual humans and their susceptibility to disease. Many of these advances rely upon interactions between a diverse set of experts, ranging from engineers developing ever faster sequencing technologies, bioinformatics experts who handle the very large datasets generated by these machines, biologists who interpret the results in the context of known biology to shed new light on fundamental mechanisms, and medical experts who seek to apply this information to improved medical treatment and the development of novel therapeutic strategies. This annual conference is one of the major points of exchange for many scientists, editors and associated genome experts to share their latest findings, and provides rapid peer-to-peer communication and networking that is essential to drive the field forward.

Elderly individuals >60 years of age are at especially high risk for developing severe, often life-threatening disease produced by virus reactivation. These diseases include zoster, postherpetic neuralgia, multiple ocular disorders and vasculopathies presenting as stroke, aneurysm, giant cell arteritis and granulomatous aortitis. Alphaherpesvirus reactivation also causes burning mouth syndrome, i.e., severe, debilitating intraoral pain that affects up to 18% of postmenopausal women. Alphaherpesvirus reactivation is also associated with Alzheimer's disease and cognitive impairment in the elderly. To facilitate advances towards eliminating disease caused by alphaherpesvirus reactivation, the Colorado Alphaherpesvirus Latency Society (CALS) was formed to: (1) provide highly focused discussions of unpublished data on all aspects of alphaherpesvirus latency and diseases they cause on reactivation; (2) initiate/extend collaborative research, including exchange of unique reagents; and (3) foster the mentorship of student, postdoctoral and early-stage investigators. Since its inception, CALS has been instrumental in accelerating research in the field, including early detection and treatment of disease in the elderly cause by alphaherpesvirus reactivation, molecular pathways of disease as well as the host immune response, and new ideas in therapeutic and vaccine development. During the past funding period, CALS extended its scope to include dedicated time for in-depth student/postdoctoral fellows/early-stage investigator mentorship by providing written critiques of their presentations. CALS is aware of the increasing difficulty to succeed in academic sciences and has initiated a grant- writing clinic hosted by a volunteer team of established investigators experienced with NIH study sections. CALS is also aware of underrepresented minorities in science and has embarked on an effort to draw this important group into the field through early identification and mentorship.","11663751; ","COHRS, RANDALL J;","MACKIEWICZ, MIROSLAW","04/15/2014","03/31/2020","Academia; Address; Affect; Age; Age-Years; Alzheimer's Disease; Aneurysm; Antiviral Agents; Aortitis; Area; Award; Awareness; Basic Science; Burning Mouth Syndrome; Caliber; career; Chickenpox; Child; Clinic; Clinical Research; Collaborations; Colorado; Critiques; Data; Day Care; design; Disease; Disease Pathway; Early Diagnosis; Early identification; Early treatment; Education; Elderly; Encephalitis; Ensure; Epidemiology; experience; Fees; Fostering; Funding; Future; Goals; Government; graduate student; Grant; Granulomatous; Headache; Herpes zoster disease; Herpesvirus Type 3; high risk; Immune response; Immunologics; Impaired cognition; Incontinence; Individual; Industry; Infant; innovation; insight; Keratitis; Laboratory Research; Life; Mechanics; meetings; member; Mentorship; Molecular; Neurosciences; next generation; novel vaccines; Oral; Oral cavity; Pain; Paralysed; Philosophy; Population; Positioning Attribute; Postdoctoral Fellow; posters; Postherpetic neuralgia; Postmenopause; Published Comment; reactivation from latency; Reagent; Research; Research Personnel; Science; Scientist; senior faculty; Senior Scientist; Severities; Simplexvirus; skills; Societies; stroke; Students; Study Section; success; Suicide; symposium; Taxes; Temporal Arteritis; therapeutic development; Therapeutic Intervention; Time; Training; Travel; Underrepresented Minority; underrepresented minority student; United States National Institutes of Health; vaccine development; Vascular Diseases; Vasculitis; virology; Virus; Vocational Guidance; volunteer; Woman; Work; Writing; ","Annual Symposium of the Colorado Alphaherpesvirus Latency Society","046051","NIA","Neuroscience of Aging Review Committee ","","","05","45000","","45000",""

This study will reveal the mechanism by which leptin signals nutritional status to pituitary gonadotropes thus permitting normal fertility if the nutritional status is adequate. The project is innovative because its use of selective gene knockout models will allow discovery of the role of important post-transcriptional regulatory factors, including the Musashi RNA-binding protein and non-coding miRNAs in the regulation of gonadotrope function.

The reason why some individuals develop progressive disease and others have stable or inactive disease is not well understood. Sarcoidosis in an immune related disease and recent discoveries have identified novel immune cells in sarcoidosis. How these immune cells cause worsening disease in sarcoidosis over time is unknown. This proposal will define the role of these immune cells in sarcoidosis and how these cells might function to cause the inflammation in the lungs. A better understanding of the role of these novel cells and the pathways that control them will enable us to modulate the immune system towards disease resolution and potentially identify markers of progressive vs non-progressive disease.","9016545; 6478605; 10432614; 6917048 (contact); ","HAMZEH, NABEEL ; KOTH, LAURA L; LEACH, SONIA ; O'CONNOR, BRIAN P (contact);","VUGA, LOUIS JUSTINE","04/15/2018","02/28/2022","Address; advanced disease; Affect; Anti-Inflammatory Agents; Bioinformatics; Biometry; Biostatistical Methods; Blood; Blood specimen; Bronchoalveolar Lavage; Bronchoscopy; California; CD4 Positive T Lymphocytes; Cell Lineage; Cells; Characteristics; Clinical; clinical phenotype; clinical predictors; cohort; computerized tools; Coupling; Data; Data Set; Diagnosis; differential expression; Disease; Disease Outcome; Disease Progression; Disease remission; Effector Cell; Enrollment; Etiology; Flow Cytometry; follow-up; follower of religion Jewish; Frequencies; Future; Gene Expression; Gene Expression Profile; Genes; Genetic Transcription; genome-wide; genomic data; Genomics; Goals; Granulomatous; Health; Immune; Immune response; Immune system; Immunophenotyping; Individual; Inflammation; Irrigation; longitudinal analysis; Longitudinal Studies; Lung; Mediator of activation protein; Molecular; Morbidity - disease rate; mortality; Newly Diagnosed; novel; Organ; Outcome; outcome prediction; Pathogenesis; Pathogenicity; Pathway interactions; Patient-Focused Outcomes; Patients; Pattern; Phenotype; Physiology; Population; predict clinical outcome; Prevalence; Production; Progressive Disease; prospective; Prospective Studies; public health relevance; Pulmonary Sarcoidosis; Rare Diseases; recruit; Regulatory T-Lymphocyte; Research Design; Resolution; Resources; response; Role; Sampling; San Francisco; Sarcoidosis; Source; Stable Disease; T-Lymphocyte; Technology; Testing; Th1 Cells; Therapeutic Studies; Therapeutic Trials; Thoracic Radiography; Time; tool; transcriptome; transcriptome sequencing; transcriptomics; Underserved Population; Universities; ","A Prospective Study of T cell Immune-phenotype and Disease Outcome in Pulmonary Sarcoidosis","136681","IRAP","Infectious Diseases, Reproductive Health, Asthma and Pulmonary Conditions Study Section ","","A1","01","832662","217264","1049926",""

Furthermore, results may also aid in devising strategies to protect the SSC pool from detrimental effects of chemotherapy and radiation therapy that often eliminate the germline of male cancer patients, resulting in infertility.

Therefore, we propose to develop baseline operational neuropathological, criteria to diagnose this disorder and define its relationship with other well-known neurodegenerative diseases such as AD and related disorders. In addition we will examine the potential mechanistic basis of TBI induced neurodegeneration by examining the temporal course and potential contribution of inflammatory changes following TBI cases.

The trial is intended to evaluate the ability of the investigational amyloid antibody therapy crenezumab to slow down the decline in memory and thinking performance associated with AD, do so in a way that might lead to regulatory agencies to approve the treatment, provide a better test of the amyloid hypothesis, clarify the treatment's effects on the best established biological measurements of AD, set the stage to rapidly evaluate the range of promising prevention therapies, and help find ones that work as soon as possible.

Our collaborative group (called B-SNIP) developed a psychosis classification scheme (which we called Biotypes) using biological measures that are superior to DSM diagnoses for capturing neurobiological similarities and differences. In this project, we will broaden and extend this work to refine the neurobiological Biotype definitions, characterize unique molecular and genetic features of Biotypes, and test various classifications using multivariate approaches, which will be an important step toward personalized medicine for psychiatry.","1862786; ","PEARLSON, GODFREY D;","RUMSEY, JUDITH M","07/01/2006","03/31/2020","Address; Area; base; Biologic Characteristic; Biological; Biological Markers; biomarker panel; Bipolar Disorder; Blood; Brain; Brain imaging; case control; Categories; Characteristics; Classification; Classification Scheme; Clinical; clinical phenotype; Cognitive; Complex; Data; Databases; Diagnosis; Diagnostic; Diagnostic Specificity; Dimensions; Disease; DSM-IV; Electrophysiology (science); Etiology; Genetic; genetic analysis; Goals; healthy volunteer; Heritability; Heterogeneity; Image; Institutes; Laboratories; Measures; Medicine; Molecular Genetics; Multivariate Analysis; Names; neurobiological mechanism; Neurobiology; Neurologic Symptoms; novel; oculomotor; Outcome; Participant; personalized medicine; phenomenological models; Phenotype; phenotypic biomarker; Physiological; Positioning Attribute; proband; Procedures; Psychiatric Diagnosis; Psychiatry; Psychophysiology; psychosocial; Psychotic Disorders; public health relevance; recruit; relating to nervous system; Sampling; Schizoaffective Disorders; Schizophrenia; Site; social; Specific qualifier value; Structure; Subgroup; Symptoms; System; Taxon; Taxonomy; Testing; volunteer; Work; ","3/5 Bipolar-Schizophrenia Network for Intermediate Phenotypes 2 (BSNIP-2)","077945","ZMH1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","08","761064","66638","827702",""
