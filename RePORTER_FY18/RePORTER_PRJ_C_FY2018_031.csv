The 2018 BSS will be focused on the problems (genetic, genomic, psychosocial) of male Infertility and disorders of sexual development; the first session will highlight the molecular and mechanistic advances and improved diagnosis that comes from translational research on congenital genitourinary birth defects, as well as the challenges that intersexuality raises for not only the patients and their families but also the physicians involved in their care; while the second session on male infertility addresses key areas of concern for scientists, urologists and their patients, namely advances in personalized medicine and its application to an improved understanding of the molecular defects causing spermatogenic failure, sperm anomalies and paternally mediated effects on the offspring. This symposium will have a major impact by taking advantage of the largest gathering of urologists and urology researchers in the world to convey important research advancements and bring young investigators into this essential yet understudied field.","12281735; ","BEST, CAROLYN JOY MORRIS;","TAYMANS, SUSAN","04/27/2018","04/26/2019","Address; Aging; American; Area; Australia; Award; Basic Science; Benign; California; career; career development; Caring; Child; Clinical; clinical practice; college; Communities; Congenital Abnormality; Cryptorchidism; Defect; Diagnosis; Discipline; Disease; Doctor of Philosophy; Endocrine Disruptors; Etiology; Exhibits; Failure; Family; Fathers; Florida; Fostering; Future; gene environment interaction; General Hospitals; Genetic; genetic sex determination; Genitourinary system; Genomics; graduate student; Grant; Health Personnel; Health Sciences; Health system; Healthcare; Hermaphroditism; Hour; Hypospadias; improved; Individual; Infant Mortality; Infertility; insight; interest; Lead; Learning; Los Angeles; Male Infertility; Massachusetts; Mediating; Medical center; medical schools; Medicine; meetings; Meiosis; Molecular; next generation; offspring; Participant; Patients; Pediatric Hospitals; personalized medicine; Philadelphia; Physicians; posters; Pregnancy loss; Principal Investigator; programs; psychosocial; public health relevance; Request for Applications; Research; Research Personnel; Role; San Francisco; Scientist; Series; sex development disorder; Sexual Development; sperm cell; symposium; Syndrome; Texas; Translational Research; Travel; Universities; urinary; urologic; Urologist; Urology; Veterinary Medicine; Work; ","2018 AUA BASIC SCIENCES SYMPOSIUM: UNDERSTANDING INFERTILITY AND DISORDERS AND DIFFERENCES IN SEXUAL DEVELOPMENT","095658","CHHD","Biobehavioral and Behavioral Sciences Subcommittee ","","","01","8000","0","8000",""

Drugs that block the production of such metabolites have potential to be valuable therapeutic agents to slow or halt the development and progression of AMD. The goals of this proposal are to elucidate pathways involved in vitamin A metabolism and to develop pharmacological agents that can selectively modulate their function to achieve improved efficacy and tolerability.

Through statistical analyses of the records of Medicare beneficiaries; site visits and interviews at hospitals with high, low, and improving rates of patient participation; and a national survey of hospital practices, we will identify opportunities to improve quality of care and reduce disparities, and we will discover effective strategies for increasing rates of participation in PR programs.","9822603; ","LINDENAUER, PETER KYLE;","PUNTURIERI, ANTONELLO","06/01/2017","03/31/2021","Activities of Daily Living; Acute; Admission activity; Affect; base; behavior change; beneficiary; Cardiac rehabilitation; Case Mixes; Cause of Death; Chronic; Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease; Clinical; clinical practice; Clinical Practice Guideline; Comorbidity; contextual factors; Data; deconditioning; design; disparity reduction; Education; Enrollment; Ensure; evidence base; exercise capacity; exercise program; exercise training; experience; Fee-for-Service Plans; Foundations; functional status; Future; geographic difference; Goals; Guidelines; health care disparity; health related quality of life; Health system; Healthcare; high risk; Hospitalization; Hospitals; implementation science; implementation trial; improved; Individual; informant; innovation; Inpatients; insight; Institution; Insurance Coverage; interest; Intervention; Intervention Studies; Interview; Knowledge; Link; Low income; Lung diseases; Medical; Medicare; Meta-Analysis; Methods; Modeling; National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute; novel; Outpatients; patient oriented; Patient Participation; Patient Participation Rates; Patient Readmission; Patient-Focused Outcomes; Patients; payment; Performance; Phase; Policies; policy implication; prevent; programs; Psychosocial Assessment and Care; Public Health; pulmonary rehabilitation; Qualitative Methods; Quality of Care; Quality of life; randomized trial; readmission risk; Records; reduce symptoms; rehabilitation service; Reporting; Research; Risk; Sampling; screening; Series; Severity of illness; Site; Site Visit; Source; Standardization; Statistical Data Interpretation; Strategic Planning; Structure; Survey Methodology; Surveys; Testing; Time; Training and Education; Translational Research; Translations; uptake; Variant; Visit; Well in self; ","A mixed methods study to analyze the use of pulmonary rehabilitation following hospitalization for COPD, and to identify effective strategies for increasing rates of participation","133046","HSOD","Health Services Organization and Delivery Study Section ","","","02","486946","213387","700333",""

These diseases always appear sporadically and are never passed from affected parents to their children; nor do the parents of affected children show any signs of the disease. Importantly these disorders cause significant medical problems. We developed an approach for finding causal mutations in patients with these diseases, and we showed the approach works by identifying the cause of some these diseases, including CLOVES syndrome. We now want to extend our approach to identify the causes of other diseases and we want to learn more about how the mutations we identified in patients with CLOVES syndrome cause disease, so we can discover better ways to treat these individuals. Our goals are to help patients whose diseases were previously impenetrable to genetic analyses.","1877728; ","WARMAN, MATTHEW L;","CHEN, FAYE H","04/03/2014","03/31/2019","Ablation; Adult; Affect; Alleles; alternative treatment; Animal Model; Animals; Archives; Bar Codes; Benign; Biology; Biopsy; Bone Cysts; bone loss; Bone neoplasms; Caring; cDNA Library; Cells; Child; Chondroblastoma; Chondromyxoid Fibroma; Clinical Trials; cohort; Complex; Computational algorithm; Defect; Development; Diagnosis; Disease; Disease Progression; DNA; DNA Library; DNA sequencing; embryonic stem cell; Enterobacteria phage P1 Cre recombinase; Evaluation; exome; experimental study; Face; Finding by Cause; Formalin; Freezing; Genes; Genetic; genetic analysis; Genetic Counseling; Giant Cell Tumors; Glean; Goals; Gorham-Stout disease; Hereditary Disease; Human; Individual; inhibitor/antagonist; insight; Intervention; Klippel-Trenaunay-Weber Syndrome; Knock-in; Learning; Lesion; Link; Lipomatosis; Lymphatic; malformation; Malignant - descriptor; Massive Parallel Sequencing; Mediating; Medical; Megalencephaly; Morbidity - disease rate; Mosaicism; Mus; mutant; Mutate; Mutation; novel; Operative Surgical Procedures; osteosarcoma; Other Genetics; Paraffin Embedding; Parents; Pathogenesis; Pathologic; Pathologist; Patients; Pattern; Persons; Phenotype; PIK3CA gene; prevent; Primary Health Care; Process; prospective; public health relevance; Reporter; reproductive; Research; Research Personnel; RNA; Role; sample collection; Sampling; Sensitivity and Specificity; skeletal disorder; Skeletal system; Skeleton; Skin; Somatic Mutation; success; Surgeon; Syndrome; Tamoxifen; Therapeutic; Tissue Sample; Tissues; tool; transcriptome; transcriptome sequencing; treatment strategy; Work; ","Non-heritable genetic diseases of the skeletal system: Pathogenesis and Treatment","064231","GHD","Genetics of Health and Disease Study Section ","","","05","220000","169400","389400",""

Despite this lack, more than half of donor hearts available for transplantation are not utilized. For example, progression of ischemic cardiac damage after explantation limits use of donor hearts from geographical areas far from recipients, due to the time required for transportation. We have shown that adipose stem / stromal cells (ASC), which are readily available and cultured, markedly ameliorate ischemia and inflammation in multiple organs, including the heart; that these effects are mediated by paracrine factors and lead to major changes in circadian and mitochondrial gene transcription. We will optimize the ability of ASC-derived conditioned medium to improve cardiac preservation, and obtain novel insight into the molecular mechanisms by which this is effective, thus expanding the donor pool to the hearts obtained from donors at long distances.","1865058; ","MARCH, KEITH LEONARD;","","04/01/2017","03/31/2021","Accounting; Acute; Adipose tissue; Adult; Aftercare; angiogenesis; Apoptosis; ARNTL gene; Biogenesis; Biological Preservation; Blood Circulation; Blood flow; Cardiac; Cardiac Myocytes; Cells; cellular targeting; Cessation of life; circadian pacemaker; Circadian Rhythms; Conditioned Culture Media; Cultured Cells; curative treatments; Data; Dependence; Dependency; Deterioration; Dimensions; Disease; Dose; Endothelial Cells; Excision; exosome; experimental study; Fingerprint; Gene Expression; Genes; Genetic Transcription; Geographic Locations; Geography; graft function; Growth Factor; Heart; heart allograft; Heart failure; heart function; heart preservation; Heart Transplantation; Human; Hypoxia; improved; In Situ; In Vitro; Individual; induced pluripotent stem cell; Inflammation; Inflammatory; Infusion procedures; Injury; insight; Ischemia; Lead; Life; loss of function; Mediating; Mesenchymal; Mesenchymal Stem Cells; Mitochondria; Modality; Modeling; Molecular; Mus; Myocardial; Myocardial Infarction; Myocardial Ischemia; Myocardium; novel; Organ; Organ Donor; Organ Model; Organ Procurements; overexpression; paracrine; Pathologic; Patients; Pattern; Perfusion; Permeability; Preparation; Prevention; protective effect; Recovery; Recovery of Function; Reperfusion Injury; Reperfusion Therapy; Reporting; Rodent; Role; Savings; Site; Source; stem; Stem cells; Stromal Cells; System; Testing; Therapeutic; Therapeutic Effect; Time; transcriptome; transcriptome sequencing; Transplantation; Transportation; treatment effect; Veterans; ","Functional and Mechanistic Analysis of Mesenchymal Stem Cell Secretome to Ameliorate Ischemic Damage of Rodent Hearts in situ and Human Myocardium-on-a-Chip","003888","CARA","Cardiovascular Studies A ","","","02","","","",""

Imbalance is a major risk factor for falls, the incidence of falls increases with age, and falls hae been identified as a leading cause of death in older individuals. This is relevant to Veterans because the Veteran population is aging (as of 2011, 45% of male Veterans were over the age of 65 years). Additionally, other conditions that disproportionally affect Veterans, such as traumatic brain injury, also impact balance control and can leave affected Veterans more vulnerable to falls. The results from this project can contribute to improved clinical tests of balance function by developing methods that identify specific deficits in sensory and motor control mechanisms, to improved methods for rehabilitation of gait disorders by targeting therapy to address deficits identified by advanced methods for balance testing, and to the development of a novel intervention to improve balance during gait.","1905951; ","PETERKA, ROBERT J;","","04/01/2016","09/30/2020","Address; Affect; Age; age group; age related; Aging; Ankle; Anterior; balance prosthesis; balance testing; base; Body measure procedure; Body Patterning; Cause of Death; Characteristics; Clinical; clinical development; Cues; Custom; Data; Data Analyses; Databases; design; Development; Devices; Elderly; Environment; Equilibrium; experimental study; falls; Future; Gait; Gait abnormality; gait rehabilitation; Generations; Goals; Health; Health Care Costs; human old age (65+); improved; Incidence; Individual; instrument; Intervention; Knowledge; Lateral; Lead; Leg; male; mathematical model; Measurement; Measures; Medial; Methods; Modeling; Morbidity - disease rate; mortality; Motion; Motor; motor control; Movement; multisensory; neuroregulation; novel; Outcome Measure; Participant; Pattern; Physiological; Population; Posture; Prosthesis; Protocols documentation; prototype; public health relevance; Questionnaires; recruit; Regulation; Rehabilitation therapy; Research; Research Project Grants; response; Response to stimulus physiology; Risk Factors; Role; Scheme; screening; Sensory; sensory system; somatosensory; Surface; targeted treatment; Testing; Time; Torque; Traumatic Brain Injury; treadmill; Veterans; Visual; visual-vestibular; volunteer; Walking; Weight; Width; willingness; young adult; ","Balance Control Mechanisms, Age-Related Changes, and Methods for Improvement of Balance During Gait","001951","RRD3","Sensory Systems & Communication Disorders ","","","03","","","",""

EBV-induced malignancies have been challenging to target, in large part because EBV establishes a latent infection with complex and dynamic gene expression patterns. These gene expression patterns are referred to as ?latency types? that can adapt to diverse host cell types and immunological responses. This dynamic gene expression allows EBV to escape eradication by immune surveillance and persist as a long-term latent infection. Disrupting the natural capacity of EBV to modulate its gene expression pattern may offer a new approach for treating EBV+ cancers. The changes in viral gene expression are regulated by both viral and cellular factors, including epigenetic modulators. Altering epigenetic modulators is a promising approach as many newly developed drugs target these epigenetic modifiers. For EBV+ malignancies, however, the application of these drugs requires a more complete understanding of the epigenetic mechanisms that regulate the EBV latency. We previously discovered that an important epigenetic feature of EBV is the three-dimensional (3D) structure of the viral chromosome. Changes in 3D structure (i.e. chromatin looping) correlates with different patterns of gene expression. The primary factor that mediates the 3D genome structure in EBV is CTCF. Our preliminary work reveals for the first time that LMP1 activates PARP1 and that PARP1 activity modulates EBV 3D chromatin structure and prevents EZH2 from silencing the viral genome. Therapeutic strategies aimed at this axis may prove to be a novel, or complementary, approach to treating EBV+ cancers. Thus we hypothesize that LMP1/PARP1/EZH2 is an important regulatory axis that interconnects EBV 3D structure, chromatin modification and viral gene expression. Here we will test our hypothesis by: 1) Determine how changes in LMP1/PARP1 activity affect EBV chromatin loop formation; 2) Establish the role and mechanism of EZH2 in regulating EBV chromatin composition and structure; and 3) Establish that the latency state of EBV can be switched by pharmacological modulation of PARP1 and EZH2. The completion of this work will determine the role and pathogenic mechanisms of LMP1/PARP1/EZH2 axis in the epigenetic regulation of EBV gene expression. We anticipate providing a rationale for targeting PARP1 and/or EZH2 as a treatment for EBV+ malignancies ? as single agents or combination therapy. In the long run, this work has the potential to reveal new mechanisms of regulation of EBV infection, and potentially other viruses, and provide novel therapeutic approaches for treating EBV-induced malignancies.","10498150; ","TEMPERA, ITALO ;","BEISEL, CHRISTOPHER E","04/25/2018","03/31/2023","Adenosine Diphosphate Ribose; Adopted; ADP ribosylation; Affect; Anabolism; Anchorage-Independent Growth; Architecture; B-Lymphocytes; base; Biochemical; Biological Assay; Biological Models; Cell physiology; Cell Proliferation; cell type; Cells; Charge; ChIP-seq; Chromatin; Chromatin Loop; chromatin modification; Chromatin Structure; chromosome conformation capture; Chromosomes; Combined Modality Therapy; Complex; Data; Development; Dimensions; Drug Targeting; EBV-associated disease; EBV-associated malignancy; Epigenetic Process; epigenetic regulation; epigenetic therapy; Episome; Epstein-Barr Virus Infections; Epstein-Barr Virus latency; EZH2 gene; Family; FDA approved; gammaherpesvirus; Gene Expression; Gene Expression Profile; Genes; Genetic Transcription; Genome; genome sequencing; genome-wide; Goals; Heterogeneity; Histones; HIV; Human; Human Herpesvirus 4; Immune response; Immune system; Immunocompetent; Immunocompromised Host; Immunologic Surveillance; In Vitro; Individual; Infectious Mononucleosis; inhibitor/antagonist; latent infection; Latent virus infection phase; Link; LMP1; Lymphoma; Maintenance; Malignant Neoplasms; Maps; Mediating; member; Memory B-Lymphocyte; Metabolism; Methods; Methylation; Modification; Molecular Conformation; multicatalytic endopeptidase complex; mutant; novel; novel strategies; novel therapeutic intervention; pathogen; Pathogenicity; Pathology; Pattern; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Pharmacology; Play; Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases; Polycomb; Polymers; Population; Post-Translational Protein Processing; prevent; programs; Proliferating; promoter; Proteins; Reaction; Regulation; Role; Stomach Carcinoma; Structure; Switch Genes; Testing; Therapeutic; therapeutic target; three dimensional structure; Time; Transplant Recipients; Viral; Viral Genes; Viral Genome; Viral Proteins; Virus; virus genetics; Virus Latency; Virus Replication; Work; ","Regulation of Viral Chromatin Architecture During EBV Latency","130209","VIRA","Virology - A Study Section ","","A1","01","250000","146250","396250",""

We propose further development of a novel model for the transient delivery of oxygen to brain tissue, together with efforts that test and validate the model's predictions against precise local measurements of the blood oxygen-level dependent MRI contrast and flow changes induced by brief neural stimulation.","2110182; ","RESS, DAVID B;","KOENIG, JAMES I","05/15/2016","03/31/2020","Acute Brain Injuries; Affect; Arteries; arteriole; Atlases; base; Behavior; biomechanical model; Biomechanics; Blood; Blood capillaries; Blood flow; blood oxygen level dependent; blood oxygenation level dependent response; Blood Vessels; Brain; Brain imaging; Brain region; brain tissue; Cerebral cortex; cerebrovascular; Cerebrovascular Circulation; Cerebrovascular Disorders; clinical application; Complex; Convection; Coupled; Coupling; Data Set; Development; Diagnosis; Diagnostic; Diffusion; Elements; experimental study; Functional Imaging; Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Future; gray matter; hemodynamics; Human; Image; imaging modality; Imaging Techniques; Impairment; improved; Investigation; Link; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Measurement; Measures; Mechanics; Mediating; Metabolism; model development; Modeling; multisensory; neglect; network models; neural stimulation; Neurosciences Research; neurovascular; neurovascular coupling; novel; operation; optical imaging; Oxygen; oxygen transport; Pathology; Physics; Physiology; Protocols documentation; relating to nervous system; Resolution; response; Sampling; sensory integration; Series; Signal Transduction; Spin Labels; Stimulus; stroke; Structure; Testing; Time; Validation; Variant; Vasodilation; Venous; Work; ","Measurements and modeling of the hemodynamic response function in human cerebral cortex","095933","NOIT","Neuroscience and Ophthalmic Imaging Technologies Study Section ","","","03","238079","139276","377355",""

Diseases of this kind affect every organ system but the thyroid gland is an ideally-suited model system in which to study this problem. For example, unlike the situation in pancreatic beta cells in which compromised insulin production leads to a vicious cycle of detrimental effects on beta cell survival caused by glucoliptoxicity (diabetes) itself - when thyroid hormone production is compromised, the hypothyroidism does not harm thyrocytes. Indeed, ordinarily, hypothyroidism promotes compensatory thyroid gland expansion. However, we have developed a system that has the potential to provide deep mechanistic insight into what links ER protein misfolding to cell death, and we can quantify this in a straightforward way. Further, using the thyroid, an inability of compensatory tissue expansion is easily followed in real time, noninvasively, in living animals. The thyroid gland synthesizes thyroid hormone, which is essential for control of metabolism, development, and brain function. Thus, this application has broad general medical relevance. First, we highlight the thyroid gland as the best in vivo system available in which to study ER stress-mediated endocrine cell failure. Second, the grant provides a novel approach to understanding of thyroid hormone synthesis.","1877256; ","ARVAN, PETER ;","SECHI, SALVATORE","09/01/1988","03/31/2019","Affect; Animals; Antelopes; Back; Beta Cell; biological adaptation to stress; Biological Models; body system; Brain; Carrier Proteins; Cattle; Cell Culture Techniques; Cell Death; Cell Respiration; Cell surface; Cell Survival; Cells; Cholinesterases; Cretinism; Data; Defect; Detection; Development; Diabetes Mellitus; Diagnosis; Disease; Dwarfism; Endocrine; Endoplasmic Reticulum; endoplasmic reticulum stress; Equation; Exhibits; Failure; gene product; Genes; genetic linkage analysis; Goat; Goiter; Grant; Growth; growth hormone deficiency; Heterozygote; Human; Hypothyroidism; in vivo; Inherited; insight; Insulin; interest; Knockout Mice; Knowledge; Link; Malignant neoplasm of thyroid; Mediating; Medical; Metabolism; Modeling; Molecular; Mus; mutant; Mutation; novel; novel strategies; Pathway interactions; Patients; Phenotype; Physiological; Physiology; Pituitary Dwarfism; Predisposition; Prevention; Production; Protein Biosynthesis; Protein Conformation; protein misfolding; Protein Precursors; Protein Secretion; protein transport; Proteins; proteotoxicity; public health relevance; Rattus; Rodent; Scientist; Secondary to; selective expression; Severity of illness; Sheep; Structure of beta Cell of islet; System; Thyroglobulin; Thyroid Gland; Thyroid Hormones; Thyroxine; Time; Tissue Expansion; Transgenes; Vertebrates; ","Thyrocyte protein transport to the cell surface","040344","MCE","Molecular and Cellular Endocrinology Study Section ","","","30","315436","175067","490503",""

As it is the toxic gene product that drives all subsequent disease pathology in SCA7 and in related polyglutamine disorders, an accepted therapeutic paradigm for treating these diseases is to terminate the expression of the mutant gene product; hence, we will pursue ataxin-7 knock-down therapy using an antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) approach and a CAG-repeat targeting ASO or single-stranded short-interfering RNA (ss-siRNA) approach by continuing ongoing studies, being performed in collaboration with ISIS Pharmaceuticals. In this project, we will evaluate ONE ataxin-7 ASO and ONE CAG-targeting oligonucleotide as a treatment for retinal degeneration in preclinical trials in SCA7 knock-in mice, we will determine if efficacious oligonucleotides can reverse existing retinal disease and work as a therapy for SCA7 cerebellar degeneration, and we will perform transcriptome analysis to delineate the molecular basis of SCA7 neurodegeneration - all to establish if one (or both) of these oligonucleotide leads represents a viable therapy for use in human SCA7 patients.","1926731; ","LA SPADA, ALBERT R;","SHEN, GRACE L","08/01/2014","07/31/2018","","Ataxin-7 oligonucleotide knock-down to treat SCA7 retinal and cerebellar disease","024747","CDIN","Cell Death in Neurodegeneration Study Section ","","","05","157174","93911","251085",""

Of particular concern are the 'invisible wounds' of war, notably mTBI and PTSD which are often comorbid. Currently, the DVA is faced with providing care for increasing numbers of veterans with comorbid mTBI/PTSD. However, little is known about the most effective treatment for this population. Most current treatment recommendations suggest a holistic approach to treatment for comorbid mTBI/PTSD targeting symptoms and functionality rather than underlying etiology. The present study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of a new hybrid intervention, Cognitively-Augmented Behavioral Activation (CABA), for the treatment of PTSD, cognitive-problems, and functional impairment.

Central to this process is the formation of a blastema; a mass of cells that develop into the new limb. I will use a combination of genome sequencing, single-cell transcriptomics and genome editing to discover the genes that are active specifically in the blastema and to develop transgenic animals where only blastema cells are florescent. These results will offer a quantum leap in our understanding of salamander limb regeneration and the tools available for additional studies, which will help pave the road to making human limb regeneration a clinical reality.","12526871; ","ELEWA, AHMED ;","MELILLO, AMANDA A","04/25/2016","04/24/2019","Adult; Ambystoma; ATAC-seq; Bioinformatics; blastema; Body part; Brain Injuries; career; cell type; Cells; Chromatin; Clinical; Complex; CRISPR/Cas technology; Development; gene discovery; Genes; genetic signature; Genome; genome editing; genome sequencing; Genomic Segment; Genomics; Heart; Human; Human body; in vivo; insight; Knowledge; Laboratories; Libraries; Light; limb regeneration; Limb structure; Medicine; Modeling; Names; Natural regeneration; Newts; novel; Organism; post-doctoral training; Preparation; Process; promoter; Promoter Regions; public health relevance; quantum; regenerative; Regulation; Regulatory Element; Reporter; Research; restoration; Rodent; Salamander; skills; Stem cells; Surveys; tool; Training Programs; Transcriptional Regulation; transcriptome; transcriptomics; Transgenic Animals; Transgenic Organisms; Translational Regulation; Transplanted tissue; United States; Untranslated Regions; Vertebrates; whole genome; ","Discovering signature genes and developing expression markers for blastema cells","117806","ZRG1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","03","52140","","52140",""

In this context, the current study proposes the first evaluation of an integrated model whereby the effects of early life adversity on risk for poorer adulthood health are hypothesized to be partially ?transmitted? by childhood educational achievement and experiences. The unique dataset we will be using to test these hypotheses (i.e., the NICHD Study of Early Child Care and Youth Development, focused on a cohort followed prospectively from infancy) will also allow for (a) tests of alternative hypotheses related to childhood health (i.e., early ill health confounds the association between early education and adult health) and family background confounds (i.e., parental education and IQ confound the association between education and adult physical health) and (b) exploratory tests of childhood moderators and adult lifestyle mediators of the association between childhood educational variables and adult physical health risk markers.","9281335 (contact); 6100290; ","BLEIL, MARIA E.

The mechanisms that regulate neutrophil apoptosis and lifespan are only partially defined, and we identify a new role for neutrophil metabolic reprogramming as a mechanism to control neutrophil viability during infection that is also influenced by a polymorphism in the human gene that encodes a protein called TLR1. Thus, our studies will provide key new insight into the ability of metabolism and TLR1 signaling to influence neutrophil function and fate. As this TLR1 polymorphism is known to influence the severity of many infectious and inflammatory disorders that affect Veterans, including atherosclerosis, Lyme disease, arthritis, tuberculosis, colitis, bacterial sepsis and cancer, our studies are broadly relevant and our research plan includes testing of drugs that influence these pathways to identify potential targets for therapeutic intervention to improve Veterans? health.","1944822; ","ALLEN, LEE-ANN H.;","","04/01/2013","03/31/2022","adaptive immune response; Affect; Apoptosis; Apoptosis Regulation Gene; Arthritis; Atherosclerosis; base; BCL2/Adenovirus E1B 19kd Interacting Protein 3-Like; BIRC4 gene; Blood Circulation; Caspase; Cells; Cessation of life; Colitis; Conditioned Culture Media; Data; Defect; Development; differential expression; Disease; drug testing; Drug Utilization; Enzyme Induction; enzyme pathway; Experimental Designs; Francisella tularensis; Genes; Genetic Polymorphism; Glycolysis; Growth; Health; hexokinase; Human; hypoxia inducible factor 1; improved; Infection; Inflammation; Inflammatory; Inflammatory Response; Inhibition of Apoptosis; innovation; insight; Intervention; Kinetics; Leukocytes; Ligands; Link; Lipoproteins; Longevity; Lupus; Lyme Disease; macrophage; Macrophage Activation; Malignant Neoplasms; MAP Kinase Gene; MAPK14 gene; Mediating; Metabolic; Metabolism; Microbe; Mitochondria; mitogen-activated protein kinase p38; Neisseria gonorrhoeae; neutrophil; Nutrient; Organelles; Outcome; pathogen; Pathogenesis; Pathway interactions; Phagocytes; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Play; Process; Proteins; Pyelonephritis; receptor; Regulation; Research; Resolution; Role; Sepsis; Severities; Signal Transduction; Single Nucleotide Polymorphism; Symptoms; targeted treatment; Therapeutic; Therapeutic Intervention; Tissues; TLR1 gene; TLR2 gene; transcriptome; Tuberculosis; Tularemia; Up-Regulation; Veterans; ","Dysregulation of the inflammatory response by Francisella tularensis","002108","INFB","Infectious Diseases B ","","A1","05","","","",""

A single pharmacist cannot review each patient?s medication regimen at each visit and their effort must be focused toward the most appropriate patients. The Triage Algorithm for PACT Pharmacy Services (TAPPS) is a novel health informatics tool that we developed to provide pharmacists with simple real-time clinical reports to help make these decisions. The overall goal of the proposed study is to test the utility of TAPPS in a controlled setting and then to examine the effectiveness of TAPPS in real-world clinical practice using a mixed methods approach. This will include a randomized stepped wedge trial and qualitative interviews with PACT pharmacists to assess the effects of TAPPS on patient care and identify potential barriers to implementation.","10722324; ","LUND, BRIAN C.;","","01/01/2016","12/31/2018","Admission activity; Adverse drug event; Adverse event; Affect; Agreement; Algorithms; Ambulatory Care; base; beneficiary; care providers; Caring; Clinic; Clinical; clinical care; Clinical Data; Clinical Pharmacists; Clinical Pharmacy Service; clinical practice; Clinical Services; Cluster randomized trial; Consult; Controlled Environment; cost; Decision Making; design; Diabetes Mellitus; Disease; Drug Interactions; Effectiveness; effectiveness trial; Electronic Health Record; Emergency department visit; Ensure; Event; experience; Gatekeeping; Goals; Guidelines; Health; health information technology; Hospitalization; Hyperlipidemia; Hypertension; improved; Individual; innovation; Intervention; Interview; Lead; Licensing; Medical center; Medicare; Medication Management; member; Methods; Modeling; non-compliance; novel; Outcome; Outpatients; Patient Care; patient responsibilities; Patient-Focused Outcomes; Patients; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Pharmaceutical Services; Pharmacists; Pharmacotherapy; Pharmacy facility; Physicians; Play; Positioning Attribute; primary care setting; Primary Health Care; prospective; Public Health Informatics; Randomized; Recommendation; Regimen; Reporting; Risk; risk minimization; Role; Rural; Savings; Services; System; Testing; Time; tool; Triage; trial design; Use Effectiveness; Veterans; Visit; ","An Effectiveness Trial of the Triage Algorithm for PACT Pharmacy Services","001544","HSR5","HSR-5 Health Care System Organization and Delivery ","","","02","","","",""

However it is unclear whether routine post-operative ICU admission  actually improves surgical outcomes. In fact, admission to an ICU is associated with possible benefits,  but also with drawbacks and even risks of harm to the patient. Additionally, ICU admissions are costly. 5 Since there are no standard criteria for admission to the ICU after major surgery, a significant  opportunity exists to improve patient outcomes and reduce healthcare costs by improving post-  operative selection of appropriate candidates for ICU admission. Our overarching research aim is to develop objective criteria for ICU admission after major surgical procedures.

HIV prevention remains critical to turn the tide of HIV infections and an effective vaccine against HIV-1 is desperately needed. The ability of HIV-1 to escape immune responses represents a sophisticated hurdle that has to be resolved to develop a protective vaccine regimen. Similarly, continuous effort is required to develop vaccines that will impact HIV-1 co-morbidities represented by TB and malaria These initiatives will be based on the effort provided by young African scientists. The proposed IDA symposia will fill a gap in the ongoing effort of building scientific literacy on the continent and enhancing the acumen of performing immunology research by providing focused scientific training to the young African scientists. We believe that the proposed symposia will lead to increased scientific knowledge and will help build future scientific leaders on the Continent that will support the NIH effort (among many agencies) to perform clinical vaccine trials in Africa. In this grant, we now propose a further set of symposia, where the overarching aims of the IDA symposia are: 1) to continue to provide cutting-edge knowledge in the fields of HIV vaccine development and related aspects of malaria and TB; and 2) to foster scientific leadership on the African Continent.","6779612; ","FERRARI, GUIDO ;","GUTIERREZ, MARTIN","07/15/2009","01/31/2020","Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome; Affect; Africa; Africa South of the Sahara; African; Age; age group; AIDS prevention; AIDS/HIV problem; Animal Model; Anti-Retroviral Agents; antiretroviral therapy; Area; Back; base; Basic Science; Cause of Death; Cellular Immunity; Cessation of life; Child; Clinical Research; Clinical Trials; co-infection; Collaborations; Communicable Diseases; Comorbidity; Complex; cost; Country; Data; design; Development; Disease; Economics; Educational Curriculum; Educational process of instructing; Epidemic; European Economic Community; Event; experience; Face; Faculty; Fostering; Foundations; Funding; Future; Future Teacher; Grant; Guidelines; HIV; HIV Infections; HIV vaccine; HIV-1; HIV-1 vaccine; HIV/TB; Iatrogenesis; Immune; Immune response; Immune system; Immunity; Immunology; Incidence; Incubators; Infection; Infusion procedures; International Agencies; Investigation; Knowledge; knowledge base; Leadership; Learning; Malaria; meetings; Mentorship; Monitoring Clinical Trials; neutralizing antibody; novel vaccines; Outcome; Passive Immunization; pathogen; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Phase I Clinical Trials; Play; Population; pre-clinical; Prevalence; Prevention strategy; Progress Reports; Regimen; Reporting; Research; Research Personnel; Research Priority; Research Project Grants; Research Training; Role; Running; Science; scientific literacy; Scientist; Series; South Africa; success; symposium; teacher mentor; Thinking; Time; tool; Training; Tuberculosis; United States National Institutes of Health; Vaccine Clinical Trial; Vaccine Design; vaccine development; vaccine trial; Vaccines; World Health Organization; ","Infectious Diseases in Africa: Immune Escape and HIV Vaccines","084562","ZAI1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","08","51500","0","51500",""

Defects in skeletal development are often traced to defective cartilage development that can be attributed to abnormal programming of chondrocytes, the cells that produce the cartilage. In this proposal we have designed several new approaches to investigate the contribution of an enzyme called Site-1 protease (S1P) to normal cartilage and skeletal development. Our laboratory has shown that lack of S1P activity in chondrocytes in mice results in dwarfism with abnormal cartilage and no bone formation. Our observations indicate that S1P plays vital roles during cartilage development in a manner that has not been investigated before, namely in the maturation of other enzymes required to process the type II collagen, a major cartilage component. Our recent studies also indicate a role for S1P in bone growth and development. This proposal will lay the foundation for advancing our knowledge of S1P-directed regulatory mechanisms in bone and cartilage that could help correct defective skeletal and cartilage abnormalities in the future such as that seen in kyphosis/scoliosis or osteoarthritis, respectively","9759579 (contact); 1882196; ","PATRA, DEBABRATA  (contact); SANDELL, LINDA J;","CHEN, FAYE H","04/01/2015","03/31/2020","Ablation; Adolescent; Antibodies; Binding Proteins; Biological; biological adaptation to stress; Biological Process; bone; Bone Density; bone fragility; Bone Growth; Calcium; Cartilage; cartilage development; Cartilage Matrix; Cells; Chondrocytes; chondrodysplasia; clinical phenotype; Collagen Type II; Complex; Connective Tissue; Consensus Sequence; Coupled; Defect; Deformity; Degenerative polyarthritis; design; Development; Down-Regulation; Dwarfism; Embryo; Endoplasmic Reticulum; endoplasmic reticulum stress; Enzymes; Exhibits; Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer; Fluorescent Dyes; Foundations; Fura-2; Future; gel electrophoresis; Genes; Growth and Development function; Homeostasis; Image; insight; Intervertebral disc structure; Investigation; Knock-out; Knockout Mice; Knowledge; Kyphosis deformity of spine; Laboratories; Lead; Light; lipid metabolism; Lipids; long bone; Maintenance; Mass Spectrum Analysis; Membrane; Membrane Lipids; Microarray Analysis; Modeling; Molecular; mouse model; Mus; Mutation Analysis; novel; novel strategies; novel therapeutics; Osteoblasts; Osteocalcin; Osteogenesis; parathyroid hormone (1-34); Pathology; Pathway interactions; Peptide Hydrolases; Phenotype; Phosphorylation; Play; postnatal; Process; Procollagen; Property; Proprotein Convertases; Proteins; Proteolysis; public health relevance; Regulation; Regulatory Element; response; Role; scoliosis; secretory protein; Signal Pathway; site-1 protease; skeletal; skeletal abnormality; Skeletal Development; Skeleton; Spectrometry, Mass, Electrospray Ionization; spine bone structure; Sterols; System; trafficking; transcription factor; Transforming Growth Factor beta; two-dimensional; Type II Procollagen; Vertebral column; Vertebrates; ","The Dynamic Range of Site-1 Protease Functions in Skeletal Development","066590","SBSR","Skeletal Biology Structure and Regeneration Study Section ","","","04","220000","115500","335500",""

Proteins called monoclonal antibodies are also a major source of drugs, called biologicals, made by Biotech companies. Proteins often associate with each other: sometimes in biologically favorable ways, as when they form complexes to perform biological functions, and sometimes in biolog- ically unfavorable ways, as when they form amyloid, the basis for Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases and when they precipitate and aggregate in the formulations of biological drugs. This project will use theory and experiments to improve our understanding of protein interactions and aggregation in a variety of complex environments, such as in cells and in biological formulations. This will help us better understand disease states of proteins and help us provide better drug formulations.","1895519; ","DILL, KENNETH A;","LYSTER, PETER","09/01/2001","03/31/2019","Alzheimer's Disease; Amber; Amyloid; amyloid formation; Antibodies; aqueous; atomic interactions; base; Basic Science; Binding; Biological; Biological Process; Biology; Biotechnology; Cataract; Cells; Collaborations; Communities; Complex; Complex Mixtures; Computer Simulation; Crystal Formation; Crystallization; design; Development; Dill; Dimerization; dipole moment; Disease; driving force; Drug Formulations; Entropy; Environment; Excipients; experimental study; Eye Lens Protein; Formulation; Free Energy; Hand; Ice; improved; intermolecular interaction; Ions; Ligand Binding; Liquid substance; Mechanics; Methods; Microscopic; Modeling; Molecular; molecular recognition; Monoclonal Antibodies; Muramidase; nanomachine; Parkinson Disease; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Physics; Precipitation; prevent; Process; Property; protein aggregation; protein complex; protein folding; protein protein interaction; Proteins; public health relevance; Research Personnel; Salts; Sampling; Series; simulation; Sodium Chloride; Solubility; Solvents; Source; Statistical Mechanics; structural biology; Surface; Temperature; theories; Time; tool; Update; Viscosity; Water; web site; ","Modeling Aqueous Solvation in Biology","063592","ZRG1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","17","210207","78450","288657",""

Home-based exercise interventions that translate to a lifestyle with increased physical activity (PA) are an ideal strategy as 150 minutes of leisure time PA a week is associated with a significant reduction in risk of CVD related events and death. This novel research study will help develop a home exercise intervention that is largely accepted by OS Veterans, as a first step toward implementing PA into the routine medical care of the large Veteran population with COPD and OSA.

It is expected that the evidence generated in this study will inform health policies on the use of SF and other complementary and alternative medicines in relation to MDR-TB development. A central aim of the project is to leverage the strength in natural products research at the University of the Western Cape (UWC) while developing the capacity of UWC for biomedical research, particularly in TB. To this end, the project will establish a partnership between UWC, a historically disadvantaged institution, and the University of Cape Town (UCT), which is one of the leading institutions in biomedical research in South Africa.

The goal of this study is to develop a scientific evidence base beginning in infancy that distinguishes the normative irritability of early childhood from atypical irritability patterns. We will use a neurodevelopmental framework to characterize typical and atypical brain and behavioral patterns longitudinally from infancy to preschool age, including how infant irritability shapes and is shaped by proximal interactions with parents, and link these to dimensional patterns of clinical risk.

It is being implemented across VA as the, 'Patient Aligned Care Team' (PACT). It is unclear, however, how this PACT model applies to people whose predominant illness is treated by specialists. This is the case for people with serious mental illness (SMI), many of whom require ongoing treatment at mental health clinics. To achieve optimal health outcomes in the population with SMI, it may be necessary to adapt the PACT model so that it includes approaches that have proven to improve healthcare in this population.

High mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) is a nuclear protein that is important for maintaining DNA structure and function. However, during inflammation and injury HMGB1 is released from the cells. Once released it can act as a potent inflammatory agent that increases endothelial cell injury and death. We think SCD increases HMGB1 to increase endothelial cell injury and risk of RBC congestion and crisis. The goal of our study is to learn how HMGB1 increases inflammation, injures endothelial cells and increases vaso-occlusive crises in sickle cell disease.","1889791; 1867501 (contact); ","HILLERY, CHERYL A; PRITCHARD, KIRKWOOD A (contact);","KLAUZINSKA, MALGORZATA","04/01/2016","03/31/2020","activation-induced cytidine deaminase; Acute; Adhesions; Adhesives; Antibodies; Automobile Driving; Binding; Binding Proteins; Biological Markers; Blood Vessels; Cell Adhesion; Cell Death; Cell Death Signaling Process; cell injury; Cell Line; Cell Nucleus; Cells; Cessation of life; Chronic; Congestive; cytokine; cytotoxic; design; Disease; Disulfides; DNA; DNA Structure; Endothelial Cells; Enzymes; Equilibrium; Event; Functional disorder; Gene Expression; Goals; Health; Hemin; Hemoglobin; Hemopexin; Hepatocyte; HMGB1 Protein; Human; Hypoxia; Immune; Impairment; improved; In Vitro; in vivo; Inflammation; Inflammatory; injured; Injury; Interferons; Knowledge; Learning; Leukocytes; Link; Mediating; Molecular; Mus; NADPH Oxidase; Necrosis; neutralizing antibody; neutrophil; Neutrophil Activation; novel therapeutic intervention; Nuclear; Nuclear Protein; Nuclear Translocation; Obstruction; oxidation; Oxidative Stress; Oxides; Pathway interactions; Pattern; Peroxidases; Plasma; Play; Property; Protein Isoforms; public health relevance; receptor binding; receptor for advanced glycation endproducts; Recombinants; repaired; Reporter; Reporting; response; Risk; Role; Selectins; Sepsis; Sickle Cell; Sickle Cell Anemia; sickling; Signal Transduction; Source; Stress; Sulfhydryl Compounds; synergism; Testing; Tissues; TLR4 gene; Vasodilation; Xanthine Oxidase; ","Mechanisms of Inflammation in Sickle Cell Disease","128371","VCMB","Vascular Cell and Molecular Biology Study Section ","","","03","358303","147396","505699",""

Project Narrative Subtle, everyday experiences of racial discrimination are common among African Americans in the US and are associated with negative physical and mental health consequences. Existing research on racial discrimination and mental health relies heavily on cross-sectional and retrospective self-report measures, limiting researchers' ability to make causal inferences about the relationship between discrimination and mental health. Investigating the temporal dynamics of this relationship to establish causal precedence, as well as identifying neurocognitive vulnerability factors that may moderate this relationship, is important in developing interventions that mitigate the negative effects of discrimination on the mental health of individuals from racial minority groups.","12634984; ","VOLPERT-ESMOND, HANNAH ;","HUNTER, DELORIS","04/23/2018","","Address; Affect; Affective; African American; Anger; Anxiety; Anxiety Disorders; anxiety symptoms; anxious individuals; Attention; attentional bias; base; Behavioral; Categories; Cellular Phone; clinically relevant; Cognitive; Controlled Environment; depressive symptoms; design; Development; Discrimination; Distress; Ecological momentary assessment; Electroencephalography; Electrophysiology (science); Event; Event-Related Potentials; experience; Face; Future; Goals; Health; health disparity; Image; indexing; Individual; Individual Differences; insight; Intervention; Laboratories; Measurement; Measures; member; Mental Depression; Mental Health; Methodology; Methods; Minority Groups; Modeling; mood symptom; negative affect; Neurocognitive; neurophysiology; novel; Outcome; Participant; Patient Self-Report; physical conditioning; Process; programs; Psyche structure; psychologic; psychological distress; Psychophysiology; Race; racial discrimination; racial identity; racial minority; racism; relating to nervous system; Reporting; Research; Research Personnel; Research Training; response; Role; Sampling; selective attention; smartphone Application; Specificity; Stimulus; stressor; Symptoms; Testing; Time; time use; Training; university student; Work; ","Racial discrimination and mental health: Temporal dynamics and neurocognitive moderators","012751","ZRG1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","01","38481","","38481",""

The major limitation of fulvestrant stems from its well-known poor bioavailability and the standard intramuscular route of administration, which could be addressed by the availability of an orally bioavailable, more efficacious SERD. Zenopharm has recently developed ZB716, an orally bioavailable SERD that demonstrated superior bioavailability, pharmacokinetic profiles, and efficacy in multiple breast tumor models. Compared to fulvestrant, ZB716 afforded over 10-fold higher plasma drug concentration in animals at lower dosage. Zenopharm was awarded an SBIR phase 1 grant to initiate key preclinical studies to further demonstrate the feasibility of developing ZB716 for first in human trials. In the phase 2 application we propose to complete all IND-enabling studies in order to obtain approval from FDA to conduct clinical trials. The proposed work includes manufacture of the API for GLP toxicology studies and GMP drug substance and product for clinical use. At the conclusion of this SBIR phase grant, Zenopharm will be able to file an Investigational New Drug application for ZB716 to test safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics in humans.","11498369; ","WANG, GUANGDI ;","RAHBAR, AMIR M","04/01/2017","03/31/2020","Address; Advanced Malignant Neoplasm; Agreement; Animals; Aromatase Inhibitors; Award; Bioavailable; Biological Availability; Breast Cancer Model; Breast Cancer Patient; Canis familiaris; Capital; Categories; Chemistry; Clinic; Clinical; Clinical Paths; Clinical Research; Clinical Trials; Conduct Clinical Trials; Cyclic GMP; Data; Development; Development Plans; Disease; dosage; Dose; Drug Exposure; Drug Kinetics; drug metabolism; drug synthesis; Endocrine; Ensure; Estrogen Receptors; European; Evaluation; FDA approved; Fee-for-Service Plans; Fulvestrant; Funding; Grant; hormone therapy; Human; human study; In Vitro; in vivo; Intramuscular; Intramuscular Injections; Investigational New Drug Application; Laboratories; Lead; malignant breast neoplasm; Manufacturer Name; manufacturing facility; Medicine; Metastatic breast cancer; Methods; Modification; operation; Oral; Patients; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Pharmacologic Substance; Pharmacology; Phase; Phase I Clinical Trials; Phase II Clinical Trials; phase II trial; Plasma; pre-clinical; preclinical study; Process; process optimization; Production; Rattus; Reaction; Recovery; Regimen; research and development; Resistance; response; Rodent; Route; Safety; safety testing; scale up; Secure; Selective Estrogen Receptor Modulators; Small Business Innovation Research Grant; stem; Steroids; Tamoxifen; Techniques; Testing; Toxic effect; Toxicokinetics; Toxicology; tumor; Work; ","IND-Enabling Studies of ZB716, an Orally Bioavailable SERD","213462","ZRG1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","02","","","748371",""

BiP is an essential chaperone protein in the endoplasmic reticulum that helps to maintain homeostasis in healthy cells. It is a key player for the unfolded protein response and we speculate the regulation of BiP by FicD is essential for maintaining homeostasis. We plan to study how FicD turns BiP 'off' and discover how another enzyme turns BiP 'on', so that we can understand that basic machinery used by this signaling system. These studies will have great impact in determining how this system is corrupted in cells with disrupted protein homeostasis (proteostasis), such as cancer, diabetes, protein processing disorders and aging.","7763781; ","ORTH, KIM ;","GINDHART, JOSEPH G","03/01/2015","02/28/2019","Active Sites; Adenosine Monophosphate; Aging; alpha helix; ATP phosphohydrolase; ATPase Domain; Binding Sites; Biochemical; Bioinformatics; biological adaptation to stress; blind; Calcium; cancer cell; cancer type; capitate bone; Cell Death; Cell physiology; Cell Survival; Cells; Cellular Stress; Chemicals; Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats; Diabetes Mellitus; Disease; Drosophila melanogaster; Endoplasmic Reticulum; endoplasmic reticulum stress; Enzymes; Epitopes; Eukaryota; Eye; fly; Glucose; Goals; Growth; GRP78 gene; Homeostasis; Human; Infection; insight; Kinetics; Knock-out; Link; Malignant Neoplasms; Mediating; Messenger RNA; Modification; Molecular Chaperones; Molecular Conformation; Neuroglia; Normal Cell; Outcome; Oxidation-Reduction; pathogen; Pathway interactions; Physiological; prevent; protein folding; Protein Overexpression; Proteins; proteostasis; proteotoxicity; public health relevance; Regulation; response; rho GTP-Binding Proteins; Signal Pathway; Signal Transduction; Site; Stress; stressor; SWI1; System; Testing; Threonine; tool; Transcriptional Regulation; tumor; Vibrio parahaemolyticus; Virulence; ","Proteostasis, AMPylation and the Unfolded Protein repsonse (UPR)","115188","ZRG1","Special Emphasis Panel ","","","04","192500","119350","311850",""
