"9347073","Project Summary/Abstract  The corticospinal pathway is a pivotal mediator of voluntary motor control in humans and restoring corticospinal motor function after spinal cord injury remains one of the most substantial challenges facing translational and clinical neuroscience today. Regardless of the approach taken to alleviate the interruption of corticospinal axons, functional recovery will rely on the plasticity of the cortical motor network to incorporate the remodeled or replaced circuit. The creation of novel therapeutic interventions for the recovery of function after injury will have to be coupled to an understanding of the cellular and subcellular mechanisms that support cortical motor network remodeling and incorporation of injured neurons. Only recently have the tools necessary to answer these critical questions been developed. The long-term goal is to develop novel therapeutic interventions for the recovery of function after spinal cord injury through an understanding of the cellular and subcellular mechanisms that drive neural circuit remodeling. The overall objective for this proposal is to identify neuromodulatory mechanisms of motor map plasticity that correlate with recovery of skilled motor function and to determine the relationship between cortical network changes and corticospinal circuit remodeling after cervical spinal cord injury. The central hypothesis is that cholinergic input directly to corticospinal motor neurons is required for functional integration of corticospinal circuit changes into de novo motor networks after spinal cord injury. The rationale for the proposed research is that once the role of cholinergic activity in rehabilitation after spinal cord injury is defined, it is likely to provide new opportunities for pharmacological modulation and pairing with treatments that enhance corticospinal axon regeneration. The first approach will be to use cytotoxic lesions and optogenetic/chemogenetic control of relevant subcortical circuitry to modulate known mediators of motor learning while using two-photon microscopy to assess the functional incorporation of injured corticospinal neurons by measuring activity and structural changes during rehabilitation in awake, behaving animals. The second approach will be to define the molecular mechanisms and the cellular location of signaling events that underlie motor learning, and likely motor rehabilitation. The proposed studies are innovative in that they shift the focus of spinal cord rehabilitation onto the circuit mechanisms of cortical network plasticity and will have far- reaching importance in translating treatments for both acute and chronic injuries to motor networks. The proposed studies are significant because they will elucidate the mechanisms by which circuit remodeling influences recovery, which will have far-reaching importance in translating treatments for both acute and chronic injuries to cortical motor networks. The expectation is that completion of the proposed research will generate new opportunities for pharmacological modulation and combinatorial treatments that enhance corticospinal axon regeneration while mediating cortical motor network reorganization."
"9469063","PROJECT SUMMARY The Gram-negative bacterium Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, is estimated to inhabit the mouths of approximately 30% of the human population. It is associated with a variety of periodontal diseases, but A. actinomycetemcomitans is most predominantly associated with localized aggressive periodontitis (LAP), where it is detected in about 85% of the LAP cases. To evade the immune response of the host, the bacterium secretes the leukotoxin, LtxA. LtxA is a member of the repeat-in-toxin (RTX) family of toxins and exhibits a specificity for human WBCs driven by its recognition of the lymphocyte function-associated antigen 1 (LFA-1) integrin and its affinity for cholesterol. Both components are required for LtxA cytotoxicity, therefore, it is hypothesized that LFA- 1 and cholesterol play a combined role for LtxA activity. In our preliminary data, we have successfully purified LFA-1 from cell membranes and verified its functionality with regard to LtxA binding. We plan to reconstitute this transmembrane protein into proteoliposomes as part of a multifaceted approach using natural and model biological systems to determine how individual interactions of LtxA with LFA-1 and cholesterol lead to cell death. In Aim 1, we will investigate how LtxA is moved into the lipid raft compartment on the cell membrane by identifying changes in requirements for LtxA-LFA-1 and LtxA-cholesterol binding inside and outside of lipid raft domains. After LtxA has moved into the lipid rafts, it is endocytosed where it subsequently moves into the lysosome. In Aim 2, we will identify changes to LtxA and LFA-1 binding facilitated by the acidic environment inside the lysosomal lumen. At the conclusion of this project, we will have extensively expanded our knowledge on the roles of LFA-1 and cholesterol in the cytotoxic activity of LtxA, which will be useful for the future development of new therapeutic strategies against A. actinomycetemcomitans infections. We also expect these results to have broader implications through applying similar approaches to identify specific mechanisms of cytotoxic activity of other RTX toxins."

"9350443","In situ functional genomics to understand transcriptional regulation In the last 3 years, new gene editing technologies have revolutionized our ability to manipulate the human genome for basic research and for disease modeling. Targeted gene knock-out and precision gene repair ? previously laborious or impossible tasks in human cells ? are now routine. Despite these advances in genome surgery, much of how the genome is translated into phenotype remains a mystery and the most mysterious regions are those in the noncoding genome. Unlike with protein-coding genes, there is no Central Dogma-like framework to decipher how the noncoding genome functions. The goal of this proposal is to address a fundamental problem in transcriptional regulation: How can we identify the sequences and proteins that govern the expression of any gene, in an unbiased way? Consortium efforts like ENCODE and the Epigenomics Roadmap have produced large catalogs of biochemical hallmarks that correlate with noncoding function. However, correlation does not equal causation. Proving that certain regions of the genome regulate gene expression or act as landing pads for DNA-binding proteins requires unbiased mutagenesis and interrogation. In part, the problem has to do with size. The noncoding genome is a vast expanse: Noncoding regions constitute >98% of the 3 billion DNA bases in the human genome. We urgently need high-throughput, molecular microscopes capable of zooming in on functional regions and recording how proteins interact at these loci. Given new advances in genome engineering and high-throughput sequencing, we are in a prime position to understand the functional, gene-regulatory architecture of the noncoding genome. Here, we will apply our established expertise to examine functional regions of the noncoding genome in their endogenous context. Using human cancer and stem cell lines as model systems, we will develop five broadly- applicable cross-disciplinary platforms by harnessing recent advances in scalable DNA synthesis, genome engineering, droplet cell capture, deep sequencing and quantitative proteomics and thereby enable: 1) higher resolution noncoding CRISPR screens using Cas9 orthologs and 2) increased span (chromosome-scale) noncoding CRISPR screens using the new Cas enzyme Cpf1; 3) multidimensional readouts of entire gene networks by combining pooled mutagenesis with single-cell RNA-seq; 4) unbiased labeling of all transcription factors stationed at functional elements identified in CRISPR screens via a novel Cas9-enabled proteomic technology; and 5) applying this fleet of new technologies jointly to reveal dynamics of functional elements in neural differentiation and cancer drug resistance."
"9395809","Project Summary/Abstract  Millions of people suffer from some form of paralysis. In most of these cases the connection between the brain and the spinal cord is damaged, however, the motor cortex is healthy and intact. Thus, for these individuals, brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) hold significant promise for improving quality of life. BMIs decode an individual's intention to move by utilizing statistical models of neural activity patterns recorded from the motor cortex using implanted electrode arrays. While these methods have been encouraging in preclinical experiments and clinical trials for controlling thought-driven 2D computer cursors, they suffer from poor performance when applied to higher degrees-of-freedom (e.g., robotic limbs), and are not robust to the inevitable degradation of the electrode array. In order to address these clinical needs, this project starts from the recent observation that just as some behaviors are easier to learn, some patterns of neural activity, termed neural states, are also easier to generate. The overarching goal of this project is to elucidate if these ?easy to generate? neural states can be used to robustly control a prosthetic arm. This is a significant departure from current decoding methods, which incorporate little to no information about the motor system, especially its ability to learn and adapt. The first major aim of this work is to develop experiments and analysis methods in order to find these ?easy to generate? neural states in the non- human primate (i.e., rhesus monkey) motor system. Here ?easy to generate? can be understood as the monkey's ability to volitionally generate that particular neural state. The second major aim of this work is to characterize the properties of the motor system that enable some states to be more easily generated than others. Prior work in our lab has shown that motor cortical population activity has well-defined structure, as predicted by dynamical system theory. These dynamics cause neural states to evolve in lawful ways through time. The work here will extend these findings by characterizing the dynamics associated with a monkey learning to generate a neural state. Finally, the third major aim of this work is to determine if neural states that monkeys can volitionally generate can be utilized for robust control of a prosthetic arm. The central hypothesis of this work is that building a model that only utilizes firing patterns that can be easily generated (as determined experimentally) will enable robust and high-performance control of a prosthetic arm. If successful, this study could have significant clinical impact by presenting a new paradigm to enable robust control of a prosthesis."
"9355040","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Gene therapy with adeno-associated virus (AAV) has emerged as a promising treatment option for a variety of diseases, including those afflicting the cardiovascular system. Unfortunately, humoral immune responses against the AAV capsid prevent the ability to re-administer the viral vector as needed. In addition to the anti- AAV capsi antibody responses, tissue targeting is another major hurdle to effective cardiac gene therapy. Previously, we designed a Protease-Activatable Virus (PAV) based on AAV that is stimulated by overexpressed matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) in diseased tissues. Although the PAVs may enable more targeted delivery to sites of disease, they will also suffer from antibody responses against the capsid just like the unengineered vectors. To overcome this problem, I hypothesize that genetically inserting a `self-peptide' into the PAV capsid (PAV-SP) will minimize phagocytic uptake, ultimately decreasing neutralizing antibody production. The aims of this fellowship project are the following: 1) genetically clone and structurally characterize PAV-SP and 2) functionally characterize PAV-SP with in vitro models."
"9145187","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The broad, long-term objective of this project is to enable patients with uterine fibroids (UF) to make informed decisions about management options based on the highest possible quality evidence. To help achieve this objective, we propose a multi-center registry of a geographically, racially, ethnically, and clinically diverse group of women who have received medical or surgical treatment for UF, Comparing Options for Management: Patient-centered Results for Uterine Fibroids (COMPARE-UF), designed to address the following specific aims: AIM 1) Develop the infrastructure necessary to implement large-scale observational comparative effectiveness research (CER) studies of management options for women with UF, including (a) a governance structure, policies, and procedures conducive to collaborative research involving patients, clinicians, methodologists, and other stakeholders, (b) an experienced Research and Data Coordinating Center, and (c) nine geographically diverse Clinical Centers (CCs) representing a broad range of patients and providers. AIM 2) Use this infrastructure to implement 3 projects addressing high-priority evidence gaps related to the effect of different management strategies on patient-centered outcomes. These include PROJECT 1: Comparing management options for symptom relief PROJECT 2: Comparing management options for preserving reproductive function PROJECT 3: Comparing effectiveness in different subpopulations. AIM 3) Evaluate innovative methods for the design, conduct, and analysis of observational comparative effectiveness research in this population. AIM 4) Translate research results into improved patient care, through both traditional peer-reviewed publications and collaborations with stakeholders to integrate the research findings into evidence-based patient decision making tools, clinical practice guidelines, and quality measures."
"9353310","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Older Americans rely on the emergency department (ED) for acute, unscheduled care. Unfortunately, many older adults experience poor outcomes after ED visits, suggesting that these encounters represent missed opportunities to identify high risk patients and intervene to improve the transition to outpatient care. In particular, significant falls among older adults are a serious and preventable problem. Unscheduled ED visits offer an opportunity to identify older adults at higher risk of falls than the general primary care population at a time when fall risk factors can be modified, and thus offer an ideal additional setting for fall screening beyond primary care. Such screening is advocated in the ED, but screening interventions often fail due to time constraints of providers in the emergency setting. As electronic health record (EHR) systems evolve, computerized decision support offers the potential to support fall screening with less provider burden. The objective of this proposal is to identify adults at high risk for future falls and improve their care both during their ED visit and after discharge. As a physician scientist, my goal is to lead an independent research program to improve transitions to outpatient care following ED visits for older adults. This 5-year proposal will advance these goals by providing the necessary support and training in implementation science as well as informatics-based interventions. I have a unique background in engineering, emergency medicine, and health services research and am well prepared to successfully complete the proposal. I will be aided by a team of expert mentors at an institution with substantial resources and an outstanding environment to conduct the research proposed and transition to an independent investigator with R01 support. The proposed aims are to: 1) Compare EHR-based data extraction to in-person screening of future outpatient fall risk, 2) Using data available in the EHR at the time of presentation, develop a predictive algorithm to risk- stratify ED patients for risk of significant falls in the next 6 months, and 3) Design and pilot a clinical decision support intervention to identify older adults at high risk of falls and improve their care both in the ED and after discharge. These aims will be accomplished by creating and analyzing a database linking the EHR and claims data, incorporating novel elements derived by natural language processing, by utilizing machine learning in addition to traditional statistical techniques, and by developing and piloting an intervention in one health system."
"9431079","Progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) is the most common frontotemporal lobar degeneration associated with tau pathology. While rare pathogenic variants, common risk factors, and ? more recently ? rare risk-associated variants have been identified in PSP, a significant proportion of the heritability for neurodegenerative tauopathies and other frontotemporal lobar degenerations remains unexplained, strongly suggesting that additional genetic risk factors await discovery. In this application, we propose to identify novel genetic variation associated with PSP using a multi-stage strategy. First, we will detect variants through whole-genome sequencing of neuropathologically characterized PSP. Second, we will prioritize pathological brain tissue samples for a multidimensional screen that includes transcriptional, proteomics, and epigenetic assays. Through recursive application of a prioritization algorithm, regions and variants most likely to have a high impact on disease risk will be identified. Finally, we will follow up on these variants using a high-throughput functional screen. This project taps unprecedented pathologic resources of PSP, leverages a pathologic and genetic infrastructure created with support from private foundations, and offers to transform our understanding of the genetic architecture of PSP and to advance towards the biology and downstream effects of this prototypical tauopathy downstream effects of this prototypical tauopathy."
"9564547","The Central Core Facility is a cluster of rooms on the 6th floor of the Science Building. One central core room is equipped with three ultracentrifuges and several high-speed centrifuge units (Room 610). Another core facility was established with a cold room and dark room, a scintillation counter, FPLC equipment, an LKB spectrophotometer and a scanning densitometer (Room 613). A new prep room with a glassware washer attached to a deionizing water system and autoclave was also established (Room 612). Ms. Duan Lo is our glass washer. In 2008, the 20-year-old Amsco glassware washing machine was replaced with a new Reliance 500 Steris washer, with all accessories needed to service the entire RCMI community. This room also houses two cooling units for the ultracentrifuges. Likewise, the 1985 Amsco Eagle autoclave was replaced by the Steris 20X20X38 Century Model. The 30-year-old NBS Shaking Incubator, inherited from Dr. Paul Margolin in 1985, was replaced by a NBS Innova 4200. Another central facility room (605A) houses six ultra-low temperature freezers, a SpeedVac system, and a large capacity incubator-shaker (Room 609). The RCMI is responsible for the maintenance contracts for the freezers. Room 609 is separated into two sections by a wall. Another shared instrument room has been established containing an analytical HPLC (Room 613A). Down the hall in room 605 there are 6 temperature control rooms. Investigators can vary the temperature for use as an incubator or a refrigerator. These rooms are old and built into the wall. Maintenance and repairs are the responsibility of the RCMI program. The cost for all of the gases (CO2 and liquid N2, and dry ice is shared by the RCMI program and the Dean's office. The Dean's office covers the service contracts for the autoclaves and the glass washer ($15K/yr). They also pay for the service contract for the X-ray developer in the dark room ($3K/yr). The RCMI program pays for the service contracts on all other equipment. Each user is required to sign-in and Sheila Ehlinger, our chief technician, checks the logbooks daily. She also trains students to use each apparatus. The Central Core facility is used by all RCMI investigators, their post-doctoral fellows and graduate students. Details of each participant are given in the Biographical Sketch Section of this proposal. We are requesting funds for the chief technician, Shelia Ehlinger who oversees all of our core facilities and technicians. We are requesting funds to pay our glassware washer, funds to purchase supplies for our tissue culture facility, funds to purchase an ELISA plate reader, and funds to cover a service contract for two real-time PCR machines. Ms. Sheila Ehlinger is responsible for the supervision of our physical facilities and manages all of our technicians. She makes sure time sheets are on time and reports problems to the PI. She ensures that supplies are maintained on hand, performs simple repairs and ordinary maintenance and coordinates calls to outside service providers when indicated, and follows the repair process to completion. She also coordinates all renovations and purchases for new hires. She is the supervisor for the Central Core Facility and has been with the Program for 20 years. She came to us from NYU where she was Head of Facilities Management for the entire Biological Sciences. We are requesting funds to support our glassware washer, Ms. Duan Lo. Ms. Lo performs the prosaic but essential task of keeping glassware clean and maintaining its availability. She is located in the Central Core (Room 612) and has been with the Program for over 10 years. Ms. Lo retrieves dirty glassware from the laboratories of Gunner, Ali, Small, Janakiraman, Steinberg, Govind, Hubbard, Guyden, Gottlieb, Venkatesh, Pezzano, Spatz, Caplan, Li, Saleque, Levitt, Ryan, Calhoun, Ghose. She then returns dean glassware to each individual laboratory. In the above labs, some glassware needs to be washed every day, some of laboratories need glassware washed three times a week; some wash twice a week. As a result, the machine is used continuously (six times per day, 60 minutes per run). Ms. Lo also autoclaves the waste materials from the above laboratories. We are requesting $16K for replacement of the ELISA plate reader in the Central Core. This equipment is currently more than 10 years old and is heavily used by many members of the Immunology group to screen serum for antibodies, screening hybridoma supernatants and performing ELISAs for cytokine analysis. This is the only ELISA plate reader available to the researchers and the company no longer services the machine. We are also requesting a service contract for the two real-time PCR machines ($5K) currently housed in the flow cytometry core and managed by Jeff Walker. We currently have only two real-time PCR machines that are used almost continuously by researchers from all areas, particularly neurobiology, cancer and immunology. The PCR machine is used on average 18 times per week with very long runtimes. It is used by Steinberg, Ali, Saleque, Pezzano, and Li."
"9348623","PROJECT SUMMARY The introduction of large-scale genomic testing in medicine promises to transform patient care. Cancer is at the leading edge of this revolution and hundreds of thousands of cancer patients receive tumor genomic testing yearly. Despite rapid adoption of genomic testing in cancer, many patients fail to comprehend basic genetic concepts and the defining genomic characteristics of their disease. Given that better-informed patients can more effectively engage in their care, and that greater knowledge is associated with improved cancer-related outcomes, there are significant concerns that patients' genomic knowledge deficits will contribute to poor quality care and outcomes. In this context there is an urgent need to educate patients about cancer genomics generally, and their sequencing results specifically, in a format that is usable, useful, and that easily integrates into existing clinical workflows. We propose to address this gap in care quality by identifying patients' needs for sequencing information and using that knowledge to design a dynamic, patient-facing, web-based cancer genome sequencing report that will integrate with the electronic health record (Aim 1). During the design process, we will elicit input from cancer patients, family members and clinicians to ensure that the web report is useful, usable, and that it easily integrates into clinical workflows. In the second phase, we will evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of delivering sequencing results and genomic education via the web report to cancer patients treated in academic and community settings (Aim 2). On completion of this project, we will be well positioned to test the effectiveness of the web-based patient sequencing report in a full-scale implementation trial. We hypothesize that when the web report is used to augment the return of cancer genome sequencing results, 1) it will increase patients' knowledge, their ability to actively participate in care, and their ability to share genomic information with family members; 2) it will increase oncologists' recommendations for genomically targeted therapies; and 3) it will improve patient-provider communication, care satisfaction and the efficiency of care delivery. This pilot and feasibility health IT project, addressing the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality's Design Research Area, will leverage the IT network that we have developed which stores genome- sequencing data; generates dynamic, physician-directed reports; and matches patients to relevant clinical trials. Our commitment to open source development will allow universal access to the source code and facilitate widespread dissemination of the web-based patient sequencing report and IT network. By providing patients with direct access to their sequencing results, we aim to ensure that they understand the essential genomic characteristics of their disease and give them the knowledge that they need to actively participate in cancer care decisions. If successful, the project will facilitate patient engagement in care and serve as a critical step forward in the goal to improve the quality of cancer care delivery."
"9452394","Many mutations resulting in neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders target synaptic proteins. Synapse remodeling and loss precedes cell death in neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's or Parkinson's, and addictive drugs are known to alter synaptic function. The convergence of many brain disorders at the synapse, indicate that its integrity is critical to normal brain function. Monitoring synapse lifetime and assembly/disassembly in vivo has been hampered by the difficulty of discretely labeling and simultaneously tracking the recruitment and assembly of its individual components. Technology for robust, real-time visualization of synapse formation and loss in vivo would enable the exploration of this fundamental feature of brain development and plasticity, and its dysfunction in brain disease. Our goal is to address this need by developing high-resolution, high throughput temporal focusing (TF) two-photon microscopy for large-volume imaging of synapse assembly-disassembly in the living mouse brain. We propose two aims: 1) Design and implement TF two-photon microscopy for imaging an entire neocortical neuron at synaptic resolution in vivo in less than one minute. Imaging small structures in vivo, especially within the context of the full dendritic arbor, imposes significant time demands due to the need for increased sampling and longer dwell times. Currently, imaging an entire neuron at synaptic resolution takes 60-90 minutes. It is impossible to track events on the order of hours or minutes with such long scan times, or to stably image in awake mice. We propose a novel parallelized approach, line scanning TF two-photon microscopy, to enable in vivo imaging with throughput at least two orders of magnitude higher than point scanning, but with comparable resolution and signal-to-noise ratio. We will test the feasibility of this approach for imaging synaptic structural dynamics in real time, in the awake mouse. 2) Incorporate multi-spectral capabilities into a TF imaging system to enable in vivo tracking of multiple synaptic labels across a single neuron. Visualizing multiple discrete subcellular structures in vivo requires methods for efficient spectrally resolved imaging in deep tissue. We have achieved simultaneous three-color imaging with a single focus scanning multiphoton microscope using Ti-Sapphire lasers and an optical parametric amplifier (OPA) as light sources. However, these devices do not provide light pulses with sufficient peak power for highly parallelized imaging. We will extend the capability of the high-throughput line-scan TF imaging system by implementing multi-color excitation using a regenerative amplifier delivering femtosecond pulses at 1040 nm combined with a tunable OPA providing additional pulses in the 650-1600 nm range. This will allow simultaneous excitation of a broad palette of fluorescent proteins, enabling the tracking of multiple synaptic components at once. The technology we propose will provide a new and powerful tool for dissecting the synaptic roots of many disorders that affect formation, stability, and plasticity of excitatory and inhibitory synapses."
"9360829","Project Summary/Abstract The mid-brain raphe nucleus is a highly conserved structure present throughout vertebrates and holds a widespread interest because it is the source of the serotonergic network of the entire brain. Although variation exists among serotonergic neuronal population, still little is known about their differences. Even less is known about the non-serotonergic neuronal population. The precise projection of each population of neurons is also not identified. Studies in various animals have implicated raphe nucleus in functions including; sleep, arousal, fear, reward, aggression, and pain. Also, serotonin imbalance has been found to increase susceptibility to neurological disorders such as autism. However, which population of neurons is responsible for modulating any of these behaviors, and what are their roles is yet to identify. Therefore in this application, I will address some of these issues using six day old larval zebrafish. A much simpler but conserved brain structure to mammals, transparency in the earlier stages, huge clutch size and amenability to genetic modification make them an ideal system for the proposed research. Using the Burgess laboratory collection of transgenic and enhancer trap lines, I will identify various serotonergic and non-serotonergic population of neurons in the raphe nucleus in aim 1 by imaging. I will further characterize them with RNA-seq experiments followed by the in situ hybridization and generate their molecular profile. My preliminary data already suggest that there is multiple sub-populations of non- serotonergic neurons exist. In aim 2, I will generate the projectome profile by stochastically labeling individual neurons in each of these sub populations using Gal4/Cre intersectional approach. To identify functional subregions, genetically encoded calcium indicator (GCaMP) will be expressed in the lines used in aim 1 and will be imaged while subjecting the larvae to flow stimulus. Neurons in the same functional subregions will show similar Ca++ activity. I will test the hypothesis that mutation in an autism candidate gene, solute carrier family 6, member 4 (slc6a1), a ?-amino acid butyric acid (GABA) transporter, causes persistent GABA neurotransmission resulting in serotonin imbalance and manifests autism like behavior in aim 3. First, I will generate mutants in the lines characterized in aim 1 and 2. I will check developmental defects by imaging population of the raphe neurons in mutants and comparing them to their wild type siblings. The functional defects will be tested similar to aim 2 because heightened sensory responsiveness is a common autism symptom. By the end of this study, I aim to generate clear functional subdivision of raphe neurons and identify their role in the autism that may be applicable for the therapeutic intervention."
"9419040","PROJECT SUMMARY Intrinsic immunity to HIV is counteracted by accessory virulence factors, which, typically, reprogram E3 Ub ligases to remove HIV restriction factors from infected cells by targeting them for degradation by proteasome. Indeed, the studies of HIV accessory proteins have led to the identification of major HIV restriction factors, which in turn revealed new anti-viral mechanisms. HIV-1 Vpr accessory protein binds to CRL4DCAF1 E3 ubiquitin ligase and uses this enzyme to antagonize specific postreplication DNA repair proteins, such as uracil DNA glycosylase (UNG2), HLTF DNA helicase and MUS81 structure specific nuclease. Furthermore, we recently identified Exonuclease 1 (Exo1) DNA repair protein as a novel target of the hijacked by Vpr CRL4DCAF1 E3. HIV-1 Vpr was also reported to bind DNA processing proteins, which associate with a large protein complex assembled on SLX4 scaffold that connects to diverse DNA repair pathways. The fact that Vpr interacts with and disrupts multiple aspects of the cellular DNA repair machinery is intriguing, as there is little doubt that Vpr antagonism with this machinery should ultimately benefit HIV-1. Nevertheless, very little is known about how the DNA repair proteins targeted by Vpr impinge on HIV-1 replication and the underlying mechanism(s) have not been thoroughly investigated.  This application focuses on how DNA repair proteins antagonized by Vpr and those controlled by the SLX4 scaffold impinge on HIV-1 replication. We recently confirmed that HIV-1 Vpr promotes HIV-1 replication in dividing T cells and linked this effect to Vpr's ability to antagonize DNA repair proteins via CRL4DCAF1 E3. We also demonstrated that an as yet unidentified component controlled by the SLX4 scaffold inhibits HIV-1 infection. We hypothesize that the above DNA repair proteins act on intermediates in the synthesis of the double stranded HIV-1 cDNA prior to, or following provirus integration, thereby inhibiting HIV-1 infection, and that some of these effects are counteracted by HIV-1 Vpr. Here we propose to characterize the interactions between DNA repair proteins targeted by Vpr, as well as those controlled by the SLX4 scaffold, with the HIV-1 cDNA and elucidate how they inhibit HIV-1 replication. In particular, we will characterize the actions of DNA repair proteins that are antagonized by Vpr to stimulate HIV-1 replication (SA1), identify steps that the SLX4 complex and Vpr-CRL4DCAF1 E3-targeted HLTF and Exo1 act on (SA2), and characterize DNA repair pathways and activities that inhibit HIV-1 (SA3). Overall, this application will describe the molecular mechanisms mediating the inhibition of HIV-1 replication in dividing T lymphocytes by cellular DNA repair machinery, and those used by HIV-1 Vpr to antagonize the inhibition. "
"9357392","BIORESOURCES CORE: Resources for FSHD research and clinical trials Abstract Access to well characterized patient biological samples was critical for the recent advances in our understanding of the underlying disease mechanisms in FSHD. The continued availability of these finite resources remains critical for the current scientific projects 1-3. Moreover, as clinical trials in FSHD in the near future become a reality, the need for relevant outcome measures becomes a priority. The major aims of the Scientific Core are to provide the scientific projects with the necessary, clinically and genotypically well characterized biological resource, and to work in parallel with the scientific projects on clinical trial preparedness. The specific aims of the Scientific Core accomplish these goals by: Aim1 generating the necessary tissue and cell lines from subjects with FSHD1, FSHD2 and normal controls; Aim 2, generating a large set of FSHD and control sera and investigating identified DUX4 targets in muscle tissue for potential biomarkers as well as test and validate promising clinical outcome measures. Together, these aims will not only provide the necessary biological resources to meet the needs of all three PO1 scientific projects, but will also assist in the development of the tools necessary for the conduct of future clinical trials in FSHD. 1"

"9482256","PROJECT SUMMARY Since the discovery of combined anti-retroviral therapy (cART) the incidence of many of the complications of infection with HIV-1 have been dramatically decreased. One exception to this trend are neurologic complications. HIV associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND) is a spectrum of disorders that can range from mild cognitive problems to dementia. While the incidence of dementia has decreased, the milder forms of HAND has remained basically unchanged despite our ability to reduce circulating virus to undetectable levels. The exact cause of HAND largely remains a mystery. Virus quickly invades the brain and is thought to establish a foothold in microglia and infiltrating macrophages. After initiation of therapy even though the amount of virus decreases significantly, levels of some viral proteins persist and are thought to contribute to immune activation. One such protein is Nef. Even cells that are completely virally suppressed can continue to produce Nef. We have shown that production of Nef is sufficient to drive the production of exosomes. Indeed, it has been shown that astrocytes, transfected with the gene for Nef and placed into healthy brains of Rats can induce neurocognitive defects. These data suggest that both Nef and astrocytes play a key role in the pathogenesis of HAND. We hypothesize that infected astrocytes produce exosomes, which can interact with other cells in the brain and upregulate the expression and secretion of amyloid to cause cognitive impairment. In this proposal, we will determine whether Nef exosomes are present in the plasma and CSF of HAND patients with mild cognitive impairment (ANI or MND), determine if their numbers correlate with severity of disease, and determine if these exosomes can induce amyloid expression and markers of neuronal inflammation using a primary iPSC brain model (mini-brains). To determine if CSF exosomes are derived from astrocytes, we will use magnetic beads with antibody attached to the astrocyte-specific marker GLAST. We will also determine if human primary astrocytes, infected by HIV-1, can produce Nef exosomes and could be source of CSF exosomes. This study will provide important information on the role that Nef exosomes could play in the development of HAND and provide important insight into this increasingly important complication of HIV/AIDS."
"9450090","PROJECT SUMMARY Moment-to-moment fluctuations in behavioral and brain states have been shown to have profound effects on perception and behavior in both humans and experimental animals. The variability in behavioral responses caused by these fluctuations have real world effects because they can cause an individual to respond inappropriately in high stakes and demanding situations, such as driving a car or operating on a patient. In addition, if not accounted for, the fluctuations can be a source of increased variability in both clinical therapies and systems neuroscience research, reducing the effectiveness of treatments and the robustness of experimental results. So far, much of the progress in understanding the effects of state on neural processing has come from experiments in sensory circuits. But knowing how state affects sensory processing isn?t enough to understand how it affects behavior because there are many additional downstream stages of neural circuit processing before the final motor output. The goal of this project is to examine the effects of state on both sensory and motor systems for the same behavior. This will be accomplished by taking advantage of a sensorimotor task (delay eyeblink conditioning, dEBC) in which much of the processing between sensory and motor systems occurs within a single brain area (the cerebellum). The experiments will involve first developing novel quantitative methods based on psychophysics to test the effects of state on dEBC. Two different types of behavioral state will be examined?locomotion and arousal?and the experiments are designed to tease apart the relative effects of these two states on dEBC. The experiments will then use large scale imaging and electrophysiology to test if and how the input (sensory) and output (motor) neurons of the cerebellum are affected by state. The results of these experiments will provide the first glimpse of how an entire neural system and behavior are dynamically modulated by state on a subsecond to second timescale. A greater understanding of the impact of state on the neural processing underlying behavioral performance will provide critical information for optimizing experimental design and therapies."
"9272475","Parkinson's disease is the most common neurodegenerative movement disorder and is characterized pathologically by the intraneuronal deposition of abnormally phosphorylated and aggregated ?-synuclein protein. Abnormal deposition of ?-synuclein into neuronal and glial aggregates is also the primary pathologic feature of a group of collectively even more common disorders, termed the ?-synucleinopathies. To define the molecular mechanisms controlling ?-synuclein induced neurodegeneration we and others have modeled ?-synucleinopathies in the simple and powerful genetic model organism Drosophila. Genetic, biochemical and cell biological experiments in Drosophila have provided important clues regarding the pathogenesis of ?-synucleinopathies. However, the unbiased forward genetic screens providing the bases for these studies, while valuable, have to date remained incomplete. Here we propose to use a newly created and powerful Drosophila model of ?-synucleinopathies to perform a comprehensive genetic analysis of ?-synuclein neurotoxicity in vivo. These studies will for the first time provide a broad analysis of mechanisms controlling ?-synuclein toxicity to postmitotic neurons and should identify many new high-value therapeutic targets. Our studies will be particularly important as more and more data emerges from genome wide associated studies showing genetic influences on Parkinson's disease and related ?-synucleinopathies, but with little clear evidence as to the mechanism of action of these newly identified gene products in neurodegenerative disease pathogenesis."
"9565041","ABSTRACT Aging drives the development of cardiac hypertrophy, an independent risk factor for heart failure, coronary heart disease, and other cardiovascular events that affect millions of people worldwide. The pathogenesis of age-related cardiac hypertrophy is governed by blood-borne factors, and prior seminal studies have identified growth differentiation factor 11 (GDF11) as a prominent systemic regulator of the condition. In those studies, a natural decline in blood GDF11 levels coincided with the onset of cardiac hypertrophy in old mice, and treatment with recombinant GDF11 reversed the hypertrophic effects. Recent efforts have challenged those initial findings, suggesting that: 1) GDF11 levels may also increase over time, an alteration that appears to promote cardiac hypertrophy, and 2) some of the effects previously attributed to GDF11 may in fact be caused by its homolog, myostatin (GDF8). As a result, there is a critical need to define the true relationship between GDF11 levels and age-related cardiac hypertrophy, and to identify the major determinants of that relationship. The disparate findings to this point demand novel approaches to address the knowledge gaps, and to this end, the proposed project will employ a novel systems approach to determine the impact of genetic variation on circulating GDF11 levels and their effects on age-related cardiac hypertrophy. Our overarching hypothesis predicts that the GDF11 paradigm, wherein changes in GDF11 levels drive age-related cardiac hypertrophy, is strongly influenced by genetic factors. To test that hypothesis, we will use the revolutionary Diversity Outbred (DO) stock, and its eight founder strains, to address the following specific aims: 1) To validate the relationship between GDF11 and cardiac hypertrophy, and to test whether the relationship is dependent on genetic background; and 2) To define the genetic architecture of GDF11 levels using the DO, and to contrast the results against the genes that underlie cardiac hypertrophy. For each aim, we will use mass spectrometry to distinguish and quantify GDF11 and myostatin, enabling us to unambiguously differentiate between these proteins and to characterize the unique effects of GDF11 on age-related cardiac hypertrophy. These studies will reveal the underlying genetic contributors to circulating GDF11 levels, and the identification of novel genes will add critical and fresh insights into the fundamental biological pathways that couple advanced age and cardiac hypertrophy. Knowledge gained from these efforts will directly contribute to the ultimate goal of developing effective treatment strategies against age-related cardiovascular disease."
"9444639","PROJECT SUMMARY Immigrant groups in the United States have long experienced challenges to community inclusion and participation such as experiences of discrimination and victimization. Today, however, we are experiencing unprecedented levels of such experiences. For Somali young adults, who are black, Muslim immigrants, these experiences may be linked to their race, religion or migration status. This has been compounded by historical and recent events linked to aspects of Somali identity and culture creating a socio-historical moment in which young Somalis face an unprecedented threat of discrimination and mistreatment. While there is growing evidence on the adverse effect of discrimination on health, less is known about the experiences of immigrant groups and the ways in which discrimination and experiences of racism across multiple sectors of public life relate to mental health and well-being; what factors mediate these relationships; and how immigrants themselves understand and make meaning of these experiences as well as their relationships to their mental health and well-being. This mixed-methods, community partnered, proposal builds on a decade-long Community Based Participatory Research program led by Dr. Ellis, and partnered with Dr. Lincoln and Ms. Abdi, a team of inter-disciplinary researchers, and leaders from Somali communities. Through this community- research partnership our team has developed unprecedented datasets: to our knowledge, we have the largest longitudinal empirical database of psychosocial factors and Somali youth in the world. The broad goal of this project is to expand our knowledge of the relationships among experiences of discrimination and health outcomes for young Somali adults and thus contribute to a research trajectory aimed at developing strategies and interventions to disrupt these associations and mitigate disparities in mental health and health outcomes experienced by immigrant young adults. This will be accomplished through three specific aims which first test a theoretical model of the associations between multiple co-occurring experiences of discrimination (i.e. daily discrimination, life events discrimination, discrimination by teachers, and negative interaction with police) and mental health (symptoms of PTSD, anxiety and depression, and substance use) in Wave 1 of our existing data set. Next we propose to test whether the theoretical model explaining the associations between co-occurring forms of discrimination, social marginalization and mental health developed in Aim 1explains symptoms of mental illness over time using multiple waves of data. Finally, we propose to conduct additional qualitative interviews in three U.S. cities to explore Somali young adults? understanding of the health issues of concern to them and their communities, the ways they make meaning of experiences of discrimination and racism and how these relate to their health and well-being."
"9443764","Project Abstract Sub-optimal breastfeeding is associated with increased morbidly and mortality in low and middle-income countries. Mothers breastfeeding patterns are influenced by a variety of factors, which vary by context. Generally, these include upstream influences like workplace policies and facility-based initiatives, interpersonal influences like the availability peer-support, as well as individual-level influences such as mother's breastfeeding intentions and breastfeeding self-efficacy. The relationship between women's work and breastfeeding practices is unclear, especially in LMIC where employment is often informal and where workplace lactation-support policies may be less available. In Kenya, exclusive breastfeeding rate remain low, with only 40% of mothers EBF through 6 months, with the lowest rates among mothers employed in unskilled manual labor (4.5%). In Naivasha, Kenya there is a high level of maternal employment in commercial agriculture, mainly due to a large flower production industry, known as flori-culture. This study will 1) identify workplace, socio-demographic, and behavioral risk factors for sub-optimal breastfeeding; 2) describe barriers to successful implementation and use of existing maternity policies and assess the readiness to adopt BF- policies and support practices in workplaces; and 3) determine the impact of adopting BF-supportive policies and practices among mothers working in the flori-culture industry on women's productivity. These aims will collectively identify new testable interventions to improve the implementation and use of BF-support practices among working mothers, which will have generalizable impact to women's employment through LMIC, where maternal employment is rapidly increasing as economies evolve and more women enter the formal workforce."
"9418973","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  In order to move closer to achieving the goals of precision medicine and individualized cancer care, participation in biobanking from large numbers of individuals representing all ethnicities is essential. The scarcity of tissues available at existing biobanks from racial and ethnic minorities poses a substantial constraint to conducting research needed to understand the biological basis of health disparities. Because cancer- causing genetic alterations vary across individuals and ethnicities, the practice of precision medicine requires knowledge acquired through the study of tumor tissue derived from individuals representing diverse populations. It is important to recognize that Hispanic/Latino (H/L) ethnicity is an admixture of European, African, and Amerindians ancestral genomes, the proportions of which vary widely across individuals from different geographical regions. Also, there are differences in cancer trends associated to cancer biology and admixture genetics among different H/L sub-populations. Despite being a large proportion of the ethnic minorities living in the US, to date, there has been no comprehensive availability of tumor tissue from H/L cancer patients in national biobanks. To address this disparity, we propose to continue to develop the existing research infrastructure of the Puerto Rico Biobank (PRBB) to support research initiatives designed to understand the biological basis of cancer health disparities. The purpose of the PRBB is to facilitate the optimal collection, processing, storage, and distribution of well-annotated human biospecimens derived from the island?s H/L population for use in investigator-initiated translational cancer research. Throughout the past 10 years, a solid infrastructure has been put in place to develop this unique biorepository in Puerto Rico. Through this resource, fresh frozen tissues, paraffin blocks, high-quality tumor-derived RNA, genomic DNA, and clinical and risk factor information are available to support research at both institutions focusing on molecular aspects and determinants of cancer health disparities involving H/L living in Florida and Puerto Rico.  We propose to expand the existing Partnership?s biobank via three Specific Aims. In Aim 1 we propose to continue the collection, processing, storage, and distribution of biospecimens in collaboration with local hospitals and clinics. In cooperation with the Partnership?s Outreach Core, efforts to consent healthy individuals during community outreach educational activities will continue. In Aim 2, we propose to extend the documentation of demographic, clinical, pathological, and molecular data (?omic?, ancestry, next-gen sequence data) in collaboration with the Quantitative Sciences Core. In Aim 3, we propose to foster new collaborative research projects focused on cancer research. As facilitator of translational research, the PRBB is placed at the forefront of the Precision Medicine initiative programmatic goals of improving disease risk prediction and developing diagnosis and treatment strategies based on individual differences in genes, lifestyle, and environment, focusing on a population that is under-represented in biobanks and research."
"9334331","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Psychiatric comorbidities in epilepsy contribute significantly to the disease burden of epilepsy, a problem which is now increasingly recognized by clinicians, scientists, patient advocacy groups and the federal government. Indeed, 40% of patients with epilepsy suffer from stress-related psychopathologies such as anxiety and depression. Animal models of epilepsy corroborate clinical observations, evident as an array of depressive and anxiety-like phenotypes. Together these observations are suggestive of a common etiological mechanism that may influence disease progression of epilepsy itself and of its comorbidities. Recent clinical and preclinical evidence suggests that abnormalities in the stress system may contribute to epilepsy development and progression, as well as the development of psychiatric comorbidities. To date, however, very few mechanistic studies have been conducted to elucidate the relationship between stress hormone dysregulation and the development of epilepsy or its comorbidities.         Patients and animals with epilepsy exhibit chronic hyperactivity of the hypothalamic-pituitary­adrenocortical (HPA) axis, which regulates the stress response, resulting in chronically elevated glucocorticoids and over-activation of glucocorticoid receptors; a feature shared with major depression. Elevated glucocorticoids can damage neurons, increase brain excitability (pro-convulsant) and induce depressive symptoms in rodents and people. Thus we propose that HPA axis dysfunction in epilepsy contributes to disease progression and the development of psychiatric comorbidities. Our guiding hypothesis, therefore, is that the comorbid development of epilepsy and depression is mediated by chronic hyper-activation of the glucocorticoid stress receptor (GR).         We will test this hypothesis utilizing the well-characterized pilocarpine mouse model of temporal lobe epilepsy. In these animals, we will temporally and conditionally delete the glucocorticoid receptor in forebrain regions implicated in epilepsy and stress-regulation. We predict that such temporal and region-specific glucocorticoid receptor deletion will have disease modifying effects in epilepsy, evident as reduced seizures and reduced comorbid depressive-like behaviors. These studies will lay the groundwork for developing a mechanistic understanding of the relationship between stress and epilepsy, and will aid in the development of novel therapies."

"9384956","While insulin?s effects in the periphery has been studied extensively, insulin?s effects on neural function in the adult brain are poorly understood. Infusion of insulin directly into the brain reduces food intake in rodents, and intranasal insulin reduces food intake in humans, though the mechanism(s) of this effect is unknown (Brown et al. 2006; Benedict et al., 2008; Figlewicz et al. 2006). In addition, insulin decreases excitatory transmission onto dopamine neurons in adult rodents (Labouebe et al. 2013; Liu et al., 2013) and enhances dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens (NAc; Stouffer et al., 2015). However, no studies have examined insulin?s effects on neurotransmission in brain circuits that influence feeding in lean or obese individuals. Our objective is to determine how insulin regulates excitatory glutamatergic transmission in the NAc in the normal and obese state. The NAc influences both the initiation of feeding and the consumption of food through regulation of distinct sub-circuits (Kelley, 2004; Everitt and Robbins, 2005; Figlewicz and Sipols, 2010). For example, increases in excitatory transmission in the NAc core increases food-seeking (Brown et al., 2015), whereas decreases in the NAc shell can induce feeding (Maldonado-Irizarry et al., 1995; Peters and Kalivas, 2006). Excitatory drive to the NAc is provided by glutamatergic inputs from several brain regions including the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC; Ding et al., 2001) and disruption of these inputs perturbs feeding (Land et al., 2014). Our preliminary data show that insulin bi-directionally influences excitatory transmission in the NAc. However, the mechanism underlying this effect is unknown. Furthermore, in obese rats, insulin receptor-induced increases in excitatory transmission are absent. This is consistent with the idea that obesity produces central insulin resistance. We will combine electrophysiology, biochemical and optogenetic approaches in normal and obese rats to determine the mechanisms by which insulin modulates glutamatergic transmission in the NAc, and will examine the specific role of prefrontal cortical inputs to the NAc in effects of insulin."
"9418741","Over the past six years, the Research Insights series, funded through an initial AHRQ conference grant in 2010, has successfully provided a unique forum to identify and examine evidence related to health care costs, financing, and organization and to highlight potentially researchable topics where the evidence base is lacking. Participant evaluations document that these meetings and associated materials have been useful to the policy ?intermediaries? who advise decision makers. For the continuation of the Research Insights series, we place even greater emphasis on innovation through webinar methods of convening and dissemination via blog posts and social media to extend the meeting discussions beyond the meeting participants. The continuation of this partnership between AcademyHealth and AHRQ will augment their respective efforts to support the creation of rigorous, timely research and disseminate findings to decision makers. Continuation of the Research Insights series will retain and expand the innovative features honed over the last six years to: 1) build upon the sentinel mechanism established during the first six years of the meeting series to identify current and emerging policy issues concerning health care costs, organization, markets and productivity; 2) identify the most current, well-done research on these content areas supported by all major funders of such work; 3) create opportunities for dialogue among researchers and policymakers about the implications and limitations of relevant existing research findings; and 4) extend meeting discussion beyond meeting participants to key stakeholder audiences by utilizing virtual convening, blog posts, and social media. The heart of the Research Insights project will be the one invitational meeting of up to 40 participants and one open webinar on a related topic to be held each year of the grant. We anticipate holding the in-person meetings in February, March or April of each year (2018-2020) and their associated webinars will follow two to three months later, in conjunction with the release of the meeting issue brief. A Project Advisory Committee (PAC) will meet in October of each year to identify and prioritize meeting topics based on: 1) current policy relevance; 2) availability of relevant evidence from research; and 3) gaps in previous dissemination efforts. Members of the PAC will also advise staff about the agenda, suggested moderator and speakers, and invitations for each meeting. Meeting participants will include federal and state policymakers, intermediaries and leading expert researchers. AHRQ Priority Populations will be emphasized through meeting topic selection and targeted research presentations. Each meeting will result in an issue brief and an AcademyHealth blog post, and we will make webinar recordings publicly available through our website. AcademyHealth will continue to evaluate the grant using participant surveys, internet statistics, and feedback from the PAC, and we will also survey meeting participants following the meeting when we release the issue brief to better measure the impact and outcomes of the meeting and its related materials on participants."
"9552298","Abstract: Chronic pain represents an immense clinical problem, with over 100 million Americans afflicted and an annual price tag exceeding half a trillion dollars, according to a recent report from the Institute of Medicine. Studies in our lab are designed to identify molecular, cellular, and circuit mechanisms of sensitization in pain pathways with the goal of identifying novel targets for analgesic intervention. Studies performed under the three previous terms of this grant identified a critical signaling cascade in central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA) neurons that underlies central pain sensitization. This pathway is initiated by metabotropic glutamate receptor subtype 5 (mGlu5) activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase/ERK signaling, leading to increased firing of CeA neurons. This increase in excitability likely contributes to central sensitization associated with persistent pain. Our prior work, and that of several other groups, has demonstrated robust analgesic actions of mGlu5 antagonists in a variety of animal models of pain. In the previous round of funding of this award, our group subsequently found that mGlu5 antagonists also reduce pain in humans. We found that although mGlu5 activation is important at multiple points along the pain neuraxis, selective blockade of mGlu5 in the CeA or conditional knockout of mGlu5 in CeA neurons produces profound analgesia. These findings suggest that mGlu5 expressing neurons in the CeA represent a critical node of neuromodulation underlying the development of chronic pain. In the present application, we conduct a series of studies aimed at understanding circuit context of these neurons, identifying critical inputs, the type of plasticity that occurs at these synapses, and the major outputs of mGlu5-expresing CeA neurons. We will test whether CeA neurons activated in the context of pain sensitization are necessary and sufficient for the development of pain sensitization, ongoing pain and negative valence, and comorbid anxiety. In vivo 2-photon imaging and microendoscope cameras will be used to monitor activity of these neurons using the genetically-encoded Ca2+ sensor GCaMP6m, over days to weeks to determine how the properties of these neurons change during the transition from acute to persistent pain. We will ask whether the population of neurons responsive to heat, cold, or touch change over time, and whether altered activity of these neurons in persistent pain conditions can be normalized using treatments that reduce pain or comorbid anxiety. These studies employ a host of modern techniques including advanced viral tracing, genetic trapping, intravital calcium imaging, and optogenetic approaches, together with technologies developed in our lab for wireless optogenetic studies to address these important questions."
"9538983","Project Summary: Dry eye (DE), characterized by a myriad of signs (e.g. decreased tear production, increased evaporation, and inflammation) and symptoms (e.g. pain, blurry vision and dryness), is a debilitating disease that affects quality of life. Many patients have persistent symptoms, because the available clinical therapies are not adequate to manage DE. Thus, managing DE requires solutions (i.e. beyond individual- level clinical interventions). An emerging literature suggests that environmental conditions can contribute to the onset and persistence of DE. Our microenvironment is a complex mixture of particulate matter (PM), gaseous air pollutants and allergens. However, individual specific data on microenvironment are not available. The project will test two novel hypotheses: 1) the clinical manifestations, measured by the types and severity of different measures of DE, vary with respect to types, levels and sources of air pollutants, allergens, humidity and temperature, specifically, exposure to PM, bioaerosols and gaseous pollutants is associated with epithelial disruption (ED), inflammation and evaporative tear deficiency (ETD), respectively; 2) DE signs are more strongly associated with indoor relative to outdoor air pollution, as we spend more time indoors and our indoor exposure dominates our total exposure to microenvironmental conditions. To test these hypotheses, we propose a prospective case-control design. We will recruit 360 subjects from Bascom Palmer Eye Institute (BPEI), ranked as the number 1 eye institute in the US consecutively for the past 12 years, and University of Maryland Ophthalmology ? Redwood (UMOR) clinics. 180 cases and age-, gender- and race/ethnicity-matched 180 controls will be determined after their clinical exams. Subjects who meet the inclusion criteria and have at least one of the three measures of DE, namely ED, inflammation, and ETD, will serve as cases, and controls will be free from these DE signs, and will meet inclusion criteria. Each subject will undergo four clinical exams one in each of the four seasons, and a weeklong intensive air pollution monitoring inside and outside their homes before the clinical exam. PRECISE (precise.ccs.miami.edu), our portable battery of direct-reading sensors, will measure air pollution in each subject's home for one full year. Over the same week, participants will record DE symptoms through web or phone. We will calculate time- weighted indoor and outdoor exposures, and model the effects of exposure on DE signs and symptoms using spatial econometric models. Our interdisciplinary team has the state-of-the-art laboratory facilities for clinical assessment of DE and exposure assessment as well as a collaborative track-record over four years. This project will generate knowledge that will potentially provide a new line of home-based environmental treatment to manage DE. This research aligns with the ?ocular infection, inflammation and immunology? priority areas of the National Eye Institute (NEI).    "
"9345300","The gut microbiota is an integrated part of human biology and has coevolved with us, passing from generation to generation for millions of years. Therefore, the species that are likely to have biology most compatible with the human genome are specific and not a random collection that we can assemble from the surrounding environment and let the prevailing selective forces shape. The plasticity of the gut microbiota offers tremendous potential for therapeutic manipulation, but this malleability can translate into species-loss during perturbations like those that have accompanied industrialization. The microbiota of people living a Western lifestyle differs substantially from that of traditional populations whose lifestyles are relatively free of the forces of modernization. These ?traditional? microbiotas contain taxa that are common to traditional populations on different continents yet are absent or exceedingly rare among people in the industrialized world. This project aims to understand the species and genes that define and differentiate the microbiome of traditional populations. A primary goal of this research is to pursue a deep biological understanding of how compositional and functional differences between the traditional microbiota and Western microbiota affect human biology. Using existing de-identified archived stool samples from hunter-gatherers, a variety of tools will be applied including deep metagenomic sequencing, isolation and characterization of microbial species that are absent or rare in the Western gut, gnotobiotic mouse models, and molecular genetics. This study will result in an important, novel understanding of the human microbiome, one that addresses the fundamental question of what defines the microbiomes that our species evolved with. Investigating the microbiome from an evolutionary perspective will yield insight into how missing components of our biology may be complemented via gut microbiota colonization. This approach will significantly contribute to preventing and treating a spectrum of non-communicable chronic diseases."
"9440250","Abstract Key to all healthcare services, confidentially is particularly important in the delivery of sexual health services (SHS) to adolescents ? a group that is simultaneously learning to use healthcare systems, to negotiate the new terrain of intimate relationships, and to renegotiate boundaries with parents. While a small literature has examined the impact of legal guarantees for confidentiality on adolescent healthcare use, little is known about parents? roles in fostering adolescents? transitions regarding the use of health care. Likewise, the role of providers in helping adolescents negotiate health care transitions has been poorly explored. The proposed project (CASH: Confidential Adolescent Sexual Health services) aims to examine the provision of confidential sexual health services to adolescents ages 11-17 years. This project would build upon the strengths of the University of Minnesota Prevention Research Center (UMN PRC; PI Sieving) in understanding the intersection of adolescent development, health care systems, and sexual health, and extend the work of the Adolescent Health Consortium project (PIs Klein and Santelli, in collaboration with the American Academy of Pediatrics) which is currently examining private time and confidentiality in the delivery of clinical preventive services to older adolescents and young adults. Grounded in our collective expertise, the CASH project will explore nuances and barriers to provision of confidential SHS to adolescents from the perspectives of adolescents, parents and providers. We would investigate the importance of private time and confidentiality in the receipt of screening, counseling, and services around sexual and reproductive health. Aim 1 would identify barriers and facilitators to confidential SHS for adolescents through in-depth qualitative interviews with providers, parents, and adolescents (11-17 years) in four counties in Minnesota. We would sample 24 primary care providers -- pediatricians, family physicians, and nurse practitioners working in urban and rural counties and in areas with higher and lower rates of adolescent pregnancy, as well as 48 sets of adolescents and parents from providers? practices. Aim 2 would explore regional variations in perspectives of primary care providers regarding private time, confidentiality, and SHS for adolescents through 8 focus groups with a national sample of pediatricians, family physicians and nurse practitioners (n=80 primary care providers). Aim 3 would document prevalence of adolescents? receipt of developmentally-appropriate SHS (e.g., screening, education, counseling, and services such as vaccines, condoms, contraception, and pre-exposure prophylaxis) through an internet survey (NIS) with a national probability sample of adolescent/parent dyads (n=1000 dyads). The NIS would also explore attitudes, motivations, barriers and facilitators to quality SHS. The proposed research will result in recommendations for improving delivery of adolescent SHS -- including messages for adolescents, parents, and providers; and ways for restructuring health care systems to facilitate the delivery of quality SHS."
"9396625","Project Summary/Abstract: Excessive ethanol consumption affects 18 million Americans and is the fourth leading cause of preventable death in the United States. An important consequence of chronic alcohol abuse that continues to be a major public health burden is alcoholic liver disease (ALD), which consists of a spectrum of disorders that includes hepatic steatosis, alcoholic hepatitis, fibrosis, cirrhosis, and potentially hepatocellular carcinoma. Few new therapies exist to address the liver injury and inflammation in ALD, and the prognosis for patients remains poor. Cell death of hepatocytes has been recognized to play an important part in the development of ALD. Apoptosis is a key driver in fibrosis, but inhibition of apoptosis is not sufficient to prevent ethanol-induced hepatocyte injury or expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines in mouse models. Recent research has pointed towards a role for necroptosis, a more pro-inflammatory mode of cell death, in ethanol-induced liver injury. Previous work in our lab has been published showing increased RIP3 expression in livers from patients with ALD and that RIP3 necroptosis in mice drives ethanol-induced increases in ALT, AST, and hepatic inflammation. While much progress has been made into the molecular mechanisms, not as much is known about the cellular basis of these pathways in alcohol-induced liver injury, yet progression of ALD involves complex interactions of non-parenchymal and parenchymal cells. This work in this proposal focuses on Kupffer cells, the liver-resident macrophages that are sensitized to gut- derived endotoxin during chronic ethanol exposure and are a major source of reactive oxygen species and inflammatory mediator production leading to liver damage. The overall goal of this proposal is to understand the roles and regulation of programmed cell death in Kupffer cells in alcohol-induced liver injury through two specific aims using in vivo and cell culture models. Specific Aim 1 will determine the role of RIP3 expression and necroptosis in myeloid cells versus hepatocytes in liver injury under chronic ethanol feeding. Specific Aim 2 will identify mechanisms of differential sensitivity of Kupffer cells to programmed cell death in ALD. These studies will provide useful insight into roles of and mechanisms affecting programmed cell death in Kupffer cells that lead to the progression of ALD."

"9312668","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Together, physical inactivity and poor diet make up the second leading modifiable cause of death in the US. Racial disparities in these behaviors and associated health outcomes present major public health challenges. The specific aims of the USC PRC for 2014-2019 build on a long and successful history of applied research and practice in underserved communities: 1) grow the Center infrastructure; 2) engage communities, state and local health departments, and other stakeholders to inform our activities; 3) implement an integrated set of strategies to disseminate Center research findings, products, and programs; 4) contribute to the development of skilled community members and public health professionals through training and technical assistance; 5) evaluate Center activities and outcomes; and 6) conduct an applied public health prevention research project. Achievement of these aims will lead to the following long-term outcomes: 1) increased translation of research into practice and policy; 2) improved environmental and system-wide strategies; 3) widespread use of evidence-based programs and policies; 4) enhanced community capacity for health promotion and disease prevention; 5) increased skilled public health professionals and community members; 6) expanded resources for applied public health research; and 7) increased recognition of and support for USC PRC research and activities. The USC PRC's applied research project will study the dissemination and implementation of an evidence-based program shown previously to significantly increase physical activity and fruit and vegetable intake in churches in South Carolina (Faith, Activity, and Nutrition; FAN). Guided by two theoretical frameworks, the specific aims of the applied research project are to: 1) examine the adoption and reach of FAN in churches and organizational factors associated with adoption; 2) characterize implementation fidelity and multilevel factors associated with implementation; 3) describe organizational maintenance of FAN and factors associated with maintenance; and 4) study the effectiveness of FAN. In Phase 1, we will randomize churches in a rural county with a high proportion of African American residents to receive training in FAN from a community health advisor (n=40) or to be part of a delayed intervention control group (n=20). This phase will allow us to study dissemination and implementation in a range of diverse religious denominations and gain greater understanding of how local coalitions can reach faith-based communities as settings for intervention. In Phase 2, we will work with two large faith denominations in SC, including one that is predominantly African American, to disseminate the program statewide. This phase will allow us to identify key considerations in program dissemination, adoption, and implementation and to examine the potential for broader geographic dissemination. Increasing physical activity and fruit and vegetable consumption are important goals of the CDC's Winnable Battles and the National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion's environmental approach to preventing chronic disease and promoting health."

"9351516","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Explicating the neurobiological basis of cognitive functions such as visual short term memory has been a long standing goal of scientific research because it is essential for understanding normal cognitive functions and treating brain disorders that can devastate the ability to think and act. The proposed experiments will investigate the role of two brain areas, the posterior parietal and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in cognitive functions, relying on a non-human primate model. We will comparatively investigate the single-neuron and population responses in these two areas, with respect to visual short-term memory capacity, the influence of each brain area to memory involved behavior, and their functional plasticity as a result of training in short term memory tasks. These studies will help unveil the functional specialization of cortical areas involved in higher cognitive functions and offer insighs on normal cognitive processing as well as the consequences of brain injury and mental illness."
"9215369","PROJECT SUMMARY Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a rare orphan disease in the United States (US), affecting approximately 100,000 people in the US. SCD is characterized by severe vaso-occlusive disease, resulting in endothelial cell dysfunction, chronic organ damage, poor health-related quality of life (HRQL) and early mortality. The only known curative therapy for patients with high-risk SCD is allogeneic stem cell transplantation (AlloSCT) from an unaffected HLA-matched sibling donor (MSD). However, only 15% of high-risk patients with SCD have such donors. In the last grant cycle we successfully demonstrated the safety and feasibility of familial haploidentical (FHI) AlloSCT utilizing CD34 enrichment and CD3 (T cell) addback after myeloimmunoablative conditioning (MIAC) in children and adolescents (IND#14359) (5R01FD004090) (NCT61461837). During that grant cycle the CD34 enrichment methodology utilizing the CliniMACS® technology was approved by the FDA, in part due to the results of this investigation. Limitations of this approach include: 1) lack of safety data in young adults with high-risk SCD; 2) high risk of transplant-related mortality secondary to endothelial dysfunction and sinusoidal obstructive syndrome (SOS); and 3) potential for long-term toxicity, especially infertility. Defibrotide is a mixture of polydisperse oligonucleotides that targets small vessel endothelium with antithrombotic and fibrinolytic activity. Defibrotide is approved in Europe, but not the US, and has been demonstrated to reduce mortality significantly in patients who have develop severe SOS post-MIAC AlloSCT. Our FHI AlloSCT SCD consortium (www.sicklecelltransplantconsortium.org) has obtained a new IND (127812) to investigate the safety, feasibility and efficacy of defibrotide prophylaxis prior to and during MIAC and FHI AlloSCT utilizing CD34 enrichment and T cell addback in children, adolescents and young adults with high-risk SCD. The specific aims include (brief): 1) assess safety, toxicity and efficacy of defibrotide prophylaxis to prevent severe SOS; 2) investigate safety and efficacy of decreasing the dose of cyclophosphamide in the MIAC by 50%; 3) identify new endothelial biomarkers and methods of non-invasive hepatic imaging associated with SOS; 4) determine the incidence of late effects in the current and two new cohorts, with a focus on fertility preservation; 5) determine the probability of acute and chronic GVHD, and levels of whole blood and RBC-enriched donor chimerism, and cellular immune reconstitution; 6) estimate changes in pulmonary, cardiovascular and pulmonary vascular function; and 7) characterize changes in neuroimaging, neurocognitive function and HRQL. The long-term objectives are to obtain sufficient data to contribute to FDA approval of defibrotide prophylaxis to prevent severe SOS in high-risk patients with SCD, facilitate this successful therapeutic approach to at-risk young adults with SCD, reduce the dose of cyclophosphamide by 50% in the MIAC regimen and maintain robust hematopoietic and cellular immune reconstitution, donor chimerism, low risk of acute and chronic GVHD and a robust EFS/OS in patients with high-risk SCD without an HLA MSD."
"9530725","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): As the number of older adults in the United States increases over the next 50 years, it is imperative that we understand not only those factors that are associated with limitations in functioning, but also those that are associated with maintained functioning and well-being. Recent research suggests that engagement in cognitively demanding activities is beneficial in terms of preserving cognitive health. For example, there is evidence that older adults who engage in social, leisure, and work-related activities that place demands on cognitive resources are more likely to maintain their intellectual competence over longer periods of time than those who do not engage in such activities. Given this relationship and the potential significance for public health issues, it is important to understand the factors associated with continued participation in cognitively demanding activities later in life. Of interst is the fact that certain characteristics of the individual that might be expected to predict participation and level of performance, such as ability, do not account for substantial variance between individuals in participation. In the present project, we investigate the strong possibility  that age-related changes in motivation play a critical role in determining participation in demanding everyday activities, with perceived benefits and costs of engagement guiding decisions regarding participation. In the proposed research, we hypothesize that normative increases with age in the physical costs associated with cognitive activity-as indexed by cardiovascular responses-affect this benefit/cost analysis, with reductions in participation in later life related to increased costs. We also propose, however, that perceptions of the self- relevance of the task as well as one's beliefs about aging may also influence perceptions of benefits and costs. For example, negative perceptions about the impact of aging on ability may lead an individual to exaggerate the perceived costs of activities, thereby exacerbating the impact of costs on participation. Conversely, if an individual believes an activity is self-relevan (e.g., beneficial to cognitive health), motivation may be affected through adjustments in perceived benefits. Importantly, both self-relevance and beliefs about aging are potentially modifiable, which has implications for the development of effective interventions. Motivational factors have been relatively neglected in the study of cognitive aging. They may, however, play a critical role in determining late-life functioning and well-being. The proposed research will systematically explore (a) how normative age differences in the costs associated with cognitive activity influence motivation and subsequent activity participation, and (b) the factors that moderate this relationship."
"9466573","Project Summary Negative symptoms such as reductions in motivation and goal-oriented behavior have long been considered a key feature of psychotic disorders (e.g., bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder). These symptoms are detrimental to social and occupational functioning because decreases in motivation may impair work productivity and social relationships. However, treatments for psychotic disorders (e.g., antipsychotic medications) have proven largely ineffective at reducing negative symptom severity in psychotic patients, in part due to poor understanding of the mechanisms that give rise to these symptoms. The current project aims to examine one potential mechanism, which might contribute to motivational impairment in psychotic disorders, aberrant effort allocation. More specifically, patients with psychotic disorders may overestimate the ?cost? of the effort necessary to pursue goals, and due to this elevated ?cost? may fail to initiate actions to obtain goals. Supporting this hypothesis, research shows that patients with psychosis (schizophrenia and schizoaffective) are less motivated than controls to exert both physical and cognitive effort to obtain rewards on experimental tasks, and that this task deficit is related to negative symptoms. However, despite strong behavioral evidence for abnormal effort-cost computation in psychotic disorders, studies have not examined the neural correlates of this deficit. Such studies may ultimately inform novel biological targets for future interventions by linking biological mechanisms to emerging basic science frameworks that have delineated the biological pathways that give rise to effortful choice. The current proposal addresses this ?gap? in the literature by examining the neural correlates of effort-based decision-making in psychosis (schizophrenia and schizoaffective) using fMRI and a well-validated effort-based decision-making paradigm. Further, the current proposal aims to directly examine the relationship between aberrant effort-based decision-making and daily emotional experience. Specifically, we propose to examine daily levels of self-reported motivation as subjects go about there daily lives and quantify whether these measures relate to effort-based decision-making measured in the lab. This approach of relating experimental findings to real-world function is rare in the literature. Thus, this proposal fills a much-needed ?gap? between our mechanistic understanding of effort-based decision-making and the impact of such dysfunction on the daily lives of those with and without psychopathology. The long-term objectives of this project contribute to public health by examining a potential contributory mechanism for a widely distressing and poorly treated aspect of psychotic disorders. Ultimately, such findings may inform novel biological targets for future interventions and preventive approaches."
"9256245","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of our work is to elucidate the cellular and molecular mechanisms by which cell-surface receptors regulate the function, trafficking, and expression of ion channels. We are particularly interested in receptor regulation of ion channels in pain transduction, as sensitization to painful stimuli during inflammation (inflammatory hyperalgesia) profoundly influences our physical and mental health, as well as our economic and social well-being. We have chosen the Ca2+-permeable channel TRPV1 as our model both because its properties make it especially suitable and because of its importance in transducing painful stimuli and in tuning the excitability of pain-transducing neurons. Chronic pain is a significant public health and economic problem in the US. An analysis of the 2003 American Productivity Audit, a national survey of US workers, showed that, in a given two-week period, 13% of the workforce lost work time due to uncontrolled pain, with a mean loss of 4.6 hours per week. The 2003 National Center for Health Statistics Report found that 26% of adults report having a problem with pain lasting more than 24 hours. A 2006 study of chronic pain patients found that more than half felt they had little or no control over their pain. Headache, back pain, arthritis pain, tooth pain, cancer pain, and post-operative pain are just a few of the common conditions contributing to decreased quality of life and economic loss across the whole spectrum of the US population. Current treatments are clearly not sufficient to address the wide-spread need for pain relief, and have further problems related to specificity and addiction. Nerve Growth Factor (NGF) was discovered by Rita Levi-Montalcini and Stanley Cohen in the late 1950's. From the first, they understood its power to regulate the differentiation and growth of sensory neurons. NGF is involved in the guidance and survival of sensory neurons and is released onto TRPV1-expressing neurons during injury and inflammation. Our understanding of how NGF sensitizes TRPV1 in inflammatory hyperalgesia exploded in the last several years. In the previous funding period we showed that NGF increases TRPV1 currents by increasing the number of the TRPV1 channels in the plasma membrane. We further showed that a signal-transduction complex is present in nociceptors, composed of the NGF receptor (TrkA), TRPV1, and the enzyme PI3K, which phosphorylates phosphoinositide 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) to phosphoinositide 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3). We and others further showed that PI3K activity is required for sensitization. For the remainder of this proposal use the term sensitization of TRPV1 to refer to the increase in the number of TRPV1 channels in the plasma membrane. Although cell surface receptor-stimulated trafficking of membrane lipids and membrane proteins is of broad significance to biology, the molecular mechanisms by which it occurs are poorly understood. One of the best-studied examples, trafficking of the Glut4 glucose transporter to the plasma membrane of adipocytes and muscle cells in response to insulin, has revealed a number of important players on which we based our model for NGF-induced trafficking of TRPV1 to the plasma membrane of pain-receptor neurons. Even in adipocytes and muscles, however, many critical steps in this process are not fully understood. Identification of the main players and their interactions in sensitization of TRPV1 may shed light on a signaling pathway essential to cell differentiation, metabolism, and survival in addition to leading to an understanding of TRPV1 regulation important for inflammatory pain."
"9419641","Project Summary/Abstract  Polypharmacy among older adults is common and increases the likelihood of being prescribed and harmed by high-risk medications. To date, efforts to reduce the rate of high-risk polypharmacy have had limited uptake due to their expense per clinician and their modest effectiveness in helping clinicians stop potentially inappropriate medications. These prior efforts have relied on rational models of clinician behavior. However, like people in general, clinicians are susceptible to irrational biases and cognitive shortcuts that might perpetuate inappropriate high-risk polypharmacy. Therefore behavioral economic nudges, which do not assume rational decision making, might be well-positioned to reduce such high-risk polypharmacy. Moreover, such nudges can be embedded in electronic health records (EHRs), enhancing their scalability at a low cost per clinician?as long as they are acceptable to clinicians who worry about EHRs' effects on their workflows.  The overall objectives of the project are to develop EHR-based behavioral economic nudges that reduce the prevalence and degree of high-risk polypharmacy among older adult patients, to test their effectiveness, and to describe their impact on clinicians' experiences and workflows. To do this, we will complete an R21 planning phase, followed by an R33 implementation phase. The specific aims of the 2-year R21 planning phase are (1) to specify, implement, and validate measures of high-risk polypharmacy within the Northwestern University EHR and (2) to develop and pilot two nudges within the Northwestern EHR (a commitment nudge and a justification nudge). The specific aims of the 3-year R33 implementation phase are (3) to refine the nudges within the Northwestern EHR and implement the nudges and high-risk polypharmacy measures within the Sutter Health EHR, (4) to evaluate the effects of each EHR-based nudge on measures of high-risk polypharmacy via randomized controlled trial, and (5) to assess qualitatively clinician experiences with the EHR-based nudges, including their acceptability and effects on workflow.  To accomplish the R21 aims, our multidisciplinary team of researchers experienced in designing EHR- based measures of medication appropriateness and behavioral economic nudges will use the Northwestern EHR as a development and testing lab. After assessing their feasibility, we will (in the R33 phase) finalize both nudges and conduct an 18-month cluster randomized trial in which we randomize approximately 300 Northwestern and Sutter clinics across to receive 0, 1, or 2 nudges in a 2 x 2 factorial design. In the final project year we will conduct semi-structured interviews with approximately 40 clinicians to describe their experiences with the nudges in detail. The study will yield EHR-based nudges that can be implemented across the country, detailed descriptions of how these nudges affect clinicians' workflows, and scientific papers documenting the nudges' effectiveness in reducing high-risk polypharmacy among older adults."
"9335671","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Background: Alterations in cognitive/affective/sleep functioning are among the most challenging side effects experienced by 80% of patients with metastatic melanoma (MM) or metastatic renal cell carcinoma (MRCC) undergoing high dose Interleukin-2 (IL-2) therapy.1 Altered cognition2 includes a wide array of symptoms such as alterations in concentration, attention, short-term memory, confusion, mental fatigue, executive functioning, abstraction, language, basic arithmetic and orientation;3,4 affective symptoms2 include mood alterations, depression, anxiety, psychosis, hallucinations, aggression, suicide ideation and coma;5-7 and sleep symptoms include insomnia (initial, middle, delayed) and hypersomnia.8  Methods: This exploratory, descriptive, mixed methods case study design will describe the trajectory of transient and residual cognitive/affective/sleep symptoms in ten high-dose IL-2 cases. Each IL-2 case consists of the IL-2 patient, care partner, and primary nurse. Through case study analyses, qualitative data from the care partner and nurse will be synthesized with qualitative and quantitative data from the patient to inform and describe the patterns of cognitive/affective/sleep symptoms experienced by the patient during treatment.  The specific aims of this study are to: Aim 1) Describe transient and residual cognitive (language, concentration, confusion, attention, short-term memory, and orientation), affective (depression, anxiety, mood alterations), and sleep (insomnia, hypersomnia) symptoms in patients during up to four hospitalizations for high-dose IL-2 therapy. Aim 2) Describe patient transient and residual cognitive/affective/sleep symptoms as qualitatively reported by each patient's care partner, and primary nurse during each hospital admission for IL-2 therapy. Aim 3) Describe the trajectory of transient and residual cognitive/affective/sleep symptoms in IL-2 patients over the total number of hospitalizations, synthesizing patient data with care partner and nurse reports of symptom change.  Significance: This will be the first study to describe IL-2-induced cognitive/affective/sleep symptoms longitudinally from the perspective of the individuals experiencing the treatment course: the patient, their care partner, and their nurse. These individuals will describe the trajectory, duration and severity of these symptoms through journaling, interviews, and cognitive/affective/sleep measures. Results from this study will identify critical time points along the symptom trajectory to target interventions. These data will inform future interventional studies that help patients during periods of aggressive medical treatment, supporting their care partners, and nurses."
"9312114","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Rates of physically forced sex to dating violence remain high in college communities (22% of 10,000 female undergraduates disclosed these forms of violence against women (VAW) in the past 12 months (2010-2013).  Bystander interventions, recognized as promising violence prevention strategies, are unique in their engagement of all community members to 1) recognize situations that may become violent and 2) learn to safely and effectively intervene to reduce violence risk.  Based on their promise, the Campus Sexual Violence Elimination Act (SaVE) now requires all publicly-funded college to provide bystander intervention.  With SaVE's policy intervention requiring bystander intervention, a natural experiment has arisen to determine the relative efficacy of students' bystander training across multiple colleges.  We propose a quasi-experimental design with fractional factorials to evaluate the relative efficacy of bystander interventions components to reduce violence in college communities.  Green Dot will be one of the bystander intervention components evaluated because our group has considerable experience rigorously evaluating Green Dot and we have recently found that this bystander intervention is associated with a 20-40% reduction in VAW in college and high school settings.  Aim 1.  Compare the relative efficacy of bystander interventions to 1) increase bystander efficacy and behaviors, 2) reduce violence acceptance, 3) reduce violence victimization and perpetration, and 4) increase program cost effectiveness.  The three primary bystander groups compared will be:  a) exclusively online training, Green Dot (speeches and intensive bystander training), and other skills-based by stander training.  Program efficacy data will be obtained from student surveys, campus crime statistics, and surveys with college staff and administrators responsible for selecting and implementing bystander interventions.  We will collect data at each college for the full 4 years of the project (~50,000 students annually.  Infrastructure provided by the Kentucky Center for Clinical and Translational Science at the University of Kentucky and West Virginia University will support a VAW Research Coordinating Center for all electronic data collection and analyses from 24 recruited colleges, comparing the different bystander interventions.  VAW researchers draw from multiple disciplines yet few training programs support this diverse field of highly relevant applied research.  Thus, we seek to grow communities of VAW prevention researchers.  Researcher communities will form through researcher' engagement with college recruitment, survey design, data collection and analyses.  Aim 2.  Determine the efficacy of this program to increase VAW prevention research productivity defined as 1) increasing research skills and 2) increasing research communities measured as manuscript submissions, presentations, and publications.  This natural experiment will generate new understanding of how and what bystander components work to prevent violence.  It will also provide the VAW research community an opportunity to increase our skill-sets and share our experiences with and help grow the next generation of VAW prevention researchers."
"9561619","Project Summary Efficient cognitive processing relies on the brain?s ability to engage in prediction and to use forward modeling to anticipate cognitive events, including during language processing. The central goal of this proposal is to test two competing hypotheses concerning how age influences prediction during auditory and visual language processing. Current evidence is contradictory and sparse, reflecting the need for systematic investigation. The project has three Specific Aims: Aim1: Determine whether older adults predict words in manipulated sentence contexts less or more than younger adults do by examining prediction during reading, using both electrophysiology (EEG) and eyetracking methods. Aim2: Determine whether, during spoken language processing, older adults predict words in manipulated sentence contexts less or more than younger adults do, using EEG and Visual World eyetracking methods. Spoken language processing merits targeted investigation because evidence suggests older adults have specific problems with auditory input. Moreover, in the young adult literature on prediction in language processing, relatively few studies have focused on spoken language, so little is known about whether prediction differs in the two modalities. Aim3: Determine whether older adults predict upcoming words in connected passages less or more than younger adults do, using fixation-related fMRI and EEG methods in reading, with prediction assessed by continuous measures of lexical surprisal and entropy. Surprisal and entropy measures permit the investigation of more naturally varying levels of predictability, more natural distributions of predictable and less predictable information, and allow the investigation of how natural texts (i.e., stimuli not specifically created for an experiment) are comprehended. Innovations: The project is innovative in (1) the use of converging eyetracking, EEG, and fMRI methods to systematically evaluate the extent of prediction during older adults' language comprehension, emphasizing replication across techniques and modalities; (2) the use of continuously varying surprisal/entropy in connected text to index age differences in prediction; (3) the use of a novel technique developed by PI Henderson, Fixation-Related fMRI, to relate neural activation to word-by-word surprisal and entropy during natural reading. Significance: The experiments will yield high temporal resolution information about prediction in older adults during online reading and spoken comprehension, together with detailed information about the neural bases of prediction operations. The findings have important implications for theories of normal cognitive aging. Translational significance: A psychometrically valid assessment of everyday language skills will be used to evaluate the relationship between prediction skills and a measure that has been shown to predict impairments associated with Alzheimer?s disease. Overall, prediction in language processing is potentially a model system for enhancing our scientific understanding of how cognitive and neural decline associated with aging trades off against greater knowledge and experience."

"9285634","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Mitochondrial biogenesis is a target of many aging interventions. While the induction of mitochondrial biogenesis is generally thought to be beneficial, our data indicate that activating mitochondrial biogenesis at old age drives the intracellular accumulation of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) deletion mutations and results in an 18% loss of muscle fibers and a 1,200% increase in electron transport chain (ETC) deficient muscle fiber segments. These effects were antagonistically pleiotropic; they were not observed in treated young rats. Based on our data, up-regulation of mitochondrial biogenesis in aged humans may cause significant skeletal muscle damage. These studies will clarify the role of mitochondrial biogenesis in mtDNA deletion mutation accumulation and evaluate the old-age specific effects of compounds that stimulate mitochondrial biogenesis in skeletal muscle. Project outcomes: · Specify the cellular pathways and ages at which inducing mitochondrial biogenesis increases mtDNA  deletion mutation frequency, ETC deficiencies and fiber loss. · Infer the causality of mitochondrial biogenesis in fiber loss by specifying the order of events and time  required between mitochondrial biogenesis, mtDNA deletion mutation accumulation and cell death. · Determine whether other AMPK or peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor agonists, which target  mitochondrial biogenesis, also induce deletion mutation accumulation and cell death when initiated at old ages. · Downregulate mitochondrial biogenesis in old rats to prevent ETC deficiencies and fiber loss. By understanding the mechanisms and impacts of inducing mitochondrial biogenesis at old ages, we will specify targets and treatment strategies that mitigate the antagonistic effects."
"9322094","The National Institute on Drug Abuse initiated its medications development program in 1989. Development of medications for cocaine dependence, now called cocaine user disorder (CUD), were then (Schuster and Snyder, 1989) and still are a top priority of the program. Two strategies have been employed, a top-down and a bottom up strategy. The top-down strategy consists of testing marketed medications for their ability to reduce or eliminate cocaine use. Although positive signals of preliminary efficacy were noted for 8 medications (Vocci and Ling, 2005), none of these medications have advanced to the New Drug Application stage. Moreover, it is unclear whether any medication tested to date, with the possible exception of modafinil for the treatment of CUD without co-occurring alcohol dependence (Kampman e al, 2016), could pass the Food and Drug Administration?s efficacy outcome standards; i.e., abstinence of a significant duration at the 6 month time point of dosing (Winchell et al., 2012). Thus, there is still an unmet need for a medication to treat cocaine use disorder.  Baclofen, a GABA B receptor agonist, has been shown to reduce cocaine self-administration in a number of laboratories under different experimental conditions (Roberts et al., 1996; Shoaib et al., 1998; Campbell et al., 1999). Baclofen also reduced subliminal cocaine cues in cocaine users (Young et al., 2014) but failed to reduce cocaine use in cocaine dependent patients in a clinical trial (Kahn et al., 2009). Baclofen must be taken three time per day and a lack of medication adherence may have contributed to the failure to find efficacy.  GABA B positive allosteric modulators (GABA B PAMs) augment the effect of released GABA. GABA B PAMs reduce cocaine self-administration in rats (Smith et al., 2004) and alcohol self-administration in rats (Maccioni et al., 2012). ADX71441, a GABA B PAM that is the subject of this grant, has been shown to reduce cocaine self- administration in monkeys and to reduce alcohol drinking in mice (Hwa et al., 2014), suggesting it could be a treatment for CUD with co-occurring alcohol use disorder (AUD). CUD with AUD is the more prevalent form of the disorder (Regier et al. 1990; Carroll et al., 2004; Stinson et al., 2005). Thus, ADX 71441 may be more efficacious in a broader clinical population.  Studies proposed in the application will move ADX71441 from preclinical development through Phase I testing, including a Phase Ib interaction study of ADX71441 and cocaine in cocaine experienced volunteers. The current toxicology studies will support the administration of ADX71441 to human volunteers for 2 weeks. Additional toxicology studies are proposed to allow for extended dosing duration in phase II and for women of childbearing potential to participate in Phase II outpatient trials. Thus, the clinical and preclinical studies proposed will allow ADX71441 to move to Phase II studies."
"9456997","PROJECT SUMMARY Cancer immunotherapies have emerged as highly promising approaches to treat cancer patients, particularly since they can be applied across different tissue and cancer types, although clinical efficacy has been limited to a subset of cancer patients. Translational studies with strong focus on biomarkers are critical to understanding the tumor-immune interface. Although numerous technologies for tumor and immune profiling are applied to NCI sponsored immunotherapy trials, standardization of both assay protocols and data analysis methods is crucial to data integration and comparisons across studies for biomarker identification. This underlines the need for data harmonization and creation of uniform analysis pipelines. We propose to establish the Cancer Immunology Data Commons (CIDC) at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute with the goal of advancing translational research efforts using biomarkers to aid in the further development of cancer immunotherapy. The short-term objectives of this application are to establish and manage the data repository for biomarkers and associated clinical data for Cancer Immune Monitoring and Analysis Centers (CIMACs), and provide an informatics environment for integrative multi- dimensional analysis across different studies and storage of data generated. Specifically, we propose to: Aim 1, coordinate with the CIMAC and Laboratory Coordinating Committee (LCC) to harmonize establish assay protocols and data format standards; Aim 2, develop a centralized data repository and management system, and coordinate CIMAC data submission to the CIDC; Aim 3, develop uniform bioinformatics processing pipelines and computing infrastructure for computationally intensive analyses for the CIMACs and the larger research community; Aim 4, provide bioinformatics algorithms to enable integrative and correlative analysis of CIMAC data and integrate other accessible databases and resources for biomarker discovery; Aim 5, develop centralized role-based data access functions with advanced programming interface to enable sharing of CIMAC data; Aim 6, develop interactive web visualization functions to enable investigators and the immunology communities to examine the CIMAC data; and Aim 7, coordinate within the CIMACs-CIDC Network logistic and scientific activities for biomarker discovery and validation. At the conclusion, we will have established a biomarker repository for all data and results generated by CIMACs, supplemented with standardized informatics tools for integration with other accessible databases, and compatible for data contribution and secondary analyses by external researchers. These efforts will provide bioinformatics support for the CIMACs-CIDC Network. The established Data Commons will also provide the foundation for a future immuno-oncology data resource for the larger research community."
"9419213","7. Project Summary/Abstract  The majority of human monkeypox (MPX) infections occur each year in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), notably among rural populations that are highly dependent on bushmeat as a source of protein local resources to sustain villages. In the present project proposal, we propose a range of activities to better understand the epidemiology and ecology of MPX, clinical interventions to prevent human MPX infections, clinical follow-up to better understand the parameters of human MPX virus infections, improvement of laboratory diagnostic surveillance and point-of-care testing, and community and healthcare worker education. The goal of this project is to determine effective epidemiological and clinical interventions that minimize human morbidity and mortality by a) diminishing the risk of infection and b) identifying opportunities to utilize medical countermeasures for treatment.  Maintenance of the existing enhancements to laboratory-based MPX surveillance in Tshuapa Province will continue, as detection and confirmation of disease has direct impacts on the current and proposed studies. We will continue to implement ecological and epidemiological investigations of MPX cases and at-risk communities to better understand specific behaviors or environments that place individuals at higher risk in order to develop more targeted, evidence-based prevention strategies. Accurate geographic data will be collected in Tshuapa to better inform ecological, epidemiological, and health systems public health analyses. We will continue to implement and evaluate educational messaging for communities and healthcare workers to prevent MPX infections and better inform research studies.  The project will continue to implement an existing research protocol to assess the effectiveness of a third-generation smallpox vaccine to prevent MPX infection in a high-risk group with frequent exposures. Data from this study will be reviewed to assess the potential for post-exposure vaccination to protect close contacts of MPX patients. The project will also review the limited evidence on MPX disease presentation and supportive care regimens to develop and implement a protocol to follow MPX patients in order to evaluate disease presentation with respect to clinical care, with the goal of improving patient outcomes.  We will assess approaches to improve the timeliness of MPX diagnosis in DRC by implementation of MPX and Orthopoxvirus testing using existing capacity at regional laboratories in the country. Biosafety and biosecurity practices will be evaluated at select laboratories located in regions with MPX cases and independent validation of test results will be performed at the national laboratory. We will also validate the use of a point-of- care diagnostic test in a setting where patient treatment occurs, evaluating the user operability and acceptance of a lateral flow diagnostic assay to diagnose MPX cases."
"9484824","ABSTRACT?Overall  Racial and ethnic health disparities are ubiquitous, lead to excess morbidity and mortality, and are associated with substantial healthcare costs. These disparities are present even among those with similar access to care, suggesting that providers and health systems (as indicated in the NIMHD framework) are important contributors to health disparities. Yet most studies of interventions to reduce disparities have focused on changing patient behavior and knowledge, leaving substantial gaps in the evidence base of effective interventions to reduce disparities in healthcare delivery.  In this application, we propose The Duke Center for REsearch to AdvanCe Healthcare Equity. REACH Equity will address gaps in current disparities' research by focusing on the quality of healthcare delivery in the clinical encounter?a setting where racial and ethnic disparities in care are well-documented. The overall theme of REACH Equity is to: develop and test interventions that reduce racial and ethnic disparities in health by improving the quality of patient-centered care in the clinical encounter through better provider communication, high quality interpersonal processes of care, and shared decision making. Rather than focusing on a single disease, REACH Equity will support research which is applicable to and can be replicated across diagnoses, settings of care, stages of illness, and throughout the life course.  The Specific Aims of REACH Equity are to: (1) Create an umbrella for the integration of transdisciplinary health disparities research that extends across the campus and health system. (2) Catalyze and support a program of relevant, rigorous, reproducible research related to the Center's theme. (3) Develop the next generation of transdisciplinary health disparities investigators through a research education and training pipeline program which includes undergraduates, medical and graduate students, postdoctoral trainees, and early-career faculty. (4) Diversify the health disparities research workforce by intentionally identifying, mentoring, and developing underrepresented minority (URM) investigators, leaders, and role models. (5) Develop reciprocal partnerships which facilitate community and stakeholder engagement in the Center and ensure widespread dissemination of research findings. REACH Equity will leverage the vast resources of a large health system, nationally ranked training programs, research-intensive academic medical center, and community stakeholder partnerships, to advance scientific knowledge which will have a real-world impact on racial and ethnic disparities in patient-centered care and ultimately health outcomes. The Center will also address national priorities in training health disparities investigators and increasing diversity in the research workforce."
"9271533","Project Summary RNA Helicase A (RHA) is one of the cellular factors recruited into HIV-1 particles during virus assembly. The reduced infectivity of RHA-deficient virions demonstrates that the RHA molecules co-assembled with gRNA exert a continuous impact in early infection. However, it remains unclear how host RHA is specifically recruited during virus assembly, and how it supports the infectivity of progeny virions. Our laboratory has recently reported that the recruitment of RHA is mediated by the direct interactions between RHA and the PBS-segment of the viral genomic RNA during assembly. In addition, our preliminary studies indicate that the specific RHA:PBS-segment interaction may coordinate proper tRNA placement on the PBS-segment to initiate reverse transcription. We propose to employ an innovative integrated NMR/SAXS approach, in combination with cell-based functional assays, to determine the structural basis of the PBS-segment mediated recruitment of RHA during virus assembly, and to investigate the role of RHA during the early stage of viral replication."
"9355053","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):      Many persons with spinal cord injuries and disorders (SCI/D) use a wheelchair for mobility, which keeps them in a seated position for long periods of time. A major complication of wheelchair use is the development of pressure ulcers due to prolonged sitting. Most maneuvers intended to offload sitting surface tissues (e.g. wheelchair pushups, tilts or leans) take the person away from their normal activities and may require longer periods of time than previously thought to provide any benefit. Currently available standing devices allow patients to stand as an alternative means for relieving pressure, but none allow the user to manually wheel about his/her environment when in a fully standing position. The ability to be mobile in the standing position should increase the utility of these systems, increase dosages of standing, and subsequently lead to reductions in secondary complications associated with prolonged sitting. The primary goal of this project is to develop a commercially-viable mobile manual standing wheelchair in close collaboration with a standing wheelchair company. During the first year of the project, a mobile manual standing wheelchair prototype will be developed for a Veteran with a spinal cord injury between the levels of T5 and T8. This wheelchair will be designed to mimic the seating configuration of the Veteran's usual wheelchair (e.g. seat and backrest angles, foot rest height) to allow for comparison of the new mobile manual standing wheelchair with the usual wheelchair. The subject will undergo Wheelchair Skills Testing with (1) their usual wheelchair, (2) the mobile manual standing wheelchair in a seated posture, and (3) the mobile manual standing wheelchair in a standing posture. During the 100 meter test, the subject will also be timed and propulsion cadence will be measured along with perceived exertion on a 10 point Borg scale. Higher speed, lower cadence, and lower perceived exertion will be indicative of improved propulsion efficiency. The subject will also work with therapists in the Minneapolis VA SCI/D Center's apartment to identify possible problems with using the device in the kitchen, bedroom, and bathroom. Information gathered during these tests will be used to improve the design. Retesting of the mobile manual standing wheelchair prototypes will occur after each design iteration. In the second year of the project, two additional mobile manual standing wheelchairs will be developed for two additional Veterans with SCI/D (T1-T4 level and T9-T12 level) and testing will be conducted using the same protocol as for the first subject. In parallel,  the first subject's wheelchair will be tested for durability at the standing wheelchair company using the multi-drum test and the drop test. Design changes will be made to address any failures that occur during durability testing. In year 3 of the project, the second and third subjects' wheelchairs will be sent to the Pittsburgh VA Health Care System for more extensive ANSI/RESNA testing. Any additional design changes that are needed to address failures will be made and testing will be repeated. The end result of the proposed work will be a commercially-viable product that has been developed in close collaboration with a standing wheelchair company. There is a high likelihood that this system will be commercialized after this project, providing Veterans with SCI/D an important new technology that promotes standing and reduces secondary complications of prolonged sitting, such as pressure ulcers."
"9449526","Abstract  The flow of visual information from the retina, through the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN) to the cortex, is regulated by behavior. However, the dynamic circuit interactions that occur in the dLGN of awake animals, and their modulation by behavior, have yet to be revealed. The purpose of this proposal is to develop tools to determine how inhibitory circuits of the dLGN (which utilize the neurotransmitter gamma amino butyric acid, GABA) interact in vivo, and how they collectively shape vision in the context of behavior. The premise of this study is based on two key pieces of information: 1) Our previous ultrastructural analyses and in vitro optogenetic experiments suggest that two extrinsic GABAergic inputs to the dLGN, originating from the thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN) and pretectum (PT), serve to suppress or enhance retinogeniculate transmission respectively. 2) Previous studies suggest that the TRN and PT are active during different behavioral states. Thus, we hypothesize that these two sources of inhibition serve to suppress or enhance visual signals in the dLGN during different behavioral states. We propose to test this hypothesis by recording dLGN visual responses in behaving mice while selectively and independently manipulating TRN and/or PT terminals within the dLGN. In head-fixed alert mice, we will record the visual responses of dLGN neurons to computer-generated visual displays while simultaneously recording running speed, eye movements, and pupil diameter. The Aim 1 experiments will test the hypothesis that the PT functions to enhance retinogeniculate transmission immediately following eye movements, to boost cortical activation following visual target acquisition. For this aim, geniculate responses will be recorded during optogenetic silencing or activation of PT terminals, chemogenetic silencing of TRN terminals, or the combined optogenetic/chemogenetic manipulation of PT and TRN terminals. The Aim 2 experiments will test the hypothesis that the TRN dampens retinogeniculate transmission during quiescent states. For this aim, geniculate responses will be recorded during optogenetic silencing or activation of TRN terminals, chemogenetic silencing of PT terminals, or the combined optogenetic/chemogenetic manipulation of TRN and PT terminals. The development of techniques to manipulate circuits in vivo, in addition to our existing anatomical and in vitro experiment strategies, will provide a powerful multipronged approach to deciphering how the individual components of brain circuits are integrated. Once these in vivo methods are perfected, our methodologically-integrated approach can be used to answer a wide variety of outstanding questions regarding thalamic function."
"9369974","PROJECT SUMMARY  Perhaps one of the most intriguing, yet least studied, aspects of macromolecular transport is traffic through intercellular connections. These connections are termed tunneling nanotubes (TNTs) in mammals and plasmodesmata (Pd) in plants. Whereas both mammalian and plant viruses utilize cell-to-cell transport pathways, the first such capability was identified for plant viruses, the transport of which via Pd represents a conceptual paradigm for intercellular traffic of macromolecules. Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV), whose Pd transport is mediated by its movement protein (MP), is used as tool to study the mechanisms of this transport.  Pd transport comprises 3 sequential pathways (that remain obscure even 35 years after identification of MP as the first Pd-moving protein): targeting to Pd, gating of Pd, and inactivation of the Pd-gating factor to prevent further interference with intercellular communication. This work focuses on these processes, using the following model: (1) In the cytoplasm, MP Pd localization signal (PLS) interacts with SYTA, a synaptotagmin that mediates contacts between the ER and plasma membrane (PM), and MP Pd-gating domain (PDG) interacts with ANK, another plant factor required for viral movement. (2) SYTA directs MP to PM and (3) hands MP to a Pd-associated protein PDLP4, resulting in Pd localization. (4) ANK (or ANK-MP complex) activates Pd-associated ß-1,3 glucanase (PBG), which (5) relaxes the Pd callose sphincter and elevates permeability. (6) MP then is destabilized by the ubiquitin/proteasome system.  Aim 1. Mapping protein interactions in Pd targeting and gating. It is known that MP PLS interacts with SYTA and PDLP4, and MP PGD interacts with ANK, which, in turn, interacts with PBG. But it is not known whether these interactions occur in a single complex with all or some of these proteins, or whether they are mutually exclusive. These interactions will be mapped in vitro, in yeast, and in planta to define the functional pathway for MP targeting to Pd in preparation for their gating. Aim 2. Pd gating mechanism. The hypothesis will be tested that MP redirects ANK from the cytoplasm to Pd, where ANK (or ANK-MP complexes) activates PBG and gates Pd. These experiments will define the functional pathway for MP gaiting of Pd. Aim 3. UPS-mediated down-regulation of MP. Challenge with viruses or bacteria induces expression of the plant defense-related F-box protein VBF. Among its pathogen-encoded substrates, VBF recognizes MP. The hypothesis will be tested that VBF targets MP to proteasomal degradation via the SCFVBF pathway. The expected outcomes of the proposed research will define basic concepts and molecular pathways that underly intercellular transport of macromolecules."
"9426429","The goal of our project, called ?Testing Olfaction in Primary care to detect Alzheimer?s disease and other Dementias (TOPAD)?, is to test the 12-item BSIT, a short, standardized version of the 40-item University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT), for detection of dementia among elderly persons with cognitive concerns in a community-based primary care setting, in response to PAR-15-359 (Novel Approaches to Diagnosing Alzheimer?s Disease and Predicting Progression), and its second aim: ?Identifying new biomarkers that are minimally invasive, inexpensive, usable in community settings?. Many elderly persons develop dementia that remains undiagnosed in primary care settings until it is severe, leading to catastrophic consequences for patients, families, and the health care system. Odor identification impairment with the 40-item UPSIT is a well- validated biomarker of dementia, particularly dementia of the Alzheimer?s type (DAT), The shorter version of the UPSIT, the 12-item BSIT, has been shown to be similar to the UPSIT in distinguishing and predicting MCI and DAT. We propose the BSIT for detection of dementia in primary care because it takes 5 minutes to administer, is inexpensive, and can be administered by non-medical personnel. We propose to test the BSIT for detection of dementia among 600 patients with cognitive concerns, without a diagnosis of dementia, age 65 years and older, who attend primary care practices in Northern Manhattan. The term cognitive concerns includes subjective cognitive decline (SCD), and warning signs identified by relatives, significant others, and health care providers. All participants will be tested with the BSIT, the MMSE, and other common dementia screening tools. The performance of tools will be assessed using as a gold standard cognitive diagnosis based using the 2011 National Institute on Aging (NIA)/Alzheimer Association (AA) recommendations for dementia and MCI using the National Alzheimer?s Coordinating Center (NACC) protocol. Our primary outcome will be dementia diagnosis at the initial evaluation. Cognitive assessments will be repeated every 12 months. Our secondary outcomes will be cognitive transitions to dementia (and subtypes), MCI and MCI subtypes. Our primary aim is to compare the accuracy of the BSIT with the MMSE for dementia detection at initial evaluation among persons aged 65 years and older with cognitive concerns in primary care. In secondary analyses, we will examine the secondary outcomes and compare the accuracy of the BSIT for dementia detection with other instruments: Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MOCA), Mini-Cog and Memory Impairment Screen (MIS). Our secondary aim is to compare the BSIT with the MMSE in predicting cognitive transitions at 12 and 24 months. In secondary analyses, we will compare the BSIT with other screening instruments (MOCA, Mini-Cog, MIS). TOPAD will be conducted by a multidisciplinary team of experts in Alzheimer?s research, odor identification testing, dementia diagnosis, and primary care."
"9071205","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The central theme of this proposal is structural and mechanistic studies of nucleic acids, proteins, and their interactions. The two broad topics that will serve as foci for our research are: 1) the structure and mechanism of topoisomerases, and 2) the structure, architecture, and mechanism of RNase P. The aim of our work is to discover and explore paradigms that help to illuminate the structure and mechanism of biological molecules common to all three domains of life (bacteria, archaea, and eukaryota).  Topoisomerases are ubiquitous proteins found across all three domains of life. They are involved in several cellular processes and the importance of their cellular role is underscored by the fact that they are the target of several cancer chemotherapeutic agents and antibiotics. The study of the structure, mechanism, and function of topoisomerases not only furthers our understanding at many different levels of proteins that interact with DNA and alter its topological  properties, but also provides important information to aid in the design of new therapeutic agents. To accomplish our goals, our comprehensive studies of topoisomerases will focus on two large and complementary projects: Project 1. Structural and biochemical studies of type IA, type IC and type II topoisomerases, and Project 2. Single molecule studies of type IA and type II topoisomerases. These two major projects will help answer crucial questions that are needed to advance the field to the next level.  RNase P is a ribonucleoprotein complex found in almost all organisms, from bacteria to humans, and responsible for processing many different RNA molecules in the cell. It is composed of one essential RNA subunit and one or more proteins, but in all cases the RNA component is responsible for catalysis. RNase P was one of the first catalytic RNA molecules discovered and its study has been pivotal to our understanding of the role of RNA molecules in catalysis. Our studies of the structure and function of RNase P are providing important and relevant information on a key ribozyme involved in RNA processing in the cell, while also furthering our understanding of the structure and function of large RNA molecules and ribonucleoprotein complexes. To ensure that RNase P continues to be a paradigm for understanding RNA structure and function, large ribonucleoprotein complexes, and also the evolution from the ancient RNA world, a third project, Project 3. Structural and biophysical studies of RNase P, will be centered on structural and functional studies on RNase P expanding it to include RNase Ps from all three domains of life."
"9312667","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): To respond to the HIV epidemic and reduce health disparities in HIV incidence and outcomes, we propose a Prevention Research Center (PRC) at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) that facilitates significant and innovative health science research through partnerships with public health colleagues that ultimately improves public health. The HIV epidemic continues to be a major public health crisis in the U.S., with more than 1 million people living with HIV and more than 50,000 becoming newly infected every year1. Given the progress in preventing and treating HIV, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has identified HIV as a winnable battle, Healthy People 2020 has included HIV as a topic area, sexual health is part of the National Prevention Strategy, and the White House has made HIV a policy priority with the release of the National HIV/AIDS Strategy. HIV has had a disproportionate impact on African Americans, representing one of the largest health disparities in the U.S. While comprising just 13% of the total national population, African Americans account for 51% of all new HIV/AIDS diagnoses. While HIV disproportionately impacts African Americans, Black gay and other men who have sex with men (BMSM) are particularly impacted. In particular young BMSM (aged 13 - 24 years) are the only subpopulation where the rate of new infections continues to increase. These national data highlight the urgent need to focus research on eliminating HIV health disparities among African Americans in general and BMSM in particular. This application proposes to develop and implement authentic community engagement and support implementation of a research project that focuses on linking, engaging and reengaging in care young BMSM living with HIV. Our overall aims are to:  1. Establish a Prevention Research Center that focuses on appropriate adaptation, dissemination and  implementation of HIV health disparities research for application to policy, programs and practices;  2. Enhance collaborations with partners in the community, health care systems, government agencies,  institutions and universities to facilitate innovative, high-impact, multidisciplinary HIV research and  knowledge translation to training, programs, practices and policies;  3. Increase the capacity of partners in the community, health care systems, government agencies,  institutions and universities to understand and implement the findings from HIV research through  targeted training, communication and dissemination; and  4. Develop an implementation research portfolio that translates and adapts an evidence-based  intervention into practice settings. We propose to begin this portfolio by studying the implementation of an evaluated intervention to improve linkage of HIV-infected young Black MSM to clinical care."
"9383327","Project Summary The long-term objective is to understand how visual performance varies across the visual field during childhood, adolescence and adulthood, and the neural correlates and possible oculomotor correlates underlying such changes. Vision at the center of gaze (fovea) has high sensitivity and resolution, facilitating good performance in many tasks, but performance decreases with increasing distance from fovea. Simple radial distance from fovea ?eccentricity? is not the only relevant retinotopic parameter for perception. At any given eccentricity stimuli can fall anywhere along circle, and the polar angle of a stimulus at ?isoeccentric? locations also has pronounced effects on perception in human adults, captured by a Performance Fields (PF) map. And yet the role of the polar angle has not been studied in children and adolescents, and the underlying neural representations and possible oculomotor correlates are practically unknown. PF present an opportunity for establishing tight quantitative links between behavior and neural representations of visual space. The proposed studies will measure PF in children, adolescents and adults, under different attentional states (Aim 1), along with fMRI visual field maps (Aim 2) and fixational oculomotor behavior (Aim 3). By highlighting and characterizing the functional, oculomotor and neural correlates of PF and their modulations across multiple timescales, the proposed studies will elucidate critical constraints on perception and performance as a function of polar angle. We will implement a computational observer model that is the glue that binds the three aims together. In addition to advancing our knowledge of visual perception, the proposed research will enable us to make predictions about human performance. The characterization of PF has significant implications for ergonomic and human factors applications, which should take into account functional plasticity during development, compensation via selective attention, and oculomotor behavior. For example, it is of critical importance for user-interfaces that present information at different locations of the visual field. With an understanding of how attention affects PF we can extend our knowledge to real-world displays, such as navigation and cockpit alerting systems, control panel layouts in cars, computer-aided detection systems, and software for presenting radiological images. Furthermore, the gained knowledge can aid the design of artificial image recognition systems. This research will inform the development of compensatory strategies and interventions to deal more effectively with the limitations of the visual system. In addition, understanding the functional causes of performance differences across the visual field and how attention and/or oculomotor behavior interact with them will improve our models of visual dysfunction (e.g., macular degeneration, retinitis pigmentosa), as well as the diagnosis of these disorders."
"9468525","Project Summary Periodontitis, which can result in tooth loss, is a serious gum disease and public health concern. Periodontitis progression is usually measured using multiple clinical outcomes on each tooth per patient over time. Thus, statistical models used to analyze periodontitis progression need to account for the multiple correlation structures: the correlation between teeth within each patient and the correlation between temporal observations on the same patient. Further, when a patient?s periodontitis progression is monitored over time, the number of observations tends to decrease due to the patient?s losing teeth, resulting in another analytical challenge. Current statistical methods to analyze dental studies, including periodontitis progression, need further development to accommodate a more complex data structure. To advance periodontitis research, and motivated by the limited availability of statistical methods to model the effect of time-dependent covariates on multiple outcomes including ordinal variables while properly accounting the multiple correlation structures, we propose the following three specific aims as the research component of the fellowship training: (1) Extend existing methods to model longitudinal ordinal outcomes; (2) Extend existing methods to jointly model multiple outcomes; and (3) Extend existing methods to analyze time-dependent covariates. For each aim, we will (a) develop models based on existing methods, (b) perform simulation studies to evaluate the model performance, and (c) apply each of our proposed methods to analyze a data set from a real longitudinal dental study. We will make the proposed methods easily accessible to statisticians and dental health professionals by publishing our results in biostatistical and dental health journals, presenting our results at statistical and dental conferences, and uploading the programming code onto a public website. The proposed research will help advance the field of dental research by allowing researchers to use complex dental data efficiently and to properly account for multiple correlation structures."
"9452327","Alessandro Biffi is a Behavioral Neurologist and Neuropsychiatrist at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH), whose career goal is to become a leading clinician-investigator in the field of the neuropsychiatric manifestations of cerebrovascular disorders. In preliminary studies, Dr. Biffi has found that apathy and depression develop with high frequency in survivors of Intracerebral Hemorrhage (ICH). Furthermore, development of these neuropsychiatric disorders substantially increases risk for a combined subsequent endpoint including death, stroke and dementia. Prevention of apathy/depression after ICH may therefore represent a novel strategy to improve long-term outcome after ICH. The proposed project addresses key unresolved questions that must be answered in order to designs trials of apathy/depression prevention after ICH. These questions are: 1) what is the relationship between post-ICH apathy/depression (PIA/D) and each key individual outcome for the patient (death, recurrent ICH, ischemic stroke, dementia)?; 2) which biological processes responsible for PIA/D could be targeted with novel prevention strategies? Dr. Biffi has specifically singled out anatomical ICH characteristics, underlying neurodegenerative/cerebrovascular chronic conditions and long-term blood pressure control as biological mechanisms for investigation. Addressing these questions is made all the more pressing by the lack of prior studies of post-ICH apathy/depression. Published studies of stroke-related neuropsychiatric sequelae focused almost exclusively on ischemic stroke, and are therefore unable to address ICH-specific biological mechanisms (e.g. the role of hydrocephalus and intraventricular hemorrhage in predicting apathy/depression risk). Dr. Biffi established an early-career track record investigating the epidemiology of cerebrovascular conditions, and acquiring expertise in genomics and bioinformatics in the process. He also generated preliminary data supporting the feasibility of the proposed research, as part of a mentored R25 award. The proposed K23 award will train Dr. Biffi in selection, capture and interpretation of cognitive and neuropsychiatric measures, health data remote monitoring, and advanced neuroimaging techniques. To this end, Dr. Biffi has assembled a team of experts in all aforementioned areas, leveraging the extensive resources and exceptional environment of Massachusetts General Hospital / Harvard Medical School. Dr. Jonathan Rosand will serve as primary mentor, and coordinate a team of highly experienced co-mentors including Drs. David Bennett, Anand Viswanathan, Deborah Blacker, David Salat, Kamal Jethwani and Janet Sherman. This award will provide Dr. Biffi with the skills to evolve into an independent clinician-investigator, focused on prevention of neuropsychiatric disorders in cerebrovascular diseases - with specific emphasis on apathy/depression prevention to improve long-term outcome after intracerebral hemorrhage."
"9418281","In this U01 grant we propose a 5 year engineering development effort to advance Magnetic Particle Imaging (MPI) to replace MRI as the next-generation functional brain imaging tool for human neuroscience. MPI is a young but extremely promising technology that uses the non-linear magnetic response of ironoxide nanoparticles to localize their presence in the body. MPI directly detects the nanoparticle's magnetization rather than using secondary effects on the Magnetic Resonance relaxation times. Thus, while MPI and MRI share many technologies, the MPI method does not use the MR phenomena in any way. Our plan is to detect the activation-induced and resting-state changes in the iron-oxide concentration in the cerebral capillary network by monitoring the local iron oxide concentration (and thus local Cerebral Blood Volume, CBV). This CBV-contrast source is well- proven in animal and human fMRI studies which detect CBV changes by MRI using the same iron- oxide agents, but indirectly. But, by developing MPI as the detection modality, we show that there is a potential 10-fold increase in the contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) of human neuronal activation.  In the planning grant stage, we analyzed multiple potential MPI scanner designs for humans and settled on a Field-Free-Line geometry. We developed the simulation tools to model the performance of a human sized instrument. Additionally, we validated our modeling by building and testing a small, rodent-scale MPI detector in our lab at MGH. Using this device, we showed the first ever demonstration of functional imaging with MPI using a rodent hypercapnia model. In this U01 phase we seek the resources to construct and validate the human scale, rotating FFL-style MPI device analyzed in the planning grant. After construction, we will validate its performance in phantom studies, and also in an awake-behaving macaque model that we have previously used for fMRI studies. Finally, we will validate the performance of the device in limited human fMPI studies.  By developing a new and more sensitive detection methodology for functional human imaging, we hope to add a powerful new non-invasive methods to the tools available to neuroscientists studying the human brain in health and disease."
"9393626","Project Summary.  Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) is a debilitating chronic condition that affects millions worldwide. Current protocols to monitor disease severity and track response to drugs requires patients to visit clinics, where blood or urine samples are drawn and sent to a central clinical laboratory for processing. This proposal aims to develop point of care user-friendly diagnostics that can be used by patients at home. The strategy is to develop electrochemical assays to monitor inflammatory biomarker levels in urine using repurposed glucose meters. Specifically, Matrixmetalloproteases (MMP) 2 and 9 that are up-regulated and excreted in urine during an acute inflammatory response or flare-ups in IBD patients will be correlated to established laboratory inflammatory biomarkers such as Heamtoxylin and Eosin (H&E) stains and lipocalin-2 (LCN-2) levels. In specific aim 1, assays to detect MMP 2 and 9 using glucose meters will be developed. Substrates that release an electrochemically active molecule upon the action of MMP 2 or 9 will be generated and a glucose meter will be repurposed to detect the electrochemically active molecule. Selectivity, sensitivity, stability of reagents and other features will be established for this novel assay. In specific aim 2, the assay will be used to monitor disease progression and response to drugs using an IL10 -/- mouse model, which resembles the physiological, histological and biochemical features of human IBD. Specifically, the degree of inflammation will be assessed using the new noninvasive method and the results compared to invasive methods of H&E stains and LCN-2 levels. Additionally, response to anti TNF-? therapy will be tracked using the different methods. To accomplish these goals, a solid team of scientists with expertise in complementary areas that include chemistry, assay development, molecular biology and clinical diagnostics have been assembled. Successfully executing the specific aims will set the stage for more elaborate studies using patient samples. Self monitoring at home is expected to provide individualized response to therapy and lead to a personalized medicine approach for IBD patients. Results from this strategy can also impact other fields; similar approaches to monitor disease severity and response to treatment for other chronic ailments can be developed."
"9331644","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The cornea, our window to the world, is subject to damage caused by injury, infection and other diseases. Approaches are being developed to treat these corneas by transplantation of cornea epithelial stem cells. A major medical challenge lies in being able to isolate sufficient quantities of these cells for culture, expansion, and transplantation. We still lack a basic understanding of their proliferation, migratory behaviors and precise markers to identify these cells. We also do not know what factors regulate these behaviors, which is essential for enhancing the therapeutic potential of cornea epithelial stem cells. Recent evidence suggests that cutaneous nerves may be a key component of the epithelial stem cell niche. The frog Xenopus is an established vertebrate model with distinct advantages for studies of cell and molecular biology. The development and morphology of the mature frog cornea is essentially identical to that of humans. We developed tools that make Xenopus an excellent system to study the biology of these cells. Our central hypotheses are that limbal stem cells and their proliferative progeny exhibit specific cleavage patterns and express specific combinations of genes that will allow one to distinguish these cells. Further, these cells respond to cues released by damage to undergo increased proliferation, being able to migrate to wound sites, and finally that nerves serving the cornea represent a critical component of the epithelial stem cell niche that regulates the behavior of these cells. This proposal has three specific aims to address these hypotheses: I) determine the normal proliferative patterns and gene expression profiles to distinguish these stem cells and their progeny, and examine the role of pluripotency genes in regulating the behavior of these cells. II) Determine how these cells respond to damage and whether they undergo active migration during homeostasis and repair. III). Determine if cutaneous nerves of the cornea play a key role in supporting these proliferative cells. To address these aims we developed new tools that permit direct, continuous visualization of these cells in live animals over prolonged periods of time. We have also developed Xenopus models to study cornea wound repair and limbal stem cell deficiency (LSCD). Finally, we can ligate the corneal nerves with tremendous precision to test their role in supporting these cells. This research is innovative in its use of high-throughpu transgenic approaches in Xenopus to permit real-time observations of live cornea epithelial stem cells in which we can characterize specific patterns of gene expression (markers) that identify these cells. This study will also determine if corneal nerves represent a critical component of the stem cell niche that supports these cells. Tens of thousands of patients develop neurotrophic keratitis, forms of corneal dystrophy, LSCD, and other eye conditions annually in the U.S. that require corneal transplants (about 40,000/year). The proposed research is significant, as it will develop tools and approaches that can be used to treat these diseases and injuries of the cornea."
"9468612","Project Summary: Accumulating evidence suggests that mRNA translation is altered in various neurological disorders. However, it remains largely unknown whether and how mRNA dysregulation contributes to disease onset. Microcephaly is a condition that arises in neurodevelopment characterized by smaller head size in infants that affects 6 in 10,000 children in the United States. Using a model of intracerebral inoculation of mouse embryonic brain, it has been established that intracerebral infection of the Zika virus during brain development can cause Microcephaly. The purpose of this proposal is to investigate if Zika virus (ZIKV) infection induces microcephaly through dysregulation of mRNA translation. ZIKV infection results in reduced cell proliferation, cell cycle arrest, and an increased apoptosis of Neural Progenitor Cells (NPCs), the cells considered to be most vulnerable in microcephaly. Recent work has reported that cells infected with the Zika Virus or other flavivirus family member Dengue Virus exhibit a decrease in mRNA translation of the host cell mRNA. Previously published work has also shown that knockout of the RNA-binding protein Lin28a leads to reduced NPC self-renewal and microcephaly in mice. Using mouse genetic tools, this study described that Lin28 can promote NPC proliferative cell behaviors, and that it may do so through modulating mRNA translation. Preliminary evidence has further suggested that reduced mRNA translation in NPCs is sufficient to cause microcephaly. These studies have collectively suggested that mRNA translation may be vulnerable in NPCs in Microcephaly, and identified that Lin28a gain- and loss-of-function mouse models are valuable genetic tools to manipulate mRNA translation specifically in NPCs. These major observations have led to the following hypothesis: The Zika virus causes Microcephaly through dysregulating global and gene specific host mRNA translation in neural progenitor cells. To address the hypothesis stated above, the following Aims will be performed: 1) Test to what extent mRNA translation dysfunction contributes to Zika virus-induced Microcephaly. To determine if increasing mRNA translation in NPCs can rescue ZIKV-induced microcephaly, the Lin28a overexpression mouse model will be combined with embryonic inoculation of ZIKV. This will help determine the impact or contribution that decreased host cell mRNA translation has in causing ZIKV-induced Microcephaly. 2) Identify what genes are differentially regulated in NPCs at the mRNA translation level in ZIKV-induced Microcephaly. To study mRNA translation specifically in NPCs in vivo, a novel mouse model will be used in which HA-tagged ribosomal protein Rpl22 will be expressed in a Cre-dependent manner and the resulting pull- down sample will be taken for RNA-seq. This will illuminate trends in mRNA dysregulation and provide the field with potential therapeutic targets in the context of ZIKV-induced microcephaly.!"
"9548130","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         The goal of the present study is to evaluate the efficacy and durability of benefits of repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) as a promising non-invasive therapeutic treatment for executive function deficits reported in Veterans with mild to moderate Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) patients. Although much progress has been made towards understanding the various deficits following TBI, progress has yet to be made towards identifying and assessing therapeutic treatment options that are responsive to TBI symptoms. Many returning OEF/OIF Veterans with concussion histories report cognitive symptoms that may last for months or years, and affect every day function. Symptoms faced by Veterans with mild to moderate TBI include executive function deficits such as impaired attention (including shifting sets), verbal fluency, poor planning, reduced working memory, and mental flexibility. The primary objective is to assess the efficacy of rTMS in Veterans with mild to moderate TBI in improving executive functioning. A recent VA study reported improvements in PTSD and related symptoms in Veterans with PTSD who received rTMS (Watts et al., 2012). Repetitive TMS is a method of delivering therapeutic, non-invasive brain stimulation that is currently being used at the VA Palo Alto and Stanford University in a number of clinical trials. For this pilot study we propose to enroll 40 Veterans diagnosed with mild to moderate TBI (age range 20-65). Inclusion Criteria: mild and moderate TBI will be defined as: post-traumatic amnesia (PTA < 1 day for mild; 1 day> x < 7days for moderate). Because of the extensively documented co-occurrence of TBI with PTSD, (Veterans with TBI with and without PTSD will be enrolled). PTSD will be assessed using standard clinical measures. Exclusionary criteria: patients will be screened for TMS and MRI safety. The duration of the study will be two years, with a 1.5 year enrollment period, and a final half-year of follow-up completion. Following a preliminary telephone screen, Veterans will be scheduled for onsite informed consent, screening, and baseline assessments. Using an electronic randomization form, participants will be enrolled into two groups: active rTMS or sham rTMS. As this is a double blind placebo controlled study, only the subject ID number is provided to the nurse administrating the rTMS treatment. After randomization, the rTMS nurse will test the motor threshold (MT) for rTMS. Each participant will be in the trial for a total of approximately (28) weeks: 1-2 weeks screening, (2) weeks acute treatment phase (including MRI pre and post rTMS) and 24 weeks (6 month) follow-up phase (with MRI, neuropsychological testing and self-report measures). Left Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex (DLPFC) will be the stimulation site as it is shown to be affective in treatment of depression and approved by FDA. All participants will receive a minimum of 20 treatments before being evaluated for change in executive function (primary outcome measure). The primary hypothesis is that Veterans receiving active rTMS will show improvement more than sham treated Veterans in (performance between baseline and last assessment of >1 SD on either the Trail Making Test part B, D-KEFS Verbal Fluency and/or D-KEFS Color-Word Interference Test). Additional analysis will include: Sustained Improvement on executive function composite score; secondary consequences of TBI scores on Quality of Life (QOL) scale, moderators of response such as age, severity of symptoms at baseline, type of comorbidity (e.g., PTSD); and, functional brain activity changes with rTMS treatment. This pilot study will be one of the first to demonstrate rTMS as a treatment for executive function deficit in Veterans with mild to moderate TBI. Additionally, it would also report on the efficacy of using fMRI as a biomarker to capture this improvement in executive function."
"9424406","The goal of this proposal is to gain a biophysical understanding of human orexin receptor agonist binding and activation, and to use this knowledge to develop small-molecule orexin receptor agonists as neuropharmacological tools and potential therapeutics for narcolepsy/cataplexy and other diseases. Narcolepsy is a life-long debilitating disorder affecting approximately 200,000 Americans, which is characterized by an inability to maintain wakefulness, sleep attacks, sudden loss of muscle function, and sleep paralysis. Current treatments for narcolepsy (such as psychostimulant drugs) do not treat the underlying neurochemical deficits and exhibit undesirable side-effects. Animal models and clinical investigations of human patients show that narcolepsy is caused by deficiency of the orexin (hypocretin) neuropeptides produced by neurons of the lateral hypothalamus, and that exogenous replacement of orexin activity may cure the disease. However, orexins cannot be used as therapeutic agents because they are peptides, which do not penetrate the blood-brain barrier and show poor activity after oral administration due to metabolic decomposition.  We propose to use new technical advances in GPCR structural biology to determine X-ray structures of the orexin receptors in orexin-bound and small-molecule agonist-bound states, revealing the detailed non- covalent interactions that stabilize these complexes as well as changes in conformation of the receptors that are a consequence of agonist binding. In the second Aim, we will develop conformation-specific nanobodies that bind and stabilize the orexin receptor active state, and solve nanobody co-crystal structures to understand the propagated structural changes across the membrane that link the extracellular neuropeptide binding site and the intracellular G protein coupling site. In the third Aim, we will integrate structural insights with computational docking/simulation and medicinal chemistry to improve the affinity and potency of small- molecule orexin receptor agonists that were previously identified in a high-throughput screen. Our combination of strengths in GPCR structural biology, synthetic and medicinal chemistry, and computational chemistry places us in a unique position to design small-molecule orexin mimics with drug-like properties that can be further developed into therapeutics for the treatment of narcolepsy and other neurological disorders."
"9365702","SUMMARY The overall aim of this project is to use the recently developed cryo-electron microscopy technique of microcrystal electron diffraction (MicroED) for the structure determination of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR). GPCRs are an extremely important class of membrane proteins and are responsible for controlling a wide variety of physiological responses. Because of their key physiological roles, a large percentage of currently approved drugs target these receptors, and they represent attractive targets for drug development. Despite the importance of GPCRs, detailed understanding of their high resolution structure and function is limited in large part because of the difficulty associated growing large crystals necessary for X-ray crystallography. In this project, MicroED will be used to study GPCR structure, as the method is capable of determining structures from microcrystals several orders of magnitude smaller than those used by conventional X-ray crystallography. The project will employ and optimize new MicroED sample preparation methodology to allow data collection from GPCR microcrystals grown in the viscous lipidic cubic phase (LCP). Electron diffraction data will be collected and processed using previously developed MicroED methods. The new methods for GPCRs will be validated in Aim 1 using the previously solved beta-2 adrenergic receptor (?2AR) and A2A Adenosine receptor (A2AAR) as models. New structural details will be studied in Aims 2 and 3 by using MicroED to improve the resolution and modeling of the rhodopsin-arrestin complex (Aim 2), and finally to determine a novel structure of the serotonin receptor 5HT4 (Aim 3). The long term goal of this project is to develop and use MicroED as a high-throughput structure determination method for GPCRs and other important membrane proteins grown in LCP. By determining the structures outlined in these aims, not only will new light will be shed on GPCR structure and function, but the optimized protocols will open the door to MicroED analysis for a variety of membrane protein samples. This will make MicroED a valuable tool for membrane protein structure determination of targets that have resisted other structural methods because of difficulties with optimizing crystal size for X-ray crystallography."
"9464886","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Antigen-experienced memory T cells constitute a diverse, heterogeneous population of immune cells that is generated throughout life in response to a variety of pathogens, vaccines, allergens, self-antigens and other environment factors. In fact, as we age, generation of new naïve T cells diminishes and memory T cell populations dominate the repertoire. Thus, the basic mechanisms that regulate the functions of diverse memory T cell populations has broad relevance for a variety of diseases and pathological conditions including vaccine designs, immunotherapy protocols and treatment or prevention of inflammatory or autoimmune disorders. Although the formation and differentiation of memory CD8+ and CD4+ T cells in the circulation has been extensively characterized, the capacity for memory T cells to actively home to and infiltrate tissues where they exhibit their effector functions is less understood. We have recently discovered that memory CD8+ T cells require post-translational O-linked glycosylation of selectin ligands for trafficking to and infiltrating non- lymphoid tissues. Furthermore, we identified that de novo synthesis of core 2 O-glycans is restricted to memory T cells and can be regulated in an antigen-independent manner. However, the basic molecular mechanisms regulating core 2 O-glycan synthesis and trafficking of memory CD8+ and CD4+ T cells during infections are yet to be fully characterized. Specifically, we will 1) determine if different CD8+ T cell populations have the capacity to synthesize core 2 O-glycans and traffic into non-lymphoid tissues, 2) define the molecular and transcriptional mechanisms that regulate core 2 O-glycan synthesis in memory CD8+ T cells, and 3) determine if memory CD4+ T cells require core 2 O-glycan synthesis to traffic into non-lymphoid tissues during either acute or chronic viral infections. Thus, the overall goal of our study will be to identify and characterize the mechanisms regulating the trafficking of diverse memory T cell populations and how this can be enhanced (for host protection) or inhibited (for allergies or autoimmunity)."

"9363736","PROJECT SUMMARY (ABSTRACT) Education is a recognized social factor with important implications for health. Educational attainment is associated with mortality and morbidity for a variety of conditions and behaviors. We know less about the mechanisms that connect education to health. In January 2016, NIH released, ?Education and Health: New Frontiers? (PAR 16-080) to delve further into this topic. We propose a mixed methods approach to address our overall aim ? to investigate if and how different education trajectories affect health and how this association may differ by sex, race/ethnicity, and family and school circumstances. Educational trajectories refer to how  people attain their education status, such as high school or college graduate, over time. We will first analyze the 1979 and 1997 waves of data of the National Longitudinal Study of Youth (NLSY). Then, based upon these findings, we will conduct semi-structured interviews in three diverse populations across the US to explore possible mechanisms for the associations observed quantitatively. Finally, we will go to an additional secondary dataset, Reasons for Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke (REGARDS) that will allow us to explore the possible roles of some of the mechanisms identified qualitatively. The Specific Aims for our mixed methods study are: 1) Using both theory-driven and sequence analysis (data-driven) techniques, determine what the most common education trajectories are for the NLSY 1979 and 1997 cohorts. Examples include: a) straight through or ?uninterrupted?; b) dropped out of high school; and c) ?interrupted high school,? where students left but returned subsequently to get a high school diploma or a GED. Comparable examples are possible for a college degree, with the additional example of graduated from high school, went to work or unemployed, then went to college; 2)Investigate how educational trajectories are associated with body mass index and obesity, chronic conditions, depression, and mortality. 2a) How do the relationships differ by sex, race/ethnicity, and family characteristics (e.g. maternal education attainment, adverse childhood experiences (in the 1979 cohort)); 2b) How do the relationships differ by school characteristics (e.g. dropout rate, economic composition), school policies, and schooling social milieu (e.g. education level of people in the same community) ? School characteristics include racial/ethnic composition of the school, dropout rate of the school, and/or economic composition of students attending the school. Social milieu includes education level of people in the same community; 3) Based on the results of Aim #2, use intensive semi-structured one-one-one interviews of qualitative methods of people with different demographic characteristics (i.e. men and women; White, African American etc) and educational trajectories in different geographic areas to investigate potential mechanisms linking education trajectories to health, e.g. family dynamics, residential mobility, access to financial and social capital, 4) Based on results from Aim #3, investigate the identified mechanisms with the NLSY79, NLSY97, and Reasons for Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke (REGARDS) studies."
"9564504","ABSTRACT The aims of this study are to define the structural features of allosteric sites on muscarinic acetylcholine receptors, as well as the regions of the receptor that regulate the cooperativity between allosteric and orthosteric sites. Muscarinic receptors have become a key model system for the molecular study of allosteric drug action at G protein-coupled receptors. Therefore, the knowledge to be gained from the proposed experiments is expected to have benefits ranging far beyond the advancement of muscarinic pharmacology. Allosteric drugs have inherent advantages of selectivity, efficacy, and safety. These advantages are especially important when the desired effect is to enhance the action of a neurotransmitter at a particular receptor in the brain. Allosteric enhancers are able to preserve the pattern of activity that is dictated by the very complex spatiotemporal motif of synaptic activity; by contrast, directly-acting agonists tend to disrupt these complex motifs that are the hallmark of synaptic activity in the brain. Furthermore, it is now becoming clear that there are multiple allosteric sites on muscarinic receptors. The usual case is that an allosteric ligand binds to its specific site and regulates the affinity with which acetylcholine binds to its (orthosteric) site on the receptor. This results in either a gain or loss in the potency of acetylcholine. We have recently identified a novel allosteric site, through which specific ligands have the unusual effect of being able to regulate the ability of acetylcholine to activate the receptor once it is bound, while altering potency only slightly or not at all. We have found that the sites for these different types of ligands are distinct and can be activated simultaneously. Furthermore, specific combinations of ligands depress low levels of response to neurotransmitter and enhance maximal response, or vice versa; we call this effect signal shaping. Additionally, we have designed tools and techniques that are sensitive to the molecular nature of the receptor and are calibrating them against verified monomeric and oligomeric receptors. We will use these tools to test our model that the functional receptor unit in tissues is an oligomer. Finally, we will label the best known muscarinic allosteric site with an irreversible ligand and determine which residue is covalently labeled through the use of affinity chromatography, HPLC, and mass spectrometric methods. We expect these studies to lead to improvements in the cholinergic pharmacology of disorders of the central nervous system, including Alzheimer's disease, and to contribute to an understanding of the potential for allosteric modulation of other G protein-coupled receptors."
"9447919","Abstract Natural killer (NK) cells kill tumors and infected cells by integrating signals from two functional types of receptors, activation and inhibitory. In the mouse, many of these receptors belong to the Ly49 family, encoded by a cluster of highly related genes, discovered by the applicant?s laboratory. The highly polymorphic Ly49 receptors and killer immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIRs) on human NK cells are examples of convergent evolution. In murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) infection, the applicant?s laboratory previously showed that the Ly49H activation receptor is responsible for genetic resistance of C57BL/6 mice to MCMV infections. Ly49H recognizes a molecule encoded by MCMV, in a manner independent of major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I) alleles. However, studies from other groups suggest that in non-C57BL/6 mice, other Ly49 activation receptor alleles recognize MCMV-modified MHC-I. Moreover, still other data suggest that Ly49 inhibitory receptors can also provide protection against MCMV, depending on MHC-I alleles. It has been challenging to study these issues further due to the complexities of the Ly49 receptors, including their polymorphism and variegated expression. Nonetheless, these issues are important to understanding the role of human inhibitory KIRs and their MHC-I ligands that are also paradoxically associated with protection from viral infection. Here the applicant presents preliminary data that MCMV is controlled by NK cells in a manner independent of Ly49H but restricted to a specific MHC-I allele. Preliminary data from the applicant?s laboratory strongly support a role for a Ly49 inhibitory receptor. Thus, the Specific Aims of this proposal are to: 1) Identify Ly49 responsible for MHC-restricted resistance to MCMV; 2) Determine role of Ly49 responsible for MHC-restricted resistance; and 3) Determine how MCMV is involved in Ly49-dependent resistance. Thus, these studies will provide new insight into the function of NK cell inhibitory receptors in infection."
"9380854","PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Neuroscience is highly specialized?even visual submodalities such as motion, depth, form and color processing are often studied in isolation. One disadvantage of this isolation is that results from each subfield are not brought together to constrain common underlying neural circuitry. Yet, to understand the cortical computations that support vision, it is important to unify our fragmentary models that capture isolated insights across visual submodalities so that all relevant experimental and theoretical efforts can benefit from the most powerful and robust models that can be achieved. This proposal aims to take the first concrete step in that direction by unifying models of direction selectivity, binocular disparity selectivity and 3D motion selectivity (also known as motion-in-depth) to reveal circuits and understand computations from V1 to area MT. Motion in 3D inherently bridges visual submodalities, necessitating the integration of motion and binocular processing, and we are motivated by two recent paradigm-breaking physiological studies that have shown that area MT has a robust representation of 3D motion. In Aim 1, we will create the first unified model and understanding of the relationship between pattern and 3D motion in MT. In Aim 2, we will construct the first unified model of motion and disparity processing in MT. In Aim 3, we will develop a large-scale biologically plausible model of these selectivities that represents realistic response distributions across an MT population. Having a population output that is complete enough to represent widely-used visual stimuli will amplify our ability to link to population read-out theories and to link to results from psychophysical studies of visual perception. Key elements of our approach are (1) an iterative loop between modeling and electrophysiological experiments; (2) building a set of shared models, stimuli, data and analysis tools in a cloud-based system that unifies efforts across labs, creating opportunities for deep collaboration between labs that specialize in relevant submodalities, and encouraging all interested scientists to contribute and benefit; (3) using model-driven experiments to answer open, inter-related questions that involve motion and binocular processing, including motion opponency, spatial integration, binocular integration and the timely problem of how 3D motion is represented in area MT; (4) unifying insights from filter-based models and conceptual, i.e., non-image- computable, models to generate the first large-scale spiking hierarchical circuits that predict and explain how correlated signals and noise are transformed across multiple cortical stages to carry out essential visual computations; and (5) carrying out novel simultaneous recordings across visual areas. This research also has potential long-term benefits in medicine and technology. It will build fundamental knowledge about functional cortical circuitry that someday may be useful for interpreting dysfunctions of the cortex or for helping biomedical engineers construct devices to interface to the brain. Insights gained from the visual cortex may also help to advance computer vision technology."
"9318139","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Deaf sign language users and people with hearing loss comprise health disparity populations overlooked by most public health research, surveillance and programs. The mission of the Rochester Prevention Research Center (RPRC) is to promote health and prevent disease with these two distinct populations through community-based participatory research (CBPR). A RPRC long term objective is to eliminate health disparities in Deaf and Hard-of-Hearing (D/HOH) populations. RPRC will work to achieve the mission and that goal through six aims based on the key elements of a Prevention Research Center (PRC): Aim 1 - To organize and administer RPRC to carry out CBPR with D/HOH communities; Aim 2 - To engage D/HOH individuals and stakeholder organizations in all aspects of RPRC activities; Aim 3 - To connect RPRC and stakeholders through effective bi-directional communication channels; Aim 4 - To create education and training programs that enhance D/HOH communities' capacity and health; Aim 5 - To evaluate RPRC achievements guided by the RPRC Logic Model and Work Plans; Aim 6 - To further advance the respective research agendas set with the D/HOH communities. RPRC proposes a dissemination and implementation research project focused on obesity, a CDC winnable battle. The overall goal of this research, called Deaf Weight Wise 2.0 (DWW 2.0), is to adapt an evidenced-based healthy lifestyle intervention for use with Deaf adult American Sign Language (ASL) users ages 21-40, delivered either locally as an in-person group intervention or remotely as an individual counseling intervention via videophone (VP), and to assess the interventions with a randomized trial. The VP, an existing technology that is virtually ubiquitous in the US Deaf community, has broad implications for remote delivery of health interventions with Deaf and other populations. RPRC's overarching premise is that an evidenced-based healthy lifestyle intervention adapted by Deaf people for use with Deaf people and delivered by Deaf people will improve diet, physical activity and weight. DWW 2.0 builds on RPRC strengths including a longstanding collaboration with the Rochester Deaf community, experience adapting measures and materials for use with Deaf ASL users, and a successful research focus on obesity intervention with Deaf ASL users. DWW 2.0 is responsive to the Deaf community in that it focuses on: 1) obesity, a health disparity that the Deaf community selected as a health research priority, 2) an age demographic identified by the Deaf community for inclusion in health promotion research, and 3) scalability and the request that the benefits of RPRC research be extended to reach Deaf communities outside of Rochester. RPRC, a unit of the Rochester Clinical and Translational Science Institute, brings academic health center expertise to these issues. DWW 2.0 is consistent with RPRC's work with the Rochester Community Transformation Grant and local health department. RPRC activities match the PRC FOA aims and support the Healthy People 2020 Goal to promote the health and well-being of people with disabilities."
"9483217","AREA B: PRECISE DCE-MRI OF BRAIN TUMORS PROJECT SUMMARY This project will develop and validate an improved dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) MRI technique for assessing brain tumor response to therapy. Rationale: Historically, increases in tumor size or enhancement have signified tumor progression, and decreases in tumor size have signified treatment response. With the advent of novel chemotherapy agents, including immunotherapy, simple changes in size or enhancement are no longer sufficient to make treatment decisions. We believe that improved DCE-MRI methods can provide new and powerful biomarkers to image brain tumors and detect early response to therapy. This will enhance our ability to prolong survival in a higher proportion of brain tumor patients traditionally regarded as the most dire prognostic group (including recurrent high-grade glioma and metastatic melanoma), who are often left out of clinical trials due to very short life expectancy. Innovation: We propose Specially Tailored Acquisition and Reconstruction (STAR) DCE-MRI, in which acquisition and reconstruction are tailored from an estimation- theoretic point of view to create the most accurate and reproducible tracer kinetic (TK) parameter maps, unlike conventional approaches that optimize the quality of intermediate images. We will fully integrate TK models with DCE-MRI acquisition and reconstruction. Our preliminary data shows 36-fold improvement in spatial resolution and coverage compared to current techniques, with no loss of image quality in brain tumor patients; and we expect to only get better. Compared to current state-of-the-art DCE-MRI, this technique will provide three major advances: 1- exquisite (sub-1 mm isotropic) spatial resolution to quantitatively assess narrow tumor margins and small lesions, 2- whole-brain coverage including all lesions and all surrounding tissue thereby simplifying the exam, 3- robust measurement of patient specific arterial inputs which are required for accurate contrast agent kinetic modeling. Approach: We will optimize, technically validate, and clinically evaluate STAR DCE-MRI method that provides improved quantitative parametric brain maps including blood- brain barrier leakage and fractional plasma volume. Specifically, we will: 1- optimize and technically validate STAR DCE-MRI to produce accurate and reproducible TK parameter maps, 2- produce a robust clinical implementation of STAR DCE-MRI, and 3- clinically evaluate STAR DCE-MRI in patients with brain tumors, specifically those with recurrent high-grade glioma treated with an anti-angiogenic agent, and those with brain melanoma metastases treated with an immunotherapy agent. Broader Impact: Improved quantitative multi- parametric DCE-MRI has a potential role in the assessment of all neurologic diseases that have a microvascular component. This technical work, particularly leveraging specific nonlinear temporal models during image reconstruction, is likely to have implications for DCE-MRI of prostate, renal, breast, and liver tumors as well as outside of DCE-MRI. Importantly it addresses a critical unmet need in oncology in providing a robust, reproducible, high spatio-temporal resolution and high spatial coverage biomarker as a potential end point for clinical trials of novel therapeutic agents in cancer research."
"9349118","PROJECT SUMMARY The skin microbiome represents the consortium of bacteria, viruses, fungi, and archaea living on our skin that has been shown to play an active and intimate role in shaping cutaneous health. Modulation of the skin milieu, whether host or microbial, provides a unique opportunity for innovative new therapeutics for skin and infectious disease prevention and treatment. Our long-term goal is to create new microbiome-based therapeutics that can integrate into the skin ecosystem and stably and continuously remediate the skin. Yet the integration of exogenous probiotics to an existing community has had little lasting success to date in either skin (or gut) communities, likely due to competitive barriers from other microbes or host exclusion by immune selection. Little is known about how potential probiotic strains integrate into an existing community and whether probiotics can be engineered to improve their entry and retention into an existing microbial community. Yet these are fundamental questions that must be answered to develop effective engineered probiotics. In this proposal, we will use a combination of high-throughput phenotyping, genomics, imaging, CRISPR-mediated genetic screens and computational modeling to define the rules that govern probiotic integration into an existing human skin microbiome in skin organoids and gnotobiotic mouse models. We will use these data to create and validate a predictive algorithm that, given microbial community and clinical data, suggests the best probiotic strain for that individual, skin site, or disease state, and predicts subsequent integration efficacy and impact on the endogenous microbial community. These data will also provide, by far, the deepest investigation to date into the ecology and genetics underlying skin microbial interactions. We will obtain new insights into the biological and genetic factors that may limit a probiotic?s efficacy in the skin. This will inform rational selection and engineering of probiotic strains, and will be applied to predicting community resilience to invading pathogens."
"9350923","Project summary Emerging evidence suggests that cells in multicellular organisms can rapidly adapt to changing environmental inputs or metabolic states by dynamically modifying their epigenome and gene expression programs. A major focus in my lab is to investigate the molecular underpinning regulating the interaction between environment and epigenome and how environmental inputs such as oxygen regulate developmental processes or human pathologies through modifying epigenetic marks in the genome. Key epigenetic enzymes such as ten-elven translocation (TET) family of DNA dioxygenase and JmjC-domain-containing histone demethylase directly utilize oxygen as one of their cofactors to modify epigenetic marks on DNA or histone. Depending on their specific microenvironments, cells of the same cellular identity may encounter different oxygen levels and therefore adopt distinct epigenomic and transcriptomic profiles. However, the molecular principles governing environment- epigenome interactions are largely unknown because we do not have methods to precisely map epigenomic responses to continuously distributed environmental inputs and manipulate the epigenome in the context of specific cellular microenvironment. Here we propose to overcome these technical challenges by developing integrated single-cell analysis approach to observe epigenomic and transcriptomic responses to dynamically changing environmental inputs and building a new class of `environment-sensing' synthetic epigenetic enzymes. Armed with these tools, we will have the ability to observe and actively manipulate the interaction between environmental inputs and epigenome `on demand', providing fundamentally new opportunities to study the critical changes in epigenome that are involved in a broad array of biological and pathological processes. !"
"9311640","The goal of this research is to understand the molecular and mechanistic basis of G protein activation, G protein-effector interaction, regulation of GTP hydrolysis, and G protein inhibition. We will investigate the conformational changes G? undergoes from the receptor-bound nucleotide-free G protein complex to the GTP- bound G protein state, the conformational changes that mediate subunit dissociation following GTP binding and the key allosteric interactions needed to terminate the active state of G? with its effectors and RGS proteins. Our hypothesis is that the dynamic regions of G? are critical for its interactions with other proteins throughout the G protein cycle, and these regions can be understood by examining their energetics at the single-amino acid level and probed using mutagenesis, biophysical and structural techniques. We will use an iterative loop between crystallographic approaches, EPR/DEER studies, structural modeling, sequence conservation, evolutionary coupling analysis, mutagenesis and functional assays to discern the role of each residue in the allosteric, intramolecular path of the G protein from the nucleotide binding pocket to its distal interaction sites with partner proteins. To explore the local dynamics and environment of specific regions, biochemical and biophysical data will be used in a continuous feedback cycle with the structural and sequence- derived computation efforts to fine-tune our predictions. In addition, evolutionary conservation, co-evolution, and statistical coupling of residue pairs across chordate phylogeny will be employed to discern how those network mechanisms are conserved yet still selective within each G? subtype. In this grant period, we will seek in specific aim 1 to identify the mechanism and sequence of GTP binding and helical domain closing. In specific aim 2, we will investigate how GTP binding leads to the dissociation of G? from R* and G??. Finally, in specific aim 3, we will identify allosteric interactions necessary for GTP hydrolysis and effector interaction. In particular, we will use our innovative, transdisciplinary approaches to understand how the G?i-RGS4 complex differs from the G?t - RGS9 - PDE? complex, where effector interaction is required for GTP hydrolysis in rod photoreceptors. These studies will lead to a more complete picture of the functional role the Switch regions play, give insight into the mechanism of GTP-dependent dissociation of G? from G?? and the receptor, and will probe the allosteric mechanisms required for effector and RGS interactions culminating in GTP hydrolysis. This iterative, integrated structural biology approach aims to capture the magnitude, direction, and dynamics of the conformational changes in G proteins and the allosteric basis of their interaction with partner proteins."

(3) Interactions of the Immune System and the Nervous System. The partnership is realized by the synergistic, coordinated activity of three distinct groups: (A) museums and schools, (B) intellectual partners, (C) production partners. (A) The new project will include the Carnegie Science Center, joined by Winchester Thurston Independent School (enrollment 650) and Pittsburgh Public Schools (enrollment 29,000, nearly 60% African American), as well as special resources like the Science Rocks Mobile Lab (CTSI/CTSA). While complex health and science learning goals are typically studied in middle school, we have found that younger students are very capable of understanding and appreciating the underlying fundamental principles when presented in a manner that is both accessible and meaningful to the child. We believe that building a stronger fundamental understanding of neuroscience early on will dramatically enhance the learning that can be achieved later in middle school. (B) The intellectual and medical partnership include the Clinical and Translational Science Institute at the University of Pittsburgh (a CTSA); Chronic Pain Research Consortium at Duquesne University and the Center for Pain Research, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine. Additional colleagues from the Duquesne University School of Education, the Liberal Arts College Department of Multimedia, and the Center for Health Care Ethics will participate. Colleagues from the McGowan Institute for Regenerative Medicine, University of Pittsburgh will also contribute their expertise. (C) The production partnership includes our staff of multimedia experts and the Entertainment Technology Center, Carnegie Mellon University. An external advisory committee will provide oversight and guidance. Independent evaluators including Rockman et al will work with us to contribute formative and summative evaluations of audience knowledge and attitudes, as well as a small-scale randomized-control trial."
"9278780","In this renewal application, we will build on the successes of the past project period to further examine the biological, social, and economic conditions that shape health in the aging population of South Africa. Our program, Health and Aging in Africa: Longitudinal Studies of an INDEPTH Community (HAALSI) completed its initial 3-year grant period with the establishment of a community-based cohort with baseline data for 5,059 men and women ?40 years of age in the International Network for the Demographic Evaluation of Populations and Their Health in Developing Countries (INDEPTH) community of Agincourt, South Africa. The response rate to the baseline survey was 86%. We use the infrastructure and tools already in place for follow- up surveillance of the HAALSI cohort, and we anticipate very minimal loss to follow-up for data collection moving forward. We propose to conduct two waves of follow-up data collection at three-year intervals, allowing the longitudinal analysis of three waves of data collection and six years of follow-up for morbidity, mortality, biological, behavioral, and environmental risk factors, and physical and cognitive function. The proposed HAALSI Program includes five projects: Project 1: Alzheimer?s Disease and Related Dementias and Cognitive Impairment; Project 2: Cardiometabolic Disease in an Aging South African Cohort; Project 3: HIV and HIV Interventions to Promote Healthy Aging; Project 4: Public Policies to Improve Healthy Aging; and Project 5: Multimorbidity. The projects will be supported by four cores: Leadership and Administration (Core A), Field (Core B), Data Management and Analysis (Core C), Biomarkers and Biobanking (Core D). Each of these projects and cores will be led by investigators from both the U.S. and South Africa. All projects will share a common household and participant survey and assessment and have aims that are tightly integrated across projects to create a synergistic and dynamic program. The study design used by the HAALSI Program is finely tuned to capture characteristics specific to South Africa as well as harmonize with other HRS sister studies in India, China, Brazil, the UK, Europe, and the U.S., providing a unique opportunity to conduct cross-country comparisons of the biological, social, and economic determinants of chronic diseases and their effects on functional and health outcomes in aging populations. Such cross-country harmonized comparisons will enable scientists to identify new risk factors and understand the impact of known risk factors on a global scale. Our study will inform the current debate about whether ?standard? risk factors in highly industrialized Western countries have the same effects on health outcomes in non-Western, low income countries. Our study sets out to identify and examine the distribution of both novel and established risk factors for chronic health conditions and conduct a follow-up study to discover the predictive value of the identified biological, social, and environmental risk factors. We have built a strong set of experimental aims into this application focusing on the evaluation of public policies aimed at reducing health risks, which has direct relevance to health in the U.S."
"9420455","Project Summary The rapid formation of new memories and the recall of old memories to inform decisions is essential for human cognition, but the underlying neural mechanisms remain poorly understood. The long-term goal of this research is a circuit-level understanding of human memory to enable the development of new treatments for the devastating effects of memory disorders. Our experiments utilize the rare opportunity to record in-vivo from human single neurons simultaneously in multiple brain areas in patients undergoing treatment for drug resistant epilepsy. The overall objective is to assemble a multi-institutional (Cedars-Sinai/Caltech, Johns Hopkins, U Toronto, Children?s/Harvard), integrated, and multi-disciplinary team. Jointly, we have the expertise and patient volume to test key predictions on the neural substrate of human memory. We will utilize a combination of (i) in- vivo recordings in awake behaving humans assessing memory strength through confidence ratings, (ii) focal electrical stimulation to test causality, and (iii) computational analysis and modeling. We will apply these techniques to investigate three overarching hypothesis on the mechanisms of episodic memory. First, we will test the prediction that stimulus-specific persistent activity is essential for memory formation (Aim 1). Second, we will determine whether neurons accumulate memory-derived evidence to inform retrieval decisions and/or the confidence (a type of metacognition) about retrieval decisions (Aim 2). Third, we will test the hypothesis that visually-and memory selective cells emerge gradually during temporally extended episodes of experience to gradually create and solidify memories (Aim 3). The expected outcomes of this research are an unprecedented characterization of how declarative memories are formed and used in the human brain. This work is significant because we move beyond a ?parts list? of neurons and brain areas by testing circuit-based hypothesis by simultaneously recording single-neurons from multiple frontal cortical and subcortical temporal lobe areas in humans who are forming, declaring and describing their memories. The proposed work is unusually innovative because we combine single-neuron recordings in multiple areas in behaving humans, develop new methods for non-invasive localization of implanted electrodes and electrical stimulation and directly test long-standing theoretical predictions on the role of evidence accumulation in memory retrieval. A second significant innovation is our team, which combines the patient volume and expertise of several major centers to maximally utilize the rare neurosurgical opportunities available to directly study the human nervous system. This innovative approach permits us to investigate circuit-level mechanisms of human memory that cannot be studied non-invasively in humans nor in animal models due to their unclear relevance to human memory and its diseases. This integrated multi-disciplinary combination of human in-vivo single-neuron physiology, behavior, and modeling will contribute significantly to our understanding of the circuits and patterns of neural activity that give rise to human memory, which is a central goal of human neuroscience in general and the BRAIN initiative in particular."

INTEGRATED HEALTH SCIENCES FACILITY CORE: ABSTRACT The Integrative Health Sciences Facility Core (IHSFC) will provide infrastructure and highly focused trans- disciplinary services to CACHET including study design; participant recruitment and enrollment; data collection and management; collection, processing and storage of biologic and environmental samples; and innovative approaches to exposure estimation using both traditional and cutting-edge techniques. This array of services will provide tools to translate fundamental research into knowledge supporting disease prevention and the mitigation of racial/ethnic environmental health disparities. The IHSFC will have leadership at both University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC) and University of Chicago (UofC), and will build upon the existing research resources at these institutions to ensure that Core support is used for the development of additional resources that are key to conducting EHS work. Many of the resources that the IHSFC will use to meet the environmental health sciences (EHS) translational research needs of CACHET investigators exist at our two institutions but will be modified, centralized and efficiently organized between the two institutions by leveraging the institution-specific strengths. IHSFC personnel include experts in epidemiological study design, population exposure studies, specimen collection and quality assurance, and environmental exposure assessment. IHSFC personnel will collaborate with personnel in the Statistics and Modeling Facility Core to address the needs of CACHET investigators requiring statistical services for the planning, implementation and analysis of EHS studies as well as personnel in the Biomarkers Core (BC) to address molecular assay requirements involving biomarkers of environmental exposures and environmental signatures in human biological materials. The IHSFC will also provide interpretation of results and facilitate dissemination of the results to Chicago communities and beyond in conjunction with the Community Outreach and Engagement Core (COEC). In addition, the IHSFC will work with the COEC as well as relevant Institutional CTSA and Cancer Center Cores to translate community-based EHS questions and concerns into specific scientific hypotheses that may be supported by CACHET through the Pilot Project Program."
"9564542","Evaluation of CCNY-RCMI Program Progress in Previous Cycle: Concept Systems, Inc. (CSI) was hired as the external evaluation contractors to assess the progress of the CCNY-RCMI Program for the funding period of 2005 to 2010 and to develop recommendations that could be incorporated in evaluation planning for the next cycle. Previous evaluations were limited in scope and rigor, and were noted as a weakness in reviews by NCRR. CSI was hired near the end of the cycle to help address these challenges and strengthen the evaluation approach for the next application. The design and conduct of the evaluation by CSI for 2005 to 2010 was intended to illustrate the degree to which the CCNY-RCMI Program had made progress in meeting its stated objectives associated with the RCMI funding. CSI assessed the progress of the CCNY-RCMI Program across seven areas: 6 constructs defined by the NIH/NCRR RCMI Program for the 2005-2010 cycle (Institutional Development, Organizational and Administrative Improvements, Research Environments, Research Infrastructures, Faculty Development and Achievement, and Research Productivity) and an additional area focused on Program Management. CSI employed a mixed-methods evaluation design and the seven constructs served as the guiding structure to meet the purpose of the evaluation. Three primary sources of information were collected and analyzed for the evaluation covering this period. These sources included ten one-hour interviews with CCNY-RCMI Program affiliated researchers and staff to gather specific information about their experiences related to program activities; several formal reports (PHS- 398; PHS 2590; Annual Progress reports, etc.); and an online survey of CCNY-RCMI Program affiliated faculty and staff. As noted in the full report provided to the CCNY-RCMI Program Administration and IAC, the data included in the year-end reports submitted to NCRR is subject to self-reporting by faculty and staff. Consequently, some of the quantitative data extracted from these reports may represent an under-report of performance across different RCMI-sponsored activities. The findings of this evaluation should be examined and interpreted in the context of the limitations inherent in the data sources and collection methods, which will be an important element to address as evaluation within the CCNY-RCMI Program moves forward. Overall, the evaluation results indicated that the CCNY-RCMI Program appeared to have made progress towards meeting its proposed objectives, as evidenced by data reported by the CCNY-RCMI Program on RCMI constructs and confirmed by faculty and staff perspectives. Moreover, the evaluators note the CCNYRCMI Program's commitment to implement an evaluation to document, and determine the success of its efforts to meet the RCMI program funding objectives. In terms of the specific objectives outlined by the CCNY-RCMI Program for the 2005-2010 RCMI proposal, evaluators noted that the CCNY-RCMI Program had accomplished its key objectives. During the 2005-2(110 cycle, the CCNY-RCMI Program: ? Hired new faculty members, with an emphasis on minority scientists in areas of scientific focus for the program ? Updated and augmented research instrumentation and support services for researchers across the areas of scientific focus for the program ? Assisted current and newly hired faculty members to develop research projects that will attract outside funding from NIH and other agencies ? Increased the biomedical research and research training opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students"
"9467120","Nonmelanoma skin cancer (NMSC) represents the most common form of cancer in the human body. The method for diagnosing and treating NMSCs requires removal of a biopsy that is prepared and stained for analysis on a standard optical microscope. This process is painful for patients, introduces a substantial delay into the flow of care, and represents a considerable cost to healthcare ($6.5B/yr) due to the large number of unnecessary biopsies. Zebra Medical Technologies (ZMT) aims to address the need for a better method to diagnose NMSCs by creating a noninvasive imaging technology capable of displaying histology like images of skin cellular structure in real time. In this project, ZMT will construct a portable, skin-imaging microscope for human clinical studies (Aim 1), develop software for data acquisition, image processing, and improved user interface (Aim 2), and demonstrate in 5 human subjects with basal cell carcinoma (BCC) the ability to detect pathologic features of BCC (Aim 3). ZMT is the creator of the only commercially available fiber coupled multiphoton microscopy (MPM) system for in vivo imaging of skeletal muscle cellular structures and contractile dynamics, the Zebrascope, which has been sold to three universities and one hospital to date. ZMT will adapt and optimize technologies invented for the Zebrascope to specifically visualize cellular structures in skin. The ZMT team possesses expertise in miniaturizing optical systems, designing disposable optical probes with highly repeatable alignment, imaging deep into living tissue, and conducting human studies with MPM under IRB oversight. ZMT has already proven feasibility of this concept with a bench top prototype that successfully imaged subcellular structures in the epidermis and dermis in living human skin and in excised tumor samples. Success in this project will lead to a larger clinical study in Phase II. ZMT views NMSC as a natural first target for real time diagnosis that paves the way for applications in melanoma diagnosis followed by other epithelial cancers such as oral, esophageal, and cervical."
"9385623","ABSTRACT  Since its inception in 1999, the CHAMACOS study is one of the longest running cohort studies examining the impact of early life environmental exposures on neurodevelopment, growth, and respiratory disease and the only one focused on low-income, Latino children in a farmworker population. We have collected extensive health, exposure, demographic, neighborhood, and regional data, as well as biological (e.g. blood, urine, breastmilk, hair, saliva, deciduous teeth) and environmental (e.g. dust, allergens) samples at multiple visits and have created a large biorepository with more than 220,000 samples stored for future use. With over 140 publications, CHAMACOS is a successful and well-established environmental epidemiology cohort.  We have used banked specimens and archived data to demonstrate relationships of pre- and postnatal exposures to pesticides, flame retardants, and other chemicals with poorer neurodevelopment, reduced lung function, obesity, and other outcomes. We have shown that environmental exposures affect a multitude of molecular mechanisms that influence health, such as PON1 enzymatic activity, adipokine and isoprostane levels, DNA methylation and miRNA expression. The CHAMACOS resources have supported multiple NIH, EPA, and non-federal grants and trainees, including collaborations with other institutions. However, the infrastructure required for management of this vast trove of data, the laboratory facilities to ensure the safety of hundreds of thousands of samples, and the effort to keep families engaged and participating in this long- running study have increased over time, while funding for these activities has decreased.  The aims for this proposal are to (1) retain participation in the cohort through community engagement, (2) maintain and strengthen data management infrastructure, (3) maintain and enhance the existing biorepository through replacement, repair, and maintenance of aging deep freezers to ensure the integrity of samples and improvements to systems to track samples used for multiple research grants, pilot studies, and collaborations, (4) conduct validation, pilot, and feasibility studies to investigate new methods of assessing environmental exposures, develop best practices for biorepositories, and explore novel methodologies related to metabolomics, genomics, and the microbiome, and (5) develop a data sharing portal to encourage use by outside collaborators of existing CHAMACOS data.  In summary, infrastructure support for the CHAMACOS cohort study will preserve specimens, ensure well- documented data for future studies and data sharing, and maintain participant retention, assuring effective future use of these valuable resources. This maintenance grant will thereby strengthen our ability to answer key questions about the impact of environmental exposures on health over the life course and will assure that the extensive resources generated by the CHAMACOS study will be effectively used by investigators worldwide for years to come."
"9347072","Novel 3D Printed Architectures for Oral Long-Acting Drug Delivery Systems Project Summary  Long-acting oral (LAO) dosage forms may offer significant benefits for managing chronic medical conditions requiring long-term and intensive medication regimens, particularly those in which observed therapy would be practical and advantageous, such as psychiatric disorders. Poor patient adherence and persistence to therapy are a significant challenge in the schizophrenia patient population, leading to relapse, hospitalizations, and loss of productivity. Extended drug delivery reduces dosing frequency, alleviates pill burden on patients and caregivers, and improves medication adherence. Compared to intramuscular injections, oral dosage forms may improve adoption among patients and clinicians and are cost-effective and more easily administered. Lyndra has developed a LAO delivery system based on a gastric residence technology that can achieve sustained therapeutic drug levels in-vivo for over one week.  Lyndra?s LAO therapies have complex geometry, multiple polymeric material components, and intricate assembly and manufacturing requirements involving extrusion, injection molding, and welding. 3D printing is an alternative manufacturing methodology with substantial practical advantages. Novel internal microarchitectures that can only be achieved with 3D printing (3DP) have the potential to overcome challenges with zero-order release kinetics and enable tunable mechanical properties to favor safe gastric residence and exit.  The goal of this grant is to develop a novel manufacturing method using fused deposition modeling based 3DP techniques to create novel microarchitectures that enhance the drug delivery and mechanical properties of LAO formulations of risperidone. 3DP provides precise control over the geometry and composition of Lyndra?s solid oral polymeric systems and enables easy modification of dosage form parameters to suit different drug profiles. We believe that this approach will produce high-quality LAO formulations with customizable release profiles and mechanical strength to substantially improve real world performance. In Aim 1 we will focus on optimizing architectures to achieve near linear in-vitro release rates. In Aim 2 and 3, we will focus on fabricating architectures with structural elements for improving the mechanical stability of the drug-loaded segments and the linkages connecting adjacent drug-loaded segments in the formulation. Successful proof-of-concept 3DP Phase I studies will lead to a Phase II SBIR that would include preclinical in-vivo pharmacology and safety studies, stability testing, GMP methods of 3DP manufacturing, and IND-enabling toxicology. Novel LAO therapies may offer improved treatment paradigms for patients with schizophrenia and other chronic diseases."
"9397604","Rationale: By 2014, 22 states had an obesity rate ?30% and none <20%. Costs due to obesity are estimated at $190B/yr. 72% of Veterans are overweight (45%) or obese (27%), of which 66% have hypertension and 31% have diabetes, the two most common comorbidities associated with obesity. Researchers use vagal nerve stimulation (VNS) to treat a number of conditions, including obesity. The vagal nerve is the parasympathetic branch of stomach innervation whereas the lesser-studied splanchnic nerve provides sympathetic innervation. Splanchnic nerve stimulation (SpNS) has also been used to treat obesity. Sensory afferents in these nerves relay information about the state of the stomach. How and why VNS and SpNS work remain unknown. Stimulus parameters vary widely and are often accompanied by side-effects. The limited success and undesired side effects are hypothesized to be due to the stimulus waveform. This grant seeks to understand the neural population code associated with stomach distension. It also assesses the effect of novel VNS and SpNS waveforms designed to mimic the neural population code and reduce side-effects on body weight in obese rats. Objective: The objectives of this study are to 1) elucidate the neural mechanisms underlying obesity and 2) develop and assess the effects of novel stimuli on eating behavior in obese rats. Numerous hypotheses will be tested through a series of animal experiments over a 4 year time period. Research Plan and Methodology: During Aim 1, in a series of non-survival experiments, the vagal and splanchnic nerves will be implanted with electrodes in rats. The rats will be healthy or made overweight or obese using a moderate or high-fat diet. The animal?s stomach will be distended with an intragastric balloon to mimic food consumption. Intragastric pressure will be recorded. Nerve recordings will provide insight to the neural response in the two nerves to stomach filling. The effect of diet and body mass index (BMI) on discharge pattern will be assessed. During Aim 2, in a series of survival experiments, nerve cuff electrodes will be implanted around the vagal and splanchnic nerves of rats. The rats will be either a healthy weight or obese. After healing, the rats will receive VNS, SpNS, or both using either standard time-invariant or novel time-variant waveforms. A time-variant waveform will be developed from recorded neural patterns and histology obtained in Aim 1 using 3D finite element models. Effects of stimulus location and waveform type on weight and activity will be determined over a 20-week period. Histology will be conducted to assess the effects of stimulus on nerve health. Immediate and Long-Term Career Goals: The immediate career goal is to become immersed within the field of obesity research and expand scientific understanding of how electrical stimulation applied to autonomic nerves can be used to reduce body weight. The long-term career goal is to become an independent clinical researcher with a lab at the LSCDVAMC that focuses on understanding and controlling the neural mechanism associated with obesity. Additional goals include 1) continuing to contribute to the local and national VA research community in the field of neural engineering and 2) advancing the body of scientific knowledge of how to interface with and control neurons in a manner that leads to natural outcomes. Future research will make extensive use of computer simulations, animal experiments, and human trials. Patterned nerve stimulation will be an expertise. Candidate Training: This CDA2 provides protected time to develop the following new skills: acute and chronic animal studies; animal surgeries; intraneural and extraneural nerve recording, processing, and analysis; electrode implantation; autonomic neuromodulation; clinical and surgical treatments of obesity;"
"9464120","PROJECT SUMMARY Underactive bladder (UAB) is a clinically important problem in the elderly. UAB is characterized by weak bladder contractions and incomplete bladder emptying that result in symptoms of voiding frequency, nocturia, and incontinence, and it can lead to serious complications such as permanent bladder and kidney damage. Aging-related UAB may affect almost 25% of Americans over 60, and nearly two-thirds of incontinent nursing home residents exhibit UAB. Globally, increased life expectancy is expected to increase the number of patients with UAB and lower urinary tract symptoms. The current standard treatment to achieve complete bladder emptying in UAB patients is intermittent catheterization. Although drug therapies are sometimes used to manage milder forms of UAB, those currently available have poor efficacy and tolerability and may not be suitable for use in elderly patients due to multiple side effects. A safe and effective product that facilitates efficient, complete voiding would provide a paradigm shift in the management of UAB. Dignify Therapeutics is developing next-generation potent and selective NK2R agonists to produce on-demand voiding as a treatment for UAB. Drug-induced side effects such as hypotension are a particular concern in the elderly as they can lead to mental confusion, poor mobility, and debilitating falls. Thus, a selective, short duration NK2R agonist would be desirable for use in this population. In Phase I, two next-generation NK2R agonists were identified that have optimized selectivity, improved pharmacokinetic (PK) profiles, and improved therapeutic indices. In this Phase II project, prototype formulations for convenient administration several times a day will be developed and tested for efficacy and improved side effect profiles in adult and aged preclinical animal models. Prototype intranasal (IN) and orally disintegrating tablet (ODT) formulations of optimized NK2R agonists will be developed and manufactured for preclinical studies. Qualified bioanalytical methods for plasma detection will also be developed. The therapeutic index, pharmacodynamic (PD), and PK profiles will be characterized following acute and repeated long-term IN dosing in aged rats and optimized ODT and IN formulations will be characterized in anesthetized and awake dogs. The proposed Phase II project will allow Dignify Therapeutics to develop an optimized ?on-demand, rapid-onset, short-duration, drug-induced, voiding therapy? to treat UAB in the elderly. This optimized therapy will reduce the risk of deleterious side effects by providing greater target selectivity and a reduced duration of action. This therapy would greatly improve the daily routine of elderly individuals with UAB, reduce UTIs and associated health risks, and decrease overall healthcare costs."
"9366092","PROJECT SUMMARY Adeno-Associated Virus (AAV) Rep proteins use a unique mechanism to integrate into its host genome using a strand-transfer reaction and also to process single stranded DNA during DNA replication. The large AAV Rep proteins Rep68/Rep78 are the key players that carry out this process using two multifunctional domains that include an origin binding domain (OBD) that binds DNA specifically and belongs to the family of HUH endonucleases; and a SF3 helicase domain. Integration is contingent on the binding of Rep68/Rep78 to the integration site AAVS1, promote its melting and perform a strand-specific transesterification reaction in the single-stranded region that has been extruded during the melting step. Little is known about the molecular details of this process and our long-term goal is to determine the molecular mechanism of site-specific integration mediated by AAV Rep proteins. In this proposal we will focus on uncovering the mechanisms of DNA melting and nicking using a combination of structural biology methods that include X-ray crystallography, small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) and single-particle reconstruction electron microscopy coupled to biochemical, biophysical and in vivo assays."
"9442907","PROJECT SUMMARY  Environmental exposures to toxic compounds rarely result from the action of single toxicants. Often, the toxic agent is a complex mixture of chemical entities in numbers ranging from a few, such as in occupational exposures, to several thousand, as in cigarette smoke. The long-range goal of the research supported by this grant is to develop an understanding of the mechanisms responsible for the adverse health effects of exposure to mixtures of chromium (VI) and benzo[a]pyrene (BaP), focusing on the mechanisms causing gene expression deregulation. We have shown that high-dose acute chromium treatment activates MAP kinases, interferes with the assembly of transcriptional complexes, cross-links HDAC1?DNMT1 complexes to promoter chromatin and inhibits epigenetic phosphorylation, acetylation and methylation marks established by Cr/BaP-induced gene transactivation in histones H3 and H4. These changes inhibit recruitment of RNA polymerase II to target promoters, and block inducible gene expression, increasing genomic instability, DNA damage and apoptosis while decreasing clonogenic ability. We used three different analytical approaches, namely FAIRE (Formaldehyde-Assisted Isolation of Regulatory Elements), DANPOS (Dynamic Analysis of Nucleosome Positioning and Occupancy by Sequencing), and ATAC (Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin), to test whether chromium could cause epigenetic changes in chromatin organization and architecture that could explain this diversity of phenotypic effects. With high statistical significance, all three tests showed that chromium causes chromatin domains surrounding the binding sites for CTCF (CCCTC binding factor) and its analog, BORIS (Brother of the Regulator of Imprinted Sites) to switch from states of closed to open chromatin or the reverse. CTCF/BORIS binding sites are the sole determinants of chromosome boundary-insulation in the mammalian genome, playing a critical role in transcriptional regulation. In addition, CTCF is also uniquely responsible for establishing chromatin topological domains and maintaining the 3-dimensional structure of the genome. Our novel findings lead us to the hypothesis that Cr(VI) breaks the links created by CTCF connecting genome architecture and function. Specifically, we propose that Cr(VI) disrupts 3-dimensional chromatin organization and boundary formation between topologically associated domains in chromosomes, destroying the interactions between transcription regulatory sequences. Based on these findings, we propose to test this hypothesis by determining whether Cr(VI) treatment disrupts the long-range genome-wide intrachromosomal and interchromosomal interactions established by CTCF and whether it interferes with the insulator function of CTCF and disrupts transcriptional regulation in CTCF-bound domains. The knowledge derived from the research proposed here will have a major impact on the biological and medical translation of epidemiological findings of chromium exposure and, by identifying molecular targets useful to reduce disease incidence, will significantly contribute to the development of therapeutic and preventative measures."
"9551215","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Synthetic systems that provide structural support while activating endogenous cells to form functional bone tissues have been considered as an optimal therapeutic strategy for treating critical bone defects. Currently, autografts and allografs are the primary choice of implants, but both suffer from various drawbacks such as donor site morbidity, scarcity, immunorejection, or disease transmission. In contrast, synthetic bone grafts with intrinsic osteoinductivity and osteogenicity could provide an easy-to-manufacture, cost-effective, and widely available therapeutic strategy for treating bone defects/failures. In the proposed study, we will investigate the efficacy of a fully synthetic bone grafts being developed in our laboratory to form in vitro and in vivo bone tissues. The biomimetic bone graft described here is developed by using principles of biomineralization, which leads to formation of a synthetic bone-like extracellular matrix that recapitulates various static and dynamic physicochemical cues of the native tissue including the dynamic dissolution/formation of mineral phase. Using this graft, we will: (1) determine the role of various physicochemical cues from the matrix and the mineral environment on osteogenic differentiation of stem cells in vitro, (2) elucidate the mechanism by which the biomineralized grafts exhibits osteogenicity and osteoinductivity, and (3) in vivo bone formation ability of the grafts by using posterolateral fusin as a model system. The grafts are designed to provide the structural and mechanical integrity required for bone grafting, while activating endogenous cells to promote bone formation. Such an endogenous cell-driven strategy in regenerative medicine has the potential to circumvent the limitations of existing approaches associated with cost, space, and time. Such an approach involving synthetic grafts devoid of any growth factors will also confine the bone formation to the implant site and overcome major side effects associated with growth factor-containing grafts. Though the proposed study is focused on bone tissue formation and repair, the biomimetic approach can be applied to study other cells/systems, thus having a far-reaching impact."

"9421099","SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Finding novel strategies to reduce healthcare-associated infections (HAIs), and Clostridium difficile infections (CDI) specifically, is a primary focus of the US DHHS and AHRQ. Improved terminal cleaning of hospital rooms is a critical imperative to interrupting transmission of HAIs. Unfortunately, the quality of terminal room cleaning achieved with standard hospital protocols is highly variable and inadequate. More reliable, intense disinfection has great potential to improve standard terminal room cleaning as a method to reduce HAIs.  HyperDRYMist is a novel disinfectant device that creates a submicron, liquid particle mist of an EPA- approved, sporicidal, hydrogen peroxide-based, silver ion-impregnated disinfectant, which is dispersed across all air-exposed surfaces. After an EPA-compliant dwell period, the mist settles and the air in the room clears below EPA standards for particle safety, leaving all impacted surfaces dry to the touch. The entire process takes 20-30 minutes. In contrast, hydrogen-peroxide vapor technology, in which the active agent is in gaseous form and is not a liquid particulate mist, requires 2-3 hours to safely turn around a room.  No patient or staff safety concerns of the misting process were identified despite months of use at multiple hospitals. Most importantly, in a 6 month, pilot, cross-over study, use of HyperDRYMist reduced the incidence of CDI from 4.2% to 0.6%; after cessation, CDI rates rose back up to 4.7% (prelim data). Thus HyperDRYMist has strong preliminary evidence. We propose to conduct a multi-centered trial to: 1. Define the impact of HyperDRYMist on HAI rates. Los Angeles County+University of Southern  California, Harbor-UCLA, and Olive View Medical Centers are public hospitals in LA that provide care for  AHRQ priority populations. A 12 month lead-in period will be used to establish baseline HAI rates and  study infrastructure, and to ship, test, prepare, deploy and train personnel on the equipment. During the  24-month, prospective, active-controlled intervention, single occupancy rooms in the hospitals will undergo  normal terminal cleaning by EVS with (intervention) vs. without (control) the HyperDRYMist device. After  the intervention, the relative change from baseline in the rate of facility-onset, CDC-defined CDI between  intervention and control rooms will be the primary outcome measure; secondary outcome measures will  evaluate other forms of MDRO infection; a direct medical cost-benefit analysis will also be conducted. 2. Define the impact of HyperDRYMist on microbiome ecology and densities in key areas of hospital  rooms. Microbial ecology on high touch surfaces in hospital rooms will be compared between  interventional vs. control rooms to determine the impact of HyperDRYMist disinfection.  This study will determine the potential for a novel method to routinely, more effectively disinfect many more surfaces in a hospital room than is achieved with standard cleaning. The availability of a simple, effective, terminal room-cleaning technology that reduces HAIs will tremendously benefit US healthcare."

"9302282","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Interstitial cystitis (IC) is a common entity with significant quality of life effects. However, the exact prevalence and incidence of IC is unclear a prior attempts to address this used solely administrative claims data or referral patterns from tertiary care referral centers. In order to define the national prevalence and incidence of IC, we propose a study using nation-wide data pulled from the Veterans Affairs (VA) Medical Centers, the largest integrated health system in the country. The goals of this study are to identify every IC patient within the VA system, to dive deep into the medical records of these patients to confirm the diagnosis of IC using a combination of automated data pulls plus hand-abstraction, to determine what other comorbid conditions co-exist with IC, and to assess treatment patterns and outcomes. By normalizing these data to US nation-wide numbers, we will be able to estimate the US nation-wide incidence and prevalence of IC. We will also prospective enroll a subset of these patients in a cohort study obtaining valuable quality of life data, patient-reporte outcomes, and urine samples. From this, we will be able to better assess the impact of IC on day-to-day life of the patients. Using the urine samples, we will explore whether biomarkers we have already identified to predict IC flare can be used to confirm the diagnosis of IC. Specific Aims are (Aim 1) Identify national-level prevalence and incidence of interstitial cystitis among a socio-economically and racially diverse population; (Aim 2) Prospectively determine the association between interstitial cystitis and health related quality of life and other comorbid conditions through validated questionnaires; and (Aim 3) Explore urine-based biomarkers to diagnose IC. If successful, our project has the possibility, for the first time, of clearly definin national-level prevalence and incidence of IC along with valuable information on treatment patterns and outcomes, impact of IC on quality of life and other co-morbid conditions, and even validate a biomarker for IC diagnosis. In summary, this study, by using an innovative approach to tap into nation-wide data, holds the potential to shed tremendous light on a disease of which to date we know very little."

"9488925","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) proposes to establish a Nathan Shock Center of Excellence in the Basic Biology of Aging focused on comparative energetics and aging. Energetics is comprehensively defined for this purpose as the study of the causes, mechanisms, and consequences of the acquisition, storage, and utilization of metabolizable energy. Comparative energetics is the study of metabolic processes at multiple scales and across multiple species, in this case as it relates to health and aging. Nearly a century of aging research has reinforced the link between energetics and aging. In modern terms this link is reified as dysregulated mitochondrial function, metabolic signaling, and nutrient responsiveness. The twin objectives of the Center will be to (1) explore in greater depth and detail than previously the complex relationship among cellular and organismal energetics and their relationship to health and aging, and (2) provide quantitative, state-of-the-art technologies and novel methodologies in the assessment and analysis of energetics to the basic aging research community at large. In pursuit of these objectives, we propose developing three research cores. First, the Comparative Organismal Energetics Core will provide expertise and cutting edge instruction and methodology for determining complete whole animal energy balance (intake, assimilation, expenditure) and body composition, including regional distribution of white and brown adipose tissue, in living animals of various species including flies, fish, mice or other mammals, under any ambient temperature or activity regime. Second, the Comparative Mitochondrial Health Assessment Core will provide integrated, quantitative energetics analysis at the level of the organelle, cell, or tissue for both traditional and emerging animal models, including targeted metabolomics, assessment of mitophagy, and oxidative stress. Mitochondrial-nuclear exchange models are also available to enable experiments that evaluate the contribution of mtDNA variation to bioenergetics. Third, the Comparative Data Analytics Core will provide innovative analytic approaches to data sets linking comparative energetics to organismal health and longevity.  With these research cores plus the administrative and research development core, we aim to: (i) facilitate hypothesis-driven research and leverage these technologies into new projects, interactions, and collaborations nationwide in basic aging research; (ii) foster meaningful novel interactions among investigators within UAB and across the region and country; and (iii) provide resources, education, training, and direction to junior investigators through the intellectual resources and research infrastructure, the Center will develop.  In sum, these cores and the outstanding cohort of investigators assembled for this Center will provide unique expertise and novel collaborative opportunities for new and established investigators at UAB and beyond."
"9482283","ABSTRACT: RESEARCH PROJECT #1 Hypertension disproportionately affects and is inadequately controlled among African American and poor populations. Health providers generally lack the skills and resources to address social contextual factors (i.e. health and community services, social networks, social stressors, physical environment, and economic resources) that influence management of hypertension. In prior work, we found that patients identify such social contextual factors as barriers to management of hypertension and are interested in working with lay health advisors to address these factors. We also developed and pilot tested culturally competent methods to train lay health advisors about hypertension and social contextual factors. We now propose to determine the impact of using trained lay health advisors to help patients address social contextual factors that influence hypertension management. Specifically, we propose a cluster randomized controlled trial involving 312 African American patients with poorly controlled hypertension at 8 clinics. Intervention patients will meet monthly in small groups with a trained lay health advisor. Lay health advisors will use an African American heritage theme as a framework to educate patients about blood pressure and hypertension treatment, will help patients better utilize their social networks or access health and social services, and will teach patients how to communicate more effectively with primary care physicians about barriers to hypertension management. Intervention patients within each group will also support each other in accomplishing these tasks. While our intervention is unlikely to eliminate fundamental causes of health disparities such as economic deprivation, segregated housing, or lack of affordable health care, our pilot work suggests that lay health advisors can help patients become more adept at taking advantage of the personal and community resources available to them. Control patients will continue to receive usual care for hypertension. Major outcomes after 12 months will include changes in blood pressure, hypertension knowledge and perceptions, medication adherence, health care interactions, and quality of life. We will also explore mechanisms that explain the relationship between intervention and changes in blood pressure, including the role of hypertension knowledge and perceptions (e.g. self-efficacy), specific health behaviors (e.g. medication adherence), and health care interactions (e.g. patient-provider communication) as mediators. The proposed project is a novel and promising approach to help patients address the social contextual factors that affect their hypertension management. Helping patients address these barriers may lead not only to improved blood pressure but also to increased survival, reduced organ damage, and decreased health care costs. The proposed project may also serve as a model for addressing other health disparity conditions."
"9350192","ABSTRACT Cells carefully regulate the destruction of bulk internal components through processes that include proteasome-mediated degradation and lysosomal autophagy. It has recently been appreciated that large structures are also subject to active autophagic destruction, including damaged or stressed organelles such as mitochondria (mitophagy), peroxisomes (pexophagy), and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER-phagy). But little is known about the molecular mechanisms behind the autophagy of these large cargoes, from sensing of organelle stress, to marking of target organelles, to delivery to the core autophagic machinery, and how these processes are distinct from the autophagy of bulk cytosol. Working in human cells, my lab will use next- generation CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing and regulation technologies, combined with cellular biochemistry and imaging, to discover the pathways that signal for the remodeling and lysosomal degradation of multiple organelles. We will determine factors that promote and repress organelle autophagy, the pathways required to execute organelle autophagy programs, build real-time detection systems to measure the timing of organelle autophagy in living cells, and determine the general and organelle-specific signals that regulate organelle autophagy. Starting with autophagy of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER-phagy), we have used specialized CRISPR libraries to discover several novel, ubiquitin-related factors that are required for the proper completion of ER-phagy. Systematic CRISPR knockout, endogenous editing, and gene re-expression studies will allow us to dissect the molecular mechanisms by which these factors regulate ER-phagy, as well as identify the adapters that connect ubiquitination/deubiquitination cascades to the autophagy machinery. We will extend these studies to investigate how cells regulate the autophagy of multiple organelles, with the goal of discovering general signaling principles that underlie the marking of damaged organelles and delivery to the lysosome. We hypothesize that these signaling pathways may be analogous to (though chemically or structurally distinct from) ubiquitin-based signals that mark individual proteins for delivery to the proteasome, with refinements for each type of organelle. Our work will reveal the mechanisms by which cells maintain organelle homeostasis and respond to organelle damage or stress, as well as provide new insight into diseases linked to organelle dysfunction, including Parkinson?s Disease, lysosomal storage disorders, and cancer."
"9552418","Project Summary/Abstract The fixed helmet design of commercially available magnetoencephalography (MEG) systems utilizing superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) magnetometers is designed to fit the 95th percentile of head size and therefore gives suboptimal measurements of the MEG signals for most subjects, especially children. A small head size will result in a gap between the helmet and head of several centimeters, and since the MEG signal amplitude decays as 1/r3, where r is the distance from the neuronal source, this large gap can result in signal attenuation by a factor of ~10. Therefore, placing the sensors on to the head will lead to increases in signal amplitude. Additionally, if sensors are placed on or near the scalp, high spatial frequency variations in the magnetic field will be detectable. Combining these factors, substantially improved spatial resolution in localizing neuronal sources will be enabled. Recent developments in sensor design now makes optically pumped magnetometers (OPMs) ideal for application to the field of MEG, and since they operate above room temperature and can be constructed as individual sensor modules, the sensor layout can be flexible. The long-term goal of this research is to develop a full-head MEG system based on OPMs that can conform to any head size to give the largest possible signal while at a reduced cost compared to cryogenic MEG. The objective of this proposal is to develop a 72-channel OPM MEG system giving partial head coverage to demonstrate improved spatial resolution in the measurement of nearby neuronal sources within the human brain. The system will be rapidly reconfigurable to concentrate the array coverage on an area of interest. Our central hypothesis is that the close proximity of the OPM array will allow a new level of spatial resolution for MEG. In Specific Aim 1, our current OPM-based MEG array with 20 channels will be expanded to a reconfigurable 72-channel system. The reconfigurable array will accommodate varying head sizes, particularly that of small adults and children, and the number of sensors will allow the array to be concentrated over two sections of the brain simultaneously. In Specific Aim 2, analysis techniques specific to the reconfigurable array will be developed. When the array is repositioned for each new subject, real-time array calibration is required for accurate magnetic source localization and external noise suppression. In addition, data simulation will optimize the positioning of the array and reveal the possible improvements in source localization due to access to signals of higher spatial complexity. In Specific Aim 3, the source localization precision between our OPM MEG array and a commercial SQUID-based MEG array will be compared. Tasks involving auditory and visual stimulation will allow us to study spatial variation of brain activity due to changing stimulus parameters. With the expected improvements in signal size and spatial resolution, higher fidelity MEG measurements for people of all head sizes ranging from premature infants to the largest adults are enabled, with broad ranging applications in neuroscience and in understanding and treating brain dysfunction."
"9348620","PROJECT SUMMARY: In its recently released report, Improving Diagnosis in Health Care, the Institute of Medicine (IOM) highlighted that most individuals will experience at least one diagnostic error in their lifetime, sometimes with devastating consequences. Compared to other healthcare settings, clinicians working in emergency departments (EDs) are particularly vulnerable to making diagnostic errors due to time-pressured decision-making in a busy and often chaotic environment. In addition to this, provision of emergency care to children is complicated by their unique needs such as weight-based dosing of medications, their inability to verbalize their symptoms and often, their dependence on parents/guardians even for accessing healthcare. There are approximately 25 million annual pediatric ED visits in the United States. A conservative estimate of 5% prevalence, translates into ~ 1.25 million potential annual cases of diagnostic errors in the pediatric ED. To date, there has been no systematic research on diagnostic errors in the pediatric emergencies. Diagnostic errors, when defined as the inability to make a correct or timely diagnosis based on available evidence (i.e. missed opportunities for improving diagnosis or MOIDs), have been investigated in adult, outpatient settings. Members of our research team have used electronic health record based triggers to detect MOIDs and study the factors that cause diagnostic errors. Our long-term goal is to better understand MOIDs in pediatric EDs to ultimately decrease their prevalence. To accomplish that, in this project, we will assemble a multidisciplinary panel of experts in diagnostic decision making, pediatric emergency medicine along with patient/family advisory boards to develop a pediatric ED relevant model to identify triggers and subsequently use them to measure the frequency as well as contributing factors of diagnostic errors in four pediatric EDs. Our project is significant, innovative, and timely because it will lay the foundation for development of error detection tools that can be used to provide timely feedback to clinicians, track institutional or clinician performance, and measure impact of error mitigation strategies."
"9536315","Expression of the recently discovered human restriction factor SAMHD1 is responsible for the infection block imposed to lentiviruses such as HIV-1, HIV-2 and SIVmac by primary macrophages, dendritic cells and resting CD4+ T-cells. SAMHD1 blocks lentiviral infection by preventing the occurrence of reverse transcription. The viral accessory protein Vpx, contained in SIVmac and HIV-2 particles, overcomes the SAMHD1 reverse transcription block by inducing SAMHD1 degradation. SAMHD1 is a dGTP-regulated deoxynucleotide triphosphohydrolase that decreases the cellular levels of triphosphodeoxynucleotides (dNTPs). Interestingly, cycling and non-cycling cells express SAMHD1; however, SAMHD1's antiviral activity is only observed in non- cycling cells. Our preliminary findings correlate the lentiviral restriction phenotype observed in non-cycling cells with the phosphorylation and S-glutathionylation state of SAMHD1. This proposal will test the hypothesis that SAMHD1 antiviral activity is regulated by phosphorylation and S-glutathionylation. The following specific aims will be used to address this hypothesis. Aim1 will explore the role of SAMHD1 phosphorylation in retroviral restriction. Aim 2 will explore the role of S-glutathionylation in retroviral restriction. Aim 3 will explore the role of SAMHD1 in the type I IFN response. Overall, this proposal will establish the regulation of SAMHD1 antiviral activity. Understanding the regulation of SAMHD1 is instrumental for the development of novel anti-HIV-1 vaccine strategies since overcoming SAMHD1 increases the adaptive immune response during infection of dendritic cells and macrophages."
"9352230","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Language and communicative impairments following stroke (aphasia) affect more than 30% of stroke survivors, with an incidence of over 180,000 new cases annually. The consequences of aphasia are far reaching and can affect psychosocial adjustment, family role participation, vocational opportunities, and the ability to function independently in society.  Recent estimates suggest that VHA outpatient clinics see 2000 new cases of aphasia each year, meaning that approximately 20,000 enrolled VHA patients and 100,000 United States Veterans are currently living with the condition. In response to this need, the VA Pittsburgh Healthcare System Geriatric Research, Education, and Clinical Center (GRECC) initiated the Program for Intensive Residential Aphasia Treatment and Education (PIRATE) in January 2009.  PIRATE is a clinical demonstration project that provides approximately 100 hours of cognitive- linguistically oriented aphasia treatment to community dwelling Veterans over a 4-week period.  PIRATE currently serves 18 Veterans per year in bi-monthly sessions. Resource limitations associated with PIRATE and aphasia treatment in general require that treatments be offered in the most cost-effective doses to those Veterans most likely to benefit from them.   The proposed treatment-effectiveness research addresses these issues by examining the dose-response relationship for semantically-oriented naming treatment, and identifying cognitive, psycholinguistic and neuroanatomical predictors of treatment success. Study participants (n=50, over a 4-year period) will be recruited nationwide from Veterans enrolled in PIRATE. They will have their naming performance measured prior to PIRATE entry, during each week of treatment, and at program exit/follow-up. A battery of cognitive measures and structural magnetic resonance images of their brains will also be collected prior to treatment. Participants' performance on trained and untrained lexical items and a standardized measure of naming performance will be compared across time intervals to specify the therapy amounts for which maximum treatment benefits are achieved. Their treatment outcomes will also be correlated with specific cognitive test scores and the location and extent of their brain lesions to identify cognitive and neurological markers predictive of positive treatment response. Treatment response will also be compared across participants with different psycholinguistic profiles, to determine which groups of patients show greatest benefit from semantically-oriented naming treatment.   The proposed research should provide answers to two interlocking questions: for whom  is aphasia therapy most effective, and how much of it is needed to optimize treatment  outcomes. These answers have the potential to set transformative new standards for how aphasia treatment is delivered within VHA."
"9552424","Chronic inflammation contributes to the development of gastric dysplasia and neoplasia. The mechanisms responsible for these events have been only partially characterized. One hypothesis is that inflammation and mucosal injury cause aberrations in the normal biological functions of gastric stem/progenitor cells leading to the development of metaplasia and dysplasia and, ultimately, to neoplasia. Both Intestinal Metaplasia (IM) and spasmolytic polypeptide expressing metaplasia (SPEM) have been associated with inflammation-induced gastric neoplasms. The bone morphogenetic proteins, (BMPs) regulate the growth and differentiation of gastrointestinal tissues. The BMPs are also known to inhibit gastric inflammation, cell proliferation and the growth of gastric neoplasms. The Lgr5 gene marks gastric stem cells and it appears to play a significant role in in the development of gastric cancer. An increased number of Lgr5+ve cells has been detected in gastric tumors. The mechanisms that regulate the function of Lgr5+ve cells and their role in the development of gastric neoplasia are currently unknown. In preliminary studies conducted in mice, we observed Lgr5+ve cells at the base of antral glands and along the lesser curvature, an area that frequently gives rise to gastric neoplasms. We reported that inhibition of BMP signaling in the oxyntic mucosa by transgenic expression of the BMP inhibitor noggin (H+/K+-Nog mice), enhances Helicobacter-induced inflammation and it induces a pro- oncogenic environment characterized by increased epithelial cell proliferation and by the development of SPEM and of dysplastic changes of the gastric mucosa. We also showed that transgenic expression of noggin and deletion of the BMP receptor BMPR1A in Lgr5+ve cells, lead to an increase in Lgr5 gene expression and in the number of Lgr5+ve cells. Lineage tracing studies conducted in the presence of both noggin and H. felis demonstrated expression of markers of SPEM in Lgr5-derived cells. Moreover, deletion of BMPR1A and infection with H. felis, caused the development of dysplasia and of significant cellular changes of the gastric mucosa. The overall goal of this application is to investigate the role of BMP signaling in the regulation of Lgr5 cell homeostasis during gastric inflammation. We will test the hypothesis that inflammation and inhibition/loss of BMP signaling induce the aberrant activation of Lgr5+ve cells that might give rise to metaplastic and dysplastic epithelial lineages, and ultimately, to neoplasias. Toward this goal we will perform lineage-tracing experiments using Lgr5-Cre mice lines crossed to both noggin-tomato reporter mice and to mice carrying floxed alleles of BMPR1A. We will also test the effects of cytokines on the growth and differentiation of gastric organoids, derived from both mice stomachs and human biopsies, in order to define the mechanisms that control the homeostasis of Lgr5 progenitors. To determine the significance of BMP signaling in human diseases, we will measure the expression of BMPs, stem cell markers and of components of the BMP signal transduction pathway in samples derived from patients with gastric cancer, gastritis and intestinal metaplasia."
"9421087","Project Summary/Abstract Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) is a surgical procedure that is used to treat the debilitating symptoms of Parkinson's Disease (PD). In the process of surgically implanting the stimulating electrodes, surgeons and researchers have a unique opportunity to measure and manipulate the activity of individual neurons while the awake PD patient performs a perceptual, cognitive, or other kind of relatively simple task. These studies are important because they far surpass the spatial and temporal resolution of state-of-the-art human imaging techniques and can yield insights into the basic building blocks of higher brain function, and how those building blocks may be disrupted in PD. Our proposed studies take advantage of this opportunity to establish a novel and sustainable research program to identify mechanisms of decision-making at the single-neuron level. We target the Substantia Nigra, Pars Reticulata (SNr), an output nucleus of the basal ganglia (BG) that acts as a gating mechanism that suppresses unwanted eye movements but allows wanted ones. Because goal-directed eye movements are used to select and attend to features of the visual scene for further processing, their underlying mechanisms must incorporate rapid and sophisticated decision-making. Ours will be the first research program to systematically test the SNr's role in these decision processes. These studies will have a major impact because of our use of: 1) our established and high-volume infrastructure and clinical program to obtain reliable SNr recordings and apply microstimulation in awake, behaving patients undergoing DBS surgery; 2) a visual motion-saccadic decision (?dots?) task that has been used with PD patients and is amenable to the kinds of quantitative modeling approaches that we use regularly; 3) task manipulations that are differentially sensitive to PD-related deficits, allowing us to gain insights into normal and abnormal BG function; 4) complementary studies in non-human primates that act as critical, healthy controls; and 5) electrical microstimulation to test if and how the SNr can play a causal role in the decision process, even with the BG in a pathological state. The proposed project has three Specific Aims. Aim 1 is to identify single-unit correlates of evidence accumulation and commitment in SNr of PD patients and monkeys. Aim 2 is to identify single-unit correlates of speed-accuracy and choice-bias instructions in SNr of PD patients. Aim 3 is to use electrical microstimulation to test for a causal role of the SNr in oculomotor decisions. Together, these Aims will form a solid foundation for a long-term program to understand how the dynamic response properties of individual neurons in the SNr and BG contribute to flexible decision-making. The use of complementary monkey studies is particularly noteworthy, allowing us to firmly establish the quantitative rigor and reproducibility of the human work. We will then build on this solid foundation to better understand the neuronal basis of normal decision-making, decision-making deficits associated with BG malfunction, and potential causes of and remedies to the cognitive side effects associated with DBS."
"9385667","PROJECT SUMMARY Water and air pollutions are two sources of environmental exposures that lead to significant mortality and morbidity across the world. Due to poorer infrastructure, inadequate regulatory enforcement and awareness, the health burden of water and air pollution is disproportionately greater in developing countries, especially in South Asia. This proposal addresses primarily these two environmental problems through targeted maintenance and enrichment of our long-standing environmental epidemiology cohort ?Health Effects of Arsenic Longitudinal Study (HEALS)? which was initiated by Dr. Ahsan and his Bangladesh and US colleagues in 2000. Thus far, the cohort has been mainly addressing research questions on the health effects of arsenic exposure from drinking water. By maintaining the cohort infrastructure with longer follow-up and ascertainment of new health outcomes, we will substantially enhance our ability to evaluate health effects of arsenic exposure. In addition, by extending our exposure assessment scheme to add a comprehensive assessment of novel air pollution monitoring, coupled with targeted biosample acquisition and outcome ascertainment, we will open new opportunities (to researchers at large) for efficient investigation of health effects of air pollution by taking advantage of our unique cohort infrastructure. Specifically, we propose to: i) refine our cohort maintenance activities by ascertaining air-pollution related health outcomes through targeted enrichment of clinical outcome assessment infrastructure; ii) augment the exposure characterization of the cohort by instituting air pollution exposure assessment infrastructure; and iii) enrich our biorepository by initiating saliva sample collection for future investigation of the oral microbiome in relation to environmental health effects. The HEALS resource has already been successfully used by a wide cadre of researchers investigating the health effects of As, dietary and lifestyle exposures and, if funded, the proposed enrichment and maintenance activities will open new doors for efficient investigation of the health effects of air pollution, the underlying biology, and prevention avenues."
"9455895","The establishment of neuronal connectivity requires the growth of axons and their synaptic branches. Following a period of growth, axon extension must be terminated and synaptic branches must be stabilized. The mechanisms that regulate this switch from growth to stability are mostly unexplored. We have identified a signaling pathway that can promote a state of axonal growth by inhibiting axon termination and branch stabilization. Moreover, we have identified a microRNA that can inhibit this pathway, thereby promoting axon termination and branch stabilization. We will use genetic analysis to investigate the role of this microRNA in promoting the switch from axonal growth to stability. MicroRNAs have been associated with many neurodevelopmental disorders. However, the roles that microRNAs play in regulating neuronal development are only beginning to be uncovered. We anticipate that our studies will provide a key example of how microRNAs can control neuronal development and will also identify novel mechanisms that control axon extension and branch formation."

"9355468","Project Summary/Abstract Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a disease characterized by progressive loss of lung function and is the third leading cause of death in the US. Treatments that target the mechanisms underlying COPD pathogenesis do not currently exist and present a logical avenue for new therapeutic development. Our group and others have established that tobacco smoke, the leading cause of COPD, alters the function of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), and that this ?acquired CFTR dysfunction? is also present in COPD. Genetic mutation of this ion channel is responsible for the etiology of cystic fibrosis (CF) which, like COPD, is characterized by progressive reduction in lung function due to defective mucus clearance. The FDA has identified several harmful toxicants in tobacco smoke, among which are reactive aldehydes such as acrolein, which we have shown in preliminary data are detrimental to both CFTR function and mucus clearance. Through the proposed studies, we will elucidate how specific chemicals within tobacco smoke alter CFTR function and mucus clearance in COPD. We hypothesize that acrolein and other aldehydes are principal components of tobacco smoke that inhibit CFTR function and contribute to defective mucus clearance, and that aldehyde scavengers can ameliorate these effects. To test this, we have developed three Specific Aims. In Aim 1, we will characterize how whole cigarette smoke affects CFTR-dependent ion transport and mucus clearance. In Aim 2, we will establish whether reactive aldehydes such as acrolein can recapitulate the effects of whole cigarette smoke in vitro and in vivo. In Aim 3, we will determine whether acrolein blockade using reactive aldehyde scavengers can protect against smoke-induced CFTR dysfunction and subsequent impairment of mucus clearance. These studies will advance the field by revealing the mechanistic basis underlying how tobacco smoke contributes to COPD manifestations, potentially leading to new targets and an innovative treatment approach."
"9334719","PROJECT 3 ABSTRACT: Major depressive disorder (MDD) remains one of the most prevalent and costly medical disorders. A third or more of patients may not achieve symptomatic remission despite multiple medication treatments; many other individuals are simply unable or unwilling to initiate prescription pharmacologic or psychosocial treatment. Complementary and alternative medications (CAM) represent an important option for such patients. In addition to understanding which CAM antidepressant strategies are efficacious for depression as well as for stress, the aim of Project 1, it would be highly valuable to understand the mechanisms by which certain CAM treatments exert their therapeutic effect. This understanding could increase the acceptability of current treatments, allow better matching of patients with effective treatments, and facilitate the investigation and development of novel CAM treatments. For standard antidepressant treatments, multiple hypotheses regarding mechanisms of action have been developed. These include (i) promotion of neuroplasticity, (ii) modulation of inflammation, and (iii) promotion of neurogenesis. To date, investigation of these latter hypotheses has been hampered by a lack of direct models of human neurobiology ? and particularly neuropathology - amenable to rapid screening and quantitative functional assessment. That is, it has not been possible to examine whether these hypotheses are supported in neural tissue from patients with the particular disease targeted by these interventions. Progress in stem cell technology and developmental neurobiology allows a novel strategy that forms the focus of Project 3. Dermal fibroblasts from 180 patient participants in the randomized trial of Project One will be reprogrammed (transdifferentiated) to induced neurons (iNs). Transcriptional profiles of these iN's will be compared after exposure to n-3 fatty acids, S- adenosyl L-methionine (SAMe), or vehicle to test whether the two CAMs regulate genes related to neuroplasticity (Aim 1a), and whether degree of modulation of neuroplasticity is associated with treatment efficacy. In parallel, a subset (10 per treatment arm) of patient-derived fibroblasts will be reprogrammed to induced pluripotent stem cells. These cell lines will then be differentiated into neuronal precursors and ultimately to mature neurons. Work by this group and others indicates that it is possible to generate such cells and incorporate them in high-throughput, quantitative functional assays to characterize phenotypes relevant to antidepressant mechanism. Specifically, the hypothesis that n-3 fatty acids and SAMe modulate inflammatory markers on neural-lineage cells (Aim 2a), and promote neurogenesis (Aim 2b), will be tested using validated assays. The hypothesis that these mechanisms are associated with treatment efficacy will also be tested. In addition to examining these primary hypotheses, this project will establish a critical resource for future investigation of CAM compounds, a biobank of 180 fibroblasts and 30 pluripotent stem cells and neuronal precursor cells, all derived from patients with MDD participating in Project 1's placebo-controlled investigations. NARRATIVE Major depressive disorder is a major contributor to morbidity worldwide, and existing treatments fail to yield symptomatic remission in ~1/3 of patients. While Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM) compounds are increasingly used to treat depression, and well-accepted by patients, their mechanisms of effect have not been fully characterized. The proposed investigation will test specific hypotheses extending preliminary data using unique patient-derived stem cells and induced neurons, while at the same timing establishing biomarkers, biosignatures, and a biobank to facilitate future CAM studies."
"9444850","OVERALL ABSTRACT MM is a plasma cell neoplasm within the bone marrow with significant complexity and heterogeneity at the molecular level. Despite improvements in the clinical outcomes achieved with newer therapies, wide inter-individual variation in response to treatment is a major limitation in achieving consistent therapeutic effects, or cures. Not all patients respond to initial therapies (innate resistance), and those that do frequently relapse with refractory disease (acquired resistance). The central hypothesis we are addressing is that rational therapeutic development in MM should be based on an understanding of the underlying genetics and biology of the tumor that identify sensitivity and resistance to current and future drugs. In this Myeloma-DRSC we are proposing 3 Projects that will: 1) develop a high throughput drug screening platform for myeloma cell lines representing the wide diversity of MM biology; and use this platform to screen primary patient tumor cells for most effective responses, including combination therapies; 2) develop a comprehensive mutational and germline variation panel that will be correlated to drug responses in vitro and in vivo, as well as toxicities; 3) identify the mechanism of response and resistance for two of the most common therapeutics used in MM treatment: IMiDS and proteasome inhibitors; 4) develop genetic and immunophenotypic signatures that effectively predict tumor response, resistance, and patient toxicities; 5) identify tumor sub-populations that may contribute to emerging resistance; and 6) identify strategies to predict drug resistance and approaches to overcome resistance."
"9444971","Abstract Hispanic/Latinos will comprise more than 30% of the U.S. population by mid-century, and Mexican Americans account for the largest share of this growing segment of society. This proposal aims to use door-to-door surveillance in Nueces County, Texas, a non-immigrant, bi-ethnic community, to determine the prevalence and trajectory over time of cognitive impairment and dementia in Mexican Americans and non-Hispanic whites. We will elucidate the mechanisms that explain the hypothesized ethnic disparity in Alzheimer?s disease and Alzheimer-related dementias by evaluating the roles of vascular disease risk factors, educational attainment and socio-economic status among others. This research will also delve deeply into the differences in informal caregiving for Mexican American and non-Hispanic whites with cognitive impairment and dementia. Caregiver burden and mental and physical health of caregivers will be examined toward efforts to develop interventions that build resilience in caregivers. A novel ability of this population-based study is to examine community resources for both patients and caregivers, and how these provisions differ by ethnicity. Using a rigorous mixed methods approach we will identify the gap between available resources and needs for those with cognitive impairment and dementia. In this way we will be well positioned to propose ethnic-specific testable interventions that promote mental and physical health for those with cognitive impairment and dementia, as well as for those family members who provide the care. This research will therefore lead to improved well- being, autonomy and outcomes among those with cognitive impairment and dementia and their caregivers. The investigative team members have conducted research in this community for 20 years and are experts in Mexican American culture and health, cognitive impairment and dementia, epidemiologic methods, community needs assessment and health behavior research. As the Mexican American population continues its tremendous growth and aging it is vitally important to better understand the prevalence and outcomes of cognitive impairment and dementia in this population, and to rapidly develop interventions that address the burden of these common conditions in Mexican American adults, families, and communities."
"9422820","Project Summary Abstract Abstract: The Symptom Experience, Management and Outcomes According to Race and Social Determinants (SEMOARS) Background: Black women with breast cancer in the United States have a lower 5 year survival than whites for stage-matched disease. Our past and ongoing work and that of others suggests that symptom incidence, cancer related distress and ineffective communication contribute to racial disparity in dose reduction and early therapy termination. Aims:1) Examine and compare chemotherapy received/chemotherapy prescribed over time and in total of matched black and white women prescribed BC chemotherapy. 2) Examine and compare the symptom incidence, distress and management, clinical encounter including patient centeredness of care and management experience of matched black and white women receiving BC chemotherapy over time. 2a) Correlate the symptom incidence symptom incidence, distress and management experience of matched black and white women receiving BC chemotherapy to Aim 1. 3) Explore the effects of social determinants of health including age, income, education, zip code and lifetime stress exposure on Aims 1, 2 and 3. Hypothesis: Inherent differences including race and possibly social determinants of health between black and white women in the experience, perception, communication and outcomes of symptoms during breast cancer chemotherapy interfere with chemotherapy adherence. Methods: Longitudinal frequent repeated-measures (18 data collections), comparative, mixed methods (audiotapes of clinic visits) descriptive design of 179 white and 179 black women from 6 sites at Western Pennsylvania and Northeast Ohio over the course of chemotherapy. Innovation: The intense assessment of symptoms, distress and quality of life and the clinical encounter in multiple repeated measures as compared by race and social determinants of health on the ability to receive full dose chemotherapy is patient centered and innovative. Significance/Public Health: If these relationships and racial differences are confirmed and the mediating factors identified as actionable targets, this information will fill a critical gap in the quality care literature, advancing the understanding and potential mitigation strategies for the static racial survival disparity in breast cancer. These identified targets hold implication for public health."
"9446226","Project Summary ? Project 1 Melanoma cells adapt well when transplanted to immune-deficient mice and the group has established >450 PDX, which allow us to identify in-depth those subgroups of tumors that are most suitable for selected drugs. The PDX have been extensively characterized for their growth properties in vitro and in vivo including metastasis formation, somatic mutations in 108 genes through targeted sequencing, and expression of 305 proteins related to signal transduction. The models are superbly suited to investigate two major pathways that are consistently activated in melanoma and in most other cancers: MAPK and PI3K pathways. Our overall working hypothesis is that we can predict therapy responses based on the genetic, genomic, and biologic signatures of tumors. We expect that we can define, short of a complete personalized approach, subgroups of melanomas that will respond to new therapies and new combinations of therapies in a predictable way. Using drugs that are available through NCI-CTEP, we will define in the first aim those melanomas that are most sensitive to inhibitors of MET in combination with MAPK inhibitors. We will also investigate multi-kinase inhibitors as single agents and in combination with MAPK inhibitors. Our working hypothesis is that in subgroups of melanomas, MET as well as other receptor tyrosine kinases (PDGFRß, VEGFR, c-KIT, FGFR1) and non-receptor kinases (SRC) are important targets. We expect to develop biomarkers that will pinpoint those melanomas that are most (or least) susceptible to kinase inhibition. In the second aim, we will define melanomas that are most sensitive to combined inhibition of the MAPK and PI3K pathways. Our working hypothesis is that a subgroup of BRAF-mutant melanomas exists, which is highly susceptible to the combination of BRAF/MEK with PI3K inhibitors. Based on our preliminary studies we will use loss of PTEN as one biomarker for selection but expect further refinements, especially for tumors resistant to BRAF and BRAF/MEK inhibitors. Since IGFR-1 signals predominantly through the PI3K pathway and is in selected melanomas a key player in acquired resistance, we will include the appropriate CTEP inhibitor(s). At the same time, we will determine whether isoform specific PI3K inhibitors are more appropriate in combination with MAPK inhibitors. We expect to define biomarkers for the selection of both treatment-naïve and BRAF/MEK inhibitor-resistant tumors. Our studies should provide a strong rationale for initiating clinical trials."
"9504274","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Alzheimer's disease [AD] represents a progressive degenerative illness that affects the brain, resulting in memory impairment. The complex etiology of AD is not fully resolved, although toxic isoforms of amyloid-? (A?) plaques are strongly implicated. Current treatment options are considered to be symptomatic. They are only moderately effective in stabilizing or improving cognitive and functional symptoms. Majority of the research into treatment for Alzheimer's focused on the protein beta amyloid, which is the main component of deposits found in the brain of Alzheimer's sufferers. Unfortunately in the past, many anti-amyloid drugs failed in advanced stages due to safety or efficacy concerns. Thus, there is an unmet need for therapies that halt or substantially slow disease progression.  Over the past decade, our continued research has yielded a system to treat AD. Our treatment strategy is based on the observation that A? peptides are in a dynamic equilibrium between the periphery and central nervous system (CNS). Our lead candidate, Amytrap, is composed of a retro-inverso peptide (RIP) that can sequester toxic ?-amyloid peptides A? -40 and A?-42 in the periphery, thereby drawing these toxic peptides out of the CNS. Our research studies have demonstrated the 'proof of principle' of this sequestration effect in vitro and in vivo. The research focused on evaluating the binding capacity of different RI peptides [Amytrap with different peptide sequences] to peptides A ? -40 and A ? -42 in vitro along with its effects on clearance of plaques from the brain in an AD mouse model. The results show that Amytrap is able to reduce A? levels in brain extracts from AD model mice. The reduction in A? levels was associated with improved memory parameters in these mice. Further we have observed suggestive evidence that administration of Amytrap to AD mice at younger age is more effective. This important piece of observation is consistent with the recent findings resulting fro failed/re-emerging human clinical trials. We have further improved the properties of this Amytrap system by linking the RIP to albumin. One of the advantages of the albuminized peptide is the absence of any untoward immune reactions. Recently, we have obtained additional evidence via imaging experiments that Amytrap does not cross the BBB thus reassuring our peripheral sink hypothesis. However, Amytrap warrants further investigation to test its potential as a disease modifying agent. In this phase 2 application, we attempt the next logical decision making point. We propose to conduct expanded studies on efficacy, genetic toxicology and safety pharmacology of the Amytrap molecule. Studies will focus on understanding the properties of Amytrap and translating them to practical applications which will enable us to commercialize Amytrap. Determining the minimum and maximum effective dose of the Amytrap molecule on performance in the y maze is one of our primary goals that will result in a therapeutic index. We plan to examine the genotoxic potential of Amytrap by standard experiments in vitro and in vivo. We will consequently conduct safety pharmacology studies and evaluate the effect of Amytrap on the CNS, respiratory and cardiac systems over long term. We believe Amytrap is ideally positioned in that it closely resembles its biological target. Further, Amytrap is safe and economical with no side effects. Therefore, we anticipate that Amytrap will be accepted in humans. The proposed commercialization plan includes a strong research team [including a CRO, well verse with IND enabling studies], a comprehensive business plan and commitments from potential strategic partners including Connecticut Innovations Inc [CII] and BioPharma Strategy Advisors, CA. To this effect, CII has already awarded a small grant to RT to fund efforts to bridge the phase 1 with the phase 2 research. The outcome of the proposed phase 2 studies is expected to satisfy mandatory requirements to position Amytrap for a future investigative new drug [IND] filing and subsequent human clinical testing."
"9472539","Combining incoming sensory information with previously learned knowledge is one of the fundamental computations of sensory cortex, yet It remains poorly understood. In order to investigate the neural basis of this computation in visual cortex we combine three key techniques. First, we employ a rigorous mathematical framework to make predictions about how the activity of sensory neurons should change with learning and depend on the task. Second, we causally manipulate the neural circuitry by eliminating those inputs that have been hypothesized to carry previously learned information. Third, we record the spiking activity of many primary visual cortex (V1) neurons simultaneously, with and without those inputs. We will combine these three techniques in three important scenarios. In the first scenario, we will measure and analyze how V1 responses change over the course of learning two different versions of an orientation-discrimination task. We will use this new data to validate our theoretical framework and compare it to alternative theories. In the second scenario, we will analyze V1 responses while the subject is multitasking, switching between two different tasks. This will provide insights into the source of performance limitations due to multitasking and into the basis of hierarchical decision-making. In the third scenario, we \'{ill c_on1pare V1 activity for sequential de~ision'.rnaking taskswh!Jn the brain over-weig_h_ts e§rly E)Vi_dencE) (displaying a 'confirmation bias'), and when it does not.

What is the source and role of correlated variability of sensory responses? What mathematical framework best describes sensory computations? RELEVANCE (See instructions): This project will study how the brain combines the visual information on the retina with prior knowledge about the world, in order to support visual perception and decision-making. Insights into the neurological basis of those processes will help us understand the effect of diseases such as schizophrenia, autism, and ADHD on visual processing and function."
"9470489","Project Summary Epilepsy is the fourth most prevalent neurological disorder after stroke, Alzheimer?s disease and migraine. It is estimated that about 3 million people in the U.S. and 65 million worldwide currently live with epilepsy. While a number of anti-convulsants exist to treat single seizure episodes, no anti-epileptogenic drugs are currently available to stop disease progression. Epileptogenesis (the process by which epilepsy progresses and develops) is associated with numerous pathological changes including neuroplasticity deficits, cell death, and a reduction in seizure threshold. To investigate the transcriptional regulators that drive large-scale gene expression changes during epileptogenesis, I used a bioinformatics tool developed by my advisor called the MAGIC matrix to analyze microarray datasets of dentate granule cells laser captured after Status Epilepticus (SE) in four rat seizure models. My analysis predicts that the Polycomb catalytic subunit Enhancer of Zeste Homolog 2 (EZH2) is the principal driver of expression changes during epileptogenesis. This is significant because Polycomb plays an important role during development, where it epigenetically and stably silences genes through histone methylation. Preliminary experiments in Aim 1 demonstrate that EZH2 protein levels dramatically increase after SE, while expression of its target genes significantly decrease many days after. Additionally, inhibiting EZH2 function in vivo using the pharmacological inhibitor, UNC1999, caused epileptic animals to have more seizures with greater severity over time. In the future, I aim to determine whether promoting EZH2 activity has the potential to alter hallmarks such as neurodegeneration, occurrence of spontaneous seizures and survival. This study has the potential to be one of the first to use Polycomb regulators to modify the process of epileptogenesis."

"9430563","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal will attempt to characterize how aging-associated increases in inflammation and decreased interleukin-7 receptor (IL-7R) signaling alter hematopoietic B-cell progenitor populations and promote the expansion of Philadelphia Chromosome (Ph+) cells. The incidence of Ph+ B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemias (B-ALL) increases significantly after age 50. This type of cancer results from the generation of the Philadelphia Chromosome, which creates a constitutively active kinase (Bcr-Abl) in hematopoietic progenitor cell populations. The expression of this oncogene results in unregulated cellular growth. Although the manifestation the Philadelphia Chromosome has been observed in all age groups, Ph+ leukemias are rarely observed in young individuals. Based on this observation the goals of this project are two-fold: 1.To determine the extent of signaling and metabolic changes that occur in aged B-cell progenitors relative to young populations induced by increased inflammation or decreased IL-7R mediated signaling; and 2. To determine if the aging-associated increases in Ph+ B-ALL results from the ability of Bcr-Abl to restore or circumvent identified signaling or metabolic defects found in aged B-cell progenitors. These studies will reveal how aging-associated increases in inflammation and decreases in IL-7R mediated signaling promote leukemogenesis in B-cell progenitor populations. Since age has been described as the single most important prognostic factor in the development of many cancers, this study may help to identify common themes that connect aging-associated cancers of varying etiological origin which could lead to improved therapeutics for various aging-associated malignancies."
"9313533","ABSTRACT The increasing use of soy-based products in the diet has raised concerns regarding their reproductive toxicity because soybeans contain isoflavones which exhibit hormonal activity and may interfere with reproductive development. The predominant isoflavones in soybeans, genistin and daidzin, are hydrolyzed in the gastrointestinal tract to genistein and daidzein aglycones, and daidzein is further broken down to equol. Of interest, the male phenotype is supported primarily by the sex steroid testosterone which is produced by testicular Leydig cells. In this application, Aim 1 experiments will test the hypothesis that timing of exposure influences the hormonal effects of soy-based diets in the testis. Male rats will be fed either a soy-free control or soy-based diet at different times in the postnatal period followed by analysis of serum hormone levels and correlation of the timing of exposure to the impact on Leydig and germ cell development. In Aim 2, PI hypothesizes that genistein, daidzein and equol all contribute to isoflavone exposure effects. Weanling male rats will be fed either the control, soy-based diet, or the control diet supplemented with genistin, daidzin or equol from 21-35 days of age. To determine if isoflavones interfered with steroid hormone regulation of the hypothalamus and pituitary gland, cohorts of control and isoflavone-exposed animals will be castrated and implanted with silastic capsules containing testosterone, dihydrotestosterone (a non-aromatizable androgen) or 17?-estradiol (the natural estrogen) from days 36-56 postpartum. Samples will be obtained for immunohistochemical analysis of steroid hormone receptor [estrogen receptors (ESR1, ESR2) and androgen receptor (AR) protein in the preoptic area and ventromedial nucleus of the hypothalamus. In addition, gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) receptor, steroid hormone receptors and gonadotropin (luteinizing and follicle stimulating hormone) subunit (LH? and FSH?) expression will be analyzed in western blots of pituitary glands. In the third aim, experiments will be performed to determine the molecular basis for organizational (permanent) effects of isoflavones in Leydig cells. Timed-pregnant dams will be maintained either on the control or soy-based diet during the period of primordial germ cell migration, i.e., gestational days 7-21. With male offspring as the F1 generation, mating studies will be performed to generate F2 and F3 generations of male rats. Mesenchymal stem cells and fully differentiated adult Leydig cells, obtained from 7- and 90-day old male rats, will be evaluated for developmental potential and terminal differentiation. In addition, genomic DNA and total RNA will be analyzed for DNA methylation patterns and microRNA expression. Altogether, results will describe how isoflavone effects impact Leydig cell development and paracrine regulation of testicular cells, interfere with steroid hormone regulation of hypothalamic and pituitary gland function, and identify epigenetic mechanisms which perpetuate isoflavone exposure effects across generations. These data will advance mission of the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences to discover how the environment affects people in order to promote healthier lives. 1   "
"9334548","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT International travel may not only increase the risk of infection for an individual traveler, but may also contribute to the global spread of infections. A better understanding of this epidemiologically important population could lead to improved interventions (1) to promote the health of international travelers, and (2) to diminish the spread of infections within home communities. This application focuses on proposed efforts for the Global Travelers' Epidemiology Network (Global TravEpiNet; GTEN). GTEN's mission is to lessen illness among high-risk international travelers, including VFR travelers, and to reduce the likelihood of disease importation into the United States. GTEN is comprised of two components: (1) a consortium of over 20 clinical sites that collects real-time data on pre-travel health care provided across the United States (since inception: over 80,000 records have been collected), and (2) a public health outreach program (?Heading Home Healthy?; www.headinghomehealthy.org) that includes web-tools and educational materials in multiple languages for high risk and VFR travelers, as well as a clinical guidance tool for non-expert providers who deliver the majority of pre-travel care to such travelers. We propose to expand upon the existing infrastructure developed by GTEN in order to (1) answer fundamental questions relating to the health care of US residents who travel internationally, and (2) improve the pre-travel health care provided to vulnerable US populations at highest risk of travel-related illness."
"9565022","PROJECT SUMMARY:  Circadian clocks are important regulators of cellular functions and homeostasis. Age- related alterations in the human circadian system are implicated in neuronal pathologies. Recent evidence in fruit flies and mice suggests correlation between disrupted rhythms and neurodegeneration; however, very little is known about mechanisms involved. To address these mechanisms, we compared circadian transcriptome in heads of young and old Drosophila using RNA-seq. We found that several genes that were expressed in young flies in a rhythmic fashion lose cycling pattern to become constitutively low or high in old flies. We uncovered a group of genes, which were low and arrhythmic in heads of young flies but became strongly rhythmic in heads of old flies. This group contains known stress-responsive genes that are induced in young flies in response to oxidative stress or hypoxia. Based on our preliminary data, we hypothesize that clock orchestrates rhythmic expression of neuroprotective genes, which we termed late life cyclers (LLCs), in response to intrinsic stress and damage in the aging nervous system. In Aim 1, we will measure genome-wide binding of the core circadian transcription factors CLK and CYC through ChIP-Seq and identify age-specific binding events that could be responsible for these regulatory changes. In Aim 2, we will measure chromatin modifications H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 as well as RNA Polymerase II binding using ChIP-Seq around the clock in young and old fly heads to characterize the effect of age-altered chromatin state and transcriptional changes associated with aging. In Aim 3, we will measure microRNA expression around the clock in young and old flies, to identify age-altered microRNA regulatory events that could result in post-transcriptional changes in rhythmic gene expression. The proposed work should reveal clock-controlled pathways that protect brain from age-related damage. Given the conserved molecular basis of circadian clock and aging biology, we expect these pathways will also function in humans. !"
"9240128","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Diseases leading to photoreceptor (PR) degeneration constitute a leading cause of untreatable blindness worldwide. Human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) hold promise as tools for the development of novel therapies for these conditions. However, harnessing hPSC technology, either for transplantation or disease modeling, requires detailed knowledge of the cell populations they produce. Studies supported by our present R01 grant demonstrated that hPSC-PR lineage cells can be generated from 3D optic vesicle-like structures (OVs) using a scalable, GMP-compatible culture method. Additional reports defined roles for key transcription factors and explored mechanisms involved in neural retinal progenitor cell (NRPC) production, maintenance, and differentiation. These studies helped support the authenticity of hPSC-NRPCs, an important first step in the examination of their PR progeny. We seek to extend these findings by examining hPSC-PR heterogeneity in culture, investigating mechanisms governing their differentiation, and probing their authenticity. The primary objectives of the current proposal are to a) define and enrich for PRs and cones over time in hPSC-OV cultures, and b) direct cone fate via genetic manipulation of selected factors. We hypothesize that hPSC-OVs employ conserved PR differentiation mechanisms and possess early cone-selective markers, which together can be exploited to reduce culture complexity and to bias toward the production of cones. To test this theory, we will pursue the following aims: 1. Identify, quantify, and analyze neural retinal (NR) and Cone Rod Homeobox (CRX)-expressing cell  populations generated over time from differentiating hPSC-OVs. Using a GMP-compatible hPSC line  and a gene-targeted CRX-tdTomato hESC reporter line, we will perform the first high content imaging and  single cell RNAseq analyses of differentiating hPSC-OVs and post-mortem human NR tissue to monitor and  compare temporal changes in NR and CRX+ cell composition and maturation states. 2. Enrich for hPSC-derived cones using cell-selective markers. Single cell data from differentiating hPSC-  OVs will be mined for known and novel gene and cell surface markers that can be used to define, monitor,  and selectively enrich for cones at multiple stages of differentiation. 3. Utilize patient-specific and gene-edited hiPSCs to selectively overproduce cone subtypes and  examine mechanisms underlying PR differentiation. Using information and tools generated from Aims 1  and 2, null NRL hiPSCs and CRISPR/Cas9-modified hPSCs will be tested to ascertain their suitability to  produce S or M/L cone-enriched populations to study PR differentiation and/or serve as robust cell sources  for future cone replacement strategies. Successful completion of these aims will improve the utility of hPSC-PRs for research and clinical applications and initiate production of a human cone ?toolkit? for widespread use by the scientific community."
"9365799","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT This proposed effort is offered in response to NIH Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) Number PAR-16-370: Phenotypic and Functional Characterization of ApoE2 to Inform Translation Strategies for Aging-Related Conditions. This FOA encourages a focus on the Apolipoprotein E 2 allele in the belief that understanding mechanisms responsible for its apparent protective influence may improve our understanding of why some persons escape the vascular and neurodegenerative ravages of brain aging, while others suffer impairments and a shortening of their productive lives. Our application addresses a specific hypothesis: that the several health and aging phenotypes linked to the individual ApoE alleles are differentially modified or mediated by other genetic factors that travel with each ApoE allele by virtue of their contiguity on chromosome 19. Instead of limiting analyses to the ApoE alleles by themselves, we will examine and compare the conjoint influences of the ApoE2, ApoE3, and ApoE4 alleles, each with two other genes and several other genetic polymorphisms, linked by common membership in a limited number of haplotypes. The associations of those haplotypes and constituent genes with clinical, functional, and neuropathologic indicators of pathologic brain aging will be examined in deceased participants from three longitudinally studied cohorts ? the Honolulu-Asia Aging Study, the 90+ Study, and the University of California San Diego Alzheimer's project."
"9444232","Project Summary - A realistic multiscale circuit model of the larval zebrafish brain The working group of the BRAIN initiative (BRAIN 2025, a Scientific Vision) identified ?the analysis of circuits of interacting neurons as being particularly rich in opportunity, with potential for revolutionary advances?. They further pointed out that ?truly understanding a circuit requires identifying and characterizing the component cells, defining their synaptic connections with one another, observing their dynamic patterns of activity as their circuit functions in vivo during behavior, and perturbing these patterns to test their significance. It also requires an understanding of the algorithms that govern information processing within a circuit and between interacting circuits in the brain as a whole?. We propose to generate a realistic multiscale circuit model of the larval zebrafish brain ? the multiscale virtual fish (MVF), which is well aligned with the BRAIN initiative's guidelines. The model will be based on algorithms inferred from behavioral assays and it will span spatial ranges across three levels: from the nanoscale at the synaptic level, to the microscale describing local circuits, to the macroscale brain-wide activity patterns distributed across many regions. The model will be constrained and validated by optogenetic interrogation and sparse connectomics of identified circuit elements 1? ,2?. The ultimate purpose is to explain and simulate the quantitative and qualitative nature of behavioral outputs in response to sensory inputs across various timescales, and to explore how these findings might integrate with parallel work in two other important behavioral model systems, ? the ?Drosophila larva and the rat. Our prior U01 project achieved the first instantiation of this model, whereby we successfully dissected the optomotor response (OMR)1? ?, where a larval zebrafish will turn and swim to match the direction of a whole-field visual stimulus ?3?5.? We will build on this model by achieving three further aims: First, we will expand the OMR project with four additional ethologically relevant behaviors: phototaxis, rheotaxis, escape, and hunting. We will extract the precise algorithms underlying each behavior and develop a version of the circuit model to understand their neural implementation. Second, we will further refine the model to account for multimodal integration and decision making, events that naturally happen when conflicting stimuli driving different behaviors are presented simultaneously. For example, a fish might be driven to execute a left turn by whole field motion moving to the left (OMR), while simultaneously being induced to turn right by increased brightness on its right side (phototaxis). Third, we will examine how internal brain states, such as hunger or stress, influence and modulate the specific behaviors (Aim 1) or behavioral interactions (Aim 2). Implementation of neurochemical modulation into the framework of the MVF will be achieved through simulation of highly conserved neuromodulatory neurotransmitter systems such as serotonin, acetylcholine, epinephrine and dopamine. To uncover generalizable principles of circuit design and function, we will compare our findings with those from two other model systems, the fruit fly larva and the rat. This will serve to elucidate the rules, motifs and algorithms of neural circuit function that transcend the potential idiosyncrasies of any given model."
"9381161","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT This study addresses the public health problem of chronic pain as one of the most feared symptoms in people with cancer, with 70% to 90% of patients with advanced disease reporting pain. Unrelieved pain remains a challenge in cancer care. Insufficient relief from pharmacological treatments and the fear of side effects are important reasons for the growing use of complementary pain management approaches in people with cancer. One such approach is music therapy. Although efficacy of music therapy for pain has been established, there are no mechanistic studies clarifying how it works in clinical populations. Thus, there is a lack of knowledge related to 1) therapeutic mechanisms that lead to improvement (mediator effects) and 2) the relationship be- tween patient characteristics and treatment response (moderator effects). Yet, it is well accepted that knowledge of mediators and moderators as well as a validated theory of action (i.e., how the intervention acti- vates the mediators) are needed to optimize psychosocial treatment interventions. Therefore, the overarching goals of this study are to 1) examine mediators and moderators hypothesized to account for the pain-reducing effects of Interactive Music Therapy (IMT) in people with advanced cancer and chronic pain and 2) validate IMT's theory of action. The mediation model to be tested in this study aligns with a biopsychosocial framework to palliation of chronic pain and is based on findings from a preliminary study. We postulate that anxiety, mood, self-efficacy and perceived support mediate the effects of IMT on pain outcomes (i.e. pain intensity and pain interference). In addition, we will test the impact of several moderators on the hypothesized mediation model, namely adult playfulness, perceived musical competence, and treatment expectancy. This study uses a mixed methods intervention design in which qualitative data (i.e. semi-structured follow-up interviews) are embedded within a randomized controlled trial. We will randomize 100 outpatients with advanced cancer and chronic pain due to bone metastases to one of two 6-week treatments: 1) Interactive Music Therapy or 2) Social Attention Control. The mediators and pain outcomes will be measured at baseline, week 4 and week 6 using self-report measures as well as biomarkers (salivary cortisol, lachrymal dopamine content, serum oxytocin, and plasma ?- endorphins). The follow-up interviews with a subsample of 20 participants will enable us to examine the con- gruence between the hypothesized mediators and moderators and participant explanations of how IMT influ- ences chronic pain management (i.e. theory of action). This study will contribute towards the optimization of music therapy for palliation of chronic pain in people with advanced cancer through a better understanding of the impact of mediators and moderators of IMT on chronic pain management. The results of this study will pro- vide estimated effects sizes of IMT on the mediators and preliminary effect size estimates for the pain out- comes. This information will be instrumental in the development of a subsequent large-scale efficacy trial."
"9455400","PROJECT SUMMARY Adverse local tissue reactions (ALTRs) associated with metal particulate debris and/or ions released from modular junctions and other metal interfaces (e.g. prosthesis/bone) are the result of immune responses which have presented as granulomas, necrotic tissue, pseudotumors, etc. Although wear and corrosion (?tribocorrosion?) have long been recognized as the problems endangering the long term survival of orthopedic implants, much remains unknown about the interaction of host tissue with degradation products. We hypothesize that metal degradation products resulting from tribocorrosion are dynamically bioreactive (i.e. time-dependent), where implant debris is initially highly bioreactive and then decreases over time as it becomes more electrochemically stable. Once validated in this study, our development of a ?Tribocorrosion Bioreactor? will allow direct mechanistic investigations between degradation products and cells, and will enable preclinical testing of meta-stable tribocorrosion products that are generated in situ. Here, we will evaluate if real time metal tribocorrosion products are excessively reactive aseptic stimuli eliciting both innate (macrophage) and adaptive (lymphocyte) immuno-reactivity and, thus, differ from more time-stabilized complexes formed from the same debris. Demonstrating the phenomenon of time-dependent implant debris reactivity is critical to understanding the clinical impact of freshly produced metal implant debris from both wear and corrosion. It will provide a significant leap forward into the next generation of in vitro testing of orthopedic materials."
"9446181","Project Summary/Abstract This project will benefit public health by ushering in a new technology to reduce MRI scan times. FRONSAC adds nonlinear gradients of modest amplitude in dynamic waveforms to standard Cartesian MRI protocols. This small perturbation to the standard Cartesian MRI scan allows for greater undersampling of data, and faster acquisition times. This proposal is innovative because it marries the reliability of Cartesian imaging with a small amount of nonlinear gradient encoding to greatly enhance parallel imaging acceleration. The proposal is significant because it will demonstrate that a single well-characterized nonlinear gradient waveform can improve undersampled imaging for a broad range of clinical sequences and scan prescriptions, potentially doubling overall scan throughput for busy clinical sites. The aims will demonstrate that, for many scan prescriptions, and even in the presence of common experimental imperfections or other parallel imaging strategies, FRONSAC further multiplies acceleration by an additional 2-4x. 1) Sequence development and optimization.  a) Develop a FRONSAC waveform, with 3 NLG channels, for a GRE sequence that maximizes  clinically acceptable acceleration.  b) Using this FRONSAC waveform, develop a set of widely used clinical sequences implementing  FRONSAC acceleration: 3D MP-RAGE, bSSFP, TSE and T2w-FLAIR. 2) Demonstrate FRONSAC imaging in vivo.  a) Acquire human brain images and compare contrast with conventional encoding.  b) Compare undersampling performance between FRONSAC and Cartesian encoding. 3) Show that undersampled images acquired using a FRONSAC gradient optimized for a single  geometry shows persistent improvements over Cartesian encoding for human brain imaging (for  different geometries and under various common experimental imperfections), and retains  compatibility with other acceleration approaches.  a) Test for undersampling artifacts when changing FOV, resolution, and slice orientation.  b) Test sequences with known (introduced) imperfections: gradient timing errors, imperfect shim, or  off-resonance spins.  c) Demonstrate compatibility with both kz undersampling and multislice CAIPIRINHA."
"9371039","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Approximately 50% of patients in U.S. hospitals experience at least 1 unintentional medication discrepancy and 52% of these discrepancies have the potential for significant harm. Medication reconciliation (MedRec) can reduce the number of medication discrepancies by more than 60%. However, the complexity and contextual barriers associated with MedRec have stunted implementation, and best practices to foster effective implementation and sustainability remain largely unknown.  Published MedRec studies usually have an inadequate description of the implementation methods and the contextual factors driving their selection. A lack of both long-term outcome studies and valid measures of sustainability have further limited our understanding of how to best sustain effective MedRec interventions. Identifying how implementation strategies and contextual factors (i.e., capacity, leadership, goal alignment, climate, readiness for change, and team cohesion) predict sustainability and long-term effectiveness of MedRec interventions, would provide important guidance for hospitals nationally and improve patient safety.  This proposal describes a career development plan that enables the candidate to gain expertise in advanced research methods and implementation science, through mentored research and didactic training. It leverages the AHRQ-funded, ?Implementation of a Medication Reconciliation Protocol to Improve Patient Safety,? study (MARQUIS2, R18 HS023757), which is investigating MedRec in 18 diverse U.S. hospitals, and provides a unique opportunity to study organizational context and sustainability at these facilities. The Specific Aims are: 1) Describe implementation strategies and examine their association with contextual factors; 2) Develop and validate a sustainability measure; and, 3) Investigate the relationship of contextual factors and implementation strategies with the sustainability of MedRec interventions.  The candidate is highly qualified as a PhD prepared nurse who has studied sustainability in other contexts. The career development plan builds on this foundation to provide: a) advanced skills in research methods (e.g., focus groups and multi-level modeling), implementation science, and instrument development; b) scientific writing skills through manuscript preparation and grant writing; and, c) an interdisciplinary mentored research experience with experts in implementation research. The institutional environment is exceptional, including research centers in implementation research and qualitative methods.  This career development award will allow the candidate to develop a deep understanding of implementation methods and expertise in measurement to study the sustainability of complex, interdisciplinary interventions in healthcare organizations. This award will position the candidate to become an R01-funded independent investigator who develops evidence-based implementation practices for optimizing the sustainability of complex healthcare interventions to improve patient safety and quality of care."
"9397703","Project Summary/Abstract Conductive hearing loss in military personnel is commonly caused by blast-related middle ear injuries, which can include tympanic membrane rupture and dislocation of the middle-ear ossicles. The current proposal seeks to evaluate methods and devices for restoring hearing not only for active-duty military personnel and Veterans who suffer from a blast-induced conductive hearing loss, but also for others who experience conductive hearing loss for various reasons (e.g., ruptured eardrum, birth defects, stiffening of middle ear bones). While these injuries are clinically treatable, the effects of middle-ear pathology on hearing are not well quantified, and clinical outcomes often fail to completely restore normal hearing for those suffering from a conductive hearing loss. The current proposal seeks to precisely measure the complex vibrational patterns along the ossicular chain and related pressures at the ends of the middle ear system; the umbo attached to the tympanic membrane and stapes attached to the cochlea, under both normal and particularly under various pathological conditions (damaged/repaired/reconstructed using prosthesis). These studies will use Laser Doppler Vibrometry, unique micro-pressure sensors and direct measures of otoacoustic emissions (OAEs). Aim 1 will evaluate the effects of systematically varied tympanic membrane perforations on middle ear sound transmission in an animal model. The role of the tympanic membrane in sound transmission will be explored and its influence on the motion of the ossicles will be characterized under varied perforation and naturally healed conditions. Measurement of distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs) following stimulation with paired tones will be used to quantify the effect of varying degrees of damage to the tympanic membrane. In Aim 2 we will measure sound transmission in an animal model with simulated ossicular chain pathologies. In addition, the effect of an abnormal ossicular chain on the production and acoustic characteristics of DPOAEs will be systematically explored in order to develop quantitative tools for diagnosing hearing loss and for use in the design and implementation of improved methods of treatment. Aim 3 evaluates middle ear sound transmission in human cadaver temporal bone models of clinically repaired human ears. Using direct pressure and velocity measurements, the functional differences between normal middle ear structures and two currently employed methods of repairing disarticulation of the middle ear ossicular chain, incus/stapes fixation or partial/total ossicular chain replacement using prostheses, will be quantified in detail. The proposed research will provide important information that will serve to improve our ability to specifically diagnose the causes of conductive hearing loss, direct the development of improved methods of treatment, and assist in the rational design of advanced prosthetics that more effectively restore hearing."
"9358721","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT There remains a wide gap in the US between the care children should receive and the care they do receive. The federal Pediatric Quality Measures Program (PQMP) was created to develop quality measures for diverse settings and purposes. Through the PQMP, we received funding to establish the Center of Excellence for Quality Measurement (CEPQM) to develop and test child quality measures. Working with multiple states and stakeholders, we developed measures in areas of critical importance to payers, providers, and families. For the PQMP's current dissemination and implementation stage, our specific aims are to convene a multidisciplinary partnership team and collaborate with Massachusetts (MA) and New York (NY) to: (A) field test two measure sets to ensure validity, feasibility, and usability for states, health plans, and hospitals, and further develop strategies to streamline data collection and measure reporting; and (B) use performance data to define quality improvement (QI) goals, assess intervention effects, and drive state-level improvement. We have selected two of our measure sets: (1) pediatric 30-day readmissions, comprising two measures, All-Condition Readmissions and Lower Respiratory Infection Readmissions, and (2) family experience of pediatric inpatient care, comprising the 18 measures included in the Child Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (Child HCAHPS) Survey. Both measure sets are harmonized with the corresponding adult measures used by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), other payers, and many US hospitals. Both readmission measures and Child HCAHPS have been endorsed by the National Quality Forum. In addition, All-Condition Readmissions and Child HCAHPS were prioritized by the Measure Applications Partnership in 2015 and 2014, respectively, for inclusion in the CMS Child Core Set. Our multidisciplinary partnership includes academic researchers; representatives from MA and NY health departments, External Quality Review Organizations, health plans, and hospitals; and QI experts from the Institute for Healthcare Improvement and National Improvement Partnership Network. We will also enhance our measures; for instance, we will test improving the readmissions case-mix model through including electronic health record data, and administering Child HCAHPS on day of discharge to increase participation. Our QI strategies will be grounded in the theory and practice of implementation science and will include analysis of contextual factors that affect current performance, identification of key drivers of improvement, development of intermediate process measures, and local tests of change. Reducing preventable readmissions and improving family experience of inpatient care are among the highest priorities for our health system. Through this project, we aim not only to advance knowledge about how to apply measures effectively, but also to produce strategies and tools that can be applied to implementation and care improvement in many measure domains and across the entire country."
"9377509","Project Summary/Abstract  Each year, approximately 800,000 cases of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) are diagnosed in the United States. Although PID is an acute disease, poorly managed PID has significant chronic implications; women with PID may develop chronic pelvic pain, ectopic pregnancy, and tubal infertility. At least 20% of PID cases occur in adolescents, who are at increased risk for subsequent STIs and PID. Many adolescents and young adult women (?young women?) fail to fully engage in self-care behaviors and adhere to the current Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) treatment recommendations. The proposed study will employ a convergent mixed methods design within the infrastructure of the Technology Enhanced Community Health Nursing (TECH-N; 5R01NR013507) parent study, an ongoing randomized controlled trial to improve health outcomes among young women with PID. The proposed study will engage 100 non-pregnant 13- to 25- year-old females diagnosed with mild to moderate PID to examine social support, coping strategies, and self- care behaviors required for successful PID treatment: medication adherence, adherence to the 72-hour clinical follow-up visit, partner notification, sexual abstinence during the treatment period, and consistent condom use at the resumption of sexual intercourse. Guided by the Transactional Model of Stress and Coping, the study will integrate quantitative data from structured baseline and follow-up interviews with in-depth, semi-structured qualitative interviews of participants. To support the study, the Brief COPE instrument has been added to the TECH-N protocol to measure coping strategies. The combination of quantitative and qualitative research will examine barriers to and facilitators of PID self-care, while providing detailed, contextual information to achieve the following specific aims: 1) Determine the coping strategies and types of social support utilized by young women diagnosed with PID; 2) Examine the relationships among coping strategies, social support, and engagement in PID self-care behaviors among young women; and 3) Explore the experiences of young women diagnosed with and treated for PID. The study is aligned with the Wellness theme of the National Institute of Nursing Research (NINR), in that it seeks to identify factors that promote health and prevent illness among young women with PID. Understanding the factors associated with engagement in PID self-care behaviors is critical for the development of personally relevant, effective outpatient interventions for PID that empower young women to engage in behaviors that prevent adverse reproductive health outcomes. The training experience associated with the proposed research will capitalize on the applicant?s potential and provide essential training towards becoming an independent nurse scientist, with an emphasis on young women?s sexual and reproductive health."
"9355959","PROJECT SUMMARY Blinding retinopathies constitute an urgent unmet healthcare need demanding novel therapeutic strategies. Retinal degenerative diseases are the major cause of untreatable blindness worldwide and frequently involve photoreceptor cell (PRC) death. Recently, we reported dramatic rescue of cone PRC function in the Pde6brd10/J (rd10) mouse model of retinopathy when mice were treated systemically with (+)-pentazocine ((+)- PTZ), a high affinity ligand for sigma 1 receptor (?1R). ?1R is a transmembrane protein considered a molecular chaperone involved in the ER stress response. Studies support the notion that ?1R modulates ER stress and Ca2+ signaling in retina. However, new data show that ?1R localizes also to the nuclear membrane of several retinal cell types (RGC, PRC, and Müller cells) suggesting that attenuation of ER stress may not explain entirely the mechanism(s) by which ?1R mediates retinal neuroprotection. We postulate that a novel mechanism underlying the robust retinal neuroprotection afforded by ?1R activation is modulation of the Nrf2- Keap1 pathway. Nrf2 is arguably the most important antioxidant molecule in cells because it regulates transcription of more than 500 antioxidant/cytoprotective genes. In the absence of stress, Nrf2 is retained in the cytoplasm by Keap1 and excess Nrf2 is degraded by the proteasome. However, under cellular stress, Keap1 releases Nrf2, which then translocates to the nucleus to activate ?antioxidant response elements? (ARE) of genes that encode numerous cell defense proteins and enzymes. Oxidative stress is a major pathogenic factor underlying PRC degeneration. It significantly increases binding of (+)-PTZ to ?1R. We know that (+)-PTZ treatment of rd10 mice modulates retinal Nrf2 levels, antioxidant gene expression and protein/lipid peroxidation, however we do not know whether Nrf2 is central to these retinal neuroprotective effects. Aim 1 will test this by evaluating the extent to which Nrf2 is sufficient and essential to rd10 PRC rescue. We know that ?1R interacts functionally with Nrf2-Keap1 in primary Müller cells; however we do not know the extent to which it alters function of or interacts with proteins in the pathway. Aim 2 will test this by evaluating the extent to which (+)-PTZ treatment alters Nrf2-Keap1 gene/protein expression, Nrf2 nuclear translocation, Nrf2 ARE activation, Keap1 inhibition, and Nrf2 proteasomal degradation in WT and ?1R-/- Müller cells and will evaluate ?1R interaction with members of the Nrf2-Keap1 pathway. Finally, we know that (+)-PTZ can rescue cone PRC in rd10 mice through post-natal day (P)42; however we do not know the extent to which (+)-PTZ treatment can delay cone death in rd10 mice beyond this age nor whether the effects are generalizable to other ?1R ligands. Aim 3 will test this by evaluating retinal function/structure in (+)-PTZ-treated rd10 mice over an extended time course and will assess efficacy of two other ?1R ligands. In summary, promising data form the basis of our proposal, which explores a novel mechanism by which ?1R activation mediates PRC rescue and investigates the extent to which the phenomenon is sustainable and generalizable to other ?1R ligands."
"9559779","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Given the improved efficacy of antiretroviral (ARV) therapy (ART), HIV-infected persons are living near-normal lifespans. Therefore, it is critical to understand the adverse consequences of long-term ART use. Our previous clinico-pathological study using samples from the National NeuroAIDS Tissue Consortium (NNTC) demonstrated direct association between protease inhibitor-based ART and higher risk of cerebral arteriolosclerosis. This has important clinical implication because mild arteriolosclerosis was found to associate with neurocognitive impairment even after adjusting for HIV encephalitis or older age. We hypothesize that ARV-associated arteriolosclerosis may be mediated by the acceleration of vascular cell senescence related to advanced glycation end products (AGEs) and receptor for AGEs (RAGE) signaling.  The early stages of small vessel degeneration are characterized by vascular cell degeneration and basement membrane thickening. We propose a set of novel approaches to 1) examine the relationship between ART and early-stage premature degeneration of small vessels in the brain (using NNTC samples), 2) identify small vessel degeneration biomarkers in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and 3) explore cellular mechanisms underlying small vessel degeneration using 3D co-cultures of human primary brain vascular cells.  In Aim 1, we will study the association of early-stage small vessel degeneration in the frontal white matter with ART. 1.1) We will measure immunoreactivity in uninterrupted small vessel segments for AGEs, RAGE, and markers of cell senescence, vascular cell types, and basement membranes in optically transparent 1,000-µm-thick brain sections, using a cutting-edge tissue clearing technique and fluorescence microscopy for 3D proteomic imaging and quantitative phenotyping. 1.2) We will assess vessel homogenates isolated from the adjacent brain tissue for transcript and protein expression of the same set of markers. In Aim 2, to identify CSF biomarkers of early-stage vascular degeneration, we will assay CSF samples for soluble forms of the protein markers examined in Aim 1. In Aim 3, we will explore in vitro the role of the AGEs-RAGE axis in ARV-induced vascular cell senescence. Vascular endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells, and pericytes will be co-cultured in 3D multi-layer scaffold systems (mimicking the in vivo small vessel wall). We will assess in cultured cells changes of AGEs, RAGE, cell senescence-associated markers, and cell type-specific proteins. In conditioned media (mimicking the CSF), soluble forms of the proteins will be measured. For ARV drugs showing cytotoxic effects, the intracellular AGEs-RAGE signaling pathways will be explored in vascular cell co-cultures.  This translational research is consistent with the research areas supported by the NINDS and included in the 2017 Overarching HIV/AIDS Research Priorities for AIDS Funding, specifically premature aging associated with long-term ART. In future studies, we plan to test the usefulness of the CSF biomarkers in living patients on long-term ART who are at risk for cerebral small vessel disease and neurocognitive impairment."
"9524668","The ultimate goal of this Fast Track small business research project is to improve the vision of people who have abnormal corneal conditions that substantially alter the corneal shape such as keratoconus and corneal transplant. Patients with abnormal corneal shapes have substantially larger magnitudes of both lower-order and higher-order aberrations compared to normals. Even with optimal sphero-cylindrical correction, the uncorrected residual higher order aberrations cause a clinically significant degradation in visual quality. Correcting the higher order aberrations has been challenging due to both the inability to measure highly aberrated eyes and to manufacture a contact lens with an irregular (non-rotationally symmetrical) surface profile. This research project is designed to address these current barriers by developing a commercial grade, large dynamic range wavefront sensor, together with freeform machining technology to fabricate wavefrontguided customized soft contact lenses. In Phase 1, we will demonstrate the feasibility of freeform machining technology to create an irregular (non-rotationally symmetrical) lens surface profile capable of correcting higher order aberrations (Phase 1 Aim 1) and minimizing unpredictable translation and rotation of the lens on eye by customizing the back surface of the lens matched to the irregular anterior surface of the cornea (Phase 1 Aim 2). In Phase 2, Aim 1, we will develop a commercial-grade large dynamic range wavefront sensor equipped with user-friendly software for wavefront analysis and contact lens design. In Phase 2, Aim 2, we will evaluate methods to maximize the visual benefit with the wavefront-guided lens by minimizing the adverse impact of residual lens movement on correction performance. Then, in Phase 2, Aim 3, we will compare the visual outcomes with this customized soft contact lens (CustomEyes) to those with soft contact lenses designed to fit keratoconic eyes but with conventional sphero-cylindrical optics to determine the clinical feasibility and the true visual benefit provided by the wavefront guided customized soft lens in keratoconus patients."
"9357393","PROJECT 1: Pathways and mechanisms repressing D4Z4 repeats Abstract FSHD is caused by derepression of the DUX4 retrogene in skeletal muscle, either by contraction induced chromatin relaxation of the D4Z4 repeat array (FSHD1), or by mutations in the chromatin modifier SMCHD1 or yet unidentified chromatin modifiers (FSHD2). These facts lead to the major hypothesis that FSHD is caused by incomplete repeat-mediated epigenetic silencing of DUX4 in somatic cells and that targeting the D4Z4 chromatin structure is a rational therapy for FSHD. Therefore, the broad and long term goal is to identify the components and mechanisms of repeat-mediated epigenetic silencing at D4Z4 and to determine whether they function in convergent pathways that can be used to develop therapies that enhance epigenetic repression of D4Z4. The specific goal is to identify modulators of D4Z4 chromatin structure and DUX4 expression by a genetics approach. This will be accomplished by: Aim 1 identify additional DNMT3B mutations that cause FSHD2 and test the hypothesis that DNMT3B mutations with distinct clinical phenotypes have distinct epigenetic consequences at the D4Z4 repeat; Aim 2 identify novel genetic variants in chromatin modifiers that affect the D4Z4 chromatin structure in somatic cells and cause FSHD or act as a disease modifier; and Aim 3, establish the genome wide epigenetic and transcriptional consequences of mutations in FSHD2 genes and to identify enhancers repeat-mediated epigenetic silencing at D4Z4 as novel targets for therapy. Together, these aims will identify additional modifiers of D4Z4 repression and their epigenetic activity, and establish which modifiers of D4Z4 chromatin structure can be targeted for FSHD therapy. The significance of these studies is that identifying the components and mechanisms of repeat-mediated epigenetic silencing of DUX4 will facilitate the development of new drug therapies in FSHD"

Our research plan focuses on better understanding health trends and disparities, the determinants of health, and the effective use of health care resources to improve outcomes for an aging population in an evolving landscape. Project 1 (Case and Deaton) explores variations in health trends across geography, race and ethnicity, education, and cohort, identifying and analyzing the life circumstances of those whose health and wellbeing have worsened. Project 2 (Maestas) focuses on the increasing prevalence of pain and opioid use, and their relationship to health outcomes, work, and disability program enrollment. Project 3 (Duflo) analyzes the rapid rise in chronic disease in aging, poorer populations (focusing on India), and the potential role of public policy interventions in improving health in a global context. Project 4 (Baicker and Obermeyer) applies machine learning tools to administrative data to identify overuse (reflecting care with little health benefit relative to its cost or risks) and underuse (reflecting missed opportunities for health benefits) of medical services, focusing on the case of diagnostic testing. Project 5 (Kolstad and Handel) analyzes the impact of information technology in physician treatment decisions, and the potential health benefits of expanded use of IT in health care. Project 6 (Chandra and Sacarny) looks at how information about provider quality affects patients' decisions about their medical care, and whether information on quality improves health care market performance through competition. Project 7 (Baicker and Finkelstein) looks at the effect of public health insurance on health care and outcomes for poor adults, using a randomized controlled design enabled by Oregon's health insurance lottery. Project 8 (Williams) looks at policies that stimulate or impede research and innovation in medicine, and the degree to which the ?new uses? problem results in underinvestment in innovations with a potentially positive social value. The program project leverages synergies in methods, data sources, and health issues addressed, building on common themes of health trends and disparities, the role of information for patients and providers, and the potential for different policies to improve health. This research has particular importance in the context of societal changes in demographics, population health, health policy, health care organization, and medicine. The program project will also continue to serve as the organizational foundation for a much larger community of scholars engaged in health-related research at the NBER, attracting some of the most talented scientists from each new generation of economists to the study of health issues. Linking this community to health researchers in other disciplines, particularly in medical and clinical fields, is an important new aim of the program, fostering the cross-disciplinary approaches needed to tackle the most pressing health issues facing an aging population."
"9317284","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Improper food handling practices in the food service setting are important risk factors for foodborne illness. New Yorkers eat out nearly one billion times each year, and two-thirds eat meals from a restaurant, deli, coffee shop or bar at least once per week, so the potential public health impact of unsafe food handling practices in New York City (NYC) restaurants is enormous.  NYC is home to over 24,000 restaurants and 5000 mobile vendors. The NYC Department of Health & Mental Hygiene is responsible for permitting and inspecting these entities for compliance with food safety and hygiene rules. With support from CDC EHS-Net, we will develop and evaluate a series of food safety interventions to be distributed to the NYC food service industry. We will use data collected during routine inspections to inform content of interventions and assist in targeting the poorest performing restaurants. We will integrate a systematic collection of environmental assessment data into our foodborne outbreak investigation protocol to better understand the environmental factors associated with foodborne illness. These data will be reported to the National Voluntary Environmental Assessment Information System to support national surveillance initiatives. We will also participate in multisite food safety studies proposed by CDC EHS-Net.  We will promote food safety in NYC restaurants and mobile food vending settings using three types of interventions: 1) restaurant operator and food worker education, 2) enhanced training of Health Department inspectors who educate operators during inspections, and 3) regulations and policies. We will evaluate the effectiveness of the food safety promotion tools in use in NYC to inform restaurant and mobile vending food safety programs both in NYC and nationally."

"9384413","Project Summary  The central nervous system (CNS), the most complex and dynamic network found in nature, is composed of billions of neurons with trillions of dendritic spines and synapses, including pre- and postsynaptic terminals. The postsynaptic side of synapses can take the form of dendritic spines, which are small, actin-rich protrusions that serve as sites of postsynaptic contact and signal integration for most of the excitatory synapses in the CNS. Synapses relay signals between neighboring neurons in large neuronal networks, underscoring their vital function in the CNS. Not surprisingly, abnormalities in dendritic spines/synapses are associated with a number of CNS disorders, including Fragile-X syndrome, Down?s syndrome, Alzheimer?s disease, autism, schizophrenia, and epilepsy, glaucoma, and intellectual disorders. It is, therefore, crucial to understand the relationships between the functional connectivity map of neuronal networks and the physiological or pathological functions of individual synapses and neurons. To address this challenge, we propose to integrate two-dimensional flexible graphene membranes with scanning photocurrent microscopy to probe electrical activities of individual synapses and neurons in the retina and brain, two of the three components of the CNS. A unique advantage of graphene is that its whole volume is exposed to the environment, which maximizes its sensitivity to local electrochemical potential change. For example, graphene transistors are capable of detecting individual gas molecules, due to its high surface-area-to-volume ratio and high electron mobility (100 to 1000 times higher than silicon). The high electron mobility also enables graphene transistors to operate at very high frequencies (up to 500 GHz), leading to high temporal resolution. Because of its strength and flexibility, graphene membranes can adhere to cell membranes or tissue slices to achieve high electrical sensitivity. Furthermore, monolayer graphene transmits more than 97% of incident light, making it ideal to be used as transparent electrical devices that are compatible with optical imaging techniques. In addition, graphene transistors and electrodes have demonstrated the capability of stable operation at stretching up to 9%. As such, we propose to create an unprecedented neurotechnology through a rare combination of flexible graphene transistors and scanning photocurrent microscopy to simultaneously study the electrical activities of a large population of synapses and neurons in vitro, in situ, and in vivo. This technology will allow us to decipher the functional connectivity map of neuronal networks with high spatiotemporal resolution and high throughput."
"9551132","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Falls are very common and extremely dangerous events for the elderly, constituting the leading cause of injury and incurring costs likely to exceed $68 Billion by 2020. Falls cause more than 95% of hip fractures and lateral falls (to the side) in particular contribute to 76% of all hip fractures. Most falls occur while walking and humans are inherently more unstable laterally when walking. Also, very limited scientific evidence exists to guide de- sign of interventions to improve walking function in the elderly. Thus, there is a clear need to identify the control strategies elderly use to maintain lateral balance while walking and to develop effective, evidence-based treatment strategies to improve lateral balance control in high fall risk elderly to reduce their risk of falls.  The primary goal f this study is to develop interventions to help prevent falls. This requires intervening before fall occur. As people age, multiple physiological changes increase intrinsic physiological (neuromuscular) noise and decrease control authority (the ability to effectively regulate movements). Either or both of these can increase walking variability, which may contribute to falls. However, not all variability is detrimental. Increasing variability can sometimes even facilitate adaptability and improve recovery in locomotor rehabilitation. We recently developed novel computational control theory models that separate physiological noise from control authority to identify how walking humans exploit redundancy to regulate variability in the sagittal plane. We have now extended this work to determine how humans control lateral stepping movements in the frontal plane.  Real-world walking tasks require humans both to be able to respond to changing task goals and also to choose effective strategies. Here, Aim 1 will determine how elderly with Low Fall Risk or High Fall Risk respond to externally imposed challenges (enforced step width and/or lateral perturbations). We will integrate our theoretical framework with computational models and experiments to differentiate effects of control from those of variability. Separately, Aim 2 will determine how elderly make (cognitive) internal choices to either avoid risk or fortify themselves against potential risk. We will again integrate experiments, models, and analyses to identify how Low and High Fall Risk elderly choose different risk-sensitive strategies. Aim 3 will determine if a targeted virtual reality based intervention that challenges people to both respond to imposed changes in lateral position, and also to choose effective strategies for doing so, can improve lateral stepping control and walking balance in High Fall Risk elderly. In a randomized, active control treatment trial, we will compare pre- and post-intervention changes in walking ability both with and without lateral perturbations, performance in a novel real-world-like navigation task, and established clinical assessments of walking and balance function. This study will apply novel experimental and rigorous computational and analytical approaches to greatly improve our understanding of how elderly individuals walk. We will translate this knowledge into clinical practice by implementing novel VR-based interventions that promise to improve walking function in high fall risk elderly."
"9420368","Project Summary  A complete understanding of both normal brain function and neurological disorders / mental illness will require the deciphering of the complex brain networks that underlie behavior and cognition, at both whole-brain and microscopic scales. The difficulty of structurally and functionally mapping these brain networks in living human subjects with sufficient sensitivity and resolution to understand normal function and detect pathological change represents a fundamental challenge. Recognizing these challenges, the NIH and other funding agencies have supported new initiatives in brain mapping for decades, starting with the Decade of the Brain, followed by the Decade after the Decade of the Brain, the New Century of the Brain, the Human Connectome Project, and most recently the BRAIN Initiative. Most of these brain mapping initiatives have featured MRI, the premier tool for studying the intact living human brain, non-invasively, at high resolution, and with high sensitivity to many subtle physiological and pathological processes. For example, the NIH-funded Human Connectome Project (HCP) was launched in 2009 to comprehensively map brain circuitry in 1,200 healthy subjects using MRI, and has already had a large impact on the neuroscience field. The HCP uses diffusion MRI (dMRI) and BOLD-based functional MRI (fMRI) to derive whole-brain structural and functional connectivity maps for individual subjects at 1.25-2mm resolution (2-8µL voxels). Such coarse resolution results in the spatial blurring of single-voxel responses over 105-106 neurons. The NIH BRAIN Initiative calls for disruptive new approaches to resolving brain circuit connections and function at dramatically higher spatiotemporal and microstructure resolution. This 2-year proof-of-concept BRAIN R01 will focus on producing a complete and validated design for a next-generation, compact, low-cost, high-performance ultra-high-field (UHF) MRI system, capable of resolving neural connections and circuitry at the scale of 104 neurons (~0.2µL), throughout the entire living human brain non-invasively. This would address a specific target identified in BRAIN 2025, which calls for significant developments in MR methodology targeting whole brain studies with voxel volumes of 0.3-0.4µL in the short term, and 0.1µL or better in the long term. Our specific goals in this project are to re- engineer all front-end hardware components of the UHF MRI system, thereby resolving the technological and physics challenges that have been severely holding back this human brain imaging modality. We will develop several disruptive technologies, designed synergistically to create a dramatically lower cost but higher performing UHF MRI system: 1) ultra-compact UHF magnet technology; 2) ultra-high-performance gradient hardware; and 3) innovative shim and RF array technologies designed to fully correct both main field and RF inhomogeneity problems. The practical impact of our work will be to enable greatly improved human brain mapping using dMRI and fMRI, while simultaneously solving the major technological and cost limitations of UHF MRI."
"9371340","Project Summary/Abstract T-cell lymphomas display shorter relapse intervals and poor overall survival. Targeted therapies for T-cell lymphomas are lacking, and there is no established standard of care for patients at relapse. The limited information on the specific molecular signals that are activated in T-cell lymphomas hampers the development of effective therapies. Emergent research has demonstrated that aberrant activation of proteins involved in actin organization is critical for cancer metastasis and tumor growth. The candidate preliminary studies demonstrate that a large network of actin organizing proteins is activated during the development of T-cell lymphoma. Also, the major actin regulatory protein Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (WASp) increases the dissemination and growth of a subtype of T-cell lymphoma, anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL). These preliminary findings are very exciting, as identified a major actin regulatory protein as key determinant for lymphoma development. However, whether WASp also plays a role in lymphoma development in more common and aggressive types of T-cell lymphomas needs to be determined. The candidate novel preliminary findings demonstrate that WASp is expressed and activated in the most common type of T-cell lymphoma in the United States, peripheral T- cell lymphoma, non-otherwise specified (PTCL-NOS). In addition, WASp expression decreases the sensitivity of primary T-cell lymphoma cells to available chemotherapeutics, suggesting a role of WASp in chemotherapy resistance. Moreover, WASp can activate downstream proteins known to increase tumor proliferation and dissemination. Among these proteins, activation of lymphocyte specific protein 1 (LSP1) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) in T-cell lymphomas has been validated. Importantly, ERK pathway can be inhibited with drugs that are currently in clinical trials for other types of cancer. The central hypothesis is that WASp and its downstream signals (ERK and LSP1) are therapeutic targets for patients with a diagnosis of T-cell lymphoma. In this proposal, I will evaluate 1) the role of WASp and its downstream signals (ERK and LSP1) during lymphoma growth, 2) the role of WASp dependent actin re-organization during T-cell lymphoma dissemination, 3) the signaling pathways that mediate WASp-dependent chemotherapy resistance, and 4) the oncogenic role of WASp in-vivo using a mice model of T-cell lymphoma with knock-down expression of WASp. The candidate long term career goal is to develop as a successful independent physician-scientist with a research focus in the pathobiology of T-cell lymphomas. The candidate career development plan is structured in three main components to help achieve its goals; 1) Gain technical and clinical skills for translational studies on T-cell lymphomas, 2) Expand its knowledge related to tumor progression and 3) Develop skills to become an independent scientist and write an R01 application to the NCI."
"9454644","SUMMARY  The goal of this project is to develop novel and computationally efficient methods for analyzing bivariate alternating recurrent event data such as hospitalization data. Patients who have recurrent conditions such as psychiatric disorders or received major medical procedures such as transplant can be repeatedly admitted to hospitals. Hospitalization data usually include both admission and discharge time, which leads to an alternating sequence of in hospital stay and out of hospital periods. The two types of time periods each carry important and likely distinct information about the underlying health condition of the patients and the quality of care. Therefore, it is of interest to develop proper statistical methods that can fully utilize the rich information in hospitalization data. To our knowledge, there has been a lack of efficient statistical methods and software for analyzing such data. One can apply single-type recurrent event methods on the admission-time-only data by ignoring the discharge times. However, by using these methods one cannot distinguish whether a covariate's effect is on the length of hospital stay or the out of hospital periods, or both. For example, a new treatment that shortens in hospital stays and at the same time prolongs the out of hospital time could be deemed ineffective if it is evaluated based solely on the length between hospital admissions. In literature, there exists a nonparametric method for estimating the joint distribution of the two types of periods. However, in applications, regression methods would be more attractive. An accelerated failure time model has been proposed, but its estimation is based on a non-smooth rank-based estimating equation and its variance estimation is based on a computationally intensive resampling method. Therefore, this method has not been widely applied.  In Specific Aim 1, we propose to develop a regression method which is based on a set of smooth estimating equations that are continuous and differentiable. Hence, the proposed method is expected to be more computationally stable and efficient than the existing rank-based method. In Specific Aim 2, we propose to extend an efficient resampling method for general non-smooth estimation functions to the rank-based model for more computationally efficient variance estimates. We will conduct simulation studies under various carefully designed scenarios to compare the proposed methods and existing methods. The proposed methods will also be applied to two hospitalization data, one with patients diagnosed with schizophrenia during 1981- 1995 in South Verona, Italy, and the other with adult patients (20% experiencing depression or anxiety pre- transplant) who underwent blood and marrow transplanted at the University of Minnesota during 2010-2015. An R package will be developed and made available to the public. This proposed research holds the potential to provide caregivers and policy makers the much-needed information on factors related to patients' different patterns of utilizations of health care facilities so that they can target their efforts to the populations who need improvement in their healthcare quality the most."
"9473492","PROJECT SUMMARY There is a current lack of understanding of differential gene expression within the nervous system. Ideally one would like to know, across all neuron types, exactly how the genome is transcribed and processed into functional RNAs. This information is fundamentally important because differential gene expression defines the form and function of individual neurons, determines how individual neurons contribute to circuit physiology and behavior, and influences how individual neurons are affected by injury and disease. Further, detailed and complete knowledge of differential gene expression within the nervous system would help elucidate the logic and cellular mechanisms that generate neuronal diversity, including regulation of gene expression, alternative splicing, and miRNA function. Yet progress in this area has been limited: For most nervous systems, the exact number of distinct types of neurons is unknown and therefore a global map of neuron-specific gene expression is not achievable. Here we propose to address this problem in a project to discover and analyze the C. elegans Neuronal Gene Expression Map & Network (CeNGEN). The C. elegans nervous system contains precisely 302 total neurons comprising 118 classes of distinct neuronal types. We propose to exploit this unique attribute to analyze gene expression with high accuracy in every individual neuronal type. CeNGEN proceeds in four specific aims. Aim 1) Establish 118 transgenic strains, each one expressing fluorescent markers that uniquely label a single type of neuron. Aim 2) Use innovative cell dissociation and FACS methods to isolate each type of neuron from age-matched adults, and use RNA-seq approaches to assess global coding transcript and miRNA expression, as well as splicing diversity. Aim 3) Utilize single cell sequencing technology to precisely map gene expression over multiple parameter spaces. Aim 4) Build cell-centered and gene-centered expression maps, and seek connections with other uniquely known features of the C. elegans nervous system including the wiring diagram, the cell lineage, neurotransmitter identity, and function. CeNGEN represents a paradigmatic advance in neurogenetics, and provides a unique opportunity to elucidate the global control of neuron-specific gene expression and to relate gene expression to neuronal wiring and function. Expected significant outcomes include: Identification of conserved regulatory mechanisms that generate neuronal specificity and diversity; Detailed understanding of alternative splicing and miRNA function across the nervous system; Relationship of differential gene expression to neuronal lineage, anatomy, function and connectivity. CeNGEN will also serve as a resource for future studies in C. elegans neuroscience, and will provide a framework for addressing global differential gene expression in more complex nervous systems that are currently not amenable to this comprehensive approach."
"9464729","Project Summary/Abstract  Interneurons are a ubiquitous part of nearly every brain region that has been studied. They play a diverse and important set of functions, yet there is a gap between our understanding of these functions and their implementation at the level of cellular and circuit mechanisms. The antennal lobe is the first brain region in the Drosophila olfactory system, and has proven to be a valuable circuit for understanding the gap between neural computations and their implementation on a cellular and circuit level. The overarching goal of this proposal is to investigate how circuit mechanisms give rise to specific functions of inhibition ? such as gain control and temporal filtering. The specific hypothesis of this proposal is that antennal lobe local neurons (LNs) with different physiological properties connect to distinct synaptic targets and perform qualitatively different network functions. Alternatively, different LNs may have essentially the same network function, just in slightly different regimes (e.g., acting on fast versus slow timescales), or else functions of inhibition may be emergent properties of the entire LN cohort. The proposed approach will consider all three alternatives, any of which would be of interest to the field.  Aim 1 will establish correlations between LN odor response physiology (e.g., ON/OFF, fast/slow, concentration variant/invariant) and LN synaptic connectivity. In vivo whole-cell recordings will be performed to determine which physiological LN types map onto which morphological LN types. The use of existing serial section electron microscopy data (ssEM) will then aid in mapping physiological LN types directly onto synaptic connectivity profiles, by using morphological LN types as the link. The synthesis of these two data sets will determine how different physiological LN types connect to different targets. Aim 2 will investigate how the antennal lobe network is affected by activating/silencing different LN types. In Aim 2a in vivo current-clamp recordings will be performed from antennal lobe output projection neurons (PNs) and LNs while presenting odor stimuli, both with and without optogenetic activation/inactivation of specific LN types. The following metrics will be used to determine how boosting/suppressing the activity of specific LN types alter: (1) the ability of PNs to maintain concentration invariant odor representations (gain control), (2) the ability of PNs to transmit odor information over a wide range of timescales (temporal filtering), and (3) the properties of odor- evoked oscillations. In Aim 2b a simple firing rate model of the antennal lobe will be constructed with connection weights taken from existing ssEM reconstructions. Similar activation/inactivation experiments will then be performed on model LNs, and PN performance will be assessed using the same three metrics described above. The combination of these methods uniquely positions this project to develop a clear conceptual framework for understanding how specific interneuron types interact in a network. The behavior of interneuron networks is a topical problem with broad relevance, and this study will have significance for a wide community of neurobiologists. Moreover, understanding how interneurons function in a network will be critical for determining how to treat psychiatric disorders that are linked to interneuron dysfunction, such as schizophrenia, autism spectrum disorders, and epilepsy."
"9480016","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Strategies for treating degenerative retinal diseases are evolving at a rapid pace; however there exist major gaps impeding progress towards the ultimate audacious goal of regenerating neurons in the eye to restore sight. Technologies for monitoring the presence and health of individual photoreceptors and ganglion cells in living animal and human retinae are desperately needed. These tools would provide critical insight into the pathogenesis of a number of retinal and neuro-degenerative diseases; such insight is a requisite first step to developing the appropriate therapeutic approaches for a given patient/disease. Furthermore, improved visualization of cellular structure and function in patients with retinal degenerative diseases will permit scientists and clinicians to more precisely target and monitor the outcome of their therapeutic interventions. We have assembled a multidisciplinary research team uniquely equipped to address this major technological need. Drawing on our extensive experience in developing adaptive optics and retinal imaging tools, we propose to develop and disseminate four complementary platform/enabling technologies. We will leverage our existing collaborative relationships among all five participating sites, synergisic expertise, and access to extensive animal models along with an unrivaled patient population for testing these technologies. The specific technologies we propose to develop are: 1) Real-time retinal motion compensation, allowing retinal cellular-resolution imaging even in cases of extreme involuntary eye motion, like nystagmus; 2) Adaptive longitudinal chromatic aberration correction, allowing multi-wavelength, cellular-resolution retinal imaging; 3) Super- resolution line scanning ophthalmoscopy, to non-invasively image previously inaccessible cells and provide the largest image resolution improvement (> 50%) since the original demonstration of ophthalmic adaptive optics; and 4) High-throughput, opto-physiological method for assessing photoreceptor function with cellular resolution, providing a sensitive biomarker for assessing the function of regenerated/restored cells. A major strength of this application is that through our collaborative network we will validate the utility of these new technologies using regenerative therapies in both pre-clinical and clinical settings. This work will have a significant positive impact by enabling diagnosis of retinal disease and monitoring of retinal structure and function with unprecedented sensitivity and resolution. Finally, the focus of the proposed technologies will be photoreceptor and retinal ganglion cell imaging to explicitly advance the audacious goal, but they will not be limited to assessing any one therapeutic approach or cell type. Rather they will be generalizable and broadly applicable to all retinal cell types, retinal diseases, and therapeutic strategies."
"9386306","Project Summary/Abstract.  Life on Earth evolved to take time cues from the Sun. Consequently, most or all cells in the mammalian body use genetic feedback loops to time their daily (circadian) rhythms. When a person or any mammal sees light, that winds an orchestrating circadian brain clock in the hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN). The SCN in turn helps keep the myriad other tissue and endocrine rhythms in synchrony, enabling health. The modern environment is highly disruptive to this internal synchrony. Light at night from cell phones or urban light pollution, and social impositions like school start times or rotating work shifts all act as ?temporal pollution,? causing loss of internal synchrony. The more severe the desynchrony, the higher the risk for a broad range of diseases, including obesity, cancer, infertility, depression and ultimately cognitive decline. Without knowing how these systems normally maintain synchrony or which systems are normally synchronized, it is hard to understand what happens in desynchrony to degrade health. This problem is complicated by the fact that some biological systems have ultradian (every few hours) and infradian (every few days) cycles in addition to circadian cycles. The hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA) generates ultradian rhythms through negative feedback, but also shows a strong circadian cycle; the hypothalamo-pituitary-gonadal axis (HPG) shows the same negative feedback ultradian activity, circadian rhythmicity, and also infradian rhythms of ovulation and spermatogenesis. These two axes are regulated by the SCN. Recent work indicates that there is cross-talk between these axes, and that their hormonal outputs - corticosterone, and estradiol (in females) and testosterone (in males), respectively ? work to synchronize extra-SCN tissues and behavioral rhythms of feeding and drinking (FaD). Finally, the SCN, HPA, and HPG axes all affect core body temperature (CBT), so that high temporal resolution recordings of CBT contain information about the cycling and synchrony of these systems across time scales.  There are three aims to this proposal, using rats as a model system: 1) Test at high temporal resolution the effects of changes to the HPA axis, HPG axis, and SCN on CBT. 2) Use these relationships to build a model that can back-predict the state of the HPA axis, HPG axis, and SCN from a high temporal resolution CBT record of a given individual. 3) Expose rats to environmental temporal disruption in the form of a 6 h ?jetlag? phase advance of the light cycle, and use the model to predict the response across these systems at 1-minute temporal resolution. This work will employ within-animal comparisons before and after surgical and pharmacological manipulations of rats whose FaD, activity, and CBT are captured continuously at 1-minute resolution. These data will be analyzed using signal-processing and machine learning to define patterns and relationships. The resulting model will allow minimally-invasive exploration of environmental disruption across physiological systems in real time. The model will be used to quantify synchrony as it is disrupted and re-emerges, identifying markers for risk or resilience, and generating hypotheses for future work into preventive strategies and treatments."
"9350565","Peripheral nerves are well-organized composite tissues that exist in a dynamic biomechanical environment created by the movement of articulating joints. To accommodate mechanical loads, nerves glide and stretch within their beds. Nerve entrapment alters the structure of nerves, restricts their ability to glide, and excessively increases regional deformation, ultimately impairing sensory and motor function. The most common entrapment neuropathy among Veterans is carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS), a disease in which the median nerve is impinged at the wrist, within the carpal tunnel. Surgical treatment of carpal tunnel syndrome is generally effective, but revision may be required for 3-20% of surgeries. Given the prevalence of CTS, this corresponds to a substantial number of patients. Electrodiagnostics are considered to be the gold standard for CTS diagnosis, inconclusive outcomes are not uncommon, especially in the presence of other overlying neuropathies, such as diabetic neuropathy.  Despite their likely influence on neuropathic progression, nerve structural and biomechanical changes have been used only minimally to diagnose or track neuropathy, or to assess the efficacy of surgical management. This is in large part due to the challenges associated with imaging nerves using current techniques. Our research team has developed new magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and ultrasound-based imaging methods that allow the visualization of nerves at high spatial resolution on contrast. These capabilities allow accurate measurement of nerve biomechanics (deformation and stiffness), and also identification and quantitative characterization of structural elements within nerves. These methods are expected to provide a powerful and sensitive approach to non-invasively assess neuropathy and surgical efficacy.  Given its prevalence, CTS provides an ideal test-bed for translating our nerve imaging and image processing techniques to a clinical setting. In particular, we propose to use ultrasound and MRI techniques to evaluate structure and biomechanics of median nerves in patients requiring surgery for CTS. Our proposal uses a multi-disciplinary approach to address two specific aims. Our first aim is to optimize MRI-based and ultrasound imaging methodology in median nerves. We will use human cadaveric and in vivo models to validate and optimize imaging protocols that will be used clinically. We expect that MRI-based strategies will provide high resolution and high contrast structural images of nerves, while ultrasound will provide rapid assessment of nerve kinematics and stiffness. Our second aim is to examine structural and kinematic changes of median nerves in patients with CTS, before and after carpal tunnel release, using MRI and ultrasound. We hypothesize that MRI-based imaging will detect structural differences in epineurial, perineurial, and nerve fiber compartments between control and entrapped nerves, and ultrasound will detect differences in nerve deformation and stiffness among control nerves and entrapped nerves before and after surgery.  More broadly, we anticipate applying our approach to other neurological conditions that impact the Veteran healthcare system, in which nerve structure and biomechanics may be altered. These include other entrapment neuropathies, diabetic neuropathy, and traumatic nerve injury. Ultimately, successful execution of our proposed study will enable earlier recognition of neuropathy, provide noninvasive monitoring of neuropathic progression, and facilitate more accurate assessment of rehabilitative and therapeutic efficacy. 1"

In 2013 NaRCAD initiated an AHRQ-supported annual conference series to allow the sharing of knowledge and help guide and improve the field within the evolving health care landscape . We propose to improve and expand this conference series with annual meetings from 2016 through 2018 to focus on enhancing the impact of academic detailing on health care improvement initiatives. In hosting these conferences we will continue to provide a forum for the community of professionals working on academic detailing and clinical outreach education to the US health care community. The annual sessions showcase best practices in academic detailing and raise the visibility of the role of academic detailing in quality improvement. The conference series also sustain and expand NaRCAD's network of academic detailing programs, allowing for further The conferences feature a mix of formal plenary presentations from leaders in the field with discussion and breakout sessions that provide ample time for interaction; both session types will address the current state of knowledge, share best practices and identify emerging issues in the field. Organizations and individuals will be able to submit their work for presentation at the conference sessions. growth of this important approach.  The conferences will be valuable for a wide variety of stakeholders who will participate, including public and private organizations using academic detailing, Medicaid agencies, policymakers, public health agencies, academics, insurers, non-profits interested in health care improvement and consumers. The conference proceedings will serve as educational materials for the greater academic detailing community in the US. Materials from the conference, as well as professionally prepared video presentations, will be freely available online in our Resource & Learning Center after the conference, serving as long-standing resources as well as promotional items. As the only established meeting of both national and international academic detailing organizations, our continued conference series helps strengthen academic detailing practice and improve healthcare quality. Ultimately, the sharing, deliberations and lessons from these meetings lead to practice changes for academic detailing worldwide and improve the readiness of the healthcare system to enact change."
"9433481","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Sports-related concussion in youth is increasingly being recognized as a public health concern. Decreasing the health burden of concussion requires both (a) decreasing the number of concussions that occur by decreasing dangerous collisions (primary prevention) and (b) ensuring that youth are not playing with concussive symptoms and thereby incurring greater risk (secondary prevention). Rules are a promising means for effecting such changes (i.e, outlawing spearing, requiring that athletes be removed from play if a concussion is suspected), but changing rules is not effective if we do not also shift the culture of youth sport regarding safety. Sport cultures that reinforce values of winning-at-all-costs lead athletes, coaches and parents to disregard the rules that are intended to keep athletes safe. Referees, many of whom are often minors themselves, face challenges enforcing rules in such environments. Changing the culture of sport requires a paradigm shift in how we think about intervention. Prior efforts to decrease the incidence of concussion and decrease the rate of youth playing with concussive symptoms have had limited effectiveness because they did not intervene at a systems-level. Changing sport culture requires intervening with multiple stakeholders (referees, coaches, athletes, parents) and addressing the values that underlie a commitment to following rules related to concussion safety. We propose an intervention called ?One Team? that will utilize safety huddles to shift the culture of youth sport. The huddle was originally developed in football, but it has been adopted by the medical system as a way to engage key stakeholders to improve safety. The One Team intervention will use pre-game safety huddles to bring together coaches, athletes, parents and referees to affirm: (a) values of sportsmanship (i.e, not engaging in dangerous and illegal collisions) and (b) shared responsibility that no athlete play while concussed. Working in partnership with football and soccer coaches, athletes, parents and referees in Seattle WA and Statesboro GA using a community-engaged process, we will refine the One Team intervention and conduct pilot evaluations of implementation and efficacy. We will also work with our national partners (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, US Soccer and USA Football) throughout this research to ensure that the product we develop will align with their organizational needs, dissemination platforms and channels. At the completion of this research we will have an intervention that will shift the culture of safety in youth sport and that can reach all youth sport stakeholders, including those in low resource communities."
"9481430","ABSTRACT The global AIDS epidemic is one of the greatest threats to human health and development. Countries need to ground their AIDS strategies in an understanding of their own epidemics and their national re- sponses. A reliable estimation and prediction on the HIV/AIDS epidemic can help policy makers and program planners ef?ciently allocate the resource, plan and manage the intervention, treatment and care programs, evaluate their effort, and raise funds.  The epidemiological model called ?EPP? has been used by the UNAIDS and most countries in the world for estimation and short-term prediction of HIV/AIDS trends from limited surveillance data since 2001. As the epidemic enters its fourth decade, both the epidemic and monitoring data sources have changed signi?cantly. The existing models are no longer capable of capturing the epidemic trend accu- rately. In this proposal, we plan to develop new statistical models to estimate and project the epidemic that re?ect those changes and utilize new data sources, with the following aims. 1. Incorporate new sources of data in current mathematical models to strengthen the epidemic esti-  mates for high HIV prevalence countries (known as generalized epidemic). 2. Develop hierarchical models to provide reliable estimates of HIV epidemics for sub-national areas  and key populations who are at higher risk for HIV, based on sexual practices, occupations, and  substance use. 3. Develop Bayesian models to improve the estimation of key population sizes. 4. We will produce freely-available, open-source software to implement all of the proposed models and methods."
"9422517","Overall Project Summary: Aging-associated cognitive decline, whether mild or severe, can profoundly affect the independence, well-being, and quality of life of those aged 65 and older. Development of effective interventions and treatments for this requires standard, psychometrically sound, easy-to-use measures that are sensitive to early indicators of cognitive decline and also capture non-cognitive factors associated with or predictive of cognitive changes. ?Advancing Reliable Measurement in Alzheimer's Disease and cognitive Aging? (ARMADA) proposes to meet this need by validating and expanding the NIH Toolbox for Assessment of Neurological and Behavioral Function® (NIHTB) for use in studies of cognitive aging beginning with normal cognition through progression into mild cognitive impairment and into early stages of Alzheimer's dementia. The NIHTB, developed with NIH support, provides a multidimensional, state-of-the-art set of measurement tools (available in English and Spanish) assessing key aspects of cognitive, sensory, motor, and emotional function and validated and normed in the general population for ages 3-85 years. To ensure that the NIHTB will be a valuable resource for cognitive aging research we will: 1) Validate English and Spanish versions of an expanded NIHTB (the NIHTB+) in existing, well-characterized, ethnically and racially diverse samples of adults ages 65-85 representing the trajectory of cognitive aging and in cognitively normal individuals 86+ years of age. 2) Expand the NIHTB by adding innovative instruments to assess neurological functions associated with cognitive aging; and 3) Facilitate use of the NIHTB+ in aging research by ensuring it is a readily available resource with robust user support. In order to accomplish these aims, we will form a consortium with the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center (NACC) and with researchers in cognitive aging and dementia from Alzheimer's Disease Centers and other clinical sites with existing cohorts. The consortium will be supported by Administrative, Technical, and Data and Statistical Analysis Cores."
"9421929","An Evaluation of State Laws Intended to Curb High-Risk Opioid Prescribing Opioid overdose deaths continue to increase in the U.S., with over 30,000 deaths in 2015. This epidemic is driven in large part by the high volume of opioids prescribed by healthcare providers. States have begun to enact laws designed to curb certain high-risk opioid prescribing practices, such as high-dose prescribing and overlapping opioid and benzodiazepine prescriptions, which are associated with misuse and mortality. Most recently, state efforts have centered on four types of laws. First, mandatory prescription drug monitoring program (PDMP) enrollment laws. While they exist in 49 states, only 35% of controlled substance prescribers report enrolling with PDMPs, or databases of controlled substance prescriptions that healthcare providers can access to learn about patients? past and current prescription drug use. To increase PDMP use, 20 states have enacted mandatory PDMP enrollment laws, which require prescribers to enroll in ? and thereby gain access to ? their state?s PDMP. Second, mandatory PDMP query laws, which require providers to check the PDMP prior to prescribing opioids, have been enacted in 20 states. Third, pill mill laws, which strictly regulate pain clinics to prevent rogue clinics from issuing opioid prescriptions without medical indication, have been enacted in 11 states. Fourth, opioid prescribing cap laws, which limit days? supply and/or dose of prescribed opioids, have been enacted in seven states. The effects of these laws on high-risk opioid prescribing are largely unknown.  Using qualitative interviews and Quintiles LifeLink LRx/Dx prescription and outpatient claims data we propose a mixed methods study of how these four types of laws independently affect high-risk opioid prescribing. We will focus on 18 ?treatment states? that enacted one of the four types of laws of interest ? but no other laws designed to curb high-risk opioid prescribing ? over a four-year period. We propose to: 1) explore the implementation and enforcement of the four types of laws in each of the 18 treatment states; 2) study the independent effects of these four types of state laws on high-risk opioid prescribing patterns; and 3) study the independent effects of the four types of laws on substitution of non-opioid pain treatments among individuals diagnosed with non-cancer chronic pain. For Aims 2 and 3 we will conduct synthetic control analyses comparing pre/post law trends in opioid prescribing in each treatment state to trends in a weighted combination of comparison states. A key strength of the proposed study is our ability to disentangle the causal effects of each of the four types of laws of interest on high-risk opioid prescribing. The mixed methods approach is another significant contribution: the results of our Aim 1 interviews will directly inform the design and interpretation of Aims 2 and 3. In the face of continuing increases in opioid overdose deaths and limited resources, state lawmakers need research evidence to inform decisions about policy enactment and implementation. The proposed study will fill critical gaps in knowledge regarding the effectiveness and implementation of state laws designed to curb high-risk opioid prescribing."
"9380871","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Circadian rhythms are the near-24-hour rhythms of physiology ubiquitous to almost all eukaryotic life. Dysfunction of circadian rhythms underlies a variety of common sleep disorders and is thought to contribute to other conditions ranging from psychiatric disease to cancer. The mammalian retina serves a critical function in synchronizing the master circadian pacemaker (the suprachiasmatic nucleus) to the daily light-dark cycle. Work over many years has also demonstrated that the retina itself is a strong circadian oscillator. Indeed, many critical retinal functions, including visual sensitivity, the pupillary light reflex, the electroretinogram, and the expression of hundreds of retinal genes, are under strong circadian control; and that loss of retinal circadian rhythms results in impaired retinal function. Our preliminary data have demonstrated that: 1) the retinal circadian clock can be entrained to light- dark cycles in culture ex vivo, 2) this entrainment is not dependent on the classical rods and cones or the melanopsin-expressing, intrinsically-photosensitive retinal ganglion cells, 3) the orphan opsin neuropsin (OPN5) is necessary for this photoentrainment, and the orphan opsin encephalopsin (OPN3) affects this process, 4) the retina utilizes a light-dependent, diffusible substance to synchronize its rhythms, and 5) the cornea also contains a circadian clock which, remarkably, can be entrained to light- dark cycles as well via an OPN5-dependent mechanism. We propose experiments to elucidate the signaling mechanisms of OPN5 and OPN3; experiments to characterize the diffusible signal(s) emanating from the retina, and experiments to elucidate the mechanism by which non-retinal tissues in the eye maintain circadian rhythmicity and entrain to light-dark cycles. These data will provide a critical basis for understanding how the circadian clock modulates retinal function as well as mechanistic insights into two novel ocular photoreceptors."
"9438672","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes are distinct clinical conditions with different etiologies, ages of onset, management strategies, risk factors, and outcomes. Currently, the data sources that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) relies upon to monitor trends in diabetes prevalence and incidence are unable to reliably distinguish between types of diabetes. Most of the large federal surveys used for diabetes surveillance have not included questions on diabetes type, and few studies have reported survey-based algorithms for identifying diabetes type. None have compared survey-based identification algorithms with a gold standard case ascertainment in order to validate survey-based assignment of diabetes type. Methods for distinguishing between diabetes types in electronic health records (EHR) data have been tested for children and adults, but additional validation work is needed. Our approach to improving diabetes surveillance in these two areas is based on an integrated study design whereby survey data for diabetes patients are linked with data from their EHR and a gold standard case ascertainment derived from chart review. We will select a diverse sample of diabetes patients that is designed and powered to assess algorithm validity for subpopulations defined by age, sex, and race/ethnicity. We will use rigorous questionnaire development methods to build on items used in previous surveys, cognitively test the new survey module to optimize wording and question order, field the survey using data collection methods similar to established CDC surveys, and analyze the responses relative to a gold standard classification of diabetes type. In addition, we will develop and validate against the gold standard EHR-based algorithms, including a modeling approach that produces a parsimonious rule-based algorithm for determining diabetes type based on the most important clinical variables, and a machine learning approach that uses the gold standard dataset as a starting point to identify implicit patterns that distinguish T1DM and T2DM."
"9387009","Project Summary ? Project 1 Recent public health emergencies, most notably the 2014-2016 Ebola epidemic, have exposed the vulnerabilities in West African health systems and the urgent need for improved global surveillance of infectious disease threats. ?Despite the burden of infectious disease in this region, the ?spectrum of circulating microbes, especially viruses, in West Africa is poorly understood. This owes, in part, to the lack of diagnostic capacity to detect known pathogens in many areas, and the nonspecific symptoms caused by many of these microbes, making it difficult to clinically determine the cause of infection. In this context, ?genomic approaches, including next-generation sequencing, have recently emerged as powerful tools for pathogen detection and discovery, as well as enabling valuable insight into the origins, transmission and biological properties of these pathogens. In this Project, we propose to use cutting edge next-generation sequencing capacity established at the three West African Collaborative Centers to identify known and novel viruses in patients with a fever and healthy controls. We will use computational approaches to assemble full viral genomes and understand the evolutionary dynamics and population genetics of the most important viral threats identified through metagenomic sequencing. Lastly, we will implement novel tools to enhance the efficiency and sensitivity of pathogen sequencing. This project will establish a framework for the sustainable application of powerful sequencing technologies in public health contexts and identify the most pressing viral threats in this region, informing the development of relevant diagnostic tests in Project 2. Furthermore, working across three West African countries, the sequencing efforts of our collaborative center will yield broad insights into the virome across a wide geographic region and allow for the sharing of approaches to enhance biosurveillance across West Africa. Not only will this continue to advance the genomics of infectious disease in West Africa, it will provide immediate, actionable insights to ?protect local communities and prevent future outbreaks. 1"
"9318134","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal is to continue the work of UNC's existing PRC (Center for Health Promotion and Disease Prevention - HPDP) but with a new focus on the link between community and health care efforts to prevent and control disease (CDC Domain 4), by developing and testing a technology-assisted community health worker implementation strategy for cardiovascular disease prevention with initial emphasis on low income, rural communities with large populations of underserved minorities. To support this effort and the broader work of the Center in its role to enhance public health practice through high quality research, HPDP will build new capacity in dissemination and implementation (D&I) research, adding faculty expertise in systems dynamic modeling and health services research. In addition, faculty with research and practice experience in health information technology and patient centered medical homes will join the team. The Center will collaborate with statewide stakeholders to disseminate EBIs and build public health practitioners' capacity to implement EBIs that target all levels of the socio-ecologic model. The center will build on community collaborations over the past 25 years to address the winnable battles -- nutrition, physical activity, obesity, and tobacco --that are most relevant to CVD prevention and treatment. Our efforts will be guided by NCCDPHP (CDC) strategic priorities (health equity, research translation, systems solutions, and sustainability) and the National Prevention Strategy (healthy community environments, quality preventive services, empowering personal health choices). Currently there is a widely recognized gap in coordination between primary care and public health. Community Health Workers have demonstrated the potential to significantly impact chronic disease risk factors, but coordinated programs between clinic and public health departments that collaborate with community health workers have not been adequately tested. The applied research project for this proposal, referred to as CHANGE (Carolina Heart Alliance Networking for Greater Equity) is designed to create and test new structures to leverage the complementary strengths of clinics and public health departments coordinated through technology-assisted community health workers, thereby expanding the reach and effectiveness of both clinical and community multi-level evidence-based interventions. The research design includes formative data collection to refine the CHANGE strategy; a pre-post comparison to assess implementation and effectiveness; a matched-control pre- post comparison to assess the CHANGE strategy's effects on the proportion of the clinic's total at-risk population that have cholesterol and blood pressure under control as compared to three matched comparison clinics; and finally planning for taking the CHANGE strategy to scale by replicating it in one additional community, identifying its core components, creating and disseminating a replication toolkit, and promoting the strategy's adoption through NC's multiple clinical, public health, and research networks."
"9572649","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Although genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified statistically significant associations of common genetic variants with a variety of complex diseases and risk factors, these common variants typically explain only 5-10% of the genetic contribution to the phenotypic variance. The residual genetic variance, the missing heritability, may have several sources and is in part attributed to rare variants. As a means of performing association studies in large populations, a panel of variants derived from the exome sequencing of over 12,000 subjects has been used to create an Illumina Infinium genotyping array, the ExomeChip, which features non-synonymous, non-sense, and splice-site coding-region rare or infrequent variants. The analytic challenges and the sample size requirements for the high-quality analysis of these rare coding-region variants will require novel organizational structures and collaborations. In the GWAS era, one of the most successful and productive collaborations has been the CHARGE Consortium, which facilitated prospectively planned GWAS meta-analyses of multiple phenotypes among large cohort studies. The original five CHARGE cohorts and four collaborating cohorts have jointly-called ExomeChip genotype data on more than 50,000 participants. While the cohorts have been able to reallocate funding (with Institute approval) to generate the rare variant data, there are no additional funds available in existing sources to address analytic issues, to coordinate efforts, or to implement the analysis of the ExomeChip data. The CHARGE collaboration, which takes advantage of the hundreds of millions of dollars invested in these cohort studies, represents a unique resource for genetic studies. The phenotype-specific Working Groups take the lead in choosing and harmonizing phenotypes. The CHARGE Analysis Committee members not only provide recommendations for analytic methods, but they also solve analytic problems, conduct cohort-specific analysis, and implement consortium- wide prospectively planned meta-analyses. In the GWAS era, these methods and this organizational structure enabled the CHARGE investigators to accelerate the discovery of genetic association for common variants. Using the available ExomeChip coding-region genotype data from 9 well-phenotyped cohorts, the primary aim is to discover novel candidate genes and putative functional variants for high-priority heart, lung and blood phenotypes in multi-ethnic cohorts. The main activities include the selection of high-priority phenotypes, the appraisal and dissemination of analytic methods, the conduct of rare-variant analyses within each cohort, the meta-analysis of cohort-specific findings, both within and between ethnic groups, analysis of family data, pathway analyses, efforts to identify analytic problems, publication of findings, and the public release of source code and methods appraisals. We expect to complete at least 3-4 major analyses each year. The findings will be used to better understand biological pathways that may identify therapeutic targets."
"9565013","The exploration of genomes, transcriptomes, and proteomes derived from brains with Alzheimer's disease (AD) ? including those provided by the Accelerating Medicines Partnership-AD (AMP-AD) ? by powerful computational tools has the potential of developing new knowledge, including the identification of pathways and targets that may be involved in the initiation and/or progression of the disease. The challenge is validate the importance of those pathways ? distinguishing primary disease drivers from secondary events ? by finding drugs that impact those pathways. Repurposing FDA-approved drugs is one approach to probe potential pathways in proof of concept, and ultimately therapeutic, clinical trials. Here, we propose to discover and validate hypotheses for drug repurposing in AD through three integrated, complementary informatics approaches. This bioinformatics campaign, parallel to a traditional drug campaign, uses AMP-AD data as the ?laboratory? and electronic heath records(EHR) as our ?clinical trial infrastructure?. Specifically, we will apply classical and network aware (prior-loaded) machine learning approaches (which have demonstrated utility in cancer-related omics datasets) to identify pathways and targets altered in AD brains at different stages of disease progression using AMP-AD data (Aim 1); and we will use systems pharmacology approaches to discover the target selectivity of lead compounds in human neuronal and glial cell types using unbiased RNA- seq, proteomic and imaging studies followed by pathway analysis (Aim 2). Aims 1 and 2 each has two approaches: data-driven, hypothesis-generating analyses to discern disease-relevant drug signals; and hypothesis-testing in which positive findings from one approach are evaluated using the other approaches to assess rigor and reproducibility. In Aim 3, we will develop new informatics strategies to conduct in silico drug trials to validate the clinical relevance of drugs by analyzing EHR, taking advantage of the UK 20 year CPRD longitudinal records of 15M people. A second independent EHR data set, the RPDR Database (based at Mass General Hospital) with 6 M individuals followed for over 20 years, will further validate hypotheses based on the omics data sets and extant literature. This coordinated informatics program compensates for the weaknesses of each individual informatics approach to promote discovery and critical evaluation of ?lead compounds? for at least some AD pathways. To execute this strategy, we have assembled a team with expertise ranging from clinical care to computer science and systems pharmacology. Some of the team members are AD experts and others bring an outsider's perspective. Finally, as a deliverable, we will create open-source data packages to release all the supporting evidence, software, and data with provenance in accordance with FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable and reproducible) standards through Synapse and the DataLens platform developed at MGH (Aim 4). These data packages will help to prioritize follow on clinical and translational studies including collaborations with industry or members of the larger biomedical community involved in new clinical trials."
"9566451","Delirium, an acute disorder of attention and cognition, is a common, life-threatening, and potentially preventable clinical syndrome in older persons. Given its adverse impact on functioning and quality of life, delirium holds tremendous healthcare and societal implications for the individual, family, community, and healthcare systems. Despite its importance, fundamental advances in diagnosis, pathophysiology, and treatment have been lagging and there is a compelling need for more effective approaches to advance the field. Responding to RFA-AG-16-009, we propose the development of a collaborative research network, NIDUS (Network for Investigation of Delirium across the U.S.), to advance scientific discovery through a purposeful, coordinated effort. Our specific aims are: (1) To create and maintain a database that will catalog elements and provide an efficient platform to enhance the sharing of data and biospecimens both within and outside the proposed network, facilitating multi-site collaboration, secondary analyses, and pilot studies to catalyze the field; (2) To develop a repository of core measures for delirium identification, diagnosis, and severity, and to harmonize data across all types of delirium studies; (3) To support pilot studies to encourage innovative research, targeted to priority areas (risk factors/prognosis; pathophysiology/biomarkers; diagnostic tools/phenomenology; and clinical interventions); (4) To mentor junior investigators interested in delirium research through training programs, educational resources, and integration into network activities; (5) To disseminate information on research resources, data sharing, training opportunities, and potential collaborations in a timely and effective manner to relevant stakeholders and to the broader scientific community. These synergistic aims will leverage the accumulated research expertise of over 28 delirium leaders (12 coinvestigators/Steering Committee and 16 Scientific Advisory Board members) across 27 institutions (who have committed in-kind support), to create the NIDUS collaborative network. NIDUS will provide a research infrastructure with 2 Resource Cores to provide: (1) a catalog of research resources/ databases and (2) a repository of core delirium measures. These will be augmented with 3 Task Forces providing: (1) pilot grants, (2) mentorship and career development support, and (3) dissemination of information through many approaches (e.g., scientific symposia, annual meetings, and social media). NIDUS will create a unique national resource that will facilitate and catalyze innovation in delirium research through providing core resources and training, targeting priority areas, promoting collaboration across disciplines and institutions, engaging and mentoring junior investigators across fields, and disseminating research findings broadly and effectively. Bringing together diverse multidisciplinary perspectives, including patient/family perspectives, holds great potential to shift research paradigms and enhance innovation. Through targeting delirium, the ultimate goal of the network is to improve healthcare and quality of life for all older persons."
"9329362","Medication errors in the operating room are much more prevalent than traditional incident reports have indicated. In fact, our recent study demonstrated that one in twenty perioperative medication administrations, and every second operation, involves a medication error (ME) and/or adverse drug event (ADE). With more than 50,000 operating rooms conducting 27 million operations annually, this suggests that approximately 15.75 million perioperative MEs occur annually in the U.S. alone. Almost half of these lead to observed patient harm and the remainder have the potential for patient harm. More than two thirds of the harm caused by perioperative medication errors is serious or life-threatening. While not yet widely used in operating rooms, clinical decision support systems have been shown to prevent medication errors and associated patient harm in other patient care areas, and alerts and specific drug decision support have the potential to prevent more than 50% of MEs and 95% of ADEs in the operating room. The primary goals of the proposed research is therefore to design, build and implement platform-independent clinical decision support in the perioperative setting and to evaluate whether the decision support improves patient safety by preventing MEs and/or ADEs. Evidence-based medication-related clinical decision support rules for the operating room will be designed, prioritized and tiered, and finally validated by expert panel using a modified Delphi Approach. The decision rules will be used to develop and implement a perioperative clinical decision support tool that interfaces with existing electronic health records, using user feedback for iterative redesign and optimization. We will study the unintended consequences of the technology implementation with an interrupted time series analysis complemented by qualitative analysis of semi-structured user interviews. Finally, we will conduct a randomized controlled trail to assess the incidence of MEs and ADEs with and without the clinical decision support system, using our previously-described observational technique for ME detection. I will perform the proposed research within the Department of Anesthesia, Critical Care and Pain Medicine at Massachusetts General Hospital, working closely with my mentor Dr. David Bates, a world renowned expert in patient safety, informatics and medication errors, and Chief of the Division of Internal Medicine at Brigham and Women's Hospital, our partner hospital. We have assembled an interdisciplinary team of collaborators and consultants from across Harvard University that have deep expertise and international reputations in patient safety, medical informatics, device interoperability, and qualitative and quantitative statistical methods. This research will be complemented by formal coursework at Harvard University as well as career development workshops at Brigham and Women's Hospital and Massachusetts General Hospital. This combination of intensive research, mentoring and formal education will provide the necessary background for me to become a successful, independent researcher in patient safety, with a focus on the use of informatics to reduce the incidence of perioperative medication errors."
"9312130","Research has shown that Veterans experience better clinical outcomes and are more consistently engaged in mental health treatment when their families are involved in their mental health care. While recent changes in Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) policy place greater emphasis on family involvement in Veterans' mental health care, rates of family psychotherapy provision remain low (under four percent) and have not increased as a proportion of total mental health care service use. More troubling, rates of family psychotherapy for female Veterans are declining as a proportion of service use, despite preliminary evidence that women may benefit most from family involvement. The proposed project will identify patterns of behaviors within marital and cohabitating partnerships that support Veterans' recovery from PTSD and successful family reintegration post-deployment, paying particular attention to gender differences in these associations. Further understanding of the basic processes within partnerships that facilitate or hinder Veterans' reintegration will help providers more effectively engage families in Veterans' mental health care.  The proposed mentored career development award (CDA-1) application details a two-year plan that will provide training to advance candidate Dr. Holly Laws toward a career as an independent researcher at the VA. The project aims to identify patterns of behavior within marital and cohabiting partnerships that are related to male and female Veterans' recovery from PTSD and successful family reintegration as they separate from military service. To accomplish this goal, Dr. Laws will leverage her expertise in dyadic (or two-person) multilevel data analysis and will integrate training in three new areas: 1) VA family research and psychotherapy initiatives, 2) gender differences in Veterans' experiences, and 3) PTSD course, treatment, and evaluation. Mentors expert in these areas will guide Dr. Laws' training activities, provide project mentorship, and support her professional development as an early career VA family researcher.  Research that includes both Veterans and their partners is only beginning to be conducted regularly, with a majority of prior research relying on Veterans' self-reports of their relationships and well-being. This means that VA clinicians have a mandate to include Veterans' families members (most often spouses or partners) in their mental health care, with only limited research indicating how partners' unique characteristics and perspectives can help Veterans' mental health treatment. Further, there are no published studies that compare the partnerships of female Veterans to those of male Veterans.  The proposed study aims to address these two gaps in the current research on Veteran couples by examining how relationship qualities such as distress, trauma disclosure, and conflict relate to PTSD symptoms and family reintegration in Veterans after discharge from military service. The specific contributions of this project are twofold. First, it will differentiate partnership processes as reported by Veterans from those reported by their partners. By disentangling these perspectives, findings can be used to inform Veteran- and partner-specific intervention and engagement strategies in couples' psychotherapy. Second, this project will identify gender differences in how relationship qualities relate to male Veterans' versus female Veterans' well- being. Results from the proposed work will inform a CDA-2 proposal to apply these findings in the development of an evaluation and screening tool that incorporates gender-specific information to meet the differential family engagement needs of male versus female Veterans. A more fine-grained understanding of how processes within partnership relate to the well-being of male and female Veterans could inform targeted psychosocial interventions to change maladaptive patterns within partnerships, or to reinforce those associated with Veterans' improved well-being.  "
"9446434","Project Summary  Most research models of drug resistance are developed in the lab from cancer cell lines; however, their derived  biological history is distinct from what occurs in patients. With the emergence of innovative methods to develop  patient-derived models of cancer (PDMC), new opportunities are available to establish a diverse array of models  representing individual patients? clinical experiences ? enabling identification of the features of tumors that  underlie drug response and resistance in patient tissues. We hypothesize that PDMCs can be used to identify  effective new therapies for breast cancer, and that analysis of cohorts of responding and non-  responding PDMCs can be used to identify markers that predict treatment response or resistance. The  goal of this proposal is to utilize a large and diverse bank of breast PDMCs to screen for new therapies for breast  cancer, with a focus on current NCI-IND agents. We will first use patient-derived organoids (PDOs) to conduct  high throughput screens of NCI-IND drugs as single agents and in combinations of two agents. Each drug and  drug combination will be tested on PDOs from high-risk and metastatic breast tumors from 100 different patients.  Effective ?lead? therapies will then be validated in patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models derived from a subset  of those patients, to include predicted responders and non-responders based on PDO assays. Importantly,  genomic data that is available on all of the PDX models will be utilized to identify proteomic, gene expression  and/or mutational biomarkers associated with responders or non-responders, for each lead therapy. The primary  outcome of this study will be to identify new NCI-IND treatment regimens for breast cancer using PDMCs as a  pre-clinical tool to (1) evaluate the efficacy of many drugs and drug combinations across 100 different patients?  tumor models, and (2) identify the features of responding and non-responding breast cancers for ?lead? therapies,  in order to inform future clinical trial design."
"9360105","PROJECT SUMMARY Reducing use of low-value care ? care for which potential for harm exceeds the possible benefit ? is an attractive but elusive goal in health care. It is one of the few opportunities to increase quality while decreasing spending on care, but there was traditionally little consensus on what constitutes low-value care and little opportunity to measure it and design interventions to target it. That has changed in recent years as a result of physician-led efforts in the United States and other countries to build consensus around what tests and procedures qualify as low-value, and a number of preliminary analyses aimed at quantifying use of low-value care, particularly among Medicare beneficiaries. Many services identified as low-value are routine imaging and laboratory tests. These services can be relatively low-cost and low-risk but they may initiate a cascade of subsequent services, or an entire patient episode of low-value care, with much greater impact on both patient outcomes and health care spending. Little is know about (i) the prevalence and variation in episodes of low- value care, including the cost of subsequent related services stemming from the index test; (ii) the effect of payment reform interventions on use of low-value care and related episodes; and (iii) which characteristics best position a provider organization to reduce use of low-value care. Addressing these knowledge gaps and reducing low-value care will both decrease harm to patients and reduce unnecessary spending. Aim 1 of this study is to construct episodes of low-value testing that include tests, procedures, and treatments related to an initial low-value test, and examine the prevalence and cost per episode. This analysis will build upon previously developed claims-based measures of overuse, and rely on use of 100% fee-for-service Medicare data. Aim 2 will focus on the effect of accountable care organization (ACO) implementation on utilization of episodes of low-value care. The Affordable Care Act authorized the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to contract with ACOs, networks of providers responsible for the health care of a defined population. ACO providers are rewarded financially if they can slow growth in their patients? health care spending while maintaining or improving the quality of care they deliver. Aim 2 will involve assigning Medicare beneficiaries to ACOs using claims data and examining utilization and costs of episodes of low-value care pre- and post-ACO implementation in Medicare ACOs as compared with local control groups. Data from four waves of The National Survey of ACOs will then be linked with Medicare claims to understand, in Aim 3, which ACO characteristics are most closely associated with successful reduction in utilization of low-value care. We will also interview ten high-performing ACOs to identify tactics, facilitators, and challenges to reducing low- value services. This study will provide tools for future measurement of episodes of low-value care and inform the evolution of ACO policy as it pertains to the model?s capacity to reduce utilization of low-value care."

"9408583","PROJECT ABSTRACT Wet Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD) is the leading cause of new blindness among people who are 55 or older. The current standard of care for wet AMD is anti-Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) agents, such as Lucentis, Eylea, and Avastin (used off-label). These anti-VEGF agents inhibit VEGF-mediated angiogenesis, and effectively stop or even reverse the vision loss for most patients. Despite being the best treatment currently available, it has two critical shortcomings: 1) limited near-term vision gain and poor long- term vision maintenance; (2) major cost and treatment burden. First, despite continued treatment, only ~1/3 of the patient gain >3 lines of vision over the first 12 months; after 3-4 years, most patients start losing vision again and eventually dropping to pre-treatment levels. Second, patients must return to the clinic every 1 to 2 months for intravitreal injections ? a specialized, uncomfortable and costly procedure that represents significant treatment burden. The purpose of this SBIR is to develop highly stable aptamers against SDF-1, which may serve as an orthogonal treatment for wet AMD. SDF-1 has long been known to play an important role in choroidal neovascularization (CNV), the landmark pathological process of wet AMD. The Aptitude team has accumulated extensive experience in aptamer discovery. We have previously developed the Particle Display method that significantly improves the aptamer performance. Moreover, we have made further improvement to directly screen for fully modified aptamers that enables longer duration of efficacy. Our expertise in aptamer discovery is complemented by our collaborators? expertise in wet AMD preclinical research. Our collaborator is among the first to demonstrate the role of SDF-1 in CNV, and possess in-depth expertise in relevant animal models. If successful, this project has the potential of bringing more efficacious and affordable treatment to wet AMD patients."
"9522362","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this proposal is to determine how circadian rhythms impact nutrient dependent changes in lifespan. Circadian systems organize critical physiological and behavioral functions by coordinating gene expression and metabolic processes throughout the organism. Disruption of circadian clocks has been linked to accelerated aging and is a risk factor for age-related diseases, such as cancer and diabetes. However, the underlying mechanisms of this association remain unknown. It is becoming evident that in addition to light, nutrients provide significant input into modulating circadian systems, especially peripheral clocks. We hypothesize that circadian clocks impact aging and age-related disease by modulating inputs from nutrients and nutrient sensing pathways. We propose to use D. melanogaster to investigate the link between circadian clocks and aging for the following reasons: 1) their fast generation time and short lifespan, 2) ease of genetic manipulation, 3) established genetic models for understanding aging and disease, 4) an excellent track record for understanding of the biology of circadian clocks, and 5) the conservation of many biological processes and signaling pathways between mammals and invertebrates. Our preliminary evidence demonstrates cross-talk between circadian mechanisms and nutrient sensing pathways on multiple levels. We observed that dietary restriction (DR), which is known to extend lifespan in many species, impacts the circadian clocks. DR led to an increase in amplitude of circadian expression of various circadian clock gene in the whole body. We have demonstrated that circadian clocks are also required for the protective effects of DR on lifespan. Furthermore, we have found that circadian clocks play an important role in enhancing triglyceride turnover which we recently demonstrated is required for the lifespan extension upon DR. To understand the mechanisms by which circadian clocks impact aging, especially in the context of DR, we will undertake the following aims: 1) Determine the impact of nutrients on circadian clocks in an age- dependent and tissue-specific manner, 2) Investigate the role of circadian clocks on nutrient-dependent lifespan changes, 3) Determine how circadian influence the TOR/ILS longevity pathways and fat metabolism, and 4) Determine the downstream mechanisms underlying the contribution of circadian factors to lifespan extension. This will be examined using our preliminary data from circadian genome wide expression profiling upon DR. We will determine how nutrients impact the circadian clocks and whether modulation of circadian clocks and their targets modulate lifespan. These studies have the potential to be paradigm-shifting for the understanding of aging and age-related diseases and initiate the sub-discipline of 'chronogerontology'. In addition to providing a novel amenable target for treatments for age-associated pathologies, they could change research practice in biomedical labs by demonstrating the need to take time-of-day into account in all manipulations/measurements related to aging."
"9565794","Project Summary/Abstract Peripheral artery disease (PAD) is a prevalent illness that affects 12% of U.S adults. The prevalence by race/ethnicity is 22% for African Americans, 13.2% for non-Hispanic Whites, and 13.7% for Latinos. PAD has a profound impact on walking ability including a reduction in walking distance, speed, and stair climbing. Physical inactivity, poor dietary habits and obesity, common among U.S. adults, are significant risk factors for progression of PAD and its adverse outcomes. Prior trials have demonstrated the efficacy of walking therapy to improve function in patients with PAD. Currently, there is a gap in the literature regarding the additive benefit of a dietary intervention with walking therapy to further improve functional outcomes in patients with PAD. To date, the delivery of successful walking therapy interventions has been largely through face-to-face and/or telephone counseling. Widespread uptake of walking interventions has been hampered by the staff- intensity and expense of these interventions. Text messaging avoids this limitation by offering an accessible platform available to most Americans. Text messaging permeates all ages, cultures, and socioeconomic backgrounds. The percent of middle-age to older adults who utilize text messaging ranges from 68% to 83%, making the delivery of behavior change interventions using text messaging a viable option for overweight/obese adults with PAD. The overall objective of this application is to determine the efficacy of a multicomponent, bilingual community-based intervention to promote weight loss and improve walking distance in overweight/obese adults with PAD. We propose to combine the PACE program with a dietary intervention adapted from that used in the successful NIH-funded Look AHEAD trial. This combined dietary (D) and physical activity intervention (PACE) will be delivered using text messaging combined with brief telephone calls - (PACE+Dtext). We will assess the efficacy of PACE+Dtext to promote weight loss in overweight/obese adults, from 3 ethnic groups (African American, Latino [English or Spanish speaking], and non-Hispanic white). This will be the first trial to utilize text messaging to improve outcomes for a racially diverse, high risk population with PAD. We will randomize (n=204) overweight/obese adults with PAD to one of three arms: Tx3: PACE+Dtext; Tx2: PACEtext alone; orTx1: Attention Control (general health and wellness). The dose for the interventions and attention control will be 2 text messages daily, 5 days per week, combined with brief telephone calls, biweekly for 3 months followed by monthly for 3 months. Intervention efficacy at 6- and 12 months will be evaluated for a diverse set of outcomes, including the primary outcome of weight loss and secondary outcomes including walking distance and quality of life."

"9565689","Project Summary The central theme of this application is the effect of education on health at older ages, specifically multimorbidity and its association with disability. Differences in morbidity and mortality as a function of education constitute one of the most consistent findings of epidemiologic research. The effects of education extend into old age as evident in inequalities in functional impairment, disability, and life expectancy. Recent data suggest that ongoing increases in life expectancy are accompanied by widening of educational differences in life expectancy and disability. We identify multiple chronic conditions due to aging of populations and poor understanding of their impact on functioning trajectories and disability as critical to understanding the effects of education on health at older ages. The cross-sectional nature of much of the research on multimorbidity and disability does not allow identification of prevention targets that could be used to close the gap in health stats of older adults. The overall aim of this application is to examine the effects of education on health at older ages using a longitudinal study design, with a follow-up spanning the entire adult lifecourse. Our proposal is based on the Whitehall II study which has pioneered research on health inequalities. The specific focus of the current proposal is multimorbidity, with chronic diseases assessed using gold standard measures and its impact on functioning trajectories, using both measured and reported functioning. A range of psychosocial, behavioral, and biological pathways will be examined. An advantage of our study is comprehensive data on socioeconomic trajectory subsequent to education, allowing estimation of effects of education independent of this pathway. Non-response in the study is low and linkage to electronic health records for all participants, irrespective of their continued participation is a further advantage. We propose to examine education based inequalities in multimorbidity and underlying mechanisms (AIM 1), assess the associations and mechanisms that explain education related differences in measured and reported functioning trajectories and disability over the adult lifecourse (AIM 2), and examine whether education buffers the effect of multimorbidity on disability at older ages and identify underlying mechanisms (AIM 3). Our overarching hypothesis is that multimorbidity and suboptimal control of risk factors explain the greater burden of disability in lower education groups. Health promotion can ensure that older people with chronic conditions and disabilities remain active and independent, preventing institutionalization and declining health. The improvements in life expectancy and disability rates in the high education groups suggests that it is possible to extend these all population groups to ensure that most older people remain healthy, active, and independent for as long as possible. In order to do this, a better understanding of the pathways through which education affects health at older ages is needed; evidence that this proposal aims to generate."
"9418975","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Incidence rates of skins cancers, including melanoma, and squamous and basal cell carcinoma are on the rise among Hispanic/Latinos (H/L). Primary and secondary prevention can reduce the burden of morbidity and mortality due to these skin cancers. Inherited variation at the melanocortin-1 receptor (MC1R) locus is a robust marker of skin cancer risk, and disease risk associated with MC1R variants is often stronger in individuals without traditional clinical risk phenotypes, for example individuals with dark hair color, scant freckles and who do not easily burn. To determine whether knowledge and feedback of MC1R genotype can play a role in the promotion of behaviors linked to risk reduction and early detection of skin cancers, we will randomized 400 H/L participants identified from general internal medicine clinics in Ponce, Puerto Rico and 400 H/L participants identified from family practice clinics in Tampa, Florida to receive mailed health education materials containing either i) generic information about skin cancer risk, risk reduction and early detection (control arm) or ii) precision genetic information about skin cancer risk, risk reduction and early detection anchored in results from MC1R genotyping (intervention arm). We hypothesize that individuals who carry high risk MC1R variants and who receive precision information containing their MC1R genotype information will show improvement in skin cancer risk reduction and early detection behaviors over the course of 9 months. Prevention and early detection behaviors will be measured at baseline and again at 3 and 9 months. Our main outcome measures of interest are number of hours spent in the midday sun (primary prevention outcome) and completion of a skin examination (secondary prevention outcome). We also will assess whether health beliefs, cancer-related distress and worry, knowledge, fatalism, or familism mediate behavior change. In an exploratory fashion, we also will assess the impact of receipt of MC1R genotype on changes in behaviors among children of study participants. Here we will focus on number of sunburns in children as our main outcome of interest. The results of this project will help inform whether genetic screening targeted to the general H/L population of can positively influence risk behaviors associated with skin cancer."
"9450063","Abstract The prefrontal cortex is thought to play a crucial role in cognitive flexibility, in part by updating a person's expectations about the external world and the likely consequences of candidate actions based on the feedback gained from past actions. Deficits in this form of cognition occur in multiple psychiatric conditions in which prefrontal cortex is implicated. Despite much research, the mechanisms by which prefrontal neural circuits contribute to flexible decision-making and switches in cognitive strategy remain unclear. We will examine these issues using reinforcement learning theory, which specifies the optimal strategies for selecting future actions given a subject's past history of actions taken and rewards received. We will first gather the largest set of multi- neuronal recordings ever taken in prefrontal cortex, and then use reinforcement learning theory to analyze the data and deduce the circuit mechanisms by which the prefrontal cortex stores and updates its internal beliefs about the external world and the likely results of future actions.  Past studies in behaving animals have found evidence for individual prefrontal cells that, on average, encode information related to cognitive strategy and action selection, but with limited data it has not been possible to identify how prefrontal circuits maintain and update this information over the course of multiple decisions, actions and outcomes. To collect sufficient data and create better models of prefrontal circuits, we will use a miniature microscope enabling us to monitor large neural ensembles in active mice. Our goals are to: (1) Develop and validate an experimental paradigm for imaging the concurrent dynamics of hundreds of prefrontal cells in mice flexibly switching between two different strategies of spatial navigation. Our pilot data show mice can perform the task well, that prefrontal activity is crucial for strategy-switching, and that prefrontal cortex contains cells whose dynamics appear to signal estimates of the optimal strategy. We will verify mice can follow bona fide navigation strategies and not just memorize spatial paths that yield reward. We will also confirm the prefrontal cells stay healthy and have normal activity patterns throughout the multi-day experiment. (2) Use reinforcement learning theory to analyze our large datasets and create neural circuit models of how prefrontal cortex stores and updates its beliefs to guide future actions. Using the theory we will first create observer-actor models of mouse behavior. We will then apply supervised and unsupervised methods of data analysis to assess whether prefrontal neural ensembles encode task-related, abstract variables such as belief and value. Using our observer-actor models and analyses of neural dynamics, we will train recurrent neural network models to solve the strategy-switching task. The resulting circuit models of reinforcement learning will then yield testable predictions about how the mice and prefrontal cells should behave when we modify the task.  Overall, our study will address key unanswered questions about prefrontal function and seeks to attain a mechanistic understanding of how prefrontal circuits contribute to flexible decision-making."
"9377470","Abstract  The long-term objective of the proposed study is to evaluate the proximal associations among alcohol use and suicidal ideation and attempts. Suicide is a major public health concern for the college student population, as it is the third leading cause of death for persons ages 10 to 24 years old (1). Alcohol use is a well-documented correlate of suicide risk and is alarmingly prevalent in this population (2, 16). Research that elucidates the proximal relationships among alcohol use and suicidal ideation and attempts is imperative to prevent this cause of death in a highly vulnerable population. The integration of theories on the effects of alcohol use (alcohol myopia model; 7) and the causes of suicide (5; interpersonal-psychological theory of suicide) offers a potential explanation of the function of alcohol use in the development of suicide risk. Investigating the proximal relationships among alcohol use and suicidal ideation and attempts will advance the understanding and prevention of suicide in this vulnerable population. The proposed study aims to investigate the proximal associations of alcohol use with suicidal ideation and attempts in 115 men and 115 women college students. Specifically, the proposed study will test a model that integrates the alcohol myopia model and interpersonal-psychological theory of suicide to understand the relationship between alcohol use and suicide risk. That is, the study will examine whether alcohol use facilitates the effects of thwarted interpersonal needs on suicidal ideation, and whether alcohol use facilitates suicide ideators' capability to attempt suicide. Subjects will complete brief daily surveys for 90 consecutive days, which will allow for more accurate reporting on the proximal relationship between alcohol use and suicidal ideation and attempts. The proposed study has potential for informing efforts to reduce alcohol-related deaths by suicide."
"9472043","Abstract  MetaMedia Training International, Inc.

"9552336","Project Summary  The main barriers to functional recovery after spinal cord injury (SCI) are a growth-inhibiting environment and a diminished intrinsic regenerative potential of adult neurons. Current strategies of tackling either extrinsic or intrinsic hurdles enable only limited axonal regeneration. It thus remains critical to gain novel insights into the regulatory mechanisms of glial and neuronal responses after injury. Epigenetic regulation through covalent modification of histones and DNA has emerged as a key player in glial/neuronal plasticity, however, the molecular identity, genomic targets and mechanisms of action of chromatin regulators in SCI remain unclear.  At the injury site, a pro-inflammatory (M1) microglia/macrophage response predominates. Reversing this bias towards an anti-inflammatory, pro-repair M2 phenotype is predicted to facilitate tissue repair. Our preliminary data demonstrated that histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3) is induced in M1 polarized macrophages after SCI, and that its inhibition results in increased M2 polarization and improved locomotor recovery. In Aim 1, we will investigate the basis of the neuroprotective effects of HDAC3 inhibition, focusing on M1/M2 macrophage polarization, cytokine profiles, tissue repair, and locomotor functional recovery. The study will establish HDAC3 as a key epigenetic regulator of the M1/M2 inflammatory gene network in SCI.  Another hurdle for SCI recovery is the diminished intrinsic axon growth potential of adult neurons. Our recent studies established a link between histone acetylation and axon growth potential. Importantly, pharmacological inhibition of HDACs was able to reshape the chromatin landscape in mature neurons after SCI, leading to induction of regeneration-associated genes (RAG) and enhancement of axon regeneration. However, which HDAC isoform is the principal regulator of histone acetylation and RAG expression is not known. In Aim 2, we will adopt cutting-edge cell-type specific methods to examine if selective HDAC1 ablation in DRG sensory neurons would promote RAG induction, histone acetylation dynamics, and axon growth potential. Finally, DNA methylation has emerged as important epigenetic mechanism for gene regulation in neurons. TET3 is a newly characterized enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of methyl-cytosine (5mC) to hydroxymethyl-cytosine (5hmC). Our preliminary studies have identified specific upregulation of TET3, and consistently, 5hmC enrichment in the regenerating DRG neurons. Genome-wide 5hmC mapping revealed unique genomic loci with 5hmC enrichment in the regenerative condition. In Aim 3, we will determine the role of TET3 and 5hmC in RAG induction and axon growth potential by both genetic and epigenetic approaches.  The outstanding strength of our proposal is an integral approach of tackling both extrinsic and intrinsic barriers to axon regeneration. Our study is expected to prioritize currently available reagents and identify novel epigenetic targets and therapeutic directions for SCI."
"9352297","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Despite major investments of money, lime, and effort, patient safety in the United States has seen little improvement. This is because there are many types of adverse events that harm patients, and their underlying causes are extremely heterogeneous. The past approach of addressing one type of harm at a time will result in very minor and slow improvements in overall safety. In addition, it is difficult to detect and measure errors, causation is ambiguous, and care is provided by multiple professions who tend to function autonomously. Also, the vast variety of diseases, medications, and technology add a level of complexity that is beyond the scope of traditional approaches to improving safety. Most U.S. healthcare organizations have unsuccessfully tried to address patient safety with a top-down approach as they respond to an overwhelming number of externally mandated safety practices which ignore the Wisdom of frontline caregivers, create cultures that emphasize accountability over learning, and in the end, only address a fraction of the harm that occurs. Frontline caregivers must be trained and engaged in all aspects patient safety measurement and improvement.           The goal of University of Texas at Houston (UTH) Patient Safety Learning Laboratory (UTPSLL) is to create an environment of collaborative learning focused on reducing all-cause preventable harm by 50% in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). Five cores of experts in; 1) Robust Process Improvement (methods of Lean, Six Sigma, and change management); 2) electronic health records; 3) parent engagement; 4) patient safety measurement; and 5) project administration and leadership will collaborate with clinician leaders, frontline caregivers, and parents from Memorial Hermann Health System NICUs to reduce all preventable harms."
"9472109","Project Summary Psoriasis is an inflammatory skin disorder with abnormal epidermal hyperproliferation, which affects 2-3 % of the US population. There are no reliable in vitro models with which the efficacy and safety of psoriasis drug candidates can be tested. To meet this major unmet pharmaceutical need, we will combine iPSC reprograming and 3D bioprinting technologies to construct a 3D skin model to screen for drugs to treat this disease. iPSC methodology will be used, because iPSCs have unlimited proliferation potential and the capability to differentiate into different cell lineages, which allows us to circumvent the limitation imposed by the limited availability of primary cells that can be procured from patients. We successfully constructed 3D skin using exclusively iPSC-derived cells (fibroblasts and keratinocytes), demonstrating the feasibility of this approach. 3D bioprinting can allow us to reproducibly construct complex structures to recapitulate human tissues/organs. In this project, we will first construct immunocompetent 3D skin with primary keratinocytes, fibroblasts and T cells. Then, iPSCs will be reprogramed from fibroblasts or blood cells obtained from normal and psoriatic individuals. Keratinocytes and fibroblasts will be differentiated from iPSCs for construction of 3D skin models, whereas the abundant availability of T cells allows us to use cells directly from primary sources. Bioprinted psoriasis-specific iPSC derived skin constructs will be used for disease modeling and pharmacological validation. CRISPR technology will be used to integrate fluorescent reporters in iPSC-derived keratinocytes to monitor disease induction of psoriasis and effect of drug treatment. Completion of this project will provide us with a reliable 3D bioprinted model to develop drugs to treat psoriasis. Moreover, our 3D skin model can be easily adapted and modified to screen for drugs to treat other skin diseases, using a platform approach."
"9350852","SUMMARY A set of experiments is proposed to develop a new mineral-based nanoparticle technology for modulating the cellular activity in absence of growth factors for regenerative therapies. Current therapeutic approaches to regulate cellular responses include delivery of a multitude of supraphysiological doses of growth factors that results in a range of complications, including uncontrolled tissue formation, inflammation, and tumorogenesis. These adversely limit the usage of growth factors as a therapeutic agent in the field of regenerative medicine. In this New Innovator Award, I propose to develop new mineral-based nanoparticles to regulate and direct the differentiation of human stem cells in the absence of growth factors. It is our expectation that adequate and efficacious grow-factor free therapeutics can be designed for regenerative medicine by leveraging our knowledge about the molecular signaling induced by minerals. This research proposal is particularly well suited for this unique funding mechanism because it proposes innovative, high-risk, and high-reward research at the interface of bioengineering and stem cells that would have a major impact on repair and regeneration of damaged tissue. We propose to combine principles of high throughput computational genomics, stem cell biology, materials science, microfabrication, and regenerative medicine to design novel strategies based on newly emerging but unexplored concepts of mineral-induces cellular signaling. It is our expectation that a comprehensive understanding of the molecular pathways regulated by the usage of minerals will radically alter the current growth-factor based approach to repair and regenerate damage tissue. !"
"9445623","PROJECT SUMMARY Pain (Dolor) is one of the four cardinal signs of inflammation, and often accompanies bacterial infections. Nociceptor neurons are the peripheral sensory neurons that mediate pain, which densely innervate barrier tissues including the skin and soft tissues that are exposed to pathogens. Streptococcus pyogenes is a leading cause of necrotizing fasciitis, an invasive and life-threatening form of infection, in which pain occurs early and ?out of proportion? with other symptoms. We hypothesize that pain plays a major causative role in the pathogenesis of S. pyogenes, by inducing neural mediated suppression of innate immune cell recruitment and killing of bacteria. Here, we will determine: 1) The molecular mechanisms of pain during S. pyogenes infection, with a focus on streptococcal pore-forming toxins streptolysin S (SLS) and streptolysin O (SLO), and 2) The role of nociceptors and pain signaling in regulating neutrophil function and host defense against S. pyogenes. We test the hypothesis that targeting pain signaling would lead to enhanced innate immune responses. Given the importance of pain in the diagnosis of necrotizing fasciitis, and the widespread use of analgesics, our findings connecting pain to S. pyogenes host defense could have important clinical implications. The two aims of this study leverage the complementary skills of Dr. Chiu and Dr. Wessels, combining neurobiological, immunological, and microbiological approaches to investigate the role of pain in host defense. In Specific Aim 1, we will determine the critical molecular mechanisms of pain production during S. pyogenes infection by two clinical isolates. We use isogenic mutant bacterial strains and plasmid complementation strategies together with neurobehavioral assays to determine whether SLS and SLO mediate S. pyogenes-induced pain. We will determine whether the inflammasome and IL-1? are involved in neuronal recognition of pore-forming toxins or pain signaling. In addition, we determine the effectiveness of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in impacting pain perception during S. pyogenes infection. In Specific Aim 2, we will determine how targeted ablation of TRPV1+ nociceptors using RTX treatment or Trpv1-cre/DTA mice enhances host defenses against S. pyogenes. We will determine how temporally and spatially controlled modulation of TRPV1+ neural activity using optogenetic or DREADD strategies affects the outcome of S. pyogenes infection. We will also utilize opioids to block central pain perception or Botulinum toxin to block peripheral pain signaling to determine which neural component modulates immune responses against S. pyogenes. In our analysis, we elucidate the role of nociceptor-derived neuropeptides such as CGRP in suppressing neutrophil phagocytosis and killing of S. pyogenes. This study analyzes a significant link between induction of pain signaling, neural blockade of innate immunity, and the potentiation of S. pyogenes bacterial pathogenesis. Targeting pain and neuro-immune suppression could lead to novel approaches to treatment of this and other invasive bacterial infections."
"9310311","ABSTRACT Despite significant improvements in prevention and treatment of cardiovascular disease (CVD), the growing aging population suggests CVD will continue to pose a significant public health burden. Women are a special group where microvascular disease is more common and traditional risk factors may not fully identify risk. Women's reproductive history (e.g. menarcheal age, menstrual cycles, infertility, pregnancy, menopause) may pose unique risk and suggests an opportunity for new approaches. We propose a women-centered approach for early identification of women at risk that investigates the unique loss of reproductive function at an age long before other vital systems fail. Despite the importance of this process, little is known about the determinants or correlates of ovarian aging, or the health implications, especially in diverse populations. With reliable bio-markers of the remaining oocyte pool available, we have a unique opportunity to characterize the association between ?ovarian age? and the health implications of accelerated oocyte loss. We hypothesize a risk independent of the well-known impact of early menopause and estrogen deficiency. Rather, we propose that common underlying cellular aging mechanisms, first evident in the ovary due to its sensitivity and earlier demise, make the ovary a window on underlying somatic health. Confirming an association between a decline in markers of ovarian age and CVD risk would allow a potentially high-risk population to be identified decades before traditional risk factors develop. The Ovarian Aging (OVA) cohort is the largest and most ethnically diverse, community-based cohort available that can be used to determine the race/ethnic and behavioral determinants of ovarian aging and its association with CVD risk in a young cycling population. To assess the relationship between markers of ovarian age (reflecting past exposures and genetic risk), the rate of ovarian aging (representing current exposures) and CVD risk, we propose to: 1. Determine whether markers of ovarian age/aging are associated with increased CVD risk by testing if ovarian age/aging is independently associated with increased CVD risk, as measured by peripheral endothelial function testing; 2. Determine whether ovarian aging may moderate or mediate established associations between race/ethnicity and/or socio/emotional health and CVD risk by examining whether observed race/ethnic disparities, or effects of socio/emotional health, on CVD risk, may vary by (moderation model) or be partially attributable to (mediation model) ovarian aging; and 3. Determine whether ovarian aging, CVD risk, and the temporal pattern of appearance correlate with markers of cellular aging: telomere length and mtDNA in peripheral leukocytes, oxidative stress (plasma F2?-isoprostanes), and indices of inflammation (C-reactive protein, interleukin- 6, and soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1). Overall Impact: Our novel longitudinal approach to evaluating markers of ovarian and cellular aging as predictors of CVD could lead to a new way to identify women at earlier and/or increased CVD risk and be used to develop new risk-reduction strategies."
"9429358","ABSTRACT Lewy body dementia (LBD) is a prevalent disorder that is characterized by impaired attention and executive function, visual hallucinations, parkinsonian features, sleep difficulty, and worse functional and survival outcomes than Alzheimer's disease (AD) or Parkinson's disease (PD). The two clinical entities of LBD, Parkinson's disease dementia (PDD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), are heterogeneous. Although they share a common neuropathological finding, namely Lewy pathology, they have variable disease courses and treatment strategies. Yet current diagnostic procedures to distinguish these subtypes are imprecise and thus pose an important challenge for timely clinical diagnosis and for research. We will therefore leverage existing resources (e.g., postmortem brain tissue, DNA samples, genotypes, and methylome data) to advance the discovery of unique peripheral biomarkers for DLB and PDD. Epigenetic modifications have been identified as capable of altering transcriptional activity across multiple genes and biological pathways. A state-of-the-art technological method known as whole- genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) has been used to construct methylome maps for human cells and provides unbiased interrogation of the approximately 3 million quantifiable CpG sites. The detection of disease-dependent DNA methylation patterns that are concordant between peripheral blood leukocytes (PBLs) and postmortem brain (PMB) tissue in PD suggests that methylation profiles may serve as a readily accessible biomarker for LBD. However, previous studies did not include genome-wide interrogation. We thus propose the following 3 aims to identify unique epigenetic profiles in LBD. Aim 1. Generate whole-methylome from the PMBs and PBLs of LBD subjects using WGBS. We will perform whole-methylome sequencing in frontal cortical and PBL samples selected from a well- characterized national LBD consortium and the University of Washington Neuropathology Core. Aim 2. Define differentially methylated regions (DMRs) that are specifically associated with LBD. We will detect concordant methylation profiles in LBD, thereby identifying potential peripheral biomarkers that serve as a good proxy for methylation alterations in the brain. Aim 3. Validate DMRs identified in Aim 2 in additional PBL samples using targeted bisulfite sequencing. We will verify our findings in samples selected from the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center and the PDBP. We hypothesize that we will identify concordant methylation alterations in brain and blood in LBD, and we expect that a subset of these DMRs will be verified in additional PBLs. These findings will thereby constitute novel sources for biomarker discovery and development in accessible tissue."
"9384174","Project Abstract  Objects in nature can be better detected or localized by integrating information across multiple senses. Much of the focus in the literature has been on ?facilitation?, the degree to which, for example, an audiovisual (AV) stimulus evokes responses that are faster or more precise than that achieved with the faster or more precise of the two modalities. The project proposed focuses on a different type of facilitation, first reported in humans, in which performance with bimodal stimuli combines the best features of each modality alone. The applicant?s lab demonstrated a similar result in the barn owl (Tyto alba): An owl turns its head toward auditory targets with shorter latencies but lower precision than toward visual targets. Conversely, head-turns to visual targets take longer to initiate, but are more precise. AV-guided head-turns are both fast and precise, but neither faster nor more precise than to audition and vision, respectively. Correspondingly, neuronal latencies in the owl?s optic tectum (OT), an area involved in the direction of gaze, are shorter for auditory stimuli than for visual stimuli. Conversely, visual spatial receptive fields (SRFs) are finer than auditory SRFs. This novel form of multisensory enhancement will be studied neurophysiologically and behaviorally, guided by the hypothesis that auditory information arrives in the OT first, triggering the head turn. The visual information, arriving later, helps to refine the trajectory of the head turn. Each aim is guided by an organizing question: Aim 1. Do owls update only if later arriving information improves localization or does it update to the later arriving information even at the expense of performance? We will blur the visual component of an AV stimulus to determine whether information from the blurred visual component is incorporated or ignored. Aim 2. Auditory and visual input arrives at the OT with different latencies. What is the delay between the auditory and visual streams beyond which updating is no longer observed? We will test two alternative hypotheses: 1.) Updating is limited by a fixed time window that closes during a saccade, or 2.) Updating requires the temporal overlap between the tectal neural responses to auditory and visual stimuli. To distinguish between these ideas, we will vary the duration of sound as we test various time delays between the auditory and visual components of AV stimuli. Aim 3. Is updating exclusive to multimodal stimuli? A sequential pair of unimodal auditory and visual stimuli will be presented in which the localizability of stimuli are altered to determine whether or not information from both senses is necessary."
"9336233","Project Summary/Abstract Youth violence is a major threat to the health and wellbeing of youths in the U.S. Our project focuses on Richmond, Virginia, a medium-sized city that is ravaged by violence and poverty. In 2014, the rate of homicide among youths was nearly four times the national average. Although prevention science has shown progress in identifying promising youth violence prevention programs that focus on the individual-, family-, or school-levels, progress on community-level interventions has been scarce. Our project involves the implementation of a community level approach employing the Communities That Care prevention system (CTC), enhanced with the Walker-Talker (WT) community outreach program (CTC PLUS). While the CTC builds and cultivates social capital through coalition building and identification and implementation of evidence-based youth violence programs, the WT model will increase community capacity and awareness to make full use of these resources. The overall goal of this project is to implement and evaluate the community-level impact of the CTC PLUS strategy within the context of a multiple-baseline design. Our specific objectives include: a) determine the effectiveness of CTC PLUS on primary youth violence outcomes (e.g., youth homicides and intentional injury rates), b) determine the extent to which CTC PLUS leads to proximal outcomes including decreased neighborhood disorganization, increased numbers of youth served by high quality, evidence-based violence prevention programs, and decreased risk and increased protective/promotive factors associated with youth violence, and c) understand the impact of CTC PLUS on aspects of neighborhood and community capacity associated with youth violence prevention. Three comparable communities will be randomly assigned to receive the intervention at different implementation starting dates. The intervention will begin in the first randomly selected community (Community A), while the other two communities (Communities B and C) serve as controls. The following year, the second randomly selected community (Community B) will begin the intervention (along with the first intervention community), while the third community serves as a control. In years 4 and 5, communities A and B will continue implementing the intervention. This design will provide adequate time (i.e., 3-4 years) for the intervention effect to emerge in Communities A and B. The third community (Community C) will receive training and technical support for implementing the intervention following the last wave of data collection in Year 5 (i.e., representing a no-intervention control community during this funding period). This randomization of multiple elements of the design (i.e., both the order in which the communities receive the intervention and the timing) strengthens this design considerably because it increases the number of possible assignments while maintaining the systematic staggering of the intervention introduction. This provides a basis for conducting parametric analyses and alternative analytic strategies that make fewer assumptions about the data. If proven effective, this innovative intervention will advance the science and practice of youth violence prevention and have significant public health implication."
"9446791","The overall aim of this application is to better understand the role of impaired glucagon suppression in the mechanisms that lead to diabetes. Of the various common genetic variants associated with type 2 diabetes that in TCF7L2, has the strongest effect on disease predisposition and might provide insight into various diverse mechanisms that drive the progression of prediabetes to diabetes. We have discovered an effect of diabetes-associated variation in TCF7L2 on glucagon suppression. The product of this locus is an important constituent of the wnt-signaling cascade that was originally shown to regulate proglucagon gene expression. In addition, ?-cell function as quantified by the Disposition Index (DI) is also impaired. We propose to examine the temporal relationship of the effects of this locus on ?-cell and on ?-cell function in people with normal glucose tolerance or prediabetes to help examine if impaired glucagon suppression contributes to an increased rate of ?-cell dysfunction or if the two processes develop independently. Since ?-cell dysfunction has previously been overlooked in the pathogenesis of prediabetes, we will harness the Mayo Autopsy resource to examine islet morphology in humans with and without diabetes-associated variation at this locus. Our preliminary data suggests that ?-cell size and glucagon expression is increased in subjects with the T-allele at rs7903146 in the TCF7L2 locus. Finally we hope to improve the ability of the oral minimal model ? the gold standard used to measure ?-cell function in vivo ? to measure glucose homeostasis by incorporating a component that describes glucagon secretion and action. This will help elucidate the mechanism by which TCF7L2 leads to type 2 diabetes in humans but will also provide insights into the role of glucagon in the pathogenesis of prediabetes and progression to diabetes."
"9483545","Abstract/Summary This proposal is submitted by the HJF Medical Research International (HJFMRI) in response to announcement RFA-GH-16-006, Conducting Public Health Research in Kenya, a funding opportunity from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The purpose of this cooperative agreement is to conduct and monitor epidemiologic, clinical- and laboratory-based studies of important human diseases in Kenya. In collaboration with the Kenya Medical Research Institute (KEMRI), we are applying for Components A, B, C, D and E. For Component A, the Division of Global Health Protection, our proposal addresses, for example: surveillance for infectious zoonotic diseases in animals, covering causes of diseases in livestock and quantifying the linkages between the health of people and the animals with which they live; and the role of pathogens in acute febrile illness (AFI), characterizing the epidemiology, including seasonality of AFI. For Component B, our proposal covers, for example, identification of clinical, epidemiologic and nutritional characteristics of patients hospitalized with respiratory illness and risk factors, in settings like western Kenya, which may further predispose pregnant women to severe outcomes from influenza, especially in relationship to influenza vaccination. For Component C, we include proposed projects, such as determination of the effectiveness of patient delivered partner therapy in reducing Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhea re-infection in conjunction with assessment of the prevalence and incidence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. For Component D, for instance, we consider measuring schistosome antigens in oral fluid samples via detection of Circulating Cathodic Antigen (CCA) and present a sampling design to assess the therapeutic efficacy of Artemisinin-based combination therapies for symptomatic, uncomplicated P. falciparum infection among children. Finally, for Component E, for example, we propose a study to measure the effectiveness of three different strategies to increase the TB case detection rate compared to the standard approach, Directly Observed Treatment (DOTS) as implemented in Kenya. Each of our proposed projects is consistent with and beneficial to furthering CDC Kenya's mission to promote health through collaboration on science, policy and evidence-based public health actions. Collaborative public health research is HJFMRI's forte, and we offer our expertise in management to fulfill CDC strategic priorities."
"9323300","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The primary etiologic factors leading to the sporadic (non-familial) form of the lethal neurodegenerative disease amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) remain unknown. The National ALS Registry collects information on environmental risk factors from patients who register through the on-line portal. However, it is not known how representative the risk factor data in the National ALS Registry are in comparison with the population of ALS patients as a whole. We will develop a surveillance program that will achieve complete ascertainment of ALS cases in Northern / Central Ohio (Specific Aim 1). We will conduct a population case control study of risk factors for ALS based on data collected with a specially designed environmental questionnaire from the patients collected in the Ohio surveillance program and randomly selected population control subjects from the same region (Specific Aim 2). We will compare ALS patients to random controls with regard to levels of exposure to the cyanobacterial neurotoxin, ?-N-methylamino-L-alanine (BMAA), and other environmental toxicants, including lead, mercury and pesticides, as potential risk factors for sporadic ALS. The central hypothesis is that the risk of developing ALS increases with dose and duration of exposure to these risk factors in susceptible individuals. Exposures will be determined by: (i) history of exposure to cyanobacteria and involvement in at-risk occupations, using questionnaire data; (ii) dietary intake of mercury, using questionnaire data on fish consumption and databases of methylmercury in fish; and (iii) the geospatial distribution of residential exposure to environmental toxins/toxicants. Mapping of at-risk exposures will include: (i) lifetime residential histories; (ii) sources of potential environmental toxicants (Brownfield ad Superfund sites, hazardous waste sites, agricultural pesticides) and cyanobacteria in waterbodies (Specific Aim 3). The geographical mapping program will be a case control study of exposures in Ohio ALS surveillance program patients and random controls from the general population. The content of cyanobacteria in waterbodies throughout Northern / Central Ohio will be determined using a combination of direct sampling and aerosol collections from waterbodies, and calibrated satellite remote sensing. Our approach is innovative; it is the first comprehensive ALS surveillance program in Ohio, a state with many hazardous waste sites that also borders Lake Erie, which has massive cyanobacterial blooms; it is the first in-depth analysis of exposure to cyanobacteria as a risk factor for ALS in Ohio; and it is the first comprehensive analysis of th relative risks of the full range of incriminated environmental risk factors for ALS using geospatia mapping. Identifying the specific environmental toxins/toxicants that increase risk of ALS will enable exposure reduction initiatives to prevent this debilitating and lethal disease."
"9327663","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a prevalent and devastating chronic disease, affecting >29 million people in the United States (US). Health insurance and continued access to healthcare services are essential for optimal DM care and management; therefore, it is hypothesized that Affordable Care Act (ACA) Medicaid expansions could substantially improve access to health insurance and healthcare services for patients at risk for DM or already diagnosed with DM (`with DM risk or DM'). The ACA called for every state to significantly expand Medicaid coverage by 2014; little is yet known about the impact of ACA Medicaid expansion on the prevention, treatment, expenditures, and outcomes of patients with DM risk or DM. In a 2012 legal challenge, the US Supreme Court ruled that states were not required to implement ACA Medicaid expansions; thus (by January 1, 2015), 28 states and the District of Columbia expanded Medicaid, while 22 states did not. This `natural experiment' presents a unique opportunity to learn whether and to what extent Medicaid expansion can affect healthcare access and services for patients with DM risk or DM. We will use this unprecedented natural experiment to expand our understanding of how Medicaid expansion impacts DM prevention, treatment, expenditures, and health outcomes. We will use electronic health record (EHR) data from the ADVANCE clinical data research network, which has data from 718 community health centers (CHCs), including 470 CHCs in 12 Medicaid expansion states and 248 CHCs in 9 non-expansion states. From this dataset, we will collect detailed information on changes in health insurance, service receipt, and health outcomes, with data spanning 9 years (pre- and post-expansion), comparing states that expanded Medicaid, and those that did not. Moreover, building on our prior work, we will link EHR data from 213 Oregon ADVANCE CHCs to Oregon Medicaid claims data to assess Medicaid expenditures among patients with DM risk or DM. The specific aims are as follows: Aim 1. Compare pre-post insurance status, overall visits, and chronic disease management visits among patients with DM risk or DM, in expansion versus non-expansion states. Aim 2. Compare pre- post receipt of primary and secondary DM preventive services (e.g., screening for obesity, lipid levels, glycosylated hemoglobin) among patients with DM risk or DM, in expansion versus non-expansion states. Aim 3. Compare pre-post changes in DM-related biomarkers (e.g., body mass index, blood pressure, lipid levels) in patients with DM risk or DM among newly insured (gained Medicaid in post-period), already insured (had Medicaid coverage in pre- and post-period), and continuously uninsured (pre- and post-period) patients in states that expanded Medicaid. Aim 4. Measure pre-post changes in Oregon Medicaid expenditures among newly insured compared to already insured patients with DM risk or DM. Findings will be relevant to policy and practice, informing further improvements in the US healthcare system to ensure access for vulnerable populations and mitigate disparities in DM prevention, treatment, and health outcomes."
"9343397","Project Summary/Abstract Activating mutations in KRAS, BRAF and EGFR are the underling cause of a large number of deadly human cancers. A single missense amino acid mutation in these genes causes cancers of diverse origins including a large number of pancreatic, lung, skin, and colorectal cancers. The general signaling pathway affected by these mutations, the so-called RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK pathway (ERK signaling), is a major target of drug design by pharmaceutical companies. However, regardless of the molecular target (activated BRAF or EGFR, for example), this approach has been hindered due to the emergence of drug resistance in nearly all cases. To tackle this important human disease there is a need for new groundbreaking unconventional approach to cancer treatment. We propose to establish a potentially transformative approach to treating these cancers, which we refer to as Enhancer RNA Therapy. Indeed, we believe this plan will be applicable to a wide spectrum of human diseases. Our proposal hinges on our discovery of the functional importance of enhancer RNAs (eRNAs); noncoding RNAs that are transcribed from tissue and disease-specific enhancers. Enhancers are DNA elements that govern spatial and temporal regulation of gene expression during development and disease. Aberrant regulation of enhancers is considered to be a key event in the genesis and progression of cancer. We aim to target disease-induced eRNAs to silence cancer-causing genes as a transformative treatment in cancers induced by activating mutations of KRAS, BRAF and EGFR. We will develop an atlas of disease-induced enhancers in multiple cancers with activating mutations in KRAS and BRAF. We will then functionally characterize these cancer-induced enhancers using genetic and functional approaches. Finally, in collaboration with Isis Pharmaceuticals, we will develop derivatized anti-sense oligonucleotides (ASOs) that will neutralize the oncogenic eRNAs in vivo allowing for tissue specific inhibition of pathogenic gene expression in cancer. We therefore propose to investigate the feasibility of 'Enhancer RNA Therapy' using cancers with activating mutations in ERK signaling pathway as a model system."
"9566427","Abstract Apolipoprotein (apo) E is a lipid transport protein that is considered a longevity factor. While the detrimental effects of the human apoE4 isoform have been recognized and studied for quite some time, only recently has apoE2 emerged as being associated with healthy aging and exceptional old age. The proposed studies seek to identify underlying cellular mechanisms by which apoE2 exerts its beneficial effects. Study aims will be advanced using cell- and mouse-models expressing each of the human apoE isoforms. The overarching hypothesis of these studies is that cellular apoE isoforms modulate the expression and activity of membrane ABC transporters, with apoE2 showing prominent positive effects. These membrane proteins mediate the transport of solutes across cellular membranes, and therefore play central roles in biology, maintaining healthy aging and protecting against numerous diseases such as diabetes, cardiovascular and Alzheimer's diseases. As such, an understanding of how cellular apoE regulates ABC transporters will facilitate the identification of new therapeutic- and diagnostic- targets to combat disease. A series of cell-based, hypothesis-driven studies are proposed to investigate the effects of each apoE isoform on specific ABC transporters involved in lipid homeostasis. Targeted ?omic? technologies will be used to define metabolic phenotypes associated with each apoE isoform, which tract to ABC transporter function. Novel cryo-EM and 3D modeling techniques will be employed to investigate the ultrastructure of cells, and whether the size, shape, and number of cytoplasmic organelles correlate with these metabolic phenotypes. Experiments will be performed under basal and oxidative stress conditions, thereby providing detailed insights into the function of cells, their resilience, and the changes that occur during disease development in relation to each of the human apoE isoforms. Mimetic peptides based on favorable apoE2 responses will be developed, and used to investigate structure-activity relationships. In vivo mouse studies will also be performed to validate new mechanisms associated with apoE2/mimetic peptides, identifying metabolite- and lipid-biomarkers linked to the function of specific ABC transporters for clinical applications."
"9330004","Project Summary/Abstract The Blood-Brain Barrier (BBB) comprises a physical and enzymatic interface between the CNS and the peripheral circulation. Communication between the CNS and vasculature is mediated through what has been termed the neurovascular unit (NVU), a highly dynamic structure. Migraine with aura is a multiphase, neurological disorder that affects 32 million Americans (14.2% of US adults), with an estimated annual cost of 17 billion dollars in the United States, that is characterized by excruciating pain and cortical dysfunction (i.e. cortical spreading depression, CSD). Both CSD and pain weaken the integrity of the BBB. A clear comprehension of biological mechanisms regulating migraine-induced alterations of the BBB is vital to understand the efficacy of antimigraine drugs during migraine. In response to PA-14-068 (Neurobiology of Migraine), investigating changes in BBB permeability (i.e. blood to CNS uptake of brain impermeant compounds) and tight junction composition (i.e., occludin, claudins, etc.) will enable an improved understanding of the role of the BBB in the development of episodic migraine. Disruption of the BBB by pain and CSD may alter analgesic efficacy or CNS toxicity of anti-migraine therapeutics, including first-line therapies like triptan compounds. Elucidating how these migraine features (i.e., pain, CSD) contribute to the functional expression of drug transporters (i.e., organic anion transporting polypeptides (OATPs) and Na+-H+ exchangers (NHEs)) may uncover mechanisms required for triptan analgesia at varying stages of migraine (prodromal, headache and postdrome phases) and lead to the identification of novel therapeutic strategies to treat migraine. Completion of these studies will advance our understanding of BBB integrity during episodic migraine and determine how CNS uptake of antimigraine therapeutics is regulated during attacks. Our preliminary data strongly suggest that the BBB integrity is dynamically compromised with migraine progression which, in turn, alters antimigraine medication blood to CNS uptake. We demonstrate that dural pinprick ± cortical KCl in freely moving, non-anesthetized female rats: 1) induces CSD and 2) induces long-lasting periorbital allodynia and head-tucking behavior. Moreover, we show evidence supporting that BBB integrity changes after dural pinprick ± KCl including: 3) enhanced whole brain uptake of 14C-sucrose, Evans? Blue Albumin and 3H- sumatriptan; 4) increased protein expression of OATP1A4, a transporter implicated in CNS uptake of numerous medications; and 5) decreased levels of NHE1 protein, a proton exchanger, as compared to controls; these may alter sumatriptan uptake kinetics. These preliminary findings led to our hypothesis that dysregulation of BBB integrity is driven by the different migraine phases increasing the severity and duration of headache while regulating anti-migraine medication blood-to-CNS uptake to mitigate the disorder. The aims of this grant will be investigated using a combination of electrophysiological, behavioral measurements, in situ perfusion, and molecular techniques established and working in our laboratories. Specifically Aim 1 proposes studies to determine the BBB integrity, including permeability and molecular composition, during the three phases of migraine (prodromal, headache and postdrome phases), while Aim 2 studies will elucidate the CNS uptake of antimigraine agents during migraine. Completed studies will address significant gaps in our knowledge regarding BBB integrity during episodic migraine and CNS uptake of antimigraine therapeutics to aid in the treatment of patients suffering from migraine."
"9453482","Neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases affect the increasing aging populations worldwide. Disruption of lysosomal functions has been identified to be associated with these diseases. At least 11 genes out of 24 loci identified to be associated with Parkinson's disease are involved in or disrupt the autophagy-lysosome pathway. Our long term objective is to understand how lysosomes play an important role in clearance of excessive or toxic proteins and organelles and their potential as targets for therapeutic intervention for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. A key therapeutic strategy is to develop approaches to decrease pathogenic protein toxicity and spreading. This application will specifically test the hypothesis that strategies that enhance lysosomal function decrease pathogenic ?-synuclein burden and neurodegeneration in vivo. Novel genetic interventions that enhance lysosomal activities will be used to focus on rigorously examining 1) neurological deficit, 2) ?-synuclein accumulation and 3) neurodegeneration, in mice injected with preformed fibrils. Success of this study may provide long lasting impact regarding how lysosomal functions may be affected by a transcription repressor and a specific lysosomal enzyme, and regarding how lysosomal regulators and enzymes affect neuronal function and survival."
"9403395","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT This proposal is submitted in response to RFA-DK-16-510, ?Limited Competition for the Data Coordinating Center (DCC) for the NIDDK Inflammatory Bowel Disease Genetics Consortium (IBDGC) (U24)?. IBD affects 1.8 to 3 million Americans; better therapies and more rational use of multiple emerging therapies are urgently needed. Over 200 loci have been associated to IBD, prioritizing cells, genes and pathways that drive pathogenesis. The IBDGC, comprised of the DCC and six Genetic Research Centers (GRCs) throughout North America brings together large IBD referral centers to perform well-powered genetic, expression and functional studies. Novel protocols for intestinal sampling and longitudinal follow-up are needed to define precise cellular and molecular mechanisms. In Aim 1, the DCC will apply new laboratory and computing technologies to collect accurate, detailed data on disease pathogenesis from the clinic all the way down to the cellular level, and to integrate these data with both existing and new genomic data for sharing with the research community. Platforms for longitudinal collections, integration with top collaborating laboratories, and development of new objective assessments of disease activity and responses to treatment are described. The Bionimbus Protected Data Cloud will facilitate collaborative analyses, and data sharing will be enhanced through an IBD Data Commons. In Aim 2, prioritization of scientific directions and incorporation of new technologies, sampling strategies and analyses is proposed. Key factors include efficiently scaling processes across centers, minimizing and defining analytic and other sources of variation, and longitudinal analyses. Enhancement of credible SNP set definitions will be achieved through increasing power through increased sample sizes of genome-wide association study SNP sets, combining analyses across inflammatory diseases, and integrating more diverse populations. Comprehensive expression analyses of a spheroid collection of inflamed and uninflamed samples derived from ulcerative colitis (UC) patients will define mRNA expression variation driven by genetic variability, thereby defining drivers of UC pathogenesis. Finally, in a large cohort of Crohn's disease patients undergoing ileal resectional surgery, the genetic basis for how pathophysiologic mechanisms function over time will be defined. This large sample set will enable the examination of genetic variation in response to therapeutic interventions and over time. The long-term goal of these studies is to efficiently develop approaches to most effectively treat IBD patients, catalyzing the advent of Precision IBD."
"9484500","Project Summary/Abstract  Stomach or gastric cancer is the fifth most common cancer and the third leading cause of cancer mortality in the world, with a disproportionate burden experienced among Asians globally and Asian Americans in the US. Stomach cancer incidence among Chinese Americans is nearly twice that of non-Hispanic whites. In New York City (NYC), Asian men have twice the stomach cancer mortality of non-Hispanic white men and Asian women have the highest rates across all racial/ethnic groups. The bacterium Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) is the strongest risk factor for stomach cancer. Up to 75% of all stomach cancer cases in the US present with late- stage disease, underscoring the need for more prevention and early detection. H. pylori eradication through triple antibiotic therapy is the most effective prevention method, however, it requires patient education and provider support to yield high adherence, especially for limited English and low health literacy populations. Many patients at high risk for stomach cancer enter primary care and endoscopy clinics for dyspepsia symptoms associated with H. pylori, thus representing a key window for prevention. H. pylori eradication efforts in the US, however, are limited in practice and poorly integrated within health systems. Health information technology (HIT) and community health worker (CHW)-led interventions have demonstrated effectiveness in improving screening, treatment, and follow-up care to bridge this gap, yet no studies have investigated the impact of integrating these strategies into a test-and-treat H. pylori approach.  Led by Dr. Simona Kwon, the study goal of this full Research Project is to assess the efficacy, adoption, and impact of an integrated intervention to improve adherence to recommended stomach cancer prevention guidelines for at-risk, limited English proficient, low-income Chinese Americans in NYC. The integrated multifaceted theory-based intervention involves: 1) a health systems-level intervention using electronic health record (EHR)-based tools to facilitate H. pylori test-and-treat strategies; and 2) a theory-informed culturally and linguistically adapted CHW-led patient navigation program.  Using a two-arm randomized controlled trial design, we will enroll 144 Chinese American patients across NYC safety net hospital settings to achieve the following specific aims: 1) Collaboratively develop an EHR- based clinical decision support system and a CHW-led culturally and linguistically adapted stomach cancer prevention program to improve H. pylori eradication for the LEP, Chinese American patients; 2) Implement and assess the efficacy of a H. pylori test-and-treat EHR-CHW intervention; and 3) Use a mixed-methods approach and the RE-AIM evaluation framework to systematically assess the implementation process and delineate factors that influence feasibility, acceptability, adoption, sustainability, and scalability of a combined EHR-CHW strategy within safety net health care systems."
"9307098","Project Summary/Abstract Mutations in Cx46 (GJA3) and Cx50 (GJA8) cause cataracts in humans, and mice with targeted deletions of Cx46 and Cx50 also develop cataracts and microphthalmia, providing animals models for the human disease. This clearly shows that the lens needs gap junction channels, but does not address the types of molecules must pass through them to support normal lens growth and clarity. The dual whole cell patch clamp technique allows simultaneous determination of electrical connectivity (junctional conductance) and junctional flux for molecules such as second messengers introduced from the pipette of one cell. We have previously shown that knockout of Cx50, but not Cx43 or Cx46, results in smaller lenses due to a transient decrease in postnatal epithelial cell mitosis. This phenotype cannot be corrected by genetic substitution with Cx46, suggesting that loss of a single connexin species within a given tissue not only changes the total levels of communication, but also alters the kind of molecules being exchanged between the coupled cells. We hypothesize that homotypic Cx43, Cx46 and Cx50 channels will exhibit intrinsic differences in permeability to second messenger molecules like cAMP, IP3 and Ca . We further hypothesize that differences in permeability to second messengers are 2+ critical to the distinct functional roles of Cx43, Cx46 and Cx50 in vivo. We will determine the second messenger permeability of gap junction channels made from Cx43, Cx46 and Cx50 to Ca2+, inositol triphosphate (IP3) and cyclic nucleotides (cAMP). We will also map developmental differences in second messenger permeability through gap junction channels in genetically engineered mouse lenses. These studies seek to define how the diversity in connexin protein subunits influences intercellular communication in the lens, by contrasting the permeability of lens gap junction channels to second messenger molecules. These proposed studies have the potential to improve our understanding of the role of connexin channel permselectivity in lens development, and also as a potential contributor to disease states such as cataract."
"9348603","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Effective personal health information management (PHIM), including symptom monitoring, medication management and clinical care coordination, facilitates self-care, ensures appropriate use of health services, and improves health outcomes. Computer tools can assist with PHIM, but these solutions are often created with little attention to where they will be used. The visibility of a calendar for reminding one of a weekly blood test or the proximity of a Bluetooth-enabled glucometer to the computer that stores the readings can enable or interfere with PHIM. Designers must understand where PHIM occurs to make optimally effective solutions. Yet bringing designers and engineers into the private, personal spaces and allowing repeated, systematic study of home contexts is not only burdensome to the home dweller, but also infeasible due to the ever-changing nature of homes. The purpose of this project is to systematically determine how household context shapes personal health information management. Using Venkatesh's (1996) model of the five environments of health to explicate the environmental context in the SEIPS work system model, we will (1) undertake an extensive study of 20 households addressing the social, physical, psychological, technical and health services context of PHIM, including creating detailed photographic, video, and 3D reconstructions of these households in a virtual reality CAVE; (2) through recursive immersive exploration in the CAVE, enumerate the features of these households that shape PHIM; (3) enlist 20 people self-identified with diabetes in a requirements validation activity in the CAVE; (4) engage 60 people with diabetes in an experimental evaluation of these indicators and (5) use all of these results to develop and evaluate, in a field assessment of 200 households, an Assessment of the Context of Home Environments inventory. The reference set of 20 virtual homes will be distributed through Creative Commons for repeated studies by designers. We will also make available the Assessment of the Context of Home Environments (ACHE) protocol for rapid assessments of the home context. This interdisciplinary project brings together nurses, engineers, computer scientists, and health services researchers to explicate how the home context shapes health information needs and can be used to guide the design of consumer health information management solutions. As health care migrates from the institution to the home, and engagement of everyone in healthy practices is necessary to avoid disease or mitigate its consequences, systematic understanding of how homes will foster the integration of technologies into the every-day lives of people that ensure that homes not only become spaces for health but tools that draw people towards optimal well-being."
"9287734","More than a third of US Veterans who receive care through the VHA are obese, putting them at higher risk for multiple serious chronic health conditions including diabetes, cardiovascular disease, hypertension, and stroke. Losing even small amounts of weight can reduce the risks associated with those conditions. Lifestyle modification is the cornerstone of weight loss treatment. While efficacious lifestyle interventions for obesity exist, finding evidence-based programs that are scalable, cost-efficient, and serves a diverse VA population is a priority for the National Center for Health Promotion and Disease Prevention (NCP). In response, VA disseminated MOVE! Weight Management Program for Veterans (MOVE!) in 2006, a comprehensive, evidenced-based intervention that combines diet and physical activity counseling with behavior change strategies. MOVE! results in meaningful weight loss for those who actively engage in the program, but less than 5% of Veterans eligible for the program participate, and among those, few participate at a level that would result in meaningful weight loss. To address the growing burden that obesity places on Veterans and the health care system, VA now faces the challenge to improve access to comprehensive lifestyle interventions using a patient-centered and population-based approach. We aim to fill this gap by producing evidence on the effectiveness of a proven 12-month pragmatic DVD-based self-directed lifestyle intervention targeting modest, clinically meaningful weight loss and increased physical activity among obese Veterans. The curriculum, aimed at gradual weight loss through progressive healthful changes in diet quality and physical activity and behavioral skills training, is grounded in the Diabetes Prevention Program's (DPP) Group Lifestyle Balance (GLB) 12-session DVD. The program encourages supplementary goal setting and self-monitoring via the Heart360 website, and optional remote lifestyle coaching. We propose to leverage the VA's Corporate Data Warehouse to identify and enroll 500 obese Veterans. We will randomize participants to receive usual care or the lifestyle intervention. As primary outcomes, we will test whether, compared with usual care controls, intervention participants have better outcomes through 12 months of follow-up on weight loss and self-reported physical function. Secondary outcomes through 24 months include sustained weight loss, physical function, physical activity, sedentary behavior, diet quality, blood pressure, sleep quality, self-efficacy, and program reach. Dissemination work with NCP includes development of toolkits and budget impact analyses. We hypothesize that intervention participants will have more weight loss and improved physical function, as well as improvements in physical activity, sedentary behavior, diet quality, blood pressure, sleep quality, and self- efficacy."
"9333459","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Sleep plays a critical role in long-term memory consolidation, or the stabilization of recent memories over time.  In humans, non-rapid-eye-movement (NREM) sleep, compared to time spent awake, is associated with enhanced memory retention and the stabilization of memory representations across hippocampal-cortical networks.  Specific physiological mechanisms during post-encoding sleep are thought to support such memory stabilization:  slow wave activity or slow oscillations, which coordinate and synchronize large-scale neural activity during NREM sleep, and the reactivation of hippocampal activity patterns representative of prior experience (`reactivation') during wide-spread hippocampal-cortical network interactions.  A functional role of slow waves for the retention of recent memories has been shown in humans, and robust evidence for memory- related hippocampal reactivation and associated hippocampal network interactions has been shown during NREM sleep in rodents.  However, it is unclear from prior work 1):  which brain regions are critically necessary for the generation of slow waves that support successful NREM memory consolidation, with prior work indicating a predominance of slow wave density and origin over medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), and 2):  whether mechanisms of hippocampal reactivation and large-scale network interactions support human NREM memory consolidation, as little prior work has tested evidence for hippocampal reactivation and associated network interactions in the human brain.  By combining TMS with high-density EEG and EEG-fMRI measurements of NREM brain activity, this proposal seeks to remedy these gaps by 1):  testing the causal contribution of mPFC integrity to slow wave activity generation and associated NREM sleep memory consolidation, and by 2):  testing whether hippocampal-dependent learning results in robust evidence for hippocampal reactivation and large-scale network interactions during subsequent NREM sleep, and whether NREM hippocampal activity measures are functionally predictive of memory consolidation success (memory retention and neural stabilization across hippocampal-cortical networks).  In sum, this work aims to study the underlying brain regions and neural mechanisms that critically contribute to long-term memory retention during sleep in humans.  This proposal will improve our understanding of basic memory mechanisms that may underlie memory deficits in psychiatric and neurological disease states, which often express co-morbid impairments in memory and sleep abnormalities.  Moreover, this work will elucidate the functional significance of sleep loss associated with several neurological disorders and will aid in the successful development of therapeutics to ameliorate memory deficits by targeting modifiable aspects of sleep physiology."
"9278040","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Project 1 ? Understanding Recent Trends in Mortality and Morbidity The goal of this project is to understand the deterioration in health among middle-aged American men and women, especially among white non-Hispanics ? only recently brought to light. After three decades of decline, all-cause mortality rates for white non-Hispanics aged 45?54 have been on the rise since 1998. The increase has been driven by drug and alcohol poisonings, suicides, and cirrhosis and alcoholic liver disease. If white non-Hispanic mortality rates had continued to decline at 1.8 percent a year after 1998 ? the average rate of decline for whites in the previous two decades ? about 500,000 deaths would have been avoided through 2013, a number comparable to cumulative AIDS deaths in the U.S. There has been no corresponding change in the rate of mortality decline for non-Hispanic blacks or for Hispanics. In the same age group, morbidity among white non-Hispanics has increased for a range of measures, including self-reported physical and mental health, chronic pain, ability to conduct activities of daily living, including work, self-reports of heavy drinking, and clinically measured liver function. In contrast to the midlife group, mortality and morbidity have continued to improve for those aged 65 and above. The project will drill down into these overall statistics, disaggregating by location, by age, by sex, by occupational and educational groups, and by race and ethnicity, as well as by making comparisons with other wealthy countries. It will also attempt to understand the causes behind the decline in midlife health. There are two broad Specific Aims: (1) to build a public use database for the U.S. and for other rich countries that will be rich enough to document, for the U.S., the geographical distribution of midlife deaths and to link mortality and morbidity patterns, across space and time, to patterns of income, poverty, inequality, employment, unemployment, education and occupation and, internationally, to study the differences and similarities in mortality and morbidity patterns between the U.S. and other rich countries; and (2) to use the spatial and temporal ordering of those data to consider a range of hypotheses and possible determining factors, including (i) diminishing economic opportunity, especially for those with only a high school degree or less education, (ii) increases in pain and morbidity, before and after the marked increase in opioid availability, (iii) changes in occupational structure on reports of pain and other morbidity, and (iv) education itself, in conditioning mortality and morbidity independent of occupation and income. We will test whether hypotheses on economic prosperity, pain and other morbidity, increased availability of opioids, occupation, and education help to explain the differences between the US and other rich countries, and differences between racial and ethnic groups within the U.S."
"9423416","Preparation for End-of-Life Decision Making in Mild Alzheimer's Disease ABSTRACT Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a leading cause of death and affect over 5 million people in the U.S. AD cannot be effectively prevented or cured. For those with advanced AD, intensive or burdensome end-of-life care is common. Nearly 41% undergo at least one intensive intervention (e.g., tube feeding, mechanical ventilation) in the last 3 months of life, which may prolong life but not address quality of life or quality of dying. People in the early stages of AD are encouraged to engage in advance care planning (ACP) while they are still competent to appoint a surrogate decision maker and meaningfully participate in ACP discussions with the surrogate. Yet only a minority of older adults with early cognitive impairment engage in ACP following the diagnosis. A failure to engage in ACP before the window of opportunity closes (i.e. before loss of decision making capacity) has serious adverse consequences; family members are left to make decisions regarding care transition, tube feeding, and other life-sustaining treatment, often driven by a culture of technological imperative to deliver aggressive or futile medical care to very frail older adults. These family members experience considerable negative mental health sequelae after they face end-of-life decision making. To address these gaps, we will adapt and pilot test an efficacious ACP intervention, SPIRIT (Sharing Patient's Illness Representation to Increase Trust), with patients with mild AD and their surrogates (NIH Stage I behavioral intervention development) to promote open, honest discussions while such discussions about end-of-life care are possible. Our goal is to produce an effective and maximally implementable ACP intervention for patients with mild AD and their surrogates. Specific Aim 1 is to adapt SPIRIT (in person) to target patients with mild AD and their surrogates through a process of modification-pretesting-refinement using stakeholders (patients, family caregivers, and clinicians) and experts, including adapting the delivery mode to interactive web-based videoconferencing (SPIRIT-remote). Specific Aim 2 is, in a 3-group RCT with 120 patient-surrogate dyads, to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of SPIRIT in-person and SPIRIT-remote, and their preliminary efficacy compared to usual care on preparedness outcomes for end-of-life decision making (dyad congruence on goals of care, patient decisional conflict, and surrogate decision-making confidence) shortly after the intervention. We will also evaluate whether SPIRIT-in person and SPIRIT-remote result in an embodiment of the patient's wishes by 1 year post intervention, and interview a sample of surrogates at 1 year to assess the perceived impact of the intervention conditions (secondary aims). Preliminary efficacy data will be analyzed using mixed effects regression models. Qualitative analysis will use content and thematic techniques. This Stage I behavioral intervention development trial of SPIRIT will generate novel insights to fill the critical void of knowledge regarding how to improve ACP for people with mild AD who will progress to an advanced stage of the disease in the foreseeable future."
"9482649","Cognitive impairment (CI) and dementia are significant public health burdens that can have profound social and emotional effects on older adults. Early detection of CI is imperative in order to identify potentially treatable underlying causal conditions, and in cases where cure is not possible, to provide supportive services to minimize the effects of CI. While primary care and other clinical settings are ideal places for identifying CI, it frequently goes undetected. Available screening tools may be unsuitable for implementation in such settings because of their length, cost, or need for specialized equipment or highly trained administrators. Our project, MyCog: Rapid detection of cognitive impairment in everyday clinical settings, will create a brief, readily available, standard set of CI screening measures applicable for use in diverse settings and with diverse populations. Comprised of two cognitive measures drawn from the NIH Toolbox for Assessment of Neurological and Behavioral Function® and the Everyday Cognition self- and informant-report measures and implemented as a downloadable app, MyCog will be validated in a large sample of older adults (ages 65+) enrolled in ?LitCog III: Health Literacy and Cognitive Function among Older Adults?. Field testing MyCog within LitCog III will allow validation in multiple clinical workflows and in African-Americans, a health disparities population. Our proposed project will 1) Create a standalone MyCog App using existing NIHTB cognition tests and Everyday Cognition self-/proxy report measures that will report screening results as either ?No CI detected?, or `CI detected? and provide follow-up recommendations and guidelines for each outcome; 2) Validate MyCog (UH3 Phase) in primary care settings and determine its sensitivity in detecting early indicators of CI using an existing cohort (LitCog III) of well-characterized, ethnically and racially diverse adults ages 65- 85; 3) Evaluate the success of MyCog clinical implementation in primary care settings; 4) Optimize MyCog for use in clinical settings by adjusting scoring algorithms to maximize efficiency and incorporating features that facilitate clinical integration; and 5) if selected to do so, coordinate consortium-wide activities."
"9425213","ABSTRACT  Two of the concerns that have historically dominated discussions of the physician workforce in the US are the adequacy of the total supply of physicians and physicians' geographical distribution. While several articles have observed that the recent insurance expansion may increase demand for physician services and consequently amplify the concern of physician shortages, no study to date has systematically analyzed the potential influence of the expansion on physicians' geographical distribution. Gains in insurance coverage in recent years have been much larger in states that expanded Medicaid than in non-expansion states, thereby increasing demand for health care and creating more new earnings opportunities for physicians in expansion states. Further, within expansion states, earnings opportunities are likely to have expanded to the greatest degree in disadvantaged communities, where baseline rates of insurance coverage were lowest and gains in coverage greatest. Greater coverage gains in disadvantaged communities through the marketplace exchanges are likely to have contributed to the creation of new earnings opportunities in these communities as well. Taken together, these effects could, over time, attract more physicians to those communities that have historically been most deprived of them.  To our knowledge, the proposed project will be the first study to assess the effect of the insurance expansion on the practice location decisions of physicians in the US. Specifically, it will examine four Aims:  Aim 1. To assess the effect of the insurance expansion ? specifically, of the Medicaid expansion and the  growth in marketplace exchange coverage ? on new physicians' (i.e., physicians just finishing graduate  medical education) decisions regarding where to set up their first practices.  Aim 2. To assess whether the expansion disproportionately led more new physicians to set up their first  practices in disadvantaged communities, e.g., disadvantaged urban areas, small towns, and rural areas.  Aim 3. To assess whether new physicians who set up their first practices in disadvantaged communities  after the insurance expansion differed in education and qualifications (i.e., board certification, country, and  prestige of medical school) from new physicians who set up their first practices in other communities.  Aim 4. To assess the effect of the insurance expansion on established physicians' (i.e., physicians with  already established practices) decisions regarding whether and where to relocate their practices.  To examine the aims, we will analyze multiple large national data sets. Our empirical model of physicians' practice local choices will capture a wide range of attributes of physician market areas, including earnings opportunities, and permit us to simulate the effects of a variety of potential policy interventions. The study findings will have enormous relevance for health care policy over the next decade."
"9548476","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     A primary impairment associated with post-stroke hemiparesis is the failure to make rapid graded adjustment of muscle force (i.e. muscle power) within the context of purposeful complex synergies (e.g., coordination during walking). Not surprisingly, the impact of stroke on walking is significant, with less than 50% of survivors progressing to independent community ambulation. Even among those who achieve independent ambulation, significant residual deficits persist in balance and gait speed, with ~75% of persons post-stroke reporting limitations in mobility related to walking. Muscle weakness is the most prominent motor consequence among the nearly 6 million survivors of stroke living in the United States and the strongest predictor of functional disability in this large clinical cohort. To date, the physiological mechanisms that contribute to muscle dysfunction in hemiparetic subjects are largely unstudied. Moreover, evidence regarding the efficacy of interventions aimed at attenuating impaired muscle function and the ensuing functional consequences in the post-stroke population is equivocal and viable therapeutic options to remediate hemiparetic muscle weakness remain among the most pressing challenges for biomedical research. We propose that impaired muscle power (the product of muscle strength and velocity) generation is causal of functional (walking) disability post-stroke. In addition, coordination deficits are also critical determinants of functional performance. We have developed a comprehensive theoretical framework that defines and measures the factors underlying disordered muscle function and coordination and will apply this framework to Post-stroke Optimization of Walking using Explosive Resistance (POWER) training. Our goals over the four year funding period are to 1) quantify neural and muscular adaptations that contribute to impaired muscle power generation post-stroke; 2) assess effects of POWER training on neural and muscular adaptations in paretic and non-paretic muscle; and 3) determine the relationship between changes in neural and muscular adaptations following POWER training and locomotor improvements. Innovative aspects of the proposed work include the novel training intervention; the advanced magnetic resonance assessments; as well as the unique measure of the coordination that we propose. It is our belief that: a) neural and muscular adaptations following stroke are associated with impaired muscle power generation as well as locomotor ability, b) POWER training attenuates functional deficits by addressing the underlying neural and muscular elements and c) functional improvements following training are predicated on improving the most prominent neural and muscular contributors to muscle power generation. If correct, the data generated will provide an entirely new level of evidence regarding the effectiveness of this novel intervention strategy on improving functional performance as well as the importance of peripheral muscle properties as predictors of locomotor ability post-stroke."
"9361877","PROJECT ABSTRACT The general aim of this project is to exploit the international variation of health and life circumstances in Continental Europe to identify which interactions of bio-medical and socio-economic conditions over the life course affect cognition in later life. The project will leverage the EU-funding of the Survey of Health, Aging and Retirement in Europe (SHARE) and addresses a number of key research priorities for NIA: The study of older adults in a diverse array of countries will provide valuable information on cognitive status and relate it to the socio-economic and social environment of the elderly as well as biomarkers that may serve as instruments to target early prevention measures. It will enhance our understanding how the vastly differing social, health and long-term care systems affect mental health and resulting mortality of the aging populations. This holds especially for the life circumstances in Europe since World War II which are likely to have influenced cognitive decline now at older ages. Moreover, the large variation in key policy variables, e.g. retirement age, identifies pathways from early retirement through inactivity and loss of social contacts to lower cognition, mediated by education, working environment and other socio-economic factors over the life-course. SHARE is a large population-representative panel study closely modeled after the US Health and Retirement Study (HRS) in currently 27 Continental European countries plus Israel. Strictly harmonized health variables for the about 80,000 respondents include self-reported health, functional health, physical measurements such as grip strength, peak flow and chair stand, and a large battery of tests for cognition and mental health. Moreover, SHARE has collected dried blood spot samples from some 27,000 respondents. The project will fill two strategic gaps in the harmonization between HRS and SHARE. It will 1. Administer an in-depth measurement of cognition according to the Harmonized Cognitive Assessment  Protocol (HCAP) that has been developed for the HRS-style aging surveys supported by NIA. 2. Analyze the blood collected by SHARE for blood lipids and other biomarkers that have been found to  correlate with cognitive decline, vascular dementia and Alzheimer's disease. Using these data, the project will estimate prevalence rates of mild and severe cognitive impairment in the SHARE countries; compare these with HRS and other participants in the HCAP studies; and exploit the international variation of the SHARE plus SHARE-HCAP data in order to identify which interactions of biomedical and socioeconomic conditions over the life course affect cognition later in life. This project is synchronized with the long-run agenda of the SHARE panel which has collected blood in wave 6, is currently administering a life-history module in Wave 7 and will feature an extended cognition module in Wave 8. Funding is restricted to the additional data collection efforts for SHARE-HCAP and the analyses of blood taken in wave 6 and in the SHARE-HCAP substudy for markers associated with cognitive decline."
"9360766","PROJECT DESCRIPTION Visual recognition ability, an integral aspect of adult behavior, relies on cortical networks that selectively process ecological stimulus categories such as faces, places, and words. How these regions emerge through development, however, is largely a mystery. The goal of the proposed research is to pioneer the application of a novel MRI technology to measure the normative development of tissue properties within human visual cortex. This will significantly advance our limited understanding of the anatomical constraints to changes in neural function and visual recognition ability, and will additionally shed important insights into the organizational principles of high-level vision beyond striate cortex. The general approach to this project is as follows. (1) In subjects ranging in age from childhood (5-12 years) to adulthood (22-28 years), we will acquire both quantitative anatomical MRI and functional MRI, in addition to behavioral measures of visual perception and recognition ability. (2) In category-selective regions of ventral temporal cortex, we will relate developmental differences in the macromolecular make-up of a cortical region to differences in its functional selectivity. We will additionally relate macromolecular differences across development to behavior. (3) Lastly, we will validate the in vivo quantification of ventral temporal cortical tissue properties with human postmortem histology through the construction of a novel in-to-ex vivo pipeline. By measuring the normative development of visual cortex, and producing a dataset we plan on making available to other researchers, our proposed project addresses NEI's mission to conduct research into the mechanisms of visual function, which will be of great use to researchers and clinicians seeking to understand neurodegeneration and atypical brain development as well. The proposed work is integral to furthering the academic career of the candidate towards becoming an independent research professor at a major university and will promote diversity of the workforce in health-related sciences"
"9565800","Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) affects 12% of the US population and is associated with cardiovascular disease, reduced health-related quality of life (HR-QOL), increased all-cause mortality. However, nearly 80% of patients with OSA remain undiagnosed [QUALITY GAP #1]. Moreover, adequate adherence to continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy can improve HR-QOL and mood but the beneficial effects on cardiovascular outcomes are limited by poor CPAP adherence with nearly 54% of patients being non-adherent to CPAP therapy [QUALITY GAP #2]. The American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) released evidence- based clinical practice guidelines and quality metrics for the improved diagnosis and treatment of OSA, but these have not been implemented in underserved populations. The overarching aim of this proposal is to institute a multi-level strategy with interventions aimed at both providers and patients in order to improve guideline based care for OSA in populations with health disparities. Specifically, in order to address the under- diagnosis of OSA, we will implement an electronic health record (EHR) based predictive analytics system that is similar to recently implemented early warning system that triggers guideline-based treatment of sepsis in hospitalized patients. The proposed EHR-based alert with reflex order sets will enable primary care physicians (PCPs) to adopt the AASM guidelines for diagnosing OSA. In approximately 220,000 patients we have found that lower neighborhood income is associated with lower CPAP adherence. Considering the time and access- related barriers in the PCP office, we believe that such health disparities in CPAP adherence need to be addressed by culturally-competent peer educators with OSA serving as ?peer-buddies?. In a recent study we found that CPAP adherence can be improved by a peer-driven intervention through an interactive voice response system (PDI-IVR). Whether PDI-IVR can improve adherence in underserved populations in low resource clinics is unclear. Specific Aim #1: To test an EHR-based tool to alert primary care physicians of the potential for OSA in order to improve the diagnosis of OSA in low resource clinics. Specific Aim #2: To test a peer-driven intervention with interactive voice response (PDI-IVR) system to improve treatment adherence in populations with health disparities. Specific Aim #3: To evaluate the dissemination and implementation of a multi-level intervention strategy aimed at improving the diagnosis and treatment of OSA in populations with health disparities. We are proposing a RCT that recruits 102 providers, 362 patients, and 50 experienced peer-buddies in an underserved population with an excess burden of sleep disorders (Medicaid and dual- eligible Medicare beneficiaries in Pima county, Arizona) that is aimed at addressing the health disparities in the diagnosis and treatment of OSA. We will use a systems-level intervention (EHR-based tool) that targets providers and a patient-level educational intervention (PDI-IVR system) that targets patients in order to increase delivery of guideline-based care to populations with health disparities and promote health equity."
"9360007","Bone loss following spinal cord injury (SCI) is an important problem in the Veteran population. Bisphosphonates are currently the frontline therapy for postmenopausal osteoporosis, but do not restore bone in patients following SCI. Thus there is a need for new therapies. Bone loss following SCI results in part from disuse, but may also result from a variety of other mechanisms including the loss of blood supply to the bone. Ding et al. have shown in a mouse model, that SCI causes a dramatic loss of bone vascular volume. We propose a preclinical rat study to determine 1) whether reduced bone blood and reduced vascular volume play a role in bone loss following SCI and 2) whether bone loss can be prevented by administration of tetramethylpyrazine (TMP) alone or in combination with passive motorized bicycle training. Our proposed study is innovative because 1) we will study bone blood supply comprehensively (i.e. we will measure both blood flow and vascular volume), 2) we will determine whether bone blood supply is compromised before SCI-induced loss of bone mineral and 3) we will test strategies to prevent both loss of bone blood supply and loss of bone mineral following SCI. Our study has 2 specific aims.  Aim 1: Determine whether severe SCI causes early deficits in bone blood flow and bone vascularity and whether the time course of these changes precedes or matches that of cancellous bone loss. Hypothesis 1: SCI will cause significant loss of femoral blood flow (via in vivo microsphere administration) and femoral vascular volume (via micro CT of perfused vasculature) that will precede or accompany the reduced cancellous bone volume, reduced trabecular number, and increased osteoclast surface that we have previously reported to occur following SCI.  Aim 2: Determine whether SCI-induced deficits in bone blood flow, bone vascularity, and cancellous bone volume are prevented by TMP administration or by motorized bicycle training, alone or in combination. Hypothesis 2: Administration of TMP will prevent SCI-induced changes in vasculature and cancellous bone by protecting bone blood flow. Motorized bicycle exercise will also partially protect bone as we have previously observed. We predict that the greatest protection will occur in the group receiving combined TMP and bicycle straining.  Male Sprague-Dawley rats will receive a severe contusion injury vs. sham surgery. Over 4 weeks, we will assess bone blood flow in femurs by administration of microspheres to conscious rats via the femoral artery. We will also assess vascular volume in decalcified femurs of rats perfused with vascular microfil at the time of sacrifice. We will perform comprehensive analysis of cancellous bone morphology in distal femur, employing both micro CT and histomorphometry. In addition, fluorochromes will be administered to live animals to allow for histological assessment of osteoblast and osteoclast surfaces. We will administer multi- modal therapy (TMP with or without passive motorized bicycle training) to prevent bone loss following SCI. TMP is an herb-derived agent that is approved as a food additive and has been shown to protect bone following glucocorticoid administration. Our preliminary data shows that passive bicycle training partially protects bone following SCI."
"9444252","Project Summary The overall goal of this application is to understand how ion channels in T cells regulate immune responses to pulmonary infection with influenza virus. Influenza is major health risk and affect millions of patients in the US and worldwide. CD4 T cells play a critical role in supporting germinal center B cells to produce neutralizing antibodies against influenza virus and to become memory B cells, which together provide immunity against reinfection. The function of CD4 T cells is regulated by ion channels that mediate the influx of calcium and other ions. The calcium release-activated calcium (CRAC) channel, which is formed by ORAI1 proteins in the plasma membrane, is one of the best characterized channels in T cells. It mediates a specific and essential form of calcium influx, store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE), so called because it is triggered by the release of calcium from the endoplasmic reticulum. Ca2+ release activates stromal interaction molecule 1 (STIM1) and STIM2 and results in the opening of ORAI1 CRAC channels. Mutations in ORAI1 or STIM1 genes in human patients that abolish SOCE cause immunodeficiency with recurrent infections due to impaired T cell function and production of pathogen-specific antibodies. This defect is mimicked by STIM1/STIM2 double-deficient mice, whose CD4 T cells fail to develop into follicular T helper (TFH) cells and to help B cells mature into germinal center B cells after viral infection. We found that mice lacking STIM1/STIM2 in T cells cannot produce virus-specific antibodies upon infection with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) or vaccination with influenza virus. Important goals of this application are to understand whether CRAC channels in TFH cells control pulmonary immune responses to infection with influenza and to characterize the molecular mechanisms by which CRAC channels control the development and function of TFH cells in influenza. Besides the CRAC channel, about 600 ion channels and transporters are expressed in mammals, but to date only a few are established to contribute to T cell-mediated immune responses. We hypothesize that other ion channels besides the CRAC channel play important roles in regulating TFH cell-dependent humoral immunity to influenza. However, no studies have systematically addressed this question so far, which is a major gap in our knowledge of T cell physiology and adaptive immunity. We will address this gap and systematically screen for and characterize ion channels that regulate TFH cell-dependent humoral immune responses to influenza in vivo. The long-term goal of our study is to identify ion channels and downstream molecules they regulate that can be targeted therapeutically to enhance humoral immunity to influenza infection and vaccination. Since many ion channels are plasma membrane proteins, they are accessible to small molecule inhibitors or biologicals such as monoclonal antibodies to modulate their function and immune responses to influenza."
"9413805","PROJECT SUMMARY We propose a Core Center for Clinical Research at the Medical University of South Carolina entitled Improving Minority Health in Rheumatic Diseases (IMHRD, pronounced I aM HeaRD). Its mission is to advance knowledge with respect to the clinical care and health outcomes of African Americans who have, or who are at risk of developing, systemic lupus erythematosus, scleroderma and other debilitating rheumatic diseases, and thus improve their health. The center builds on a solid framework of strong leadership in Rheumatology, Biostatistics, Public Health Sciences and Health Disparities Research coupled with trust and a proven track record of recruitment of African American patients for clinical research, particularly during the past 4 years in the context of our NIAMS P60-supported MCRC on Rheumatic Diseases in African Americans. The new CCCR will retain and enhance the leadership and unique resources of the MCRC, including 3 cores: Administrative, Methodologic, and Clinical and Community Resource. We seek to impact minority health in rheumatic diseases by: a) providing well phenotyped research samples from minority lupus and scleroderma patients to an increasing pool of investigators at MUSC and elsewhere to define specific mechanisms of rheumatic disease pathogenesis and progression; b) enhancing use of the electronic health record to identify and recruit minority participants in clinical research projects; c) developing novel methodologic methods for clinical and translational studies as well as in studies of gene x gene and gene x environment interactions; and d) strengthening community engagement to enhance awareness of rheumatic diseases and health promotion and increase minority participation in clinical research. Our Center will offer unique resources and methodologies to other investigators and CCCRs. Specific aims are to: 1. Foster translational, clinical and outcomes research centered on African Americans with lupus and scleroderma; 2. Develop novel tools for using the electronic health record (EHR) to expand enrollment and simplify recruitment of participants in clinical research; 3. Serve as a specialized resource for providing information and education about these disorders to African American patients and families, their healthcare providers, the general public, investigators and other health professionals, other CCCRs and government agencies; 4. Provide well-characterized chronologic samples and associated clinical data to help investigators identify and understand underlying biologic reasons for differences in risk profiles; 5. Provide quantitative guidance to the CCCR Research Community while developing novel biostatistical methods and providing methodologic educational development of trainees and junior investigators; and 6. Provide a competitive pilot project program with methodologic support and mentoring for recipients. Special strengths of our center include outstanding institutional commitment, strong partnership with MUSC?s CTSA, a singular culture of trust with the community, and robust collaboration with the Lupus Foundation of America and DHHS Office of Minority Health."
"9351282","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Intellectual disabilities (ID) and autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are highly prevalent disorders of developmental delay with substantial overlap. ID and ASD are highly heritable, but because of genetic heterogeneity only about 15% of ASD patients and 50% of ID patients have a specific genetic diagnosis. Identified genetic causes of ASD and ID suggest common genetic pathways in disease pathogenesis including synaptic dysfunction, cytoskeletal dynamics in spine development, the Ras-MAPK pathway, and histone modification. In collaboration with two fellows in the laboratory of my sponsor, Christopher A. Walsh, I have recently identified a large family from the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates with recessively inherited ID with autistic features. We have identified a truncating mutation in a novel, uncharacterized gene in all affected individuals from this family. An unanswered question in developmental neurobiology is how the various cellular pathways that contain identified ASD and ID genes are coordinated in normal cognitive development. Understanding the function of this gene, a predicted methyltransferase that may regulate multiple genes through protein modification, can provide insight into coordination between cellular pathways for cognitive development disrupted in ASD and ID. I propose the following experiments to investigate the function of this gene. In Specific Aim 1, I will determine if the truncating mutation in this family is a loss of function allele, and will search for additional loss of function alleles in this gene in other ID and ASD patients. In Specific Aim 2, I will characterize subcellular localization, interaction partners, and methyltransferase activity of the protein encoded by this gene. In Specific Aim 3, I will collaborate with the lab of my co-sponsor, Michael Greenberg, to characterize neuron morphology and activity-dependent gene expression in the absence of this gene."
"9444169","Understanding the mechanisms that the nervous system uses to control movement is critical for understanding brain and behavior, and one of the fundamental questions in neuroscience. The control of movement emerges from the activity of different motor control centers, that converge onto output systems, mostly located in the spinal cord. While the spinal circuits that underlie different aspects of motor control have been relatively well characterized, the way by which these circuits are coordinated by supraspinal motor control centers remains elusive. In this project, we aim to understand the functional and computational logic of connectivity between a motor control centers, the motor cortex, and the spinal cord and muscle. We will anatomically and functionally characterize the role of projection-specific populations of corticospinal neurons during particular modes of motor control. Because even the simplest motor program requires the activation of many neuronal populations across multiple brain areas, we will also investigate the contribution of other cortical and subcortical areas to the output of the brain to the spinal cord, and to muscle activity. This understanding requires It also requires extracting the information that is carried between brain areas and neuronal cell types, and understanding the computations that are operated in the circuits in order to achieve specific patterns of muscle activation. We will extract computational principles governing the relation between brain activity and muscle activity that are conserved between rodents and  , and will construct predictive models of . In order to achieve a mechanistic understanding of the brain circuits underlying motor control, we will dissect the contributions of activity in specific neural populations using closed-loop optogenetic manipulations. The level of understanding that we are seeking requires a dynamic back and forth between anatomical and functional mapping experiments, computational and conceptual models, and causal testing of predictions. We put together a a multidisciplinary team of PIs working in a tight network, sharing the latest technologies to measure and manipulate the brain through an Advanced Imaging and Instrumentation core, creating and refining circuit models based on data that generate testable predictions, and establishing real-time knowledge exchange between team members through a Data Science Core. Our U19BCP Motor Control team proposes a comprehensive and ambitious project to establish the computational and circuit mechanisms underlying classical modes of motor control based on cell-type specific connectivity between brain and spinal cord, novel technology to measure and manipulate functionally and genetically-defined neural populations, and state-of-the-art computational tools. primates multi-area dynamics during motor control"
"9565805","Abstract The pulmonary vasculature is unique in that it is subjected to a remarkable change in hemodynamic forces immediately after birth. Increase in oxygen tension with the first breath results in decreased pulmonary vascular resistance, which in conjunction with closure of the ductus arteriosus and foramen ovale, leads to marked increase in the blood flow through the pulmonary blood vessels. While the majority of infants can respond to such a change in hemodynamic forces via vascular stabilization and maturation, those in whom complications occur can succumb to respiratory failure and death. Neonatal pulmonary hemorrhage (NPH) is such a complication occurring in about 1 in 1000 births. We hypothesize that failure of proper maturation of the pulmonary arteries, involving disruption of flow induced ERK5 activation, is a key mechanism of NPH. Currently NPH lacks any well-defined etiology and conventional therapy remains mainly supportive. We propose to test the hypothesis that excess production of the growth factor Angiopoietin 2 (ANGPT2) in the lung, which results from disrupted ERK5 signaling, is a key therapeutically targetable mechanism in infants with NPH. Using a combination of mouse genetic and pharmacologic models and in vitro studies, we propose to test the relevant role of the ERK5-ANGPT2 pathway in promoting stabilization of the pulmonary vasculature in the pivotal newborn period. Our ultimate goal will be to develop new therapeutic strategies for NPH, which may be applicable to other contexts of pulmonary vascular instability."
"9350431","Project Summary Mapping the spatiotemporal dynamics of proteins is a fundamental and critical challenge for understanding and addressing biomedical problems. Unfortunately, current tools cannot observe key structural motions, because they (1) require frozen, static samples, the dynamics of which are non-physiological; and/or (2) lack the necessary spatial resolution. Techniques such as NMR, x-ray crystallography and cryo-EM provide structural data without the time-ordering of the corresponding dynamics. Thus, these techniques cannot be applied to multi-step processes, such as drug binding. In contrast, single-molecule techniques follow individual proteins through these processes and, as a result, single-molecule Förster Resonance Energy Transfer (smFRET) has emerged as the state-of-the-art for observing protein dynamics. smFRET measures the ef?ciency of energy transfer between two dyes attached to key points on the protein structure. However, smFRET is limited to 3 nm spatial resolution, leaving nanoscale protein dynamics inaccessible. Consequently, a new, improved experimental tool is required. I propose to develop a new spectroscopic ruler that resolves dynamics with spatial resolution spanning nearly an order of magnitude (1-7 nm). Whereas smFRET measures the ef?ciency, I will measure the rate of energy transfer at the single-molecule level. To perform this mea- surement, I am developing a new technique, single-molecule Ultrafast Spectroscopy (smUS), by combining tools from two distinct ?elds, single-molecule biophysics and condensed-phase ultrafast spectroscopy. The signi?cant experimental challenges associated with both sets of tools require my unique background in these ?elds for successful implementation. By directly measuring the rate of energy transfer and using state-of-the-art theoretical frameworks to interpret the results, I introduce a new ability to probe conformational dynamics down to <1 nm. This technique is applicable to any protein, peptide, DNA or RNA that can be functionally labelled, and will be made broadly available to the research community. In my lab, we focus on receptor proteins. In 60% of drug delivery, receptor proteins bind ligands to initiate microscopic motions. Despite the importance of these motions, their dynamics are inaccessible with existing tools due to limitations in resolution, sensitivity, or experimental conditions. My proposed tech- nique resolves these motions with 1 nm spatial resolution and 10 ms temporal resolution to reveal the interplay between microscopic mechanisms and macroscopic function. This unprecedented resolution uniquely enables the study of therapeutic targets. Thus, we envision this approach uncovering the microscopic underpinnings of a broad range of biomedical problems."
"9538477","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): As the population continues to age, degenerative ocular diseases become increasingly common and create tremendous burden on the health care system. Vision impairment in the elderly with AMD takes away an average of 5 quality years of life. Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) represents a large market with ~2 million patients and another ~8 million people at risk in the U.S. alone. Approximately, 90% of the AMD patients have the dry form of the disease. There are no approved treatments for dry AMD and, thus it represents a potential high impact, targeted area in medicine. The potential market opportunity has been estimated to be up to $4 billion.  A pilot study lead by Drs. Merry and Dotson from The Toronto and Oak Ridge Study of Photobiomodulation (TORPA) looked at the effect of photobiomodulation (PBM) in the treatment of dry AMD. The TORPA data for dry AMD shows clinically and statistically significant improvement in visual acuity and contrast sensitivit, immediately after treatment for 6 weeks, demonstrating the potential use of PBM in dry- AMD. The prospective TORPA study combined multiple pre-selected monochromatic wavelengths to stimulate mitochondrial CCO function and suppress VEGF expression. The study conclusions were that LED treatment was a non-invasive, easily administered and safe treatment with no serious adverse events noted. More importantly, the study provides the only 1-year follow-up data of LED effectiveness in dry AMD. Some gradual loss of clinical benefit was seen in the follow-up to one year, suggesting the need to establish a maintenance dosing schedule and the desire to better understand the underlying cellular benefits. Nevertheless, these findings are the first to demonstrate a statistically significant clinical benefit (F(4,68) = 18.86, p < 0.0001) at p to 1 yr in dry AMD patients with PBM.  LumiThera was formed from founders with extensive clinical and developmental expertise in photobiomodulation to lead in the commercialization efforts. Multiple wavelength LED clinical and commercial instruments are being designed and built for an ophthalmologist office-based setting.  The current SBIR application will establish the cytoprotective effects of PBM in serially expanded human iPS cell-derived RPE cultures exposed to chronic oxidative stress under continuous wave (CW) (Specific Aim 1a) and pulsed wave (PW) (10 or 100 Hz, 20 and 30% duty cycle) (Specific Aim 1b) irradiation. Specific aim 2 will establish the magnitude of benefit of multiple LED wavelengths on cellular endpoints including retinal bioenergetics, oxidative stress, inflammation and Drusen components. Specific Aim 3 will establish the in vivo therapeutic benefits of PBM in three established mouse models manifesting an AMD-like phenotype. The results from these studies will provide for optimization of clinical dosing parameters and establish the mechanisms of action of PBM in the retina in vitro and in vivo. The findings will provide the basic safety and scientific foundation for a pivotl trial with a novel non-invasive, non-pharmaceutical therapy for dry-AMD."
"9447728","PROJECT SUMMARY R01GM105993 The goal of this renewal of R01-GM105993 is to determine the structure and dynamic properties of the complex between Ric-8A and the alpha subunit of the heterotrimeric G protein Gi (G?i1). Heterotrimeric G proteins modulate cell metabolism, secretion, electrical conductivity, gene transcription, cell division and cellular motility, and therefore are essential to eukaryotic life. Misregulation of G proteins is associated with cancer and a range of other diseases of relevance to general medicine. While most processes controlled by heterotrimeric G proteins occur at cell membranes, recent research has shown that G alpha subunits (G?) also control certain events in the cell cytoplasm. Important among these is asymmetric cell division, which is essential for embryonic development. Ric-8A is critical regulator of G? in this process. Ric-8A is a Guanine nucleotide Exchange Factor (GEF) that activates G? by catalyzing the exchange of guanosine diphosphate (GDP) for guanosine triphosphate (GTP) at the active site of G?. The intermediate in this reaction is the nucleotide-free G?:Ric-8A complex. Describing the structural changes that occur when Ric-8A binds to G?·GDP is key to understanding how Ric-8A activates G?. Ric-8A is also a chaperone that promotes proper folding of G? in cells. The two aims of this proposal will test the hypothesis that G?i1 and possibly Ric-8A sample multiple conformational states in the complex G?i1:Ric-8A and to make use of structural information to ask whether the GEF and chaperone activities are mechanistically inseparable, or are distinct functions that can be decoupled. The mechanism by which Ric-8A is regulated by protein kinase CK2 will also be investigated. Aim 1 is to determine the structure of Ric-8A and its complex with G?i1 by X-ray crystallography, with the former in both phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated states. Camelid single chain heavy chain variable domains will be used as crystallization adjuvants. Collaborative heteronuclear NMR experiments will be conducted as an independent approach to define the interface between Ric-8A and G?I and to identify residues in transition among conformational states. Assays of GEF and chaperone activities will be conducted to assess the role of residues that are hypothesized from structural studies as mediators of one or both of these activities. Aim 2 will determine the global structure of Ric-8A:G?i1 using small angle X-ray scattering and cryo-electron microscopy. Modeling of the lower resolution structures using molecular dynamics and Monte Carlo simulations with X-ray structures of Ric-8A and G?i1 will be used to detect and identify multiple conformational states of the complex."
"9445620","Abstract  Understanding whether and how robust clinical evidence is integrated into practice is critical from the perspectives of: a) improving patient safety and health outcomes; b) designing programs and policies to accelerate the use of high value, effective treatments and abandon less effective and harmful treatments; c) containing health care costs by allocating limited health care budgets to their most effective use. In most circumstances, physicians and health care delivery organizations (HCDOs) are the key agents in determining whether a patient receives a given medical treatment. However, physician and HCDO integration of clinical evidence into practice is not well studied or understood. In general, the term ?integration of evidence into practice?, could mean both the adoption of new treatments and de-implementation of established treatments based on new evidence related to effectiveness or safety. In this proposal, we will focus on the latter. Our primary focus is to understand how physician networks, HCDOs and physician market environment influence the de-implementation of ineffective and unsafe treatments in practice. As such, we have the following aims: Aim 1: To describe variation in the de-implementation of ineffective and unsafe treatments across physicians and HCDOs. Aim 2: To investigate how characteristics of the physician (i.e. age, gender, years since medical school or residency, patient-mix), HCDO (i.e. practice size, specialty mix, ownership, level of integration), physician's patient sharing network (i.e. betweenness centrality), and physician's market environment (competition, malpractice environment) influence de-implementation of ineffective and unsafe treatments by physicians. Aim 3: To assess the influence of de-implementation of ineffective or unsafe treatments in the physicians' network (defined by HCDO affiliation and patient-sharing) on physicians' likelihood to de-implement ineffective and unsafe treatments.  We will focus on different case studies concerning treatments with implications for cardiovascular outcomes and safety. Our study sample will include the Medicare Fee-For Service (FFS) population (from CMS) as well as the commercially insured and Medicare Advantage (MA) populations (OptumLabs)."
"9348609","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Patients with heart failure experience four million hospitalizations per year in the United States. Of these hospitalizations, approximately three-quarters, or three million hospitalizations annually, are for causes other than heart failure. Patients with heart failure who are hospitalized for other causes are at high risk of post- discharge mortality possibly in part because they are less likely to receive guideline recommended care than patients who are hospitalized primarily for heart failure. Health information technology (HIT) has the potential to improve patient care by enhancing clinician compliance with evidence-based guidelines. Specifically, clinical decision support systems (CDSS) have been used to improve care for patients in hospitals, including those hospitalized for heart failure. Despite their utility, CDSSs have not been developed to apply more broadly to patients with heart failure who are hospitalized for other causes. This is clearly a gap for the millions of patients with heart failure who might experience improved outcomes if they were to receive guideline recommended care. The purpose of this study is to develop and test a CDSS for hospitalized patients who have heart failure, regardless of reason for hospitalization. The firt aim is to develop an Electronic Health Record (EHR) based algorithm to identify patients with heart failure using a variety of computational techniques including natural language processing. The second aim is to develop a CDSS to support delivery of guideline recommended care to hospitalized patients with heart failure using human computer interaction techniques. The third aim is to implement and test the effectiveness of the CDSS on processes of care for patients with heart failure who are hospitalized for other causes. The central hypothesis is that this decision support system will increase adherence to guideline recommended care, ideally improving outcomes as a result. The candidate, Saul Blecker, MD, MHS, is a general internist and clinician investigator at NYU School of Medicine. The candidate proposes a program of career development and training to achieve the following objectives: 1) develop expertise in medical informatics; 2) gain skills in human computer interaction; 3) develop expertise in implementation research. The candidate's primary mentor, Stuart Katz, MD, MS, is a seasoned mentor and researcher in heart failure. His co-mentor is Gilad Kuperman, MD, PhD, a leader in health information technology and medical informatics. Donna Shelley, MD, MPH, an expert in implementation and effectiveness research, will serve as an additional co-mentor. This mentorship team will work closely together to guide Dr. Blecker toward his research goal of leveraging HIT to improve the quality care for patients with heart failure."
"9377498","Project Summary/Abstract  The goal of this project is to develop a unified, asymmetric route to several akuammiline alkaloids. The akuammiline alkaloids are a family of indole alkaloids that have garnered attention from the synthetic community for both their complex structures and their intriguing biological activities. Members of the family have been shown to hold potential for treating cancer, pain, inflammation, diabetes, depression, and herpes simplex virus.  The proposed routes should allow access to a variety of the core structures of the akuammilines, through the exploration of challenging synthetic transformations. I expect to accomplish the synthetic studies via the completion of two aims. First, I will use the unified route to access both (?)-picrinine and (?)-11-methoxyvincorine. The former of these should be accessible using a challenging, late stage oxidation. Following the synthesis of (?)-picrinine, I will explore and optimize an unusual structural rearrangement from (?)-picrinine to allow access to (?)-11-methoxyvincorine. With flexible access to those two natural products, I then propose to broaden the scope of the Fischer indolization methodology by using it to access compounds with vicinal quaternary centers. The introduction of vicinal quaternary stereocenters remains a formidable challenge in chemical synthesis. With that methodology in hand, I will use it to complete the first total synthesis of (?)-picraline, a compound which has derivatives that show promise for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. Finally, I propose to use this methodology to access (?)-(?)-akuammigine, arguably the most complex akuammiline alkaloid isolated to date. Additionally, all compounds made during the course of my research will be submitted for biological testing."
"9302284","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Rare epilepsies are a devastating group of diseases that begin in childhood, and often cause profound neurologic, medical, and psychiatric disabilities. There are reliable epidemiologic estimates for only a few of these diseases. Tuberous sclerosis (TS), for example, affects 1 neonate per 5700 live births. However, for some diseases like Aicardi syndrome, estimates are limited to counts of known cases (900 in the US). And for others, such as MERRF (Myoclonic Epilepsy with Ragged Red Fibers), there are no estimates at all.  Several obstacles have impeded surveillance and epidemiology of this vulnerable and medically complex population. First, identifying individuals in large datasets is difficult. Although some diseases have specific billing codes (i.e. ICD-9 759.5 TS + 345.x epilepsy = TS with epilepsy), most are coded with nonspecific diagnoses like 345.9 (epilepsy unspecified) or 780.39 (other convulsions). Second, although caregivers have formed advocacy groups for individual rare epilepsies, these groups only recently united to support research. Third, many individuals seek care at multiple centers, preventing a full assessment of their history from clinical data at a single center.  There are new opportunities to study these diseases. First, broad use of electronic health records (EHRs) now allows researchers to analyze large volumes of clinical notes with text processing tools. A regular expression, for example, is a robust, easy-to-share technique to specify a text search. Second, the Rare Epilepsy Network (REN) has unified advocacy groups for rare epilepsies into a federally funded research consortium. Third, multi-institutional clinical data research networks such as the New York City Clinical Data Research Network (NYC-CDRN) are gathering medical records from multiple institutions.  The central idea of our proposal is that text processing of clinical notes ill improve surveillance and epidemiology of the rare epilepsies. We will use the NYC-CDRN to identify affected individuals using EHRs from multiple academic medical centers. We will describe the incidence, prevalence, comorbidities, mortality, and quality of ambulatory care for these individuals. Finally, we will develop, characterize, and disseminate specifications for searching text (a set of regular expressions) to find affected individuals in clinical notes.  Improved epidemiological estimates will guide clinical care, prioritize research initiatives, spur development of therapies by industry, and help caregivers understand these devastating diseases. The text searching specifications (regular expressions) will help centers identify rare  epilepsies to support surveillance, research, quality improvement, care management, and referral to advocacy organizations. This work aligns with recent Institute of Medicine (IOM) recommendations (1, 2, 4, 8, 9, 13) and with the 2014 National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) Epilepsy Benchmarks (IC, IIC, IIF, and IVD)."
"9470585","Project Summary  The goal of the proposed work is to develop a robust hybrid neural-machine interface (NMI), combining brain and muscle signals, to improve overall control of a lower limb prosthetic device during activities of daily living. Limb amputation affects over 600,000 individuals annually in the US, and is a major cause of physical disability that causes activities of daily living to become difficult or impossible for the amputee. The limitations of current lower-limb prostheses are associated with limited volitional control, reduced mobility, and chronic gait abnormalities, which have been linked to exhaustion from increased energy expenditure, increased risk of falling, and degenerative bone and joint disorders in both the intact and amputated limb. In this study, EMG signals from both residual and intact lower limbs and EEG signals from the cortex are leveraged to decode transitions to and from various modes of locomotion modes in able-bodied individuals and transfemoral amputees, and to provide a global understanding of movement at the cortical, muscular, and kinematic level in amputees. Specifically, time and frequency domain features are leveraged to create a prediction algorithm capable of identifying upcoming terrain transitions in advance. In lower limb amputees, this hybrid NMI paradigm translates to volitional control of a powered lower-limb prosthesis, which allows for seamless transitions between various movement conditions. The high-level of control is expected to result in significant increases in level of activity and overall improvements in gait. Previous studies have demonstrated the feasibility of EEG or EMG based NMIs for orthotic and prosthetic devices; however, no study to date has integrated EEG and EMG in a NMI for powered lower limb prostheses. This study is motivated by the need to explore advanced neural control sources for intuitive control of artificial limbs.  This project aligns directly with the Mission & Goals of the NIH, the Brain Initiative, and NIH?s Blueprint Program by expanding fundamental knowledge of neuroscience, human, health and wellness; by utilizing an innovative research strategy; and ultimately returning the knowledge to the public through the development of a highly advanced medical technology. Furthermore, the technology developed through this work has implications beyond the amputee population in the treatment of many neurological conditions and injuries, such as in neurorehabilitation after stroke. The innovation of this project lies in the novel approach of using multimodal neural signals and movement synergies as a framework for interpreting movement of the lower limb. The scientific impact is realized by a greater understanding of the neural correlates of movement after lower-limb amputation. The direct clinical significance for the patient can be measured directly through improved gait performance and walking confidence, leading to increased mobility and a reduced risk of falling, exhaustion, and bone and joint disorders."
"9391616","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):      Project Background/Rationale. Progressive cognitive impairment leading to dementia is an important component of Parkinson's disease (PD), contributing to significant levels of disability. The number of veterans who will develop PD and, in turn, the number of veterans with PD who develop dementia is likely to increase substantially. Given the profound negative health and social consequences associated with the development of dementia, it is critical to identify interventions that effectively slow the decline of cognitive function to prolong the time to onset f dementia. Based on the results of prior studies, physical activity is one of the few nonpharmacological interventions that holds promise in slowing cognitive decline. Project Objectives. We propose to build on our experience with objective, physiologically-based measurements of physical activity in randomized, controlled trials (RCTs), to conduct an RCT of a home-based physical activity intervention program among patients with mild cognitive impairment in PD (PD-MCI) - a group at high risk of experiencing further cognitive decline and most likely to benefit from physical exercise. We hypothesize that patients with PD-MCI in the intervention arm will have less cognitive decline compared with those in the control arm. Project Methods. Community-dwelling veterans with PD-MCI will be randomized either to a smartphone-based physical activity intervention to promote brisk walking or a health education control intervention. We will test the effects of the walking intervention over 6 months for the primary outcome of Alzheimer Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale and for the three secondary outcomes of Stroop Test, Verbal Fluency Test, and California Verbal Learning Test. Furthermore, we will test for the durability of these effects with a tapered physical activity dosage through 18 months of follow-up. Information derived from this study could be easily incorporated into clinical practice guidelines and disseminated widely at relatively low cost withi the VA Healthcare system and beyond."
"9358715","PROJECT SUMMARY To date, the lack of focus on children in the health care quality movement has been notable. Quality gaps in many areas of pediatric health care delivery have been identified; however, for almost all such conditions, appropriate pediatric quality measures have not been available. In response to the call for proposals for the Cooperative Research Demonstration and Dissemination Projects, we present the Q-METRIC Implementation and Quality Improvement project to test and implement 6 measures in 3 distinct measure sets. Each set is focused on a significant issue in the care of children: sickle cell disease, overuse of imaging for headaches and seizures, and outpatient care of asthma. Collectively, these measures offer great potential for improving pediatric health care quality. All were developed and tested by the Q-METRIC team during the initial Pediatric Quality Measure Program (PQMP) grant period, using a rigorous and validated process. Nearly all of these measures have been submitted and approved for inclusion in the National Quality Measure Clearinghouse (NQMC), and one measure has been endorsed by the National Quality Forum and recommended for inclusion in the Medicaid Core Measure Set. Importantly, the selected measures are all claims-based and do not require costly and time-intensive chart review; this makes them easier to implement and use. The Q-METRIC Implementation and Quality Improvement team consists of investigators from the Child Health Evaluation and Research Unit at the University of Michigan, 2 State Medicaid programs, 3 health plans, 3 health systems, 1 clinical consortium, and several national leaders in measurement and improvement, who populate our expert advisory committees. The partnerships developed for this project will bring remarkable innovation to the dissemination and implementation of the quality measures through (1) our capacity to create synergy across a wide range of methodologic, analytic, and measurement testing scenarios, and (2) the opportunity to develop multiple quality improvement (QI) interventions for implementation across state, health plan, and health system levels. This approach will focus on the key goals of assessing the feasibility and useability of these newly developed measures at the three identified levels. Project efforts will be organized around the development of two teams. Each team will address specific components of the two key goals stated in the FOA: Team A: field testing, refinement, data collection, and reporting on the new measures, and Team B: use of performance data from the measures to define QI goals and test multilevel improvement strategies. These 2 teams will be organized to work both in parallel and in tandem to accomplish project goals. We will focus on the following objectives: 1) continued appraisal of regular performance scores and reliability assessments of these measures, at the state level; 2) field testing to ensure scientific acceptability at the health plan and health system level, followed by appraisal of regular performance scores at these levels; and 3) exploration of the feasibility of specification as e-measures."
"9335355","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Lysine acylation has emerged as a prominent post-translational modification (PTM) within mitochondrial proteins. Increased susceptibility of mitochondrial proteins to acylation is a function of the alkaline pH of the matrix, in conjunction with the relatively high concentration of acyl-CoA intermediates. Protein acylation varies as a function of the matrix acyl-CoA pool and is counterbalanced by the activity of various mitochondrial- localized deacylases (SIRT3, 4, 5). As such, metabolic conditions know to increase free acyl-CoAs (e.g., high- fat diet, caloric restriction), as well as genetic knockout of either SIRT3 or SIRT5 have revealed a wide range of acetyl and acyl (e.g., malonylation, succinylation, glutarylation) modifications throughout various mitochondrial proteins. Although in some cases lysine acylation has been linked to altered enzymatic flux (e.g., lysine acetylation inhibits is citrate dehydrogenase), the functional relevance of these modifications in the context of mitochondrial physiology and disease is largely unknown. Malonyl-CoA decarboxylase (MCD) is an enzyme responsible for the degradation of malonyl-CoA, and genetic ablation of the enzyme in MCD-/- mice results in elevated tissue levels of malonyl-CoA. Our preliminary studies show that MCD in muscle and liver is predominantly localized to the mitochondria. Moreover, Western blot assessment of global malonylation in MCD-/- mice revealed striking elevations in malonylated proteins, particularly in the mitochondrial compartment. Follow up experiments using LC mass spectrometry (MS)/MS revealed widespread hypermalonylation in skeletal muscle tissue of muscle-specific MCD deficient mice (MCDMCK-/-). Included among identified targets of malonylation were two of the three subunits of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC), as well as enzymes involved in beta-oxidation, ATP synthesis, the TCA cycle and redox homeostasis. Thus, the current NRSA application will test the overarching hypothesis that MCD defends mitochondrial function in muscle and liver by protecting against hypermalonylation of matrix proteins. In Aim 1 we will identify malonylated lysine residues in both skeletal muscle and liver of tissue specific MCD deficient mice under low fat and high fat fed conditions and then compare these sites with those previously reported for SIRT5-/- mice. In Aim 2 we will focus on hits identified in preliminary studies and SA1 to determine if the hypermalonylation phenotype of the MCD deficient mice is accompanied by alternations in mitochondrial function (e.g., enzyme activities, respiratory kinetics and H2O2 emission/redox homeostasis). Lastly, in Aim 3 we will use a variety of pharmacological and genetic approaches to alter protein malonylation, coupled with targeted LC-MS(MS), to test the hypothesis that protein malonylation exists as a novel regulator of the PDC. Results could implicate lysine acylation as a cause of mitochondrial failure in the context of aging and/or chronic metabolic disorders."
"9378826","Overall Project Summary / Abstract Now in its 17th year of operation, Dana-Farber/Harvard Cancer Center (DF/HCC) was the first consortium model, NCI-designated Comprehensive Cancer Center in the country. The consortium is comprised of 1,100 members from five principal Harvard-affiliated hospitals and two Harvard health science schools: Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (BIDMC), Boston Children's Hospital (BCH, Brigham and Women's Hospital (BWH), Dana-Farber Cancer Institute (DFCI), Harvard Medical School (HMS), Harvard T. H. Chan School of Public Health (HSPH), and Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH). The progress presented in this proposal has required DF/HCC leadership, its combined resources, and, most importantly, its consortium structure. The overarching scientific vision is to unite the members. The research of the Center is carried out in Research Programs that cross both scientific and institutional boundaries. In addition, the Center supports Shared Resources dedicated to enhancing scientific efficiency available to all Center members. The unified clinical research infrastructure has made it easier for members to conduct clinical trials across the Center. Indirect indications of scientific progress are the substantial growth in the Center's grant portfolio, from $233 million in 1999 to $406 million in 2004, to $623 million in 2009, to $683M and the award of multiple translational grants that transcend organizational boundaries (e.g., SPOREs, SCORs, P01s, U01s, and SU2Cs). There is also an array of hypothesis-driven, Early Phase (pilot, I, I-II), and proof-of-concept trials, made possible through the development and execution of the Center, that are conducted daily across the consortium."
"9564334","Mitochondrial dysfunction causes neurodegenerative diseases. Energy deficiency concomitant with increased free radical production is responsible for cell death in many of the early-onset mitochondrial disorders. It is now increasingly appreciated that mitochondrial dysfunction also plays an important role in adult- and late-onset neurodegenerative diseases. However, a role of bioenergetic deficit as the primary cause of these diseases is less compelling. The mitochondrial processes affected in the degenerative diseases are often not directly involved in oxidative phosphorylation, which include protein quality control, organellar dynamics, mitophagy and stress signaling among others. Protein quality control on the inner membrane of mitochondria (IMM) is dependent on a group of highly conserved proteases, including the m-AAA protease, the presenilin-associated rhomboid-like protease (PARL), the HTRA2 protease (PARK13) and the IMMP2 processing peptidase. Defects in these proteases cause neurodegenerative diseases such as spinocerebellar ataxia, spastic ataxia-neuropathy syndrome, spastic paraplegia and Parkinson's disease. The pathogenic mechanisms underlying these diseases are unclear. Two pertinent questions are still outstanding: (1) is protein misfolding and proteostatic stress on the IMM the primary cause of neurodegeneration? and (2) if so, how does it induce neuronal cell death? The multifunctionality of the protein quality control proteases prevented their utility for testing potential non-bioenergetic roles of these enzymes in neuronal survival. To overcome this obstacle, we recently generated a mouse model that expresses a misfolded and pathogenic variant of the adenine nucleotide translocase 1 (Ant1) on the IMM. Our preliminary studies showed that the misfolded Ant1 accumulates specifically in the central nervous system, which induces an ascending paralytic phenotype. We also showed that introduction of similar mutations in yeast induce cell death by a novel mechanism that we named mitochondrial Precursor Over-accumulation Stress (mPOS). mPOS is characterized by the toxic accumulation of mitochondrial precursor proteins in the cytosol. Thus, clinically relevant mitochondrial damage is sufficient to induce proteostatic stress in the cytosol. In this grant application, we will test the hypothesis that mPOS plays a role in neurodegeneration. In Specific Aim 1, we will test the hypothesis that proteostatic stress on the IMM induces selective cell death in the central nervous system particularly in the lower regions of the spinal cord. In Specific Aim 2, we will test the hypothesis that proteostatic stress on the IMM induces mPOS, which contributes to neurodegeneration. Success of the project will help our understanding of many neurodegenerative diseases induced by proteostatic stress on the IMM. It may also have implications for motor neuron diseases (e.g., ALS and hereditary spastic paraplegia), in which the contribution of mitochondrial dysfunction to the pathogenesis is poorly defined."
"9271013","1. OVERALL ABSTRACT This is a new submission to establish the ?ChicAgo Center for Health and EnvironmenT (CACHET)? ? the first NIH P30 Environmental Health Sciences Core Center in the Chicago area and a partnership between the University of Chicago (UofC) ? a leading private university in the nation and the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC) ? the leading public university in Illinois. CACHET will be comprised of 69 members from 18 Departments across 7 colleges/institutes at the two complementary partner Universities. CACHET will promote synergistic, multidisciplinary environmental health research between the clinician, laboratory and population scientists to evaluate, delineate and ultimately reduce environmental health related disparities among residents of Chicago and beyond. The need for a dedicated environmental health research center in Chicago is highlighted by a disproportionate racial/ethnic health imbalance observed for multiple diseases and outcomes. In this context, the CACHET mission is to ?elucidate the biological, social and economic underpinnings between relevant urban environmental exposures and human disease and translate the findings to reduce health inequities within our communities.? As such, our overarching theme is ?Mitigating Disparities in Environmental Health.? To accomplish our mission, CACHET will organize five multidisciplinary focus groups: Air, Water & Soil Pollution- to address diseases related to poor air, soil and/or water quality; Biomarkers of Exposure, Susceptibility and Risk- to elucidate how environmental exposures confer risk for disease due to individual genetic and epigenetic differences; Environmental Carcinogenesis- to elucidate specific mechanisms of environmental effectors that promote cancer; Endocrine and Metabolic Diseases- to determine how environmental exposures act at windows of susceptibility to drive disequilibrium in endocrine and metabolic homeostasis; and Economic and Social Determinants of Environmental Effects and Policy- such that the economic impacts and social factors are considered in assessing exposure mitigation and informing policy. This structure will permit the development of integrated research themes that cut across focus groups, with a particular emphasis on urban issues and racial/ethnic health imbalances. CACHET multidisciplinary research will be supported through four facility cores that will leverage the expertise and facilities from the two institutions. This includes the required Community Outreach and Engagement Core (COEC) and Integrated Health Sciences Facility Core (IHSFC) combined with the Biomarkers Core (BC) and the Statistics & Modeling Facility Core (SMFC) created in response to the research needs of CACHET investigators. CACHET will build capacity in EHS by funding pilot projects and promoting career development in environmental research. Overall, research orchestrated by CACHET will inform the decisions of policy makers and reduce health disparities in Chicago and beyond."
"9448357","Abstract. Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is an important human pathogen that exerts a tremendous negative impact on human health. S. aureus stands out among other species of Coagulase- Negative Staphylococci (CoNS) in that S. aureus specifically has evolved high pathogenic potential. Some of this is explained by the arsenal of virulence traits present in the genomes of MRSA isolates. However, the metabolic evolution of S. aureus contributes equally to the success of this pathogen. That is, S. aureus has evolved to thrive at sites if inflammation, which are very often hypoxic, replete with immune radicals (e.g. nitric oxide, NO·) and devoid of free iron. All these attributes limit bacterial respiration and S. aureus has evolved to better deal with such respiratory stress than most CoNS. In response to respiratory stress, S. aureus elicits a metabolic state that maximizes glycolytic flux coupled to lactate excretion. This Warburg-like metabolism is reminiscent of that employed by host immune cells infiltrating to sites if infection. Thus, S. aureus must compete with the host for available glucose. As such, S. aureus encodes three glucose-specific transporters not present in most CoNS. Moreover, S. aureus encodes a unique lactate dehydrogenase (Ldh1) that supports redox balance in the absence of respiration. Our LC-MS metabolomics survey of S. aureus under respiratory stress has uncovered many new pathways beyond lactate production that contribute to redox balance. Aim 1 of this proposal seeks to identify the genes that encode the enzymes in these pathways as none have been annotated. We hypothesize that many of these genes share a common regulatory mechanism and are not encoded in the genomes of most CoNS. Thus, these newly acquired metabolic genes represent additional examples of the metabolic evolution that allowed for the emergence of a pathogen from a genus of skin commensals. We will also explore whether the certain genes exhibit signatures of forward selection specifically among NO·-resistant staphylococci possibly highlighting new mechanisms of metabolic evolution. The second Aim focuses on uncovering the mechanism by which all of these newly acquired metabolic genes, and major virulence regulons (Agr) are controlled by the presence of glucose. We contend that S. aureus uses glucose as a signal that it has penetrated into deeper tissue given that carbohydrates are scarce on the skin surface. Coordinating the expression of virulence genes as well as metabolic genes that contribute to growth in inflamed tissue with the availability of glucose underscores the importance of this carbon source to the metabolic evolution of S. aureus. As such, the final aim investigates whether excessive blood glucose in diabetic patients drives MRSA virulence factor production thereby worsening infection. In total, this proposal seeks to finalize our understanding of the metabolic evolution of an important human pathogen and how it is intricately tied to blood glucose. Perhaps the rise in metabolic disorder in the US accounts for more of the rise in MRSA incidence over the last several decades that previously appreciated."
"9516413","PROJECT SUMMARY  With the impending dementia epidemic, studies have attempted to demonstrate the potential to improve older adults' cognitive ability via cognitive training and activity interventions. However, results are inconsistent, and it is possible that potential benefits of an intervention may be missed due to a lack of sensitivity in the cog- nitive outcomes. Rather than implementing new interventions with modified techniques, there is a critical need to identify measures that are most sensitive to cognitive plasticity in current lifestyle interventions of aging. One promising approach is intraindividual variability (IIV) in cognitive speed, or moment-to-moment changes in a person's performance across multiple trials of a reaction time (RT) task. IIV is a stable individual characteristic that represents fluctuations in attention or executive control, and provides information beyond mean RT. IIV is maladaptive, as greater variability is associated with poorer cognitive performance, neurologi- cal disease, and poorer neurological functioning. IIV in cognitive speed in adulthood is hypothesized to be a sensitive behavioral indicator of neurological integrity, where greater IIV is indicative of compromised integrity, as has been shown to predict outcomes such as dementia and death. IIV is modifiable however, as short-term reductions in IIV have been found after attention-based feedback. Reduction in IIV via an intervention would demonstrate both cognitive and neurological plasticity. Overall, IIV is capable of detecting even modest changes in functioning that are not evaluated by typical cognitive tests, and represents a unique measure to evaluate cognitive change and provide information about underlying brain health in lifestyle interventions.  The proposed project will examine if change in IIV occurred as a result of lifestyle interventions amongst older adults, and compare if there are differences in which intervention modalities elicit IIV change. Secondary data analyses will be conducted on datasets from three rigorous NIH-funded randomized control trials that asked older adults to participate in intensive physical, social, and cognitive activity. Participants in the treat- ment conditions are expected to show a reduction in IIV, representing an improvement in neurological function- ing, compared to the corresponding control groups. Investigation of intervention datasets that focused on differ- ent activity domains will also provide information regarding which activity domain(s) are critical to prompt cogni- tive gains.  The resulting contribution will be significant because it will demonstrate the efficacy of using IIV to identify cognitive plasticity resulting from activity interventions with older adults, and provide insight into neurological plasticity without costly examination. Further, this project will have a positive impact in helping to identify activ- ity domains of particular importance for cognitive plasticity, which can then be used to enhance activity inter- ventions for older adults to improve cognitive functioning and potentially delay cognitive decline and dementia."
"9409131","PROJECT SUMMARY Millions of Americans are suffering from the devastation of cognition decline and other neurological dysfunctions due to one of the neurodegenerative diseases of tauopathy. Some of the prominent tauopathies include Alzheimer?s disease, Pick?s disease, traumatic brain injury, and chronic encephalopathy. There is no cure for any of the tauopathies, and the actual cause or exogenous risk factors are unknown. Tauopathies share the common pathological deposition of abnormal, hyperphosphorylated tau protein in selective neurons in the form of neurofibrillary tangles. The normal tau protein is believed to contribute to axonal functions. Hyperphosphorylation causes tau to dissociate from axonal microtubules, and relocates to soma and dendrites where the hyperphosphorylated tau molecules can aggregate into macromolecules of different sizes and morphology. Histologically, the most conspicuous tau aggregates are the neurofibrillary tangles. However, the soluble oligomeric aggregates of hyperphosphorylated tau have been shown in cell and animal models to be cytotoxic, and can even spread from the diseased to healthy neurons in a prion-like fashion. In theory, small-molecule compounds that can inhibit the aggregation of tau are promising drugs for tauopathy treatment. Conversely, those that trigger or enhance aggregation of hyperphosphorylated tau are potential risk factors. Whereas compounds with potential therapeutic values are yet to be discovered, we have evidence that several neurological prescription drugs linked epidemiologically to elevated risks of Alzheimer?s disease can effectively facilitate the in vitro aggregation of hyperphosphorylated tau, but not its unphosphorylated tau counterpart. Dr. Kuo?s team from Michigan State University obtained results suggesting that certain pharmaceutical and environmental risk factors for tauopathies may be identifiable via the test for their ability to trigger the formation of pathogenic aggregates of hyperphosphorylated tau. During Phase I of this STTR, Cayman Chemical will collaborate with Dr. Kuo?s team to develop novel assays that feature the aggregation of different classes of hyperphosphorylated tau. These assays, based on the PIMAX method invented by the Kuo lab, will be then used to screen Cayman benzodiazepine collection of drugs. Pending successful development of the assay platform, our Phase II program will focus on implementing the manufacturing scale-up of the assay kits. This new platform, when available, will impact significantly the sectors of public health and pharmaceutical safety. Successful identification and elimination of tauopathy risk factors will directly benefit a large population of patients and their family members. Better understanding of the devastating tauopathies via studies of these risk factors will also promote the development of effective therapeutic and preventative regimes."
"9470559","The mechanosensitive hair cells of the inner ear consist of a precise array of actin-based stereocilia that insert as rootlets into a dense actin-based meshwork known as the cuticular plate Numerous studies have demonstrated that the proteins that shape the stereocilia are required for normal hearing and balance. On the other hand, little is known about the role the proteins that shape the cuticular plate play in hearing and balance. Indeed, the function that the cuticular plate itself endows to hair bundle development and maintenance remains elusive. Within the cuticular plate, ultrastructural analyses from Tilney?s group in the 1980s revealed numerous types of actin- associated proteins, which presumably control the morphology and the integrity of this unique subcellular structure. Supervillin, a 205 kD actin-crosslinking protein from the villin/gelsolin superfamily, regulates actin dynamics by interacting with non-muscle myosin II. Mutations in MYH9 gene that encodes myosin II are linked to the human hearing loss DFNA17. We showed using RNA in situ hybridization that two isoforms of supervillin; svila and svilc are robustly expressed in zebrafish hair cells of the inner ear. We also demonstrated using our novel Svila rabbit polyclonal antiserum that Svila localizes to the cuticular plate of hair cells in the inner ear of zebrafish. In mice, we showed that Svil is also expressed in the hair cells of the inner ear. In agreement, in mice, in the vestibular type I and type II hair cells, Svil localizes to the cuticular plate at both postnatal day 1 and adult stages. In mice cochlea, Svil localizes to the cuticular plate and near the apical junctional complexes of supporting cells, that surround hair cells, including the head plates of Deiters? and outer pillar cells and the apicolateral margins of inner phalangeal cells. Here, we identify supervillin role in the development and function of the mechanosensory hair cells is to bundle actin filament networks to shape the cuticular plate. We are utilizing genetic and molecular biological techniques along with physiological experiments to test this hypothesized role in a zebrafish model. In this grant proposal we further study the role of supervillin in hair bundle formation and function."

"9372813","Project Summary:  In the United States, the American Cancer Society estimates that, in 2015, there will be 45,780 new cases of oral cavity and pharyngeal cancer. Despite new and improved treatments (surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy), the overall 5-year survival rate for oral cavity and pharyngeal cancer in the United States is only 63%. Over 8,650 children and adults still die every year of oral cancers, and many survivors experience treatment-related side effects for many years after diagnosis. Currently, the operating surgeon relies on experience and preoperative imaging to mentally piece together where best to cut. This can lead to inconsistent narrow tumor margins or result in excessive tissue resection in order to clear surgical margins.  The long-term goal of this research is to reduce cancer recurrence while minimizing end-organ damage by robotically performing tumor resection with precise and consistent tumor margins. The following specific aims will enable the development of this technology and demonstrate feasibility:  Aim 1: Develop and evaluate a precise tumor marking method to guide tumor resection with intra- operative surgical imaging.  Aim 2: Compare supervised autonomous tumor resection surgery to current manual and robotic techniques.  This research has the potential to significantly improve outcome of tumor surgery independent of operating surgeon. Starting with oral squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), this approach of tumor marking and supervised autonomous tumor resection could be beneficial in all tumor surgery."

"9413808","PROJECT SUMMARY  The Clinical and Community Resource Core will build on the strong foundation established by the MCRC Patient  Resource Core at MUSC during the past 4 years. Since 2012 this core has served a local, national, international,  and corporate base by providing a well phenotyped longitudinal cohort of predominantly African-American  systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and systemic sclerosis (SSc) patients and matched control data and  banked biological samples. A recent formal survey of the research base indicated that needs are now exceeding  the MCRC infrastructure. First, investigators need more intensive longitudinal follow-up of patients with specific  disease sub-phenotypes such as scleroderma interstitial lung disease and lupus nephritis. Second, fresh  biological specimens such as peripheral blood mononuclear cells and skin biopsies are needed in addition to  banked specimens. Third, additional coordinator support is needed to facilitate efficient collection of fresh  specimens and assist with regulatory requirements. Finally, translational scientists and junior investigators  require consultation about engagement with the community, disease-specific study design and data  interpretation, proposal feasibility analysis, and methods for flexibly adapting the services of the core to their  needs. The Clinical and Community Resource Core (CCR Core) will flexibly expand on the services by providing  the ability to more finely phenotype patients in the medical record in order to efficiently recruit patients for studies  and more rigorously follow the longitudinal cohort during scheduled clinical visits. Automated reporting of specific  SLE and SSc phenotypes will facilitate more efficient remote ordering of biological specimens. This automation  will enable us to refocus coordinator resources to increase the percentage of clinic visits covered by the MCRC  and fulfill requests by the research base. The core?s specific aims are to: 1) Maintain and flexibly expand the  CCR Core with novel electronic health record (EHR) infrastructure to provide a well phenotyped, longitudinal  cohort of SLE and SSc subjects and matched control volunteers to support the current and future needs of the  research base; 2) Maintain and flexibly expand the CCR Core with novel EHR infrastructure to efficiently provide  well phenotyped, banked and fresh biological specimens, both from within and beyond the existing longitudinal  cohort, based on the ongoing and projected future needs of the research base; 3) Provide resources to link  communities impacted by SSc and SLE and investigators in the research process, from project planning to  dissemination and health promotion, by engaging with community members, community organizations and  patient advocacy groups; and 4) Provide consultative and regulatory support to current and future projects of the  research base. No other resource can provide fine phenotype data and samples from this unique population of  patients. The community engagement facilitated by the core can increase the relevance of research performed  by the base as well as its translation to a community of SLE and SSc patients with known health disparities."
"9472084","Saccades are rapid eye movements through which foveate animals examine visual scenes. However, while in natural behavior saccades implement an active sensing strategy for sampling task-relevant cues, these strategies have been seldom investigated and very little is known about their neural mechanisms. In the vast majority of laboratory paradigms, participants (humans or non-human primates) make saccades in a purely exploitative fashion - to harvest rewards, as the primary goal of the task, rather than gather information about future task states. The use of saccades for information sampling raises two major questions beyond those arising in traditional paradigms. First and foremost, how are saccades motivated by uncertainty ? or expected gains in information ? in addition to reward expectation? Second, how is the selection of an informative target (before the saccade) coordinated with the processing of the sampled information (after the saccade)? We examine these questions in the monkey lateral intraparietal area (LIP), a cortical area implicated in top-down oculomotor control, using neural recordings and reversible inactivation combined with a novel information sampling paradigm. In this paradigm, monkeys are free to deploy gaze to obtain information about a reward that accrues after a delay, but receive no rewards or punishments for a specific gaze pattern. Preliminary evidence shows that saccades depend on the monkeys? prior beliefs about reward probability and uncertainty, consistent with computational models of gaze allocation in natural conditions; in addition, target selective LIP cells (1) are modulated by reward and uncertainty, (2) show a trans-saccadic integration of the effects in their pre- and post-saccadic responses, and (3) respond specifically in relation to information sampling rather than global changes in arousal/motivation. Starting from these observations, we aim to understand the functional contribution of area LIP to information sampling based on reward probability and uncertainty. The results are significant because (1) they represent the first investigation of top-down deployment of gaze as an active sensing policy, (2) they will clarify the role of LIP in reward decisions, which has been the topic of protracted debate and (3) will help integrate research on attention and decision making, two cognitive functions that are naturally coordinated but have been so far studied separately. Thus, the studies are expected to have a strong impact on our understanding of attention and information constrained decisions, which are critical in complex behaviors and psychiatric diseases including attention deficit disorder, drug addiction, anxiety and depression."
"9446692","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Shared decision making (SDM) has the potential to improve quality of care and reduce health disparities. To engage in SDM, patients must have both (1) knowledge of the treatment options, and (2) power ? the self- perceived need and capacity ? to influence decision making. SDM interventions, e.g. decision aids, increase knowledge. However, barriers to patient empowerment hinder engagement, including patients? perceptions that their personal input is not valued and doctor-patient power imbalances. Importantly, socioeconomically disadvantaged patients disproportionately experience these barriers. Understanding how decision aids address barriers to disadvantaged patients? engagement in decision making and identifying persistent barriers which can be targeted by adjunct interventions are critical steps towards reducing health disparities. In this study, we use breast cancer surgery as a model to identify and characterize barriers to socioeconomically disadvantaged patients? engagement in SDM. In order for a decision aid to be effective, patients must be able to access and review it; it is therefore critical to consider barriers to access. Yet even after successful review of a decision aid, persistent barriers may limit patients? engagement. The objective of this study is to test the effectiveness of a decision aid in increasing patient engagement in SDM and identify barriers to engagement not mitigated by the decision aid that could be targets for adjunct SDM interventions. We propose a multi-site cluster randomized trial using a stepped wedge design to enroll clinics serving a high proportion of socioeconomically disadvantaged patients within an established national community cancer research network. We will deliver a web-based decision aid via email directly to patients prior to their surgical consult. We will use mixed methods to accomplish the following specific aims: Aim 1, test the effectiveness of a breast cancer surgery decision aid in increasing patient engagement in decision making (measured by power and knowledge) in clinics serving a high proportion of socioeconomically disadvantaged patients; Aim 2, test the extent to which the effect of a decision aid on patient engagement is mediated through the mitigation of barriers, and determine if persistent barriers are disproportionately experienced by socioeconomically disadvantaged patients; and Aim 3, characterize how persistent barriers influence patient engagement in decision making in order to identify targets for adjunct interventions that could implemented in clinics serving a high proportion of socioeconomically disadvantaged patients. By understanding barriers to engagement in SDM that persist despite receipt of a decision aid, we will identify targets for adjunct interventions. Combining the routine pre-consultation delivery of a decision aid with the tailored delivery of adjunct interventions addressing persistent barriers to engagement is a sustainable model of SDM that maximizes clinics? finite resources. If proven effective, this approach will have far-reaching implications across a variety of healthcare decisions."
"9450122","PROJECT SUMMARY Checkpoint blockade immunotherapy has induced dramatic responses in treatment refractory cancers by targeting neoantigens encoded by cancer-specific mutations. Neoantigen load predicts immunotherapeutic response, validating antigen identification as a rational strategy of biomarker discovery. Pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PDAC) however has shown limited efficacy to checkpoint blockade immunotherapy due to presumed neoantigen paucity. However, systematic antigen discovery in PDAC is lacking. 3% of PDAC patients survive > 5 years (long term survivors). As T cell immunity may explain this extreme outcome, they represent the ideal cohort for deep antigen discovery. Using genomic, molecular, and cellular immunoprofiling, computational evolutionary modeling, and neoantigen discovery in these rare long term survivors (n=82), we have discovered that neoantigen quality, but not quantity, is prognostic of survival, and that long term survivors evidence lasting neoantigen-specific T cell immunity. The scientific objectives of this proposal are to address questions essential to translate these findings - 1) is there stage and treatment- specific neoantigen heterogeneity, 2) can neoantigens be identified in the peripheral blood, and 3) can neoantigen quality predict response to immunotherapy. The translational objective is to develop novel tissue and blood-based biomarkers for rational patient and target selection for immunotherapy. The proposal utilizes several highly unique tissue collection strategies ? a) laparoscopic multi-site biopsies to identify stage-specific heterogeneity, b) serial pre- and post-chemotherapy assessment for treatment-specific modulation, and c) evaluation of neoantigen quality as a predictive biomarker on a large, immunotherapeutic PDAC trial. This initiative will also for the first time develop the ability to identify neoantigens in circulating exosomes for blood-based biomarker assessment. The research methodology employs next generation sequencing, transcriptional profiling, computational biophysical modeling, clonotypic T cell profiling, neoantigen discovery, and functional assessments to evaluate the prognostic, predictive, and therapeutic potential of neoantigens. The team comprises of world-class expert junior and senior investigators in a broad range of highly relevant disciplines from Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, Meyer Cancer Center at the Weill Cornell Medical Center, Tisch Cancer Institute at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, and the Institute for Advanced Study. This initiative is directly relevant to the primary objective to develop novel biomarkers and T cell antigenic targets for the successful application of immunotherapy in PDAC."
"9470640","Project Summary: Sonic hedgehog (Shh) signaling is a critical developmental pathway best known to regulate cell fate specification and cell proliferation. This process requires primary cilia and involves Shh activation of downstream effector Smoothened (Smo) and Gli transcription factors (transcription-dependent). Additionally, Shh signaling regulates axon guidance in the developing nervous system as well as fibroblast migration through a distinct, transcription-independent pathway. Arl13b encodes a regulatory GTPase enriched in cilia that regulates transcription-dependent Shh signaling through Smo. Recessive mutations in ARL13B cause the ciliopathy Joubert syndrome (JS), a disorder defined by intellectual disability, cerebellar hypoplasia, and physical deformities. JS is diagnosed by MRI evidence of a hindbrain malformation known as the molar tooth sign, which is caused in part by the white matter tracts comprising the superior cerebellar peduncles (SCPs) failing to cross the midline of the brain. JS patients also exhibit midline crossing defects in the optic chiasm and the corticospinal tract. Collectively, these phenotypes indicate JS patients display axon guidance defects; however, the mechanism connecting cilia genes such as ARL13B to the regulation of axon guidance remains unclear. Because (1) Arl13b regulates transcription-dependent Shh signaling, (2) transcription-independent Shh signaling can regulate axon guidance, and (3) ARL13B mutations result in axon guidance defects in JS, we hypothesize that Arl13b regulates transcription-independent Shh signaling to direct axon guidance in the developing brain. To test this, I examined the direction and uniformity of mouse SCPs lacking either Smo or Arl13b by performing diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). I showed that SCPs lacking Smo display significant axon guidance defects in the hindbrain, indicating axon guidance in these projection neurons is Smo-dependent and suggesting Shh as a possible guidance cue. Furthermore, there is an axon guidance defect in SCPs lacking Arl13b, suggesting Arl13b regulates this transcription-independent Shh signaling pathway. Additionally, fibroblasts lacking Arl13b display decreased migration toward Shh. However, fibroblasts are able to migrate in the absence of cilia, suggesting that Arl13b may have a non-ciliary function in the regulation of transcription- independent Shh signaling. Therefore, we hypothesize that Arl13b works outside of the cilium to regulate transcription-independent Sonic hedgehog signaling to direct fibroblast migration in vitro as well as axon guidance in vivo during neural development. The aims of this project are 1) to use non-ciliary Arl13b and Smo variants to test whether Arl13b function in fibroblast migration occurs outside the cilium via modified Boyden chamber assays and 2) to define the role of Arl13b in axon guidance by examining the ability of SCP axons to cross the midline of the brain in Arl13b and Smo mouse mutants through DTI and retrograde tract tracing. Through these methods, I aim to define the role of Arl13b in transcription-independent Shh signaling and establish a novel connection between cilia-associated genes and axon guidance."
"9355047","DESCRIPTION         Musculoskeletal injuries affect over 28 million patients in the United States each year, in both the civilian and military populations. Analysis of casualty data suggests that a high number of injuries sustained in combat may require restoration of structures such as the flexor tendon, rotator cuff and Achilles tendon. Unfortunately, these structures have a poor healing capacity, thought to be due in part to the large amount of inflammation during the first several weeks following repair. Historically, clinicians have prescribed non-steroidal anti-inflammatories (NSAIDs) after tendon repair to reduce pain and inflammation but recent studies suggest that these drugs may be detrimental to the healing process. Contrastingly, one study showed improved healing after a delayed delivery of NSAIDs, suggesting that perhaps some inflammation is necessary for beginning the appropriate wound healing cascade but that early and sustained inflammation could be detrimental to tissue remodeling. Therefore, the objective of this study is to investigate the effect of NSAIDs in the early phases of repair on tendon healing by studying both a dose and time dependent delivery of NSAIDs. We hypothesize that local delivery of NSAIDs by release from a microsphere-laden scaffold will have a more pronounced effect on tendon repair mechanical properties than delivery via oral gavage. Additionally, we hypothesize that a late delivery (7-14 days) of the drugs will improve healing while early delivery (0-7 days) will inhibit healing. The hypotheses will be evaluated using a clinically relevant rat model of rotator cuff injury in a degenerative tendon in conjunction with or novel nanofibrous scaffold-microsphere composite delivery system. Assessment of the tensile mechanical properties of the tendons as well as collagen organization, cellularity, cell shape, fibril morphology and the presence of inflammatory cells, could help to deduce the specific mechanisms by which NSAID delivery affects tendon healing. This proposal will specifically address this uncertainty by assessing the delivery of NSAIDs both locally and systemically. Augmentation of the repair combined with concurrent drug delivery in this manner could enhance long-term tendon healing and limit inflammation following rotator cuff repair. In addition, determining a better solution to pain management following musculoskeletal tissue repair, such as delayed NSAID delivery, could help to avoid medications that lead to high morbidity, such as opioids and narcotics."
"9357395","PROJECT 3: Targeting the D4Z4 sequence to enhance repeat repression Abstract FSHD is caused by mutations that decrease the efficiency of D4Z4 repeat-mediated epigenetic repression and result in the low-level variegated mis-expression of DUX4 in skeletal muscle. The broad and long-term goal of this project is to identify components and modulators of the pathways that epigenetically silence D4Z4 repeats that can be exploited to develop a therapy for FSHD, and potentially other human diseases. The major hypothesis of this project is that enhancing the efficiency of repeat-mediated epigenetic repression will suppress DUX4 expression in FSHD muscle and decrease, or reverse, the progression of disease. The specific goal of the project is to identify compounds, their mechanisms of action, and their pre-clinical efficacy in suppressing DUX4 expression in skeletal muscle. This will be accomplished by: Aim 1, Identify and characterize drug-like compounds that enhance the epigenetic repression of D4Z4 and suppress DUX4 expression; Aim 2, Determine the pathways and sequences necessary for D4Z4 epigenetic repression; and Aim 3, perform preclinical development of oligonucleotides to enhance repression of D4Z4 and DUX4 expression. Together these aims will identify compounds, their mechanisms of action, and their pre-clinical efficacy in suppressing DUX4 expression in skeletal muscle. The significance of these studies is that they will identify compounds, their mechanisms of action, and their pre-clinical efficacy in suppressing DUX4 expression in skeletal muscle. The health relatedness is that these studies will provide the basis for future human clinical studies in FSHD."

"9385478","Adenoviral conjunctivitis is one of the most common conditions in all of medicine. Despite being a common cause of morbidity world-wide, there are no known host or pathogen factors that predict clinical outcomes in adenoviral keratoconjunctivitis (AdV KC). A recent, large, international clinical study of adenovirus-related KC revealed that approximately 10% of patients suffer from sustained visual loss. Preliminary deep DNA sequencing of AdV has revealed an unexpected sequence diversity in the viral genome, with ~8% sequence divergence even amongst samples with the same hexon-defined molecular type. Remarkably, 20% of the patients in this study lacked any polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or deep DNA sequencing evidence for adenovirus.  Given the unexpected molecular variation of adenovirus and a large spectrum of clinical outcome in KC, we propose to analyze host and viral factors contributing to poor outcome (Aim 1). Using next generation DNA sequencing, we propose to catalog the molecular variants of adenovirus and correlate these with clinical outcomes as well (Aim 2). The results of these studies will expand our understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of viral conjunctivitis, and may provide biomarkers for predicting outcomes from this condition. These advances will facilitate future efforts toward developing therapies for this common condition."
"9313129","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The social norms marking approach to health promotion is an environmental change strategy that targets the entire social context surrounding dating and sexual violence. Whereas community-wide social norms marketing campaigns have been successfully implemented to address a range of public health issues, research has yet to rigorously examine the efficacy of social norms marketing as a community-level change strategy for dating and sexual violence prevention. Understanding the unique contribution of social norms marketing campaigns in promoting environmental change is a vital first step to understanding their role as part of a comprehensive multi-level violence prevention approach. Results of this research will make a significant contribution to the evidence base of violence prevention by testing a comprehensive, tailored, data-based social norms marketing campaign for middle schools that addresses misperceptions of: 1) the acceptability of dating and sexual violence; 2) gender roles; 3) sexual activity; 4) sexual communication/consent; 5) support for victims; and 6) bystander intervention. Students, parents, teachers and administrators will be targeted as carriers of community misperceptions through the implementation of community-specific posters, a Lunch and Learn Teacher Training, a Social Norms Video, a Teacher Workbook, a Parent Mailing, and a Parent Information Session. A School Resource Provider will work with a teacher champion to implement the campaign and identify/address kick-back. To identify environmental moderators of program effects, the Resource Provider will work with school administrators to conduct a community readiness assessment, and document neighborhood characteristics that potentially influence dating and sexual violence, such as number of alcohol outlets and presence of highly sexualized billboards or buildings. In the Refinement and Planning Phase, stakeholder interviews, establishment of a Research Advisory Board, consultation with experts in social norms marketing, and administration of an open pilot trial will be used to refine the campaign and research procedures. In the Intervention Phase, we will conduct a group randomized trial among 30 middle schools to demonstrate efficacy of the approach in reducing rates of dating and sexual violence and promoting change in community norms over a 6-month follow-up, relative to a wait-list control. In the Analysis and Dissemination Phase, we will conduct cost-effectiveness analyses, prepare project reports, and share study findings with schools and the scientific community. Partnership between researchers and a CDC RPE-funded community agency in this research will build local capacity and ensure that the campaign is both feasible and sustainable. If deemed successful, the final products of this research will ensure that the approach can be readily implemented in middle schools as one component of a multi-level prevention approach."
"9419405","The recent attack on civilians in Syria using an organophosphate (OP) nerve agent, sarin, confirms its continued threat to humans. OP nerve agents are potent seizurogenic neurotoxins. OP intoxication, in long-term, will cause irreversible brain damage due to hyperexcitability of neurons, reactive gliosis, and neurodegeneration. If these are not adequately controlled at a very early stage, they will lead to the development of epilepsy, cognitive deficits and other neurological disorders. Currently there is no treatment for long-term effects. The current toxin-specific and symptomatic drugs atropine, oxime, and diazepam (DZP) are inadequate to prevent OP-induced long-term brain injury. DZP controls seizures and could be neuroprotective if it is given within 30 minutes of OP exposure. This is impossible to achieve in real life scenarios of mass OP exposure. Therefore the objective of the project is to test two novel neuroprotectants, diapocynin and 1400W that are not previously tested in OP intoxication models, to prevent long-term brain damage. OP exposure increases the levels of reactive oxygen/nitrogen species (ROS/RNS), which cause long-term brain damage. The diapocynin, an effective NADPH oxidase inhibitor targets ROS. The 1400W, a potent and highly selective inhibitor of inducible nitric oxide synthase targets RNS, and no adverse effects or toxicity are reported when it was tested in humans and rodent models. Both neuroprotectants are blood-brain barrier permeable and ameliorated long-term neuropathology in rodent models of epilepsy, Parkinson's disease, and traumatic brain injury. ROS and RNS are also increased in these models. Therefore, our overarching hypothesis is that diapocynin and/or 1400W, given after the symptomatic drugs, will protect OP-induced long-term brain pathology. To test the hypothesis, we will use our established diisopropylfluorophosphate (DFP, a surrogate for nerve agents) rat model to replicate a real life scenario of nerve agent poisoning. Our preliminary studies from this model revealed an increased production of ROS/RNS and cytokines levels between 24-48h after the DFP exposure. At 1 week, hyperexcitability of neurons (increased epileptiform spiking on the EEG), reactive gliosis (astrocytes/microglia markers), and neurodegeneration (increased number of flurojade-B positive neurons) were observed in the hippocampus. Both diapocynin and 1400W suppressed these DFP-induced changes during the 24-48h and at 1 week, and also reduced the number of seizures during the first 4 weeks. These findings suggest long-term neuroprotective potential of diapocynin and 1400W in OP poisoning. In the proposed study, we will further validate these findings comprehensively by utilizing various histological and biochemical assays from serum and hippocampi samples at 4 week, cognitive function test, and continuous video-EEG monitoring for 12 weeks. The positive outcome from our study will provide proof-of-concept for long-term neuroprotective properties of diapocynin and 1400W in DFP-induced brain injury. This will help us to advance the compounds as potential countermeasures for real nerve agents by optimizing in preclinical testing for potency, toxicity, and pharmacokinetics (ADME studies)."
"9348934","ABSTRACT A central question in cell biology is how spatial information on the micron-length scale is encoded within the cellular cytoplasm. This is essential for maintaining genome integrity during mitosis where the cell-cleavage plane must be precisely positioned at the center of a ~ 10-15 um long cell during cytokinesis. It is now well established that the microtubule cytoskeleton plays a critical role in this process by forming a specialized structure proximal to the site of cell cleavage. This structure, known as the spindle midzone, acts as a micron scale `mark' for the cell center. These micron-scale marks are then `read' by signaling proteins that generate self- organizing activity patterns that further precisely define the site of cell-cleavage. Subsequently this information is transmitted to the cell cortex for the organization of the contractile ring. We now have a near complete parts list of the proteins that regulate these processes. However, the molecular mechanism by which the midzone templates the formation of spatial activity patterns of regulatory proteins within the cytoplasm and the cell cortex is starkly incomplete. Here we will develop in vitro reconstitution assays using microtubules, reconstituted bilayer, singe molecule FRET sensors and DNA origami-based nanotemplates to decipher how spatial organization of signaling activity is achieved on microtubule templates and how these reactions are organized at membrane-microtubule interface. These studies will provide insights into a conserved signaling cascade that is critical for cell division and its mis-regulation in human cancer. Importantly, the innovative methodologies developed here will be widely applicable to dissecting other signaling mechanisms by which spatial activity patterns are encoded and deciphered in the cellular cytoplasm during cell division, growth and development.  "
"9425261","Project Summary  Innate lymphoid cells (ILC) are recently discovered tissue-resident self-renewing immune cells with critical roles in barrier defense, tissue regeneration and immune regulation. Our preliminary data indicate that ILC gradually diminish in number with age. The goal of this project is to understand the cellular and molecular mechanisms that result in loss of ILC with age, and to examine whether diminished ILC numbers contribute to increased susceptibility to infections and diseases in the aged. This project focuses on group-2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2), the predominant ILC subset in the lung. We hypothesize that decreased TCF-1 expression impairs ILC2 self-renewal and results in diminished numbers of ILC2 with age, and that diminished ILC2 responses contribute to increased susceptibility to influenza infection in the aged. We will use novel TCF- 1YFP and TCF-1 conditional knockout mice to explore the cellular and molecular mechanisms that control the longevity and self-renewal of lung-resident ILC2. We will determine whether dysregulation of such mechanisms results in loss of ILC2 with age. We will further use adoptive transfer approaches to examine whether and how diminished ILC2 responses contribute to increased susceptibility to influenza in aged mice. Finally, we will develop strategies to restore ILC2 numbers in the aged, and will test the efficacy of these strategies to enhance resistance to influenza in old mice. We anticipate that this work will provide significant insights into lymphocyte aging, and will inform strategies to improve immune defense in the elderly."
"9471125","The US has the highest incarceration rate in the world. Each year in the US, jails incarcerate 12 million people, most of whom are either awaiting sentencing or serving out short sentences. Persons of color are incarcerated at disproportionately high rates, and as a class, incarcerated persons have worse health than other US residents. Jail inmates shoulder a heavy burden of mental health conditions (64%), chemical dependency (68%), infectious diseases (14%) and other chronic conditions (45%). Custody in jail can be a time of heightened physical and emotional stress, and indeed myocardial infarction and suicide are the two most frequent causes of death during incarceration. The heavy burden of health problems and large size of this population in combination with generally short incarcerations and limited healthcare resources present formidable challenges addressing jail inmates? healthcare needs. These challenges may be particularly difficult for southern jails, which are often small-sized and located in rural, resource-limited communities whose populations have relatively high rates of poverty and disability compared to other US regions.  In recent years, deaths occurring during incarceration have created heightened attention regarding jail health services, and in 2011 there was a broad national survey of jail inmates? self-reported health conditions. However, the broad inmate survey did not reflect acute care needs and was susceptible to self-report bias, while reported deaths are rare events that provide only limited insight into inmates? health and healthcare. Because of a variety of barriers, few studies have examined the delivery of healthcare for jail inmates.  Robust indicators of inmates? immediate healthcare needs?and the extent to which their needs exceed jail healthcare resources?could be used to target interventions to improve jail healthcare and reduce costs. A novel and potentially powerful indicator signaling that inmates? healthcare needs exceed jail healthcare resources is the extent to which jails use community Emergency Management Service (EMS) ambulances and emergency departments (EDs) to provide care. Enumerating the prevalence of health conditions, particularly traumas and ambulatory-care sensitive conditions, resulting in EMS/ED care may in turn identify opportunities to modify jail policies?both custodial and health?to diminish violence, improve health, and reduce healthcare costs. Accordingly, using a combination of prospective survey findings and analyses of statewide emergency care databases in 5 southern US states, we will examine the healthcare resources available in county jails, describe the frequency and types of conditions for which jails rely upon EMS and ED care to supplement their health services, and estimate the cost savings that jails could accrue by preventing the need for EMS, ED, and hospitalization care for ambulatory-sensitive conditions and traumas. These findings will represent a key tool in strengthening jail healthcare, improving inmate health, reducing costs, and ultimately, protecting the health of the families and communities to which inmates return"
"9349247","Project summary There is a fundamental gap in our ability to target the non-coding genome for therapeutic benefit. While the druggable genome is expanding, it still remains confined to the tiny fraction of the human genome encoding for genes. This exclusion of the non-coding genome is unfortunate, as these regions can provide a powerful han- dle to finely control cellular responses and are more flexible than gene-targeting approaches. Our long-term goal is to develop a predictive and functional understanding of the non-coding genome, which will elucidate how these regions can be specifically targeted for genomic medicine. Towards this long-term goal, the objec- tive of this proposal is to systematically interrogate the combinatorial biology of enhancer gene regulation. We will pursue this objective at three levels: from the action of multiple protein effectors on individual enhancers, to the cooperativity between multiple enhancers, and culminating in the genome-wide coordination of multiple transcription factors to influence cell state. We have developed an innovative platform that enables high throughput assessment of combinatorial gene regulation, which will play a central role in this proposal. Our overall hypothesis is that, across multiple levels, combinatorial gene regulation uses a small set of components to create a broad spectrum of functionalities. We further hypothesize that the rules governing these functionali- ties can be explained by defining the key components, and examining how each functions alone and in simple combinations. The rationale for the proposed research is that a fundamental understanding of combinatorial gene regulation will enable predictive targeting of the non-coding genome for genomic medicine, leading to in- novative approaches to the prevention and treatment of disease. This proposal opens new research horizons to understanding the underlying concepts of combinatorial gene regulation and the epigenetic mechanisms un- derlying enhancer function, and for improved methods to modulate enhancer activity and engineer custom gene regulatory programs. Ultimately, this knowledge will be required to harness the genome for engineering and to understand how non-coding regulators contribute to development and disease."
"9402287","Project Summary/Abstract The overall goal of this proposal is to elucidate how to regrow and reconnect injured optic nerves and tracts to specific target neurons in the brain. Specifically, this proposal investigates mechanisms that promote the regeneration of connections made by direction selective retinal ganglion cells (DSGC) to their the accessory optic targets in the brainstem (collectively referred to as the ?Accessory Optic System,? or ?AOS?). The AOS serves a crucial role in vision by generating slip-compensating eye movements whenever the head or the eyes move at slow speeds. In the absence of proper AOS connectivity and function, images appear blurry and perceptual performance is severely degraded. From a practical standpoint, understanding how to regenerate the mammalian AOS, and defining the cellular and molecular underpinnings of that regeneration, represent an ideal model for parsing regeneration of other visual parallel pathways and also mammalian CNS circuits generally. The AOS is comprised of known retinal neurons and circuits, and the central targets and information carried in this pathway are rather well understood. Indeed, significant progress has been made by our and other groups in identifying genetic markers for the DSGCs that drive AOS function and also cellular and molecular pathways that wire them to their targets. Moreover, both of our laboratories have adopted and expanded state-of-the-art approaches to measure AOS function at the whole animal level with quantitative rigor. In parallel to our work, the field of CNS visual system regeneration has reached the crucial milestone of identifying molecular and activity-based manipulations that allow some retinal ganglion cell (RGC) axons to regenerate following axotomy. The next crucial milestone is to figure out how to ensure accurate reconnection of specific RGC types with their correct targets in the brain. Importantly, it remains unclear whether, after damage to the retina or optic nerve, RGCs and/or their targets re-express, or maintain expression of, the receptors or ligands that enabled them to correctly wire up with one another during development. It is also imperative to determine how the specificity of axon-target matching at the level of cell types and targets, impacts circuit function and behavior. Now that the molecular programs for these developmental steps have started to become clear, this essential issue relating to optic nerve regeneration can finally be approached with deep rigor, and we propose here do that in the context of the AOS. The four major aims of this proposal are to: 1) Test the hypothesis that AOS-projecting RGCs are among the cohort of RGC types capable of regenerating in response to increases in mTOR activation and/or RGC firing. 2) Test the hypothesis that damage to AOS-projecting RGCs and their axons triggers robust changes in axon guidance receptors and ligands in the relevant RGCs and targets. 3) . Test the hypothesis that re-introduction of specific guidance receptors and ligands to AOS-projecting RGCs can be used to steer their axons to desired brain areas. 4) Test the hypothesis that regeneration of a small fraction of total retinofugal connectivity is sufficient to replenish functional recovery of the optokinetic reflex and nystagmus necessary for image stabilization."
"9453833","Abstract Reversible protein S-palmitoylation is an abundant posttranslational modification in the nervous system and is a key regulatory mechanism in numerous neuronal signaling pathways. Substrates for protein S- palmitoylation include neurotransmitter receptors and transporters, signal transducing GTPases, and synaptic scaffolds. Members of the DHHC family of protein acyltransferases mediate the addition of palmitate or other long-chain fatty acids to proteins and have been linked to a number of neurological disorders including intellectual disability and Huntington's Disease. The importance of S-palmitoylation as a regulatory modification in neuronal function and the alterations in S-palmitoylation associated with human disease warrant a mechanistic understanding of the enzymes that mediate this process. Accordingly, our long-term goals are to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying DHHC enzyme activity and its regulation by determining the first atomic resolution structure of a DHHC protein by x-ray crystallography. The goals of this proposal are to understand how self-association of DHHC proteins regulates their enzyme activity and to crystallize a DHHC protein. Using a bioluminescence resonance energy transfer assay in cells and in vitro enzyme assays with purified proteins, we determined that DHHC2 and DHHC3 proteins self-associate and that the extent of self-association tightly correlated with its enzyme activity. Furthermore, our pre-crystallization screening revealed that monodisperse and stable DHHC protein constructs exist predominantly as dimers. Based on these findings, we propose that DHHC PATs exist in a monomer-dimer equilibrium in cell membranes, where the monomeric form is active and the associated form is inactive. Testing this hypothesis is key to understanding how enzyme activity is regulated and critical for identifying conditions that will stabilize the protein for crystallization. We propose the following lines of investigation. (1) To address the activity states of the monomeric and dimeric forms of DHHC proteins, we will independently reconstitute DHHC monomers and dimers into nanodiscs and measure their enzyme activity. We will use single molecule photobleaching and total internal refection microscopy to determine the subunit stoichiometry of DHHC proteins expressed at the cell surface. (2) To identify conditions for the crystallization of a DHHC protein, we will optimize the DHHC construct using protein engineering. Folding- specific monoclonal antibodies will be generated and used to stabilize the construct. Crystallization conditions will be expanded to include the use of bicelles and lipidic cubic phases. Successful outcomes of these aims will greatly increase the chance of determining the much-needed first crystal structure of a DHHC protein, which we expect will become a strong foundation for understanding the molecular mechanisms of protein palmitoylation."
"9470779","Project Summary/Abstract Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a developmental neuropsychiatric disorder characterized by a wide range of clinical manifestations and genetic heterogeneity. This complex genetic landscape poses a serious challenge to e?orts to ?nd a relationship between genotype and clinical phenotype in ASD. Therefore, the disorder remains poorly understand, and diagnostic and treatment tools are lacking. Though genetic overlap between patients is low, many mutations in autism likely a?ect stereotyped biological pathways, resulting in subgroups of autistic patients with similar functional mutation burden. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that patients with functionally similar mutations can be clustered together in order to reveal previously unidenti?ed groups that share both molecular mechanisms and disease related cognitive traits. This proposal ?rst describes an algorithm for genomic subtype detection of autistic patients using graph clustering and a novel distance function that is based on gene ontology, a database that describes the functional relationship of genes. Next, it is shown that resulting patient clusters are de?ned by both unique and convergent involvement of genetic pathways, which provides insight into the variety of disease mechanisms that may be present in ASD. These potential mechanisms can be explored at the cellular level by connecting the clustering algorithm with data from ASD patient derived neurons. Finally, cluster membership is associated with di?erences in the clinical and cognitive variables, validating the relevance of the genomic subtypes. In addition, deep learning approaches to describe individualized clinical prediction are discussed. Genome clustering in autism is an important step towards de?ning both mechanistic and clinical subtypes in this complex disorder, and this proposal addresses a growing need for algorithmic tools that connect genotype to phenotype in the context of heritable mental illnesses."
"9424216","Project Summary Globally, more than 18 million people are infected with HIV, 10.4 million people are infected with tuberculosis, and over 200 million people become infected by malaria in a single year. There is a critical unmet need for vaccines against these infections and studies using mouse models have not yielded effective vaccines. The development of a functional memory response that enables the immune system to react quickly and robustly to previously experienced pathogens is the single most important factor for vaccine efficacy. Defining the mechanisms by which memory T cell responses are generated in humans is essential for developing efficacious vaccines. Previous studies in laboratory mice have shown that primary T cell responses to novel antigens originate from naïve T cells. However, mice maintained under specific pathogen-free conditions are vastly different from humans in the extent of their microbial exposure. Our lab was the first to describe that human adults possess pre-existing memory phenotype (TMP) CD4+ T cells specific for viral antigens to which they have never been exposed. We further demonstrated that nearly a quarter of HIV-reactive T cell clones isolated from uninfected people also respond to unrelated microbial peptides, suggesting that these TMP cells are broadly cross-reactive to many different antigens. The development of TMPs likely reflects the cumulative exposure to environmental antigens following thymic development and these cells may be the earliest cells to respond during a primary infection. Here, we will build on these foundations and use yellow fever virus (YFV) vaccination as a model to test the hypothesis that pre-primed TMP cells generate potent effectors and preferentially give rise to post-vaccination memory T cells in humans. We will use a specific cell-labeling reagent called tetramers to tag T cells that recognize YFV antigens before vaccination and at multiple times after vaccination. This will allow us to trace YFV-reactive T cells directly ex vivo as they evolve following vaccination. Specifically, we will address the following questions: (1) does TMP cells have a greater functional diversity and plasticity compared to classic memory T cells; (2) does the abundance or the composition of TMP cells predict the rate and the magnitude of the effector response; (3) does TMP cells preferentially give rise to post-vaccination memory T cells? This study will reveal basic paradigms of how pre- existing memory precursors impact the potency and durability of CD4+ T cell immunity in vaccination. Understanding how the environment conditions the human T cell repertoire to influence later responses extends beyond vaccine efficacy and is broadly relevant to many areas of human health, including infection, autoimmunity, and cancer surveillance"
"9278046","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Project 7 ? How Health Insurance Affects Health Understanding the consequences of health insurance coverage is central to evaluating proposals to expand or modify health insurance coverage in the U.S. Yet there is remarkably little convincing evidence on the impact of insuring the uninsured on their medical utilization, health outcomes, health behaviors, or overall well-being, largely because enrolling in health insurance is a choice that is made jointly with other choices that determine these outcomes. This project takes advantage of a remarkable opportunity to provide just such evidence. For a limited window in early 2008, Oregon opened a waiting list for enrollment in its public health insurance program for low income adults, and then randomly drew names from the list to determine who would be given the opportunity to enroll. This unique policy environment provided researchers with a rare occasion to bring the strengths of random assignment ? the standard in medical trials ? to address a critical social policy question. This proposal builds on our prior work assessing the effects of Medicaid on health care use, health, and well-being, including a focus on the near-elderly (those aged 50-64) whose health risks are in many ways similar to those aged 65 and up and who will soon age onto Medicare themselves. We found that Medicaid substantially increased health care use across settings (including primary care, hospitals, prescription drugs, and emergency departments (EDs)); reduced financial strain (including bills sent to collection and catastrophic out-of-pocket expenses); and reduced the prevalence of depression; but had no detectable effects on several measures of physical health (including blood pressure, cholesterol, and diabetic blood sugar control). This project will leverage our work on the Oregon Health Insurance Experiment to build several new data sets and conduct new analyses to assess multi-faceted effects of Medicaid coverage on health and other outcomes, including: care and health outcomes for chronic physical conditions and mental health, including diabetes, asthma, and depression; patterns of ED and hospital use over time and substitutability of different sites of care; and dental care and outcomes. We will also develop a novel econometric method for assessing and synthesizing the multidimensional effects of insurance on health. As policy-makers and stakeholders assess the broad consequences of expanded access to health insurance, we believe these analyses will add crucial evidence on the many potential effects of Medicaid on health care use, quality, and long-term health outcomes of an aging population."
"9449201","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Parasitic protozoa rely on purine salvage pathways for which the enzyme hypoxanthine-guanine-xanthine phosphoribosyltransferase (HGXPRT; hereafter, purine phosphoribosyltransferase (PPRT)) is essential. The genus Trypanosoma causes debilitating human diseases of high morbidity. Neither vaccines nor useful therapies exist. Trypanosoma cruzi causes Chagas?s Disease in Central and South America, with over 40 cases recently reported in Texas. Trypanosoma brucei rhodosiense and Trypanosoma brucei gambiense cause African sleeping sickness. Parasitic protozoa including T. cruzi and T. brucei are incapable of purine biosynthesis de novo and make nucleotides and nucleosides by purine salvage pathways. PPRT catalyzes the formation of GMP, IMP, and XMP from 5-phospho-ribose 1-pyrophosphate (PRPP) and the respective bases, guanine, hypoxanthine, and xanthine. Plasmodium falciparum, causes the most virulent form of malaria, and is also a purine auxotroph for which the action of PPRT is the only physiological path for hypoxanthine incorporation into the nucleotide pool. Transition-state analogue inhibitors (TSAIs) based on transition states for related phosphoribosyltransferases are inhibitors of P. falciparum PPRT. Cell-permeable prodrugs blocked the proliferation of P. falciparum in culture and showed selectivity vs. human HGPRT, despite the high structural similarity and active-site conservation of the enzymes. This research will design, synthesize, and characterize both in vitro and in vivo novel inhibitors of the PPRTs from P. falciparum, T. brucei ssp. and T. cruzi. Transition-state methodology, quantum computational chemistry, X-ray structure-based inhibitor design and expert chemical synthesis will be used for inhibitor development. Existing lead compounds of sub-nanomolar potency for PPRT from P. falciparum will initiate and inform our inhibitor program. Crystal structures have been reported for T. cruzi PPRT, but no potent inhibitors have been defined. No inhibitor development for T. brucei has been reported, and PPRTs have not been kinetically characterized from T. brucei. The generation of new lead compounds is anticipated to proceed rapidly for P. falciparum PPRT and emerge for Trypanosoma PPRTs once the transition-state structures of these enzymes have been solved. Optimized inhibitors which bind each of the target PPRTs will be evaluated by X-ray crystallography, to provide a refinement guide for chemistry. Potent and selective (vs. human HGPRT) inhibitors of the PPRTs will be evaluated in cell cultures of P. falciparum, T. cruzi, and T. brucei ssp for parasiticidal activity. The most effective of these will be evaluated in murine models of Malaria, Chagas?s disease and African sleeping sickness. Importantly, a successful outcome from this proposal could lead to new therapeutic agents to treat three diseases which comprise unmet or under-met medical needs. This development plan uses transition state theory to meet the NIH goals of reducing the lead time for drug development."
"9332118","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The SEARCH for Diabetes in Youth Study documented a 31% increase in the prevalence of type 2 diabetes (T2D) between 2001 and 2009, as well as an increase of 21 % in the prevalence of type 1 diabetes (T1D). Increases occurred across most but not all major subgroups of age, sex and race/ethnicity. Further, we documented an annual increase in the incidence of T1D among non-Hispanic White (NHW) youth of approximately 2.7% per year. In contrast, studies from Europe suggest that incidence of T1D may be stabilizing. Thus, compelling questions remain regarding long term trends in incidence and prevalence for both T1 and T2 in youth, particularly among various racial and ethnic population subgroups. Ongoing, efficient surveillance of diabetes diagnosed in youth is essential to inform health care systems and generate testable hypotheses related to the natural history of diabetes in youth. SEARCH is uniquely positioned to address these critical questions through continued surveillance of childhood diabetes employing our well-established infrastructure for surveillance, and its highly experienced, collaborative and multi-disciplinary investigative team. Therefore, in response to RFA-DP-15-002, Component A, we propose the continuation of the SEARCH for Diabetes in Youth Registry Study (SEARCH Phase 4) during which we will continue to ascertain newly diagnosed incident diabetes cases throughout the study period and one additional prevalent cohort (index year 2017) for youth age < 20 years across our five well-established geographically dispersed Study Centers. Our approach is informed by our substantial accrued experience that allows us to conduct surveillance work in a highly efficient manner. We frame our surveillance as an innovative three-tiered approach, starting with the most broad based and cost efficient approach at the highest tier (tier 1) and becoming the most focused in tier 3, with each tier optimizing use of electronic health records (EHRs). Specific Aims are: Aim 1: TIER 1 SURVEILLANCE (Prevalence)- To ascertain cases of prevalent diabetes in calendar year 2017 among youth age < 20 years at diagnosis; Aim 2: TIER 2 SURVEILLANCE (Incidence)- To continue to ascertain newly diagnosed (2015-2020) incident diabetes cases in youth age < 20 years; Aim 3: TIER 3 SURVEILLANCE (Clinical Characteristics) - To confirm classification of diabetes type using biochemical markers, to describe selected clinical characteristics at diagnosis, and to maintain an infrastructure that facilitates the development of more detailed ancillary studies by storing biological samples and preserving contact with potential study participants; Aim 4: OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCY: To optimize efficiency of the SEARCH Surveillance activities through targeted development and validation projects designed to utilize relevant electronic health data to operationalize each of the three tiers of surveillance. Thus, the well-established and highly productive SEARCH team is uniquely positioned to provide critical information on the prevalence, incidence and early clinical course of diabetes in youth."
"9370180","X-ray crystallography is the predominant method used to visualize biological macromolecules at an atomic level of detail. Crystals are mandatory for these structure determinations. The High-Throughput Crystallization Screening (HTS) Laboratory at the Hauptman-Woodward Institute is a community resource that provides crystallization information in a rapid and efficient manner so that structural investigations can rapidly progress. We have developed two sets of 1536 chemical cocktails designed to maximize crystallization potential and chemical solubility information for biological macromolecules for both structural and other scientific applications. In less than ten minutes, liquid-handling systems combine the community-provided sample with chemical cocktails in a single, compact, 1536-well plate. We image the experiments at weekly intervals for six weeks and provide users with immediate access to images. This includes software developed in-house, to view and analyze the results. We employ a state-of-the-art imaging system with a femtosecond pulse laser to detect crystals, including submicron crystals that are too small to see using traditional microscopy. If there are crystals, we are able to detect them. An expert reviews the outcomes for all samples sent to the laboratory to identify crystals and provides this information to the investigators. A graphical summary report provides investigators with relational chemical solubility and crystallization information in readily interpretable formats. The goal of the HTS Laboratory is to provide a rapid turnaround of solubility and crystallization information for community-provided samples to enable rapid scientific process. Our publication records, and associated publications and PDB depositions from structural genomics and the scientific community collaborations support our 15+ year history in the research, development and application of crystallization assays to more than 16,000 samples provided by hundreds of investigators."
"9385374","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Mount Sinai will partner with the National Institute of Public Health, Mexico and Columbia University to continue to follow 700 children at ages 8-11 in the PROGRESS birth cohort established in 2006 in Mexico City to study perinatal programming of child development. PROGRESS is a state of the art birth cohort that has developed innovative new methods to estimate past exposure to environmental chemicals, both with biomarkers of internal dose (e.g. teeth based chemical assays) and with geospatial modeling of the external environment via remote sensing(e.g. air pollution, green space etc). This application will also leverage Mount Sinai's recently established Environmental Health Sciences Laboratory to build upon our internationally recognized research expertise in children's environmental health. Our mission is to measure environmental exposures across pregnancy and childhood to determine how these factors affect neurodevelopment and growth. We are especially excited to extend this work in PROGRESS as our overarching goal is to prepare the cohort the coming era of exposomic research. In this R24 we will test methods for data harmonization that will be critical to future work. By piloting pooling methods with researchers with similarly designed cohorts we set the stage to build new consortia to study the health impacts of chemicals, nutrition, social factors, and the gene-environment interactions that underlie childhood disease. Our team has all the requisite expertise in exposure science, biostatistics, child health phenotyping and in cohort management. We have already developed several new methodologies to objectively reconstruct past chemical exposures that precisely estimate exposure timing, allowing researchers to identify susceptibility windows as they relate to child health. Over the last 10 years, PROGRESS has supported 16 NIH grants led by 10 different researchers (including 7 K awardees), demonstrating our ability to serve as an incubator for the next generation of Environmental Health scientists. To accommodate divergent research needs among this group, the PI has formed the equivalent of an Administrative Core that will plan, organize, streamline and prioritize field work by coordinating the associated administrative work (IRB, protocol development, finances etc). We will also develop new programs to assess participant needs in order to improve retention, adapt to advances in social media, assess new health outcomes and exposures, and implement new exposure/response assays as we prepare our cohort for future big data consortia research. This proposal links highly experienced environmental health scientists with statisticians, social epidemiologists, child psychologists, chemists, pediatricians, and epigeneticists to support the infrastructure of a highly functional, state of the longitudinal birth cohort that objectively measures the human environments that program child health. We will follow PROGRESS children up to the onset of puberty, linking fetal exposures to health changes inherent to this critical life stage. Finally, despite our many successes, without this R24, field work will cease and this application is critical to our future success."
"9456216","Project Summary (Abstract) Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common and aggressive primary brain tumor. The infiltrative nature of tumor cells makes surgical resection incomplete. Furthermore, recurrence is inevitable despite radiation and temozolomide treatment and patients die within 15 months following diagnosis. GBM are divided into several molecular subtypes based on distinct gene expression profiles, including proneural (PN), mesenchymal (MES), classical (CL). One important reason that current anti-neoplastic therapies fail to provide a durable response in GBM is the adaptive nature of the tumor microenvironment. The most abundant non-neoplastic cell population in the GBM microenvironment is tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). Of the GBM subtypes, MES expresses the highest levels of TAM-associated genes. Our analysis of TAM numbers revealed that MES GBM also has the highest number of TAMs compared to the other subtypes. When we correlated the high and low expression levels of TAM-associated genes with patient survival in a subtype-specific manner, only PN GBM patients showed a correlation of high expression: short survival and low expression: long survival. PN GBM is also known to be the most resistant to anti-neoplastic cell-specific targeted therapies. To examine TAM-GBM cell interactions, we used genetically engineered immunocompetent mouse models of PDGFB- and NF-1 loss- driven GBM and showed that tumor cells induce TAMs to produce the key pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-1?. TAMs release IL-1?, which binds to the receptor IL-1R1 on tumor cells and leads to activation of IL-1? signaling in PDGFB-driven GBM cells, which leads to i) increased stemness and growth, and ii) increased expression of the monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP) network (CCL2, CCL7, CCL8, CCL12) in PDGFB- driven GBM cells. Our data showed that loss of IL-1? from the microenvironment resulted in a significant decrease in PDGFB-driven GBM formation and growth compared to wild-type mice in vivo. Based on our data, we hypothesize that TAM interaction with GBM cells is cell type- and subtype-specific and that they have different functions in PN and MES GBM subtypes. In this application, we will determine the detailed mechanism by which PN and MES GBM cells recruit and alter the function of macrophages to create specialized TAMs (Aim 1). To determine the mechanism of IL-1? signaling, the MCP network, and their downstream targets in PDGFB- and NF1 loss-driven GBM using genetically engineered mouse models and human GSC-derived tumors in vivo. Determine the mechanism by which TAMs and IL-1? support the creation and maintenance of the perivascular niche, which provides the proper microenvironment for glioma stem cells ? the treatment-resistant population of glioma (Aim 3). The proposed studies will provide new mechanistic insights into fundamental cellular and molecular biological processes related to TAM? tumor cell interaction in vivo, and will allow for identification of novel potential therapeutic targets to glioblastoma."
"9468924","Project Summary/Abstract Postsynaptic density protein-95 (PSD-95) is a highly abundant scaffolding protein located at the dendritic spines of excitatory synapses and is involved in the recruitment, trafficking, and stabilization of N-methyl-D- aspartic acid receptors (NMDAR?s) and ?-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isox-azoleproprionic acid receptors (AMPAR's) to the postsynaptic membrane during synaptic maturation. Previous studies have shown that within the hippocampus, PSD-95 deficiency causes ?silent synapse? formation that may be associated with the pathology observed in the neurological disorders of schizophrenia (SCZ) and autism. However, the effects of PSD-95 deficiency within the prefrontal cortex (PFC), a brain region with delayed maturation, have yet to be investigated. The PFC, located anterior of the frontal lobe, is responsible for cognition, working memory, emotional control, and sociability. It is also highly associated with neurodevelopmental disorders, especially schizophrenia. We hypothesize that PSD-95 deficiency will disrupt synaptic maturation in an age-dependent manner due to an increase in NMDAR/AMPAR-glutamatergic transmission that leads to impairments in PFC development and function. In this study we use a PSD-95-/- mouse to model PSD-95 deficiency and investigate NMDA and AMPA-receptor properties within the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). We explore protein expression levels of NMDAR and AMPAR-subunits and other relevant scaffolding proteins. Additionally, we examine NMDAR/AMPAR-transmission to characterize silent synapses, and accordingly, we will examine working memory function and social interaction to measure social novelty and exploration. Furthermore, based on our preliminary finding of increased NMDA/AMPA ratio in corticocortical afferents, we will examine the major inputs of the mPFC ? the mediodorsal thalamus (MD), which is responsible for the development and function of the mPFC via reciprocal connections mediated by glutamatergic transmission. We further hypothesize that PSD-95 deficiency will impair thalamocortical projections via disrupted glutamatergic transmission, resulting in afferent-specific changes in synaptic function and neurodevelopmental deficits of the mPFC that lead to physiological and behavioral dysfunctions. We will inject an adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector expressing channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) within the MD and use optogenetics to specifically activate MD inputs to mPFC to record excitatory postsynaptic currents. Together, this data will provide a greater understanding of how PSD-95 affects the glutamate receptor composition and transmission as it relates to mPFC development and function."
"9551798","7. Project Summary/Abstract The Research Plan describes a series of experiments that will examine how spatial information is processed in the mammalian brain. In previous studies a population of neurons was identified within the mammillary nuclei ? anterior thalamus ? hippocampal formation axis that discharge as a function of the animal's head direction (HD), independent of the animal's behavior and spatial location. This spatial signal provides a model system for examining how primary sensory information, entering through various sensory pathways, is transformed into a higher level cognitive signal representing the organism's spatial relationship with its environment. The mechanisms that accomplish this transformation in the central nervous system are not known. The first aim contains four experiments and is designed to determine how the HD signal is derived and processed from known sensory inputs. Studies will focus on subcortical areas in the brainstem and mammillary nuclei. The second aim will determine the brain areas involved in generating the grid cell signal in medial entorhinal cortex. The third aim determines how visual landmark spatial information is processed in the retrosplenial cortex and includes recordings from HD cells, as well as an anatomical double-labeling experiment which will better define the anatomical connections in retrosplenial cortex that are involved in processing visual landmarks. The fourth aim addresses the role of two subcortical brain areas that are involved in generating the HD signal in performing a path integration spatial task. In sum, these studies will provide insight into how spatial information is organized and processed in the brain and will enhance our understanding of the functional role of HD cells during navigation. The results will have implications for human health and behavior. It is common for elderly patients and patients with Alzheimer?s disease, a disease often associated with marked pathology in limbic system structures, to experience spatial disorientation to the extent that constant supervision is required. Learning how spatial information is processed in the rat brain will give us clues about the complex nature of spatial processes in humans."
"9448504","Project Summary Motor circuits control fundamental behaviors such as swallowing, breathing and locomotion. Spinal motor neurons are the key mediators translating motor commands generated within the central nervous system to peripheral muscle targets. Motor neurons are activated by a precisely regulated pattern of synaptic activity from sensory neurons, local spinal interneurons and descending pathways from the brain. During early development, synaptic activity received by motor neurons shapes their functional properties. In contrast, gene mutations that induce perturbations in either neuronal wiring or synaptic drive received by motor neurons often result in motor system disorders. A prominent example of this situation is spinal muscular atrophy (SMA)?an inherited neuromuscular disease caused by ubiquitous deficiency in the survival motor neuron (SMN) protein. SMA pathogenesis involves alterations of multiple components of the motor circuit leading to abnormalities in spinal reflexes, motor neuron loss and skeletal muscle atrophy. However, the molecular, cellular and circuit mechanisms underlying SMA remain largely elusive. Our previous work have led us in uncovering novel molecular perturbations involving the downregulation of the delayed rectifier potassium channel Kv2.1 as an important determinant in the regulation of motor neuron firing. In addition, SMA motor neurons are under increased tonic inhibitory originating from pre-motor inhibitory interneurons. Finally, we have identified reduction of neurotrophin 3 (NT3) as a candidate for the selective vulnerability of motor circuits responsible for activating proximal muscles which are more vulnerable compared to distal muscles. In Aim 1, we will study whether increased inhibitory synaptic drive on motor neurons, acting non-cell autonomously, is responsible for motor circuit dysfunction in SMA mice. We will employ mouse genetics together with morphological and functional assays. In Aim 2, we will investigate whether the dynamic downregulation of the potassium delayed rectifier channel Kv2.1 expression through abnormal dephopshorylation is a major contributor for the reduction in MN repetitive firing in SMA. We will use ES-differentiated motor neurons co-cultured with interneurons that have been engineered to downregulate SMN protein levels following antibiotic exposure. In addition, we will use mouse models to determine the contribution of the main three enzymes reported to regulate Kv2.1 expression in neurons. In Aim 3, we will expand on our preliminary studies, which has identified reduction of NT3 in SMA spinal cords early in the disease onset, to determine its relative contribution in the selective vulnerability of motor circuits in SMA mice. Specific and selective upregulation of NT3 in motor neurons or muscles will provide further insights into the source of NT3 impairment."
"9441559","PROJECT SUMMARY Chronic kidney disease (CKD) affects >10% of the adult US population, costs tens of billions of dollars annually, and can lead to progressive kidney failure leading to need for renal replacement therapy. Successful kidney transplant reverses many of the chronic abnormalities in CKD and has shown to improve not only quality of life but also patient survival compared to renal replacement therapy. It is vital to identify strategies that improve and prolong organ function. We have established a multidisciplinary investigative team and outline plans for a multicenter transplant prospective recruiting clinical center for the RFA-DK-16-025 ? ?APOL1 Long- term Kidney Transplantation Outcomes Network (APOLLO) Clinical Centers?, to assess the outcome of kidney transplant recipients and living donors in relation to the African-ancestry APOL1 alleles. APOL1 risk alleles have been shown to explain a large part of the increased risk of African Americans compared to non-African American for end-stage renal disease. However, the association of APOL1 alleles with kidney transplant outcomes such as deterioration of kidney function, acute rejection, and allograft loss as well as living donor health is unclear. We propose to assess if the presence of APOL1 donor risk alleles is associated with kidney transplant outcomes (rate of change of kidney function, rates of acute rejection and graft failure defined as re- transplantation, initiation of dialysis or GFR < 15 ml/min/1.73m2) (Aim 1); to determine if acute rejection, viral infections and other genetic factors in the donor-recipient pair alters the impact of donor APOL1 risk alleles with kidney transplant outcomes (Aim 2); and determine the impact of kidney donation in African American donors with APOL1 risk alleles with up to 3.5 years of longitudinal follow-up (Aim 3). We are committed to collaborative protocol development, sharing best practices, and team science to achieve the APOLLO's objectives. The APOLLO network will also establish a high quality resource (data and specimen repository of blood, urine, DNA, and RNA) for future basic, clinical and translational research in transplantation. The proposed research plan will have future diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic implications. In addition, it could have policy implications as kidneys may need to be allocated in the future taking into account the donor APOL1 genotype."

We propose to use these methods to provide a deep understanding of how the neurons of the hippocampal region generate the sharp-wave ripple (SPW- R). This remarkable signal has been shown to depend on prior learning and to produce high-speed replay of memory sequences (e.g. a path along a track). The function of this signal is memory consolidation; disruption of SPW-Rs results in strong deficits in memory-guided behavior. Because much is known about the hippocampal cell types involved and their network connections, understanding the SPW-R is a tractable target for the first major effort to elucidate the cellular/network mechanism of a mammalian brain signal at an analytical level comparable to that achieved in the study of simple invertebrate systems. Project 1 is aimed at understanding the external and intra-hippocampal pathways that control the initiation of SPW-Rs. Project 2 deals with the events that occur during the SPW-R, including the timing of activity in identified cell types and understanding the fundamental network architecture by which memory sequences are produced. Project 3 deals with how the information that is replayed during the SPW-R is encoded. We will attempt to create an artificial memory and then determine whether the memory is replayed during a SPW-R; we will also interfere with molecular mechanisms of memory storage to determine whether we can erase the memories that are replayed during the SPW-R. Project 4 builds upon recent work indicating that differentially projecting CA1 pyramidal cells have distinct properties and will test the possibility that SPW- Rs in distinct output channels may carry different information and affect different behaviors. In Project 5 we will develop the first non-reduced computational model of the hippocampus, incorporating information about cell types and connections. This will be a major new resource for our group and the research community that will permit unprecedentedly close interplay between experiment and computation. To the extent that the model can account for the experimental observations, we can use it to understand underlying network principles and design interventional experiments to validate this understanding. To the extent that the model cannot explain results, it will help point us to aspects of network function that require further elucidation. Taken together, Projects 1-5 provide a tractable path to a major breakthrough in understanding how a cognitively important brain signal is generated."
"9388274","ABSTRACT Built on the success of collaboration of our multi-disciplinary team of investigators from UCLA Medical center, Jonsson Comprehensive Cancer Center (JCCC), and California Nanosystem Institute (CNSI), we have developed a potentially new cancer diagnostic platform, called ?Mechano- or Nanocytology?. The basic hypothesis is that as the fundamental lethal features of cancer are tumor cell invasion and metastasis, directly measuring the mechanical properties of cells associated with tumor invasion and metastasis may provide an accurate diagnostic and prognostic marker for cancer. Cancer cell mechanical signature including cell stiffness, elasticity, deformability and permeability, among others, can be quantitatively measured in label free manner at the single cell level (S. Cross, Nature Nano, 2007; Gossett, PNAS, 2012; Tsai, Science Trans. Med., 2013; Rowat, J Biol Chem 2013; Qi, Sci Rep 2015), using state of the art technologies such as Atomic Force Microscope (AFM), Deformability Cytometry (DC), and Parallel Microfiltration (PMF). These methods collectively enable robust measurements which can be implemented in a clinical setting. While data from us and others demonstrated metastatic cancer cells show rather distinctive mechanical features to morphologically similar but normal cells, there have been limited studies about how the mechanical changes occur during the multi-step carcinogenic process, or specifically focusing on a cancer type to explore the possibility of using these markers to address specific clinical questions. These important questions are essential for the long-term success of the nanocytology program. In this R21 application, we will study the changes in the mechanotypic profile of cells at various stages of cancer development and progression using a unique in vitro multi-step bladder carcinogenic model (Aim 1), and test the performance of the mechanotypic marker specifically in cytological diagnosis of urothelial carcinoma in bladder irrigation cytological fluid samples (Aim 2). For Aim 2, we will also determine if the mechnotypic markers can be used to distinguishing pre-invasive carcinoma in situ (CIS) from invasive urothelial carcinoma, a question that has substantial clinical implication in determining whether patient should receive cystectomy of not. The study will provide essential preliminary data for our eventual goal of developing the mechanotypic signature as a novel adjunct biomarker for cancer early detection. It also may lead to the development of an entirely new technology platform for quantitative, robust, and accurate determination of cancer cell behavior at the single cell level."
"9318132","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  We propose here our overall plan for the Health Promotion Research Center (HPRC) at the University of Washington for the next five years. One of the original three Prevention Research Centers funded by CDC in 1986, HPRC focuses on promoting healthy aging and reducing health disparities among adults aged 50 and older. Building on our 15 years of experience conducting dissemination and implementation research aimed at scale-up of effective interventions, we plan to focus our work in three areas: cancer prevention and control, mental and physical health of older adults, and workplace health promotion.  Specifically, we will expand the national reach of three flagship healthy-aging programs that were developed and tested by HPRC and disseminated by community organizations partnering with HPRC. First is EnhanceFitness, a group-exercise program for older adults. Since 1999, Senior Services, a Seattle-based non- profit organization serving older adults, has disseminated EnhanceFitness to more than 500 community sites in more than 30 states. It has reached more than 25,000 older adults, most of whom are low-income or members of racial and ethnic minorities. Second is PEARLS, a depression-management program delivered in community settings. Since 2003, Area Agencies on Aging have delivered PEARLS to more than 2,000 low-income, largely fragile and home-bound older adults with depression, through 45 sites in 14 states. Third is Workplace Solutions, a package of evidence-based cancer prevention practices for the workplace. Since 2003, the American Cancer Society has disseminated Workplace Solutions to more than 1,600 workplaces with 6.9 million employees in 42 states.  Scale-up of the EnhanceFitness program, with a focus on reducing race/ethnicity-related disparities in arthritis suffering, will be the objective of our Core Researh Project. In 2011, Senior Services licensed EnhanceFitness to YMCA of the USA (Y-USA), the national-network office for more than 2,700 YMCAs. Because EnhanceFitness decreases pain and increases mobility for persons with arthritis, Y-USA will focus its EnhanceFitness implementation on the half of older adults who suffer from arthritis. Older adults are much more likely to participate in a community-based program like EnhanceFitness if it is recommended by a health care provider, so Y-USA has asked for HPRC's help in enhancing its current, limited approach to increasing provider recommendations for EnhanceFitness participation. To do so, we will first conduct formative research with pharmacists and physical therapists to learn the most effective means of increasing recommendations to a community-based program like EnhanceFitness. Second, we will develop an enhanced approach tailored to obtaining recommendations by pharmacists, physical therapists, and primary-care providers for participation of older-adult arthritis patients in EnhanceFitness at YMCAs. Third, we will conduct a cluster-randomized trial to compare the effectiveness and the cost of the current and enhanced approaches."
"9319036","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The UAB Center for the Study of Community Health, a University Wide Interdisciplinary Research Center, has adopted specific aims to (1) provide a University platform for community-based participatory research (CBPR); (2) engage stakeholders via education and service; and (3) pursue research that enhances community health. Long term objectives are to (1) develop CBPR tools and methodologies; and (2) create a unified community engagement portal for the University. The proposed 5-year prevention project advances these aims and addresses HIV/AIDS, a CDC Winnable Battle. HIV/AIDS prevalence is increasing disproportionately in the Deep South. The project focuses on HIV risk and protective behaviors and suboptimal HIV testing uptake identified in prior research. Goals are to: (1) reach at-risk African American emerging adults living in Birmingham-Hoover, AL neighborhoods experiencing the urban health penalty; and (2) offer population- sensitive and specific HIV prevention programs that are appealing, evidence-based, scalable, and sustainable using modern communication channels to engage individuals and contribute to changed social network norms. The project includes an evaluation of intervention efficacy, upon which an evaluation of intervention diffusion to peer networks is built. CITY Health II will evaluate an entertainment education (EE) intervention to promote HIV testing and protective behaviors and reduce risk behaviors using an integrated phone and web platform. A cluster randomized trial will recruit 700 participants using Respondent Driven Sampling to compare the efficacy of (1) established voluntary HIV counseling, testing, and referral (VCTR usual care control) to be offered at baseline and monthly for 3 months until testing is accepted; and (2) usual care plus 12 weeks of Entertainment Education (EE) serial drama episodes that deliver HIV risk reduction and health promotion messages using an Interactive Voice Response (IVR) system. Participants in the intervention condition will use Twitter to invite network members to listen to EE episodes on a study website. Thus, the study includes a controlled evaluation of EE for HIV prevention while also assessing a key dimension of peer-driven intervention effectiveness (uptake) under real world conditions. Follow-up includes 3 monthly IVR assessments and a 6- month interview. Hypotheses are: (1) Adding a social network intervention to VCTR will improve HIV testing uptake and protective behaviors and reduce risk-taking. (2) The network intervention will change individuals' HIV-related outcomes through changes in perceived norms and self-efficacy/outcome expectations. (3) Intervention condition participants with more media experience and larger networks will benefit more from the intervention, and intervention diffusion will depend on the same characteristics. CITY Health II will advance understanding of intervention efficacy and underlying mechanisms and will contribute to the next generation of HIV prevention approaches by combining an established individual-level intervention with a novel social network intervention. The intervention is peer-driven and accessible, with scalability potential."
"9551998","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):      Many Veterans have lower-limb amputations due to traumatic injuries or complications associated with diabetes and vascular disease. Walking on uneven terrain is unbalanced and uncomfortable for persons with lower-limb amputations because most current ankle-foot prostheses do not adapt their function for different sloped surfaces. This project will examine the  advantages of a new adaptable ankle-foot prosthesis that can adapt to different terrain on every step of walking using only passive mechanical parts (i.e., without the need for motors or batteries). This new system also provides plantarflexion in the late stance phase of walking, which should increase the efficiency of walking. To examine the potential benefits of the new adaptable ankle-foot system, twenty Veterans with unilateral transtibial amputations will be recruited for the study. During the first visit, the prosthetic ankle torque versus ankle angle curves will be measured while the Veterans walk on a treadmill at five surface slopes (-10, -5, 0, +5, and +10 degrees). Subjects will also walk up and over a series of ramps to examine first-step adaptation to surface slopes. A load cell in the prosthesis coupled with motion analysis will allow for the measurement of ankle torque vs. ankle angle as the Veterans walk on the various sloped surfaces. It is anticipated that the ankle torque versus ankle angle curves will shift towar dorsiflexion for uphill slopes and toward plantarflexion for downhill slopes when using the adaptable ankle-foot system. These shifts in the ankle torque vs. ankle angle curve are not expected for similar use of a non-adaptable ankle-foot system (Ossur VariFlex with EVO). In the second and third visits, the same Veterans will walk with both the adaptable and non-adaptable ankle- foot prostheses over a range of speeds and surface slopes while their submaximal oxygen uptake is measured. For each condition (prosthesis/speed or prosthesis/slope), subjects will walk for six minutes on a treadmill, followed by at least ten minutes of rest (or longer if needed to return to baseline oxygen uptake). During the second visit, subjects will walk at three speeds (0.75, 1.00, and 1.25 m/s) with both the adaptable and non-adaptable ankle-foot systems (in a random order). During the third visit, subjects will walk with both ankle-foot systems on three slopes (-5, 0, and +5 degrees) in a random order. The adaptable ankle-foot system is expected to reduce submaximal oxygen uptake compared with the non-adaptable ankle-foot system for both speeds and slopes due to its ability to store and release more energy than current passive non- adaptable ankle-foot systems and its ability to adapt its function on every step to changes in surface slope. Durability testing of the adaptable ankle-foot system will be conducted in parallel with research experiments. The adaptable ankle-foot system will be tested using the International Organization of Standards (ISO) 22675 testing protocol. Design revisions will occur throughout the funding period to improve the durability of the adaptable ankle-foot system. The goal of the development activities is to pass the ISO 22675 test of 2,000,000 cycles of testing without failure. The research and development activities planned for the new adaptable ankle-foot system are designed to provide evidence of the system's ability to adapt to different surface slopes on every step of walking as well as to increase walking efficiency. These activities will provide useful information regarding the design approach used by the current system, while improving the chances for commercialization of the technology for Veterans."

"9565840","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The immediate goal of our project is to understand the role of the extracellular matrix in retinal development and disease. In prior funding periods, we identified unique isoforms of laminins, containing either the ß2 or ?3 chains that are expressed in the eye and brain. Mutations in these two laminin genes, in humans, result in autism, ocular dysgenesis, and kidney dysfunction. Ablation of these genes, in mouse, produce cortical and ocular dysgenesis; the latter includes disruptions of: 1) retinal ganglion cell development; 2) astrocyte migration and subsequent vascular development; 3) the sub-cellular organization of the Müller cell; 4) the photoreceptor- bipolar synapse. Our fundamental hypothesis is that laminins are critical for establishing the three dimensional structure of the retina. Specifically, we hypothesize that laminins provide environmental cues that are essential for angiogenesis and neurogenesis.  Our first aim explores the contributions of laminin signaling in formation of the template for angiogenic development. The working hypothesis is that RGCs drive astrocyte migration; then, interactions between astrocytes and microglia regulate endothelial development. We will use a reverse genetic approach, deleting Lamb2 or Lamc3 genes alone, or together, to disrupt the signaling among these cells. The first set of experiments will focus on the spatial patterning in Lamb2-/- and Lamc3-/- animals. Our second set of experiments will address the role of laminin-mediated recruitment and activation of microglia. The third set of experiments will examine the effectors of laminin signaling in endothelial cells during angiogenesis. Our current data suggest that ß2-containing laminins are pro-angiogenic and ¿3-containing laminins are anti-angiogenic.  Our second aim is focused on the role of laminins in neurogenesis. We will examine the hypothesis that laminin regulates apical-basal polarity of the radially organized progenitor. Our published data demonstrate that Müller cell compartmentalization is disrupted in the Lamb2-/- retina. Moreover, our preliminary data demonstrate that the cell cycle is dysregulated in both Lamb2-/- and Lamc3-/- mice. Our first set of experiments will focus on the regulation of symmetric versus asymmetric division in the Lamb2-/- and Lamc3-/- retina. Next, we will turn to a study of the pattern of inheritance of important cell cycle regulators in these same mice. Last, we will measure directly the cell cycle regulation in Lamb2-/- and Lamc3-/- retina. Our preliminary data suggest that ß2- and ?3-containing laminins are necessary to preserve the proliferative state.  Our work is relevant to an understanding of the pathobiology of retinal neovascular disease, gliosis and proliferative vitreoretinopathy because astrocytes and microglia play critical roles in retinal vascularization and remodeling. Our work on retinal progenitor cells will improve our fundamental understanding of retinal development and our understanding of the regulation of the cell cycle in CNS progenitors and will influence the development of 3D culture systems designed to grow retina ex vivo."

"9439972","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Breast cancer is the most common non-skin cancer among females in the United States (US) and the second leading cause of cancer death in women. Although less than 10% of all breast cancers are diagnosed among women younger than age 45, incidence during the past 30 years has increased faster among younger women than among women older than 40. Although research has recently begun characterizing the economic burden of breast cancer among younger women, the vast majority of the literature on the economic impact of breast cancer has focused on early stage cancers among older women (aged 65 and older). More research is needed to understand the economic impact of metastatic breast cancer among women at all stages of life. Medical treatment for metastatic breast cancer is not intended to ?cure? the cancer but rather to extend the life of the patient and/or improve the patient's quality of life. Several new treatments for metastatic breast cancer have been introduced in recent years. However, more studies are needed that estimate the value of oncology clinical pathways for metastatic breast cancer, as these treatments can be costly with limited survival benefit. The overall goal of this study is to assess the economic burden of metastatic breast cancer across the lifetime and to evaluate the cost effectiveness of alternative clinical pathways for metastatic breast cancer. Our study will estimate the costs of metastatic breast cancer to women in three age groups: younger (aged 18 to 44), midlife (aged 45 to 64) and older (aged 65 and older). We will estimate three types of costs: medical costs, the cost of not being able to work, and the cost of lost earnings from dying prematurely (Aim 1). We will then scale the estimates of the per-person costs to the population level and use US Census projections to project the overall economic burden of metastatic breast cancer out through the year 2030 (Aim 2). Finally, we will estimate the cost-effectiveness of different oncology clinical pathways in the first to third line treatment of patients with endocrine-sensitive, endocrine-refractory or triple negative, and HER2- overexpressing metastatic breast cancer among younger, midlife and older women. While several treatment options for metastatic breast cancer may increase a patient's life, the amount of extra time provided and the cost of the treatment to health insurance and the patient can vary dramatically. When comparing oncology clinical pathways, cost effectiveness analysis provides information about the extra cost per unit of additional healthy life-years gained from choosing one treatment over another. The economic cost data produced by this study will help decision makers allocate scarce public health resources more effectively for the prevention and treatment of metastatic breast cancer. The cost projections can highlight cost drivers for women with metastatic breast cancer and motivate appropriate prevention and early detection public health activities. This study will also identify cost-effective oncology clinical pathways to improve the value of care and health-related quality of life of women of all ages with metastatic breast cancer."

"9446429","Project Summary The scientific premise of this Center is that breast cancer patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models represent the diversity of human breast tumors, and can be feasibly utilized to test new drugs and drug combinations to find therapeutic approaches that match with molecular features of various tumor types. The goal of our PDX Development and Trials Center (PDTC) is to obtain preclinical data that will facilitate prioritization of drugs to be tested in breast cancer clinical trials at the National Cancer Institute (NCI). Toward this goal, our PDTC focuses on testing drugs that are already available through the NCI as NCI-IND agents with the Experimental Therapeutics Clinical Trials Network (ETCTN). Scientifically, this PDTC will focus on preclinical evaluation of approved and investigational drugs and drug combinations in a large collection of breast PDX models representing primary and metastatic breast cancer. One project will screen 35 NCI-IND drugs as single agents and in combination with standard- of-care therapies, in >100 breast PDX models using a novel organoid system, and validate these responses in PDX-bearing mice. Another project will test therapies that are predicted to target tumor- initiating cell populations, with the goal of reducing chemotherapy resistance and recurrence ? the major cause of death from breast cancer. These two synergistic research projects will be supported several key Cores: a PDX Core to propagate the PDX models and run the drug studies; a Biostatistics and Bioinformatics Core to identify molecular features of tumors that do (or do not) respond to various treatments; a Pilot Projects and Trans-network Activities Core to foster exploration of new ideas within the PDTC and in collaboration with the PDXNetwork (PDXNet); and an Administrative Core to facilitate effective communication within the PDTC and with the PDXNet. Taken together, these elements will converge to reveal high-priority treatment strategies for future clinical trials in breast cancer patients."
"9377500","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Iron deficiency (ID), with and without anemia affects an estimated 2 billion people including 40% of pregnant women. ID is particularly deleterious during early-life brain development, leading to significant neurological impairments in children (e.g. learning and memory deficits). More troubling is that the learning and memory impairments persist into adulthood despite iron treatment in infancy, implying that iron therapy alone is not sufficient for full recovery. Thus, the long-term effects of lost education and job potential are te real cost to society of early-life ID. Understanding the iron-dependent molecular/cellular mechanisms that directly cause neurological dysfunction will allow future design of more effective therapies to prevent the long-lasting effects. The newborn brain is highly metabolic, accounting for 60% of total body oxygen consumption. Iron provides the catalytic component for several mitochondrial enzymes required for energy (ATP) production. Early-life ID reduces the energy status of the developing hippocampus, a highly metabolic brain region important for learning and memory. Early-life ID also impairs hippocampal neuron maturation, a metabolically demanding process, leading to reduced dendritic complexity and blunted spine formation in adulthood despite normalization of iron status. However, the molecular/cellular mechanisms contributing to the hippocampal energy impairments and how impaired energy status causes long-term neuronal structural deficits following developmental ID remain unclear. I will test the hypothesis that impaired mitochondrial respiration causes reduced energy status, leading to structural abnormalities in developing iron-deficient and mature formerly iron- deficient mouse hippocampal neurons. I will address this hypothesis through two specific aims. In Aim 1, I will determine the effect of ID on mitochondrial respiration and intracellular trafficking in developing  hippocampal neurons. Key parameters of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation and glycolysis and mitochondrial recruitment to growing dendrites/spines will be measured in iron-sufficient and -deficient hippocampal neurons. In Aim 2, I will test whether restoring energy status in addition to iron repletion attenuates the acute and chronic neuronal structural deficits f developmental ID. Select steps of energy metabolism will be genetically or pharmacologically manipulated in cultured mouse hippocampal neurons, with or without iron repletion, and dendrite complexity and dendritic spine density and morphology will be assessed. This proposal is significant because it defines the role of specific energy metabolic processes in normal neuronal development and determines how a clinically relevant level of ID compromises them, thus providing a mechanistic basis for energy-specific therapies for fetal/neonatal ID. These discoveries and my professional and technical training in neuronal live-cell microscopy, morphology analysis and cellular bioenergetics will form the basis for an independent research career studying nutritional-metabolic regulation of neurodevelopment."
"9565748","Project Summary Dietary Restriction (DR) is the most robust environmental method to slow aging and age-related diseases in species as diverse as yeast, worms, fruit flies and rodents. Research in invertebrates has made invaluable contributions to this field. A novel concept emerging from this proposal is the critical role of the intestine in modulating the protective effects of DR on healthspan through modulating intestinal permeability. Importantly, we identify a novel role for enterocyte cell death in mediating the effects of diet and age on intestinal homeostasis. A growing number of disorders including Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), HIV, colorectal cancer, chronic heart failure, cancer and Parkinson?s disease have been linked to compromised intestinal integrity thus underscoring the importance of the gut epithelium in human health and disease. However, the lack of adequate animal models that mimic gut intestinal disorders hamper a better understanding and development of therapeutics in this area. The complex anatomical, physiological and behavioral characteristics, the relatively short lifespan, and powerful genetic tools that allow the rapid discovery of new genes are some of the unique strengths that make D. melanogaster an ideal model to study how the intestine influences healthspan in response to nutritional variation. We hypothesize that age and a rich diet enhances intestinal permeability and limits lifespan by increasing enterocyte damage and cell death. We observed that inhibition of dMyc, enhances, enterocyte cell death, intestinal permeability, and limits lifespan. Cell competition is an important mechanism by which neighboring cells remove unfit cells to maintain tissue homeostasis. In Aim 1 we will characterize the role of dMyc in mediating cell death by ?cell competition? to modulate intestinal homeostasis. We hypothesize that excessive cell death due to cell competition if unrepaired can cause an age-dependent increase in intestinal permeability. In Aim 2 we will characterize candidates from a genetic screen that has uncovered novel modulators of diet and age-dependent changes in enterocyte cell death. We will characterize their role in cell competition, barrier function, repair, and lifespan. In Aim 3 we will investigate potential mechanisms for age-related changes in gut barrier dysfunction and enterocyte apoptosis. In particular, we will explore alterations in mitochondrial function as a driver of age and diet-dependent changes in enterocyte cell death. As the intestinal biology and the molecular pathways explored in this proposal are well conserved from flies to humans, the insight generated will aid in our understanding of intestinal homeostasis and its impact on longevity and gut function related diseases in humans."
"9317795","SUMMARY Cells divide a fixed number of times, termed replicative lifespan, before they stop dividing and senesce. Acceleration of the alterations to biological macromolecules that characterize the normal replicative aging process predisposes us to shortened replicative lifespan and conditions such as progeria. Despite the fundamental importance of the replicative aging process, there are still huge gaps in our understanding of the biological changes that cause aging and the molecular basis of these changes. Given that the mechanisms of aging are highly conserved across eukaryotes, we use the unparalleled genetic power of budding yeast to gain insight into the molecular mechanisms of replicative aging in all eukaryotes. Using the Mother Enrichment Program (MEP) to isolate unprecedented quantities of old cells, we performed a systematic characterization of the replicative aging process in yeast, with the intention of transferring our discoveries to mammalian systems. Using the MEP, my laboratory has been performing a systems biology analysis of the aging process, really for the first time in any organism. Our genome-wide mapping of nucleosome positions uncovered a global loss of nucleosomes during aging, leading to transcriptional upregulation of every gene in the genome. By deep sequencing of the genome during aging we discovered a global increase in retrotransposition, chromosomal translocation, DNA amplification, rDNA instability, transfer of mitochondrial DNA into the nuclear genome and DNA breaks during aging 1. We have now performed metabolomics analysis and ribosome profiling (Ribo-seq) during aging, leading us to our current hypothesis and goal of discovering the molecular details of how protein synthesis changes with aging, the beneficial consequences, and to leverage this information to extend lifespan and healthspan."
"9551764","ABSTRACT  The ability to selectively focus attention on elements of our sensory environment is a critical cognitive func- tion that enables us to dynamically and flexibly enhance the processing of the most important stimuli, events, and tasks. Likewise, stimulus-reward associations and the potential for gaining reward on a task have also been found to enhance stimulus processing and influence behavior. There has been a growing recognition that these two core cognitive factors ? attention and reward ? interact extensively to shape cognition and behavior. In the next period of this grant, we propose a series of experiments investigating this vital interactive relation- ship between reward and attention. In particular, in Aim 1 we examine how cueing with advance information on locationally specific reward-magnitude potential and classic cueing of locational probability (Posner cueing) proactively shape attentional allocation and task performance. In contrast, in Aim 2 we examine how reward selectively associated with target-relevant stimuli or distractors in a visual-search attention task influences at- tentional and perceptual processes (Aim 2). We also expand our study of the interactive relationship between reward and attention to examine their interactions in audition, thereby also investigating the supramodality of these mechanisms (Aim 3). Lastly, we will also examine how stimulus-reward associations are updated in the sensory cortices by means of top-down modulatory mechanisms (Aim 4). An overarching working hypothesis in these studies is that a key way by which reward enhances task performance is by marshalling attentional control circuits that in turn allocate processing resources in the brain.  We take a highly systems-oriented perspective in these studies: examining both (a) the attention- and re- ward-related cognitive-control mechanisms as they allocate and direct processing resources, and (b) markers of the modulations of those processing resources in the sensory cortices. As before, we will be taking a multi- methodological approach, using a combination of behavioral measures, event-related potentials (ERPs), event- related oscillatory EEG, and functional MRI (fMRI) to delineate the timing, sequence, and location of the under- lying neural processes and interregional neural interactions. Additionally, we will use simultaneous recordings of fMRI and EEG for several of the proposed experiments. Such an approach will enable us to perform trial-to- trial covariational analyses on the data patterns of these two measures of brain activity, providing powerful new ways to link the high-temporal-resolution EEG signals to the associated cortical generators measured in the fMRI. Moreover, the simultaneous recording will also allow us to examine how subcortical brain regions in- volved in attention and reward modulate the functional processes reflected by the cortical EEG ? reflecting crit- ical aspects of processing that cannot be assessed when these measures are acquired separately. Thus, these experiments will delineate with exceptional precision the neural mechanisms by which attentional and reward-related processes interact in the human brain and contribute to adaptive behavior in our complex world."

Ensemble recordings, microcircuit analysis, behavioral measurements and computational modeling will be used to analyze the neural representation of auditory space and the head-orienting movement driven by it. The compact volume of tissue commanding this behavior makes a complete understanding of information processing tractable with high-throughput electrophysiological and microanatomical methods. How information about sound location is readout to guide orienting behaviors has not been demonstrated in any species. This project has the potential to fill this gap. Aim 1 will investigate the relationship between orienting behavior and activity in the neuronal population representing auditory space, in which frontal space is overrepresented. The hypothesis is based on recent work showing that sound localization can be explained by statistical inference, computed by integrating activity across the entire population. Microelectrode arrays (MEAs) will be used to map the activity of the population upon presentation of sounds. Population decoders will be constructed to determine how the population activity is readout to drive behavior. In Aim 2, the network architecture supporting the activity pattern will be studied with light and electron microscopy. Network models will combine the data to explain how connectivity and cellular computations result in the population activity and correlated firing that drives behavior. When auditory-visual cues are modified, the midbrain representation of auditory space adapts over time, and consequently drives a learned behavior. Aim 3 will directly examine this link. MEA recordings, microcircuit analysis and behavioral measurements will be made in owls adapted to prismatic spectacles. Population decoders will be used to test the hypothesis that population activity in the learned condition maintains a non-uniform population code with an overrepresentation of frontal space. Network models will be used to examine how local re-wiring may explain changes in the distribution of activity across the population. This would be the first time that neural activity and network architecture underlying sound localization are approached from the complete-population down to single-cell level, before and after learning. This integrative approach holds potential for understanding principles of population coding, plasticity and learning that operate across species and brain circuits."
"9453787","PROJECT SUMMARY Bangladesh, a country with a lower middle income economy of South Asia, has been experiencing a demographic and epidemiological transition with rapid urbanization and globalization and a gradual increase in life expectancy. In 2002, WHO estimated that about 140,000 Bangladeshis died due to coronary heart disease, which is the leading cause of death in Bangladesh and 70,000 people died of cerebrovascular (or stroke) events, which is the leading cause of sustained disability in Bangladesh. Despite a high disease burden of cardiovascular Diseases (CVD) and death in Bangladesh, there is very little understanding of the underlying population risks and strategies for prevention and treatment of CVD, and shortage of investigators who are able to conduct health-related research relevant to CVD. icddr,b is an internationally renowned organization in Bangladesh and offers an exceptional multi-disciplinary research environment in which scientists and health professionals cooperate on research, treatment, training and policy development. icddr,b proposes to adopt a sustainable strategy for developing scientific expertise and local skills to conduct independent research relevant to CVD through the proposed training under this planning program. The outcome of the application will be to plan a larger training grant of D43, which will be implemented by two partnering institutions, icddr,b and University of Chicago, USA. This project will support a series of technical meetings and workshops as well as virtual activities and communication, to promote interactions among faculty and junior researchers. A Steering Committee will evaluate the project biannually to monitor progress and develop new strategies to improve the training plan. These activities will allow trainees to engage in existing work at icddr,b, in order to acquire hands-on experience in the conduct of research in CVD and will also support the development of new research initiatives and grant proposals under D43 planning grant."
"9446622","PROJECT SUMMARY  The discovery of specific molecular drivers of oncogenesis has led to a shift in the treatment of cancer patients, with a move away from the use of conventional cytotoxic chemotherapy and towards molecularly targeted agents that are often more effective and less toxic (e.g. EGFR and ALK inhibitors and immune- checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapies). However, this success of targeted inhibitors and immunotherapy has highlighted the challenge and importance of drug resistance. While patients often benefit from an initial and profound response to these current treatments, the vast majority of responses are incomplete and result in a residual disease state that serves as a prelude to subsequent tumor progression (acquired resistance). While several studies have delineated mechanisms of acquired resistance to treatment with various targeted inhibitors and immunotherapy, very little is known about the mechanisms underlying incomplete response and residual disease during initial treatment. This is a critical knowledge gap to fill to understand the longitudinal trajectories cancer cells take during treatment to form a drug-resistant tumor that leads to the clinical demise of patients.  In Project 1, we will dissect the basis of incomplete response and resistance to targeted therapy and identify new treatment strategies to neutralize or eliminate residual disease and forestall resistance. We propose to do so through the prism of lung cancer, the foremost cause of cancer mortality worldwide and a paradigm-defining malignancy that illustrates both the successes and challenges of targeted therapy (and immunotherapy). A unique and transformative feature of our project is the ability to capture clinical specimens that include both liquid and tumor biopsies longitudinally from patients treated with targeted therapy (and immunotherapy), both early following treatment initiation and at maximal radiographic tumor response (residual disease). Coupled with our expertise in innovative methodologies such as tumor molecular profiling, genetic and pharmacologic screens, and organoid and patient-derived xenograft modeling, this capability to capture clinical samples from patients with residual disease affords an unprecedented window into the evolution of response and resistance in patients that can be leveraged to therapeutically target the residual disease state to enhance the magnitude and duration of response in patients. We will complement discovery efforts with the focused analysis of candidate modulators of residual disease that we have already uncovered. We propose 2 Specific Aims to characterize and therapeutically suppress residual disease during targeted therapy in NSCLC: Aim 1 will define the molecular portrait and identify therapeutic targets in targeted therapy residual disease in oncogene-driven non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Aim 2 will functionally test the impact of target engagement to eliminate residual disease in oncogene-driven NSCLC patient-derived organoid and patient- derived xenograft (PDX) models."
"9314233","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Early intervention to identify and treat chronic disease and modify behavioral risk factors among women of reproductive age has the potential to significantly reduce their morbidity and mortality and improve their pregnancy outcomes. Lack of health insurance has been a major barrier to early intervention and preventive care among low-income women of reproductive age. However, the 2014 expansion of Medicaid under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) will make millions of low-income women newly eligible for Medicaid and preventive health services. An integrated data system is essential to evaluate the impact of this expansion on the health of women of reproductive age and their infants. Research using this data system will inform future program planning and identify best practices and areas of greatest need. We propose to create an integrated data system that links Oregon Medicaid data with birth and death certificates and hospital discharge data. Further, we will include data on the quality of Medicaid services that are not available to other states. The proposed study is a collaborative effort between Oregon State University and the Oregon Health Authority. Oregon is an ideal state in which to conduct the proposed study because of its ongoing commitment to Medicaid health care delivery reform and the commitment of state leaders to collaborate across divisions and programs to ensure this project's success. The project also has the support of key state stakeholders in maternal and child health and women's health. The specific aims of the proposal are to1) develop a research agenda, in collaboration with key stakeholders, to evaluate the expansion of Medicaid on the health of Medicaid-eligible women of reproductive age, mothers, and infants in Oregon; 2) link Oregon Medicaid data for female enrollees ages 15-44 and their infants to statewide datasets, including (but not limited to) live birth, fetal death, infant death, and hospital discharge data, beginning with 2008 and continuing until 2016, as data become available; and 3) conduct planned analyses and disseminate findings. The research agenda will include key research questions that assess the effect of Medicaid expansion on Medicaid enrollment and access to care for low-income women; utilization of services by women and infants enrolled in Medicaid; general health behaviors, risks, and outcomes for these women; and pregnancy complications and poor birth outcomes. We will also measure disparities that remain after Medicaid expansion, to inform strategies to mitigate those disparities on an ongoing basis. We will use results of these analyses to construct simulations that extend this study's findings into implications and lessons for policy makers and stakeholders in other states that are expanding Medicaid. Results of these analyses and simulations will provide valuable information to support health reform efforts, both in Oregon and across the U.S, to reduce the public health burden and improve population health among women of reproductive age, including pregnancy and infant health outcomes."
"9493286","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Both posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) are prevalent in veterans  from the Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF) and Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF) conflicts [1-4], and have been  associated with cognitive dysfunction, which may lead to functional impairment and poor community  reintegration [1, 2, 5]. PTSD can be highly debilitating not only due to emotional dysregulation, but also due to deficits in the cognitive control processes in areas of complex attention, executive functions and learning [5, 6].  Deficits in these cognitive control functions, important for goal-directed behavior have been linked with difficulties in community reintegration, and educational and occupational functioning in individuals suffering from both PTSD and TBI [7-9]. The combined syndrome of PTSD-mTBI is common, complex, debilitating, and requires special consideration beyond each alone. There is a need for empirically based treatment protocols to address the multiple impairments in returning Veterans with co-morbid PTSD and a history of mild TBI.  Goal-Oriented Attentional Self-Regulation (GOALS) is a therapist administered cognitive rehabilitation training that targets executive control functions of applied mindfulness-based attention regulation and goal management, and links them to participant-defined real-life goals [11]. In a prior study with individuals with chronic brain injury [11], this training has improved cognitive performance in areas of complex attention / executive function, memory, complex functional task performance, and daily functioning. Furthermore, functional MRI results after training indicated significantly enhanced modulation of neural processing in extrastriate cortex and changes in prefrontal cortex [12]. Preliminary results from an ongoing study with Veterans with a history of chronic TBI also support improvements post GOALS on neuropsychological measures of attention and executive function, performance on complex 'real-life' tasks, and self-report measures of functional performance. Furthermore, participants also showed improvement on the emotional regulation self-report measures. These findings suggest that improving cognitive control (attentional self- regulation in particular) may also improve functioning in other domains, including emotional regulation and functional performance in daily life.  The overall aim of this proposal is to investigate the potential effectiveness of a cognitive training program that targets executive control functions of attentional self-regulation and goal management, Goal-Oriented Attention Self-regulation (GOALS), in Veterans with co-morbid PTSD - mTBI and cognitive difficulties.  In a randomized, controlled intervention study design, 54 OIF/OEF/OND Veterans with a diagnosis of PTSD,  history of mTBI and residual cognitive difficulties will participate in experimental (GOALS), and/or active  comparison (Brain Health Education - EDU) interventions matched for time and intensity. Participants will be randomized to start with either 5 weeks of GOALS or EDU training. Those who begin with EDU will cross-over to GOALS, while those begin with GOALS will have 5 weeks of self-driven practice only. Both groups will participate in pre and post intervention measurements at baseline, weeks 5 and 10. Long-term follow-up will be at 6 months. Pre- and post-intervention measurements will include performance on untrained: neuro-cognitive tests assessing targeted and non-targeted cognitive domains, complex functional task performance in  low structure 'real-world' setting, and self-report measures of daily functioning and emotional regulation/heath.  When completed, these studies will inform us whether a functional approach, training core attentional self- regulatory control functions, via personally-relevant activities, will be effective in improving functioning for individuals with PTSD and mTBI. The study design will provide a test not only of potential benefits on real life  functioning, but also determine to what extent the benefits are related to actual changes in hypothetically  targeted cognitive and emotional functions."
"9566429","Project summary: Traumatic injury represents a leading cause of mortality and loss of independence among the growing portion of the US population aged >64y. In 2013, nearly 4 million non-fatal traumatic injuries occurred among older patients. By 2050, the number of individuals aged >64y is projected to double with an anticipated parallel increase in the number of older trauma patients. Traumatic brain injury (TBI) (>425,000/anum) and hip fracture (>258,000/anum) are two of the most common and debilitating injuries occurring among older adults, often resulting in long-term functional impairments, nursing home admission, decreased independence, and shortened life expectancy. Ensuring that older patients receive the optimal level of trauma center (TC) care may be one important way to improve outcomes. While TC care has been shown to significantly reduce mortality in young, severely-injured populations, its effectiveness in improving outcomes among older patients remains unclear. This proposal aims to compare the effectiveness of TC versus non-trauma center care in older patients. We will use 2007-2014 Medicare claims data, along with data from the American Trauma Society, American Hospital Association, and University of Pennsylvania Cartography Modeling Lab (geographic assessment), to understand the unique care patterns and management needs of older injured patients. We will first determine where older patients receive trauma care and identify characteristics (demographic, injury, geography-related) associated with treatment at different TC levels using descriptive statistics and ordered logistic regression. Calculation of injury and comorbidity measures will be conducted through the adaptation and validation of a SAS- compatible version of the ICDPIC program written for STATA to enable use with the most up-to- date Medicare information available through CMS's Virtual Research Data Center. We will then examine possible effects of TC care on outcomes among older patients with traumatic injury, comparing differences in mortality, morbidity, LOS, discharge disposition, readmission, cost, and functional status between patients treated at the highest versus lowest levels of trauma care, at discharge and at 30, 90, and 365 days. Finally, we will identify possible heterogeneity in the effectiveness of TC care and estimate the potential impact of treating older patients at the facility most appropriate for their injury, using multiple interaction proportional hazard modeling, accelerated failure time modeling, and counterfactual techniques (Markov chain/random field modeling). Variations in costs will be explored to determine possible cost saving. Throughout all of these analyses, we will identify subsets of older injured patients who benefit from TC care, specifically focusing on differences between older adults with TBI (expected to benefit from high-level TC care) and hip fracture (thought to be manageable regardless of treating facility)."
"9339743","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There are two overarching objectives of this postdoctoral training proposal. First, the proposed work and training plan will provide a promising young scientist with training in academic research and will provide career development opportunities to facilitate her achievement of becoming an independent scientist. Second, the overall scientific aim is to test a novel approach for improving respiratory motor function after cervical spinal cord injury (SCI) - a life-threatening problem with limited treatmen options and no cure. The proposed studies focus on coupling two novel methods to improve respiratory recovery following a high cervical SCI: overexpression of spinal BDNF using AAV-based gene therapy and intermittent hypoxia. A highly unique feature of the proposed work is the use of a multi-electrode array to record individual spinal interneurons. As a field, we know almost nothing about how the propriospinal network - likely a key part of SCI rehabilitation - is altered following cSCI. Additionally, many therapeutic strategies including intermittent hypoxia and gene therapy are progressing without a clear understanding of the mechanisms by which these therapies modulate the activity of the propriospinal network. Defining the spinal circuitry after chronic cSCI is essential for designing evidence-based respiratory rehabilitation and spinal cord repair approaches. The two specific aims of this proposal are: 1) To test the hypothesis that controlled overexpression of spinal BDNF modulates the activity of cervical spinal interneurons to enhance the excitability of the network and promote recovery following cSCI.; and 2) To test the hypothesis that following cSCI, overexpression of spinal BDNF coupled with IH act synergistically to alter the excitability of cervical spinal interneurons and enhance the efficacy of respiratory neuroplasticity. To test our hypotheses, we will use an established rodent model of cSCI (C2 hemisection; C2Hx) and a multi-disciplinary approach including in vivo neurophysiology, AAV-based technology, multi-electrode arrays, histology, and behavioral outcome measures. If successful, the proposed research will make transformative advances in the approach to treating respiratory dysfunction after cervical spinal cord injury."
"9313622","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Global health organizations highlight engaging men and boys in preventing violence against women as a potentially impactful public health strategy. A gender transformative approach involves altering gender and sexuality norms that foster violence against women while promoting bystander intervention (i.e., giving boys skills to interrupt abusive behaviors they witness among peers) to reduce the perpetration of sexual violence (SV) and adolescent relationship abuse (ARA). This study will test, via a two arm cluster randomized controlled trial, a gender transformative SV/ARA perpetration prevention program titled Boys Care implemented in a community-based setting among African American adolescent males ages 14-17. This is a stakeholder- engaged intervention that involves an 18 hour curriculum divided into 3 weekend day sessions delivered over a 2 month period (at 4 week intervals) in community-based youth-serving agencies (YMCA and Urban League). Control sites will implement an evidence-based life skills curriculum. The rationale for focusing on primarily African American youth in socially disadvantaged neighborhoods is two-fold. First, racial/ethnic disparities in health are stark in Pittsburgh, the setting for this study; prevention efforts in communities with high prevalence of poverty, sexual violence, and poor health outcomes are needed. Second, the prevention educators are from these communities and have high degrees of trust and respect fundamental to building positive youth relationships. Innovations are: first, an intersectional approach combining gender theory, adolescent sexual development, and community-partnered research to evaluate the impact of gender transformative programming on SV/ARA perpetration in socially disadvantaged communities; second, a program that integrates education and skills building around gender norms change with sexuality education theorized to target SV perpetration and increase healthy sexual behaviors; third, a stakeholder-engaged approach in design and implementation to ensure local relevance, feasibility, and replicability; and fourth, use of arts-based strategies to encourage youth to explore masculinities. Via a 2-arm cluster-randomized trial in youth-serving agencies (10 clusters, N=960 adolescent males ages 14-17), this study will assess the effectiveness of Boys Care compared to a life skills curriculum. At the end of the 2 month program (Time 2), compared to controls, youth will demonstrate increased positive bystander intervention behaviors (secondary outcome). Intermediate outcomes are: increased condom and contraceptive self-efficacy; increased recognition of abusive behaviors; increased gender-equitable attitudes; and increased intentions to intervene with peers. Six months after the intervention (Time 3), youth will report less perpetration of SV and ARA toward females (Primary Outcome) compared to controls. This study will provide urgently needed information about the effectiveness of a gender transformative program that combines healthy sexuality skills, gender norms change, and bystander skills to interrupt peers' disrespectful and harmful behaviors to reduce SV/ARA perpetration among adolescent males."
"9469358","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The mouse molar provides an excellent model system for studying epithelial and mesenchymal tissue interactions during organogenesis because of its relatively simple physiology and easy access. Using mouse genetics, scientists have uncovered a number of signaling pathways that regulate tooth formation. Depending on the range, duration, and intensity of the signal, intracellular cascades can initiate different cellular programs for proliferation, differentiation, migration, and survival. The Sprouty family of genes is essential for fine-tuning receptor-tyrosine-kinase signaling initiated by FGFs during tooth formation. While it is known that Sprouty genes act as negative feedback regulators of the FGF-RAS/MAPK and ?RAS/PI3K pathways, the molecular mechanisms that differentially induce Sprouty gene expression and direct divergent cellular responses remain unclear. Mice carrying single and various combinations of Sprouty mutant alleles have supernumerary teeth and display abnormalities in tooth size, shape, and micro-structure. Therefore, I hypothesize that SPRY1 and SPRY2 fine-tune FGF signaling through specific signaling cascades to control proliferation and differentiation of the dental epithelium and mesenchyme, subsequently regulating tooth patterning and morphogenesis. Preliminary results show that Spry1 and Spry2 are expressed in both distinct and overlapping regions of the epithelium and mesenchyme, and loss of function results in the formation of a supernumerary bud, lingual to the first molar. Cultured E14.5 dental germs under kidney capsule in adult nude mice for four weeks demonstrated the potential of the supernumerary buds to form mineralized teeth. Precise characterization of the expression of Sprouty genes and how they alter cell transcriptome and behavior will addressed in Aim 1 using immunostaining, static and dynamic histomorphometrical analyses, and single cell RNA-seq. In Aim 2, the proposed experiments will determine the precise point in the cascade at which SPRY1 and SPRY2 intercept FGF-RAS signaling in molar development. Inhibitors targeting the identified hyper-phosphorylated kinases will be utilized in attempt to rescue the mutant phenotype. This proposed work explores the mechanism whereby Sprouty proteins control tissue- specific interactions during development of the mouse molar. Elucidation of the regulatory network and functional relationship between SPRY1 and SPRY2 and FGF signaling in vivo will advance our knowledge of how Sprouty proteins control tooth organogenesis and lead to novel molecular-based therapies for detection and treatment and, in the long run, to bioengineering of teeth."
"9321805","This project will investigate the efferent pathways, from brain to periphery, through which psychological  factors contribute to the expression, severity and management of inflammation in asthma. In addition, it will  establish the efficacy of mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) training in reducing the lung function  impairment and inflammation associated with exposure the allergen in asthmatic individuals by reducing the  reactivity of emotion-related neural circuitry. We will recruit asthmatic individuals with a dual response to  allergen exposure, who will be randomized to either MBSR training or to a wait-list control group. Participants  will undergo an inhaled allergen challenge and provide measures of pulmonary function and asthma-relevant  inflammation pre- and post-intervention. In addition, fMRI data will be collected during the hour preceding the  onset of the late-phase response. This timing was designed to detect neural signals that may influence the  development inflammation that underiies the late-phase fall in lung function. During fMRI data collection,  participants perform a variant of the Stroop Task, where they identify the color of letters spelling asthma-  related (e.g. wheeze), generally negative (e.g. loneliness), or neutral (e.g. curtains) words. This design is  based on our prior work showing increased activation in affective neural circuitry, specifically to disease-  related cues, in the context of allergen challenge. This increased responsivity predicted the lung function  decline and inflammation associated with the late-phase response that would occur several hours later. The  current design allows up to specifically target the efferent pathways in this bi-directional relationship, by  employing an intervention focused on cognitive and emotional processes. In so doing, we have the potential  to identify an entirely new domain of disease management strategies, such as neurofeedback, geared at  reducing responsivity in specific neural circuits to impact the function of peripheral disease processes. Thus,  our proposed project represents a new paradigm in asthma and holds the promise to better understand the  complexity of this disease, its regulation, and ultimately to provide for more effective treatment.  RELEVANCE (See instructions):  Asthma currently represents and enormous public health burden, affecting more than 10% of the population  in the U.S., and costing tens of billions of dollars in healthcare and leading to tens of millions of missed days  of work. Current treatment strategies are expensive and not fully effective in some individuals. Given the  evidence suggesting that psychological factors contribute substantially to asthma symptom expression, an  intervention that addresses this influence on asthma exacerbation is missing from the current toolbox."
"9290672","PROJECT SUMMARY Corneal transplantation is the most common solid organ transplantation worldwide, and immunological graft rejection is the main cause of graft failure. Corticosteroid eye drops must be applied frequently to prevent graft rejection and rescue grafts that show early signs of rejection, because topically administered drugs undergo rapid clearance and have poor ocular bioavailability. However, long-term, frequent dosing is associated with low patient compliance, and those that comply have risk of increased intraocular pressure (IOP), which can cause glaucoma. We propose a new method for providing sustained corticosteroid delivery at low, but efficacious levels, removing the treatment burden from patients and improving the safety of corticosteroids. We developed biodegradable nanoparticles containing high loadings of dexamethasone sodium phosphate (DSP) that can be administered by the same route that surgeons administer DSP at the end of corneal transplant surgery, subconjunctival (SCT) injection. Further, DSP-loaded nanoparticles (DSP-NP) are coated with polyethylene glycol (PEG) to minimize inflammatory reactions in the eye, and in contrast to topical drops, do not cause an increase in IOP in animal models. Our preliminary results demonstrate that DSP-NP are effective for both preventing and treating early signs of graft rejection in a rat model. Here, our aim is to develop longer- lasting formulations that can safely and effectively prevent and treat corneal graft rejection, for as long as 3 months with a single injection. If successful, this approach would significantly improve corneal transplant patient care and prognosis. In Aim 1, we will confirm batch reproducibility, determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), and assess ocular pharmacokinetics (PK). The two lead formulations will then be tested for dose dependent efficacy for prevention and treatment in our rat model of graft rejection in Aim 2. Finally, we will carry out detailed safety and pharmacokinetics studies of at least one lead DSP-NP formulation in rabbits in Aim 3 to facilitate future development and potential clinical translation."
"9350888","Infants are innately attracted to face-like objects, suggesting that they ?know? what a face looks like without ever having seen one. How does the genome encode instructions for assembling neural circuits that innately recognize specific complex patterns, such as a face? Pattern recognition is critical for much of human behavior and deficits in recognition abilities are associated with numerous disorders (e.g. prosopagnosia, autism spectrum disorder, different neurodegenerative diseases, recent stroke). Understanding the genetic features that specify the development of innate recognition circuits will provide new avenues for treatments of pattern recognition disorders. Presently, such a detailed link between the genome and neural circuit specification remains a fundamental mystery at the intersection of genomics, neuroscience and behavior. To shed light on the problem we need to identify how a genome that encodes neural circuits, which innately recognizing a specific complex pattern, differs from an ancestor that lacked the same recognition abilities. This presents a major hurdle as most examples of innate pattern recognition abilities, such as face recognition in primates, tend to be evolutionarily ancient and as a result very difficult to genetically dissect. The present work proposes to study the genetic changes that have given rise to novel facial recognition abilities in a unique species of paper wasp. The paper wasp, Polistes fuscatus, has highly variable facial patterns that they use to recognize individual nestmates within their small societies. Like humans, faces are special stimuli for these wasps, but their closely related sister species lack specialized facial processing. Dissecting the genetic basis of the recent evolution of innate recognition of faces in P. fuscatus is possible because of its remarkably low genetic divergence with relatives, high recombination rates and small genome size which all facilitate identification of specific genetic changes that encode circuit specificity. The relatively simple brains of wasps further aid the task. The studies will use a combination of imaging of face-selective neurons, comparative developmental transcriptomics within and between species and comparative genomics to decipher the genetic elements involved in assembling circuits that recognize a specific complex pattern. This genome-wide approach will provide an unbiased view of the of loci involved in specifying circuit development and the genomic features encoding information in circuits. Additionally, the proposed work will develop this unique species of wasp as a powerful invertebrate model for the genomics and neurobiology of complex, individually-differentiated social behaviors that are rare among insects but are the cornerstone of vertebrate and human societies. Most importantly, however, this research will contribute to a deeper and richer understanding of how genomes encode the design of neural circuits for specific recognition tasks."
"9470104","Project Summary/Abstract From the unfertilized egg to specialized organs in the adult, the polarization of cells and intracellular structures is a fundamental aspect of animal development. In multicellular tissues, planar cell polarity (PCP) has been extensively studied in epithelia in Drosophila, however, comparatively little is known about the roles of cell polarity in developing mesenchymal tissues in vertebrates such as cartilage and bone. Cartilages composed of polarized stacks of chondrocytes give rise to a polarized progression of endochondral ossification. These stacks form through coordinated intercalation elongation, and differentiation within a skeletal condensation. Previously, we have shown that two PCP signaling pathways, Fat-Dachsous and Wnt-Fz, are required for the polarized stacking and differentiation of chondrocytes in the developing zebrafish jaw. A prominent feature of these polarized stacks that is disrupted in Fat3- or Wnt5-deficient embryos is the position of the microtubule- organizing center within each cell, which marks the location of the primary cilium. This suggests that the primary cilium may serve some specific function(s) during the formation of cartilages. Studies from both mouse and chick further implicate PCP and primary cilia in determining cartilage polarity in long bones. Moreover, defects in Wnt-Fz and Fat-Dachsous signaling cause human diseases. WNT5A or ROR2 mutations cause Robinow syndrome and FAT4 mutations cause Van Maldergem syndrome, both of which include skeletal defects. Similarly, diseases caused by mutations in cilia genes, collectively termed ?ciliopathies,? often present with skeletal defects, primarily affecting the face. These and other data from both mouse and chick suggest that defects in cell polarity underlie skeletal abnormalities including those affecting the craniofacial skeleton. Our preliminary data suggest a role for Hedgehog (Hh) signaling and primary cilia in chondrocyte polarity and for polarity in the formation of ?growth zones? (GZs), which are equivalent to long bone growth plates, and form during endochondral ossification at the sites of polarity reversals. We hypothesize that PCP and primary cilia function together to polarize chondrocytes in developing cartilages to establish sites of endochondral growth and ossification. In Aim 1 we will test novel requirements for the primary cilium and Hh signaling in cartilage polarity in zebrafish by 1) analyzing Fat-PCP and Wnt-PCP signaling responses to disrupting cilia and Hh signaling, 2) creating genetic mosaics with cell transplantation using cilia-deficient bbs/ofd1 mutants and Hh signaling-defective animals to explore cell non-autonomous effects of cilia and Hh on cartilage patterning, and 3) determining roles for Wnt- and Fat-PCP downstream of primary cilia signaling. In Aim 2 we will determine the roles of polarity in cartilage morphogenesis and GZ formation in zebrafish by 1) testing how cartilage polarity and primary cilia pattern GZs, 2) analyzing how polarity and primary cilia influence cartilage responses to Hh, and 3) studying potential cilia-independent roles for BBS9/OFD1 which may affect in cartilage polarity, including mitotic spindle pole orientation and cytokinesis in GZs."
"9552366","Project Summary: Lipid Biomarker Efflux from the Brain following TBI, LaPlaca, M.C., Fernández, F.M. Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a major health problem in the US and worldwide, affecting at least 2.5 million Americans every year. TBI is extremely variable from person to person, making the standardization of injury classification and diagnosis challenging. Biomarkers can potentially provide individualized diagnostic information, yet none are currently approved for clinical use. The objective of the proposed work is to identify novel lipid biomarkers for TBI diagnosis and the routes by which they exit the brain as a function of time and injury severity. The overall hypothesis is that TBI-specific lipids will pass both through the blood brain barrier (BBB) and glymphatic system to the blood post-TBI, and that efflux of biomarkers through different routes will have a variety of post-injury temporal patterns. Lipid biomarkers are promising for several reasons: lipids are abundant in brain, are extremely vulnerable to inflammatory and free radical attack, and may leak out of the brain more readily than proteins, rendering them ideal candidates for peripheral diagnostics. Three mutually- informing aims will be pursued to test the following hypotheses: 1) The absolute magnitude of lipid alterations in brain, blood, cerebrospinal fluid, and lymph will increase with injury severity; 2) More than one route of brain clearance of TBI-generated lipid biomarkers exists and the efflux dynamics depend on lipid size and time post- injury; and 3) Efflux transporters and glymph drainage contribute to post-TBI lipid biomarker efflux in addition to diffusion across brain-to-blood barriers. Preliminary discovery metabolomics data identifying lipids in serum that successfully discriminates between injured and uninjured rats will be expanded to include surveillance in cerebrospinal fluid and lymph out to four weeks post-TBI for mild and moderate TBI in both male and female rats. In addition, different clearance paths will be examined, as efflux routes may change with evolving secondary injury pathology. The route for biomarker clearance from the brain to the blood has been assumed to be primarily via the BBB, however recent identification of dural lymph vessels and a glymphatic route for protein biomarker release after TBI changes the focus from BBB-only transport to one of potentially multiple efflux routes. Given the promise of TBI-specific lipid biomarkers and the unknown dynamics of lipid biomarker release, there is a need to understand lipid clearance routes following TBI. Through this research, we expect to identify novel lipid biomarker panels and determine the major route(s) for their release from the brain. This is significant and novel because, while biomarkers provide a unique window into secondary injury events, changes in efflux patterns directly impact clinical interpretation and implementation."
"9429524","Project Summary: Understanding sleep problems in the Autism Spectrum through Shank3. Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is the most prevalent neurodevelopmental disorder in the US. Several studies have demonstrated that sleep problems occur in ASD at a much higher rate than in typical development. Sleep problems predict the severity of ASD core diagnostic symptoms (e.g., repetitive behaviors and social/communication deficits) as well as other associated problems (e.g., tantrums and aggression). Therefore, understanding the mechanism behind why individuals with ASD have difficulties with sleep holds great promise toward designing interventions to improve quality of life of patients and their families. Study of monogenic syndromes with a high rate of ASD as well as animal models carrying single gene mutations has proven valuable to understand mechanisms underlying ASD. In this context, in my preliminary studies I investigated the role of Shank3, a high confidence ASD gene candidate, in the regulation of sleep. Complete deletion of Shank3 leads Phelan McDermid Syndrome (PMS), a rare disease strongly associated with ASD. Using data on sleep habits obtained from the PMS International Registry, I found that problems with sleep onset are present in >50% of patients. I then performed electrophysiological recordings in Shank3 mutant mice, and found that mutants sleep less than wild-type (WT) mice following sleep deprivation (SD).!Given what we know about how sleep need is regulated, these results can be explained through two alternative hypotheses: 1) Shank3 mutants do not accumulate increased sleep need after SD (they are not as sleepy) or 2) Shank3 mutants do accumulate increased sleep need after SD but have difficulties transitioning from wake to sleep (they are unable to fall asleep when sleepy). The goal of this K01 Career Development award is to obtain additional training and perform additional experiments to differentiate between these two alternative hypotheses as a starting point to an independent line of research. In specific aim 1, I will pursue additional training to investigate the role of Shank3 in regulating sleep need using electrophysiology. In specific aim 2, I will build on previous studies I conducted as a postdoctoral fellow and as a PI to investigate the biomolecular mechanism linking Shank3 with disturbed sleep. My mentoring team includes Dr. John Roll, the Vice- Dean of Research of the College of Medicine, as well as senior scientists from the world-renowned Sleep and Performance Research Center (SPRC) at WSU: Dr. Hans Van Donguen, Dr, Greg Belenky and Dr. Jonathan Wisor. They will ensure the success of my training plan with the environment and resources provided by the College of Medicine and the SPRC at WSU. The proposed training will complement my prior expertise in behavior, molecular biology and genomics to help me establish a research program as an independent investigator that will focus on using genomic and candidate gene approaches to understand the interaction between genes and sleep in ASD."
"9446540","An important contributor to asthma development and severity is exposure to airborne particles and pollutants. Particulate matter (PM) emitted by vehicular traffic is especially harmful in asthma by virtue of its initiation of airway and systemic inflammation and its pro-allergic adjuvant function. We have recently identified activation of the Notch pathway as a key mechanism by which PM exacerbate airway inflammation. PM induces the Notch ligand Jagged 1 (Jag1) in antigen presenting cells (APC), most notably CD11chigh lung macrophages, by an aryl hydrocarbon receptor-dependent mechanism. Inhibition of Jagged 1 induction in lung macrophages abrogates the pro-allergic inflammatory effects of PM. Importantly, PM promote airway inflammation in interaction with the human pro-asthmatic IL-4 receptor alpha chain (IL-4R?) variant IL-4R?-R576, which we recently found to promote dual Th2/Th17 airway inflammation by destabilizing allergen-specific induced (i)- Treg cells into Th17 cell like cells. We have also established that Notch signaling in Treg cells negatively affects their regulatory function. Treg cell-specific inhibition of Notch signaling potently suppresses allergic airway inflammation and its exacerbation by PM, indicating that Notch signaling in Treg cells is a common end mechanism in allergic airway inflammation, which may proceed in synergy with IL-4R?-R576. Fundamental questions remain regarding the Notch pathways activated by allergens and PM, including the identity of the Notch receptor(s) and their downstream canonical and non-canonical signaling pathways involved. Also relevant are other cellular substrates involved, including APCs and innate lymphoid cells type 2 (ILC2). Elucidating the interaction of PM with IL-4R?-R576 in promoting asthma morbidity and severity in human subjects is of particular relevance to therapy and prevention. Accordingly, our central hypothesis is that PM promotes allergic airway inflammation by activating a Jagged1-Notch signaling circuit involving APC, ILC2 and particularly Treg cells. We also propose that selective Notch receptors, most notably Notch4 and possibly Notch3, play a cardinal role in this process, and that a key mechanism by which PM worsens inflammation is by destabilizing allergen-specific Treg cells alone and in synergy with IL-4R?-R576. Finally, we propose to leverage existing asthma cohorts to study the interaction of PM, acting via the Notch pathway, and the IL-4R?- R576 allele in driving mixed Th2/Th17 cell inflammation in asthma by promoting the subversion of newly formed induced Treg cells into pathogenic Th17 cells. We will also relate subject PM exposure and IL4R576 allele carriage to the severity of asthmatic symptoms and inflammation. Our studies will help elucidate novel mechanisms fundamental to the biology of allergic airway inflammation and its augmentation by PM, and illuminate novel pathogenic pathways that could be therapeutically targeted in asthmatic subjects."
"9561420","The retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) is a highly differentiated, post-mitotic cell layer that performs a host of functions critical to retinal homeostasis. To discharge its many functions, the RPE requires ample energy. Studies of cultured RPE cells show that they can derive energy from glucose by either aerobic glycolysis or oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), depending upon culture conditions. However, the balance between these two primary modes of RPE glucose metabolism in vivo is unknown, and it is unclear whether alterations in this balance occur under normal and/or disease conditions. Abundant evidence links changes in cellular energy metabolism with alterations in cell phenotype in a variety of fields including cancer, development, stem cell differentiation and aging. In the outer retina, mutations in mitochondrial DNA that compromise OXPHOS cause macular retinopathy. Moreover, disproportionate damage to mitochondrial DNA has been documented in the RPE of individuals with age-related macular degeneration (AMD), suggesting a causal link. We previously showed that postnatal loss of mitochondrial DNA and OXPHOS capacity in the murine RPE in vivo has surprising effects on cell phenotype, causing activation of cell growth pathways, increased glycolytic flux, and loss of epithelial functions and integrity. Our findings demonstrate that enforced changes in cellular energy metabolism in vivo can drive dedifferentiation and transdifferentiation of the RPE, and support a causal connection between diminished RPE OXPHOS capacity and AMD. However, our results raise new questions about how particular aspects of altered cellular energy metabolism read out as changes in cell phenotype. Can increased aerobic glycolysis alone, in the presence of intact OXPHOS, activate cell growth pathways, cause dedifferentiation/transdifferentiation and loss of epithelial integrity? Are features of the RPE glycolytic phenotype reversible through rebalancing of metabolism? What aspects of the altered phenotype of OXPHOS- deficient RPE result from lack of ATP production via OXPHOS versus loss of electron transport to oxygen? Does diurnal variation in energy metabolism affect the capacity of the RPE to phagocytize outer segment tips? We propose an ensemble of experiments to address these questions. Specifically we will modulate RPE aerobic glycolysis in vivo in the context of intact OXPHOS, restore respiration without ATP generation to OXPHOS-deficient RPE in vivo, and probe the relationship between RPE energy metabolism and diurnal phagocytic capacity. Through detailed characterization and quantification of the alterations in RPE cell phenotype caused by these in vivo metabolic changes, we will uncover mechanistic connections between energy metabolism and RPE cell phenotype. Because we will work in vivo, the impact of RPE metabolic modulation on photoreceptors will be apparent. Thus, success of this project will not only provide foundational knowledge of in vivo RPE metabolism and its relationship to cell phenotype, it will also inform studies of abnormal RPE metabolism in human retinal disease."
"9381189","PROJECT SUMMARY The primary visual cortex has the most accurate map of visual space in the brain and devotes about a square millimeter of its surface to represent all stimulus parameters needed to process a single point in an image. The list of stimulus parameters represented for each point is extensive and includes spatial position, contrast polarity (light or dark), orientation, direction of motion, binocular disparity, eye input, and spatial frequency. Research over the past decades has revealed with increasingly more detail the cortical representation of different stimulus parameters, however, the precision of the current visual cortical maps is still closer to a 150 AD Ptolemy-map of the world than a Google map. We still have a limited understanding of the precise arrangement of different stimulus representations and relations between representations within the map and we still do not know why animals with high visual acuity have cortical maps arranged in intriguing topographic patterns (e.g. orientation pinwheels) that are not existent in animals with poorer vision. Our work over the past years started to reveal the principles underlying visual cortical topography and their possible functional implications. Based on this work, we recently proposed that the topography for all stimulus parameters originate from the arrangement of four different types of thalamic afferents in visual cortex, which convey information about light-dark polarity (ON and OFF) and eye input (contralateral and ipsilateral). The orderly arrangement of these afferents by spatial position, eye input and contrast polarity provides a smooth and accurate map of visual space but at the expense of representing some stimulus parameters more accurately than others (e.g. darks better than lights) and compromising the representation of multiple stimulus parameters when the visual field is large. This proposal takes advantage of novel multielectrode-arrays to map with unprecedented precision the topography of primary visual cortex representing a point of visual space. We combine multielectrode recordings from thalamus and cortex with pharmacological methods and computational modeling to dissect the thalamic and cortical networks underlying cortical topography and the relative contribution of ON and OFF pathways to the structure and function of visual cortical maps."
"9332121","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The SEARCH for Diabetes in Youth Study documented a 31% increase in the prevalence of type 2 diabetes (T2D) between 2001 and 2009, as well as an increase of 21 % in the prevalence of type 1 diabetes (T1D). Increases occurred across most but not all major subgroups of age, sex and race/ethnicity. Further, we documented an annual increase in the incidence of T1D among non-Hispanic White (NHW) youth of approximately 2.7% per year. In contrast, studies from Europe suggest that incidence of T1D may be stabilizing. Thus, compelling questions remain regarding long term trends in incidence and prevalence for both T1 and T2 in youth, particularly among various racial and ethnic population subgroups. Ongoing, efficient surveillance of diabetes diagnosed in youth is essential to inform health care systems and generate testable hypotheses related to the natural history of diabetes in youth. SEARCH is uniquely positioned to address these critical questions through continued surveillance of childhood diabetes employing our well-established infrastructure for surveillance, and its highly experienced, collaborative and multi-disciplinary investigative team. Therefore, in response to RFA-DP-15-002, Component A, we propose the continuation of the SEARCH for Diabetes in Youth Registry Study (SEARCH Phase 4) during which we will continue to ascertain newly diagnosed incident diabetes cases throughout the study period and one additional prevalent cohort (index year 2017) for youth age < 20 years across our five well-established geographically dispersed Study Centers. Our approach is informed by our substantial accrued experience that allows us to conduct surveillance work in a highly efficient manner. We frame our surveillance as an innovative three-tiered approach, starting with the most broad based and cost efficient approach at the highest tier (tier 1) and becoming the most focused in tier 3, with each tier optimizing use of electronic health records (EHRs). Specific Aims are: Aim 1: TIER 1 SURVEILLANCE (Prevalence)- To ascertain cases of prevalent diabetes in calendar year 2017 among youth age < 20 years at diagnosis; Aim 2: TIER 2 SURVEILLANCE (Incidence)- To continue to ascertain newly diagnosed (2015-2020) incident diabetes cases in youth age < 20 years; Aim 3: TIER 3 SURVEILLANCE (Clinical Characteristics) - To confirm classification of diabetes type using biochemical markers, to describe selected clinical characteristics at diagnosis, and to maintain an infrastructure that facilitates the development of more detailed ancillary studies by storing biological samples and preserving contact with potential study participants; Aim 4: OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCY: To optimize efficiency of the SEARCH Surveillance activities through targeted development and validation projects designed to utilize relevant electronic health data to operationalize each of the three tiers of surveillance. Thus, the well-established and highly productive SEARCH team is uniquely positioned to provide critical information on the prevalence, incidence and early clinical course of diabetes in youth."
"9348118","Project Summary/Abstract Mitochondrial dysfunction causes mitochondrial diseases and is tightly linked to aging and neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's. Recent discoveries support that mitochondrial dysfunction can be overcome to treat age-related decline. Cytegen's hypothesis is that exercise induces the secretion of blood- borne proteins that act systemically to stimulate removal of damaged mitochondria and enrichment of healthy mitochondria (mitochondrial fitness). The company's goal is to identify these proteins to develop into biologics that would serve as a platform to treat the myriad of diseases associated with mitochondrial dysfunction. The discovery platform builds on existing work that exercise reversed mitochondrial dysfunction in a mouse model for mitochondrial disease. Cells derived from the mutant mouse offer an attractive tool for identifying factors that improve mitochondrial fitness. In this application, the feasibility of a cell-based assay platform is tested. This platform measures colony formation, mtDNA copy number, mitochondrial respiration, and expression of mitochondrial quality control proteins, and will be evaluated in Aim 1 using known agonists of mitochondrial biogenesis [bezafibrate and the glitazones (PPAR agonists); metformin and AICAR (AMPK); and resveratrol (Sirt1)]. The results will be integrated to develop a fitness score for each agonist. Whether the assay platform is capable of rapidly differentiating agonists' impact on mitochondrial biogenesis by their fitness score will be determined. The utility of the assay platform for discovery of secreted factors will be evaluated in the second aim. At least one factor identified by Cytegen to be significantly upregulated in exercised, not sedentary, mutant mice will be recombinantly produced and tested in the assay platform. The fitness score will be compared to controls. The completion of this work will identify to what extent the assay platform can be used for discovery purposes. If successful, this platform will help identify substances that enhance mitochondrial fitness that can be further pursued in a Phase II application for ultimate translation into clinical trials."
"9195509","Summary Chronic alcohol consumption leads to gut injury and increased incidence of gastrointestinal cancers. Studies have implicated quantitative and qualitative alterations of gut microbiota as well as dysregulation of tight junction proteins as key contributors to gut injury, leading to increased gut permeability. This in turn results in the translocation of bacteria and bacterial endotoxins into the portal blood flow that stimulate the production of pro-inflammatory mediators in the liver, culminating in alcoholic liver disease and other organ damage. However, our understanding of the mechanisms underlying these pathologies remains incomplete. Studies to date have not exhaustively identified ethanol-induced changes in gastrointestinal mucosal gene expression or specific microbial shifts that are responsible for tissue injury. The gut barrier is tightly regulated through interactions between epithelial cells, immune cells, and the microbiome. Deeper understanding of the interplay among these three components in the mucosa is necessary to identify processes of alcohol-induced gut injury. In this application, I will simultaneously define ethanol-mediated changes in the intestinal microbiome and mucosal gene expression within all major sections of the gut (duodenum, jejunum, ileum, and colon) using a translational nonhuman primate model of voluntary ethanol self-administration. This unique animal model provides us with an unprecedented opportunity to investigate region- and dose- dependent alterations in gut homeostasis under the influence of alcohol. Completion of these studies will provide us with the knowledge necessary to design interventions to repair mucosal injury and improve health outcomes in those with alcohol use disorders."
"9327704","Project Summary/Abstract The best available treatments for fear-based disorders, exposure-based therapies, are vulnerable to relapse through the return of fear. This application will test an intervention that may prevent the return of fear. The Rescorla-Wagner model of associative learning posits that repeated experiences of prediction error (i.e., mismatch between expectancy of US and its non-occurrence) extinguishes conditional fear responses 4. In contrast, the ?valuation-based? model of emotion regulation emphasizes cognitive change that modulates the evaluation of a fearful stimulus from ?bad for me? to ?not bad for me?. While interventions from both models are often used together, there has been theoretical debate as to whether such combinations are advantageous or disadvantageous 6. According to the Rescorla-Wagner model, the more intense the US, the more likely its absence during extinction trials will elicit prediction error, which in turn enhances the formation of a CS-noUS memory important for extinction and preventing the return of fear. Measures taken to reduce US intensity prior to extinction training, such as using cognitive reappraisal strategies, limits prediction error. In contrast, valuation-based models of emotion regulation posit that ?not bad for me? cognitive appraisals more strongly reduce emotional responding relative to experience-based learning alone. Neurobiological data suggest that both reappraisal and extinction training increases activation in vmPFC-vACC, indicating that the two processes may complement each other. An extension of the Rescorla-Wagner model, called the computational implementation model, explains how this complementation may come about. It posits that emotional responding is determined by prediction error and the cognitive costs required for regulation. Thus for reappraisals to complement extinction, they should be designed such that the cognitive costs are minimized, and prediction error be preserved. The current application tests this perspective in a series of four studies. Study 1 will examine the neural overlap between reappraisal and extinction learning. Participants will undergo extinction training while in the fMRI scanner and then complete a test of trait reappraisal use. Their performance in the reappraisal task will then be correlated with vmPFC-vACC activation. Studies 2-4 will examine the impact of combining reappraisal with extinction training experimentally to prevent the return of fear. Experiments combine an extinction learning paradigm with either an instructed reappraisal, instructed suppression, or an instruction to the participant to react naturally. Effects will be evaluated in terms of fearful responding after a period of one week under four return of fear conditions: spontaneous recovery (Studies 2-4), rapid reacquisition (Study 2), reinstatement (Study 3), and context renewal (Study 4). These studies will be the first to characterize and test a theoretically potent combination of reappraisal and extinction training. The outcome of this research will provide insight into improving clinical decision-making and maximizing the effectiveness of treatments such as exposure and cognitive restructuring for fear-based disorders."
"9349129","Project Summary Receptor-ligand interactions on cells mediate cell-cell and cell-environment communications in many biological processes. Adhesion frequency assay has unique capability of measuring the receptor-ligand interactions at the single-cell level. The measurement can provide important information on the quality of biological processes and for the selection of potent therapeutic cells. Current adhesion frequency assay uses micropipettes to aspirate cells for both interaction measurement and cell transfer afterwards. As a result, it is bulky, labor-intensive, manual- operative, and low-throughput. In order to maximize the potential of adhesion frequency assay in biomedical research and clinical applications, it is necessary to develop high-throughput miniature device. In view of the tremendous potential and challenges in developing high-throughput miniature adhesion frequency assay, I propose a transformative technical route ? on-chip multiplexed adhesion frequency assay ? that will seek to synergize optical manipulation and microfluidics. I will bring in new ideas from different areas, including optical manipulation, optical imaging, microfluidics, cellular biology, and device physics for development, validation and applications of the proposed assay. Specifically, I will (1) address multiplexed-measurement and cell-sorting challenges in the implementation of the assay, (2) characterize, validate and optimize the pre- packaged assay, and (3) assemble and package the assay into a compact device and apply it to screen cells for disease therapy. With the unprecedented capabilities of measuring the receptor- ligand interactions and sorting cells, the proposed assay will change current paradigm of cell profiling and incorporate one of the most important parameters for quantifying cell functions into routine assays. Once fully developed, the on-chip multiplexed adhesion frequency assay will fill many unmet needs in both biomedical research and clinical applications of the receptor-ligand interactions on cells."
"9564271","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Bladder cancer kills 15,000 annually and because of few therapeutic advances there is a need for innovation. This project has discovered suppressors of bladder tumor growth and metastasis and shown that low expression of AGL, an enzyme involved in glycogenolysis, and RhoGDI2, an inhibitor of multiple GTPases, is associated with cancer recurrence and death. The Goal of this continuation project is to understand how reduced AGL levels result in aggressive bladder cancer and to translate this knowledge into novel therapies. We found bladder cancer cells with low AGL express elevated levels of Hyaluronic Acid (HA) synthase 2 (HAS2), and its extracellular product HA, and have activated RhoC and Rac1, known drivers of tumor progression. We demonstrated RhoC/Rac1 activity is suppressed by RhoGDI2, linking the actions of the two metastasis suppressors. Cells with low AGL also exhibit increased glycolysis, glucose import and autophagy. When either glucose import or autophagy are blocked, low AGL tumor cells show greater reduction of in vitro growth than cells with higher AGL levels, exposing a vulnerability of these aggressive cells. These data support an innovative Hypothesis: Tumor cells with low AGL generate growth and metastatic signals via production of HA, activation of its receptors CD44 and RHAMM, and downstream effectors such as RhoC and Rac1. For these signals to be actualized, sufficient energy needs to be provided via enhanced glucose import and autophagy. Three Specific Aims will test this hypothesis. 1) Evaluate impact of HA signaling on aggressiveness of bladder cancers with low AGL. We will determine if HA drives tumor progression via its receptors CD44 and RHAMM and effectors RhoC and Rac1 that are inhibited by RhoGDI2. Experiments will use RNAi and receptor inhibition in human xenografts. 2) Determine role of the AGL signaling network in bladder cancer development and progression. We will evaluate the independent predictive value of tumor suppressor genes and components of the AGL signaling network in a large panel of annotated human tumors, to define a predictive multigene biomarker signature and possible new therapeutic targets. We will use full and conditional (bladder urothelium) AGL knockout mice in a chemical carcinogenesis model that generates spontaneous visceral metastases to test whether lack of AGL makes urothelium more susceptible to carcinogenesis and resulting tumors more aggressive. 3) Target molecular vulnerabilities of bladder cancers with low AGL expression. Here we test whether blocking glucose import and/or autophagy reduces in vivo bladder tumor growth. We will use shRNA and pharmacologic agents already in preclinical/clinical testing. We will screen shRNA libraries to metabolic and autophagy genes in cells with low AGL to discover novel genes essential to the aggressive tumor phenotype, with the expectation that some of these will become therapeutic targets. We will evaluate combined inhibition of HA signaling and energy production pathways with the expectation this will have synergistic detrimental effects on tumor progression. Impact: This project will lay the foundation for future biomarker-driven personalized clinical trials that target critical vulnerabilities in bldder cancer while informing us on how AGL executes its unanticipated role in cancer."
"9348401","Despite the considerable efforts of the VA to improve awareness of mental health problems and access to care, many returning veterans still report substantial barriers to seeking traditional mental health care. There is a large body of evidence demonstrating that aerobic exercise effectively improves many outcomes relevant to Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) including; anxiety, depression, insomnia, cognition, and cardiovascular disease. In addition, there is a rapidly growing evidence base showing that aerobic exercise produces an increase in the growth of new neurons (e.g., neurogenesis) and increases the volume of the hippocampus which underscores the potential value of exercise for producing broad benefits to psychological health. Recognizing the promise that exercise might hold for attracting more veterans into care and improving overall health in veterans with PTSD, a team of investigators at the San Francisco Veterans Administration Medical Center (SFVAMC) with funding from the Department of Defense developed a treatment protocol and completed a pilot study of Integrative Exercise (Aerobic exercise and Breath Training 3 weekly sessions over 12 weeks) versus a waitlist control condition. Promising results from this trial have led us to the next step which is to conduct a definitive efficacy study of Integrative Exercise versus an active health education control condition: Illness Management and Recovery (IMR). The control condition will be matched on contact hours with treatment personnel. The goal of this revised proposal is to test if Integrative Exercise improves overall quality of life, PTSD symptoms, sleep quality, and measures of cardiovascular health in combat Veterans with chronic PTSD relative to the IMR condition. Another goal is to test if improvements in quality of life are predicted by improvements in cardiovascular fitness as measured by exercise capacity on treadmill testing. Finally, the proposal will test if Integrative Exercise versus IMR will produce greater improvements in additional health outcomes, including mood, subjective sleep quality, and PTSD symptoms."
"9444097","Project Summary Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a Gram-negative opportunistic pathogen that is problematic for individuals who are immunocompromised. Importantly, P. aeruginosa is responsible for pathology associated with chronic colonization of individuals with cystic fibrosis. The organism is well adapted to health care settings by being able to survive on minimal nutrients, form microbial communities on surfaces and express intrinsic resistance to antibiotics and disinfectants. P. aeruginosa has a large repertoire of destructive enzymes and toxins that aid bacterial replication by neutralizing innate immune cells in human hosts. The mechanisms of action include interference with or inhibition of signal transduction, host protein synthesis, cytoskeletal function or membrane dynamics. Our studies focus on the cytotoxic enzymes or effectors injected by the type III secretion system of P. aeruginosa. These enzymes, ExoS and ExoU, demonstrate broad substrate specificity and can recognize both prokaryotic and eukaryotic targets. The property of broad substrate specificity requires that additional control elements must be in place to keep the effector inactive before delivery to the appropriate host environment. The type III effector, ExoU, a potent phospholipase, is used as a model system to study the dynamic changes that mediate activation of enzyme activity in host cells. We identified ubiquitin (Ub), which is synthesized only by eukaryotes, as the activator required for ExoU- mediated phospholipase activity in host cells. The long-term objectives of this research are to mechanistically describe Ub and substrate induced conformational changes that occur to activate ExoU. We have used molecular modeling, continuous wave and double electron electron resonance spectroscopy to build an initial model of ExoU activation. The model makes specific predictions and provides testable hypotheses that will be challenged in iterative biochemical and biophysical analyses and model refinement with novel mono- and diUb probes. Ub-mediated activation is postulated to serve as a specific, therapeutic target, not limited to ExoU. This property extends to ExoU-orthologs that are encoded in the genomes of a variety of Gram negative human pathogens and opportunists. Overall, these studies aim to contribute a structure-function basis for the rational design of inhibitors that may be applicable for treatment of infections caused by resistant, problematic organisms."
"9444923","Project Summary/Abstract The overall purpose of this application is to evaluate the efficacy of an intervention designed to decrease health disparities in pregnant, emotionally distressed minority women. This randomized controlled trial will test a six session (spaced over 18 weeks) cognitive behavioral skills building (CBSB) prenatal care intervention (specifically designed and based on prior research for pregnant minority women experiencing emotional distress) at two sites. To meet the specific aims of this study we will: Specific Aim 1. Use a RCT to evaluate the short- and more long-term efficacy of the COPE-P program to improve healthy lifestyle behaviors (nutrition and exercise), psychosocial health, and birth and post-natal outcomes in pregnant emotionally distressed minority women as compared to an attention control group.  Hypotheses 1a (primary outcomes). Immediately after the COPE-P program, at 4-6 weeks postpartum (3 months post intervention), and at 6 months postpartum (8 months post intervention), COPE-P participants will report higher healthy lifestyle behaviors, and less anxiety, stress and depressive symptoms than will the attention control participants.  Hypothesis 1b (secondary outcomes). COPE-P participants will demonstrate more appropriate pregnancy weight gain, better birth outcomes (mode of delivery, birth weight, and gestational age), more appropriate postpartum weight loss, and better breastfeeding outcomes than attention control participants. Specific Aim 2. Examine the role of cognitive beliefs and perceived difficulty in leading a healthy lifestyle in mediating the effects of the COPE-P program on healthy lifestyle behaviors and psychological symptoms in minority pregnant women.  Hypothesis 2 (theory building exploratory). The effects of the COPE-P program on participants' healthy lifestyle behaviors and levels of anxiety, stress and depressive symptoms will be mediated by beliefs about their ability to make healthy lifestyles choices and their perceived difficulty in leading a healthy lifestyle. Exploratory Aim. Explore characteristics that may moderate healthy lifestyle behaviors, psychosocial health, and birth and post-natal outcomes (e.g., race/ethnicity, income, age, parity, language, level of education, marital status). There is an urgent need to develop and evaluate theoretically-driven, culturally appropriate coping interventions that can be embedded in routine prenatal care and be widely scaled if found to be efficacious."
"9412650","Alzheimer's disease is the most common neurodegenerative disorder and is characterized clinically by cognitive dysfunction and pathologically by the formation of extracellular amyloid plaques and intraneuronal deposition of aggregated tau into neurofibrillary tangles. Aging is arguably the most important risk factor predisposing to the development of Alzheimer's disease and significant evidence implicates protein homeostasis, or proteostasis, failure as a key mechanism underlying age-related disease risk. However, the mechanistic basis for impaired proteostasis with advancing age remains incompletely understood. Recently work in model organisms has demonstrated cross talk between peripheral tissue proteostasis and misfolding and abnormal aggregation of proteins in the central nervous system, but the molecular and cellular mechanisms contributing to tissue-level proteostasis regulation are largely unknown. Here we capitalize on a recent unbiased forward genetic screen in Drosophila, which implicated multiple novel cellular pathways in age-related proteostasis failure and neurodegeneration. We have further determined that a number of novel proteostasis identified in the screen act in a non-cell autonomous fashion to regulate brain proteostasis. Based on these results we will expand our studies to define, using powerful model organism genetics, the range of pathways in peripheral tissues capable of altering brain proteostasis. We will further determine if peripheral manipulation of proteostasis through genetic manipulation of these pathways influences neurodegeneration in experimentally tractable Drosophila models related to Alzheimer's disease, namely tau and Aß transgenic flies. Finally, we will analyze tissue from aging mice, as well as from Alzheimer's disease patients and controls, to ensure that the insights we develop from our powerful, but simple, model organism are relevant to the disease itself. These studies will ultimately expand the array of molecular and cellular targets available for therapy development in Alzheimer's disease and related disorders."
"9327203","Abstract  The  majority  of  chronic  bacterial  infections  have  been  attributed  to  biofilm  formation.  Biofilm  formation  is  a  conserved  physiological  process  during  which  bacteria  become  sessile,  secrete  a  protective  extracellular  matrix and function as a community, rather than as single cells. It is an adaptation mechanism, which starts  with  environmental  cues  that  are  transduced  via  cell  signaling  pathways  and  ultimately  translated  into  changes  in  cellular  behavior.  The  dinucleotide  second  messenger  c-­di-­GMP,  together  with  the  enzymes  for  its production and degradation, has been identified as the major intracellular signaling molecule that controls  biofilm formation and virulence in many bacterial species. Many microbes encode a large number of enzymes  involved  in  c-­di-­GMP  metabolism  and  receptors  for  c-­di-­GMP-­dependent  responses,  and  this  number  often  scales with the adaptation potential of the organism. The prevalence and organization of c-­di-­GMP signaling  networks  suggests  that  mechanisms  exist  to  ensure  signaling  specificity,  although  this  hypothesis  has  not  been explored in great detail. Here, studies will focus on the regulation of a conserved signaling network that  controls cell adhesion in a wide range of bacteria, including several major human pathogens. Central to this  regulatory  node  is  a  transmembrane  c-­di-­GMP  receptor  with  a  prevalent  domain  organization  and  the  enzymes  that  control  its  activity.  Preliminary  data  indicate  that  this  system  is  ideal  to  study  a  major  open  question in the field: How is c-­di-­GMP signaling specificity achieved in signaling networks containing dozens  of  proteins  with  identical  catalytic  activities?  We  address  this  question  several  ways  by  focusing  on  the  conserved,  membrane-­bound,  HAMP  domain-­containing  c-­di-­GMP  receptor  LapD.  We  explore  how  protein-­ protein  interactions  between  this  receptor  and  c-­di-­GMP  metabolizing  enzymes  help  confer  specificity.  Through these studies we also address how c-­di-­GMP signaling is controlled across the cell membrane, and  how  this  protein  family,  comprised  of  >2000  HAMP-­GGDEF-­EAL  domain-­containing  proteins,  is  regulated.  Finally,  we  utilize  mass  spectroscopy-­based  proteomics  approaches  to  systematically  identify  c-­di-­GMP-­ relevant protein networks. These studies will be complemented by the elucidation of specific responses and  signaling  networks  responsive  to  physiological  inputs,  foremost  nutritional  sources.  Together,  the  proposed  studies have the potential to reveal broadly relevant molecular mechanisms that are fundamental to c-­di-­GMP  signaling  and  biofilm  formation.  Considering  the  central  role  of  this  process  in  infectious  diseases,  it  is  well  accepted  that  understanding  the  underlying  mechanisms  may  enable  the  development  of  innovative  strategies  to  manage  and  treat  chronic  infections.  Thus,  the  work  described  here  will  provide  molecular  blueprints that can be used in the design of new, targeted therapies.       "
"9338038","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In September 2010, New York became the fourth state to perform newborn screening for severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) by quantifying T-cell receptor excision circles (TRECs). There are several types of SCID, which are caused by mutations in many different genes, but have a common feature of low or absent functional T-cells. TRECs are a unique DNA byproduct formed during the normal process of T-cell production. TREC quantification can be used for SCID newborn screening because low or absent TRECs may be indicative of an underlying T-cell deficiency, including SCID and other immune disorders. The validity of the TREC assay for identifying infants with classic SCID has been well established. However, the feasibility and usefulness of a second tier next generation sequencing assay has not been studied. After obtaining informed consent, the goals of this project include identification of the specific genes and mutations in infants with low TRECs, tracking their clinical outcomes and developing materials for patient education. Mutation analysis of several genes that are known to cause SCID will be performed using two next generation sequencing platforms. Patient data will be collected to determine whether the genotype data is important for the diagnosis, genetic counseling and resulting clinical care of infants being evaluated for SCID. The outreach and education component of this project will include organizing a group of parents whose infants screened positive for SCID, and using their unique perspective to create educational resources. This project is relevant on a national level because states continue to add TREC analysis to their newborn screening panels. At the conclusion of this project, a model for other states to perform cost- effective gene analysis will be presented. The project will also enable collection of quality assurance specimens to assist the CDC in its goal to provide states with materials for test development and ongoing quality assurance and quality improvement."
"9567490","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Disrupted cilia function in humans results in profound brain abnormalities and cognitive impairments. However, little is known about the molecular mechanisms underlying the brain malformation in this class of disease, called ciliopathies. Recessive mutations in ARL13B or INPP5E cause Joubert Syndrome and Related Disorders (JSRD), a human ciliopathy defined by a specific hindbrain abnormality, the molar tooth sign. Here, we propose to use mouse models of JSRD causing genes (Arl13b, Inpp5e) and their JSRD-causing human mutations to systematically delineate the mechanistic underpinnings of the brain malformations in JSRD. Towards this goal, we will functionally characterize the cilia-dependent and/or cilia-independent signaling mechanisms triggered by ARL13B or INPP5E gene mutations that lead to hindbrain abnormalities. The outcomes of this work will define the role of primary cilia signaling during neuronal development and connectivity. Importantly, delineation of molecular cascades and neurodevelopmental pathways, whose disruptions are integrally related to the development of brain malformations in ciliopathies will enable us to devise optimal diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for these brain disorders."
"9441096","ABSTRACT The ever-widening gap between the need and availability of kidneys for transplantation remains a major challenge to the goal of transplanting all whom may benefit from it. The kidney transplant waiting list is further burdened by patients seeking a repeat transplant due to premature transplant loss. Given this mounting challenge, it is imperative that we use the limited available kidneys more efficiently by matching recipient and transplant organ longevity and by minimizing discard of marginal kidneys that could be used in better suited patients. The Kidney Donor Profile Index provides an estimate of kidney quality and African American (AA) donor race is a variable associated with poorer outcomes. In the general population, AAs are more likely to develop chronic kidney disease (CKD) than individuals of other races. Recent observational studies suggest that high- risk APOL1 genotype variants (HR-APOL1), found exclusively in AA, accounts for 70% of this increased risk. Only a subset of AAs carrying HR-APOL1 develop CKD. In transplantation, recent studies and our preliminary data suggest that kidneys from AA donors with HR-APOL1 are at a greater risk for graft loss compared to donors with low risk APOL1 variants (LR-APOL1). Similar to APOL1-asscoiated CKD, only 20-30% of HR-APOL1 kidneys fail within 2 to 3 years of transplant. It appears that HR-APOL1 genotype alone does not predispose to graft loss but in the presence of a ?second hit? they fail prematurely. At the same time, recent data suggests that AA live kidney donors are more likely to develop CKD than non-AA donors. It is possible that AA living kidney donors carrying HR-APOL1 are at increased risk for post-donation CKD. To further elucidate the role of donor APOL1 on recipient graft and living donor outcomes we propose to assemble a cohort of kidney transplant recipients, from living or deceased donors with African ancestry and address the following specific aims: 1) We will determine if either HR-APOL1 genotype in the donor kidney or the recipient associates with greater kidney transplant function decline and graft loss when compared to recipients of LR-APOL1 kidneys; 2) To collect longitudinal clinical data and biological samples from AA donor kidney transplant recipients to evaluate transplant related immune- and non-immune ?second hit(s)? candidates that trigger early graft dysfunction and failure in recipients of kidneys from HR-APOL1 donors; and 3) To prospectively collect pre- and post-donation clinical and laboratory data from AA living kidney donors to determine if HR-APOL1 genotype associates with lower pre- donation kidney function and greater post-donation kidney function decline, and albuminuria compared to LR- APOL1 donors. Our consortium is ideally positioned to undertake this study as it brings together a large cohort of study participants, including Caribbean-Latinos, a group of investigators with complementary expertise, and state-of-art research facilities. Determining the impact of donor APOL1 gene variants on recipient and donor outcomes will improve our ability to care for this population."
"9312672","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Reducing obesity, through improved nutrition and increased physical activity is one of the goals of the CDC's Winnable Battles initiative. Reducing obesity in rural residents is especially important since they are more likely to be obese than urban residents. Indeed, Iowa residents rank 33rd of 50 states in the percent of residents who are obese and half of Iowa's adults do not meet PA recommendations. Effective interventions to increase PA in rural micropolitan (<50,000 residents) communities are scant since most evidence-based interventions have been tested in urban or suburban areas. In the Midwest, these micropolitan communities are also new destination locations for an influx of Latino populations. The Prevention Research Center for Rural Health (PRC-RH), with a focus on obesity, addresses the health challenges of residents of micropolitan and other rural communities in Iowa through a variety of Center activities and resources as well as the implementation of an intervention research project, ActiveOttumwa. PRC-RH Center activities include maintenance of an infrastructure with cores focusing on community engagement, communication and dissemination of PRC-RH research and best practices, training of public health professionals, students and community members, and evaluation of PRC-RH activities. The PRC-RH has vibrant partnerships with the Iowa Department of Public Health, an active Community Advisory Board, with local health department and community organization representation, in Ottumwa, Iowa, a micropolitan new destination community. The PRC-RH intervention research project, Active Ottumwa focuses on increasing physical activity in Ottumwa by determining the effectiveness of a community-based PA intervention that uses a lay health advisor (LHA) approach - to implement evidence-based PA strategies. Based on the available evidence and strategies from the Community Guide, the Active Ottumwa will implement activities at three levels of influence: 1) community-wide campaigns (e.g. newspaper, TV, and radio announcements, website exposure and public health education programs; 2) behavioral and social support interventions (e.g. behavioral contracts, buddy systems, goal-setting to promote and support PA activities; and 3) land-use policies and access to places for PA, (.e.g. working with local governmental officials and agencies and community leaders to advocate, improve and create opportunities for access and use of facilities for PA). To evaluate Active Ottumwa, mixed methods will be used including a community-wide survey; longitudinal follow up of a cohort of residents that will complete accelerometry, physical and anthropometric measures and survey data; observational measures; key informant in-depth interviews; and project documentation. The research project and PRC-RH will address a major evidence gap in our PA knowledge by adapting intervention strategies tested in urban and suburban areas to a micropolitan new destination community in a rural state."
"9321595","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Rhode Island Department of Health (HEALTH) has been an integral part of the Environmental Health Specialists Network (EHS-Net) for ten years and impacted retail food safety at a national level. In support of the Healthy People 2020 Food Safety goals, HEALTH aims to reduce foodborne illnesses, disabilities, and death through interventions that target reducing food contamination from ill food workers, reducing hand contamination, improving controls through certified kitchen managers always being present during food preparation at food establishments, and improving regulatory effectiveness. Each intervention builds on prior EHS-Net findings that have identified factors associated with food safety issues, but shifts the research paradigm by utilizing a systems approach aimed at achieving maximum impact by targeting the culture of food safety at food service establishments. Reducing illnesses and outbreaks due to ill food workers will be the focus of the first two years of the grant. RI EHS-Net will deliver an intervention packet to all RI food establishments, reinforce with inspections, and compare critical violations before and after the intervention delivery. Behavioral factors will be evaluated at a subset of establishments and compared pre and post intervention using a survey designed to measure indicators of a positive food safety culture. Other proposed interventions will follow similar designs and be conducted in the years that follow. Results from the Certified Kitchen Manager intervention could be used to justify changing the Food Code to require a certified manager during all food preparation, or to mimic the Rhode Island law which allows requiring a CKM at all times if there are serious repeat operational violations. HEALTH has established an effective collaborative structure to achieve the outlined objectives. The Office of Food Protection, Division of Infectious Disease Epidemiology, and the State Health Laboratory are centrally located and will ensure effective, coordinated responses. The University of Rhode Island also supports this statewide initiative. HEALTH will collaborate with EHS-Net in the data analysis of all EHS-Net research projects. Results will be disseminated to the public health community through scientific journals, presentations, possible changes to the Food Code, and other means to encourage national changes in food safety practices."
"9358714","Hospital care accounts for more than 40% of all pediatric healthcare expenditures in the United States, representing approximately 2 million pediatric hospitalizations annually. Lacking rigorously developed and tested measures for this setting, the quality of hospital care for children is not well understood. Hosptial-to- home care transitions and hospital-based mental healthcare are key topics representing gap areas for quality assessment and improvement in pediatrics. The overall goal of this study is to disseminate and test two new quality measure sets: the Transitions of Care Measure Set and the Mental Healthcare in Hospital Settings Measure Set in order to enhance the number of quality measures available to assess and improve pediatric hospital-based care. We will implement these measure sets in eight hospitals serving children and in four state Medicaid agencies in order to understand their validity in predicting better outcomes, their reliability in distinguishing between poor and excellent care, their feasibility of implementation in a variety of healthcare settings, and their usability for quality improvement (QI) and accountability purposes.  The specific aims of the study are: 1) To disseminate and implement the Transitions of Care and Mental healthcare in Hospital Settings measures sets in eight hospitals nationally to examine a) feasibility of tool implementation, b) quality measure validity, and c) quality measures reliability in a variety of healthcare settings, 2) To identify one quality measure from each measure set as a target for QI collaborative intervention by evaluating variation in baseline performance on individual measures within each set across the eight hospitals, 3) To improve overall performance by 50% on the two targeted measures by the end of the QI collaborative and to assess whether better performance is associated with improved outcomes, and 4) To assess the responsiveness of both a) the measures targeted for QI intervention and b) the full measure sets to the QI collaborative interventions.  We will accomplish these aims by bringing together a multidisciplinary, multi-stakeholder team of experts representing state Medicaid agencies from three states, an External Quality Review Organization, eight hospitals serving children insured by Medicaid or the Child Health Insurance Program (CHIP), experts in quality measurement, dissemination and implementation science, conducting hospital-based QI collaboratives, and academic researchers."
"9565038","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Over the past few years, increasing evidence has supported the existence of extracellular tau and the concept of transcellular propagation of tau species as a mechanism for the initiation and progression of Alzheimer's disease. In this context, using antibodies to target tau pathology appeared an appropriate approach to clear neurofibrillary tangles in Alzheimer's disease (AD) models. A conspicuous amount of data has been produced by different laboratories showing efficient reduction of tau pathology in transgenic animal models using tau monoclonal antibodies, with a different degree of success according to the epitopes targeted. Nevertheless, the mechanism by which tau antibodies function as treatments for tau pathology is still unclear. To address this point, we will employ engineered antibodies composed of the variable regions of the heavy and light chains joined by a short linker (scFv), preserving the epitope specificity and affinity of the parent antibodies. The work proposed in this application is designed to use tau scFvs carried by viral vectors (AAV) in order to specifically target neurons or astrocytes in vitro and in vivo. We will clone into viral vectors the scFvs corresponding to different tau antibodies previously tested in passive immunization experiments. These engineered tools will be used first in vitro in order to address the question whether the most efficient strategy to reduce tau phosphorylation/aggregation will be to target tau acting from the extracellular milieu or from the intraneuronal compartment. Furthermore, we will be testing if by providing a chronic release of recombinant antibodies directly in the mice brain parenchyma, either by intraneuronal production or by extracellular exposure, we can define the mechanism by which these antibodies exert their therapeutic effects as well as developing an efficient strategy to reduce tau aggregates in transgenic animal models and potentially in humans."
"9572616","The National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) is a principal agency of the U.S. Federal Statistical System which provides statistical information to guide actions and policies to improve the health of the American people. NCHS is housed within the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), which is part of the United States Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS). The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) is an NCHS survey, operating out of mobile examination centers that travel to randomly selected sites throughout the country to assess the health and nutritional status of Americans. The authority for NHANES derives from the 1956 National Health Survey Act, Public Law #652 of the 84th Congress, which authorized the DHHS Secretary to conduct a continuing survey of illness and disability in the Nation. As part of the charter for the program, funding for the surveys was to be obtained from other organizations within and external to the government. The NHLBI?s involvements focuses on the cardiovascular, pulmonary, and sleep health of US citizens, with cost-effective, highly reliable and valid measures.  In June 2015, The NHLBI Council strongly recommended that NHANES replace the mercury devices currently in use for blood pressure measurement with suitable automatic oscillometric devices. The change will take place in NHANES for the 2019-2020 phase. The use of mercury in sphygmomanometers to measure blood pressure puts the environment at risk locally and globally due to the risk of mercury contamination associated with potential breakage. The NHLBI and NIH have been moving forward on a campaign to eliminate mercury sphygmomanometers from research clinics and to replace them with suitable replacements.  Of paramount importance is the comparability of blood pressure data to monitor trends for the U.S. population, with the ultimate goal of assessing trends in hypertension prevalence and control. Mercury measurements have been the basis of estimates of trends in blood pressure going back more than 50 years. For mercury sphygmomanometers, rigorous training and testing for the certified operators, be they physician or technician, have been required. No device has been identified that can replicate the measurements from a mercury sphygmomanometer exactly. However, a suitable alternative device has been examined and has been found to provide measurements within 2% of those provided by mercury. Concerns about changes in proprietary algorithms and similar concerns will need to be addressed in the measurement protocol. In order to better address the issue of comparability of blood pressure measurements taken from oscillometric devices as compared to mercury devices, a calibration study will be performed to generate a calibration equation. The resulting calibration equation will be applied to oscillometric measurements to estimate trends. It is anticipated that the oscillometric measurements to be obtained will be comparable to measurement obtained earlier (1999-2018) using the heretofore standard mercury sphygmomanometer protocol.  Documentation of the trends in key indicators of cardiovascular, lung, and sleep disorders are required to track the impact of national prevention and control programs. National data also are used to identify segments of the population not benefiting from risk reduction. NHANES is the only nationally-representative survey with both a questionnaire and clinical exam. Measurements for components are standardized and comparable across time to allow for trend analyses."
"9515362","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The objective of this research is to create a clinical prototype of a new optical coherence tomography (OCT) system for use in point of care settings. The target system price will be one third the price of currently available research OCT system while providing system performance comparable to other entry level OCT imaging systems. By breaking the $10,000 system barrier we will provide an incisive tool that will be disruptive to the market by making OCT accessible to most clinics. We have spoken with ophthalmologists who confirm the need for this system in the detection and monitoring of diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma, retinopathy of prematurity, and macular degeneration. Ophthalmology is the first clinical target but we have talked to users from other specialties including, ENT, oncology, dermatology, neurology, and gastroenterology. By significantly reducing instrument cost, this OCT system will be affordable for use at the point of care and in a wide range of research applications. This price point also opens markets in developing countries where the value of clinical OCT is understood, but currently clinical systems are too expensive. The research plan, proposed here, will create a prototype of the low cost instrument that utilizes an innovative system architecture based on newly available components while delivering all the imaging capabilities of OCT. We propose to achieve the following milestones: (1) Implement sub-systems as portable components, (2) Integrate sub-systems and software, and (3) Validate and test the complete portable system using an OCT eye phantom."
"9418970","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The Administrative Core (AC) exists to promote the vision of the Ponce Health Sciences University- Moffitt Cancer Center (PHSU-MCC) Partnership, which is to reduce health disparities in a variety of different ways, ultimately resulting in improved cancer treatments and precision medicine approaches best suited for the Puerto Rico and Florida Hispanic populations.  The AC plays a significant role, serving as the functional infrastructure of the Partnership, promoting innovative cancer research, outreach and biobanking toward an underserved population, and research education of under-represented individuals. Specifically, it provides oversight, organization, and ongoing evaluation for the scientific and administrative aspects of the Partnership. Such oversight includes but is not limited to day-to-day administrative and financial oversight, coordination of activities, and logistical support. Administrative and coordinating activities occur at both institutions, with continuous communications being one of the principal responsibilities of the AC. In the renewal, the AC will retain a composition/configuration similar to that in the current Partnership. This structure is highly effective in providing scientific and administrative oversight while promoting collaboration among the multiple components. For the competitive renewal, the Specific Aims of the AC are to: 1) Provide the functional infrastructure of the Partnership in terms of innovation, direction, leadership, and fiscal/administrative support for the individual scientific projects and cores, 2) Facilitate communications at all levels, 3) Set expectations, provide support, and monitor the productivity of the Partnership?s projects and cores."
"9334562","The purpose of this Phase II research project is to evaluate and market an innovative health message intervention to increase uptake of the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine and reduce women?s cervical cancer risk through partnership with Planned Parenthood. The overall aim is to reach a broad population through Planned Parenthood, the nation?s leading sexual and reproductive health care center, especially among low socioeconomic status (SES) and historically underserved populations. Despite an overall increase in vaccination and reduction in HPV-related infections in younger populations targeted by previous health promotion efforts, young adult women who are recommended for vaccination demonstrate much lower vaccination rates and higher rates of infection. In a recent Phase I grant, we developed and demonstrated the usability and feasibility of an innovative, culturally-grounded, technology-based narrative intervention that delivers decision narratives in the form of videos via a health kiosk, an underutilized communication strategy for reaching less involved audiences. This brief, low-cost, easily implementable intervention doubled the uptake of the vaccine in a separate pilot study. The proposed Phase II project will: (1) Complete development of the intervention, (2) Evaluate its effectiveness through a randomized clinical trial, and (3) Prepare the product for the market. To accomplish these aims, we will develop the intervention for implementation in waiting rooms as part of check-in procedures and exam rooms as part of intake. Our pilot research suggests these are both viable implementation strategies. Development includes programing and installing tablets to accomplish these tasks (Aim 1). We will then conduct the evaluation study in six Planned Parenthood clinics in southeastern Pennsylvania (Aim 2). In the waiting room condition, women will complete check-in via a tablet and that information used to identify and recruit eligible volunteers (unvaccinated women aged 18-26). In the exam room condition the intervention will be viewed on a tablet as part of the intake procedure, facilitated by a nurse or other designated clinic staff. Eligible women will be consented, complete a pretest, and then randomized to view the brief intervention or attention control messages via the tablet. After viewing the messages, they will complete a short posttest. Participants will receive follow up texts/emails reminding them to vaccinate, as well as texts/emails with links that allow them to complete posttest surveys at 3- and 9 months. Finally, we will prepare the intervention for the market that includes not only Planned Parenthood but other clinics that are currently served by the project partners as well as the broader market for HPV vaccination (Aim 3). In summary, the proposed communication strategy has wide reaching implications not only for reducing cancer risk, but more broadly for designing brief and easily implemented prevention messages across many domains of public health. The research will also close the health disparities gap in minority, underserved young adult women?s access to preventive health care."
"9346612","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Machado-Joseph Disease (MJD) is a dominantly inherited neurodegenerative disease characterized by a loss of muscle coordination, for which currently only symptomatic treatments exist. MJD is a CAG/polyglutamine disorder, in which patients possess expanded CAG nucleotide repeats in the ATXN3 gene. This results in an abnormally long polyglutamine tract, as well as misfolding and aggregation of the ataxin-3 protein. Since reducing levels of disease proteins improves pathology in animal models of polyglutamine diseases, reducing levels of pathogenic ataxin-3 could be a viable therapy for MJD. We recently demonstrated that ataxin-3 does not require ubiquitination to be degraded. Rather, its turnover is regulated by ubiquitin-binding site 2 (UbS2) on its N terminus. Ataxin-3 is stabilized by its interaction with the proteasome-associated proteins Rad23A/B through UbS2. Mutating UbS2 to disrupt the interaction between ataxin-3 and Rad23A/B decreases ataxin-3 protein levels in cultured mammalian cells. These findings led us to conclude that UbS2 could be a potential target through which to enhance ataxin-3 degradation for MJD therapy. To test this hypothesis, first, we propose to determine the molecular mechanism by which ataxin-3 is degraded in vitro. To accomplish this, we will carry out a panel of in vitro reactions with differet combinations of wild type or mutated ataxin-3, proteasomes, and Rad23A/B. We will confirm our findings from in vitro recombinant assays by examining molecular complexes in mammalian cells through co-immunoprecipitations and size-exclusion chromatography. Secondly, we will test our hypothesis for ataxin-3 degradation in vivo by generating transgenic Drosophila lines that express either ataxin-3 with all of its domains intact, or ataxin-3 with UbS2 mutated. We will determine the role of Rad23 and UbS2 in ataxin-3-dependent toxicity through tissue-specific expression of our constructs. We will examine lethality, longevity, morphology, histology, and motility in these flies. Finally, we will conduct a discovery-based screen for novel suppressors of ataxin-3 dependent degeneration in vivo, utilizing a method that we developed in our laboratory, which reports retinal integrity in intact flies by using membrane-bound GFP. The goals of this proposed research coincide with the mission of the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, as the results from this research can be translated into efficacious therapies for patients suffering from MJD."
"9429217","Abstract Hippocampal long term potentiation (LTP) is the enhancement of synaptic transmission that may underlie long term memory storage. This form of synaptic plasticity has been highly studied in the hippocampal CA3 to CA1 synapse. Hebb predicted in the 1940s before any molecular understanding of LTP was known, that LTP must be dependent upon ?some growth process or METABOLIC change? taking place in one or both cells so that ?A's EFFICIENCY as one of the cells firing B is increased.? After high frequency stimulation in the hippocampus, acute and persisting growth processes do occur including regulation of Ca2+ flux through NMDA receptors into the CA1 neuron, and enhanced insertion of AMPA receptors into the postsynaptic membrane but a METABOLIC change required to alter the EFFICIENCY of synaptic transmission to induce and/or sustain LTP has never been found. In this application we will test if a long term change in mitochondrial efficiency dependent upon Bcl-xL is required for the onset of LTP. We have found previously that mitochondria manifest improved metabolic efficiency upon expression of the Bcl- 2 family protein Bcl-xL. Bcl-xL is highly expressed in cancer cells resistant to cell death, but also contributes to changes in synaptic strength. Bcl-xL targets to mitochondria, localizes these organelles to synapses and increases the number and size of synapses and the rate of spontaneous neurotransmitter release events. Most importantly for this study, we have found that Bcl-xL increases the production of ATP by mitochondria through its ability to decrease the probability of opening of a leak channel found within the ATP synthase c-subunit. Upon high frequency synaptic stimulation, Bcl-xL moves to mitochondria and a halo of ATP forms around the mitochondria, and this persistently enhanced mitochondrial ATP level appears to be dependent on Bcl-xL and required for LTP. In this proposed study, we will determine if LTP requires a true change in efficiency of mitochondrial function. We will consider that there is an increase in efficiency if we find a relative decrease or no change in oxygen consumption by mitochondria during enhanced ATP production. We will confirm if targeting of Bcl-xL to the ATP synthase is required for the change in efficiency of ATP production. We will determine if the association of Bcl-xL with mitochondria is linked to the onset of LTP in hippocampal CA1 neurons. Finally, we will determine if a low conductance ATP synthase c-subunit will reverse the effects of genetic Bcl- xL depletion, and will allow for the onset and/or maintenance of LTP."
"9446066","Abstract There is growing interest in targeting DNA damage repair (DDR), however predictive markers are largely lacking and optimal combinations with targeted therapies have not been elucidated. In preliminary studies, we have shown that poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors have antitumor efficacy not only in PDX models with germline BRCA mutations, but also in PDX models with other germline or somatic alterations in DDR genes. Further, we have shown that K-Ras mutant cell lines are resistant to PARP inhibitors and that MEK inhibitors enhance the antitumor efficacy of PARP inhibitors. In other work, we have found that there is a significant enrichment of PI3K pathway alterations in patients with mutations in DDR genes (p=0.008). We propose that clinically and molecularly annotated PDX models can help identify predictive markers of response to DDR inhibitors and can be used to develop rational combination therapies. Our long term goal is to use molecular features of each patient?s tumor to optimize therapy selection. As a PDX development and trial center, we expect to build a large panel of PDXs to facilitate genotype (and other molecular subtype)- phenotype correlation. We hypothesize that tumors with DDR defects will be more likely to benefit from DNA damage inhibitors (such as PARP, ATR, Wee1), and that targeting actionable genomic co-alterations and adaptive responses may enhance anti-tumor efficacy."
"9428230","ABSTRACT. Soluble oligomers of beta amyloid (A?) protein are the most potent neuroactive structural form of this protein and evidence suggests they cause the synaptotoxic changes resulting in cognitive decline in Alzheimer?s disease (AD) (Selkoe and Hardy 2016, Viola and Klein 2015). A safe and effective drug against A? oligomers should prevent and reverse this synaptotoxicity. CT1812 is the first drug that selectively displaces oligomers from synaptic receptor sites and clears oligomers from the brain into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). This first-in-class drug works by displacing A? oligomers bound to neuronal receptors at synapses. It accomplish this by allosterically modulating a key protein regulator of oligomer receptors (the sigma- 2/PGRMC1 protein complex), thus destabilizing the oligomer binding site and increasing the off-rate of oligomers, which are then rapidly cleared into the CSF (within hours). As a result, CT1812 restores synapse number and cognitive performance to normal in preclinical AD mouse models (Izzo et al., 2014a, b). This project proposes to evaluate whether CT1812 can rapidly clear A? oligomers into the CSF in Alzheimer?s patients by conducting a Phase 1b randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial in 16 A?-positive mild to moderate Alzheimer?s patients (MMSE 18-26). Following indwelling catheter placement in the lumbar spinal cord by an experienced anesthesiologist and collection of hourly baseline CSF samples for 4 hours, a single oral dose of CT1812 or placebo is given, followed by hourly sampling of the CSF for 24 hours. Samples are subsequently analyzed for A? oligomer concentrations by oligomer-selective immunoassay. Our primary aim is to evaluate oligomer concentrations in the CSF in CT1812-treated vs. placebo-treated AD patients over 24 hours and correlate these levels with concentrations of CT1812 in the plasma and CSF. Our secondary aim is to evaluate changes in CSF protein markers associated with Alzheimer?s disease and synaptic damage (including neurogranin and SNAP25). By measuring oligomers displaced by CT1812 and cleared into CSF, this trial can directly test the mechanism of action of CT1812 and identify CSF oligomers as a biomarker of CT1812 target engagement in AD patients. We hypothesize that increases in CSF oligomer concentration following CT1812 treatment, but not placebo treatment, will be demonstrated in this trial, and that these changes will correlate with the overall plasma and CSF concentrations of CT1812. Completion of this pilot study in AD patients will inform the design and methods of the subsequent Phase 2a proof of concept trials with CT1812. Advancement of CT1812 clinical development would substantially improve the lives of the 36 million people worldwide suffering from AD and MCI due to AD, for whom no disease-modifying pharmacological treatments exist."
"9341423","Project Summary/Abstract: Understanding the complex circuitry within mammalian brains remains a major challenge, which, if met, will provide critical insight into brain function and could provide guidance for developing treatments of neurological disorders and diseases. In this regard, the ability to map and modulate the same neural network with cellular resolution over months to years would be vital for elucidating, for example, how existing neurons evolve into neural circuits with diverse dynamics through learning, or to understand aging-associated brain changes and cognitive decline caused by neurodegenerative diseases. This project will explore a new paradigm for seamlessly integrating electronics within the brain, termed syringe- injectable mesh electronics, to provide these key mapping and modulation capabilities. This approach centers on the development of networks of recording and stimulating electrodes with size, connectivity and mechanical properties similar to neurons and neural tissue, which are delivered by controlled syringe injection to form stable non-invasive implants within the central nervous system. Systematic longitudinal studies will be carried out to track neural activity with single-neuron resolution across multiple brain regions associated with impairment or dysfunction of motor control, memory and cognitive capability related to aging and Alzheimer's disease. Mesh electronic probes will be injected into the distinct brain regions of rodents that define relevant circuitry, and imaging studies carried out to characterize the neural network/mesh electronics structures. Long-term recording and analysis of neural activity will be used to illuminate circuit behavior associated with aging as well as Alzheimer's disease. Stimulator electrodes will also be integrated within the mesh electronics probes and will be used to modulate activity, which will provide further understanding of the complex system-level circuitry and point to potential therapeutic applications. In addition, the syringe-injectable mesh electronics will be developed for studies of other areas of the nervous system, including the retina and spinal cord, where it is difficult to implement more conventional rigid probes. Non-axial intravitreal injection will be used to deliver mesh electronics to the cup-like retina of mice in a minimally invasive manner. Chronic in-vivo studies of the mouse retina will be carried out to optimize mesh design for epiretinal unfolding, to define positions of the mesh electrodes with respect to fluorescently labeled retinal cells, and to record from different retinal cells when awake restrained mice are subjected to different visual stimuli. Last, syringe-injectable mesh electronics will be used in a new approach to integrate electrical probes for development of neural prosthetics for treatment of spinal cord injury. The mesh electronics will be injected between vertebrae in rodents and used to investigate interfacing of sensing and stimulation electrodes with the spinal cord in the presence and absence of spinal cord injury, with the ultimate goal of developing new therapeutic approaches for spinal cord injury."

"9552943","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) can result in the disturbance of cognitive, behavioral, emotional, and physical functioning. Residual cognitive disturbance remains the most significant concern of persons with all severities of TBI. Normal brain cognitive function depends on synaptic connectivity via neurotransmitter release. We have previously shown that experimental TBI can produce persistent deficits in evoked neurotransmitter release, but the mechanisms are unknown. Neurotransmitter release at the synapse requires fusion of synaptic vesicles with the presynaptic plasma membrane. We have data that a crucial step in this process involving the assembly of a soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor (SNARE) complex is impaired after TBI. This concept is supported by novel ultra-structural preliminary data that demonstrate a reduction of vesicles near the synaptic active zone after TBI. We have also found that proteins important to the assembly of SNARE complexes are decreased after TBI. Cysteine string protein alpha (CSP?), which promotes SNARE-complex assembly by chaperoning SNAP-25 during synaptic activity, is reduced after TBI. Alpha (?)-synuclein is a protein localized mainly in synapses wher it is thought to function in the regulation of synaptic transmission via interaction with specific pools of synaptic vesicles, thereby modulating synaptic functions in the normal brain. There is evidence that a normal role of ?-synuclein is to assist in SNARE complex formation through its interaction with VAMP2. We have preliminary data that native ?-synuclein is decreased from 6hrs to 4 weeks after experimental TBI, suggesting impaired normal function of ?-synuclein. Relevant to this project are recent reports demonstrating that 1) a genetic knock-out of ?-synuclein can reduce the number of vesicles at the presynaptic terminal () and 2) that ?-synuclein can rescue neurons that genetically lack CSPa (). Since both distal synaptic vesicles and CSP? are diminished after TBI, we hypothesize that therapies that restore normal wild-type ?-synuclein levels after TBI will prevent SNARE complex assembly deficits and improve neurotransmitter release and cognitive function after TBI. The first Aim will examine the effects of TBI on wild-type and cytotoxic forms of ?-synuclein. The second Aim will determine the effects of over-expression of ?-synuclein on markers of SNARE protein complex assembly, neurotransmitter release, and cognition. The last Aim will determine if restoring (post-TBI) wild-type ?-synuclein levels can attenuate SNARE protein complexes, increase distal pools of synaptic vesicles, prevent neurotransmitter release deficits, and improve behavioral function. This Aim is supported by preliminary data demonstrating that docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), which has been shown to increase ?-synuclein, can attenuate the post-injury loss of wild-type ?-synuclein. While the neurodegenerative properties of ?-synuclein have been a major research area, the concept of restoring ?-synuclein homeostasis represents a novel target of therapeutic intervention after TBI."
"9264937","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Written language is a crowning achievement of the human brain: it allows the thoughts of one person to flow into the mind of another despite great time and distance between them. For most readers, this information transfer happens effortlessly. Nevertheless, there are limits to how much text can be understood at once; for instance, you do not yet know what the next sentence says. This project uses a combination of behavioral testing and brain imaging to answer the following questions: Is it possible to recognize two words simultaneously? If not, what internal bottlenecks constrain the processing of printed text? Human observers will make judgments about various aspects of words that are flashed simultaneously on both sides of a computer screen. In addition, the observers will either focus attention on one location or divide attention between words at both locations. While they do that, their brain activity will be recorded with functional magnetic resonance imaging. Of particular interest are the visual areas of the brain, including one that responds selectively to words. Some brain areas may respond less strongly when attention is divided than focused, indicating that those areas play a role in determining behavioral accuracy. Furthermore, by varying the demands of the task, this project will uncover the particular stages of visual word processing-from extracting the features of individual letters to retrieving the semantic meaning-that impose the greatest limits on reading ability. The results will enhance our understanding of the limitations of the human brain, setting the stage for further research applied to learning disabilities. Dyslexia impairs reading for up to 10 percent of the population, and it may have multiple causes including difficulties with word sounds (phonology). In some theories, reading is slowed by failures to select small chunks of text in the correct order, or by improper division of attention across the page. Therefore, by studying how visual attention works in typical readers, this project may elucidate the mechanisms of dyslexia and impairments caused by brain damage. That knowledge can help design interventions targeted to each individual according to the challenges he or she faces."
"9384255","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Despite advances in prevention, screening, and treatment, colorectal cancer (CRC) remains the 3rd most commonly diagnosed cancer and the 2nd leading cause of cancer deaths among men and women combined in the US. Nearly 1.2 million CRC survivors currently living in the US are at risk of adverse CRC outcomes. The large number of CRC survivors coupled with the considerable financial burden of CRC makes it critical to identify biomarkers to predict recurrence among CRC patients that can be used to guide clinical decisions regarding treatment and surveillance. Currently there are no definitive biomarkers to identify colon cancer with a high likelihood to recur. The human gut contains the largest bacterial ecosystem (gut microbiome) in the human body. However, whether the gut microbiome (directly or indirectly via bacterial metabolites) is associated with CRC recurrence is unknown. Lastly, given the prevalence, and often overuse, of antibiotics and proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) in the population, and their effects on the gut microbiome, the association of antibiotic and PPI use with CRC recurrence needs to be investigated. To address these knowledge gaps, the proposed study seeks to generate high-throughput 16S sequencing data to investigate the associations of tumor-specific gut microbial profiles with colon cancer recurrence. This study will be conducted in two phases. In the discovery phase, we will identify bacterial profiles associated with early recurrence in 283 colon cancer stage II/III patients with available snap frozen tumor tissue. In the validation phase, top bacterial candidates from our discovery phase will be evaluated in an independent set of 600 stage II/III colon cancer patients. Finally, taking advantage of a wealth of high-quality data in Danish medical, clinical, and population registries, we will examine whether pre-diagnostic antibiotic therapy and proton pump inhibitor (PPI) use are associated with recurrence among >21,000 CRC patients diagnosed between 2001 and 2012 in Denmark. The findings of our study will contribute to identification of potential tumor-specific biomarkers of colon cancer recurrence, and clarify the possible roles of the gut microbiome in colon cancer progression."
"9470598","ABSTRACT Background: Rates of depression in US parolees and probationers range from 9-40%, and depression is the most commonly co-occurring MH disorder in those with substance use disorders (SUDs). Depression and psychological distress (PD) are barriers to community re-integration, and contribute to risk taking behaviors, substance use relapse, and recidivism. However, rehabilitative reentry efforts typically focus on substance use treatment alone, resulting in unmet mental health (MH) treatment needs. About 40% of all US ex-offenders recidivate within one year, and correctional spending is individual state's second largest expenditure after Medicaid. Isolated studies indicate differences in depression rates among US parolees and probationers by gender, race, and ethnicity, but national estimates are limited. Methods: The proposed study recognizes the influence of social determinants of health and intersectionality of gender, race, and ethnicity on behavioral health (BH) outcomes and treatment disparities. A secondary analysis of cross-sectional data from the 2014 National Survey on Drug Use and Health, guided by a modified version of Meleis' Transitions Theory adapted to the BH needs of US parolees and probationers, will be used to understand the BH needs and barriers to BH treatment utilization by gender, race, and ethnicity, in a group of US parolees and probationers relative to a group of non-parolees and non-probationers. The specific aims of this study are to: Aim 1: Compare the prevalence of depression, PD, and/or SUD in the parolee and probationer group relative to the reference group, and determine whether these BH outcomes are related to gender, race, ethnicity, and their interactions with group. Aim 2: Compare BH treatment utilization in the parolee and probationer group relative to the reference group, and determine whether BH treatment utilization is related to BH (depression, PD, and/or SUD) and individual (gender, race, and ethnicity) characteristics, awareness of BH needs, and their interactions with group. Aim 3: Compare barriers to BH treatment utilization in the parolee and probationer group relative to the reference group, and determine which BH treatment utilization barriers are related to BH (depression, PD, and/or SUD) and individual (gender, race, and ethnicity) characteristics and their interactions with group. Significance: An understanding of the gender, racial, and ethnic disparities in BH among US parolees and probationers is integral to informing a population-based health approach that allows for strategic resource planning, and service design for the dual-integrative treatment of co-occurring MH and SUDs. This will inform targeted and tailored interventions, and improve equity in access and treatment for BH disorders among the numerous health disparity populations disproportionately represented among US parolees and probationers."
"9362080","Project Summary/Abstract  Two primary roles of the stomach are to digest food and destroy ingested pathogens. However, the harsh, acidic stomach environment, while necessary for function, must be balanced with secretion of protective mucous and tissue regeneration to prevent tissue damage and disease. In addition, immune system is an important regulator of stomach health. Immune function must balance between necessary removal of cellular debris and protection from infection but avoid autoimmune reaction and chronic inflammation. Dysregulation of stomach and/or the immune system can result in gastric cancer, which is the third leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide. Glucocorticoids are primary stress hormones that function to suppress inflammation, direct wound healing, and direct cellular differentiation in a variety of tissues and organ systems. Disrupted glucocorticoids signaling is associated with a plethora of diseases including autoimmune disease, chronic inflammatory disease, heart disease, and a wide variety of cancers. Surprisingly, the role of glucocorticoids in the stomach remains unknown. We recently discovered that glucocorticoid signaling is required for stomach health and function in mice. Systemic removal of glucocorticoids by adrenalectomy caused gastric gland atrophy, mucous cell metaplasia, and chronic inflammation. Closer analysis revealed nearly complete loss of parietal and chief cells and hyperplasia of mucous neck cells. The gastric pathology was completely reversed after 2 weeks of glucocorticoid replacement therapy. In the proposed aims, we will determine the impact of long-term glucocorticoid deficiency on stomach health and characterize the physiological mechanism(s) of glucocorticoid action in the stomach. In Aim 1, we will characterize the relative risk of stomach cancer following systemic removal of glucocorticoids. We predict that the observed gastric pathology will cause spontaneous development of gastric cancer. In Aim 2, we will determine the extent that autoimmunity or chronic inflammation contribute to the gastric pathology after adrenalectomy. In Aim 3, we will characterize how glucocorticoid signaling in parietal, chief, and mucous neck cells regulates their function, self-renewal, and maintains stomach health. At the conclusion of this study, we will have established the role of glucocorticoid signaling on stomach health and cancer prevention. These discoveries will open new avenues for future studies to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying glucocorticoid action in the stomach and define how glucocorticoids, by promoting tissue homeostasis, suppress formation of gastric cancer. !"
"9376699","PROJECT SUMMARY  There is an important unmet need in glaucoma to develop next-generation functional imaging modalities. The advent of high resolution retinal imaging technologies, specifically, optical coherence tomography and adaptive optics scanning laser ophthalmoscopy, has enabled evaluation of retinal anatomical features at a cellular level in living human eyes. However, assessment of anatomy only provides limited information about the health and function of the retinal tissue. There remains a pressing need for molecular and metabolic endpoints in evaluating glaucoma, where structural changes may take many years to appear, often associated with significant vision loss. Currently available techniques for assessment of retinal blood flow, oxygen saturation, and mitochondrial function in humans have limited depth discrimination and require separate instruments, hampering accurate and comprehensive quantification of retinal ganglion cell physiology. Thus, we propose to develop and validate an innovative depth-resolved retinal metabolic imaging system, scanning protocols and analysis algorithms to non-invasively, quantitatively and simultaneously assess retinal oxygen and mitochondrial metabolism in glaucoma, and in response to candidate neuroprotective or regenerative therapies, both in animal models and in human subjects. We will perform pilot studies to demonstrate and validate the technology's capability to provide metabolic measures relevant to vision restorative therapies in animals and humans. The availability of novel retinal metabolic measures will for the first time introduce a physiologically-based outcome measure for disease characterization and also for candidate therapies relevant to regenerative ophthalmology and vision restoration. In addition, the proposed research will have a significant impact on advancing: 1) knowledge of retinal metabolic dysfunction in animal models of human glaucoma and other optic neuropathies, 2) translation of candidate regenerative therapies that improve retinal metabolic function in pre-clinical studies, and 3) clinical assessment and evaluation of available and emerging therapies for restoring vision in glaucoma, as well as in other degenerative retina/optic nerve diseases."
"9468227","PROJECT SUMMARY  Intracellular pathogens account for a significant amount of morbidity and mortality world-wide. Here, the model facultative intracellular pathogen Listeria monocytogenes (Lm) will be used to investigate how bacterial pathogens recognize and adapt to the host environment. Previous studies suggested a model in which specific alterations in the redox environment are one of the biological cues detected by intracellular pathogens during infection as a mechanism to sense their localization and regulate genes accordingly. Specifically, we identified the redox-responsive transcriptional regulator SpxA1 as essential for aerobic growth in vitro and critical for Lm virulence. Preliminary data revealed that SpxA1 regulates hundreds of genes in vitro and in vivo. These results have set the stage for investigations into the specific genes that are required in each distinct growth environment.  Experiments proposed in Aim 1a will identify the genes that are required for Lm aerobic growth in vitro, while Aim 1b and 1c will define the SpxA1-dependent genes required for pathogenesis. Experiments described in Aim 2 will develop reporter strains with which to monitor SpxA1 activity and will apply these to define the host signals that activate SpxA1 in vivo. Professional pathogens, such as Lm, have evolved to resist or evade host-derived antimicrobial factors that target invading pathogens. We will use SpxA1-mediated transcriptional adaptation as a sensitive readout with which to investigate these host defenses. Results from these studies will identify the host cell stressors that are encountered during infection and the corresponding Lm transcriptional response that is required for pathogenesis. A thorough understanding of the signaling cascades that are activated during infection and the host cues that stimulate these pathways may reveal fundamental features of the host cytosol that intracellular bacterial pathogens have evolved to detect."
"9347595","PROJECT SUMMARY Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory skin disease affecting approximately 7.5 million Americans that can become debilitating and severely impact quality of life. While an estimated 20% of patients suffer moderate to severe disease forms that require systemic therapy with immune suppressants and ultraviolet phototherapy, the majority (80%) of patients exhibit milder symptoms. For these patients, topical agents such as steroids, vitamin D analogues, and calcineurin inhibitors are prescribed but remain associated with poor efficacy and tolerability. Despite advances in the development of targeted biologics, including cytokine inhibitors, many psoriasis patients remain inadequately treated due to the risk of serious adverse side effects, loss of efficacy and high cost. There is a pressing need for the clinical development of effective, safe, easy to use, affordable topical psoriasis therapeutics that target the upstream proteomic mediators of the disease. Human psoriatic lesions have a profound upregulation of HSP90 versus normal skin, where data support a role in the interplay between the innate and the adaptive immune system. Regranion has recently acquired a potent novel small molecule HSP90 inhibitor with a good safety profile and proven preclinical and anecdotal clinical efficacy data for the treatment of psoriasis. In a xenograft transplantation model of psoriasis, oral delivery of CTXT-102 (previously called Debio 0932) resulted in significant clinical alleviation of psoriasis, reduced epidermal thickness, and dramatic reduction in levels of TNF? and IL-17, pro-inflammatory cytokines linked to the persistence of psoriasis. Similarly, topical delivery of CTXT-102 significantly decreased psoriatic symptoms in psoriasis mouse models. Clinical safety of CTXT-102 has been validated in a CTXT-102 Phase 1 oncology trial; where after 43 days of daily treatment with 800mg CTXT-102, a patient with severe psoriasis covering more than 40% of the skin surface showed complete remission. Based on this supporting preclinical data and serendipitous clinical finding, we plan to develop CTXT-102 in a topical formulation targeting patients with mild to moderate forms of plaque psoriasis. Our strategy is to address the wider and pressing unmet need for patients with mild to moderate from of psoriasis with topical delivery of CTXT-102; to be followed by an oral form in the future for severe psoriasis. The major objectives of this SBIR Phase II proposal are threefold. 1.) A rigorous evaluation of the efficacy and mechanism of action of topical CTXT-102 will be performed in a clinically validated psoriasis model that incorporates a comparative efficacy study versus topical corticosteroid treatment; 2.) completion of necessary IND-enabling GLP dermal sensitivity, dermatopharmacokinetic, and toxicokinetic studies, and 3.) preparation and submission of an IND-package for a future Phase 1b/2 human clinical study. Furthermore, the proposal will enable the formulation of a clinical and regulatory strategy for accelerated development. The completion of the Phase II SBIR aims will provide full characterization of CTXT- 102 in a topical formulation in order to advance into clinical trials following IND approval."
"9454199","Project Summary:  Parkinson?s disease (PD) is characterized by a progressive loss of midbrain dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc), resulting in movement defects. A variety of dominant and recessive genetic mutations have recently been identified in families with a high prevalence of PD (fPD), accounting for ~15% of all PD cases. A defining pathological feature of both fPD and sporadic PD is the presence of intracellular protein aggregates termed Lewy bodies (LB), whose major component is the protein alpha-synuclein (?-syn). Interestingly, ?-syn has recently been hypothesized to exhibit certain ?prion-like? properties, such as the ability to spread through the brain and trigger ?-syn aggregation in interconnected brain regions. Moreover, local injection of ?-syn fibrils into the brains of wild type (WT) mice leads to aggregation of ?-syn within neurons of connected regions distant from the injection site. Together, these findings indicate that ?-syn can be taken up by neurons and transmitted to other neurons in interconnected brain areas, where it can trigger aggregation.  Although considerable progress has been made in support of the progressive nature of ?-syn pathology, the mechanism controlling of ?-syn aggregation remains poorly understood. Recent studies have suggested that autophagic and endosomal pathways are involved. However, these general protein degradation pathways are ubiquitously expressed in all cells, targeting these pathways may cause severe side effects. Therefore, it is critical to identify dopamine neuron specific pathway that is critical for regulating ?-syn aggregation. One unique role of dopaminergic neurons is to synthesize and metabolize the neurotransmitter, dopamine. The metabolic product of dopamine, 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetaldehyde (DOPAL), is highly reactive and promote cytotoxic polymerization of PD-related ?-syn. We hypothesize that enhancing aldehyde dehydrogenase 1a1 (ALDH1a1) ? the key enzyme involved in oxidation of DOPAL in dopamine neurons- would decrease ?-syn burden in vivo thereby attenuating neuronal and behavioral defects associated with synucleinopathy. We will examine 1) whether ALDH1a1 loss of function would enhance ?-syn aggregation in vivo; 2) whether inhibiting upstream enzyme monoamine oxidase (MAO) would decrease ?-syn aggregation and ?-syn fibril propagation; 3) whether overexpression or elevate ALDH1a1 function would be beneficial to protect dopamine neuron against ?-syn aggregation.  Completion of this study will provide important validation of ALDH1a1 as a viable target for Parkinson?s disease therapy. Ultimately, the proposed experiments will be a major step towards the understanding of transmission and aggregation of ?-syn in Parkinson?s disease. !"
"9335827","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Type 2 Diabetes (T2DM) is the seventh leading cause of death in the United States, and is quickly becoming a global pandemic. Its patients suffer either reduced insulin production or insulin sensitivity, the latter of which has been associated with reduced nitric oxide synthase (NOS) activity in T2DM skeletal muscle. NOS proteins produce the gaseous signaling molecule nitric oxide (NO), which has been implicated in glucose uptake and insulin sensitivity. In skeletal muscle, NO is produced by neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS), the tissue's primary NOS isoform. Upon insulin stimulation, NO synthesis increases in normal adult skeletal muscle, whereas no such increase is observed in T2DM adults. Additionally, the endothelial NOS (eNOS) isoform in the vasculature is activated via insulin-activated kinase phosphorylation. That nNOS contains a homologous phosphorylation site is suggestive that nNOS, too, may undergo an activating phosphorylation event with insulin treatment. Yet, it remains unknown if or how nNOS is regulated by insulin in skeletal muscle. Our working hypothesis is that skeletal muscle nNOS is phosphorylated and activated by an insulin-activated kinase(s) during insulin signaling, and that under insulin-resistant conditions, this phosphorylation is attenuated. This will be addressed by the following specific aims: 1) establish that skeletal muscle nNOS is phosphorylated in response to insulin in vitro, and that this phosphorylation affects NO production; 2) identify the kinase(s) activated by insulin that phosphorylates skeletal muscle nNOS under insulin treatment in vitro; and 3) demonstrate that skeletal muscle nNOS is phosphorylated in response to insulin in vivo using mouse models, and that this phosphorylation is attenuated under conditions of insulin resistance. These studies will provide training in molecular biochemistry (immunoblot analysis, mass spectrometry, fluorescent activity assays), cell culture (immunocytochemistry, pharmacological inhibitors, siRNA knockdown, dominant-negative inhibition), and animal models (immunohistochemistry, insulin clamping, diet-induced insulin resistance). These studies are innovative because the role of nNOS in skeletal muscle insulin signaling has yet to be explored, despite it being the primary skeletal muscle NOS isoform. The proposed research is significant because it will more fully reveal fundamental function(s) of NOSs in skeletal muscle insulin signaling. As a result, these studies will have a significant impact on our understanding of skeletal muscle insulin signaling and will lead to development of therapeutic targets to improve skeletal muscle insulin sensitivity, as well as a number of other disorders in which nNOS has been implicated. The applicant's career goal is to become an endocrinologist-investigator who utilizes biochemical approaches to metabolic disease. An integrated educational plan and supportive environment ensures the applicant's career development."
"9393585","Background and significance: To mitigate the risks of adverse outcomes of opioid therapy, the VA Office of Mental Health Operations (OMHO) and the National Pain Management Program developed a tool to estimate and display the risk of adverse outcomes among patients prescribed opioids. Known as the Stratification Tool for Opioid Risk Management (STORM), the data dashboard displays individual patients? level of risk, specific clinical risk factors, use of recommended risk mitigation strategies, and pain treatments. STORM is available for use by the field, but there is uncertainty about how to achieve consistent utilization across VA Medical Centers (VAMCs) and maximize its effectiveness in reducing opioid-related adverse events. The overall objective of this service-directed project is to perform, in collaboration with OMHO and the Partnered Evidence-Based Policy Resource Center (PEPReC), a randomized program evaluation that will allow the VA to randomize VAMCs to different STORM rollout conditions using a stepped-wedge design. This innovative feature will allow the VA to evaluate the impact of different rollout conditions on STORM uptake and clinical impact. Methodology and expected results: All VAMCs will receive a policy memorandum mandating STORM-facilitated case reviews of patients at high risk for opioid-related adverse events. VAMCS will be randomized to a policy that has consequences for not meeting target case review completion rates versus a policy without consequences. Subsequently, facilities will be randomized to perform case reviews on patients at the top 1% versus 5% of STORM risk scores in a stepped-wedge fashion. In this partnered evaluation, PEPReC will use VA administrative and clinical data to examine the effects of the randomized rollout on patient-level clinical outcomes. In parallel, a team of investigators from the Center for Health Research and Promotion (CHERP) will conduct facility-level quantitative and qualitative analyses to identify strategies used to implement STORM-facilitated case reviews across VAMCs nationally, as well as implementation barriers and facilitators at a subset of facilities. The CHERP evaluation consists of two overall aims. Aim 1a is to describe the number and type of strategies VAMCs used to implement the STORM policy and compare implementation strategies across the consequences and no consequences rollout arms. Aim 1b is to examine whether the number and type of STORM implementation strategies used by VAMCs predict achievement of the target case-review completion rate outlined in the STORM policy. These Aims will be achieved by conducting an online survey of implementation strategies used across all VAMCs. Regression techniques will be used to compare the number and types of strategies across rollout arms (Aim 1a) and examine their associations with case review completion rates (Aim 1b). Aim 2 is to identify barriers and facilitators to implementing the STORM policy and compare these barriers and facilitators across facilities in each STORM rollout arm. This will be achieved by interviewing key stakeholders at 40 VAMCs nationally using structured interview questions guided by the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research. This randomized program evaluation provides a unique opportunity to identify the effect of STORM rollout variations and implementation strategies on STORM utilization and outcomes. The evaluation led by CHERP will yield critical insights that will enable OMHO and VA to refine policy implementation, and, synergistic with PEPReC?s evaluation, increase STORM?s clinical impact in accordance with VA priorities for a learning healthcare system."
"9311656","Project Summary This project aims to develop and apply new quantitative differential interference contrast and polarized light microscope techniques, both of whose contrast is independent of specimen orientation. During the previous grant period we built the orientation-independent differential interference contrast (OI-DIC) microscope, which rapidly changes shear directions without any mechanically moved components. The OI-DIC technique, which we have developed, provides the highest quality of optical path length (dry mass) map of thin optical section of unstained and stained specimens with lateral resolution ~250-300nm, axial discrimination depth ~100nm, and optical path length sensitivity ~0.5nm at wavelength 546nm. We believe that images with such high level of resolution cannot be produced by any other currently available interference and phase microscopy techniques. We also built the polychromatic polarized light microscope (polscope), which employs new principle of generating interference color and produces a color image of the birefringent structures with retardances of several nm, which was not possible before. The hue of the structure indicates its slow axis orientation, and the brightness of the structure is proportional to its retardance. We will engineer the improved high-resolution OI- DIC with and exploit two principally new OI-DIC approaches. The new OI-DIC will be combined with the orientation-independent polarization (LC-polscope) and confocal fluorescence techniques. The improved OI- DIC and the combined setup will be used to study the architectural dynamics of live biological specimens, with emphasis on events associated with mitosis and meiosis. We will build an instantaneous OI-DIC, which will simultaneously capture 4 raw DIC images with the orthogonal shear directions. The instantaneous OI-DIC techniques will provide the best temporal resolution and allow the elimination of artifacts caused by movements of the cytosol and organelles. We will develop OI-DIC technique to restore the 3D distribution of both dry mass (phase-related information) and refractive index. With this technique, one will be able to determine the dry mass of chromosomes before division and observe its change during the division process. The new high- sensitive polychromatic polscope will visualize birefringent structures with retardances less than 1nm. The polychromatic polscope will be combined with phase contrast and dark field techniques, so that image brightness displays dry mass distribution and the color depicts molecular orientation. These combined techniques will be used to study metaphase of meiosis I, and analyze the correspondence between structural signatures in different live organisms, as well as their genetic background. We will create a quantitative polychromatic polscope, which will provide a two-dimensional distribution both the specimen?s retardance and slow axis orientation. The quantitative polychromatic polscope will be employed to study collagen fibers in cancer tissues."
"9397765","The over-arching goal of Dr. Wambaugh's research program is to advance understanding and management of acquired apraxia of speech (AOS) and aphasia. Her current research activities are focused on the development and testing of clinically-applicable therapies for AOS and aphasia using sound theoretical bases for treatment and rigorous experimental methods. Her on-going VA RR&D merit project, ?Effects of intensity of treatment on rehabilitation of acquired apraxia of speech? continues her work with Sound Production Treatment (SPT). SPT is a behavioral treatment for AOS which was developed by Dr. Wambaugh; it has been shown to consistently result in improved speech production with persons with AOS representing broad ranges of AOS severity, aphasia severity, chronicity, and age. In order to move SPT toward randomized controlled clinical trials, Dr. Wambaugh has been studying ways to maximize its outcomes. Treatment intensity is a potentially critical factor to consider in the administration of treatment. Dr. Wambaugh and her colleagues are currently evaluating the relative effects of intense administration of SPT (3 hours per day/ 3 days per week / 3 weeks) versus non-intense (?traditional?) SPT (1 hour per day/ 3 days per week/ 9 weeks). Dose frequency and treatment duration are being compared in terms of short and longer term maintenance of production of treated and untreated items (word/phrases). Dr. Wambaugh and her colleague, Dr. Mauszycki, are also comparing the effects of SPT to the effects of electropalatographic (EPG) treatment for AOS. EPG is a method for providing visual biofeedback concerning tongue to palate contact. Some speakers with AOS may have disrupted feedback associated with speech production and may benefit more from visual biofeedback in comparison to clinician-provided feedback. Dr. Wambaugh is also collaborating with researchers from the VA Northern California Health Care System to examine the role of site of lesion in predicting response to SPT and to identify neural plasticity changes associated with treatment. This line of research is the first to address brain biomarkers of treatment response in AOS. Because AOS typically co-occurs with aphasia and it is currently difficult for clinicians to determine how to allocate valuable therapy time among the two disorders, Dr. Wambaugh recently developed a treatment that simultaneously targets speech (AOS) and language (aphasia) symptoms ? Combined Aphasia and Apraxia of Speech Treatment (CAAST). Dr. Wambaugh is continuing to refine the CAAST protocol and is conducting additional in-depth analyses of outcomes associated with this treatment with the aim of bringing this new treatment to randomized controlled clinical trials. In another area of aphasia treatment, Dr. Wambaugh has been extending her work with word-retrieval treatments to identify participant characteristics associated with response to treatment. She and her colleagues have recently begun to study practice effects as a predictor of ability to change (and ultimately benefit from treatment). Her pending RR&D merit submission is designed to address practice effects as a predictor of treatment response as well as a factor influencing generalized responding. Dr. Wambaugh's lab is also engaged in the development of reliable outcome measures for use in evaluating treatment outcomes. As part of Dr. Wambaugh's recent SPiRE award, ?A novel treatment for aphasia and apraxia of speech: Measurement of Outcomes? her lab has collected repeated speech/language samples (over time) from a group of 30 speakers with AOS-aphasia and will be completing stability analyses for numerous outcome measures."
"9309747","Project Summary/Abstract Antibiotic resistance due to the activity of multidrug resistance (MDR) efflux pumps is one important mechanism of bacterial drug resistance. EmrE is one of the smallest known MDR transporters, and it has become a prototype for proton-coupled antiport. EmrE harnesses proton import to drive polyaromatic cation efflux in E. coli, thus conferring resistance to a broad range of drugs. We have previously performed the first quantitative measurement of conformational exchange between open-in and open-out states in a transporter by NMR. Our newest result, asymmetric protonation of EmrE, directly contradicts the long-accepted single-site alternating access model for coupled antiport of drugs and protons. It demonstrates how much is still unknown about this deceptively simply transporter and suggests that the well-known promiscuity of MDR efflux pumps may even be even greater. This project uses NMR spectroscopy and extensive liposomal transport assays to investigate the detailed molecular mechanism of EmrE activity. NMR offers a unique tool because protein conformational exchange and protonation events can be monitored separately and simultaneously, allowing novel insight into how proton and drug transport are coupled. Our goal is to combine quantitative biophysical data and functional assessment of the pH dependence and substrates properties that define EmrE activity to develop a novel model for proton-coupled antiport. We will also test different hypotheses for how proton- coupled antiport is achieved for such diverse substrates with different affinities and transport rates. The insights we gain will aid future efforts to combat bacterial antibiotic resistance due to MDR efflux."
"9552295","Project Summary: The primary goal of this project is to test our core hypothesis that upregulation of activity of kynurenine pathway gatekeeper indoleamine-2, 3-dioxygenase potentiates Huntington?s disease (HD) onset and progression. HD is an ultimately fatal neurodegenerative disease that afflicts about 30000 people in the USA alone and has no effective treatments. CAG-repeat expansion within the huntingtin gene results in expression of a polyglutamine-expanded mutant huntingtin protein (mhtt) leading to downstream effects including transcriptional dysregulation, oxidative stress and activation of the kynurenine pathway of tryptophan degradation. There is growing evidence that disruption of the kynurenine pathway (KP) contributes to the pathogenesis of HD as well as other neurodegenerative and psychiatric disorders. However, little is known about the role of indoleamine-2, 3-dioxygenase (IDO), the enzyme that catalyzes the first and rate-limiting step. We show for the first time large increases in IDO activity in mouse HD brain suggesting that IDO is central to pathway regulation. Others have shown that common latent neuroinvasive pathogens Toxoplasma gondii (T. gondii) and herpes simplex 1 (HSV1) upregulate brain IDO suggesting that they may potentiate HD. We show for the first time that T. gondii-infected HD mice have significant disease potentiation with early brain IDO activation, premature mortality, higher brain parasite burden and dysfunctional T- lymphocyte responses. These important findings point to a link between HD, IDO and IDO-activating CNS infections. Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that decreasing IDO activity is protective in pathogen-free HD mice. In the three sub-aims we will determine the effect of global, brain microglial and peripheral IDO inhibition on a broad range of outcomes in HD mice. Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that latent T. gondii infection potentiates HD and upregulates IDO. Aim 2A will test the effect of latent T. gondii infection in HD mice expressing full- length mhtt. Aim 2B we will determine using human brain if T. gondii infection correlates with earlier onset or faster progression of HD. Aim 3 will test the hypothesis that mhtt-induced immune dysfunction is mediated by IDO / KP and also results in a dysfunctional response to HSV1. Aim 3A will determine if IDO / KP activation mediates T-lymphocyte dysfunction and premature mortality in T. gondii-infected HD mice. Aim 3B will evaluate the effect of latent HSV1 in HD mice and will also determine if HSV1 infection in human HD correlates with earlier disease onset and faster progression. Together, the studies will determine the extent to which IDO contributes to HD, how common neuroinfections that upregulate IDO affect the course of HD, and the mechanisms involved. Findings will be relevant to therapeutic development, understanding the large variability in human HD, improving clinical trial design, and also to other CNS diseases in which the kynurenine pathway is implicated."

"9482284","ABSTRACT: RESEARCH PROJECT #2 Manuscripts submitted to medical journals are typically reviewed by physicians or researchers, with no input from patients or other community members. However, involvement of community members in other phases of the research process suggests that they provide distinct and useful expertise. Such involvement may lead to enhanced understanding of community priorities, refinement of study designs to minimize participant burden, and increased recruitment and retention of subjects. In general, community involvement in research is more common in the earlier phases of the research process (selection of research question and development of a study protocol) and less common in later phases (dissemination and implementation of findings). We conducted a pilot study that recruited and trained community members to review medical journal manuscripts. We found that community reviewers were much more likely than scientific reviewers to comment on i) the relevance of the study to patients and communities, ii) the diversity and complexity of the study participants, iii) the social context of the condition studied, and iv) barriers to implementation of study findings by patients and communities. We now seek to rigorously determine the impact of community members reviewing medical journal manuscripts. We propose a randomized controlled trial involving 16 community members who will receive training and mentoring in reviewing manuscripts. To ensure that the perspectives of health disparity populations are well represented, at least 75% of participants will be racial/ethnic minorities, be sexual/gender minorities, or have a low socioeconomic status. A total of 568 manuscripts submitted to 2 medical journals will be randomly assigned to an intervention or control group. Intervention manuscripts will be reviewed by both a community member and by scientific reviewers while control manuscripts will be reviewed only by scientific reviewers. Journal editorial teams will use all reviews to help them make decisions about acceptance, revision, or rejection of manuscripts. Quantitative and qualitative analyses will i) compare the content of community and scientific reviews, ii) determine the usefulness of community reviews to journal editors, and iii) explore how community reviewer comments are integrated into published articles. The proposed project is a novel approach to engaging health disparity populations and other community members in dissemination of research findings. This approach has the potential to provide new and distinct perspectives, to increase the quality and relevance of articles published in medical journals, and to enhance dissemination and implementation of research findings.  "
"9559959","Neurodegeneration can be triggered by a variety of genetic, epigenetic, and environmental factors. Healthy neurons are able to maintain their integrity throughout the life of an animal, suggesting the existence of a maintenance mechanism that allows neurons to sustain, mitigate or even repair damage. Previous work in our lab and others has found NMNAT proteins in Drosophila and mammals to be robust and versatile neuroprotective factors. However, it remains unclear whether and how neurons regulate the neuroprotective processes mediated by maintenance factors such as NMNAT. How neurons partition NMNAT into two distinct functions ? NAD metabolism and neuroprotection, and how such partitioning is regulated under normal and adverse conditions to achieve neuroprotection are the focus of this proposal. Our preliminary studies have found that Drosophila nmnat is alternatively spliced, producing splice isoforms with divergent neuroprotective activities, and that neurons could alter the preference for splice variants production under stress towards the neurprotective variant and therefore achieve self-protection. We hypothesize that alternative splicing and other post-transcriptional regulations are an essential endogenous program for regulating neuronal self-protective response under normal, stress, and disease conditions. Importantly this mechanism is likely conserved between fly and mammals as we have collected preliminary data indicating that human NMNAT genes are also alternatively spliced. In this proposal, we plan to uncover the key mechanisms to enhance neuroprotection in Drosophila and then extend the study to human NMNATs in mammalian neurons. First, we will characterize the biochemical and cellular properties of Drosophila and human NMNAT protein isoforms, and illustrate the role of alternative splicing in post-transcriptional regulation of nmnat genes. Next, we will identify alternative splicing as a stress response that affords protection to neurons, and further reveal the functional role of microRNAs in regulating the abundance of neuroprotective RNA variants and modulating the neuroprotective efficacy of NMNAT. Finally, we will study human NMNAT protein isoforms and characterize the neuroprotective function of alternatively spliced NMNAT isoforms in cultured DRG explants and in vivo in corticospinal track (CST) neurons, and identify key mechanisms underlying the divergent neuroprotective effects of NMNAT variants in degenerative conditions. Studies on Drosophila and human NMNATs using a ?two-model? approach will reveal the evolutionarily conserved posttranscriptional regulatory mechanisms and identify strategies relevant to enhancing neuroprotection in humans."

"9568855","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this K99/R00 project is to test the hypothesis that genotoxic stress in the nucleus triggers signaling events that result in accumulation of dysfunctional mitochondria, which in turn drives cellular senescence and aging. The hypothesis is supported by preliminary data demonstrating that depletion of the DNA repair endonuclease ERCC1-XPF in cells and mice causes accumulation of oxidative DNA damage, premature cellular senescence and aging, but also surprisingly mitochondrial dysfunction and increased reactive oxygen species. Moreover, ERCC1-deficient C. elegans also show evidence of mitochondrial dysfunction. ERCC1- XPF is required only for the repair of the nuclear genome, suggesting that nuclear stress can drive mitochondrial abnormalities. Similar observations have been made in murine models and human cells of ataxia telangiectasia and Hutchinson-Gilford Progeria syndrome. Herein we propose to define the molecular mechanism(s) by which nuclear genomic instability triggers mitochondrial dysfunction using an innovative combination of powerful genetic tools. The significance of these studies is the possibility of identifying novel signaling mechanisms that could be targeted therapeutically to prevent cell senescence, aging and age-related diseases arising as a consequence of stochastic damage to cells. The approach will be a genome-wide RNAi screen in ercc-1 C. elegans to identify genes that suppress Complex 1 dysfunction in mutant worms. This unbiased approach will yield pathways that impact mitochondrial function in response to endogenous genotoxic stress and undoubtedly new hypotheses about mechanisms of aging. This will fuel my transition to becoming an independent investigator, a second important goal of this project. A targeted preliminary screen established the feasibility of the approach and revealed several genes critical for the DNA damage response and mitophagy, including ATM, p53, DRP1 and PINK1, that regulate mitochondrial function in ercc-1 worms. These novel links between the nucleus and mitochondria identified in nematodes will be pursued in mice and murine cells. The innovative approach of exploiting the strengths of two very powerful model systems will allow identification of novel molecular targets and support rapid translation of this new knowledge to human aging. The majority of individuals over the age of 65 years suffer from at least two chronic degenerative diseases. These chronic diseases of the elderly consume an increasingly large fraction of our health care costs and rob individuals of their independence and quality of life. Developing therapies to target the primary risk factor for all of these diseases, aging itself, is  promising yet challenging solution. The first step is to define the molecular mechanisms that drive aging. This project aims to identify the signaling mechanisms that drive aging in response to endogenous DNA damage, which accumulates in all of us over time. This will reveal novel therapeutic targets that can be exploited to extend healthspan."
"9418978","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The Research Education Core (REC) of the Partnership between Ponce Health Sciences University (PHSU, formerly known as PSM) and the Moffitt Cancer Center (MCC) has built an educational pipeline designed to address several identified barriers which are known to contribute towards cancer health disparities within the Hispanic/Latino (H/L) population and, particularly within Puerto Rico (PR). These include a scarcity of H/L cancer researchers, cancer diagnoses at a more advanced-stage, reduced access to cancer care, underrepresentation in clinical cancer trials, and limited awareness of cancer research and cancer control within the local population. The overall objective of the REC of the PSM-MCC Partnership is to increase the number and quality of basic science investigators and clinical research scientists focused on precision and preventative cancer medicine research for the PR population. Our core tangibly improved and achieved the benchmarks established in our previous cycle of funding. Under the next cycle we propose to refine our ongoing activities taking into consideration those endeavors that worked well while modifying those that were less successful. We will provide rigorous and structured student education at both institutions, with a comprehensive network of faculty research hosts/advisors and peers for career guidance and development. To achieve our goals participants will be recruited at multiple career levels: PHSU graduate and medical students; MCC graduate and medical students; and PR residents and fellows. The specific measurable objectives of the REC are as follows: (1) Provide education in research methods with specific experiences to enhance cancer research focused on the Puerto Rican and H/L populations; (2) Enhance research education in health disparities at MCC and provide additional opportunities for PR post-doctoral fellows, and (3) Support the careers of medical fellows and residents to enhance the cancer clinical research capacity in PR and treatment of the PR population. Successful outcomes from these goals will expand the numbers and achievements of Puerto Rican cancer investigators, address Hispanic health disparities on the Island, contribute to a long-term cancer research education infrastructure at PHSU, and augment cancer research aimed at improving the diagnosis and treatment of cancer in the Hispanic population in both PR and Florida. The REC will complement and leverage the existing programs at both MCC and PHSU to significantly enhance the overall Partnership objectives by providing a better trained workforce to conduct cancer related research with the momentum to create new research initiatives addressing the health disparities found in Hispanic populations."

CHIRAL will focus on some of the most perilous moments in healthcare: transitions of care. Patients being transferred from one setting to another or one clinical team to  another are at increased risk for a host of failures including identification errors, delayed or missed diagnoses, redundant testing, treatment delays or errors, medication errors, and unexpected clinical deterioration. Yet, ensuring the safety of patients during transitions of care has long been one of the biggest challenges facing the healthcare system. CHIRAL aims to improve patient safety at the time of transition through three interrelated and synergistic project based at YNHH. In the first project, we will redesign transfers of patients into our hospital from outside hospitals and emergency departments (EDs). In the second project, we will redesign transfers within our hospital: between our ED or intensive care unit (ICU) and general hospital units. In the third project, we will redesign transfers out of our hospital to the community. All projects will examine transitions through similar conceptual lenses of shared sense making (a collective ability to make sense of complicated, dynamic and ambiguous information without oversimplifying or ignoring discordant data) and latent systems conditions (considering the influence of workflow, skills, culture, staffing patterns, equipment, incentives and information technology). All projects will take a similar design and engineering approach to clinical redesign,  beginning with in-depth problem analysis, then preceding through design (brainstorming), development (prototyping), implementation and evaluation phases. Projects will make use of a central Administrative/Operations core, a Simulations core, and an Informatics core. CHIRAL will be closely aligned with hospital and university quality and safety efforts, which will expand its influence and impact."
"9449206","The global burden of tuberculosis (TB) stands at ~9 million cases per year; and South Africa is the most heavily TB-burdened country globally. TB is also the most common opportunistic infection in HIV-infected persons and it is responsible for 21% of deaths in South Africa. A program of active TB case finding and drug resistance typing in both urban and rural communities is needed to disrupt TB transmission, yet we currently lack accessible point of care diagnostics to achieve this goal.  Particularly in rural South Africa, where TB infection is widespread, microscopic examination of a sputum smear is the most accessible method for detection of TB. Two major challenges are 1) the more accessible microscopy methods have a current limit of detection of 10,000 bacilli per ml of sputum which prevents early detection and allows continued spread of infection, and 2) no methods using bright field microscopy are available for detecting drug resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis genotypes.  In this proposal Vanderbilt University and The University of Cape Town form a partnership to develop and test bright field microscopy methods for diagnosing TB from sputum. We propose to develop simple methods to improve the limit of detection of existing and more accessible bright field microscopy of sputum samples to 100 bacilli/ml. Our approach is based on a magnetic concentration strategy and high density deposition onto a standard microscope slide using the coffee ring phenomenon (Aim 1). Secondly, we propose to develop a dendrimer-genotyping probe followed by a silica condensation reaction to enable bright field identification of drug resistant phenotypes (Aim 2). These laboratory designs are then packaged into a simple kit format for initial clinical testing of retrospective sputum samples in a laboratory as well as in rural South Africa (Aim 3).  When completed, these simple modifications to the current widely accessible microscopy methods will identify individuals with low numbers of M. tuberculosis bacilli present in their sputum and enable much earlier treatment. In addition, enabling the identification of drug resistant bacilli by bright field microscopy will provide an earlier means to begin more aggressive therapies and further prevent the spread of drug-resistant TB."
"9569826","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT:  CairnSurgical LLC, a Dartmouth spin-off company, will optimize and test multi-site clinical feasibility of a new image-guided intervention device, the Breast Cancer Locator (BCL), in breast conserving surgery (BCS) to (i) eliminate wire localization - a moderately effective, somewhat costly and certainly inconvenient procedure for patients and surgeons - and concomitantly to (ii) reduce positive margin rates and subsequent re-excision surgeries - a significant but unnecessary burden not only on patients but also on the cost of healthcare. Specifically, BCL is a patient-specific, 3D printed device that allows accurate clinical transfer of multiple surgical cues not available through other competing technologies currently available, including i) a tumor silhouette projected on the breast surface as viewed from the incision site, ii) an intra-operatively placed wire that defines a direct path to the tumor from the incision site, iii) interstitial inking of the maximum tumor extents using an innovative system of access ports, and 4) distances from the anterior tumor edge to breast surface and the posterior tumor edge to the chest wall. In the proposed Phase II studies, CairnSurgical will collaborate with Dartmouth researchers and surgeons at four partnering institutions to 1) improve BCL model creation process efficiency by eliminating the need for optical scanning and clinically validate the approach in a 10- patient study at Dartmouth, 2) develop BCLPlanner software to streamline BCL creation and quality assurance processes, and optimize BCL production, packaging and delivery to achieve manufacturing and scale-up efficiencies, and 3) test the feasibility of BCL at four distant clinical sites in approximately 12 patients with palpable breast cancers. Quality assurance and validation data (both clinical and non-clinical) obtained from these studies will support 510(k) regulatory filing for the BCL device. Positive margin rates associated with contemporary BCS are high (~22%-42%)9-13, and cause significant strains on patients and the cost of breast healthcare. Meta-analyses of the impact of surgical margins on local recurrence also confirm that negative margins have a positive prognostic effect. Thus, CairnSurgical is well positioned to explore and commercially develop a potentially practice-changing approach to BCS for accurate resection of breast cancers."
"9383269","Achromatopsia is a heritable, blinding disease characterized by cone photoreceptor dysfunction and retinal degeneration. Using next-generation sequencing, we discovered novel mutations in the ATF6 gene in patients with achromatopsia. ATF6 is an important regulator of the Unfolded Protein Response, an intracellular molecular mechanism that protects cells from protein misfolding and endoplasmic reticulum stress. The function of ATF6 in photoreceptors and the mechanism by which human ATF6 mutations cause cone dysfunction, photoreceptor cell death, and achromatopsia are unknown. The objective of this proposal is to determine how ATF6 regulates photoreceptor cell survival, and why mutations in ATF6 cause retinal degeneration in patients. To understand the role of ATF6 stress in retinal degeneration, we will: 1. Determine the role of ATF6 in human retinal development, 2. Determine the mechanism of retinal degeneration in Atf6-/- mice. 3. Identify the biochemical mechanism for the pathogenicity of human ATF6 mutations. ATF6 is a novel gene required for healthy retinal function in people. Our research is expected to elucidate the function of ATF6 in photoreceptors under normal and diseased conditions. Our studies will have a positive impact by revealing why ATF6 mutations cause vision loss and identify new environmental and pharmacologic strategies to prevent retinal degeneration in affected individuals."
"9445277","Project Summary/Abstract  Latino children with asthma have worse outcomes from their asthma than non-Hispanic white children. In the medical literature, the degree to which these outcomes are the result of limited access, underutilization, poor quality of care, or social & environmental factors is unclear. A fuller understanding of asthma outcomes in Latino children is hampered by scientific evidence that has relied upon cross-sectional studies with a limited time capture, or subjective surveys vulnerable to response biases. Additionally, some evidence in the health services literature suggests that social determinants of health (individual- and community-level economic, social, and environmental factors), including Hispanic subgroup (Mexican ancestry, Puerto Rican ancestry, etc) affect asthma care and outcomes. It is uncertain, however, which social determinants are most strongly associated with Latino children's asthma care.  The proposed project intends to fill these gaps in knowledge regarding the nature of asthma care disparities in Latino children and the relative contribution of social determinants of health to these disparities, by utilizing an objective, longitudinal, and robust linkage of data sources encompassing thousands of vulnerable children across multiple states. We will leverage a unique data resource from a large, national network of community health centers with shared electronic health record data that is linked to community-level social determinants of health data. This large, longitudinal dataset contains unprecedented data linkages which will let us assess disparities in asthma care, evaluate which social determinants affect utilization and disparities, and determine which of these may do so most significantly over time. We will also specifically develop methods to use community Hispanic subgroup information to estimate the individual subgroups of patient seen in our clinics (which is information not usually present in electronic health records), and how preventive service use differs among these groups  Understanding the relative impact of social determinants of health on asthma care in Latino children will: 1. Enable more informed policy decisions to improve the care of this vulnerable population, 2. facilitate strategic partnerships between healthcare providers and community agencies poised to intervene in social factors in the lives of Latino children, and 3. help clinical providers understand their patients' barriers to care utilization, and further point-of-care efforts to address the barriers that influence children's utilization of recommended health care services for their asthma."
"9380643","Project Summary To understand visual function and cellular metabolism in the living eye, we need a means to visualize individual cells and assess molecular dynamics non-invasively. Some of the key molecules involved in the visual cycle and cellular energy production are intrinsically fluorescent, but are inaccessible in the living eye through single-photon excitation because the needed wavelength range is not transmitted by the optics of the eye. Two-photon excited fluorescence ophthalmoscopy (TPEFO) can excite these otherwise inaccessible fluorophores with near-infrared light. In our previous experiments in the living macaque eye, we used an adaptive optics scanning light ophthalmoscope (AOSLO) to non-invasively image many different cell classes throughout the retina, including ganglion cells (Sharma, Williams et al., 2016). Additionally, we measured visual cycle function by characterizing the time course of two-photon excited fluorescence from photoreceptors (Sharma, Schwarz et al., 2016). We now propose to expand the capabilities of TPEFO in the living rodent and macaque eye to measure several important fluorescence properties, such as emission spectrum, fluorescence lifetime, and redox ratio, which may be indicators of cell health and function. This research has the potential to provide insight into normal and altered biochemical processes and improve our understanding of diseases that impact retinal metabolism and function such as glaucoma, macular degeneration and Leber hereditary optic neuropathy."
"9554047","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term goal of this project is to identify clinical and genetic features of retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) development, and to analyze their relationships. Although biomedical research data are being generated at an enormous pace, much less work has been done to integrate disparate scientific findings across the spectrum from genomics to imaging to clinical medicine. Our overall hypotheses are that genetic factors are involved in the initiation and modulation of ROP, and that analysis of relationships among clinical, imaging, and genetic findings in ROP using bioinformatics approaches will improve understanding of disease pathogenesis and diagnosis. These hypotheses will be tested using three Specific Aims: (1) Recruit, phenotype, and collect genetic material from ~600 additional premature infants at-risk for ROP from 8 centers. This renewal will continue work from the original project, to obtain a total cohort size of >1600 infants for genetic analysis. Demographic and clinical features from serial ophthalmic examinations will be ascertained fully, retinal images will be captured, rigorous reference standards will be established, and blood samples will be collected. (2) Perform imaging and informatics analysis of this cohort. This will: (a) Create quantitative indices for computer- based diagnosis of severe ROP. Features from automated image analysis that best correlate with severe ROP and plus disease will be identified, and quantitative indices will be defined and validated for clinical use. (b) Combine this into disease prediction models incorporating the effects of quantitative image traits, clinical features, and environmental risk factors on ROP susceptibility. (3) Perform genetic and bioinformatics analysis of this cohort. This will: (a) analyze exome sequence data (previously obtained) from 100 phenotypically extreme subjects that were also preferentially enriched as being dizygotic twin pairs, to identify rare variants; (b) perform and analyze genome-wide genotyping to test against clinical and imaging findings, testing specific candidate genes related to vascular pathology in the eye and the vasculature at large, followed by performing a pathway-based analysis; and (c) perform bioinformatics analysis to combine findings from (3a) and (3b) in relation to the clinical findings. Ultimately, these studies should improve understanding of neovascularization in ROP and related ocular diseases, and of normal vascular development in infants. In addition, this work should demonstrate a prototype for health information management which combines genotypic and phenotypic data. This project will be performed by a multi-disciplinary team of collaborative investigators with expertise in ophthalmology, biomedical informatics, computer science, computational biology, ophthalmic genetics, genetic analysis, and statistical genetics."
"9481503","The proposed study will conduct targeted formative research to identify key social-ecological factors influencing the uptake of newly implemented syringe exchange programs (SEPs) among people who inject drugs (PWID) in rural Appalachian Kentucky (KY). The recent initiation of SEPs in this rural, resource poor area provides a unique opportunity to examine social drivers impacting uptake of an evidence-based structural level HIV prevention intervention among a highly vulnerable and understudied population of PWID, and to develop complementary intervention strategies for enhancing SEP utilization. Serious health consequences associated with opioid injection are at crisis levels: KY has the highest rate of acute hepatitis C (HCV) in the nation, particularly among persons aged ?30 years residing in non-urban areas, with a risk factor of injection drug use. In addition, a recent analysis by the CDC identified 8 counties in Appalachian KY as among the nation's top 10 most vulnerable to the rapid dissemination of HIV and HCV among PWID. Despite well- documented rural-urban differences in drug use patterns and social characteristics, there is a critical gap in our knowledge of social drivers of SEP uptake and utilization among PWID in rural communities. The implementation of structural level HIV prevention programming has been virtually absent in rural locations, and the applicability of research findings from urban SEPs is largely unknown. Such data are urgently needed to inform the continued refinement of SEP policies and practices for vulnerable rural PWID and to develop complementary multi-level prevention strategies to enhance access and utilization of rurally located SEPs. Guided by Social Ecological Theory, the Specific Aims of this exploratory mixed methods study are to: 1) Examine the uptake of SEPs in three Appalachian county HDs (Clark, Knox and Pike), through structured interviews with 350 PWID (175 SEP utilizers and 175 non-utilizers) to identify and compare the key differences between utilizers and non-utilizers in social ecological domains, including intrapersonal (e.g., HIV /HCV knowledge, rural identity), interpersonal (e.g., kinship, peer norms, social isolation); institutional (e.g., justice system involvement, law enforcement activity); community (e.g., community stigma, geographic distance); and public policy factors (e.g., SEP policies and practices (privacy/anonymity, hours, locations, distribution model, secondary exchange)) that influence SEP uptake and utilization; and, 2) Identify priority intervention targets and develop strategies to enhance uptake of SEPs among rural PWID, by conducting in-depth qualitative interviews with a strategically selected sample of PWID from Aim 1, as well as key health departments directors and SEP staff, local substance treatment providers, law enforcement, and other community stakeholders, to assess multi-level barriers to SEP utilization, acceptability and feasibility of complementary intervention strategies, and to develop recommendations for intervention priorities and practice changes to improve SEP uptake."

"9444108","Abstract: Hemodynamic signals allow us to non-invasively assay neural activity and could provide great insight into neural changes during postnatal development. However, it is not clearly understood how neural activity is related to changes in blood flow and oxygenation in the neonatal and juvenile brain. Previous studies in anesthetized animals and sedated humans have come to conflicting results as to the sign and magnitude of neurovascular coupling, and this unresolved issue has stalled the use of hemodynamic imaging in infants and children. In this proposal, we will determine how neurovascular coupling changes during postnatal development in the somatosensory cortex of the awake mouse brain, how this change in neurovascular coupling impacts BOLD fMRI signals, and how behavioral state can alter neurovascular coupling. We will use a multimodal approach, combining optical imaging (intrinsic optical signal imaging and 2-photon microscopy), electrophysiology, and fMRI to elucidate the relationship of hemodynamic signals to neural activity from the levels of single vessels up to the whole brain. We will mechanistically dissect the roles of local neural activity and cardiovascular effects on hemodynamic signals. The research proposed here will enable the use of hemodynamic imaging to study neural activity, plasticity, and neurodevelopmental disorders in infants and juvenile humans and animals."
"9303616","Asian-Americans (A-As) are under-represented in chronic disease research, including lifestyle interventions. A-As are 42% of population in Hawaii and across the U.S. they are projected to more than double to 34.4 million by 2060 with a much higher proportion of older A-As compared to other races. Within A-As, Filipino- Americans have the highest risk for hypertension, diabetes, and chronic kidney disease, especially as they age. This is largely due to unhealthy diets, high BMIs, sedentary behaviors, and low physical activity (PA). Our previous work found Filipino seniors are under-active and spend > 8 hours a day in sedentary time (ST). About 90% of Filipinos in Hawaii are Catholic and previous PA interventions involving faith-based organizations have been shown to be culturally relevant for ethnic minorities and can effectively increase PA. Our innovative application focuses on changing both PA and ST in 250 Filipino lay leaders who represent their parish within the Oahu Council of Filipino Catholic Clubs (OCFCCs). OCFCCs maintain Filipinos? Catholic traditions and their cultural heritage. This project builds on our previous research with Filipino leaders from these clubs, and our expertise with effective PA and ST interventions. Team includes 3 nursing faculty, 1 medical school faculty, a project director, and from 9-12 graduate /undergraduate nursing students. The students will participate in a community-engaged 3-yr research project relevant both to their future research efforts and their use of self- management strategies with patients who at-risk for chronic diseases. We will develop, implement, and test the efficacy of a culturally tailored PA/ST intervention for under-active/sedentary Filipino seniors (ages: 55-75 yrs) some of who may have multiple morbidities-under medical control. We will initially strengthen our partnership with OCFCC by engaging council members in semi-structured meetings where key cultural and familial issues that hinder/facilitate PA/ST will be discussed, the project?s name/logo will be created, and plans to facilitate clubs? engagement across 3-year project will be solidified. Specific Aims: 1 test the efficacy of a Light-to- Moderate PA (LMPA)/ ST intervention with ten OCFCC clubs (25 lay leaders/club; n = 250 total) that will be randomly assigned to either a 12wk LMPA/ST intervention consisting of 3 group discussions during club meetings plus 12 counseling calls, or to Delayed Treatment condition initially given health education materials and 12 contact-matched calls on topics unrelated to PA/ST; then, the LMPA/ST intervention. 2 test mainten- ance of LMPA/ST 12 wks after LMPA/ST intervention ends. 3 analyze LMPA/ST self-report & accelerometer data collected at baseline, 12, 24, and 36 wks, and test demographic, psychosocial, environmental, and group factors as mediators/moderators of change in LMPA/ST. 4 discuss project findings with statewide Diocesan Congress of Filipino Catholic Clubs and the feasibility of using lay leaders to change the LMPA/ST of their parishioners from churches across Hawaii via a train-the-trainer lay leader model.

"9425234","In mammals, behavioral and physiological processes display 24-hr rhythms that are controlled by circadian oscillators located in the hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN). The SCN acts as a master pacemaker at the top of a hierarchy of circadian oscillators distributed throughout the body. Although the SCN is a relatively small nucleus in the brain containing about 10,000 neurons on each side, it is composed of many cell types. Two major classes of neuropeptide-containing neurons, VIP (vasoactive intestinal polypeptide) and AVP (arginine vasopressin), are enriched in the ?core? and the ?shell? regions of the SCN, respectively. It is known that the VIP and AVP neurons can subserve different functions, however, it has not been possible to study genetically identified cell types in the SCN in real time at the cellular level.  We have developed a new generation of bioluminescent circadian reporter mice that are Cre-lox recombination dependent. Using cell-type-specific Cre drivers, these Cre-lox dependent reporters can be activated in restricted and genetically defined cell populations so that circadian properties of these cells can be studied separately from other cell types. In this proposal, we will analyze the cell-type specific circadian properties of VIP and AVP neurons within the SCN neuronal network by using a ColorSwitch PER2::LUCIFERASE reporter that has a click beetle red (CBR) luciferase fused to PER2 that switches to a click beetle green (CBG) luciferase upon Cre-lox recombination. With the cell-type restricted reporter, we can study for the first time the circadian properties of each of these neuropeptide classes of neurons in the SCN.  Here we will study the role of VIP and AVP neurons in controlling circadian behavioral phenotypes using both loss-of-function and gain-of-function circadian mutations in these cell classes. We will also use optogenetic control of VIP and AVP neurons to analyze the dynamics of resetting within the SCN neuronal network. Finally, we will use single-cell RNA-seq of SCN cells to classify SCN cell types and in labeled VIP and AVP neurons in order to determine the molecular signatures and pathways characteristic of these two cell types. Together, these experiments will provide critical new information on the circadian properties and dynamics of the SCN in order to promote our understanding the circadian system in mammals, which is critical for understanding how circadian disruption in humans contributes to morbidity associated with neurological disorders, cognition, mental health, obesity, type 2 diabetes and cancer."
"9548306","PROJECT SUMMARY The pediatric clinical trials enterprise is too slow and expensive and too disconnected from the needs of children. Nearly 60% of drugs used in children and 90% used in newborns are prescribed off-label. These problems persist despite a strong regulatory framework for advancing evidence on innovative medical products. Transformation of the system requires collaboration among public and private stakeholders and innovative reengineering of the pediatric trials system, including methods to integrate/catalyze existing expertise, resources, and infrastructure. The Institute for Advanced Clinical Trials for Children (I-ACT), an independent 501(c)3 non-profit, was launched as the instantiation of the Advisory Report from Critical Path Institute?s Pediatric Trials Consortium. I-ACT?s mission/vision are fully aligned with the goals of RFA-FD-17-014 and focus on creating an integrated resource for pediatric product development, with sustainable global infrastructure to support all phases of pediatric clinical trials. To address the FDA?s call for a Global Pediatric Clinical Trials Network (GPCTN), our specific aims are: Aim 1 (Strategy & Planning): Provide a multi-stakeholder forum for addressing existing and future challenges and opportunities in advancing pediatric clinical trials of innovative medicines and devices. Aim 2 (Tools, Best Practices & Education): Develop, curate, and disseminate tools, knowledge, and best practices and produce educational materials and programs that advance pediatric clinical trials on innovative medicines and devices. Aim 3 (Infrastructure & Trials Execution): Create and continuously improve a sustainable global infrastructure dedicated to rapid and successful execution of pediatric clinical trials of innovative medicines and devices. These aims subsume the 13 core functions for the GPCTN in the Advisory Report. I-ACT will lead the Administrative and Strategic Core of the GPCTN, ensuring successful execution of all network activities. PEDSnet will be the Data and Learning Core. PEDSnet is composed of the nation?s leading children?s research hospitals and condition-specific networks and provides hundreds of clinical sites and a resource (5.3M children) for data-driven feasibility and observational studies. Critical Path Institute, will lead the Regulatory Science Core and projects in key populations (e.g. newborns, rare diseases) and drug development tools. The National Capital Consortium for Pediatric Device Innovation, funded by FDA, is one of the strongest and successful pediatric device research networks in the world, and will lead the Device Core. I-ACT includes numerous global stakeholders whose commitment and expertise are essential GPCTN resources. The GPCTN will have the capacity to meet the demands of 50% of pediatric trials of innovative medicines/devices. Our approach will ensure that pediatric plans/protocols are created and conducted to enable timelier pediatric labeling, with a focus on outcomes. Our approach creates change that is inclusive of stakeholder perspectives but not limited by tradition. We will improve the child health value of projects to get it right the first time, producing a transformed and integrated global pediatric clinical trials infrastructure."
"9387916","PROJECT SUMMARY  Obesity and insulin resistance are factors associated with increased risk for and worse outcomes from endometrial cancer (EC). African American (AA) women suffer a higher mortality from EC than Caucasian (CAU) women, and this may be in part due to greater rates of both obesity and diabetes among AA versus CAU patients. Given that the gut microbiome differs by race and has been implicated in the underlying biology of both obesity and cancer, bacteria in the gut and uterus may be logical contributing causes for the racial and obesity disparities seen for EC. A significant gap in our knowledge is that the microbiota of the malignant uterus has not been previously characterized. We hypothesize that the EC microbiota exists, differs by obesity and race status and contributes to the pathogenesis of EC.  In our LKB1fl/flp53fl/fl mouse model of endometrioid EC, diet-induced obesity promoted tumor progression, resulting in a doubling of tumor size. Metabolomic profiling revealed significant differences between the ECs in obese versus lean mice, including enhanced energy metabolism and increased gut- microbiome associated metabolites in obese mice. The diabetes drug metformin had heightened efficacy in obese mice, via reversal of the detrimental effects that obesity had on both the gut microbiome and upregulation of energy metabolism. Our pilot study foundational for this grant proposal assessed the microbiota in 21 early stage endometrioid ECs of women and found that bacteria exist in the uterus of the post- menopausal woman. EC microbiota diversity was greater in the tumors of AA versus CAU women, and tumor microbiota profiles were distinct between ECs of obese and lean women. A phase 0 clinical trial of metformin in obese EC patients showed that response to metformin (defined as a decrease in tumor cell proliferation) aligned with greater impact on gut microbiome-associated metabolites. Thus, our preliminary work in both mice and women support a potential critical link between obesity, race, the microbiome and EC.  Thus, using our clinically relevant genetically engineered mouse model of obese EC, we will determine in Specific Aim 1 if the microbiota profiles differ between the normal and malignant endometrium in obese and lean post-menopausal, ovariectomized mice. In parallel, in Specific Aim 2 we will expand on our pilot study and assess if the microbiota differ between ECs of non-obese and obese post-menopausal AA and CAU women (N=160 total, 40 per group). Metabolomic profiling will be performed on the ECs from mice and women so as to elicit corresponding function related to obesity- and race-driven differences in the uterine microbiota. Overlay in the techniques of microbiota and metabolomic profiling as well as cross-species comparisons will facilitate discovery of the mechanisms of differing bacterial presence that occur with obesity and AA race in EC. This will potentially lead to microbiota-directed therapies and risk-reducing strategies that will improve outcomes for AA EC patients, which is a public health goal that aligns with the mission of the NIH/NCI."
"9420111","Project Summary/Abstract According to the BRAIN 2025 working group report, there is a need to drastically improve the spatiotemporal resolution of positron emission tomography (PET), in order to facilitate the translation of new tracers that target neuroreceptor function and dynamic PET imaging on the milliseconds timescale. To address this challenge, we propose to demonstrate feasibility of a next generation annihilation photon detector module that, if successful, will serve as the fundamental building block of an advanced brain-dedicated PET system to be developed in follow-on work after this feasibility stage. This next-generation system design shows promise to transform the capabilities of PET in human neuroimaging through substantial (>10-fold) boosts in reconstructed image signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and contrast-to-noise ration (CNR). Besides employing a smaller system diameter (e.g. 32 cm diameter) compared to the standard whole body PET system, this proposed enhancement is enabled by two unique features proposed (1) 100 picosecond (ps) coincidence time resolution (CTR), and (2) the ability to measure the energy and three-dimensional (3D) position of one or more annihilation photon interactions in the detector. These two new capabilities are achieved through a highly innovative scintillation detector configuration described in detail in the proposal. By precisely measuring the flight time of annihilation photons from their emission point within the patient to the detectors, the time-of-flight (TOF) PET technique enables a significant image SNR and CNR boost because it allows more events to be placed closer to their true point of emission along detector response lines of the system during the image reconstruction process. The key to better TOF-PET performance is to improve the annihilation photon pair CTR measured between any two detection elements in the system. Current commercially available PET systems achieve a CTR of roughly 350 to 800 ps full-width-at-half-maximum (FWHM). The proposed goal of 100 ps FWHM CTR alone represents a significant PET technology advance. But the novel detector configuration proposed also enables another capability not possible with the conventional PET detector. Owing to the fact that most incoming 511 keV photons undergo inter-crystal Compton scatter in the detectors, we can exploit the kinematics of that process to estimate the photon angle-of-incidence. If successful, that capability enables us to accurately position the first interaction of such multi-crystal events, but also offers the possibility to retain a high fraction of photon events that are normally rejected by a conventional PET system, such as single (unpaired) photons, random coincidences, tissue-scatter coincidences, and multiple (>2) photon coincidences. Since these normally-discarded events are over 10-fold more probable than true coincidence events in a standard PET study, this 3D position sensitive detector technology shows promise as another method to greatly boost photon sensitivity, and thus reconstructed image SNR. In this project we will design and develop two next-generation PET detectors and integrate them into MRI-compatible detector modules. The performance of these modules will be characterized outside and inside a 3 Tesla clinical MRI system to demonstrate feasibility of this concept."
"9430880","SUMMARY  Lewy body diseases, characterized by the accumulation of ?-synuclein in Lewy body structures, encompass a group of disorders with wide clinico-pathological variation, including Parkinson's disease dementia (PDD) and Dementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB). Most patients with a dominant dementia have cortical amyloid deposition, and several retrospective studies suggest that distribution and severity of Lewy body pathology impacts on clinical phenotype. Differentiation between the main synucleinopathies is based on the type and timing of clinical manifestations, with predominance of extrapyramidal motor features in PD patients and dementia in DLB cases; however, in some patients, appearance of dementia and motor impairments temporally overlap, confounding diagnosis. The lack of specific biomarkers and the co-occurrence of multiple concurring neurodegenerative syndromes in elder patients hamper determination of clinical subtypes.  Epigenetic alterations, including DNA methylation and histone post-translational modifications are emerging as important contributors to neurodegenerative pathology as they have a major impact on modulating brain transcriptomes. We have previously reported alterations in DNA methylation associated with PD pathology, however, the precise epigenetic changes associated with Lewy body pathology and progression are not yet defined. Importantly, despite the impact that these alterations could potentially have on disease trajectory, they have been overlooked in the design of biomarkers and as potential outcome measures.  We propose to conduct an exploratory study of DNA methylation patterns associated with DLB and PDD that will provide crucial preliminary data supporting larger studies. Importantly, we will investigate specific methylation changes in blood, searching for unique signatures that may discriminate closely related Lewy Body diseases. Development of a biomarker that aids in diagnosis of patients at early stages of neurodegeneration and that differentially diagnose cases presenting overlapping symptoms could ultimately improve disease management and therapeutic outcomes."
"9470262","PROJECT SUMMARY Alcohol use disorder (AUD) has many risk factors, both environmental and genetic, and represents a complex behavioral trait producing profound biomedical and social consequences. Identifying genes that engender AUD risk and contribute to the underlying neurobiological mechanisms represents an important first step in designing effective treatments. Published and preliminary studies make it apparent that chloride intracellular channel 4 (Clic4) expression has a major influence on ethanol sensitivity, a major risk factor for alcohol dependence in humans. Recent unpublished data has also defined a role for Clic4 in determining ethanol preference and intake. Together, these studies underscore the potential impact of Clic4 on the molecular basis of AUD and validate further investigation. In the work proposed here, Clic4 will be deleted separately in neurons and oligodendrocytes in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) of mice and the cell type-specific roles of Clic4 in drinking behavior, ethanol sensitivity, and anxiety-like behavior will be evaluated. These deletions will be performed through stereotactic microinjection of AAV-Cre into adult Clic4-floxed mice. Behaviors will be evaluated using 3-bottle-choice intermittent ethanol access, loss of righting reflex, and the light/dark box test. In addition to describing the role of Clic4 in ethanol-related behavior, a novel and impactful characterization of its mechanisms will be conducted. CLIC4 has been shown to translocate to the nucleus and interact with transcription factors thereby altering gene expression. Studying the ethanol-Clic4 interactome by manipulating Clic4 in the presence of ethanol could reveal the mechanistic framework underlying its role in ethanol-related behavior. This potential will be evaluated by characterizing the transcriptomic changes in the PFC that follow ethanol exposure in mice deficient for Clic4 in neurons and oligodendrocytes. Cell type-specific deletions of Clic4 will be performed in adult mice using a tamoxifen-inducible Cre/loxP system. RNAseq will provide identification of differential gene expression and downstream bioinformatic analysis will identify enriched biological pathways and relevant gene networks. The studies defined in this proposal will characterize the extent which Clic4 modifies ethanol-related behavior and provide an important first step towards understanding the mechanism."
"9410112","PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT  The objective of this Phase II proposal is to further develop a novel device for ocular anesthesia based on thermo-electric cooling. Intravitreal injection therapy (IVT) is one of the most commonly performed procedures in all of medicine, with approximately 7 million injections in the USA in 2016. Ocular anesthesia is required, both for patient safety and for tolerability of these vision-preserving injections. To date, all local ocular anesthetics are lidocaine based and function via diffusion of this medication through ocular tissues. Drug diffusion into deeper ocular layers and nerve endings takes between 5-10 minutes and is associated with corneal epithelial toxicity, resulting in post-injection pain and blurred vision.  To address the limitations of currently available ocular anesthesia, we have created a device that uses precisely-regulated cold temperatures to deliver focal, ultra-rapid, non-pharmacologic anesthesia to the ocular surface immediately before IVT administration. Pre-clinical device safety testing did not show any evidence of toxicity in rabbits. In addition, our early feasibility study demonstrated proof-of-concept and confirmed safety in humans, with effective anesthesia and no toxicity in study subjects.  In this proposal, we aim to further optimize temperature and time point settings of our novel focal anesthesia by thermo-electric cooling (FAnTEC) device in an expanded phase II feasibility study. Data obtained from this trial will be used to design the commercial-ready prototype with a simplified user interface, and this device will be tested in a pivotal phase III clinical trial to support FDA device approval. If successful, this project will lay the groundwork for device manufacturing and commercialization of the FAnTEC device, improving the IVT experience for millions of patients receiving IVT in the United States and around the world. !"
"9330799","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In the U.S., teen unintended pregnancy and STIs remain at epidemic levels. Rates of teen fatherhood are especially high among non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic teens. Initiatives to prevent teen pregnancy have focused primarily on female adolescents; how to effectively counsel young men to reduce their risk of fathering a teen pregnancy is unclear. We proposed to adapt, implement and rigorously evaluate an innovative computer-assisted motivational interviewing (CAMI) intervention, originally designed and implemented with girls, for use with young men, age 15-24 years old, to reduce their risk of fathering a teen pregnancy. We will use qualitative methods to modify the CAMI for use with young men. Then we will enroll 646 young men, ages 15 to 24 years, from 2 inner city high schools, a young men's clinic and from community agencies and randomize them to either a modified CAMI aimed at Teen Pregnancy Prevention (CAMI-TPP) or a CAMI aimed at diet, physical activity and tobacco use (CAMI- Fitness). The CAMI-TPP group will receive four, 30-minute MI coaching sessions over 12 weeks and one 30 minute booster at 6-months with a MI coach; sessions will be guided by a computer- generated, feedback aimed at increasing condom use, supporting female partners' contraceptive use, and completing a reproductive health visit with STI testing. The CAMI-Fitness group will receive four, 30-minute MI coaching sessions over 12 weeks and one 30 minute booster at 6-months with a MI coach; sessions will be guided by a computer-generated, feedback aimed at diet, physical activity and tobacco use. Both interventions are identical in length and timing but vary in the target behavior (pregnancy prevention versus fitness). We will track the two groups of young men through a 12 week intervention phase and a 12-month follow-up phase to assess differences in sexual and contraceptive behaviors by group. The specific aim of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of the CAMI-TPP compared to CAMI-Fitness in reducing sexual behaviors that increase the risks of fathering an unintended teen pregnancy by increasing condom use and female partner use of moderately and highly effective reversible contraception. We hypothesize that the CAMI-TPP will increase the proportion of participants who report condom use at last intercourse as well as female partner use of contraception. We also predict that those who receive CAMI-TPP will report higher completion of a reproductive health service visit with STI and/or HIV testing over the course of study participation compared to those in the CAMI-Fitness group. If proven effective, the CAMI-TPP could be broadly implemented as a method to decrease the risk of young men fathering a teen pregnancy."
"9567645","PROJECT SUMMARY Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most common inheritable form of cognitive impairment and the leading known genetic cause of autism. FXS is caused by the loss of expression of the fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP). A major challenge for FXS research is to develop treatment strategies that improve the intellectual capabilities of patients. Dysregulated protein synthesis is widely accepted as a core molecular abnormality associated with FXS. Because neuronal protein synthesis is critical for learning and memory, altered synaptic translation is considered a major contributor to the intellectual deficits seen in FXS. Currently available pharmacological intervention strategies for FXS primarily treat behavioral problems and have focused largely on targets upstream of translational control to normalize FXS-related phenotypes. We have identified a specific target that is a common downstream effector of both mTORC1 and ERK signaling and plays a direct role in regulating translation. Genetic deletion of the target in an animal model of FXS corrected exaggerated protein synthesis and other biochemical, neuroanatomical and behavioral abnormalities associated with FXS. These results suggest a strategy for developing a disease modifying therapeutic for FXS. By using a rational design approach that combines structural protein information and optimal ADME properties, we have discovered a novel series of potent inhibitors. Epigen has developed specific and drug-like small molecule inhibitors to this target, as exemplified by lead compound EPGN1370. We have teamed up with Dr. Alysson Muotri's laboratories at UCSD to propose a novel discovery paradigm for effective drug candidate compounds for FXS by using newly developed cerebral organoids, or ?mini-brains? to model the disease in 3D in the laboratory. The goal of this phase 1 SBIR work is to conduct focused lead optimization of our newly discovered series of novel inhibitors as agents to treat FXS. In this work, new compounds will be identified utilizing our assay cascade combining in vitro receptor pharmacology, ADME assays and mouse pharmacokinetics to select 1-3 advanced lead molecules, which will be evaluated in a human FXS ?mini-brain?. The best advanced lead identified will be evaluated in a mouse model of FXS for biochemical and neuroanatomical outcomes. This work will set the stage for detailed in vivo pharmacology assessment and IND-enabling studies in the phase 2 SBIR. Our study will open up a new avenue of target-specific drug development for Autism Spectrum Disorders such as FXS."
"9552476","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The photoreceptor synapse triad is a synaptic complex of great importance; physiologically, this is the site of the initial transfer of visual information, and the fidelity of information transfer is critically important for visual processing. The synaptic triad is characterized by the photoreceptor terminal, ON-bipolar cell dendrite and laterally distributed horizontal cell processes. Horizontal cells play a central role in generating the inhibitory receptive-field surrounds of photoreceptors and bipolar cells, as well as other, downstream retinal neurons. Horizontal cells participate in light adaptation, formation of center-surround receptive fields and generation of color opponency in retinal neurons. Vesicular-mediated transmitter release and proton secretion are leading candidates underlying horizontal cell output in the outer retina, although the cellular mechanisms and their sites of action are not yet fully understood. The long-term objective of this program is to understand the role of mammalian horizontal cells in visual information processing. This objective will be addressed by testing the hypotheses that 1) a regulated vesicular mechanism underlies GABA release and proton secretion from horizontal cell processes and their endings, and 2) horizontal cells participate in a pH-sensitive action on photoreceptors via V- ATPase, and an inhibitory GABA action on horizontal and bipolar cells. Specific aim 1 will test if a) vesicle fusion with the plasma membrane is Ca2+-dependent, and determine the b) cellular localization and functional properties of the Ca2+ channel subtypes mediating Ca2+ signaling in horizontal cells. Specific aim 2 will test if a) vesicle fusion with the plasma membrane is SNARE-protein dependent, and determine the b) cellular localization and binding partners of key vesicular and SNARE proteins mediating vesicle exocytosis, including V-ATPase, in horizontal cells. Specific aim 3 will test if horizontal cell vesicular exocytosis mediates a) a pH-sensitive action on photoreceptors via V-ATPase insertion into the synaptic vesicle and plasma membrane and b) GABA action at horizontal and bipolar cells. Experiments will a) evaluate V-ATPase activity in horizontal cell endings, b) determine if pH-sensitive horizontal cell action is mediated by V-ATPase dependent protons and/or other pH-regulating membrane proteins and c) determine if GABA mediates horizontal cell autocrine and bipolar cell feed forward action. Studies using morphological, electrophysiological and cellular imaging approaches will initially elucidate the molecular and cellular basis of regulated vesicular release and proton secretion from horizontal cells, and will determine horizontal cell action on the response properties of outer retinal neurons. Relevance these studies will further the understanding of the cellular mechanisms underlying visual processing in the outer retina, which will aid in the development of therapeutic strategies for the treatment of eye disease and injury. These objectives are consistent with the health-related goals of the National Eye Institute for the development of therapeutic approaches for the treatment and prevention of retinal disease."
"9471980","PROJECT ABSTRACT Hepatitis A virus (HAV), a member of the Picornaviridae (genus Hepatovirus), is an ancient human pathogen and a common cause of enterically-transmitted viral hepatitis globally. Long considered `nonenveloped', we discovered that HAV is released noncytolytically from infected cells both in vitro and in infected humans in vivo within extracellular vesicles that are similar in size and buoyant density to exosomes. The HAV capsid is completely cloaked by the membranes of these small vesicles, which nonetheless possess specific infectivity indistinguishable from naked HAV virions. The goal of this grant is to elucidate mechanisms underlying the biogenesis of these `quasi-enveloped' HAV (eHAV) virions and their role in the pathogenesis of hepatitis A. Extensive proteomics, virologic, and biophysical characterization of eHAV produced in cell culture demonstrate that viral capsids are selected for export in eHAV vesicles via a highly specific sorting process that is dependent on sequence in the pX domain of the VP1 capsid protein. We hypothesize (1) that the quasi- envelopment of eHAV results from budding of assembled VP1pX-containing capsids into endosomes (multivesicular bodies) in an ESCRT-dependent process mediated by specific interactions of capsid proteins with ESCRT complexes and facilitated by NEDD4-family E3 ubiquitin ligases; and (2) that cell entry by eHAV differs from naked virions and occurs within late endosome-lysosomes where membranes are hydrolyzed by lysosomal enzymes, providing capsid access to an unknown cellular receptor. In Specific Aim 1, we will map interactions of ESCRT components with VP1pX and ascertain the functional importance of ESCRT-0 and -I components in CRISPR/Cas9 knockout cells. Specific Aim 2 will determine whether catalytic activity of NEDD4-family ligases is required for eHAV biogenesis and contributes to ubiquitylation of pX or other capsid protein domains, and ascertain the extent to which core components of noncanonical `secretory autophagy' are involved in nonlytic eHAV egress. Specific Aim 3 will contrast mechanisms of eHAV vs. HAV entry, including endocytosis and endocytic transport, and define tissue tropisms of eHAV vs. HAV. Results from in vitro studies will be validated in vivo using a novel murine model of human hepatitis A. The discovery of eHAV has profoundly altered our understanding of the pathogenesis of this hepatotropic human virus and has substantial ramifications for the biology of other noncytopathic `nonenveloped' viruses, making this research of broad relevance to the field of virology."
"9428318","This UG3/UH3 proposal aims to identify and functionally validate novel genes for frontotemporal lobar degeneration with underlying TDP-43 pathology (FTLD-TDP) through the establishment of an international Sequencing Consortium and an interdisciplinary team of investigators. FTLD comprises a genetically, clinically and pathologically heterogeneous collection of neurodegenerative diseases affecting the frontal and temporal brain regions. Its diagnosis can be challenging and no treatments to slow or stop disease progression exist, highlighting the enormous unmet medical need of FTLD patients. FTLD represents 10-20% of all dementias and is clinically important because of its earlier age at onset compared to Alzheimer's disease (AD) and its dramatic impact on core human qualities, including personality, insight and verbal communication. FTLD-TDP represents the most common FTLD pathological subtype and two major genes have previously been implicated in its genetic etiology, both identified by our study team: mutations in progranulin (GRN) and repeat expansions in the chromosome 9 open reading frame 72 (C9ORF72). However, despite these major advances the cause of the disease in more than 50% of FTLD-TDP patient remains unexplained and much of the pathophysiology underlying FTLD-TDP unknown.  In the UG3 phase of this proposal, we will collect biospecimens and detailed phenotypic data from patients with pathologically confirmed FTLD-TDP and patients with clinical diagnoses of semantic variant primary progressive aphasia (svPPA) and frontotemporal dementia with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (FTD/ALS), highly likely to have TDP-43 pathology from more than 30 sites world- wide (Aim 2). Whole genome sequencing (WGS) will be performed on 625 new FTLD patients and combined with publically available WGS data on 3000 controls to comprise a genetic replication cohort. In Aims 1a+b, WGS data from the replication cohort and a previously generated discovery cohort (500 FTLD-TDP patients and 1000 controls) will be processed through an analytical pipeline developed in collaboration with other FTD consortia. Statistical analyses will subsequently nominate candidate FTLD genes and variants. In the UH3 phase of this proposal, we will prioritize and validate candidate FTLD genes using integrative genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic and statistical analyses in vivo using tissues or cells isolated from FTLD-TDP patients and controls (Aim 3) and ex vivo using human induced pluripotent stem cell models using integrative transcriptomic, proteomic, and high- content imaging assays (Aim 4). Through the discovery of novel FTLD-TDP disease genes we will provide important novel insight into FTLD-TDP pathobiology, advance the development of biomarkers and provide novel targets for therapies."
"9327852","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia, affecting an estimated 5.3 million individuals in the US alone. However, the underlying cellular and molecular pathophysiology of AD remains largely unknown. The AD brain is characterized by the presence of amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. The discovery of amyloid beta (A?) as the main component of these amyloid plaques, combined with the identification of AD-causing familial mutations in the gene encoding amyloid precursor protein (APP) led to the amyloid cascade hypothesis, which suggests that A? is the pathogenic culprit and that reducing A? load can improve or prevent AD symptoms. Growing evidence indicates that the intracellular trafficking routes of APP have a major impact on its ability to be processed by ?- and ?-secretase, in the production of A?. Here, we will address the molecular mechanisms controlling the sorting of APP through the endosomal system since recent work indicates that the endosomal membrane is likely to be a primary locale where APP interacts with its cleavage enzymes, ?- and ?-secretase. Specifically, we have obtained evidence implicating APP ubiquitination and the endosomal complex required for transport (ESCRT) in amyloidogenic processing. ESCRT recognizes ubiquitinated proteins on the limiting endosomal membrane and sorts them into intraluminal vesicles (ILVs) in the interior of multivesicular endosomes. We have identified candidate lysine residues in the APP cytodomain that undergo ubiquitination and control the ability of APP to sort into ILVs. Interestingly, mutating these residues leads to a selective increase in the generation of A?40, the more abundant and less pathogenic species of A?. Although APP ubiquitination appears to be a critical signal in its trafficking, the E3 ubiquitin ligase(s) acting on APP has not been identified. F-box and leucine-rich repeat protein 2 (FBL2) is a promising candidate as part of the Skp1-Cullin-F box (SCF) E3 ligase complex. The specific aims of this proposal will be: (i) To precisely map the ubiquitination sites of APP and determine the type(s) of ubiquitin modification bound to this protein; (ii) To investigate the role of FBL2 in APP ubiquitination at the endosomal membrane; and (iii) To determine the in vivo effects of APP ubiquitination deficiency on A? levels and amyloid plaque generation. We anticipate that the experiments detailed in this proposal will provide a better understanding of mechanisms regulating the trafficking and processing of APP through the endosomal system and identify potential new targets for urgently needed AD therapeutics."

"9298379","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The primary goal of this U01 proposal is to refine, evaluate, and disseminate a new low-cost and sustainable stepped care program for Obstetrics/Gynecology (Ob/Gyn) clinics that will improve perinatal women's treatment rates and outcomes. There is a tremendous public health need for this research as depression is the leading cause of disability among women of reproductive age worldwide. Upwards of 1 in 5 women suffer from perinatal depression. It has deleterious effects on birth outcomes, infant attachment, and children's behavior/development. Maternal suicide causes 20% of postpartum deaths in depressed women. Although the vast majority of perinatal women are amenable to being screened for depression, screening alone does not improve treatment rates or patient outcomes. Ob/Gyn clinics need supports in place to adequately address depression in their patient populations. Thus, we developed and pilot tested the Rapid Access to Perinatal Psychiatric Care in Depression (RAPPID) Program, to create a comprehensive intervention that is proactive, multifaceted, and practical. RAPPID aims to improve perinatal depression treatment and treatment response rates through: (1) access to immediate resource provision/referrals and psychiatric telephone consultation for Ob/Gyn providers; (2) clinic-specific implementation of stepped care, including training support and toolkits; and, (3) proactive treatment engagement, patient monitoring, and stepped treatment response to depression screening/assessment. RAPPID builds on a low-cost and widely disseminated population-based model for delivering psychiatric care in primary care settings developed by our team. Formative data and feedback from key stakeholders also informed the development of RAPPID. Our pilot work in real-world settings suggests RAPPID is feasible and improves depression detection and treatment in Ob/Gyn settings. Because it uses existing infrastructure and resources, RAPPID, has the potential to be feasible, sustainable and transportable to other practice settings. We propose to compare two active interventions, RAPPID vs. enhanced usual care (access to resource provision/referrals and psychiatric telephone consultation) in a cluster-randomized trial in which we will randomize 12 Ob/Gyn clinics to either RAPPID or enhanced usual care. We will compare the effectiveness of RAPPID vs. enhanced usual care to improve depression severity and treatment participation in pregnancy through 12 months postpartum among 300 patients (n=150/group, 25/clinic). We will then disseminate findings and recommendations via a multi-dimensional dissemination strategy to facilitate national uptake. Our established relationships with stakeholders boosts the potential for widespread dissemination and implementation of RAPPID. Our combined expertise in the integration of obstetric and depression care, cluster-randomized trials and Ob/Gyn make us ideally suited to implement, test and widely disseminate RAPPID. If proven effective, RAPPID will be poised for national dissemination."
"9373910","PROJECT SUMMARY A number of prevalent and currently incurable eye diseases are caused by aberrant oxidative and/or unfolded protein stress. In healthy individuals, these stresses are mitigated by the activation of stress-responsive signaling pathways such as the oxidative stress response and the unfolded protein response. After the cellular stress has been remedied, signaling through these pathways returns to basal levels. However, as an individual ages, or in the case of specific inherited mutations, the ability to effectively recognize stress and activate the appropriate signaling pathways declines5, in many instances resulting in prevalent diseases such as dry age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Thus, one approach to treat stress- related ocular diseases such as AMD would be to restore the appropriate stress-responsive signaling pathways in the eye. However, the technical capability to re-establish this signaling in a physiological context (i.e., conditional sinusoidal expression) in the eye is lacking. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop a conditional and reversible therapeutic strategy that allows experimental control of the timing and extent of expression of a gene of interest (i.e., a stress- responsive transcription factor) in the eye. Towards this end, in this exploratory/developmental project, we will use adeno-associated virus (AAV) to introduce a small molecule-regulated destabilized domain (DD) strategy to conditionally control protein abundance using mice as a model system. The expected outcomes of this R21 project are to i) validate the use of DD technology for controlling protein levels in the eye in aged mice and ii) to test whether DDs can be used in retinal cells already undergoing degeneration/atrophy. These findings will be critical to determine whether this promising, and potentially broadly applicable DD strategy can be adapted to future research projects targeted at modulating or restoring stress-responsive signaling pathways in the eye. Therefore, successful completion of this project will ultimately positively impact the treatment of currently incurable age-related and inherited eye diseases."
"9350664","PROJECT SUMMARY  Formation of a functional musculoskeletal system is dependent on the integration of contractile muscle to load-bearing tendon to bone. These tissues are initially specified independently of each other, but then seamlessly integrate as development progresses. Nevertheless, these interfaces are prone to failure from excessive mechanical loading and in many cases cannot be surgically reestablished due to differences in tissue complexity and healing. Scientists have been engineering replacement scaffolds to help restore these interfaces; however, currently used materials have poor functional outcomes. What is rarely taken into consideration in scaffold design is that tissues undergo extensive ECM remodeling during development and scar-free repair, which plays a significant role in directing cellular behavior in the formation of mature functional tissue.  Researchers investigating the biology behind musculoskeletal assembly have primarily focused on the signaling pathways that regulate cellular behavior. The current paradigm is that the interfaces between muscle and tendon (myotendinous junction; MTJ) and tendon and bone (enthesis) are established through cell ? cell interactions and reciprocal signaling between the separate tissues via secreted signals. In this essay, I provide evidence that an ECM-based template, deposited before the formation of these interfaces, is also required to direct the proper combinations between muscle and tendon and bone, expanding the role of the ECM from being primarily structural to one that is also instructive.  The role of the ECM during early musculoskeletal development has been largely overlooked due to a lack of tools. To address these challenges, my laboratory has been developing novel methods to map the composition and organization of the ECM over the course of musculoskeletal development. Recently, we demonstrated that the murine embryo could be labeled with non-canonical amino acids (ncAAs), which are powerful biochemical tools that enable the visualization, enrichment and identification of newly synthesized proteins within complex mixtures. In addition, my lab has pioneered optical clearing methods to image the 3D ECM architecture of biomarkers deep within developing and adult musculoskeletal tissues.  Together with established knockout models in which muscle-tendon patterning is disrupted, I will use these tools to test my overall hypothesis that an ECM-based template specified before tendon and muscle differentiation is necessary for the alignment and correct integration of load-bearing muscles and tendons during vertebrate forelimb development. Understanding how the links between muscle and tendon, and tendon and bone, form will provide critical insight into the mechanisms that orchestrate musculoskeletal assembly and establish guidelines for regenerative therapies that aim to restore these interfaces in diseased and damaged tissues."
"9339868","PROJECT DESCRIPTION OVERVIEW. We will build a portable instrument for diagnosing zinc deficiency by the use of a quick, painless fingernail reading taken in the field. Sequellae of zinc deficiency are a leading cause of death among toddlers throughout the world; UNICEF estimates 450,000 deaths per year. Zinc deficiency also causes stunted development of the brains and the bodies of about 17-30% of all poor children in the US.  Forty percent (21,000,000) of US school children are so poor they are given  free lunch, and neither those free meals nor their habitual home meals contain  much of the foods (red meat, shellfish) in which zinc is abundant.  One of the main reasons that zinc deficiency goes untreated is that no  one can diagnose it. To be sure, the signs of chronic, severe zinc deficiency  can be recognized: stunted physical and mental development, open sores,  loss of hair, infection proneness, fragile nails, and so on. But there is no good  diagnostic test for early-stage, moderate (i.e., treatable) zinc deficiency. Serum  zinc, in particular, like serum glucose, follows intake up and down in the short  Figure 1. XRAY fluorescence term, over hours, but does not reflect zinc nutritional status.  image of zinc in a fingernail clipping shows the uniformity We have solved the diagnostic problem. Abundant data indicate that  of the zinc across the lateral the zinc content of fingernails is a sensitive and reliable indicator of zinc  extent deficiency. Furthermore, though the zinc concentration of a nail will change  along the longitudinal (proximo-distal) dimension if one makes lasting and substantial changes in zinc intake, the zinc concentration is relatively uniform in the lateral dimension (FIG 1) and from one finger to the next (FIG 2). Our proposed hand-held, field-portable, battery powered instrument will give the diagnostic measurement of fingernail zinc in 30-60 seconds with no inconvenience or discomfort to the subject. Using our diagnostic instrument, clinicians, aid workers, teachers, and others can go from village to village (or school to school) assessing the zinc nutritional status of 100s of children every day.  Our instrument uses a miniature laser to make a brief ?spark? on the nail; the light emissions from that spark reveal the percent of zinc in the nail. This method (laser-induced-breakdown-spectroscopy, LIBS) is used in many applications, including the ?Chem Cam? that is mounted on the NASA Curiosity Rover on Mars. Besides the electricity for each measurement, there are no consumables. SIGNIFICANCE. The W.H.O., Gates Foundation, UNICEF, and the Copenhagen Consensus have all noted that zinc deficiency is 140 ppm a leading cause of death and stunted mental and physical 134 ppm 125 ppm development among toddlers, world wide. The Copenhagen Consensus have even identified dietary zinc supplementation as a leading cost-effective step to improve world health. INNOVATION. The use of LIBS to detect and quantify elements in solid media is not new, but the application of LIBS to nutritional (or toxicological) screening of people's tissues in situ is new, pioneered and patented (pending) by NeuroBioTex. While the concept is straightforward, the biology, optics, physics, and engineering are challenging. For example, incorporation of dietary zinc occurs at the growth plate, which is under the skin, between the cuticle and knuckle, so after a large and lasting increase in zinc intake, it takes about 60-90 days before the nail with elevated zinc emerges from under the cuticle. On the positive side, Figure 2/ Stability of zinc across 4 fingers and thumb is illustrated by King-Killilea atomic absorption laboratory data. Thumb and 4th finger omitted because different lengths and thus different growth eras. however, by measuring zinc along the proximo-distal length of the exposed nail, one can scan another 3-4 months of a subject's past zinc intake history. RESEARCH STRATEGY. We are partnering with some of the best laser and LIBS scientists and engineers in the world. In fact, we are opening a small NeuroBioTex facility within the Buildings of Ocean Optics, Inc. (OOi), which is adjacent to the U. C. Florida campus. This will insure that we can work closely with our UCF and OOi collaborators. The leaders in zinc nutrition, Janet King, Ananda Prasad, and Harold Sandstead will continue to guide the clinical, zinc deficiency diagnostic side of our research."
"9330917","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Familial dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is a condition that leads to heart failure and is the most common cause of heart transplantation. The molecular mechanisms of disease progression are not well characterized, and there are no current therapies available for this condition. A characteristic molecular change in DCM is decreased myofilament response to Ca2+. Thus, we hypothesized that by increasing the myofilament response to Ca2+ we may be able to prevent the development of DCM. As proof of principle, we crossed a transgenic model with a missense mutation on sarcomeric protein, tropomyosin (TG-Tm-E54K), which displays a phenotype similar to human DCM, with a transgenic mouse characterized by a constitutive increase in Ca2+-sensitivity. In these double transgenic mice, DCM does not develop. Results from our preliminary studies indicate that novel beta-arrestin signaling pathways are directly involved in signaling to myofilaments, imparting Ca2+-sensitizing post-translational modification, and improving heart function. In this proposal, we hypothesize that beta-arrestin signaling prevents the progression of and reverses DCM by improving the Ca2+ responsiveness of the myofilament. Our approach is to employ TG-TmE54K mice and treat them with the biased ligand, TRV120023, which acts as an angiotensin receptor blocker but is able to activate beta-arrestin signaling, or Losartan, an angiotensin receptor blocker. In Specific Aim 1 we will evaluate the progression of the disease before, during and after treatment in vivo utilizing serial echocardiography. We will also assess left ventricular function in vivo and morphology using hemodynamic studies and histological methods, respectively. To approach Specific Aim 2, we will employ detergent extracted fiber bundles to measure steady-state force and kinetics of treated animals and saline controls. We will also determine the mechanism behind these changes using biochemical methods where we will elucidate the signal transduction pathways activated. In Specific Aim 3 we will use biochemical methods and microscopy to examine beta-arrestin localization to fully characterize these novel signal transduction pathways. We expect that activation of beta-arrestin signaling, while blocking G- protein mediated signaling, will prevent the progression of and reverse DCM by increasing Ca2+-responsiveness of the myofilament. Therefore, results from this proposal will yield pre-clinical data for a potential treatment for DCM, as well as insight into the molecular mechanisms of heart failure."
"9536408","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): American Indians (AIs) experience a disproportionately high incidence of cerebrovascular disease (CBVD) relative to non-Indians with twice the stroke rate of the general US population. Neuroimaging techniques have shown CBVD-related brain abnormalities to be associated with disruption of neurpsychological performance. Therapy for post-stroke cognitive impairment has been challenging. Cognitive therapy involves intense, focused, regular mental activity, intellectual stimulation, and behaviora exercises that assist individuals to regain or maintain cognitive function. and reduce the risk of age-related cognitive decline and dementia after brain insult. Interactive Metronome (IM) therapy is a promising form of behavioral therapy for CBVD-related cognitive and motor function. This technology uses operant conditioning of an individual's responses through simple, repetitive motor tasks (e.g., clapping hands, tapping feet) in time with a set beat. Through visual and auditory feedback, IM addresses processing speed, attention, and immediate and delayed memory, all of which can be affected by CBVD. IM therapy can improve quality of life, physical mobility, gait, and CBVD- related cognitive deficits. The ongoing Strong Heart Stroke Study (SHSS) (1R01HL093086-01A1; Dedra Buchwald, PI) is investigating CBVD-related brain abnormalities through MRI scans on 1000 AIs from the original SHS cohort. The proposed study will capitalize on this current SHSS to conduct a randomized, controlled trial to ascertain the effects of a culturally tailored IM intervention on cognition, depression, and quality of life. We ill target SHSS participants with subclinical CVBD defined by impaired cognitive processing speed. We will select a sample of 180 American Indians age 68 to 80 years participating in the SHSS. The specific Aims for this study of older American Indians are as follows: 1) Determine if the culturally-adapted IM intervention can improve cognitive functioning among older AIs with CBVD; and 2) Estimate the impact of IM on health-related quality of life. This study will yield important insights into the relationships among cognitive and motor rehabilitation, neuropsychological assessment, and brain abnormalities that can inform treatment efforts as one way to reducing AI CBVD disparities."
"9466709","Development of a high-throughput screen to detect the effects of both pre- and post-  biotransformed compounds for enhanced content drug discovery workflows Project Summary This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will build upon our successful Phase I demonstration that substrate-free autobioluminescent signal generation can detect both the pre- and post-biotransformed metabolic impacts of therapeutic compounds from a single plate-based assay. Here, we will leverage this technology to develop a panel of industry-relevant autobioluminescent cell lines optimized for the detection of pre- and post-biotransformed compound metabolic impacts and the identification of specific detoxification pathway activation using modern three-dimensional (3D) microphysiological culture systems. These products and their underlying technology will specifically address the National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) request for novel in vivo and in vitro methods for predicting the safety and toxicities of pharmacologic agents. By optimizing this technology to function within the industry-preferred 3D microphysiological format, we will address the critical need for new methods that can both identify compound toxicity and elucidate the mechanisms through which cells mitigate the compounds? effects. The autonomous nature of this technology will increase toxicological data acquisition while preserving the critical advantage of presenting physiologically- relevant data, and reducing the cost of performance by eliminating substrates, reducing complexity, limiting hands-on operation time, obviating the need for sample destruction, and reducing the potential for measurement error. Through the validation of this technology at a scale relevant to tier 1 drug discovery screening and its comparative analysis against the existing gold-standard ATP content assay, this revolutionary approach is poised to have a significant and immediate impact towards reducing the estimated $8B/year in unnecessary expenditures made by pharmaceutical companies during their development of the 48% of new compounds that fail at the Phase I clinical trial stage due to misidentification of toxicological effects during tier 1 screening. This is possible because, as demonstrated in our Phase I work, the use of our autobioluminescent technology overcomes the high economic and logistical costs of existing, traditionally-bioluminescent cell?s requisite chemical substrate addition, which must co-occur with each generation of signal, and the intensive hands-on time necessitated to scale cultures due to their requisite sample destruction concurrent with imaging. Similarly, our autobioluminescent technology also obviates the hurdles presented by fluorescent cell?s susceptibility to autofluorescent signal inhibition and their tendency to remain active during downturns in cellular metabolism or even after cell death. The technology and products developed in this effort will therefore be capable of significantly improving the throughput and effectiveness of microphysiological systems-based tier 1 compound screening to improve the efficiency and economics of new compound development, and ultimately, consumer safety. This will allow them to thrive in a microphysiological system market that is predicted to maintain a compound annual growth rate of 70% to exceed $1.3B globally by 2022."

"9449137","ABSTRACT  Chagas disease, caused by Trypanosoma cruzi, represents the third greatest tropical disease burden. CD affects >7 million people, causes >17000 deaths, and costs ~$8.0 billion per year in health care costs and lost productivity. Infected individuals present oxidative and inflammatory stress, ventricular fibrosis and dilatation, and eventually develop congestive heart failure.  In this project, we propose to examine a novel role of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1) in chagasic pathology and offer an innovative potential therapy. Briefly, we believe that PARP1 cross-talk with mitochondrial DNA polymerase G (POLG) effects the mtDNA integrity, leading to a decline in respiratory chain efficiency and increase in mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in cardiomyocytes and chagasic heart. Moreover, phagocytosis of ROS-induced cell debris along with PARP1-dependent metabolic switch in macrophages signals activation and proliferation of proinflammatory macrophages. We will employ innovative, fluorescence-based, assays that measure multiple functional responses in the same sample to test our hypothesis in two specific aims.  In aim 1, our objectives are to demonstrate that PARP1 activation increases the risk of clinical heart disease in infected patients, dissect how PARP1 interferes with mtDNA replisome with increasing severity of heart disease, and test that targeted delivery of PARP1 inhibitors to mitochondria preserves mitochondrial health and LV function in Chagas disease.  In aim 2, our objectives are to test that extracellular vesicles (EV) produced due to ROS/PARP1-induced cellular injury carry the immune signature of chronic Chagas disease. We will demonstrate that EVs, in a disease stage-specific manner, engage intracellular innate immune receptors of macrophages, and macrophage expression of PARP1 provides metabolic signal for glycolytic switch and proinflammatory m? activation. Importantly, we will test that controlling PARP1 activation is beneficial in silencing the tissue- destructive, inflammatory phenotype of chagasic patients? macrophages.  We believe the innovation lies in the idea of demonstrating how a DNA repair protein can disturb mitochondrial function and intensify inflammation. We will provide mechanistic insights into how these processes are linked and offer a novel therapy for preserving metabolic homeostasis and LV function in Chagas disease cases."
"9494795","The Framingham Heart Study (FHS) is a prospective, community-based 3-generational study that enrolled participants between ages 20-50 and has examined them every 2-4 years to collect extensive lifestyle, vascular, biomarker data; 9300 have GWAS. Embedded in this cohort are 1036 multigenerational families. Surveillance for AD dementia (and MCI) has been ongoing for over 4 decades. We have identified 1421 incident AD, 1767 MCI, enrolled 800+ in a brain donation program, obtained 7000+ 1.5T brain MRI, and repeated, detailed neuropsychological assessments. We have recently obtained extensive omics in ~6000 (gene expression, methylation, miRNA, metabolomics and proteomics) and genomics (50X whole genome sequences [WGS] in 4197 with pedigree-based imputation to 6554) through the NHLBI funded SABRe CVD (omics) and TOPMed (WGS) programs. We seek to leverage these rich resources (>$25 million). We propose these specific aims: AIM 1 is to examine and explain temporal trends in clinical AD dementia in the FHS cohorts. The age-specific incidence of dementia has declined over the past 4 decades among FHS participants (in press). However, the reasons for this decline remain unclear. We thus propose to continue tracking temporal trends in AD dementia and MCI through intensive surveillance, and verifying diagnoses at autopsy. We hypothesize that better education, treatment of some vascular factors and protective lifestyle changes (diet, activity, social engagement) may partially explain these trends. AIM 2 is to identify the patterns and predictors of preclinical AD within FHS families by obtaining (i) a novel circulating biomarker (plasma tau on 8000+ persons, using samples collected 5-15 years ago and repeat assay in 450) to supplement 1000+ biomarkers already available, and (ii) brain imaging with tau- and amyloid- PET, 3TMRI, including assessment of functional connectivity, tractography and blood flow, in 450 dementia- and stroke-free, FHS participants age 35-75 on whom we have (a) directly verified familial cognition and AD dementia status (both parents and all 4 grandparents were FHS participants), and also (b) have WGS and omics data. AIM 3 is to utilize the available WGS and extensive `omics' data for deep molecular phenotyping of AD. We will undertake conventional family-based WGS analyses of AD dementia and preclinical AD endophenotypes and novel high dimensional (co-expression, network, systems-based) analyses in collaboration with Drs. DeJager (PI of Accelerated Medicine Partnerships-AD, with omics data in 1200 brains), Witten (award-winning mathematician in applying graphical analysis to omics) and Levy (PI of SABRe-CVD at FHS). We will validate our findings in unrelated and multi-ethnic (Omni) FHS participants, through collaborations with other cohorts, and share all data through dbGaP and BioLINCC for analyses by others. We expect to identify new biologic pathways, drug targets and biomarkers for AD, especially those applicable to the preclinical stage of AD and those explaining promising trends in AD risk; such pathways should prove most useful for AD prevention."
"9373695","Stanford Vision Research Core: Overall Component PROJECT SUMMARY  The Stanford vision research community is comprised of an impressive array of faculty bridging all levels of vision research, from molecular to cellular to circuits to systems, from development to adult to disease. The Stanford Vision Research Core grant will bring 4 modules to this community: (1) Advanced Computing/Computational Core, (2) Device Design and Development, (3) Neurogenetics of Vision, and (4) Imaging Structure and Function. These cores will be positioned to amplify the considerable resources Stanford University is devoting to the growth of vision research, including new faculty recruiting in the Department of Ophthalmology and the Stanford Neurosciences Institute and new space allocation to wet- and dry-lab vision research, as well as commitments from the Department of Ophthalmology for additional administrative capacities. Bringing these 4 cores to this community will help us achieve a number of specific outcomes. 1) We will extend the reach of vision research among the NEI-funded investigators at Stanford: by providing core resources and services to investigators, this grant will centralize specialty capacity, allowing faculty to benefit from the ready availability of such expertise. 2) We will accelerate discoveries in these laboratories: the availability of new resources that specifically target areas of need across the vision research community at Stanford will allow research to move more quickly into new, cutting edge areas of innovation. 3) We will promote inter-disciplinary collaboration that bridges molecular through systems level vision research: The selection of these 4 cores also carries a specific intention to bring vision research at Stanford into a ?next-generation? position bridging across disciplines. Offering these tools, with cell- and species-compatible vectors, device development, advanced imaging, and the computational power to extract relevant data from these, will facilitate this bridging. Finally, 4) We will attract new faculty at junior through senior levels into vision research: by providing tools specific to vision research, and making these tools available broadly to the Stanford research community, we will facilitate entry into vision research by both seasoned investigators in other fields, and newly recruited junior investigators poised to become the next generation of leaders in vision research."
"9445688","Abstract: Cerebral palsy (CP) is the most prevalent motor disorder of childhood with complications in other cognitive impairments, affecting 3 out of every 1,000 children. Largely due to in utero or perinatal injuries to the developing brain, CP results in white matter pathology including impairments to the motor pathway. Diffusion MRI (e.g. diffusion tensor imaging, or DTI) can help characterize these white matter impairments, as well as any potential connectivity improvement during treatment. Over the past five years, we have applied high-fidelity diffusion MRI in pediatric CP patients during autologous umbilical cord blood (UCB) stem cell therapies, and developed an understanding of the impact and benefit autologous UCB stem cells have on improving functional outcome and brain connectivity in pediatric CP patients. Specifically, we have found strong evidences in relevant brain networks that: 1) brain connectivity impairments account for the motor and cognitive abnormalities in children with CP at the pre-treatment baseline, 2) brain connectivity increases have a direct impact on functional and behavioral improvements during UCB stem cell therapy, 3) brain connectivity increases beyond that of typical development trajectory have a direct correlation with stem cell dosage above a potential threshold of 1.98 x 107 cells/kg, and 4) the severity of baseline connectivity abnormalities predicts the risk of further decline and the benefit of cell therapy. It was also found that the brain connectivity increase may be associated with improved myelination during cell therapy, through additional preliminary investigations using quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM). Advancing from this solid foundation, we propose this renewal application to further develop ultrahigh resolution diffusion MRI and connectivity imaging methodologies to study the positive effect of allogenic stem cells derived from UCB (stored at the North Carolina Cord Blood Bank), which can both reach the necessary high dosage (as opposed to the limited autologous UCB stem cells) and be applied to more CP patients (rather than just the ones with UCB saved at birth). Specifically, we propose to: 1) achieve unprecedented magnetic field homogeneity based on our recent innovation on simultaneous RF reception and Bo shimming technology to enable the highest possible spatial resolution and fidelity, 2) achieve multi-band multi-shot 3D diffusion MRI acquisition with ultrahigh submillimeter spatial resolution, optimized SNR and high throughput, and 3) acquire and analyze ultrahigh resolution diffusion MRI and brain connectome maps, as well as DTI-guided myelin-sensitive QSM along white matter pathways and throughout the brain connectome, in pediatric CP patients during the course of innovative therapies using UCB-derived allogenic stem cells. It is expected that our continued and concerted efforts will greatly advance our understanding of the neural mechanisms on both connectivity impairments in children with CP at the baseline and on the impact of stem cell therapy on connectivity restorations, ultimately providing compelling evidence to help plan the best treatment options."
"9312674","Project Summary/Abstract Crude mortality has been used by the public health community as a cornerstone for defining a public health emergency. Typically mortality in emergencies is monitored by surveillance processes that are incomplete or surveys which are often done poorly and ignored where that is politically expedient. This project will attempt to establish two different techniques, both simpler than surveys, and less likely to be dismissed by critics. 1) The process of multiple source triangulation, or establishing the sensitivity of IDP and death tallies will draw upon methods used widely in TB programs and the monitoring of homeless populations in large cities, but is rarely used to assess mortality. This process of constructing a summary of all known deaths or IDP's, collecting an independent sample, and examining the overlap between the two listings can be rapid, and can potentially transcend the biases typical in death and registration records. The project will select places to enumerate and measure mortality in at least one population displaced by an acute disaster, and at least one population that is persecuted or associated with significant stigma'. 2) A statistically representative community-based surveillance network was established by RHA with the Ministry of Health in Fizi Health Zone, DRC. Community health workers recorded birth, death, and migration events. Preliminary analyses suggest that the surveillance system detected 93% of births and 87% of deaths, with a specificity >99% for both measures, and positive predictive values of 98% (births) and 91% (deaths). This project will attempt to see if a similar system can be established in the city of Goma, to monitor IDPs in an urban setting. While not applicable to all crises, IDPs in Nairobi and Jordan and other large urban centers where IDPs remain stable over months or years could potentially be monitored with this approach. Once established, collection of other desired information from a statistically representative sample could easily be added into the surveillance process. To maximize policy impact, the later years of the project will involve extensive coordination with CDC, OFDA, and other donors in an attempt to establish procedures for mortality measurement in the locations and with partners of priority to donors. Without a widespread and credible capacity to measure central outcomes like income, malnutrition, and mortality, funding of humanitarian emergencies will continue to be based more on political interests than on public health need, and successful life-saving relief operations will remain indistinguishable from ineffective efforts. By adding two new simple and inexpensive options to the toolbox of the humanitarian community, we can help develop a community focused on outcomes instead of processes."
"9349684","Project Summary The notion that pathogens acquire antibiotic resistance from members of the human microbiome is gaining traction, although this has yet to be shown directly. Antibiotic resistance and other critical functions for bacterial survival, including mercury resistance, carbohydrate degradation proteins, virulence factors, and catabolic enzymes, are transferred between bacteria through the processes of horizontal gene transfer. Despite the importance of this process for the spread of antibiotic resistance, surprisingly little is known about the scope and dynamics of HGT in natural bacterial settings. Our limited knowledge is due to the inherent difficulties of assaying the flexible portion of bacterial genomes, with most HGT-related studies focusing only on single organisms, single genes or specific components of the mobile gene pool. Comprehensive, high-throughput methods to examine the mobile gene pool are therefore needed to understand the role of HGT in natural communities at a systems-level and to identify interventions that may reduce the overall transfer of antibiotic resistance genes within the human microbiome. My overall vision is to examine the scope and dynamics of HGT in the human gut microbiome, by developing both experimental and in silico methods for detecting HGT. I will be adapt and employ single-cell technologies that induce long-range linkages in the DNA so that mobile genes can be associated with the species in which they reside. Using metagenomic shotgun data, I will develop an assembly method specifically geared towards mobile genetic elements focused on retaining the heterogeneity in genomic contexts in which mobile genes reside. I will also employ quantitative models to assign bacterial hosts to specific mobile genes. This suite of tools should provide comprehensive information on the origin, gene content and penetrance of mobile genetic elements to capture what is currently being transferred. Since the frequency of HGT in the human microbiome is unknown, I will establish baseline dynamics and further test the hypothesis that specific perturbations to our microbiomes induce horizontal gene transfer. DNA damage and cellular stress pathways increase bacterial competence and the mobilization of transferrable genetic elements. Using a combination of mouse models and studies with human subjects, I will test whether our behaviors that induce DNA damage and cellular stress, namely antibiotic use, infection, and fecal microbiota transplant, result in an increase of horizontal gene transfer and ultimately in the spread of antibiotic resistance genes.  "
"9564351","Approximately 5.2 million Americans are affected by Alzheimer?s disease (AD), and up to 13 million will be affected by 2050. At present, there is no preventive or curative treatment for AD or in age-related cognitive decline and clinical trials of cognitive-modifying compounds have not succeeded in identifying an effective treatment. Despite a lot of efforts, no candidates are available to slow down the development or even cure this devastating disease. Although most of the efforts are focusing on the amyloid and the tau pathways, we have taken a different approach and targeted oxidative stress.  Oxidative stress is a major pathogenic mechanism that underlies both the pre-clinical development and subsequent progression of AD, and one that could potentially be targeted preventively as well as therapeutically. Levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) increase during inflammation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and metal redox cycling catalyzed by A?, all processes associated with AD development. ROS-catalyzed lipid peroxidation generates bifunctional electrophiles (BFEs). We have shown that BFEs generated by oxidative stress accelerate Aß oligomerization, generating oligomers that have similar neurotoxicity and immunoreactivity as the amyloid-derived diffusible ligands. They inhibit proteosomal activity, cause mitochondrial dysfunction, and promote dendritic cell activation of T cells. Importantly, we have shown that levels of BFE adducts on proteins are significantly elevated in hippocampus of AD post mortem human brains, and correlate positively with both the CERAD plaque score and the Braak stage.  We have found that 2-hydroxybenzylamine (2-HOBA) reacts 1,600-fold faster with BFEs than lysine, preventing protein modification in vitro and in vivo. Importantly, in hApoE4 transgenic mice, 2-HOBA inhibits all the effects of BFEs described above, and prevents working memory deficit.  2-HOBA, a natural product present in buckwheat seeds, has been developed for use in humans by Metabolic Technologies, Inc. (MTI, Ames, IA). The chemical, manufacturing and control data have been generated and pre-clinical pharmacology and toxicology data are currently being collected. In this project, we propose to do single and multiple escalation dose studies necessary to characterize pharmacokinetics, metabolism, and safety of 2-HOBA. We also propose to establish brain penetrance of 2-HOBA and to determine whether it reduces blood and CSF markers of oxidative modification of proteins."
"9473315","Project Summary/Abstract (30 lines of text)  Despite our knowledge about DNA damage responses, we know significantly less about the cellular pathways activated selectively with mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) damage. In fact, when cells are exposed to DNA damaging drugs, the responses observed are likely a consequence of damage to both the nuclear DNA and mtDNA. However, separating the outcome of nuclear DNA damage versus mtDNA damage is difficult because of the challenges of exposing only the mitochondria and not the nucleus to DNA damage in cells.  To selectively expose the mitochondria but not the nucleus to DNA damaging drugs, we utilized primary neurons as their cell body (containing the nucleus) and axons (containing mitochondria but not the nucleus) are spatially distinct. We use microfluidic chambers to culture the neurons, which allowed us to expose only the axons and not the cell bodies to DNA damaging drugs such as cisplatin. Addition of cisplatin exclusively to the axons in microfluidic chambers induced mtDNA damage in axonal mitochondrial without any DNA damage to the nucleus. Importantly, cisplatin addition induced widespread axon degeneration. No degeneration was seen in the cell body or neuronal regions that were not exposed to cisplatin. Similar selective degeneration of axons was also observed when axons were exposed to other DNA damaging drugs such as the nucleoside analog d4T or the topoisomerase I inhibitor camptothecin.  In thisR21 proposal, we will focus on defining the molecular mechanism of axon degeneration induced with mtDNA damage. While nuclear DNA damage is recognized to activate a p53-depedent apoptotic cell death pathway, virtually nothing is known about the specific cell degeneration pathway activated with mtDNA damage. Thus, in Aim 1 we will investigate whether key proteins of the apoptotic pathway are required for axon degeneration in response to mtDNA damage. Specifically, we will evaluate mtDNA damage-induced axon degeneration in wildtype neurons or neurons deficient in p53, Bax, Apaf-1 Caspase-9 or Caspase-3. In addition to apoptosis, axon degeneration has been studied in the context of pruning and axotomy-induced Wallerian degeneration. Thus, in Aim 2, we will examine whether axon degeneration after mtDNA damage is mediated by either the pruning (using Caspase-6-deficient neurons) or Wallerian (using Sarm-1-deficient neurons) axon degeneration pathways. Our focus in Aim 3 is on mitophagy as damaged mitochondria are recognized to be targeted for degradation via Parkin-mediated degradation. While mitophagy is generally beneficial to neurons, excess mitophagy could also be detrimental, particularly in situations of acute mitochondrial damage. We will utilize Parkin-deficient neurons to critically evaluate whether inhibition of mitophagy accelerates or reduces the kinetics of axon degeneration with acute mtDNA damage.  Our approach of inducing mtDNA damage in axons using the neuronal microfluidic chamber model has broad relevance, as it will help define the nuclear DNA damage-independent mechanisms of degeneration."
"9391235","PROJECT SUMMARY  This U01 is in response to FOA PAR-16-105 Cancer Tissue Engineering Collaborative: Enabling Biomimetic Tissue-Engineered Technologies for Cancer Research. In it we will address the substantial gap in our knowledge of the initiation and progression of metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC). This gap is due, in large part, to the fact that current in vitro, ex vivo, and even in vivo research models are hard to establish or have limited applicability. Accordingly, our objectives are to show the utility of three innovative models of metastasis (a long-term organotypic model and a model that uses multi-organ microfluidic devices) and a new in vivo model (immunocompetent blastocyst model). Using these models, we will investigate the interactive cellular secretome, differentiation, migration and invasion of the primary and metastatic fibroblast tumor microenvironment in order to identify critical contributions to CRC metastasis. Our hypothesis is: inflammation-associated fibroblasts and altered metabolic conditions promote epithelial metastasis via transcriptional regulation. Based on our recent successful engineering of novel models, we propose 3 Aims. Aim 1. To integrate cytokine-secreting stroma into our organotypic model in order to study the influence of inflammation on cancer stem cells (SCs) and on invasion/migration cell phenotypes. Aim 2. To engineer a liver metastasis model using a microfluidic body-on-a- chip platform to study transcriptome and epigenetic reprogramming of metastatic cells. Aim 3. To validate our in vitro models using in vivo immunoproficient murine metastatic models. In Aim 1, decellularized human colons will be repopulated with normal or cancerous fibroblasts from the stroma, and cancer epithelial cells in the form of cancer SCs and organoids to ask how these manipulations influence invasion and differentiation in this model. To complement the cellular findings, we will identify alterations in the transcriptome using RNA-seq and ATAC- seq. Aim 2 uses the innovative body-on-a chip microfluidic device to test autocrine and paracrine proliferative and secretory responses under conditions that favor oncogenic progression, including hypoxia and low glucose. As in Aim 1, epithelia and fibroblasts in the different milieus will be transcriptionally profiled. Aim 3 uses a new immunocompetent blastocyst model and will undergo the same transcriptional profiling. All 3 models will be linked using comparative, informatics approaches. The approach is innovative as it uses human colon tissues in all Aims and asks about the transcriptional contribution and landscape of accessible chromatin in each model. Our multidisciplinary team includes a colorectal surgeon-scientist and biomedical engineers with expertise in cancer SCs, signaling, metastases, and organotypic and organ-on-a-chip platforms. The findings will be significant, as they will establish improved approaches for studying the pathogenesis of advanced CRC, and for developing patient-derived, high-throughput cell models to test therapeutic interventions."
"9471130","ABSTRACT The burden of prostate cancer (PCa) is substantial, and racial disparities in PCa are the largest in all of oncology. Disparities in PCa screening, diagnosis and treatment have been well-documented; however, while PCa is often slow-growing and patients face a long journey after diagnosis, prior disparities research has largely neglected the vast majority of this journey in the 3.3 million PCa survivors in the US. To optimize overall health and survival, PCa survivors need longitudinal, guideline-recommended healthcare during survivorship. The two most common causes of mortality in men with PCa are 1) cardiovascular disease (CVD) and 2) prostate cancer. There is an urgent need to study disparities in survivorship care, and it is likely that disparities in receipt of guideline-recommended care in PCa survivors directly contribute to the known disparities in mortality in this population. The National Academy of Medicine and American Society of Clinical Oncology have both called for more cancer survivorship research, a high-priority but understudied research area. This study breaks new ground in disparities research by examining survivorship care specific to CVD care and PCa monitoring. It leverages a unique, population-based, and diverse cohort of 1,455 PCa survivors enrolled at diagnosis from 2011-2013 and followed longitudinally with yearly surveys and medical records, with an innovative linkage to administrative and claims data from multiple insurance plans and health care systems, allowing unique insight into disparities in survivorship care by race, insurance/system type (Medicare/Medicaid/private/VA/uninsured), and urban/rural residence. This novel, comprehensive dataset with 3 data sources to measure survivorship care (patient report, medical records, claims) will allow the study team to achieve these specific aims: (1) To examine guideline-recommended PCa-specific survivorship care, including monitoring for PCa recurrence by race, insurance type, and patient rurality; (2) To examine guideline- recommended primary and preventive care ? emphasizing cardiovascular disease management and prevention ? by race, insurance type, and patient rurality; and (3) To examine data source concordance ? patient-report vs medical records vs claims ? for guideline-recommended survivorship care, to inform the research methodology for future studies in this area. The anticipated outcomes of this study are to provide novel insight regarding disparities in cancer survivorship care that are directly amenable to intervention; and address fundamental methodologic questions in disparities research on cancer survivorship, made possible by this study's unique dataset. All specific aims directly address known current knowledge gaps in this research area. The research team has extensive experience and expertise with cancer disparities research, analysis of large datasets (including cancer registry and claims data), and designing interventions to reduce disparities and improve the healthcare and overall health of cancer survivors. We will leverage this expertise and findings from this study to design and test interventions targeting disparities in survivorship care as the next step."
"9570504","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The UNC-CH Program's multidisciplinary research will address scientific issues that underpin the assessment and reduction of risks to human health associated with high priority chemicals at Superfund sites. The overall specific aims are to improve the scientific foundation for risk assessment, elucidate mechanisms responsible for inter-individual susceptibility, advance approaches to assessing exposure to hazardous chemicals, and more efficiently reduce risks by remediation of hazardous waste sites. In this competing continuation, we will focus on three major classes of chemicals ~ polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), halogenated hydrocarbons, and heavy metals ~ in three biomedical and two non-biomedical projects, two Research Support Cores, a Research Translation Core (RTC), and an Administrative Core. Research themes that cross multiple projects and cores include: (1) developing biomarkers of exposure and effect for human and experimental models of environmental disease over a range of exposure levels to improve low-dose quantitative risk assessment; (2) applying new molecular tools in a systems biology framework to understand metabolic pathways critical for environmental disease, predict in vivo inter-individual differences in susceptibility and risk, and evaluate complex microbial communities in bioremediation systems; (3) using advanced analytical tools to identify mechanisms of genotoxicity; (4) using advanced statistical and bioinformatics methods to evaluate gene-environment interactions; and (5) quantifying the chronic exposure and bioavailability of toxic compounds in environmental systems. This work will also be integrated by sharing methods and resources across projects and cores, by regular meetings of all researchers, and by co-advising of trainees by faculty in different projects and cores. Working with investigators, the RTC will enhance the capacity of government agencies to provide technical assistance to communities, develop improved decision-support tools, and promote the commercialization of our research products. This Program is highly relevant to Superfund by addressing high-priority chemicals and by focusing on mechanisms underlying health effects, exposure assessment, and remediation to mitigate exposure and toxicity."
"9449550","Abstract Immune therapy has shown great promise in the treatment of a number of malignancies, but has not proven fruitful in fighting pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) using current modalities. One possible reason for this is the unique biology of the pancreatic cancer in establishing an immune suppressive microenvironment. We find that cross communication between cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs), tumor associated macrophages (TAMs) and tumor cells is critical. Using animal models of PDA, we find that tumor cells polarize macrophages to TAMs both by activating CAFs to produce IL6 and by producing specific metabolites. TAMs then both suppress the immune response by arginine depletion by making Arginase 1 and by producing EGFR ligands, primarily HBEGF, to stimulate pancreatic cancer cells to express PDL1, an immune checkpoint ligand. We propose to use a combination of matched humanized patient derived xenografts (PDXs), organoid culture systems made up of cancer cells, immune cells and CAFs (ie ?microtumors?) and a unique dual recombinase genetically engineered mouse model of PDA to test the hypothesis that treatment of tumors with inhibitors of STAT3, HBEGF, ARG1 or MEK will effectively synergize with PD1 inhibition, overcoming the powerful immune suppression created by the pancreatic cancer microenvironment."
"9485172","ABSTRACT Precision medicine is the emerging practice of delivering healthcare tailored to patients on the basis of specific factors that contribute to disease risk, prognosis, and treatment response. The prospect of applying precision medicine to neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) is especially promising. Genetic markers, most notably variation in the apolipoprotein E gene, and measures of vascular brain injury and cerebral atrophy assessed by MRI have emerged as useful biomarkers of preclinical AD and risk of clinical disease. More than 3 million American Indians (AIs), Alaska Natives, Blacks, Latinos, and Asians suffer from AD, and experience earlier onset of cognitive impairment and AD than Whites. The few studies of AD in AIs are limited by small, single-community samples. We will use data from the Strong Heart Study (SHS) and ancillary Cerebrovascular Disease and its Consequences in American Indians (CDCAI) study to evaluate cognitive function, AD risk factors, and MRI-defined biomarkers of AD in older AIs. The SHS collected data from 4,549 AIs aged 45-74 years from tribes in the Southwest, Southern Plains, and Northern Plains in 3 phases from 1988 to 2000. The CDCAI study assessed cognitive function and MRI-defined vascular brain injury in 818 surviving SHS participants in 2010-2013 and is reassessing surviving participants with the same MRI and cognitive tests. We will use statistical mapping software to reprocess MRIs from both the original and follow-up CDCAI examinations and will create 3-dimensional brain maps for older AIs. We will quantify cerebral atrophy in brain regions preferentially affected by AD such as the hippocampus, parahippocampal, medial temporal, and parietal regions, and the posterior cingulate cortex. We will compare structural patterns on MRI at both CDCAI time points with normative data on AD patients from other populations. We will define probable AD cases by assessing change in MRI-defined loss in regions selectively affected by AD, in combination with AD-related cognitive test performance and activities of daily living; and examine associations of probable AD with risk factors and functional outcomes. Our Specific Aims are to: 1) establish AI-specific normative values of MRI atrophy in brain regions selectively affected by AD, and evaluate AD-related regional atrophy in combination with cognitive and behavioral changes to calculate prevalence of probable AD; 2) use genetic, sociodemographic, and clinical data on risk factors for AD observed in other populations to identify correlates of probable AD in elderly AIs; and 3) estimate associations of MRI markers of probable AD with measures of cognitive and physical function, independent of the effects of vascular brain injury. AD is the leading cause of dementia and of death in the US. The CDCAI sample is the only population-based cohort of AIs with MRI data and genetic biomarkers relevant to AD. We will leverage these unique data to address key elements of PM, namely, risk assessment and detection of preclinical pathophysiologic processes of AD among AIs."
"9316329","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application details a plan to build from and expand the work of the currently funded Chicago Center for Youth Violence Prevention (U01 CE001949-05) through the collaboration of researchers and a coalition of faith and community leaders to support a community initiated effort to reduce youth crime and violence within a target high-risk community in Chicago. Building from both the success and lessons learned from the currently funded Center, the focus of the approach proposed in this application is to move from the study of the individual and collective impact of a set of preventive interventions delivered within a single community to the implementation and evaluation of a community-level prevention system. In addition, building from previous work of this group of investigators, data from the Illinois Violent Death Reporting System and administrative data gathered from city data archives will be used to evaluate policy-level prevention strategies that are currently being implemented in the target and other high burden communities in Chicago. These data will also be used to conduct a series of studies to inform policies to reduce and prevent youth and other forms of violence. This combination of activities is designed to address critical gaps in the field and buil the evidence-base regarding effective community and policy-level prevention strategies to achieve community-level impact on youth and other forms of violence. The Center's primary aims are: 1) to build a coalition of community, policy and academic partners to address the issues of youth and other forms of violence within Chicago neighborhoods; 2) to evaluate the process and impact of implementing a community-level prevention system (Communities that Care) in a high-risk urban community and to identify unique challenges and adaptations necessary for implementation in urban neighborhoods; 3) to evaluate the diffusion and impact of CTC on neighborhood social organization and processes (i.e., collective efficacy, social organization, connection and support, norms and attitudes toward violence), processes that have been empirically linked with youth and other forms of violence; 4) to evaluate and inform current policy strategies aimed at reducing youth and other forms of violence; 5) to provide training and technical assistance to build capacity for schools and community agencies to select and implement evidence-based interventions and to evaluate existing interventions within the community; and 6) to disseminate empirical findings regionally and nationally to scientific, practice and policy communities."
"9379803","DESCRIPTION:      Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) robustly predicts anger and aggression (Olatunji, Ciesielski, & Tolin, 2010), and U.S. Iraq/Afghanistan-era Veterans report that controlling anger and aggressive urges are primary readjustment concerns (Sayer et al, 2010). Trauma-related anger and aggression are associated with functional impairments that significantly limit community reintegration (Rodriguez, Holowka, & Marx, 2012) and that may persist for decades (Koenen et al, 2003). As more troops return from multiple deployments to Iraq and Afghanistan, there is an urgent and growing need for the development and testing of psychosocial treatment for anger and aggression in combat Veterans with PTSD. VA clinicians are doing their best to be responsive to Veteran's needs by offering anger management treatment to Veterans: A survey of clinical practices within the VA conducted found that 35-65% of VA PTSD specialists report providing anger management to their patients (Rosen et al., 2004). Yet to date only one randomized clinical trial (RCT), published in 1997, has investigated the efficacy of treatment of anger and aggression in Veterans with PTSD (Chemtob et al., 1997).  A recent review noted that most researchers who have examined the effects of anger management interventions have not done so as part of a systematic program of research (DiGiuseppe & Tafrate, 2003). The proposed CDA-2 application outlines Training and Mentoring Plans that will provide the applicant with the foundation to establish a career systematically developing, testing, and refining treatments for PTSD-related anger and aggression in Veterans. The following specific Training Goals have been formulated: 1) To acquire the advanced skills in the development and evaluation of clinical interventions necessary to begin an independent research career within the VA; 2) To develop greater expertise in delivery of behavioral interventions to improve functional outcomes and community reintegration in Veterans with PTSD, anger problems, and aggression; 3) To acquire expertise in the development and evaluation of treatment innovations to help Veterans generalize treatment gains beyond the therapy setting; 4) To increase understanding of rehabilitation theory and methods in treatment practices and research; and 5) To achieve critical professional development milestones, including submission of a Merit Review proposal based on the pilot data generated from the CDA-2 project.  The Research Plan proposes a pilot feasibility trial for an RCT of Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy for Anger and Aggression in Combat Veterans with PTSD (CBT-A). CBT-A is a 12-week manualized group treatment protocol that has been designed to address the specific needs of combat Veterans whose PTSD-related anger and aggression interfere with effective community reintegration. The group was implemented with 4 male Vietnam Veterans with severe combat-related PTSD who had been referred for anger management treatment, and preliminary data were promising. The active comparison treatment for the pilot RCT will be group Present- Centered Therapy (PCT), a manualized treatment for PTSD that controls for treatment time, social support, and instillation of hope. The proposed research project will address the following Specific Aims: Aim 1: Characterize the differential effects of group CBT-A and group PCT on anger, aggression, and anger/aggression-related limitations to psychosocial functioning and community reintegration in combat Veterans with PTSD; and Aim 2: Evaluate study feasibility and treatment delivery procedures of an RCT comparing CBT-A to a PCT comparison condition. The results generated will guide the design of a full RCT to be funded by the end of the CDA-2 funding period. The research, training, and mentoring plans outlined here will provide the foundation for the PI's independent research career developing a systematic program of research in the treatment of anger and aggression among combat Veterans with PTSD. The availability of empirically-supported anger treatment would benefit the many Veterans with PTSD who return from combat reporting problems with anger and aggression."
"9321613","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is considered the most devastating neurodegenerative disease. Patients suffer progressive functional loss, including loss of speech, swallowing, mobility, and respiration that leads to death on average 2 to 4 years after diagnosis. Except for aggressive symptomatic care, there are no effective treatments. More than 50 clinical trials based on plausible hypotheses of disease mechanisms have failed except for riluzole. Identified inherited pathogenic mutations account for ~10% of all ALS cases; the cause of most sporadic cases is unknown. ALS is now considered to be potentially caused by a combination of both genetic and environmental risk factors. Our overall hypothesis is that individual environmental risk factors reported to be associated with ALS act via a common mechanism, specifically oxidative stress (OS). Our NIEHS-funded prospective multicenter cohort study of ALS (ALS COSMOS), which investigates the extent to which multiple risk factors associated with OS are also associated with ALS progression, is in its final stages. Our current ARREST ALS project expands ALS COSMOS at a national level through the National ALS Registry, using structured telephone interviews and one-time urine and saliva collection. Now, we propose a set of well-designed, high-quality, case-control studies nested within ARREST ALS. We specifically aim: 1. To evaluate environmental and other risk factors in a population-based case-control study nested within the ARREST ALS study of the National ALS Registry. The cases (150 patients) will be identified in the on- going ARREST ALS project. We will match 2 controls to each case based on sex, age (± 5 years), race/ethnicity, and geographic area of residence. We will administer our well-validated, structured interview to determine cognitive function and obtain data on early life events and environmental, residential, occupational, dietary, lifestyle, and psychological factors. Dietary questionnaire data, first-void urine samples to measure OS markers, and saliva DNA will be collected; 2. To evaluate early life and late life environmental and other risk factors in a sibling-based, case-control study. We will identify a same-sex sibling who agrees to participate and is closest in age to the case. We estimate that 80% of cases will have a sibling who meets these criteria. They will receive the same risk factor assessment and provide saliva and urine samples as the population controls. 3. To evaluate individual or aggregate environmental risk factors between cases and controls at different stages of life and to investigate the significance of the urinary OS biomarker in relation to ALS and environmental risk factors. We will analyze risk factors at different stages of life in the two control groups combined in comparison to the cases and further analyze OS biomarkers in relation to risk factors. In summary, carefully designed population-based and sibling-based case-control studies nested within ARREST ALS will reveal entirely new and unique data concerning environmental risk factors, disease progression, and the potential cause(s) of ALS."
"9394679","Project Summary Multicopper oxidases (MCOs) are a large and diverse family of enzymes which couple the one-electron oxidation of various substrates with the four-electron reduction of dioxygen to water. They are important in biological processes and are increasingly evaluated for a variety of biotechnological applications due to their broad substrate range. Human serum ceruloplasmin (Cp) is the most complicated MCO with one trinuclear copper (TNC) center and three type 1 copper (T1Cu) sites. One of the main reasons for the interest in Cp is the mutational disease aceruloplasminemia, which reveals a role for Cp as an essential ferroxidase critical for iron homeostasis. A fundamental understanding of the catalytic cycle of the MCOs has been developed based on the study of Rhus vernicifera laccase (RvL). However, the mechanism of Cp catalysis is still unclear. Preliminary studies reveal that an intermediate of Cp catalysis is different from that of RvL, and the functions of the two additional T1Cu sites of Cp are not well defined. Hence, this proposal focuses on these two important issues regarding the Cp mechanism: 1) The nature of the unique intermediates involved in Cp catalysis; 2) The roles of the two additional T1Cu sites. All the intermediates or mutants involved will be analyzed by a wide range of spectroscopic methods correlated with DFT calculations to define the corresponding electronic and geometric structures of the intermediates and elucidate reaction coordinates. The correlation of Cp intermediates to the well-defined intermediates present in other MCOs will be determined. These mechanistic studies of the Cp will advance the fundamental understanding of the structure-activity relationship of human Cp and provide valuable insight into the pathogenesis of metal-mediated diseases and mechanisms for metal neurotoxicity."
"9409180","The worldwide incidence of breast cancer is 1.68 million. Triple-negative breast cancers (TNBC) account for ~20% of total breast cancer cases (336,000 worldwide). Annually, over 40,000 new cases of TNBC are diag- nosed in the US alone. The treatment options for TNBC patients are limited. Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) includes breast cancers that lack estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, and HER-2 proteins. Lack of known targets and patient-to-patient variation of target antigens make TNBC one of the most challenging cancers for developing an effective therapy. New therapies are critically needed, as TNBC is also resistant to checkpoint blockade inhibition alone. We propose to develop an immunotherapy administered in combination with checkpoint blockade to treat metastatic TNBC using an approach that is personalized, thus incorporating patient-specific neoantigens and other tumor antigens that are upregulated or altered in glycosylation pattern, such as MUC-1. Metaclipse?s immunotherapy (autologous therapeutic vaccine) consists of Tumor Membrane Vesicles (TMVs) made  from  patient-specific  tumor  tissue,  which  carry membrane  associated  tumor  antigens and also antigenic epitopes derived from cytosolic proteins as MHC associated peptides. These TMVs are then directly conjugated to potent glycolipid-anchored immunostimulatory molecules (GPI-ISMs) by a novel protein transfer technology. The novelty of the proposed vaccine lies not in the use of ISMs, but in the way they are employed. This direct physical linkage of TMVs and GPI-ISMs allows for simultaneous delivery of the patient?s unique tumor antigen signature and ISMs at the vaccination site  to  induce  a  robust  antitumor  immune  response. Since the TMV vaccine is prepared from whole tumor tissue encompassing not only patient specific variation but also all of the heterogeneity of the tumors. A key advantage of our approach is that the immuno- therapy product can be prepared within a week, which is critical during treatment of aggressive cancers such as TNBC. The company has successfully completed proof-of-concept studies using an immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) resistant pre-clinical mouse model of TNBC. The results demonstrate that immunization with TMV vaccine sensitizes the ICI resistant TNBC to become  responsive  to  ICI  therapy.  The  SBIR  direct  Phase  II award is requested to support further IND enabling preclinical studies, which will facilitate IND meetings with the FDA to advance the TMV vaccine product to the clinic. The following are specific aims of the SBIR direct Phase II grant: (1) determine optimal dose and dosing schedule of the immunotherapy product in inducing an effective antitumor immune response, alone and in combination with immune checkpoint blockade therapy; (2) evaluate safety of the administered immunotherapy product in mice; and (3) prepare for GMP production of human GPI-ISMs and establish benchmarks for a GMP-compliant TMV vaccine product. The proposed plan represents Metaclipse?s critical path for product development to enter into a Phase 1 clinical trial."

In addition, we will use three longitudinal datasets of elderly people fielded in Costa Rica (CRELES), Mexico(MHAS) and Puerto Rico(PREHCO), all of which contain information on adult health and mortality as well as on early conditions. We will estimate a broad spectrum of mortality statistics to characterize child, adult, and old age mortality trajectories during the secular mortality decline, around 1780-2010 in Western-Southern and Northern Europe and North America (NAWE), and 1900-2010 in Latin American and Caribbean (LAC). The project is organized around two distinct tasks: (a) generalizing and fine-tuning an existing formal model to represent adult mortality patterns influenced by delayed effects predicted by DOHaD; (b) testing predictions using two databases, LAMBdA and HMD and CRELES, MHAS and PREHCO as ancillary data sets. 1 Abbreviations used throughout the text: LAMBdA Latin American Mortality Database<website> HMD Human Mortality Database<website> LAC Latin American and Caribbean countries NAWE North America and Western-North-South Europe webLAMBdA LAMBdA official web sitewww.ssc.wisc.edu/cdha/latinmortality DOAhD Developmental Origins of Adult Health and Disease"
"9309728","Summary The response of cortical cells to sensory stimulation reflects the interactions between feedforward thalamocortical input and ongoing cortical activity which can be strongly affected by behavioral states. Until recently, it has been experimentally challenging to tease apart the thalamocortical and intra-cortical pathways and their unique contributions to the sensory response. We propose to use intracellular recording together with optogenetic silencing of cortical activity to examine how thalamocortical (TC) and intracortical (IC) inputs combine to produce three hallmarks of the cortical sensory response: 1) trial-to-trial variability in the sensory response, 2) noise correlations between cortical cells, and 3) state-dependent modulation of response variability and gain. To address these questions, we will record intracellularly from layer 4 (L4) neurons of visual cortex and compare the sensory-evoked synaptic input to these cells with and without optogenetic silencing of cortical activity. It has been suggested that modulation by attention and arousal are mediated by suppression of noise correlation. The proposed experiments will determine how much variability of cortical neurons and their cross correlation are inherited from thalamocortical inputs, and whether that variability and correlated spiking are amplified or diminished by cortical processing and by behavioral state. "
"9473457","SUMMARY Recent studies have revealed that the ?epitranscriptome,? i.e., the pattern and distribution of RNA modifications in mRNA, is dynamically regulated and has functional roles in the brain. Our laboratory had a founding role in the emergence of this field with our initial transcriptome-wide map of N6-methyladenosine (m6A), which revealed that m6A is present in over 8,000 different transcripts, and is predominantly located near stop codons and in the 5'UTR of mRNAs. Although m6A has been studied in standard tissue culture cell lines, the effects of m6A on mRNA in neurons remain unclear. Our data suggests that m6A may function as a cis-acting element that targets diverse mRNAs to dendrites. We also find that FMRP, a major RNA-binding protein linked to cognitive function, may bind a subset of m6A residues, i.e., the ones in the coding regions of mRNAs. These m6A sites show high overlap with known FMRP-binding sites in the transcriptome and depleting m6A from mRNAs markedly impairs the ability of FMRP to associate with translating ribosomes, which is believed to be essential for its translation-inhibitory effect. In order to significantly advance our understanding of these novel roles of m6A in neuronal function, the specific aims of this proposal are: (1) To image m6A mRNAs: Technologies for imaging m6A-mRNA trafficking in living cells and selective detection of m6A-mRNA in fixed cells. In this aim, we will develop two methods for imaging m6A-RNAs, one for live cells and one for fixed tissue. For live cell imaging, we will use a highly optimized MS2 system to image reporter RNAs that have been engineered to be resistant or susceptible to endogenous methylation. For fixed cell imaging, we have devised FISH-FRET, a fundamentally new approach for transcript- and m6A site-specific imaging of mRNA in virtually any cell or tissue. (2) To determine the role of m6A in mRNA trafficking and local translation. In this aim, we will test the role of m6A in mediating mRNA trafficking to axons and dendrites and how m6A influences local translation at these sites. (3) To determine if FMRP controls the function of mRNAs containing m6A in the coding sequence. In this aim, we will establish if FMRP's transcriptome-wide binding properties, granule formation and mobility in neurons are affected by m6A. We will also probe how FMRP controls translation and if its translation-inhibitory effect is directed towards mRNAs that contain m6A in their coding sequence. Although m6A is a highly abundant modification in neuronal mRNA, its functions remain unclear. Our studies point to key roles of m6A in directing mRNAs to dendrites and in mediating the assembly of FMRP onto stalled ribosomes and potentially FMRP granules. Our proposed studies have the potential to fundamentally alter our understanding of local translation, mRNA trafficking, FMRP function, and RNA regulatory mechanisms in the brain."
"9568138","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Neuron-cell culture is widely used for studies in basic research, drug discovery, and toxicity testing. Traditional neuron-cell culture approaches result in random growth of processes which prevent the study of their unique polarized morphology. Our goal is to provide robust, user-friendly, and cost effective culture platforms to manipulate and access neurons and their subcellular compartments (axons, cell body and dendrites). Data acquired through sales of prototype platforms developed and patented by our team show a large and increasing demand. Because of the unique morphology of neurons and the difficulty in manipulating and studying neurons in vivo, this platform has rapidly become an important tool for cell-based experimental neuroscience. These platforms are compatible with high resolution microscopy and allow axons to be manipulated and biochemically analyzed. These prototype platforms are currently replica molded using an optically transparent polymer against master-molds that are patterned using photolithography. In Phase I we developed a new fabrication strategy that will allow us to provide devices that are more uniform and significantly reduce our scrap rate by eliminating cutting or punching of the polymer. This Phase II project will first focu on expanding this fabrication strategy to undertake large-scale manufacturing of our platform. Based on customer feedback we also identified unmet needs for preassembled devices, devices optimized for human stem cell-derived neurons, and devices amenable to the investigation of synapses. In this Phase II project we will further focus on these new devices using our feasibility data obtained during the Phase I funding period. The future commercialization of these devices will scientifically benefit the neuroscience research and testing community by enabling new experimental paradigms."
"9453194","PROJECT SUMMARY ! Sound transmission to the sensory cells of the inner ear is affected by a variety of passive macro-mechanical influences related to the outer ear, middle ear, and the surrounding bony structure of the inner ear. Abnormal macro-mechanics in otologic pathologies such as otosclerosis, ossicular discontinuity and superior canal dehiscence (SCD) can result in common debilitating auditory and vestibular symptoms such as hearing loss, blocked sensation of the ear, and vertigo induced by noise and pressure. The mechanisms by which many mechanical pathologies cause such symptoms are not well understood, and these pathologies are challenging to diagnose and treat. The purpose of this project is to improve our knowledge of the mechano-acoustic mechanisms in the normal and abnormal ear, enabling us to develop advanced diagnostic methods. In this proposal, we will focus on improving wideband acoustic immittance, a mechano-acoustic measurement taken at the ear canal that measures how much sound is reflected by the eardrum. WAI is a non-invasive, inexpensive approach with the potential to differentiate among middle ear and inner ear lesions that can present with similar symptoms. A non-invasive diagnostic method to detect various macro-mechanical pathologies would be an important development, preventing unnecessary surgery and improving patient outcomes. In Aim 1, we propose to use simple lumped element models and computational statistics to simulate and classify clinical WAI data from patients with otosclerosis, ossicular discontinuity and superior canal dehiscence (SCD), and explore the use of finite element modeling techniques to study the mechanisms of how specific pathologies contribute to changes in WAI. In Aim 2, we will evaluate the utility of WAI in monitoring short- and long-term postoperative mechanical changes after SCD surgery. We aim to help the millions of patients requiring solutions to common conductive pathologies through improvements in diagnosis prior to surgery and monitoring of mechanical changes postoperatively using non-invasive diagnostic methods. !"
"9427313","ABSTRACT: Therapeutic oligonucleotides (e.g., small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) and antisense) hold promise as transformative drugs for the treatment of genetically defined neurodegenerative disorders, including Huntington's disease (HD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). siRNAs silence disease-causing genes by targeting their cognate mRNAs for degradation, thereby preventing the expression of toxic gene products. Their inherent sequence specificity and prolonged activity provide a powerful therapeutic platform, as long as the disease is genetically defined and delivery to the relevant target tissue is achievable. However, siRNAs do not cross the blood?brain barrier and local CNS delivery by injection often results in poor retention, distribution or toxicity. Thus, efficient and non-toxic delivery represents a major hurdle in the development of RNAi-based drugs to treat neurodegenerative disorders.  The goal of this proposal is to develop and characterize novel chemical scaffolds that promote simple, efficient, and non-toxic delivery of oligonucleotides and potent silencing of therapeutic targets in the central nervous system. We describe a class of fully chemically stabilized hydrophobic siRNAs (hsiRNAs) that elicit durable and potent silencing throughout the brain following bolus cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) infusion. Modifications include oligonucleotides structure, ribose, backbone and the addition of lipophilic conjugates? e.g., neuroactive steroids, endocannabinoid-like lipids, gangliosides. Extensive structure-activity relationship studies reveal that the type of conjugate defines the distribution, retention, efficacy, duration of effect, and toxicity of hsiRNA-conjugates in the central nervous system.  Completion of this proposal will (i) define and characterize two novel chemical scaffolds that support potent, specific, and long-lasting silencing of target genes in the central nervous system, and (ii) validate this new platform in animal models of HD and ALS, establishing a path towards novel treatments for two neurodegenerative diseases. This proposal establishes a platform that allows direct targeting of any gene expressed in any region of the central nervous system in a rodent. Successful completion of this work will enable studies of gene function in the central nervous system and pave the way towards development of novel oligonucleotide-based therapies for genetically defined neurodegenerative diseases."
"9446054","A significant challenge faced by obligate aerobic eukaryotic pathogens during infection is low oxygen microenvironments. The ability to acquire sufficient oxygen in the face of oxygen depletion has now been shown to be critical for Aspergillus fumigatus and other eukaryotic pathogen's virulence. However, a major gap in knowledge is how obligate aerobic fungi acquire oxygen in the face of oxygen depletion. An in vitro experimental evolution experiment conducted under low oxygen conditions to identify mechanisms of A. fumigatus hypoxia fitness revealed an unexpected change in the fungal mycelium, or biofilm, morphology. A substantial increase in fungal colony furrowing, a so called rugose colony morphology, was observed in the evolved strain with a concomitant increase in hypoxia fitness compared to the parental strain. Importantly, this morphological change and increased hypoxia fitness strongly correlates with virulence. Examination of a large collection of A. fumigatus strains with increased virulence and hypoxia fitness reveals similar colony morphological changes. Preliminary whole genome sequencing of the evolved strain identified a mutation in a novel unstudied fungal specific gene we currently call eefA. Over-expression or loss of eefA dramatically affects fungal colony morphology, hypoxia fitness, and virulence. In this proposal, we will test the hypothesis that increased colony furrowing represents a novel mechanism for fungal oxygen acquisition that is critical for virulence. Using molecular genetics, biochemical, and host-pathogen interaction approaches, we will define the novel function of eefA in mediating fungal oxygen acquisition and virulence. Preliminary data strongly link eefA with the ability of hyphae to adhere and form furrows that promote oxygen access to fungal cells deep within the mycelium. How fungal colony morphology and structure affects A. fumigatus virulence is unstudied and represents a new paradigm for a mechanism of in vivo fitness in the face of low oxygen stress. Consequently, the proposed studies will reveal new insights into A. fumigatus virulence mechanisms and are expected to identify novel therapeutic approaches to thwart fungal oxygen acquisition in vivo to improve disease outcomes."
"9353302","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Many potentially effective e-health technologies fail to enjoy widespread adoption by older adults due to the dearth of accessible, user-friendly, delivery platforms. Multi-user health kiosks located in convenient community locations offer a way to bolster older adults' self-management capabilities and enhance communication with their PCPs, regardless of personal resources or distance from health services. This project entails investigation of older adults' perceptions of, motivations to use, and patterns of use of an adaptive, community-based, multi-user health kiosk. The overarching objective is to understand factors influencing older adults' use of the health kiosk as a measurement and intervention delivery system, relative to their identified needs for a healthier lifestyle and improved self-management of chronic disease. Kiosks capable of adaptive interaction with users will be deployed in nine congregate sites in southwestern Pennsylvania, enabling older adults to measure and track their own physical, physiological, and psychological data, communicate through secure messaging with primary care providers, and engage with e-health interventions designed to improve self-management, patient-provider communication, sleep, mobility and balance, physical activity and nutrition, bladder health, and mood. The specific aims of the project are to (1) describe the self-management needs, motivations, design preferences, and patterns of health kiosk use among diverse community-residing older adults in congregate settings; (2) determine factors that influence intensity of kiosk use among older adults with a range of needs for a healthier lifestyle and improved self-management of chronic disease; and (3) explore use of primary care, emergency room visits, and hospitalization during kiosk access. Over 18 months of study participation, older adults' interactions with the kiosk and the kiosk's adaptations to its users will be tracked. Frequent queries will explore motivations for using the kiosk and preferences for its interface design and content. Congruence will be evaluated between needs identified at baseline, 6, 12, and 18 months and use of kiosk measures and modules throughout the study. Assessment of self-management confidence and capability and healthcare use will also occur at 6, 12, and 18 months. Factors influencing differences in intensity of kiosk use and differences in the change in healthcare use based on levels of intensity will be examined. In-depth interviews will be conducted with a subsample of ten individuals per site (n=90) purposively selected to represent high and low intensity kiosk users and those with high and low levels of need."
"9450709","Many animal behaviors are organized into long-lasting states, perhaps most strikingly in the sleep/wake and emotional states that mammals display. However, the fundamental mechanisms that allow animals to initiate, maintain and terminate these states are unknown. Biogenic amine and neuropeptide neuromodulators are critical for the generation of behavioral states, but a mechanistic understanding of how neuromodulators act on circuits to generate stable circuit-wide patterns of neural activity has been lacking, largely due to the complexity of neuromodulation in mammalian circuits. We have chosen to tackle this problem using C. elegans, a nematode whose nervous system consists of 302 neurons with a fully defined wiring diagram. We previously characterized C. elegans movement patterns and showed that feeding animals transition between two stable arousal states, roaming and dwelling. We characterized the neural circuit that generates roaming and dwelling states, and found that two opposing neuromodulators, serotonin and the neuropeptide PDF, act on a defined neural circuit to generate this bi-stable behavior: serotonin action on the circuit stabilizes dwelling states, while PDF stabilizes roaming states. Now that we have defined a neuromodulatory circuit that generates persistent behavioral states, we are poised to resolve several fundamental questions about neural circuit function and organization. Here, we propose to dissect mechanisms of neural circuit persistence by examining how specific neuromodulators reconfigure neural circuits to stabilize circuit-wide activity patterns that give rise to long-lasting behavioral states. Resolving this question requires whole-circuit measurements of neural activity as animals freely transition between states. Thus, we have already developed a new imaging technology that allows us to simultaneously monitor the activity of every neuron in a circuit in freely-moving C. elegans animals. By combining this imaging technology with genetic/optogenetic manipulations and new analysis/modeling methods, we will illustrate a new multi-disciplinary approach that can be used to dissect the mechanisms by which collective neural dynamics arise in a circuit. First, we will first identify the circuit-wide patterns of activity that define different behavioral states (Aim 1). Second, we will perturb this system to examine how neuromodulators act on specific neurons in the circuit to generate these stable circuit-wide patterns of activity (Aim 2). Finally, we will determine how activity in this neuromodulatory circuit is altered by changes in the environment and, after simultaneously recording the sensory neurons that feed into this circuit, we will develop a network model that describes how noisy sensory inputs are transformed into a bi-stable behavioral state output (Aim 3). These studies will provide new mechanistic insights into how neuromodulators orchestrate whole-circuit changes in activity to influence behavior. By providing quantitative links between specific sites of neuromodulation, whole-circuit dynamics, and emergent behaviors, these studies will yield a generalizable model for circuit function that will bear on studies of sleep/wake states, emotional states, and cognitive states."
"9314898","Project Summary/Abstract Rapid changes in eye position are used to reorient the eyes towards points of interest. Illuminating the mechanisms underlying the initiation of these movements can provide insight into oculomotor disorders typically characterized by involuntary movements such as saccadic intrusions. These involuntary movements obscure vision by changing the focus of the retinal fovea. Detailed functional studies, primarily in non-human primates, have resulted in models that propose that rapid eye movements occur when the activity of single neurons or neuronal populations rises above a threshold. However, direct evidence for this model is absent. The goal of this proposal is to provide structural and functional analysis of a cell type we have recently discovered whose activity suggests a role in saccade initiation; these cells show a consistent rise in calcium multiple seconds before saccades. We uncovered a disruption in saccade rate following focal laser ablations of populations containing these neurons. To find these cells, we took advantage of the small size, genetic and optical accessibility of the larval zebrafish brain to image calcium activity from single cells throughout the majority of the hindbrain while simultaneously tracking spontaneous eye movements. The cells we found were the only hindbrain neurons containing pre-saccadic activity. Based on these results, we hypothesize that these cells contribute to the neural circuit initiating spontaneous saccades.  I propose two aims to elucidate role of pre-saccadic activity in triggering rapid eye movements. In the mentored K99 stage, I will characterize the activity of neurons with pre-saccadic activity during the fast phase of optokinetic stimulation and saccades using whole-brain calcium imaging and electrophysiology. I will refine the behavioral role of these neurons by reversibly silencing and activating their activity during stimulation (Aim 1; K99). Finally, I will assess how this neuron type interacts with other cell types in the oculomotor circuit and characterize the morphology of this cell class (Aim 2; R00). Collectively, these experiments will address unanswered questions in our understanding of how horizontal eye movements are generated. The training plan described in this proposal details a focused strategy for acquiring the necessary skills I need to successfully transition from a trainee to independent investigator. My principal mentor, Dr. Emre Aksay at Weill Cornell Medical College, and my exemplary team of co-mentors have been carefully chosen to provide the necessary experience and technical expertise to achieve this goal. Mentor counsel, recurring data presentations, attendance of seminars, conferences and professional courses will all be utilized to build the necessary communication and leadership skills vital to a successful scientific career. After transitioning to the independent phase, I will use these skills to establish a laboratory that uses interdisciplinary tools to study the neural basis of movement initiation."
"9464821","Project Summary/Abstract Disruptions in dopamine (DA) signaling are central to symptom presentation of several devastating neuropsychological disorders, such as schizophrenia, depression, Parkinson?s, and addiction, making normalization of DA signaling a primary concern in mental health(1-3). However, with the troubling side effects that can occur with direct dopaminergic manipulation(4; 3), and the identification of pathology within the circuits controlling DA neurons(6), the focus of much research has turned to the afferent regulation of the DA system. Through this effort, a critical pathway has been discovered from the ventral subiculum (Vsub) of the hippocampus to the ventral tegmental area (VTA), via the nucleus accumbens (NAc) and ventral pallidum (VP), that regulates population activity in the VTA(7). Population activity is important because only active DA neurons can fire in bursts(8), the behaviorally-salient output of the DA system(9-11), allowing the hippocampus to regulate the ?gain? of phasic DA release(8). A relatively unstudied regulator of hippocampal function is the medial septum (MS); a sub-region of the cholinergic basal forebrain, which, despite its known importance in psychiatric disorders, cognitive functions, and DA system interactions(13), has not been adequately evaluated in a pathway-specific manner. The MS innervates the hippocampus via primarily cholinergic and GABAergic projections(14), drives hippocampal theta rhythms(14), and affects goal-directed learning and memory(15; 16). Despite this, it has never been determined if the MS is an afferent regulator of the midbrain DA system. Additionally, no studies have drawn comparisons between Vsub-NAc-VP pathway regulation of VTA and substantia nigra (SNc), a region also implicated in psychopathology(3). Thus, it is critical to determine (1) whether the MS regulates DA activity in the VTA and SNc, (2) the mechanism and pathway by which this occurs, (3) whether this circuit is disrupted in a model of afferent-driven DA dysregulation, thereby highlighting the MS as relevant to treatment strategies, (4) the behavioral impact of this circuit, and (5) whether this circuit regulation is different in male and female rats. To test this, we will use in vivo electrophysiology to measure DA neuron firing in the VTA and SNc following MS activation with NMDA or DREADDs (hM3Dq). Pathway and neurotransmitter mechanism will be determined by inactivation of the Vsub or VP and by infusing specific antagonists into the VSub, respectively. The MAM model will be used to test this circuit in a model of afferent- driven DA dysregulation. The behavioral impact of this circuit will be tested by activating the MS with DREADDs (hM3Dq) and performing behaviors correlated to DA activity in the VTA (amphetamine-induced hyperlocomotion) and SNc (amphetamine-induced stereotypy) and a goal-direct, spatial memory task (T-maze reversal learning). These studies will lay the groundwork for the discovery of new treatment targets related to DA-driven symptoms and diseases by describing a novel regulator region of midbrain DA activity and by demonstrating differential neurotransmitter-based regional specificity in midbrain DA regulation."
"9453316","Project Summary  Traumatic brain injury (TBI) affects 1.7 million individuals in the US each year and when TBI is severe (sTBI), nearly all survivors experience cognitive dysfunction at 6 months. Trials aimed at lowering elevated intracranial pressure (ICP) through surgery or aggressive medical therapies have failed to show benefit in functional outcome, but the measurement of ICP as a marker for secondary brain injury remains a cornerstone of modern neurocritical care. We hypothesize that elevations in ICP impact cognition, a more biologically plausible result of elevations in ICP that contribute to brain ischemia, and that measurements of ICP-related cortical dysfunction can provide more precise targets of intervention to improve cognitive dysfunction in survivors of sTBI. Dr. Foreman will use data from a large, ongoing multicenter TBI study (Transforming Research and Clinical Knowledge, or TRACK-TBI; NIH/NINDS U01 NS086090) and an embedded multicenter EEG-based study (Spreading Depolarizations II: Development and Validation of Spreading Depolarization Monitoring for TBI Management, or SD II; DOD W81XWH-16-2-0020) to examine the effects of elevated ICP on domain-specific cognitive dysfunction (Aim 1). Dr. Foreman will then use intracranial and scalp electroencephalography (EEG) to stratify ICP based on the presence of ischemic EEG changes in cortical signaling (Aim 2). This research plan will leverage the clinical research infrastructure of TRACK-TBI, the physiologic data collection of SDII, and the expertise of National Science Foundation-funded engineering partners to analyze time-locked ICP and EEG signals, defining novel physiology with the potential to individualize ICP therapy to reduce the need for surgery or aggressive medical therapies, and to improve cognitive disability in survivors of sTBI.  This K23 award will establish Dr. Foreman as a clinician-scientist with expertise in 1) understanding time- series physiologic relationships in those with sTBI and 2) developing individualized physiologic targets for therapeutic intervention in order to improve clinically important outcomes, i.e. cognition after sTBI. This career development award will support Dr. Foreman?s short-term goals, including 1) a detailed understanding of cognitive outcome assessments and their application as primary endpoints in clinical and translational research; 2) acquisition of skills necessary to analyze and interpret EEG and other biological sensor data; 3) obtaining knowledge in statistical techniques necessary to link physiology with outcome. Dr. Foreman will meet these objectives under the guidance of a Mentorship Committee, including Dr. Daniel Woo (primary mentor), a federally-funded clinician-scientist and established faculty mentor; Dr. Opeolu Adeoye, an Emergency Physician and Neurointensivist with expertise in clinical research and trial design; and Dr. Jed Hartings, a neurophysiologist an international expert in intracranial EEG after sTBI. Dr. Foreman?s mentorship will also include Dr. Joel Kramer, a cognitive neuropsychologist and member of TRACK-TBI?s Outcomes Core and Dr. Jay Lee, a mechanical engineer and national leader in intelligent maintenance systems (IMS) research and algorithm development."
"9354432","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cancer is the second leading cause of death in the United States. Radiation therapy (RT), together with surgery and chemotherapy, is one of the most important modalities for cancer treatments. Patient safety is a paramount issue with radiation therapy. The safety concerns in radiation therapy have been recognized by many different national and international organizations including IAEA (International Atomic Energy Agency), ICRP (International Commission on Radiological Protection), NRC (Nuclear Regulatory Commission), WHO (World Health Organization), ASTRO (American Society for Radiation Oncology) and AAPM (American Association of Physicists in Medicine) in the past few decades. RT error was ranked as the #1 health technology hazard by ECRI (Emergency Care Research Institute). The field of radiation therapy as a whole has been attempting to improve patient safety over the past decades through the adoption of rigorous clinical workflows following the lessons learned from the previous incidents and following the guidelines published by the aforementioned organizations. However, as technologies become increasingly reliant on digital communication and workflows, the manual-auditing based safety measures continue to exhibit their limitations and antiquatedness. In this project, we propose to develop an automated health information technology (HIT) system to improve patient safety, treatment quality and working efficiency for radiation therapy. This system will continuously monitor errors and traces of inconsistencies in the patient data and documents in the clinical patient treatment systems, to make users aware of any patient safety issues. It is expected that the treatment quality will be improved by automatic performance of the standard-of-care quality checks and minimization of human errors in the clinical workflow. It is also expected that the working efficiency will be significantly improved due to the automatic safety and quality checks which when performed manually often account for approximately 50% of human worker workload. Over the past three years, we have been building such a HIT system and have demonstrated the clinical safety and quality significance and potential efficiency gains in our preliminary results. In this new project we plan to fundamentally overhaul our current efforts by making the computer-based safety and quality checks more accurate, responsive, user-friendly, powerful and fully automated. We also plan to integrate human factors into the design features, which were identified from the preliminary data, thereby maximizing the impacts of the system on safety and quality."
"9446207","PROJECT SUMMARY Patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) are a powerful model system for assessing drug efficacy of anti-cancer agents and understanding molecular mechanisms of drug resistance. However, results from individual research groups have been difficult to validate due to the lack of standardized PDX procedures, lack of scale for adequately powered PDX studies and the inability to efficiently share PDX specimens. A key contributor to this challenge is the lack of well-managed resources for community sharing and large-scale analysis of integrated, standardized datasets from PDX models. The JAX-Seven Bridges PDX Data Commons and Coordination Center (PDCCC) seeks to address this challenge and unite the efforts of the component data- generating (PDX Development and Trial Centers/PDTCs) and PDX model sharing (NCI?s Patient-Derived Model Repository/PDMR) parts of the PDX Development and Trials Centers Research Network (PDXNet) into a cohesive, trans-Network whole. Using innovative cloud computing and bioinformatic approaches, our PDCCC will provide administrative and computational infrastructure for PDXNet to enable PDX method standardization, model sharing, data sharing, and massive-scale data analysis. We will build a data storage, sharing, and analysis platform that harmonizes PDXNet data with other large datasets and analysis workflows available in the NCI Cancer Genomics Cloud. Simultaneously, we will administer planning meetings, training activities, and research pilots to build synergies within the PDXNet, enhancing the ability of the PDXNet to develop clinical trials from PDX studies. Our Specific Aims are to 1) establish a leadership and administration unit to manage and coordinate activities within PDXNet, including annual meetings, regular conference calls, training activities, trans-Network pilot projects, and outreach; 2) develop a cloud- integrated PDXnet Data Commons that integrates PDXNet data with the existing cloud-based data analysis platform - the Seven Bridges Cancer Genomics Cloud (SB-CGC); and 3) build analysis workflows and data sharing practices to optimize PDXNet research and enable PDXNet data to facilitate clinical trial design. To accomplish these Aims we have assembled a team with unique expertise in PDXs, cancer treatment, genomic analysis, data coordination, and project management from The Jackson Laboratory and Seven Bridges. Our combined institutional strengths include a history of leadership in (and commitment) to PDX, data resource, analytic and consensus standards development and application; practical expertise in PDX model sharing and collaborative community efforts; a broad array of statistical, bioinformatic, and software-related PDX resources; leadership expertise in large-scale, cloud-based biomedical data projects, notably the SB-CGC; and deep experience in high-performance database engineering and development. Our goal is to build an innovative, systematically organized PDCCC that will advance the efforts of PDXNet to improve the validity?and expand use?of the PDX system as a preclinical platform for precision oncology."
"9380294","Project Summary This prospective clinical cohort study will examine the association of HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) initiation and subsequent patterns of condom-use and sexually transmitted infections (STIs) in men who have sex with men (MSM). The cohort, comprising ~ 600 MSM, 18 years and older, who initiate PrEP and receive services from a sexual health clinic in San Francisco, will be followed quarterly for 12 months. PrEP, in the form of Truvada®, is a once daily pill, which is simple to use with low toxicity and good efficacy in reducing the risk of HIV acquisition. While PrEP addresses protection against HIV transmission, it does not provide any protection against other STIs, MSM are disproportionally affected by STIs, and rates continue to increase in this population8-10. This study will examine condom-use change and STIs in a high risk population of MSM taking PrEP. It will provide information on potential disease prevention strategies and health promotion messages that encompass social and individual influences on safe sex practices. In this study, the theories of Sexual Scripting and Reasoned Action will be used as a framework to guide the understanding of the social and individual influences on voluntary risk behavior and sexual practices among MSM. The aims of this study are: 1) To examine the associations between levels of risky behaviors in a cohort of MSM prior to initiating PrEP versus those behaviors over 12 months subsequent to initiating PrEP; 2) To identify changes in condom use and examine reasons for change; and 3) To determine changes in risk behaviors in MSM who are initiating PrEP using biological assays to measure the frequency and type of STIs. After frequencies and descriptive analyses are completed, multilevel logistic regression models will be used to predict the associations of risk behaviors before and after initiation of PrEP with demographic variables. Latent variable growth modeling (LGM) will be utilized to describe growth curves for condom use and STIs in order to understand not only the average change but also individual variations. Qualitative interviews will be conducted with a sample of 10-20 individuals to enrich our knowledge and understanding of the social influences and individual motivations that may be affecting condom-use. This study will capture sociodemographic data among PrEP users, their reasons for using PrEP, and the societal, psychological and behavioral influences on condom use and subsequent changes in STIs during a real-world implementation of a PrEP health program. Information gathered in this research will fill a knowledge gap on MSM using PrEP, condom-use and STIs. It will lay the foundational work for the development of a sexual health intervention for MSM on PrEP in order to improve condom use behavior and decrease STI rates. This study will be completed with the support and expertise from my interdisciplinary mentorship team. Drs. Portillo, Carrico, Boyer, Milo-Santos have a wide range of advanced knowledge in sexual health, MSM, risk behavior, statistical methods, qualitative and quantitative research and are committed to my successful training as a nurse researcher."
"9552319","ABSTRACT Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common and the most lethal brain cancer. Unfortunately, there has been tragically little therapeutic progress over the last 30 years. Surgery provides modest benefit, the blood-brain barrier (BBB) limits drug access, and GBM cells are resistant to radiation and to the leading chemotherapy, temozolomide. Targeted therapies for GBM have yielded disappointing results in trials to date. The challenges inherent in developing effective GBM therapeutic approaches have become increasingly clear, and include resistance to standard treatments, drug delivery into the tumor, a subpopulation of stem-like GBM cells (GSCs), and genetic complexity and molecular adaptability of GBM. GBM tumors display a cellular hierarchy of differentiation states, in which GSCs maintain a dynamic balance between the state of self-renewal and differentiation. A myriad of molecular signaling pathways crucial for the normal brain development also play important roles in glioma initiation and progression. We previously demonstrated that MET receptor tyrosine kinase signaling is a crucial regulator of GSCs. Recent studies have implicated that various neurotransmitter signaling can promote tumor growth and progression via maintaining stem cell state. Our recent studies and preliminary data have discovered that dopamine receptor subtype 2 (DRD2), a key receptor of dopamine signaling, promoted GBM growth via regulating the stem cell state of GSCs. Unexpectedly, DRD2 was highly expressed in clinical GBM specimens, with preferential expression in GSCs, compared to normal brain tissue. Mechanistically, DRD2 facilitated proliferation and clonogenic growth of GBM cells via activation of MET. This finding is highly relevant because MET signaling is frequently hyperactive in GBMs as a key regulator of cancer stem phenotype and GBM radio-resistance, and it is a well-recognized therapeutic target in GBM. Importantly, DRD2 knockdown or an FDA-approved DRD2 antagonist-mediated DRD2 inhibition potently inactivated oncogenic signaling pathways, diminished clonogenic growth of GSCs, and impeded GBM growth in orthotopic xenograft models. Furthermore, we found a strong synergistic anti- tumor effect by combination of MET inhibitor and DRD2 antagonist in a subset of GBM. This project will interrogate the roles of MET-DRD2 signaling in GSC self-renewal and GBM progression, and elucidate the mechanisms of oncogenic DRD2 signaling at the molecular level (Aim 1), and test therapeutic efficacy of FDA- approved antipsychotic drugs and novel inhibitory peptides that can specifically block the interaction between DRD2 and MET (Aim 2), and determine therapeutic efficacies of these targeting reagents alone or in combination with standard therapies in preclinical patient GBM-derived orthotopic tumor models and identify the biomarkers that predict therapeutic response (Aim 3). We anticipate that completion of these proposed studies will yield a new paradigm for cancer stem cell biology and provide a novel and effective therapeutic approach, which may lead to the translation into improved therapies."
"9390408","DESCRIPTION :      Mentoring and Training Activities  The proposed CDA-2 is designed to promote Dr. Hall's transition to an independent Rehabilitation Research career under the mentorship of leading researchers in the areas of physical function, PTSD, and chronic disease management. The training plan for this CDA-2 includes a mix of didactic and experiential learning activities. The primary objectives of this training plan include: develop competency in cognitive- behavioral approaches to reducing PTSD symptoms; develop hands-on experience and utilize innovative mobile health technologies; develop expertise in physical activity interventions for Veterans with PTSD and the development of comparative effectiveness clinical trials; and continued professional development in the areas of manuscript preparation, grant proposals, and the responsible conduct of research.  There is substantial evidence that physical inactivity contributes to poorer physical health outcomes in older adults. There is a paucity of work examining physical activity in Veterans with PTSD. Consequently, the efficacy of exercise as a beneficial adjunctive therapy in the treatment for PTSD symptoms and related health sequelae has not been established. Methods: Eighty Veterans 60 years and older with PTSD will be recruited from the Durham VAMC PTSD clinic to participate in a 12-week physical activity program consisting of aerobic and strength-training activities. Participants will be randomized to an intervention arm or usual care. Outcomes: Changes in physical function, PTSD symptom severity, and aerobic endurance will be assessed between the two study arms. Secondary outcomes include compliance with the intervention, pain, sleep, and psychological well-being. Summary: This pilot trial will extend our understanding of the physical and psychological benefits of physical activity in Veterans with PTSD. The results from this study will be used to be  used to develop a larger, randomized controlled exercise trial for Veterans with PTSD. Once new, effective exercise therapies for Veterans with PTSD are established, we can augment traditional PTSD therapy with exercise therapy to promote the prevention and treatment of chronic diseases common in this vulnerable population."
"9567640","The ciliopathies are a group of >100 overlapping clinical disorders caused by defects in the primary cilium and its anchoring structure, the basal body. Although individually rare, this group contributes significantly to the population genetic disease burden, with some estimates placing their combined incidence to as much as 1:1000. Importantly, although some ciliopathies are lethal, most patients survive to adulthood, where they are faced with profound clinical challenges of managing multiple symptoms that include retinal degeneration, neurocognitive defects, obesity, diabetes and psychiatric illness. At present, there are no treatments and minimal palliative options. This proposal aims to take the first steps towards developing clinical assets that aspire to slow or arrest degenerative aspects of the ciliopathy pathology. Our work is grounded on two key observations. First, several recent studies have shown that ciliopathy proteins regulate the selective proteasome-mediated degradation of signaling components. Second, a recent genome-wide suppressor screen in human cells showed that suppression of the deubiquitinase USP35 could ameliorate ciliopathy-induced signaling defects. Validating these observations, suppression or deletion of USP35 in three zebrafish models of Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS), a model ciliopathy, attenuated several pathognomonic phenotypes, most prominently structural and trafficking defects in the photoreceptor with no apparent toxic side effects. These discoveries and models have been foundational to the formation of Rescindo Therapeutics, a biotech company whose mission is to develop suppressor screens and derivative molecules as rational therapeutic agents. During the past year, Rescindo has developed two reagents of potential clinical utility: an adeno-associated virus expressing shRNAs against human and mouse USP35 and antisense oligonucleotides against the same target. Here, we aim to test the utility of these tools in human cells and in mouse models as a pre-amble to designing clinical trials. Within our company, we will test the efficacy of each reagent to attenuate paracrine signaling in primary cells derived from patients with mutations in three different BBS genes. In parallel, and in collaboration with the Arshavsky laboratory at Duke, we will test whether each reagent can have a quantitative benefit in attenuating or extinguishing the progressive loss of photoreceptors in a mouse mode of BBS. Successful completion of these studies will provide the necessary data for the rational design of future trials and will represent a key step towards developing the first therapeutic assets for ciliopathies."
"9387102","This application is a response to PAR #16-355 ?Social Epigenomics Research Focused on Minority Health and Health Disparities.? In the contemporary United States, children's outcomes vary substantially by their family's socioeconomic status (SES). These disparities are present in multiple domains, including cognitive development, psychiatric disorders, and physical health. As low-SES youth mature into adulthood, they continue to have disproportionately poor outcomes, as reflected in poverty rates, mental health problems, and morbidity and mortality from chronic diseases associated with aging. Social science has identified a variety of structural, contextual, and psychological factors that contribute to these disparities. But we have only a superficial understanding of how these factors ?get under the skin? to influence biological processes that are proximally involved in brain maturation, health problems, and other outcomes that pattern by SES. Recently, theorists have addressed this question by posting that socioeconomic disadvantage gets biologically embedded during gestation, a sensitive period when multiple organ systems are developing. Animal models show that gestational influences of this sort are possible, and mediated in significant part through modulation of epigenetic and transcriptional processes in the placenta. Nevertheless, studies have yet to comprehensively examine the plausibility of the embedding hypothesis in human subjects. We seek to fill this gap here by recruiting an economically diverse sample of 700 women during pregnancy, and characterizing multiple dimensions of their lifecourse socioeconomic conditions. At delivery, we will biopsy women's placentas, and measure gene regulation in a biologically integrated fashion by assaying patterns of DNA methylation (DNAm), and expression of microRNA (miRNA) and messenger RNA (mRNA). We hypothesize that to the extent that women are lower in SES, their placental biopsies will show epigenetic and transcriptional patterns indicative of lower fetal tolerance, greater immune activation, and slower organ maturation. Using data from geocoding, interviews, and questionnaires, we also will develop a multilevel framework. It will specify connections between features of neighborhoods (economic deprivation, violent crime, residential segregation, social capital), families (job instability, financial duress, relationship qualities), and individuals (depressive symptoms, pregnancy anxiety, lifestyle factors), and characterize the strength and nature of their associations with dimensions of placental gene regulation, i.e., DNAm, miRNA, and mRNA. Finally, we will clarify the clinical implications of these patterns by examining their connections to preterm birth and growth restriction. We hypothesize that lower SES women will experience higher incidences of both conditions relative to higher SES women. Using mediation analyses, we will attempt to identify molecular pathways that contribute to these disparities, with an emphasis on chronic inflammatory lesions in the placenta, and epigenetic and transcriptional modifications that initiate and/or maintain them."
"9352781","ABSTRACT  Cigarette smoking is the leading cause of death accounting for more than 480,000 deaths each year, and 16 million Americans suffer from one or more diseases caused by smoking. Cessation of tobacco use can significantly reduce the risk of disease. Telephone quitlines are an effective and highly scalable way to help individuals quit smoking. However quitlines are an underutilized resource, and do not reach certain segments of the population, including males and racial/ethnic minorities. Guided imagery is a form of mind-body therapy that involves controlled visualization of specific mental images, and shares similarities with mindfulness meditation. Multiple studies have shown that exposure to mindfulness and imagery training results in significantly increased smoking abstinence rates. Also, imagery is used by a significant number of racially diverse male and female athletes. Although imagery is an effective tool for smoking  cessation, the mode of delivery has generally been in person, limiting the dissemination to large populations. We hypothesize that guided mental imagery delivered using the uitline ?coaching model? combined with an interactive website could be an effective and disseminable intervention strategy. In addition, this model may be more readily accepted by underrepresented smokers, and may increase the reach and effectiveness of telephone quitlines. Therefore, the objective of this three year R34 application is to develop and test the feasibility of a theory-driven, telephone plus web-based, guided mental imagery intervention for smoking cessation. We will develop the intervention and attention-control condition, study procedures, training protocols, and competency testing models with input from quitline personnel, and focus and user groups of smokers in preparation for a randomized clinical trial. We will conduct a feasibility trial (N=100) to gather preliminary data on recruitment, retention, and preliminary estimates of the potential effects of the guided mental imagery intervention on quitline callers? tobacco use, cravings, and self-efficacy to quit smoking. Participants will be randomly assigned to receive either the Imagery Intervention or a matched control condition delivered by project imagery coaches. Participants will be assessed at baseline, 6-weeks and 6-months post-enrollment. Primary outcomes will be self-reported point prevalence and prolonged abstinence of tobacco use. A subsample of 20 quitters will be tested for salivary cotinine as biochemical validation of self-report in this population.  Secondary outcomes will be self-reported cravings and self-efficacy. A manual of procedures will be developed to prepare us to conduct a future randomized controlled trial to determine the efficacy of the imagery intervention. The proposed project has the potential to advance the science of tobacco cessation through the addition of guided mental imagery, and improve public health through increased reach of telephone quitlines. It is innovative in that it uses guided imagery to address theory-driven targets of self-efficacy for abstinence and cravings. If successful, this model could be expanded to address other health behaviors such as diet, physical activity and other substance use."
"9472711","The long-term goal of our research is to develop a rational basis for neuroprotective strategies in order to prevent the onset and to slow the progression of Huntington's disease (HD). Increasing evidence suggests that mutant huntingtin (mHtt) and structural and functional abnormalities of mitochondria are involved in neuronal damage and neuronal loss in HD. Several lines of evidence support the involvement of mitochondrial abnormalities in HD progression and pathogenesis: 1) Increased expression levels of the mitochondrial fission genes Drp1 and Fis1 have been found in postmortem tissues from affected brain regions in HD patients and in striatal and cortical tissues from BACHD transgenic mice; 2) Decreased expression levels of the mitochondrial fusion genes Mfn1, Mfn2, and Opa1 have been found in these same affected regions from HD patients and BACHD transgenic mice; 3) Drp1 interacts with mHtt, and this interaction increases as HD progresses; 4) Increased levels of GTPase Drp1 enzymatic activity have been found in HD neurons; and 5) Decreased mitochondrial mass and motility, reduced anterograde axonal transport of mitochondria, and reduced synaptic viability have been found in primary neurons from BACHD transgenic mice. A therapeutic strategy for HD may involve inhibiting excessive mitochondrial fragmentation. Several mitochondrial fission inhibitors have been identified, including the mitochondria division inhibitor Mdivi1. Mdivi1 has been studied using ischemia/reperfusion injury models, renal injury, and oxygen-glucose deprivation. Findings have revealed that Mdivi1 reduces mitochondrial fission and increases mitochondrial fusion, and maintains mitochondrial function and cell survival. In studies of mitochondrial dynamics in an HD-stable striatal cell line that carries 111 polyQ repeats, researchers found reduced levels of fission genes and increased levels of fusion genes in HDQ111 cells treated with Mdivi1. Mdivi1-treated HDQ111 cells also showed increased mitochondrial function and synaptic activity, suggesting that Mdivi1 protects mitochondrial structure and function, and enhances cell survival. The current application seeks to determine whether a partial reduction of Drp1 in neurons from BACHD transgenic mice and HD knockin mice decreases mitochondrial fission and decreases mHtt-induced toxicity; and whether Mdivi1 in neurons from BACHD transgenic mice and HD knockin mice reduces excessive mitochondrial fragmentation and enhances mitochondrial function and synaptic activity. The outcome of this research will be an elucidation of genetic and pharmacological strategies that may reduce excessive mitochondrial fragmentation and increase neuronal survival and synaptic functions in HD-affected neurons."
"9348597","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Unintentional poisoning is the second leading cause of injury death in the United States. Collaboration between poison control centers (PCCs) and emergency departments (EDs) is dependent upon verbal, telephone communication that can lead to miscommunication, data loss, and error. (3, 4). Recent research has identified numerous vulnerabilities and inefficiencies in the current telephone-based system of collaboration, vulnerabilities that must be addressed in order to ensure patient safety. Health information exchange (HIE), the electronic exchange of patient information, could better support PCC-ED collaboration for poisoned patients during routine operations and in disaster scenarios, when telephone-based communication is fragile. However, we currently lack both process models and informatics tools (standards and software) for PCC-ED health information exchange and this poses a substantial barrier to HIE for U.S. poison control centers operating with limited resources. Moreover, there is no available information on the clinical effects of implementing this type of provider-to-provider health information exchange, including effects on workflow and patient care. The specific aims of this study are as follows: (1) Develop a model process for HIE supported ED- PCC collaboration, (2) Develop and implement informatics tools for HIE supported ED-PCC collaboration, and (3) Evaluate the effects of the model HIE process and informatics tools on workflow, communication, efficiency, and utilization. We will develop a replicable, scalable process for ED-PCC health information exchange and develop informatics tools that enable emergency departments and poison control centers to engage in HIE. We will also evaluate the effect of the prototype information exchange process on workflow and clinical outcomes including emergency department door-to-decision time, time to PCC case closure, and change in the number of telephone calls exchanged between EDs and PCCs. These innovations reflect patient-focused information management and are designed to ensure availability of poisoning-related information to support transitions and collaborations in care. !"

"9461166","Summary The 2018 meeting will be the third GRC on ?Sleep Regulation and Function?, the second Sleep GRC to include a GRS, and the first conference after we were promoted from a GRC-sponsored meeting to a continuing GRC. As in 2014 and 2016, the 2018 GRC/GRS will be held at the GRC site in Galveston TX. There are many large meetings for sleep professionals, but sleep GRC/GRS clearly meet a widely-felt need: they are the only existing small-format conference focused broadly on the latest basic sleep research, with the specific goal of fostering forward-thinking and innovative approach to sleep science. Both previous sleep GRCs scored in the highest-performing group among all GRCs held in their respective year, with >85% of respondents ranking the meetings as ?excellent? in all categories. Participation was outstanding (199 applications accepted for 2014, 233 for 2016), with 22% (2014) and 25% (2016) of attendees coming from Europe and Asia. Sleep GRCs contributed significantly to grow the next generation of sleep researchers: trainees were 30% of all attendees in 2014 and 40% in 2016. Sleep GRCs also strongly promoted diversity: women represented 44% (2014) and 49% (2016) of all attendees. We believe this success will continue in 2018. The Chair (Dr. Chiara Cirelli, U Wisconsin ? Madison), Vice-Chair (Dr. Paul Shaw, Washington U - St. Louis), and the Steering Committee of 12 eminent sleep researchers planned an outstanding program that spans the breath of the field and reaches out to outside experts, including the Keynote Speaker, Dr. Cristina Alberini (NYU) and Drs Matthew Colonnese (George Washington U) and Heiko Luhmann (U Mainz Germany). None of them has studied sleep per se, but their work on memory consolidation and on the maturation of brain activity soon after birth, when sleep is the predominant behavior, is highly relevant for many of us. The other 7 sessions will discuss the evolving roles of catecholamines in sleep/wake regulation, the cellular and systems? costs of wake for brain and body, the new paradoxes of REM sleep, the global and local determinants of sleep need, the consequences of enhancing/disrupting specific sleep rhythms, the metabolic and vascular effects of sleep disruption. These topics were specifically chosen because thought-provoking and, in line with the subtitle for the 2018 meeting, they are expected to trigger an intense debate on the ?How and Why? of sleep, with the goal of leading to new insights. In addition to including a GRS, the 2018 GRC program will strongly promote the training of young sleep researchers by including 8 early career scientists as GRC speakers or discussion leaders, and 7 trainees (graduate students and post-docs) as GRC speakers. Both Chair and Keynote speaker are women, and so are 38% of the speakers and 78% of the Discussion leaders (~33% for both in 2016). Sleep research is thriving, unraveling the specific mechanisms by which sleep benefits brain and body, from learning and memory to metabolic and cardiovascular function. We expect this meeting to be a crucial milestone that helps the field to move forward in an open-minded and innovative manner."
"9222501","The Center for Functional Electrical Stimulation (FES Center) is a 25 year consortium that develops and deploys rehabilitation treatments based on functional electrical stimulation (FES) for Veterans and civilians with neurological, autonomic, psychiatric, pain, and other disorders. The VISION of the Cleveland FES Center is broad - to perform cutting edge research and creative engineering, and to then transition these discoveries and technologies into the clinical environment to create effective, clinically-available options for patients and the people who care for them. The MISSION of the FES Center, however, is very clear and tightly focused - to develop interventions based on the electrical stimulation of the nervous system to replace or compensate for natural neural function lost due to neurological disease or injury. The scope of FES Center research has evolved and expanded significantly during the current five year funding cycle to reflect new scientific discoveries and new clinical opportunities. This proposal represents this evolution and thus describes the five research thrusts of the FES Center for the next five years: (1) MOVEMENT RESTORATION: restoring limb, respiratory, and other body movements; (2) BRAIN HEALTH: brain stimulation interventions for movement disorders (e.g., Parkinson's disease), stroke and traumatic brain injuries, epilepsy, and neuropsychiatric disorders, as well as brain recording technologies; (3) PAIN: pain mitigation through stimulation of peripheral nerves and the spinal cord; (4) AUTONOMIC SYSTEMS: autonomic nervous system stimulation for restoration and/or regulation of internal body and visceral functions; and (5) TECHNOLOGY AND TOOLS: development of basic stimulation techniques, implantable systems and electrodes, modeling and simulation tools, and other rehabilitation approaches complementary to FES. These seemingly diverse research thrusts in fact share a deep foundation of basic knowledge, use similar and often identical technologies, and rely on a proven model of genuine clinical-technical partnerships. The FES Center has built a critical mass of investigators in each of these research thrust areas, and will continue to pursue research in important new clinical areas where FES may provide effective treatments. FES Center research thrusts are tightly aligned with the priorities of the VA RR&D Service, and FES Center investigators are leaders in the national and local rehabilitation communities.  The FES Center operates with core funding from the VA Rehabilitation Research and Development Service and uses these resources to broadly enable the success of its investigators by providing a unique technical infrastructure, specialized research services (regulatory, statistical, medical illustration, inter-institutional administrative support), development of key industrial and academic relationships, and communication to potential patients, other scientists, and to the general public. The consortium structure of the FES Center continues to effectively leverage the amazingly rich academic and clinical expertise across the Cleveland area. The FES Center focus on community building, collaboration and inclusion, and shared infrastructure ? rather than on funding specific projects ? has promoted continuous innovation and growth, enabled MANY investigators to successfully pursue major projects that would otherwise be impractical, and has realized economic efficiencies through core facilities and economies of scale. AND, the FES Center has steered this major enterprise to focus on the rehabilitation challenges of Veterans!  The FES Center and its investigators have been highly successful over the past five years in terms of research productivity and collaboration, clinical impact, leadership in rehabilitation research, and training and career development of VA investigators. We have developed ambitious but obtainable goals for the coming 5 years, as well as a clear plan for achieving these goals. The FES Center will continue to provide core resources that can be leveraged by our investigators and their interdisciplinary teams to conduct unique, cutting-edge research and clinical deployment. The scope of FES Center research has been expanded over the past five years, but our overriding objective - to achieve increasingly meaningful impact on the lives of Veterans and civilians with disabilities - remains unchanged. The FES Center is thus poised to have continued impact on rehabilitation research into the future."
"9383471","Project Summary/Abstract  Caveolin-1 (Cav-1), the signature protein of caveolae membrane domains, is linked to several ocular/retinal diseases including primary open angle glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy, and autoimmune uveitis. We have found that Cav-1 and caveolae play important roles in blood-retinal barrier (BRB) integrity, ion homeostasis, and retinal function. More recently, we have found that Cav-1 promotes the activation of Toll-like Receptor-4 (TLR4) propagating TLR4-induced cytokine production and inflammatory BRB breakdown. As Cav-1 is upregulated in several retinal inflammatory conditions, our results imply that local disruption of Cav-1 function presents a viable therapy to suppress retinal inflammatory insults. Given that current steroid-based therapies for retinal inflammatory disease are not completely effective and fraught with potentially severe side effects, we hypothesize that Cav-1 and caveolae domains represent novel therapeutic targets to suppress retinal inflammation resulting from pathogens as well as from endogenous damage that occurs during retinal degenerative diseases. However, as Cav-1 plays several important roles in retinal homeostasis and cardiovascular function, we must carefully evaluate the cell and tissue-intrinsic roles of this protein to determine the potential of suppressing Cav-1 function locally in the retina, it is imperative to understand the mechanisms for these complex cell-intrinsic properties. In this proposal we will use cell-specific Cav-1 knockout mice to test cell-intrinsic Cav-1 functions in the hope of validating Cav-1 as a new therapeutic target for retinal inflammation, BRB breakdown, and neurodegeneration induced by inflammation. We will test a novel mechanism whereby Cav-1 modulates the stability of TNF Receptor Associated Factor 3 (TRAF3) a downstream signaling component of innate immune receptors such as TLR4. TRAF3 is abundantly expressed in the retina but has yet to be rigorously studied as a local regulator of immune signaling. The goals of this proposal are to determine the mechanism(s) by which Cav-1 modulates retinal inflammatory signaling, BRB breakdown, and neurodegeneration induced by both pathogen- and damage-derived immune activation. We will also examine the mechanism by which Cav-1 controls retinal TRAF3 levels. These goals have clear"
"9571064","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Engineering vascularized bone tissue for scaffolding repairing remains a significant clinical problem. One major challenge is to develop systematic models based on coordinated experiments. The second challenge is to understand the underlying mechanisms of the synergistic effects of the temporal combinations of growth factor cues. The third challenge in bone tissue engineering is the establishment of a well functional vascular network. In order to address these challenges, we plan to take advantage of our expertise in biomaterials, cell biology and computational modeling to develop coherent experimental protocols, material engineering and multi-scale mathematical models for systematically optimizing bone regeneration (called sBone system). This bone repairing process is likely under the control of many complex pathways. Using the classical BMP-2/IGF-1 dual-growth-factor temporal combination system as the biological model, our systems biology research, led to the hypothesis that BMP-2 induces Smad1/2 signaling pathways of MSCs, gradually remodels the expression pattern of Runx2 and Osx pathways, and thus sensitizes MSCs to the late IGF-1 cue. We will first develop in-vitro multi-temporal scale model for optimal temporal combinations of growth factors to promote bone regeneration, and conduct in-silico screening using the model and in-vitro validation of candidate growth factor combinations. Second, we will develop a predictive multi-scale model of bone regeneration within the novel pre-vascularized macro-porous, biodegradable beta-tricalcium phosphate (?-TCP) based scaffolds loaded with the programmed growth factor release system. And finally we will guide the design of the chemo-physical features of bone scaffolds by in-silico optimization of growth factor release profiles and the geometric parameters of the macro-pores. Through integration of in silico and experimental analyses, we will be able to use systems biology approaches to optimize the temporal combinations of growth factor release from the engineering vessel grafted 3D scaffolds for successful in-vivo bone regeneration."
"9321807","There is growing interest in the effects of meditation practices on health. Meditation targets the practitioner's  brain/mind, with subsequent positive effects on bodily functions. However, there is great need for rigorous  studies that establish if meditation does indeed produce long-lasting changes in the brain, what these  changes may be, and their functional significance for healthy subjects in daily life as well as in clinical  populations. Project 1 of the Center Proposal aims at demonstrating effects of meditation training on  behavior as well as on neurobiological markers related to emotion and emotion regulation. Project 2 will  evaluate the effects of meditation training on inflammatory markers and its potential benefits in a clinical  population with asthma, a typical inflammatory disease. This project (Project 3) aims at establishing the  functional significance of our previous observation of meditation-induced changes in  electroencephalographic (EEG) activity during sleep for brain activity and cognitive functioning during  wakefulness. In the previous NCCAM project we found that long term meditators had an increase in EEG  gamma activity during non rapid eye movement sleep as compared to meditation naive individuals. This  increase was specific for the gamma range, and correlated with the length of meditation practice. We will  evaluate if this increased gamma activity during sleep in long term meditators is associated with changes in  sleep mentation (a change in the occurrence and cognitive aspects of dream reports). We will also evaluate  if meditation-induced changes in brain activity during sleep are associated with changes in brain activity and  cognitive function during wakefulness. We will then assess whether the differences in brain activity patterns  and cognitive function observed in long term meditators can be induced in meditation naive individuals after  intense 8 week meditation training, enhanced by post-training meditation boosters. Finally, we will assess  the general significance of our findings for health, by correlating meditation-induced brain activity changes  with inflammatory markers in a population of asthmatic patients."
"9350838","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT: Influenza, ebola, dengue and zika are only a few of the viruses which caused past or ongoing pandemics and threaten recurrence. All of these viruses package their infectious genomes in a cell-derived membrane envelope decorated with viral proteins that mediate infectious cell entry. Due to pressures for mechanistic economy imposed by their small size, viruses often combine in a single protein different interdependent functions. Yet they retain extreme adaptability ? they evolve rapidly under changing conditions. Viral cell-entry proteins combine distinct protein domains with membrane fusion and target cell attachment functions. Membrane fusion delivers viral genomes to the cell interior by merging the viral envelope with a cell membrane. The attachment domains bring viruses to the fusion target. They also serve to stabilize fusion domains in the extracellular environment, which retards fusion within endosomes (sites of fusion inside cells) ? they act as fusion repressors. Thus productive cell entry requires a delicate balance of protein's stability and functional plasticity. One source of changing external pressures on cell entry are neutralizing antibodies produced by the immune system. Another source are mechanistic pressures of zoonotic adaptations, when entry proteins adjust preference from animal to human receptors, and alter fusion protein stability as required for human-to-human transmission. How is the extreme adaptability achieved by a system that is constrained both by the changing environment and mechanistic economy? In my past work, I achieved unprecedented, molecular-level resolution of influenza membrane fusion by combining 1) single-virion real-time imaging of membrane fusion of authentic virions with planar membrane bilayers, 2) computational and theoretical modeling of time-delay distributions to various fusion intermediates, and 3) structure-based mutagenesis. This work offered the first glimpse into how adaptability of membrane fusion might be achieved through combined action among multiple fusion proteins on a virus. Hundreds of fusion proteins on a single influenza virus particle contact the target membrane, but only several neighboring ones mediate fusion. I have identified independent avenues available to influenza to fine-tune fusion, two of which affect either the available pool of active fusion proteins on the virion surface or the required number of fusion-protein neighbors. In this proposal, I seek to 1) determine the molecular mechanisms allowing adaptation of the interdependent cell-entry functions of influenza, and 2) define the constraints limiting evolvability of the influenza virus cell-entry functions. I will build upon my combined approaches to enable a holistic molecular picture of membrane fusion and membrane attachment/fusion-repression functions of intact HAs on authentic virions and in near native conditions of purified endosomes. By defining evolutionary rules, entry-protein functional changes, and their co-dependence, we might improve our predictive ability for viral strains with high pandemic potential. Fundamental principles deduced for influenza are likely to extend to other viral cell-entry systems.  "
"9389194","Project Summary/Abstract Understanding environmental health disparities for older persons is critical given the unprecedented aging of the population, with 20% of US persons anticipated to be >65y by 2030, and the elder population becoming more racially and ethnically diverse. Older persons can be more affected by environmental and socio- economic status (SES) factors due to baseline health, changing metabolism, or larger cumulative exposures. Harmful environmental exposures, such as air pollution, often occur in communities facing SES stressors including deteriorating housing, poor access to health care, high unemployment, crime, and poverty, which may exacerbate negative health effects. This phenomenon is most pronounced for low income and minority communities and underlies health disparities. Identifying the most harmful environmental and social factors and the subpopulations of elderly that are most affected is of paramount importance. Although it is widely agreed that multiple environmental and SES factors affect health, little is known about their complex interactions. Our long-term objective is to investigate how environmental and SES factors jointly contribute to health disparities in the older population. We consider disparities in two separate but related forms: 1) differences in exposures (e.g., pollution levels) to environmental and SES factors; and 2) differences in health response (e.g., relative risk) from exposures to environmental and SES factors. This proposal brings together investigators with a long history of working on environmental health disparities and related advanced spatial and statistical analyses. Our aims are to: 1) calculate differences in exposures to environmental and SES factors, considered individually and collectively, for an older population (>65y) in Michigan and North Carolina, and to construct a highly resolved spatio-temporal data architecture for analysis; 2) calculate differences by subpopulation (e.g., race/ethnicity, age, sex, community SES) for associations between environmental and SES factors and cause- specific emergency cardiovascular and respiratory hospital admissions, emergency department visits, and mortality; and 3) combine disparities in exposures and disparities in health response to calculate overall environmental health disparities. Environmental and some SES factors represent modifiable risks through which we can improve health in our aging population. Analyses will identify the most effective foci for intervention and policy engagement by identifying the most significant common contributors to environmental health disparities for the elderly, thereby directly contributing to NIEHS's mission to discover how the environment affects people in order to promote healthier lives."
"9407320","ABSTRACT This project will test human embryonic stem cell-derived 3-D retinal tissue transplanted in subretinal space of 2 animal models with photoreceptor (PR) degeneration in a longitudinal study lasting for up to 12 months. We will use a large-eye animal model of early-onset RD with a Crx mutation (Rdy Abyssinian cats) and immunodeficient rats with PR degeneration SD-Foxn1 Tg(S334ter)3Lav (RD nude). The immediate goal is to demonstrate survival, lamination, maturation, and structural and synaptic integration of grafts with the recipient retina, the and improvement in vision by 6-12 months, and to generate standard operating procedures for transforming such technology into therapy to treat blindness caused by PR death. The overarching goal is to evaluate this technology in pilot clinical trials in patients with retinitis pigmentosa (RP), an orphan disease with fast track FDA approval . Blindness is a major health concern among Americans, affecting quality of life and with a high financial and heavy emotional burden. The two major retinal diseases associated with photoreceptor degeneration are RP and dry age-related macular degeneration (AMD). There is a critical and urgent need to find new treatments of RP and AMD based on photoreceptor replacement. The research in the past 15-20 years indicates that a piece of degenerating mammalian retina can be replaced with healthy fetal retinal tissue, which can improve vision. The research shows that grafted fetal retina will complete differentiation, synapse on the recipient retinal ganglion cell neurons, and re-establish connectivity with the visual cortex. Human fetal-derived retinal tissue supply is very limited, and its clinical use in therapy is ethically not acceptable. BioTime hypothesizes that 6-8- week old human embryonic stem cell-derived 3-D retinal tissue will integrate structurally and synaptically into the degenerating recipient retina and improve vision in animals with advanced RD . We predict that demonstrating positive therapeutic impact of hESC-3D retinal tissue grafting in a ?large eye? animal model with RD will enable us to move this technology to pilot clinical trials in RP patients. We have already developed hESC-3D retinal tissue and demonstrated that it carries a layer of RPE, PRs , second order neurons and ganglion cells, is capable We also reported that it improves vision in a rat animal model with RP and blindness and activates superior colliculus . We propose to do in vivo testing in a ?large eye? animal model of RD (Rdy cats) with blindness, and in a large cohort of SD-Foxn1 Tg(S334ter)3Lav (RD nude) rats with RD to statistically evaluate the feasibility of this therapy in RP patients. In Aim 1 (BioTime), we will scale-up production of hESC-3D retinal tissue from cGMP-grade hESCs and evaluate several lots using FDA criteria. In Aim 2 (UCI), we will do subretinal grafting into blind rats and evaluate vision improvements and graft-host connectivity. In Aim 3 (MSU), we will do subretinal grafting into Rdy/+ cats and also evaluate vision improvements and graft-host connectivity. The results and procedures will be integrated into clinical protocols to enable clinical trials of blindness caused by PR degeneration of axonogenesis, synaptogenesis and becomes progressively electrically active. ."
"9371390","Candidate:  I  am currently  a  vitreoretinal fellow  with  the  long-term  career  goal of   becoming  an  independent clinician-scientist and a recognized leader in the field of retinal neurovascular development and  pediatric retinal imaging. My research agenda is focused on investigating retinal neuronal and  vascular development and disease using cutting-edge bedside noninvasive OCT imaging. I have a PhD  in neuroscience and a longstanding interest in the development of neuronal and vascular systems. My  immediate career goal in the current proposal is to perform simultaneous imaging of the retinal  neuronal and vascular microstructures in the macula and retinal periphery in preterm infants, and  correlate these changes in preterm infants with retinopathy of prematurity (ROP). With a K23  Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award, I will acquire additional didactic  training in clinical research and mentored research experience in pediatric retinal development,  retinal imaging, photonics, clinical research and responsible conduct of research.  Environment: The mentorship and expertise of the advisory committee, the extensive resources at  Duke Eye Center and Department of Biomedical Engineering at Duke University, and the significant  institutional commitment will provide me with the support needed to transition successfully into an  independent research career.  Research: The focus of this proposal is to test the hypothesis that retinal neuronal and vascular  development are coordinated, and vascular pathology parallels defective neuronal development during  ROP. We will assess simultaneously retinal neuronal and vascular development using advanced retinal  optical coherence tomography (OCT) imaging technologies. In Specific Aim 1, we will implement a  neonatal OCT research system to capture macular vascular development and analyze the correlation  between neuronal and vascular development in preterm infants. Specifically, we will assess the size  and vascular pattern of the foveal avascular zone and correlate with the foveal pit depth and  retinal microstructures. In Specific Aim 2, we will investigate pathological neurovascular  patterning in the retinal periphery in infants with ROP, and identify earlier subclinical features  that may predict treatment-requiring disease. In Specific Aim 3, we will delineate factors and/or  systemic diseases that affect retinal neurovascular development and patterning in preterm infants,  such as stage of ROP, presence of plus disease, presence of macular edema of prematurity, presence  of attenuated nerve fiber layers, ROP treatments (anti-VEGF or laser treatments) and systemic  factors such as hypoxia. This body of work, which will constitute the basis of an R01 grant, will  advance our understanding of retinal neurovascular patterning and pathogenesis of pediatric retinal  vascular diseases such as ROP."
"9405275","This proposal presents an academic-industrial partnership to develop an instrument for 2-photon laser scanning microscopy (2p-LSM) in non-human primates (NHP) for transformative basic science and clinical translation. Our team combines academic strengths in neuroscience and neural engineering at New York University (PI Pesaran, co-I's Movshon and Peron) and industrial engineering at ThorLabs (led by Jeff Brooker, Vice-President of Life Sciences) to translate recent advances in 2p-LSM imaging by Karel Svoboda and his group at Janelia Research Campus to the monkey. Many researchers who study the primate brain would like to add 2p-LSM to their experimental toolkit. Unfortunately, no existing microscope can be used for NHP work without significant customization due to the size and shape of the primate brain. We plan to design an instrument that will overcome these challenges and serve a community of researchers. Recently, a 2-photon random-access mesoscope, or 2p-RAM, has been developed. The 2p-RAM has the same spatial resolution as a standard 2p-LSM but uses a novel optical strategy to scan a 5 mm field of view, up 1 mm deep. The current 2p-RAM is designed for use in the mouse. To adapt it for NHP use, we propose to work with Thor Labs to develop a manipulator that can position the objective lens with six degrees of freedom over any optically accessible part of the cortical surface. We expect the new instrument to provide: 1- Random access scanning to image populations of neurons selected for study. In the mouse, roughly 10,000 neurons can be selected from larger populations and their activity imaged simultaneously; 2 - Motorized control to position and reposition the objective at micron spatial resolution and micro-radian angular resolution. This will allow users with different target areas to share an instrument; 3 - Dynamic access scanning to move the objective quickly and precisely to image multiple 5-mm fields of view. This will make possible integrated measurements of populations of neurons in many different brain regions; 4 - Software to control the instrument and acquire the data. In Aim 1, we develop a motorized platform for NHP-optimized imaging using the microscope and optimize the associated surgical procedures. In Aim 2, we develop a motorized platform for NHP-optimized imaging using the 2p-RAM. In each Aim, we develop software to control the instrument and acquire the data it will generate. At the end of the project, Thor Labs will develop, build, and sell the technology commercially. In addition, we will disseminate the technology openly, including documentation for instrument fabrication and user training. A key strength of our proposal will be a community of users with stated interest in using the device and we provide many letters of support. This instrument will be a major advance for research on the primate brain and will drive advances in human health."
"9338110","Project Summary Sexual violence is a widespread public health problem, with as many as 40% of women and 23% of men experiencing forced sexual contact at some point in their lives.1 The research and practice communities have expanded efforts related to understanding and preventing perpetration of sexual violence, rather than focusing exclusively on preventing sexual violence victimization. The CDC has identified a number of shared risk factors (such as exposure to relationship and family violence, low familial cohesion, and association with at-risk peers) that are connected with multiple forms of violence, including sexual violence. Using a matched pair control design, this study will evaluate the efficacy of a strengths-based curriculum, the Council for Boys and Young Men, to reduce risk for future sexual violence perpetration with middle school-aged boys (ages 12-14). We will collect baseline data at enrollment, and post- intervention data immediately after the course, then at 6 and 12 months after training. We will measure several outcomes linked to sexual assault perpetration, including bystander behavior, attitudes related to gender roles and acceptance of sexual violence, interpersonal relations, and youth-adult connectedness. Factors that impact implementation will also be assessed in order to examine the extent to which fidelity and quality influence participants' outcomes. The results of this study will inform future Rape Prevention and Education (RPE) program activities and expand the understanding of upstream sexual violence prevention."
"9446620","PROJECT ABSTRACT The proposed Bay Area Team Against Resistance U54 Project (BATAR-UP) is an interdisciplinary effort of investigators to apply their knowledge and expertise to dissect the molecular and cellular basis of incomplete response and resistance to current treatments and to identify new treatment strategies to better neutralize or eliminate residual disease and prevent resistance. This translational approach will be part of the NCI's Drug Resistance and Sensitivity Centers Network to develop innovative strategies to understand and combat mechanisms of tumor resistance and exploit tumor sensitivity to anti-cancer therapies.  To accomplish this, BATAR-UP will support two projects and one core driven by a multidisciplinary team of investigators at UCSF and Stanford University. Project 1 will define and interrogate the molecular and cellular basis of residual disease in lung cancers treated with targeted inhibitors in clinical use. We will prioritize for initial study both EGFR-mutant and ALK gene rearrangement positive lung cancers, given their importance as key molecular disease subtypes and our prior published work and expertise. We will harness genetic and transcriptomic analysis of clinical samples (liquid and tumor biopsies) to provide a molecular view of the evolution of response, residual disease, and acquired resistance. We will generate organoid and PDX models and apply cutting-edge functional screens (genetic, pharmacologic, and targeted proteomic assays) to identify key vulnerabilities that could be therapeutically exploited, including with CTEP agents. This systematic approach will allow us to reveal the basis of the incomplete response and residual disease that drives EGFR and ALK inhibitor resistance and pinpoint therapeutic strategies to intercept the evolution of residual disease and eventual acquired resistance. Project 2 will define and interrogate the molecular and cellular basis of resistance and residual disease in lung cancers treated with current immunotherapies, including PD-1 and PD- L1 antibodies. Leveraging shared platforms in synergy with Project 1, we will perform systematic analyses of liquid and tumor biopsy specimens (and ex vivo models) obtained from patients longitudinally before and during treatment and upon acquired resistance. We will focus our studies on EGFR and ALK wild type patients, including squamous cell lung cancer and adenocarcinoma patients where immunotherapy has shown efficacy but is typically non-curative. We will leverage (1) a novel lung cancer organoid model wherein tumor biopsies are cultured as both tumor epithelium and their endogenous tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) en bloc as a cohesive unit, and (2) deep droplet-based single-cell RNA-seq analysis. Our systematic approach will help define the basis of the incomplete response and residual disease that contributes to immunotherapy resistance and identify potential new therapeutic strategies to help convert these incomplete responses into curative outcomes. Our Administrative Core will provide leadership, coordination and oversight for BATAR-UP with the overarching goal of synergizing the research conducted in the 2 Projects and the entire DRSC network."
"9448590","This proposal will seek to identify and characterize the genetic factors that modulate disease activity and progression in multiple sclerosis (MS). The project builds on the hypothesis that allelic variants affecting disease trajectory are eminently identifiable through adequately powered unbiased genetic screens, and will thus employ a multi-dimensional statistical analysis to identify key gene networks and biological processes underlying disease progression. In order to minimize the confounding influence of the temporary fluctuations in disability that result from the relapsing inflammatory activity that characterizes the early stages of MS the discovery phase of this project will focus exclusively on older subjects (aged at least 55) with a long disease duration (>10 years). Since typically less than 1 in 7 patients satisfy these criteria this approach is only possible because of the enormous bio-specimen resource available to the International Multiple Sclerosis Genetics Consortium (IMSGC) (>62,000 cases). We will use the Multiple Sclerosis Severity Score (MSSS) as our measure of progression; an ordinal decile score that indicates how a patient's Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) ranks in comparison with other patients with the same duration of disease. The IMSGC has DNA from almost 9,000 older long disease duration patients that have at least one MSSS measure. For maximal efficiency we will screen these 9,000 cases in collaboration with our colleagues from the Karolinska Institute in Sweden. Replicated results will be immediately analyzed in the context of cell-specific pathways and top candidates will be subsequently explored for genetic interactions, including their functional validation. Specifically, in Aim 1 we will conduct a GWAS on 4,000 patients using the latest generation of genotyping chips, which through imputation will allow us to assess more than 70 million variants. In Specific Aim 2 we will then replicate the most associated markers identified in aim 1 in the remaining 5,000 samples, conduct additional replications in at least two more independent sample populations, a meta-analysis, and perform bioinformatics and experimental validation of the most promising associations. Combining the data across both efforts will provide power to identify variants accounting for as little as 0.5% of variances in MSSS. The identification of genetic modifiers of disease expression will have profound translational implications for the understanding and management of MS, and in particular for progressive MS, the most disabling and currently untreatable form of the disease."
"9440675","Project Summary Two coding sequence genetic variants in APOL1 commonly found in people of Western Sub-Saharan Africa ancestry (SSAA) are associated with kidney diseases such as Focal Segmental Glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), Hypertension Attributed-End Stage Kidney Disease, and HIV-Associated Nephropathy(HIVAN). The presence of 2 APOL1- risk alleles in SSAA deceased donors is associated with 2-to-4-times higher risk of renal graft loss in the recipient. Living donors with APOL1 risk alleles may be at risk for kidney disease and excluded from donating. This application seeks to establish a large consortium of Organ Procurement Organizations (OPO) and Transplant Centers called the APOLLO-CREED?APOL1 Long-term Outcomes-Consortium for Responsible and Ethical Evaluation of organ Donation to: 1) define the outcomes of transplantation from a donor with 2 APOL1 risk alleles to guide clinical and cost-effective organ use, and define the health outcomes of living donors according to APOL1 genotype to guide living donor selection; 2) quantify outcomes of non- renal (e.g. liver) organs transplanted from donors with two APOL1 risk alleles; and 3) inform the ethical foundation of APOL1 testing for deceased donor allocation and living donor selection. To accomplish these goals, the APOLLO-CREED will consist of over 10 Organ Procurement Organizations and over 20 large and small volume, adult and pediatric Transplant Centers, from a wide geographical area to collect blood and clinical data from living and deceased donors of African Ancestry (AA) and from recipients of organs from these donors. Biospecimens for APOL1 genetic analysis will be mailed directly to the Data Coordinating Center (DCC). Clinical outcomes of all recipients of organs from donors at risk for APOL1 alleles will be ascertained through linkage to data already collected by the United Network of Organ Sharing (UNOS) as captured in the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients (SRTR) databases and uploaded to the DCC. Health outcomes for living donors/candidates will be integrated through linkage to the new SRTR ?Living Donor Collective.? Cost data linked to the SRTR are also available and will be used to support cost-effectiveness analyses that could inform national allocation policy. A bioethicist with transplant experience will assist in the design and performance of the study and aid in the translation of the results to widespread clinical use. This efficient study design requires minimal time, effort, and cost from OPOs and Transplant Centers."
"9381802","Project Summary  While AR has been extensively characterized as a transcriptional activator, it was recently reported to function as a transcriptional repressor to suppress a subset of genes. Significantly, through AR ChIP-seq and transcriptome profiling in prostate cancer cells we have found that the directly AR-repressed genes are highly enriched for DNA replication function and majority of those genes were consistently increased in CRPC clinical samples. We then discovered that this direct transcriptional repression activity of AR was mediated by androgen-stimulated recruitment of hypophosphorylated Rb. Androgens is also known to stimulate growth by further AR transcriptional activation of genes driving lipid and sterol synthesis, and other metabolic functions, with subsequent cyclin dependent kinase activation and Rb hyperphosphorylation. Overexpression of AR in prostate cancer cells could overcome this growth stimulatory effect. These findings demonstrate that AR has an Rb-dependent anti-proliferative function, which may be compromised in CRPC cells with Rb-deficiency and could be enhanced by blocking Rb phosphorylation. The objective of this proposal is to determine the function roles of AR recruitment of Rb in regulating transcription of DNA replication genes and cell cycle progression of PCa tumor cells (specific aim 1), to determine the molecular basis for AR interaction with hypophosphorylated Rb and characterize the distinct Rb complex recruited by AR to the suppression sits (specific aim 2), and to conduct a genome wide analysis to identify Rb dependent AR suppression sites and determine the mechanism of actions and function roles of these sites in prostate cancer cells (specific aim 3)."
"9515180","Abstract Exercise is a powerful and pleiotropic physiological stimulus that helps prevent many chronic diseases and is used as a therapeutic for disease. While the beneficial effects of exercise are extensively acknowledged there is still very little understood about the molecular transducers of the systems-wide effects. The goal of this University of Florida Molecular Transducers of Physical Activity Preclinical Animal Study Sites application (UF PASS) is to conduct experiments in animals that will provide tissues/blood (i.e. biospecimens) to the Chemical Analysis Sites for identification of molecular transducers induced by defined models of physical activity from tissues that cannot be obtained from humans as well as to conduct mechanistic studies that can support screening of novel transducers to quickly move the field forward. In Phase 1, UF PASS proposes to collect biospecimens for the Chemical Analysis sites following endurance (run-training) or resistance exercise protocols on male and female Fischer 344xBrown Norway rats (F344-BN) at three different ages. To better capture the dynamics of the exercise/adaptation responses we propose to: 1) Collect biospecimens at 5 selected timepoints following an acute bout of exercise on naïve and trained rats; 2) Collect biospecimens following short duration training (after 5 bouts) and 3) Collect biospecimens following long-term (8 weeks) training. For Phase 2, our hypothesis is that factors released from muscle (i.e. myokines) are the molecular transducers that function throughout the system to improve the well-established stress tolerance. The goal of these studies will be to employ high throughput screening technologies to test up to 1500 myokines. We will then use secondary screening techniques to test 100 candidates from which we will select up to 3 candidates for in vivo testing. The results of the experiments in Aim 3 will provide molecular evidence identifying a set of transducers, released from muscle, that are necessary for exercise induced systemic health. The goals of the UF PASS will be pursued by the following Specific Aims: Specific Aim 1: Center Coordination Phase. Specific Aim 2: Phase 1 Studies. To perform endurance and resistance exercise using male and female F344BN rats at 3-4, 16-18, and 27-29 mo. Specific Aim 3: Phase 2 Studies. The goal in Aim 3 is to test myokines as the exercise transducers for improved stress tolerance."
"9518210","Glaucoma is a diverse group of chronic diseases that causes irreversible damage to the optic nerve and is a leading cause of blindness affecting 67 million people worldwide. It is estimated that 1 in 10 people who receive ?proper? treatment for glaucoma still experience loss of vision. The only proven method of treating glaucoma is to reduce the pressure in the eye (Intraocular Pressure; IOP). Advanced glaucoma must achieve IOP in the low teens to stop progression. Unfortunately, less-invasive therapies like anti-glaucoma drugs and laser surgery do not commonly achieve these low IOPs; therefore, surgical intervention is required. Standard glaucoma surgeries are suboptimal with unpredictable outcomes and high complication rates. Camras Vision has created a biocompatible microchannel shunt capable of regulating IOP. Our preliminary data demonstrate that the prototype can be used to set in vitro pressure based on the number and length of microchannels within the outlet tube. The key to the Camras Shunt?s success is its design to drain aqueous humor externally, thereby, avoiding failure due to scarring within the drainage site associated with all other glaucoma surgeries. In this Fast-Track application, we will create a new generation shunt, the Titratable Camras Shunt (tCS), to enable precise control of IOP. In Phase I, we will construct a tCS prototype consisting of two outlet tubes (initially sealed with sutures), each containing a single microchannel, that allows for noninvasive manipulation postoperatively. Opening and closing of individual tubes controls and adjusts the target IOP range. Additionally, the tubes can be trimmed in 0.5 mm increments to fine-tune the IOP postoperatively. In vitro fluid dynamic testing (Aim 1) will be used to assess the ability to set pressure ranges to 10-14 mmHg with one open channel and 6-10 mmHg with two open channels, and to use tube trimming to reduce resistance 3-5% with each cut of the outlet tube. The feasibility of precisely controlling IOP in vivo (Aim 2) will be assessed in cynomolgus monkeys, which exhibit similar ocular fluid dynamics as humans, over 3 months in partnership with Dr. Carol Toris (University of Nebraska Medical Center). Success and justification for progression to Phase II will be indicated by the ability to set in vivo IOPs to 10-14 mmHg and 6-10 mmHg, maintain IOP lowering in a 2-month follow-up period (IOP does not increase more than ± 2 mmHg), reduce IOP by 3-5% with tube trimming with no evidence of adverse effects to the monkeys. In Phase II, we will optimize scale-up manufacturing in partnership with Sil-Pro Medical Manufacturing Solutions. The manufactured devices will be tested after sterilization (by radiation or ethylene oxide) based on FDA guidelines for ?Aqueous Shunts - 510(k) Submissions,? which will first include flow, stability, uniformity, and mechanical testing at Camras facilities (Aim 3). Biocompatibility/toxicity testing to evaluate safety (Aim 4), which includes systemic toxicity, genotoxicity, chemical testing, and 6-month rabbit ocular biocompatibility assessments, will be conducted at NAMSA, a GLP (good laboratory practice)-approved CRO with extensive ophthalmic experience. Success will be indicated if the final form tCS meets or exceeds guidelines set forth by the FDA for Aqueous Shunts to enable Camras Vision to submit a 510(k) application. Once commercialized, we anticipate that the tCS will make glaucoma surgery as accessible as cataract surgery, which is known for its elegant surgery, effectiveness, and minimal complications. Moreover, the proposed shunt should enable ophthalmologists to target IOP with a quick and simple procedures (tube opening and trimming) that can be maintained via routine follow-up outpatient visits."
"9421913","PROJECT SUMMARY Alzheimer?s disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia. Underlying pathological and physiological changes related to the onset and progression of AD are believed to emerge several years prior to clinical manifestations. Gait abnormalities and motor slowing typically precede the diagnosis of AD by a decade or more, presenting the exciting possibility that changes in gait may act as early noninvasive biomarkers for AD. Previous work by our group has identified key markers of impending and/or accelerated gait speed decline based on physiological measures of the energy cost of slow walking, peak energy capacity, and quantities and patterns of objectively measured free-living physical activity (PA), making them potential preclinical markers of early AD pathology. We propose to use 8 years of existing longitudinal data, and ongoing/new data collection in nearly 1,000 older adults in the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA), to examine the roles of altered energy reserves, and reduced and fragmented daily PA as precursors to clinical markers of Alzheimer?s disease and neuronal injury, which include A? deposition using [11C]-Pittsburgh compound B positron emission tomography, brain atrophy using structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and cognitive performance. We will also explore potential vascular mechanisms linking energy reserves and PA to these outcomes, including cerebral blood flow, ankle brachial index, and pulse wave velocity, as well as the role of mediating or modifying factors such as inflammation and the apolipoprotein E genotype. The BLSA is a continuously enrolled cohort study of aging that already contains repeated measures of cognition and adjudication of cognitive status, in which a subset completes repeated MRI and PiB PET scans. Importantly, our preliminary cross-sectional data from the BLSA indicate strong associations among energy reserves, cognitive performance, b-amyloid burden, and diurnal patterns of daily PA. We propose to investigate the longitudinal associations among these variables to identify physiological thresholds of poor energy reserve and reduced and fragmented patterns of diurnal PA as early precursors to the onset and progression of AD pathology. A better understanding of the association between energy reserves/PA, subclinical AD pathology, and cognitive performance may elucidate a physiological threshold of diminished energy reserve that is associated with increased risk of poor cognitive outcomes over time, and increase our understanding of the complex association between declines in physical and cognitive functioning with age. Moreover, uncovering patterns of daily free-living PA most commonly associated with this threshold will help define a phenotype of reduced and/or fragmented PA that signifies impending emergence and progression of AD. Given the proliferation of wearable devices to monitor PA in the consumer and research markets, identifying changes in PA consistent with the development of AD pathology could provide evidence for future wide-scale screening for early detection of persons at high risk of AD."
"9448915","The neocortex, a structure covering mammalian brains, computes high-order sensory, motor, and cognitive processes. Over the course of evolution, the neocortex of certain species expanded dramatically and folded, thereby providing superior sensorimotor and cognitive abilities. The immense expansion of the neocortex in humans has made possible the complex behavior, cognition, and intellect that are unique to humans. Neocortical expansion and folding reflect an increase in the number of neural cells and are thus dependent on the number of neural progenitor/stem cells. The long-term goal of this project is to understand the mechanisms regulating neural progenitor/stem cell expansion and the growth and folding of the neocortex. Sonic hedgehog (Shh) signaling promotes the expansion of neural progenitor/stem cells, leading to the growth and folding of the neocortex in mice. Shh signaling also increases the number of neural progenitor/stem cells in human cerebral organoids, a miniature model of the developing brain grown from human pluripotent stem cells. The short-term goal of this project is to understand how Shh signaling expands neural progenitor/stem cells. Shh signaling controls the expression of a set of genes (Shh effectors) to exert its biological activity. This project has two main components: 1) the expression of Shh effectors will be artificially increased or decreased in neural progenitor/stem cells in mice and human cerebral organoids in order to understand how Shh effectors regulate neural progenitor/stem cells; and 2) the strength of Shh signaling will be increased or decreased in ferret fetuses and ferret brain slices to investigate whether and how Shh signaling regulates neural progenitor/stem cells in intact animals with folded brains. The proposed research will provide deeper insights into the mechanisms underlying neocortical expansion and folding and the etiology of neurodevelopmental diseases."
"9356696","Project Summary Breakdown of the inner endothelial blood-retinal barrier (BRB) is a major cause of retinal edema and resultant vision loss in vascular eye diseases. In addition to paracellular transport though the tight junctions between endothelial cells (ECs), transportation of substance, particularly large molecules, also occurs through transcellular vesicles (transcytosis) across ECs. Normal healthy blood vessels in the central nervous system, including retinas, display low rates of transcytosis essential for maintaining blood-brain barrier (BBB) and inner BRB. Yet molecular mechanisms governing retinal EC transcytosis are poorly understood, which considerably limits our ability to manipulate inner BRB to treat vascular eye disease. In this project we identified that Wnt signaling pathway, a pathway fundamentally important for angiogenesis and vascular integrity control, may act as a critical negative regulator of EC transcytosis to maintain inner BRB. Mutations in the inter-related Wnt signaling pathway involving the ligand Norrin, and the receptor Frizzled4 and co-receptor low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 5 (LRP5) are linked with development of familial exudative vitreoretinopathy (FEVR) and Norrie disease, both with inner endothelial BRB breakdown. Activation of canonical Wnt signaling involves stabilization of ?-catenin, which then translocates to the nucleus to bind nuclear T-cell factor /lymphoid enhancer factor (TCF/LEF) to influence target genes. Our preliminary data show that loss of Wnt signaling in mouse models of FEVR and Norrie disease (Lrp5-/- and Norriny/- mice) significantly increased EC transcytosis, with decreased levels of MFSD2a (major facilitator super family domain containing 2a), a membrane transporter protein that suppresses EC transcytosis. We hypothesize that Wnt signaling is essential for maintaining a low transcytosis rate in retinal EC critical for inner BRB integrity, through Mfsd2a-dependent caveola vesicle modulation. We will test this hypothesis with three aims. In Aim 1 we will determine whether Wnt signaling controls EC transcytosis by measuring vascular permeability of both small and large molecules in Lrp5-/- and Norriny/- retinas, as well as in EC culture using transcytosis assay with Wnt modulation. In Aim 2 we will determine whether Wnt signaling regulates EC transcytosis through transcriptional regulation of MFSD2a, a transcytotic inhibitor, using a combination of ex vivo and in vitro approaches. In Aim 3, we will delineate whether Wnt signaling and MFSD2a control MFSD2a-assisted caveolar vesicle formation, transportation, and exocytosis. This proposed work will uncover novel fundamental molecular mechanisms governing EC transcytosis and inner BRB integrity, which is of significance in aiding development of improved strategies to manipulate inner BRB. Findings from this work will also be highly relevant for modulation of BBB in the central nervous system, as well as development of drug delivery methods through BBB and inner BRB."

"9562704","Exchange of extracellular vesicles (EVs, referring to exosomes and microvesicles) has emerged as a novel mechanism of cell-cell communication in the central nervous system, but very little is known about the biological function of those transfers in health or disease. Astrocytes, one of the most abundant cell types of the central nervous system (CNS), secrete EVs that can be beneficial or detrimental to neuronal fitness depending on their activation state, thus implying that astrocyte-derived EVs can modulate brain resilience and vulnerability to stress. Interestingly, we have recently observed that apolipoprotein E (APOE), the most relevant genetic risk modulator of Alzheimer?s disease (AD), can be found in association with EVs isolated from astrocytes in vitro, the major cell type producing APOE in the brain. While APOE has been known for decades as the primary carrier of lipids between neural cells and a strong partner of Amyloid ? peptides in AD (APOE4 and APOE2 respectively increasing or decreasing amyloid buildup in the brain and conferring higher risk or protection toward the disease), this discovery suggests a novel role of APOE in modulating the transfer of many other biologically active compounds through EVs, including nucleic acids. The present proposal therefore hypothesizes that the exchange of EVs between astrocytes and neurons can be differentially modulated by each APOE isoform, depends upon astroglial reactivity and is, at least in part, responsible for some non-cell autonomous effects in aging and Alzheimer?s disease. To investigate those exciting questions, we will further characterize the association of APOE with astrocyte-derived EVs from human brain samples, analyze the nucleic acid content of EVs released from resting or reactive astrocytes and monitor in vivo and in vitro, how those parameters (APOE isoforms and activation state of astrocytes) may eventually impact EV neuronal uptake. Importantly, because EVs are small particles that cannot be readily observed by conventional microscopy and because all cell types can secrete and capture EVs, studying their exchanges in vivo has proven very challenging. To circumvent this problem, we have developed a novel reporter system based on the secretion of astrocyte-derived EVs containing Cre recombinase mRNA (donor cell type) and on the expression of a Cre-sensitive reporter in neurons (recipient cell type). Using this innovative ?ON/OFF? reporter system, we will be able, for the first time, to study the dynamic transfers of EVs from astrocytes to neurons in the living mouse brain by multiphoton-imaging, determine if those processes are modulated by the nature of each APOE variant and exacerbated after LPS-induced neuroinflammation, upon aging or in the context of AD neuropathological changes. Importantly, we will also be able to sort recipient neurons from non-recipient neurons from the same biological environment and establish the specific transcriptional changes that distinguish both populations, eventually correlating those findings with our initial screen of RNA cargos detected in EVs isolated from resting and reactive astrocytes. Considering the paucity of knowledge in the field, the current project will advance our understanding in the biological relevance of EV-based cell-cell communication in the context of aging or neurodegeneration, eventually opening novel avenues of investigation."
"9366094","PROJECT SUMMARY  Currently, surgical intervention is the only cure for cataracts, though this can be complicated in patients with diabetes. One of the most common postoperative complications in patients suffering from diabetes is persistent inflammation (uveitis) that can cause significant corneal edema, posterior synechia, and progression of diabetic retinopathy or neovascular glaucoma. There is substantial evidence that secondary cataract formation due to health conditions such as diabetes are associated with increased inflammation, oxidative stress, and sorbitol accumulation, along with covalent bonding of a protein or lipid molecule with a sugar molecule causing an increase in advanced glycosylation end products (AGE) formation that can cause significant damage to cells and tissues. The efforts to combat these effects using traditional drugs often leads to severe side effects outweighing the benefits. On the other hand natural compounds such as curcumin offer promise, but their progress is hampered due to lack of suitable dosage forms and poor bioavailability. In order to overcome inferior physicochemical and pharmacological attributes of curcumin we have prepared biodegradable nanosystems of polylactide-co-glycolide (PLGA) encapsulating curcumin (nCUR). These passively absorbed nCUR when given 8 mg/kg/day were significantly more effective than plain curcumin in delaying diabetic cataract in rodents, independent of glucose reduction. Despite the enhanced performance of passive nCUR, a significant dose remained unabsorbed in the intestine, indicating potential for further improvement through active-nanosystems. For the first time, we present a non-competitive active transport strategy to improve drug transport across biological barriers by developing carrier systems that have no equivalent in the world of competitive ligands. We hypothesize that transferrin receptor (TfR) mediated delivery across the intestinal barriers (IB) and blood ocular barriers (BOB) would significantly enhance the transport of the nanosystems making systemic anti-inflammatory therapy a reality.  In this proposal, we will continue our studies on non-competitive active drug delivery strategy and understand how the systemic anti-inflammatory therapy will prevent or delay diabetic cataracts and manage post-surgical inflammation. To test this hypothesis, we propose the following specific aims: AIM #1. Establish the effectiveness of TfR in facilitating the transport of PLGA-GA NS across the IB and BOB in rat model. AIM #2. Establish the magnitude of desired or undesired effects in suitable rat models as a result of active transport. AIM #3. We will verify performance of this delivery strategy in a more man-like model. At the end of this study, we will have an effective systemic anti-inflammatory therapy to prevent or delay diabetic cataracts and treat post- surgical inflammation."
"9368938","Abstract A key aspect to antiretroviral target identification is understanding the nature molecular interactions, which when perturbed, can result interfere with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) replication. An underexplored aspect of the HIV-1 replication cycle for discovery of novel antiviral targets has been the steps involved in virus particle assembly. This is due, in part, to the relatively poor understanding of this phase of virus replication ? specifically as it relates to the behavior of Gag movement to the plasma membrane, the engagement of particle budding sites, the molecular Gag-Gag interactions that create the immature Gag lattice, and subsequent particle biogenesis. Detailed comparative analysis of close relatives can be highly informative for the discovery of key antiretroviral targets for drug development. For instance, recent evidence indicates that Gag-Gag interactions differ among retroviruses, which helps explain morphological differences among immature retrovirus particles. Furthermore, we have made key preliminary observations of differences in the pathways for Gag nucleation leading to punctum formation, as well as the nature of particle biogenesis also remain poorly understood aspects of the retrovirus assembly pathway, particularly among human immunodeficiency virus type 1 and its close relatives ? i.e., human immunodeficiency virus type 2 (HIV-2) and human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1). In this application, we propose to investigate retrovirus immature particle structure and particle biogenesis through innovative state-of-the-art experimental approaches. In particular, we will apply cryo-electron microscopy/tomography (cryo-EM/ET), total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy, photoactivated localization microscopy (PALM), and the novel single-molecule technology of fluorescence fluctuation spectroscopy (FFS) in living cells to investigate 1) comparative analysis of immature Gag lattice structures, 2) investigate the nature of human retrovirus particle biogenesis, and 3) investigate the pathways for the nucleation of Gag oligomerization. These novel studies harness innovative technologies in order to provide new insights into a highly significant and poorly understood aspect of the HIV-1 life cycle and lead to the identification of antiretroviral targets for exploiting by intervention using small molecules."
"9566389","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): As people age, they are much less likely to fall victim to a single isolated disease. Instead, competing causes of death more directly associated with biological aging cluster within individuals as they approach later ages. These conditions elevate mortality risk, as well as create the frailty and disability profile that can accompany old age. Th USC Roybal Center for Health Policy Simulation models these complex dynamics and predicts how social policy and social forces will affect the welfare of current and future generations of th elderly. Our thematic emphasis is on 'Novel methods for analyzing programs affecting older populations.' The goals are to: 1. Research the determinants of health and health spending among older populations; 2. Develop models to understand the consequences of social policy, social forces, and biomedicine for health, health spending, and health care delivery; and 3. Translate these findings for policy makers who influence aging policy. For the current renewal, we will continue our translational efforts to elevate aging policy discussions in two areas of emphasis: Theme 1: Policies to Mitigate the Social Consequences of Health Disparities; and Theme 2: International Lessons for U.S. Aging Policy. Our preliminary work suggests that focusing research in these areas has the potential for improving the health and well-being of older people, and that these are areas for which both researchers and policy-makers should devote more attention. Dissemination to Federal agencies in the United States, international government, and online continues to be a strength of our Center, and a focus of our renewal efforts. To reach these goals, our two proposed cores will continue our best practices to ensure that novel findings and tools are disseminated to decision makers in industry, clinical settings, and the government, and that the research programs are developed in directions which ensure independent funding. The Management and Administrative Core will provide visionary leadership and effective management, while the Pilot Core will select projects leveraging the Center's existing research and the broad range of research being conducted among a large network of collaborators. We will also continue to make our models and programming core available to researchers from around the world."
"9562721","Alzheimer?s disease (AD) is a public health crisis that continues to grow as the population ages, demanding new insights into pathophysiology. AD, a progressive neurodegenerative disease, is now the sixth-leading cause of death in the United States, places a burden of nearly half a trillion dollars per year on caregivers and taxpayers, and is expected to double in prevalence within the next decade. The pathophysiology of AD includes the loss of synaptic connections through neurodegeneration and the prion-like spread of proteinopathies including extracellular deposition of ?-amyloid peptides (A?). In sporadic AD, variants of the apolipoprotein E gene (APOE) have emerged as the greatest apparent risk factor, and AD has an outsized effect on aging women. Extracellular vesicles (EVs), including exosomes, have recently emerged as important players in AD pathophysiology (26?28). Comprising a diversity of double-leaflet membrane-bound particles, EVs have been reported by several groups including ours to spread proteins implicated in pathogenesis both in vitro and in vivo. Certain types of EVs have also been suggested to alleviate AD symptoms and may serve as therapeutic options. However, much remains to be learned and exploited in the relationship of AD and EVs in APOE- and gender-associated contexts. We plan to address this need, focusing innovative techniques and tools on the problem. We hypothesize firstly (Aims 1-3) that powerful induced pluripotent stem cell models of neurons and astrocytes, two cell types of central importance in AD, will facilitate screens of factors likely involved in AD pathogenesis via EVs. Secondly (Aims 2 and 3), membrane trafficking and membrane surface proteins will contribute to EV release, AD-related cargo loading, and effects on recipient. Thirdly and finally, (Aim 4), modulating EVs in novel organoid and animal models will also modulate disease-related markers and processes."
"9239322","Cell surface glycosylation is dynamic and often changes in response to cellular differentiation. Changes in glycosylation can impart a function to cells through glycan-binding proteins. Well-documented changes in cellular glycosylation occur in an immune response when B-cells differentiate into germinal center (GC) B cells. Immunologists routinely use these changes in glycosylation to identify the GC, using the antibody GL7, which is a structure within secondary lymphoid organs where antibody affinity maturation takes place. Remarkably, no function has been attributed to these changes in glycosylation. The change in glycosylation detected by GL7 is intriguing because of its relevance to CD22, a glycan-binding protein and member of the Siglec family of immunomodulatory receptors. CD22 is a negative regulator of the B-cell receptor (BCR) through its ability to recruit the phosphatase SHP-1, although its function in GC B-cells has remained largely unexplored. Specifically, GL7 recognizes a glycan that is a low affinity ligand for CD22; hence, GC B-cells loose the high affinity glycan ligand of CD22 found abundantly on naïve B-cells. High affinity glycan ligands of CD22 regulate its spatial organization on the surface of naïve B-cells, maintaining CD22 and BCR in different microdomains. Accordingly, we hypothesize that loss of high affinity CD22 ligands in GC B-cells promotes the association of CD22 with the BCR. This hypothesis is particularly intriguing in light of recent findings demonstrating that BCR signaling is inhibited in GC B-cells through constitutive co-localization of SHP-1 with the BCR. This project aims to test this hypothesis by assessing: (Aim1) the functional consequence of modulating expression of CD22 or its glycan ligands specifically in GC B-cells; (Aim2) whether changes in glycan ligands in GC B-cells drives co-localization of CD22 with the BCR, which is responsible for recruitment SHP-1 and inhibiting BCR signaling; and (3) the consequence of disrupting the function of CD22 in the context of an antibody-mediated autoimmune disease. Key to testing the hypothesis is a transgenic mouse we have established that maintains expression of high affinity glycan ligands for CD22 in GC B-cells. Preliminary results demonstrate that maintaining high affinity CD22 ligands in GC B-cells results in decreased competitiveness for the GC B-cell repertoire in competition with WT GC B-cells; an effect that requires expression of CD22. If preliminary results reflect a truly GC-specific role for CD22, we expect that modulating expression of CD22 or its glycan ligands in a GC-specific manner will likewise impair GC B-cell responses, increase BCR signaling in GC B-cells, and abrogate disease progression in a mouse model of antibody- mediated autoimmune disease. The long-term objective of this project is to establish the role(s) played by CD22 in the GC reaction in both health and disease. This knowledge will provide new insights into how an ongoing immune response can be modulated to treat an antibody-mediated autoimmune disease."
"9418977","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT There is growing evidence for the role of stress in cardiovascular pathologies, cancer, and other diseases. Work from our group and others has shown that psychological states such as chronic stress or depression may accelerate growth of existing tumors and promote chemoresistance. Importantly, a significant number of ovarian cancer patients are clinically depressed or lack social support. These emotional states have been linked to sustained activation of the sympathetic nervous system and decreased survival. Our group has shown that activation of the sympathetic nervous system leads to increased levels of norepinephrine and epinephrine in the tumor microenvironment and ovarian cancer progression by inducing pro-tumoral pathways. Our preliminary data in cancer cell lines suggest that norepinephrine significantly changes the expression of genes implicated in ovarian cancer and attenuates cisplatin-induced ovarian cancer cell apoptosis. Given the importance of BRCA1-regulated DNA repair mechanisms in cisplatin response, adrenergic regulation of BRCA1 expression in tumors may also impact ovarian cancer progression and resistance to platinum-based therapy. However, the underlying mechanisms behind these observations are not completely understood. In this pilot we will test this hypothesis by achieving the following aims: 1) To dissect the effects of adrenergic signaling in ovarian cancer cells and 2) To explore the association between perceived stress and depressive symptomatology with tumor catecholamines, DNA damage, and BRCA1 protein expression. This proposal provides a unique approach to explore the link between stress and ovarian cancer outcomes at both the tumor level and the patient level. This proposal will provide the groundwork for additional research on precision medicine by linking psychological risk factors with underlying tumor biology."
"9349487","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) has profound implications for clinicians - they are expected to adopt and actively utilize electronic health records (EHRs), or be subject to financial penalties. One month after ARRA was signed, however, the National Research Council (NRC) concluded that the nationwide deployment of EHRs called for by ARRA might set back 21st century healthcare goals. The central conclusion of the NRC report was that current EHRs do not provide cognitive support for health care clinicians. Further, if clinician cognitive work is not supported, patient care and outcomes suffer. The latest research on EHRs suggests slow but increasing adoption rates, mixed results regarding quality of care and safety improvement, no reduction in costs of care, and physician dissatisfaction with EHR use. We propose that issues related to failed EHR achievement can be overcome by designing EHRs which support the cognitive work of clinicians. This premise is consistent with conclusions from the 2009 NRC report and two October 2009 AHRQ-funded reports calling for AHRQ to fund research on the relationships between clinician cognitive work and EHRs. This application takes up that challenge. Our long-term goal is to develop new EHR interfaces (data displays and input requirements), implementable by vendors and/or information technology programmers, that are demonstrated to support and extend clinician and team cognitive work to improve patient outcomes. This application takes the first step toward our long-term goal. Our Specific Aims are to (1) identify the cognitive work requirements of primary care clinicians and their clinical teams, and (2) develop and test specific EHR interface design requirements that support these cognitive work requirements. We choose to focus our research on primary care because of its high utilization, high complexity, and the current national efforts to redesign it following the patient-centered medical home model. Due to the cognitive complexity of primary care, we will employ a method designed to study cognitively complex work: cognitive task analysis (CTA). CTA methods are well-developed, and have been used to determine cognitive work requirements and develop information technologies that support this cognitive work in other complex domains such as aviation, nuclear power, NASA - and recently - healthcare. Using a specific CTA method called Goal-Directed Task Analysis, we will map the cognitive requirements of clinicians and clinician teams to EHR interface design. Our experienced research team comprised of experts in human factors engineering, health information technology, and primary care, has an 11-year history of collaboration and is uniquely positioned to complete this important endeavor. This application builds on the successes of our team's three recent AHRQ-funded primary care patient safety studies, and continues our productive partnership with Wisconsin's Practice-Based Research Network, to recruit clinics and clinicians."
"9547971","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Alcohol Use Disorder affects 7.9% of the U.S. population ages 18 and older and costs society over $223 billion per year in direct medical costs, accidents and lost productivity. Current pharmacotherapy is only modestly effective and has to be used in conjunction with psychosocial treatment. Primary care physicians are ill equipped to provide the currently necessary range of therapy for treating AUD and the modest effects of therapy generate a significant number of treatment failures. We have generated a novel molecule with action directly at one of the major neurotransmitter receptors altered by chronic excessive consumption of alcohol. We have also demonstrated in two different models of relapse drinking by alcohol dependent animals that our medication can reduce or prevent such relapse. Our preliminary studies on the safety and metabolism of our compound in animals provide confidence that the compound will have a good therapeutic index in human clinical trials. Prior to embarking on the trials in humans we, however, need for our drug to be approved for an IND by the Food and Drug Administration. To be able to accomplish this milestone we are proposing a series of SBIR Phase I, IND enabling studies, which include the development of an oral formulation which will be attractive for use with humans; the use of this formulation to repeat the relapse blocking effects of our compound in rats, and to extend our studies on reducing alcohol consumption with our compound to non- human primates. In these SBIR Phase I studies we will also establish the blood and brain levels of our drug after oral administration in the newly developed formulation. In the SBIR Phase II studies we will produce our drug under cGMP conditions and scale up production to meet future clinical trials. The Phase II SBIR studies will be fully focused on completing all of the FDA required studies for the IND, including complete studies of in vitro metabolism and metabolite identification, in vivo studies of Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, and Excretion, complete studies on safety and toxicology (including toxicokinetics) in two species (rats and monkeys). These studies will include escalating acute dose studies and sub-chronic and chronic studies of up to six months duration because we anticipate that human studies may include long term maintenance of patients on our medication. If an IND designation is obtained we anticipate launching a Phase I human safety trial with an arm of this study aimed at a clinical measure of craving in alcohol-dependent subjects. If this grant is funded and our medication reaches human trials we anticipate introducing a more efficacious and much more highly utilized medication to treat AUD."
"9446727","ABSTRACT On planet earth, organisms have evolved mechanisms to synchronize metabolic and physiological functions with the ~24 hour light/dark cycle. Interestingly, many human diseases have associations with the circadian day. When traveling across time zones, our sleep-wake patterns, mental alertness, eating habits and many other physiological processes temporarily suffer the consequences of being ?out of phase? until we adjust to the new time zone. In addition, a significant portion of the population works the ?graveyard? shift, including health care workers, police officers, truck drivers and factory workers. Recent studies have linked disruption of the circadian clock with numerous ailments, including: asthma, cancer, metabolic syndrome, cardiovascular diseases, psychiatric diseases, and learning disorders. Tremendous knowledge has come from studying the genetic and molecular basis of circadian rhythms in model organisms. Despite the importance of the circadian clock to all aspects of our physiology and behavior, the opportunity to probe the human circadian clock only became possible with the recognition of Mendelian circadian variants in people (familial advanced sleep-phase, FASP). We characterized FASP, collected many families, and mapped and cloned the first FASP genes. We went on to identify a total of 6 FASP genes and have generated animal models of all of them. Still, a large majority of FASP families do not have mutations in the known clock genes. In this proposal, we outline a plan to continue collecting additional families (Aim 1), to perform whole exome sequencing in probands from >50 ?unexplained? FASP families, and to sift among the variants to identify novel circadian rhythm/FASP genes/mutations (Aim 2). Finally, since the first 1-2 years will be focused on identifying novel FASP genes, we propose to perform in vitro and in vivo studies of a human FASP mutation in the TIMELESS gene (Aim 3). Parallel studies in humans and mouse models will synergize in dissecting understanding of FASP in humans and exploring the similarities and differences between our circadian clocks vs. those of other organisms. Studying the molecular mechanism of human circadian rhythmicity will have an enormous impact on our understanding of human health & disease. It should also lead to new strategies for pharmacological manipulation of the human clock to improve the treatment of jet-lag, various clock-related sleep and psychiatric disorders, as well as other human diseases. Understanding of the human clock genes and mutations will enable development of better therapies for ASPS of aging, jet lag, and other sleep disorders."
"9357368","Project Summary/Abstract The standard therapy for malignant primary bone tumors such as osteosarcoma and chondrosarcoma involves major surgeries. For tumors located in difficult regions such as the pelvis, surgical intervention could lead to serious side effects. These include loss of a limb and/or function, loss of bowel, bladder and sexual function as well as problems with wound healing and surgical complications. Therefore, exploring other approaches that can improve or complement current surgical techniques is important. Our long term goal is to find new ways to increase the efficacy of treatment for primary bone tumors. Radiation therapy is an excellent local control alternative but primary bone tumors are resistant except for Ewing?s sarcoma. Preliminary work in our laboratory shows that small molecule DNA repair inhibitors are effective at radiosensitizing primary bone tumor cells. Additionally, gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) are shown to enhance radiosensitivity by increasing the physical local dose of radiation inside tumors. While these separate observations are well known in the literature, there appears to be lack of studies that combine these two agents to investigate whether their combination leads to synergistic radiosensitization. Also, the underlying mechanism of how this strategy might work remains to be studied. Our central hypothesis is that combination of DNA repair inhibition and AuNPs provides synergistic sensitizing effects through independent mechanisms with AuNPs increasing levels of damage induction and DNA repair inhibitor preventing repair. In Aim 1, we will investigate the efficacy of combining a DNA repair inhibitor with AuNPs to radiosensitize primary bone tumors. We will perform both in vitro and in vivo studies to determine the effects of the combination therapy. In Aim 2, we will investigate the DNA damage response activated when combining radiation therapy with a DNA repair inhibitor and AuNPs. We will explore the levels of key effectors activated in response to the DNA damage caused by the combination therapy and examine downstream effects on DNA repair, cell cycle and apoptosis. The results of this study will pave the way for the treatment of primary bone tumors with radiation therapy. This will lead to a new approach that could complement surgery and improve survival and quality of life. Our finding could also lead to new scientific insight regarding the mechanism of action for a combination radiosensitization strategy that uses both a biological and physical approach."

A major component of our collaborative center will therefore be the transfer of genomics, bioinformatics and biostatistical knowledge to African scientists to promote and facilitate scientific projects in the region in collaboration with colleagues from the U.S. To accomplish this we have developed a series of educational workshops and graduate-level curricula to enhance African research capacity and foster cutting-edge genomics-based research and science careers, which complement our research efforts (Projects 1-3). The flagship educational enterprise of ACEGID is the annual summer genomics training program hosted by the Sabeti Lab at Harvard University and the Broad Institute. Our training program imparts specific skills related to utilizing genomics for the diagnosis of infectious disease and in-depth pathogen research in Africa. Previous work has placed us well positioned to expand our in-person training program to the H3Africa consortium as well as develop a robust, globally accessible, online training curriculum of practical genomics for diagnostics of infectious diseases. Towards this objective, we will enhance and expand our existing annual in-person genomics training for our collaborative center and H3Africa consortium students, enabling graduates to use these materials to conduct training courses in their home countries. During this project, we will also convert our training materials for wider distribution and online access by generating a massive open online course (MOOC) on practical training for genomics of infectious disease, and expand upon our existing outreach programme to disseminate research outcomes and new genomics information to the community. The Educational Core thus underpins our collaborative center?s overall aims, bridging vision and logistics to ensure the project?s success, and is the practical mechanism to transfer newly developed computational approaches, viral sequencing, and diagnostic technologies to African scientists."
"9482282","ABSTRACT: COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT AND DISSEMINATION CORE Adoption of research findings by individuals, providers, and communities is critical to improving health outcomes. However, passive diffusion of information, such as through publishing findings in scientific journals, is often ineffective in influencing practice. Active and targeted dissemination efforts, especially those that engage communities and other stakeholders, may have a greater impact. In our previous work, we engaged communities in a number of research and dissemination activities. Our Community Research Scholars Initiative increased the research capacity of community organizations. We taught 9 employees of community organizations about research methods and mentored them as they conducted research projects on topics relevant to their organizations. These organizations subsequently established a Community-Based Research Network to conduct collaborative research projects. The first collaborative project involves developing a community-academic partnership toolkit called BRACE (Building Research for Academic and Community Equity). We also established a practice-based research network of 65 northeast Ohio massage therapists and trained 32 community residents to be researchers in community-based participatory research projects. We now propose a conceptual framework-guided approach to disseminating information from the Center of Excellence?s research projects, pilot projects, and other activities. Dissemination will proceed through four phases: planning, packaging, distribution, and evaluation. The planning phase will create interactive dissemination activities that involve a two-way dialogue with stakeholders, not simply a one-way flow of information. The packaging phase will consider the language, format, accessibility, and appeal of dissemination material since these can influence utilization by target audiences. The distribution phase will determine which channels, or methods of communication, to use for distribution. These may include print material, internet-based approaches, mass media activities, and face-to-face interactions. Finally, the evaluation phase will evaluate the processes and outcomes of proposed engagement and dissemination activities. In addition, we will develop a strategic plan to translate our research findings into sustainable community and system-level changes. The proposed activities will be led by a dissemination workgroup consisting of researchers, community members, and other stakeholders. The Community Engagement and Dissemination Core will engage researchers, communities, and other stakeholders in efforts to disseminate research findings; will develop strategic planning processes to translate findings into sustainable changes; and will contribute to knowledge about best practices on disseminating health disparity research findings. !"

"9403498","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There  are  numerous  sporadic  developmental  brain  malformations  (DBM)  associated  with  intractable  epilepsy,  intellectual  disability,  and  autism.  Several  DBM  subtypes  such  as  focal  cortical  dysplasia (FCD), hemimegalencephaly (HME), and ganglioglioma (GG) are associated with enhanced  mTOR pathway signaling during brain development. Although aberrant mTOR activation can be caused  by gene mutations in upstream mTOR effectors, the etiology of mTOR activation in most DBM has not  been fully explained. To date, only a few genetic etiologies have been identified for small case numbers  of HME and GG. The majority of malformations especially FCDs result from unknown causes. Recently,  the  high-risk  human  papillomavirus  (type  16)  E6  oncoprotein  was  identified  as  a  potent  activator  of  mTOR signaling.  Recent data from our lab has demonstrated E6 protein in FCD type IIB. In the first  Aim, we will define the expression of HPV16 E6 oncoprotein in DBM brain specimens resected for the  treatment  of  intractable  epilepsy.  We  will  show  that  E6  labeled  cells  co-express  markers  of  mTOR  cascade  activation.  We  will  then  demonstrate  that  HPV16  E6  DNA  and  mRNA  are  detected  in  DBM  specimens by PCR, reverse transcriptase PCR, in situ hybridization, and single cell mRNA amplification  assays. In Aim 2, we will generate HPV pseudovirions containing E6 to assay the mechanism of viral  attachment  and  internalization  in  mouse  neural  progenitor  cells  as  well  as  effects  on  cell  size  and  mTOR signaling. In Aim 3, we will use in utero electroporation to introduce E6 into fetal mouse cortex  as a strategy to show that E6 can cause altered cortical development. These experiments will provide a  new  and  highly  relevant  etiology  for  DBM  associated  with  epilepsy.  These  experiments  would  demonstrate  for  the  first  time  HPV  infection  in  the  human  brain  and  would  thus  open  doors  to  many  new avenues for investigation."
"9354296","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Autism-associated genetic mutations produce altered learning abilities by perturbing the balance between stability and plasticity of synaptic connections in the brain. Such an imbalance may contribute to the rigid, restricted behavioral repertoire, insistence on sameness, and at times savant-like behavior seen in autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Motor dysfunction is a common and early symptom of ASD. Motor learning and with it the ability to form a new behavioral repertoire is essential for children with ASD in order to socially connect and communicate. These children often have a very restricted movement repertoire and require intensive therapy in order to improve and learn new motor skills. Methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MeCP2) is a transcriptional regulator that contributes to the  maintenance of neural circuit homeostasis through the activity-dependent modulation of gene expression and splicing. Its duplication causes MECP2-duplication syndrome, an 100% penetrant monogenic cause of autism, which leads to progressive intellectual disability, autism, motor dysfunction, spasticity, and epilepsy in males. Mice engineered to overexpress MeCP2 at twice normal levels exhibit a similar neurological phenotype. Remarkably, early in postnatal development these animals exhibit enhanced motor learning and memory (Collins et al., 2004), which over time progresses to motor dysfunction, spasticity and epilepsy. Such enhanced motor learning phenotype is shared across several models of autism, and is studied using rotarod training as a paradigm for consolidation of repetitive motor behaviors (Collins et al., 2004; Kwon et al., 2006; Nakatani et al., 2009; Rothwell et al., 2014). Here, we focus on primary motor cortex (area M1), which is known to contribute to motor learning. We will use chronic, in vivo, 2-photon imaging with the sensitive chronic calcium indicator GCaMP6s to follow dynamic patterns of neuronal activity elicited during locomotion in area M1. The study will start at the pr- symptomatic stage, will include a period of motor skill (rotarod) learning in which mutant animals perform better than littermate controls, and will terminate into the time period of motor regression. Tuning curves relative to the speed of locomotion, pairwise synchrony between different cell types (functional connectivity) and reliability of firing will be followed during otor skill learning and correlated with performance and motor skill acquisition memory. Mice with selective expression of the MECP2 duplication in pyramidal neurons versus inhibitory interneurons will be characterized behaviorally and studied. Specific aim 1: Study how MECP2-duplication (Tg1) mouse area M1 circuits change during motor learning at the pre-symptomatic stage. Specific aim 2: Follow how MECP2-duplication Tg1 area M1 circuit function changes from the pre-symptomatic to the post-symptomatic stage. We aim to forge a link between patterns of M1 circuit dysfunction and abnormal motor behavior in this model of the MECP2 duplication syndrome."

The CENC is a multi-center collaboration linking premier basic science, translational, and clinical neuroscience researchers from the Department of Defense, VA, academic universities, and private research institutes to effectively address the scientific, diagnostic, and therapeutic ramifications of mTBI and its long-term effects.  The Houston-based CENC Neuroimaging Core is comprised of an interdisciplinary team of neuroimaging experts from neuroradiology, neuropsychology, MR physics, information technology and computer programming, and statistics who facilitate sequence development and pulse programming, training and supervision of technologists, acquisition of imaging data, quality assurance, conventional and advanced imaging analysis, transfer and storage of imaging data, and assistance in interpreating neuroimaging data for existing and future Consortium projects. The Core is comprised of both VA- and academic-affiliate resources; an expansion of existing Core funds already granted to the academic affiliate (Baylor College of Medicine) is needed due to the Consortium's growth and the resulting change in the Core's scope of work. Specifically, expansion of the number of study sites for existing studies and the addition of several new projects has substantially increased the Core's responsibilities, including additional oversight, quality control, analysis, and administrative duties for Michael E. DeBakey VA Medical Center (MEDVAMC)-based Core investigators and staff. Project Objectives: Objectives of the Neuroimaging Core are to: 1) assist in the acquisition of brain imaging data, including conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), detailed volumetry and cortical thickness, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), arterial spin labeling (ASL), and resting state functional connectivity MRI (fcMRI); 2) transfer, convert, analyze, and store brain imaging data; 3) direct and assist in performing quality assurance of the scanners at all sites involved in imaging data collection; and 4) communicate with the investigators of projects involving imaging to facilitate integration of imaging data into the projects to address their aims. Project Methods: The collective expertise of the investigators in the Core facilitates utilization and analysis of several conventional and advanced imaging techniques. MEDVAMC-based Core personnel, including MR physicists, oversee quality assurance testing on each magnet, which is performed on a regular basis to ensure scanner accuracy, stability, and comparability. Core personnel assist in the pulse programming and sequence development for advanced MR sequences used in specific projects. Core investigators provide additional training to MR technologists and also to project coordinators on preparing participants to undergo imaging. Core personnel additionally provide assistance with computer programming to facilitate data sorting and analysis. Due to the complex nature of transferring and storing very large amounts of data as well as frequent software updates required by some imaging analysis programs, individuals with IT expertise are also involved. Core personnel also train and supervise all image analysts, assist in the interpretation of imaging data, and assist in manuscript preparation.                       "

"9396739","PROJECT SUMMARY Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a public health problem that increases the risk of cardiovascular disease and death. By promoting heart failure, cardiac hypertrophy is an important pathology in CKD and affects up to 90% of patients by the time they reach dialysis. Elevated serum levels of bone-derived fibroblast growth factor (FGF) 23 are a common, early metabolic complication of CKD that is strongly associated with cardiovascular events and mortality. In recent experimental studies, we demonstrated that in this context, FGF23 might act as a causal factor by directly targeting cardiac myocytes and inducing cardiac hypertrophy. We could show that FGF23 can specifically activate FGF receptor isoform 4 (FGFR4) and subsequent PLC?/calcineurin/NFAT signaling leading to hypertrophic growth of cardiac myocytes that occurs independently of elevations in blood pressure. Administration of an FGFR4-specific blocking antibody reduced cardiac hypertrophy in the 5/6 nephrectomy rat model of CKD, suggesting that pharmacological interference with myocardial FGF23/FGFR4 signaling might serve as a novel cardio-protective therapeutic approach in CKD. Here, we will study if active vitamin D (VitD) and soluble klotho (sKL), two endocrine factors with known cardio-protective functions and whose serum levels are significantly reduced in CKD, confer their anti-hypertrophic actions by blocking FGF23/FGFR4/PLC?/calcineurin/NFAT signaling in cardiac myocytes. This hypothesis is supported by our preliminary data showing that sKL and VitD block FGF23-induced hypertrophic growth of cultured cardiac myocytes. In Aim 1, we will determine if these inhibitory actions of sKL and VitD are associated with a reduction in FGF23-induced PLC? and NFAT activity. Our preliminary work indicates that VitD inhibits the FGFR4/PLC? interaction in FGF23-stimulated cardiac myocytes, and we will study if activated VitD receptor (VDR) can directly bind PLC? and/or FGFR4 to block PLC? activation post FGF23 treatment. Klotho is a transmembrane protein that binds to FGFRs and acts as co-receptor for FGF23 in the kidney. Here, we will determine if sKL can also interact with FGF23 and/or FGFR4 thereby blocking FGF23/FGFR4 binding and subsequent PLC?/calcineurin/NFAT signaling in cardiac myocytes. It has been shown that administration of VitD or sKL in rodent models of CKD reduces cardiac hypertrophy, and our preliminary data in 5/6 nephrectomized rats indicates that VitD inhibits myocardial calcineurin/NFAT activity. In Aim 2, we will determine if delivery of VitD or sKL can block FGFR4/PLC?/calcineurin/NFAT signaling in 5/6 nephrectomized rats and reduce cardiac hypertrophy. Furthermore, we will study if administration of VitD or sKL to an established genetic mouse model for cardiac hypertrophy induced by expression of a constitutively active FGFR4 mutant form, inhibits FGFR4/PLC?/calcineurin/NFAT signaling and improves cardiac morphology and function. We postulate that by interfering with FGF23-induced cardiac hypertrophy, administration of sKL and VitD might serve as a novel therapeutic strategy to tackle cardiac injury and death in patients with CKD."
"9402199","Oluwakemi Odukoya MBBS, MPH, FMCPH, a candidate for the Emerging Global Leader Award (K43), is an academic community health physician, with a strong professional interest in developing interventions to address lifestyle risk factors for non-communicable diseases in faith-based settings in Sub-Saharan Africa, with an initial focus on Nigeria. Dr. Odukoya?s research is focused on adapting research-tested interventions (generated in high income countries), to address physical activity and unhealthy eating in low and middle-income countries where the burden of ill health is greatest. She also seeks to develop and test the effect of introducing faith-based text messages to support the adapted intervention. She will use the K43 award to acquire new skills and structured learning experiences in order to launch a fully independent research career. The goals of this award are to: 1) Build on existing knowledge and acquire new knowledge and skills in Advanced Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Implementation science research, and Community-based participatory research techniques; 2) Continue to foster established mentoring relationships and skills transfer to acquire specific hands on skills to successfully conduct the pilot research project; 3) Use the opportunity afforded by the protected time and research training to design studies, analyze data and draft manuscripts for publications in high-impact journals from the ongoing research projects of her mentors, as well as her proposed K43 research; and 4) Develop and submit competitive research grant applications and ultimately launch into research independence in the design of research-tested interventions, directed at lifestyle risk factors for non-communicable diseases (NCDs) in low and middle income countries (LMICs).  These goals will be achieved under a complimentary group of experienced mentors. Professors Akin Osibogun (Nigeria-based) and Kola Okuyemi (USA-based) will serve as her primary mentors. They both have considerable expertise in mentoring early career investigators and in the development, adaptation and evaluation of community-based interventions for behavioral change. While Professor Sade Ogunsola (Nigeria-based and the current Provost at her home institution) will serve as secondary mentor. Prof Ogunsola was recently awarded a multi-year NIH research capacity building grant (1D43TW010134-01), and will provide specific mentoring on managing R01-level grants in LMICs, leadership and overcoming challenges unique to female faculty in LMICs.  The primary objective of the proposed study for this K43 award is to design and pilot-test a cultural adaptation of the effective components of two National Cancer Institute (NCI) research-tested church-based interventions i.e. Body and Soul and the Healthy Body Healthy Spirit to increase physical activity and healthy food consumption among Nigerians. The resulting intervention will thereafter, be known as Body Soul and Spirit (BSS). The secondary objective is to understand if, and how best, faith-based text messages may be used to improve the effect of this intervention. Body Soul and Spirit+Plus will be a combination of the BSS and the inclusion of an additional component, i.e. faith-based text messages (i.e. BSS+PLUS). This three-arm group- randomized controlled pilot trial of: BSS, BSS+PLUS and a control/usual care group, will be carried out among parishioners in 12 churches (4 in each group) in the diocese of Lagos Mainland of the Anglican Church of Nigeria. One hundred participants will be recruited in each group and be required to complete surveys at baseline, 3, & 6-month time points. Primary outcome measures include fruit and vegetable intake and the number of minutes spent on moderate to vigorous activities each week."
"9444922","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  We propose to explore a new mechanism of ionizing radiation detection for positron emission tomography (PET) using the modulation of optical properties instead of scintillation, with the ultimate goal to achieve less than 10 picosecond (ps) annihilation photon pair coincidence time resolution, which is an order of magnitude better than possible with state-of-the-art scintillation based PET detectors.  PET is a non-invasive imaging technology used every day throughout the world that enables visualization and quantification of the molecular signatures of disease in living subjects in the clinic as well as in biological research. A PET study comprises the collection of millions of annihilation photon pairs emitted from a positron-emitting radionuclide-labeled contrast agent injected into the patient. The two-photon hits are recorded by the system detectors and used to reconstruct a 3D image volume that represents the tracer biodistribution.  If successful, the proposed < 10 ps coincidence time resolution would represent a tremendous paradigm shift for PET as it would drastically change the way a PET system operates. The resulting remarkable time-of-flight (ToF) capability will bring substantial signal amplification over existing systems. The enormous image signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) boost can be exploited to greatly enhance lesion detection, for example, for lesions with low contrast-to-background ratio; significantly reduce both patient injected dose and patient scan duration, potentially opening new clinical and research roles for which PET currently has no involvement at all; or pave the way for completely new PET system designs with greatly improved spatial resolution.  In previous studies performed, we have shown that ionizing radiation can modulate optical properties, for example, the refractive index, of a detector material. We have found that the modulation signal amplitude is linearly dependent on both the event detection rate and average photon energy. In this project, we will work on further exploring mechanisms of optical property modulation to detect individual 511 keV photon interactions, and study the timing properties of this proposed detection concept with the goal to achieve < 10 ps coincidence time resolution. We first propose to achieve the detection of individual 511 keV photons using the mechanism of optical property modulation by developing novel methods to amplify the modulation signal and detection systems with significantly improved sensitivity. Then we plan to study the intrinsic timing properties of the optical property modulation process and explore methods to achieve < 10 ps coincidence time resolution for coincident 511 keV photon interactions. For the final aim, we will learn how to use this new mechanism of ionizing radiation detection to build a practical, ?tileable? ToF-PET detection element. This is an exciting multi-disciplinary project that borrows ideas from the field of modern optics with a goal of enabling substantial improvements in ToF-PET performance to drive important advances in the study and clinical management of disease."
"9269086","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Project Background/Rationale: Tinnitus is common among Veterans, particularly those with a history of traumatic brain injury (TBI), and can result in substantial cognitive, emotional, or slep disorders. Over 1.1 million VA-enrolled Veterans were service-connected for tinnitus in 2013. Tinnitus is a life-long condition for which there is no cure. However, our team has developed Progressive Tinnitus Management (PTM), a program designed to be delivered in-person or by telephone to teach Veterans (with and without TBI) methods for managing tinnitus symptoms. In randomized, controlled trials, clinic-based and telephone- based PTM led to clinically-significant reductions in tinnitus-related distress and dysfunction. Therefore, translation of evidence-based PTM into routine clinical practice is an imperative next-step. We are conducting research to understand barriers to PTM uptake across VA sites. Preliminary findings have shown that: 1) sites with comprehensive TBI services may be more prepared to implement PTM; but that, 2) all sites lack data supporting the need for, and interest in, PTM among Veterans with tinnitus. Project Aims: This project will address this gap by examining the epidemiology of clinically-significant tinnitus among Veterans in the VA system of care. Specifically, our aims are to: 1) Identify the proportion of Veterans with tinnitus in need of clinical services; 2) Examine Veterans' interests in PTM, either clinic- or telephone-based; and 3) Evaluate differences in Veterans' needs and interests by their TBI history. Project Methods: This two-year project will utilize a sequential mixed-methods study design. In Phase 1, we will conduct a survey of 1,200 randomly sampled Veterans identified with tinnitus and stratified by TBI history. Surveys will be mailed using a modified Dillman approach and will collect information on Veterans' tinnitus symptoms, severity, and dysfunction; interests in and perceptions of PTM; and overall health and functioning. In Phase 2, semi-structured telephone interviews will be conducted with a portion of survey respondents, purposively sampled based on response patterns to survey questions. Interviews will address Veterans' tinnitus symptoms and dysfunction; experiences with tinnitus-related healthcare; and interests in and perceived barriers to receiving PTM. Survey and interview data will be triangulated with VA administrative data to fully understand Veterans' needs for, and interests in, PTM services. Anticipated Impact: Tinnitus is an increasingly significant problem for Veterans, particularly those with a history of TBI. PTM is highly effective at reducing tinnitus-related dysfunction, but VA leaders and clinicians are in need of empirical data to support its implementation. Results of our research will directly address this need by generating contextualized (quantitative and qualitative) data on the number of Veterans in need of PTM services, their interests in receiving these services, and the personal experiences, attitudes, and beliefs that drive their expressed needs and interests."
"9521706","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Overall the Center for Biomedical OCT Research and Translation seeks to push the technological frontier of optical coherence tomography instrumentation and methods in response to challenges in biology and medicine. Fundamental to our approach, CBORT thrives on an intimate, push-pull relationship between physicists/engineers and biological, pre-clinical and clinical scientists. The most direct impact o the Resource will be to develop and provide broad access to powerful new tools for biological and clinical research. Facilitating rapid, high-resolution, high-contrast imaging through tailored,  application-specific instruments will accelerate and open new avenues of biomedical research. Results of this effort may include, for example, the identification of new methods for diagnosis, new insights into disease or disease progression, or the formulation of new therapeutic strategies or drug targets. Further, we anticipate that some of the resulting biological and clinicl research will identify new opportunities for commercialization of technology. By developing and making innovative and effective OCT technology available, we anticipate that there will be rapid progress and significant advances in each of these areas. Training and dissemination of OCT instruments and methods is another priority of CBORT. Regular symposia and workshops foster a broader communication within the field, provide access to results of research, and offer a hand-on experience with the construction, operation, and interpretation of data from state-of-the-art imaging systems. External users additionally have access to imaging systems within the Resource to conduct focused experiments or to generate preliminary data. CBORT can also place imaging systems off-site for clinical or pre-clinical pilot studies."
"9454707","Project Summary / Abstract Despite the central importance of neural circuit development to brain function and behavior, we lack the genetic information required to assemble a complete circuit. To address this knowledge gap we propose to develop novel synaptic and neuronal-neighborhood techniques to label a complete circuit in live animals. Using these tools we will genetically dissect a complete neural circuit for the first time, providing fundamental genetic insight into how circuits are built. We will take advantage of C. elegans biology - its available ultrastructural connectome and facile genetics, to address questions of synaptic wiring throughout a complete circuit. We will leverage the extensive genetic and anatomical knowledge of the C. elegans pharynx, a small but functionally independent circuit, as a model. We will for the first time create an expression map of all neurons in a circuit using neuron-specific FACS and transcriptomic profiling. We will then correlate these new gene expression maps to the ultrastructural connectome to reveal how patterns of gene expression correlate with connectivity. Next, we will construct fluorescent reporter systems to (1) label the entire pharyngeal circuit using GFP Reconstitution Across Synaptic Partners (GRASP) and (2) label the neighborhoods of adjacent neuronal processes using CD4-based in vivo Biotin Labeling of INtercellular Contacts (iBLINC). Using these tools, we will perform a genome-wide RNAi screen of cell surface proteins to determine their role in all major steps of circuit formation ? neuronal outgrowth, neighborhood, and synaptic choice. The results from this proposal will identify and validate genetic factors controlling wiring that can be further evaluated in complex vertebrate nervous systems and humans. This proposal will not only improve methodologies for fluorescent labeling of synapses and neuronal neighborhoods, but will provide an exquisitely detailed map-based understanding of a circuit in live animals. Furthermore, our approach and results will be useful in the broad context of understanding fundamentals of circuit formation applicable across brain complexity."
"9347615","Project Summary Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a leading cause of vision loss, affecting about 93 million people worldwide. A major breakthrough in DR therapy is the recent approval of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibitors. However, anti-VEGF therapy has limited efficacy with a number of side effects. The critical barrier is how to identify other angiogenic targets for alternative or combination therapy of anti-VEGF-resistant DR. We have discovered a novel DR-associated angiogenic factor that selectively binds to and stimulates angiogenesis of diseased but not normal vessels. In contrast, VEGF binds to and induces the angiogenesis of both diseased and normal vasculature. This new ligand has a different receptor pathway than VEGF, and therefore their inhibitors will have different spectra of anti-angiogenic activity for alternative or combination therapy of DR. We developed a monoclonal antibody against this new target and demonstrated its capacity to alleviate DR in mice with high efficacy. Based on the normal phenotype of the knockout mice, we predicted and confirmed that the therapeutic antibody at an excessively high dose has minimal side effects. Therefore, anti-angiogenic therapy against this new ligand has the advantages of high efficacy, minimal side effects and a different mechanism of action than anti-VEGF. Antibody humanization is an essential step for the translation of this novel therapy.  This project will humanize the monoclonal antibody (Aim 1). Humanized antibodies will be selected based on their ligand-binding affinity, neutralizing activity, therapeutic efficacy and side effects (Aim 2). Humanized antibody with optimal therapeutic activity and minimal side effects will be used for clinical trials in the next phase. Therefore, this project will lead to the development of a new drug for anti-angiogenic therapy of DR with high efficacy and safety."
"9444276","Project Summary/Abstract  Exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) is a non-invasive biomarker of airway inflammation, with applications in the clinical assessment of asthma and environmental epidemiology. Conventional FeNO?assessed at a flow rate of 50 ml/s (FeNO50)?is well-established, with international society guidelines for assessment and clinical interpretations. A promising but less well-established method of assessing FeNO is ?multiple flow NO analysis?, which uses FeNO measured at multiple flow rates to estimate ?NO parameters?, quantifying airway and alveolar sources of nitric oxide (NO), from deterministic physiological models of the lower respiratory tract. While these physiological models are quite well-developed in adults, the statistical methods for estimating their parameters are not, especially for children. Most researchers use estimation methods based on overly simplistic assumptions (e.g., a fixed airway size under a steady state) and linearizations of the resultant nonlinear models. These methods are easy to implement, but have poor statistical performance and do not account for the smaller airway size of children. These are major barriers to progress in this field.  For this project, we will develop a hierarchal Bayesian modeling approach implemented using Markov chain Monte Carlo based-methods. A key advantage of a Bayesian approach is the ability to incorporate outside data into the model, producing refined parameter estimates and, potentially, refining our understanding of airway inflammation. In particular, we plan to incorporate two types of outside information: measurements related to airway size, and data on potential determinants of inflammation, such as environmental exposures. By incorporating measured phenotype data explicitly into the estimation process, the resulting parameter estimates will better adjust for the impact of each individual?s unique physiology. Given the major changes that occur throughout adolescence, our expectation is that this adjustment will prove particularly useful when applying these models to children. This project has three specific aims: Aim 1. To develop methods to estimate NO parameters in a modified deterministic 2CM that personalizes the airway length for each participant (Aim 1a) and/or more realistic airway shapes (Aim 1b) within a hierarchical Bayesian framework for NO parameter estimation. Aim 2. To develop methods to estimate associations of potential determinants (e.g., environmental exposures) with NO parameters from the deterministic 2CM using a hierarchical Bayesian framework for cross-sectional (Aim 2a) and longitudinal multiple flow NO data (Aim 2b). Aim 3. To disseminate resultant software in an R package (Aim 3a) and a web application, running directly in a browser using a newly converted JavaScript numerical library (Aim 3b). The outcome of this work will be refined statistical methods for studying airway and alveolar NO in both environmental epidemiology and clinical settings for children and adults. The development of web-based software will increase the likelihood of widespread adoption of these methods."
"9554184","ABSTRACT  An interdisciplinary consortium of investigators from the Departments of Pharmacology and Ophthalmology at Case Western Reserve University, the Cleveland Louis Stokes VA Medical Center, the Cole Eye Institute at Cleveland Clinic Foundation, Washington University, Michigan State University, Johns Hopkins University and ingenious Targeting Laboratory, Inc., proposes to increase the pace at which basic science discoveries of disease mechanisms can be translated into therapies for complex visual system disorders and disease, a goal of the R24 National Eye Institute Translational Research Program on Therapy for Visual Disorders. This scientific partnership will employ its diverse expertise to evaluate potential therapies for retinal diseases in animal models by using a cutting-edge systems pharmacology paradigm. By screening a combination of G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) agonist/antagonist drugs (modulators) for their ability to prevent retinal pathology in animal models of various rod and cone photoreceptor cell retinopathies, we will identify suitable candidates for future testing in humans. High resolution imaging methods and transcriptional analysis among other approaches will be used to monitor the efficacy and safety of these combination therapies. The goals of this project are: Aim 1. Test in mice the efficacy of a combination of GPCR agonists/antagonists in protecting against light-induced retinal damage and with either spontaneous rapid or slowly-progressing cone degeneration. Aim 2. Pharmacologically and genetically validate the involvement and specificity of identified GPCRs and their precise subcellular localization using knockin mice with T4 lysosome (T4L) fused into their signaling domains and an antibody we developed against T4L. We also will use the FAST system that allows various genetic outcomes (from inactivation to overexpression) to be engineered in a single mouse model. Aim 3. Assess the effectiveness of GPCR therapy in a canine rod-cone retinopathy model. Aim 4. Expand the range of receptor modulators to include therapeutic antibodies. Fulfilling these interrelated aims will direct our development of more successful therapies for people with incurable blinding diseases."

"9325868","Project Summary Ischemic heart disease is the leading cause of death worldwide. To approach this major public health epidemic, two prevailing areas of study have emerged: 1) Cell therapy aimed at delivering culture-expanded pluripotent cells by coronary artery infusion after an ischemic event, and 2) Endogenous cardiac progenitor cells (CPCs) and their potential role for in vivo renewal and regeneration of the myocardium. Initially these two topics seemed inextricably linked, but it is now becoming clear that while delivery of CPCs for therapy may provide some mechanistically-unexplained benefit, the retention of these cells into the myocardium is marginal and de novo cardiomyocyte differentiation is even less common. A population of putative CPCs, marked by the tyrosine kinase receptor, c-Kit, have been a common focus in both areas of study. Our lab recently published a genetic lineage tracing model demonstrating the cardiac contribution of the Kit lineage in the heart which showed conclusively that Kit-derived cells rarely become cardiomyocytes, but have a high propensity for the formation of vascular endothelium. Furthermore, this study demonstrated that approximately 80% of Kit lineage-traced cardiomyocytes were actually derived from fusion events and the sought-after de novo cardiomyocyte was even more rare than originally believed. To validate this study, we aimed to eliminate the ability of Kit-derived cells to make any de novo cardiomyocytes by knocking out essential cardiomyogenic transcription factor, Gata4, theoretically allowing only for lineage-traced cardiomyocytes derived from fusion. Interestingly, the appearance of Kit lineage-traced cardiomyocytes due to fusion increased dramatically with the loss of Gata4 in the Kit lineage, and, furthermore, we observed a dramatic increase of both Kit-lineage cells in the heart and total cardiac vascular endothelium. We now hypothesize that what is uniting these findings is a novel role for Gata4 in the adult vascular endothelium, and what initially appeared to be an interesting driver of innate fusigenic character with cardiomyocytes is most likely an incidental readout due to increased vascular permeability and neoangiogenesis. While many GATA transcription factors have had previously reported roles in vascular development, including Gata4, few studies have focused on adult vascular homeostasis. Better understanding of this Gata4-mediated transcriptional control of vascular expansion could provide meaningful insight into mechanisms of cardiac renewal and repair. To address this novel role of Gata4 in the cardiac vascular endothelium, we will pursue the following aims: (1) Determine whether endothelial-specific loss of Gata4 leads to increased vascular permeability and enhanced angiogenesis; (2) Assess changes in cardiac recovery after deletion of Gata4 in the adult cardiac endothelium."

"9470216","Project Summary Whooping cough, caused by Bordetella pertussis, is one of the most contagious of all contagious diseases, and the least well controlled of all vaccine preventable pediatric diseases. Since switching to acellular pertussis (aP) vaccines, incidence in the US and other countries that made this vaccine substitution, have seen incidence rates rise. Epidemiologic and experimental data suggest that a key limitation of aP vaccines is that they do not block asymptomatic carriage and spread. However, the existence of an asymptomatic carrier state for B. pertussis has never been proven, but this is because the question has never before been asked in an appropriately designed, longitudinal, cohort study, with systematic sample and symptoms collection over time. In a previous birth cohort study, the Southern Africa Mother Infant Pertussis Study, we collected ~20,000 nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs from 2000 Zambian mother/infant pairs, from birth through 14 weeks of age, with symptoms catalogued in parallel. Preliminary analysis of this set suggests that pertussis is common among the infants. Moreover, nearly all of the mothers of the infected infants were also infected with pertussis, though few showed any symptoms. This is presumptive evidence of asymptomatic carriage, but rests only on analysis of about 10% of the total sample library. We contend that full analysis of this sample library could provide insight into the epidemiology and transmission patterns of B. pertussis in ways never before possible. Data from this proposed analysis of the library can answer fundamental questions about asymptomatic carriage, its frequency, and concurrence within the mother/infant pair, and will also be invaluable for updating mathematical models of pertussis transmission, allowing us to answer, for the first time, what proportion of overall pertussis transmission occurs via asymptomatic chains?"
"9485171","Abstract: Community Engagement and Dissemination Core The goal of our Community Engagement and Dissemination Core is to nurture and disseminate innovative research at the intersection of cognitive impairment, dementia, and Alzheimer's Disease within a Precision Medicine framework that informs personalized prevention, diagnosis, and treatment later in life. Two distinct, but related strategies characterize our approach to achieving this goal. The first strategy strengthens current collaborations and establishes new ones with Native patient advocacy groups, tribal communities and their leaders, providers and administrators in the Indian Health Service, tribal, and urban Indian health care system (I/T/U), policymakers in American Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN) health, and with other research intensive universities. The second strategy recognizes that health research benefits patients and communities only if scientists and health professionals use effective ways to communicate new findings across community settings and into clinical practices. Our work will proceed using both innovative and traditional channels to disseminate information and interventions that inform more precise approaches to preventing, diagnosing, and treating cognitive impairment, dementia, and Alzheimer's Disease throughout AI/AN communities. Accordingly, the specific aims are to: 1) reconfigure and expand collaborations with research partners across private, tribal, and public constituencies to include an empirically driven focus on cognitive impairment, dementia, and Alzheimer's Disease within a Precision Medicine framework; 2) develop a multi-level, multi-sector, empirically driven infrastructure and related processes that ensure inclusion of local, regional, as well as national priorities for and approaches to a Precision Medicine research agenda specific to this agenda among older AI/ANs; 3) disseminate the results of Center Research Projects and Pilot Projects to the scientific community to encourage new research collaborations between AI/AN communities and researchers; and 4) disseminate the results of Center Research Projects and Pilot Projects to the communities of health professionals providing care for AI/AN patients and communities by using modern methods of implementation science to affect practice change. The Community Engagement and Dissemination Core will be led by Denise Dillard, PhD (Inupiat), Southcentral Foundation, and Meghan Jernigan, MPH, Partners for Native Health, Washington State University. They will be responsible for planning, coordinating, and implementing Core activities, including budget preparation, oversight of personnel appointments, space allocation, and other aspects of program management and operation. Supported by the Administrative Core, these activities will be carried out in concert with the Drs. Manson and Nelson, RP directors, and the Center Executive Committee. Culturally tailored engagement and dissemination will play a critical role in the adoption of more precise approaches to preventing, detecting, and treating cognitive impairment, dementia and Alzheimer's Disease among AI/ANs. Our 40 years at work in Native communities significantly enhances our ability to disseminate new knowledge and approaches to ameliorating such problems in this special population."
"9513187","ABSTRACT Epilepsy remains a devastating and poorly understood illness whose therapies are inadequate for many patients and, in large degree, unchanged for decades. The experiments proposed in this project utilize novel microelectrode recording techniques in patients with epilepsy as well as quantitative features and large data sets to obtain information about the neuronal dynamics underlying epilepsy at an unprecedented level of resolution. The primary hypothesis of this project is that this high resolution, multi-scale information can be applied to separate seizures into different classes which differ in the mechanisms which underlie seizure initiation. More specifically, we will be examining the role and interplay of widespread networks, different cortical layers, infraslow activity and both excitatory and inhibitory single neuronal activity as seizures start. We expect to find substantial differences in these different features of neural action in different kinds of seizures. This knowledge will foster the development of a more complete understanding of seizures and how they can be better detected, predicted and ultimately controlled."
"9479456","International Conference on Health Policy Statistics (ICHPS) 2018  Specific Aims  The 12th International Conference on Health Policy Statistics (ICHPS), under the timely theme, ?Health <-> Statistical Science <-> Care, Policy, Outcomes?, focuses on the interactive relationship between health services research and innovative statistical methodology. It falls within the category of ?Research Design and Methodology? in the AHRQ program announcement. The primary sponsor is the Section on Health Policy Statistics of the American Statistical Association (ASA). The 12th ICHPS will be held January 10 to 12, 2018 in Charleston, South Carolina. Details for the last ICHPS conducted in 2015 attended by 246 participants, are available online at: http://www.amstat.org/meetings/ichps/2015/index.cfm.  The overarching aim of ICHPS is to create an educational and research forum for statisticians, econometricians, and other research methodologists working on cutting-edge and innovative approaches to exchange and to build upon ideas, and to foster the tradition of linking methodologists with policymakers and other stakeholders in the health services research and health policy arenas to add focus and perspective to the development of new methodological tools. Additional aims of ICHPS 2018 are to increase participation by students and junior investigators, as well as to increase local engagement.  The technical program for the upcoming ICHPS will examine a broad range of topics that fit very well with the goals of the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), consistent with previous ICHPS conferences supported by AHRQ. The invited sessions will be useful to promote improvements in the quality, safety, efficiency, and effectiveness of health care by developing, debating and disseminating state-of-the-art research methods. In line with ASA's increasing efforts to engage policy-makers and other stakeholders in health policy, ICHPS 2018 will focus on data-centric statistical methodology related to health services research, and health policy issues of national and international importance.  The invited program includes invited sessions, workshops, contributed talks and posters, in addition to a keynote and a plenary speaker. The confirmed keynote speaker is national expert Dr. Robert Califf, Professor of Medicine at Duke University and former Commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration. The confirmed plenary speaker is Dr. Suchi Saria, Assistant Professor, Department of Computer Science, Johns Hopkins University, a machine learning expert working on the use of data-driven technology to improve healthcare. Sessions will cover key methodological areas including: causal inference, health disparities research, propensity scores, analysis of complex survey data, heterogeneous treatment effects and individualized treatments, longitudinal modeling, meta-analysis and evidence synthesis, novel trial designs, real-world data, and patient-reported outcomes. Most importantly, the ICHPS program is focused on addressing key health care policy research priorities. Applied topics that have been focal points at recent ICHPS meetings on comparative effectiveness research include examining evidence-based care, patient-reported outcomes analyses, and personalized medicine.  The program will also include roundtable discussions to provide research training and career development for new and current health policy and health services researchers in methods, resources and applications at the forefront of health policy research.

"9488105","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Health literacy is a critically important skill that helps people to become active participants in their health care. The 2003 National Assessment of Adult Literacy showed that more than 75 million Americans had basic health literacy skills, indicating that as many as 1 in 4 Americans can have difficulty understanding information about their healthcare. Persons in racial and ethnic minorities are likely to have even lower levels of health literacy. Twenty-four percent of blacks (9.5 million persons) and 41% of Hispanics (21 million persons) have below basic levels of health literacy. These persons have lower levels of health literacy and compelling evidence, including our own findings (see below), link race and ethnicity to disparities in health via health literacy. Members of minority groups and older adults are more frequently affected by chronic diseases such as cancer, high blood pressure, heart attack, stroke, diabetes, elevated cholesterol, asthma, hepatitis C, HIV infection, mental health disorders and many others. The twin burdens of chronic disease and low levels of health literacy thus fall disproportionately on those most in need - members of minorities and older adults, all of whom likely to experience one or more chronic conditions while often not having the health literacy skills to help them cope. Chronic disease self-management (CDSM) is a logical target for a general health literacy intervention. In an approach that cuts across specific diseases. CDSM targets problems and skills needed to cope with issues such as fatigue, pain, stress, depression, sleep disturbance and treatment adherence. Studies show that in- person CDSM classes improve patients' functioning and reduce healthcare utilization, but their availability is limited due to the lack of qualified personnel and cost. Similarly, while interventions have been developed to improve health literacy, they are difficult to scale to levels needed to meet the challenge of low health literacy (for more than 40 million persons) due to their cost. Effective interventions with the potential for wider dissemination at reasonable costs are urgently needed. In a previous study, we showed that a computer-delivered tailored information intervention targeting health literacy that can deployed either as an information kiosk in a clinical office or n the Internet could be cost- effective in improving patients' health literacy and adherence. It is nt clear, however, whether the same sort of computer-delivered, multimedia and interactive approach will be effective in improving CDSM skills in persons with low baseline levels of health literacy, and if it is, whether its effects will extend beyond health literacy to general health, slf-efficacy, activation, and treatment adherence. In this follow-up study we will evaluate this possibility by creating a personally relevant computer-delivered intervention targeting CDSM and health literacy among African-Americans, Hispanics, and white non-Hispanics:"
"9573574","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):        Diabetes is one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in the veteran population. A failure to increase the ?-cell proliferation and functional ?-cell mass in response to increasing metabolic demand from insulin resistance associated with obesity and aging underlies most causes of adult onset diabetes in veterans. It is, therefore, imperative to better understand the regulation of ?-cell proliferation, so that it may be targeted for therapeutic purposes to cure diabetes. While Tead1, a critical transcriptional effector of the mammalian Hippo pathway, has been shown to increase cellular proliferation in many tissues, its role in ?-cell proliferation is unknown. In preliminary studies, we demonstrate that Tead1 is robustly expressed in mouse and human islets and has a non-redundant role in regulating ?-cell proliferation. While Yap and Taz, co-activators of Tead1, translocate to the nucleus in hyperplastic islets, ?-cell specific Tead1 deletion leads to diabetes and glucose intolerance, secondary to a loss of glucose stimulated insulin secretion in vivo. Tead1-null islets display a decrease in expression of mature ?-cell markers and a surprising increase in ?-cell proliferation. This increase in ?-cell proliferation occurs even in ?-cells of aged mice that are normally quiescent in controls. Global transcriptome analysis from Tead1-null islets reveals a significant differential expression of genes that regulate cell cycle with a significant decrease in expression of p16 (Ink4a/Cdkn2a), a critical cell cycle inhibitor. Tead1 also binds directly to the promoter of p16, suggesting it may e a direct transcriptional target of Tead1 in ?- cells and mediates the Tead1 regulation of cell cycle. In addition, Tead1 also occupies the cis-promoter elements of critical ?-cell genes, including Pdx1, MafA and Nkx6.1, while the expression of these genes is decreased in Tead1-null islets, suggesting that Tead1 may directly regulate ?-cell function. Hence, we hypothesize that Tead1 regulates the switch between quiescence and proliferation and in maintaining the mature ?-cell phenotype to exert critical control of ?-cell functional mass. The broad goal is to delineate key pathways regulating ?-cell proliferation through genetic loss- and gain-of-function studies using in vivo mouse models and ex vivo mouse and human islets. We will specifically 1. Test if Tead1 regulates adult ?-cell proliferation and quiescence and dissect underlying mechanisms by assessing if Tead1 regulates aging-associated quiescence and decline in ?-cell proliferation and dissect underlying mechanisms. We will test our hypothesis that p16 is a direct target of Tead1 mediating the age-associated proliferative senescence in ?-cells. 2. Test if Tead1 is required for ?-cell function and identify its molecular targets in ?-cells by assessing changes in Tead1-deficient ?-cells in genes regulating function, such as Pdx1, MafA and Nkx6.1, along with identification of direct transcriptional targets of Tead1 that regulate ?-cell function. We will also test if de-differentiation plays a role in the loss of ?-cell function with Tead1 deletion. We will test if Tead1 co-activators, Yap/Taz and its co-repressor, Vgll4, regulate ?-cell proliferation and function. 3. Determine the role of Tead1 and the mammalian Hippo pathway in human islet proliferation and function by assessing if Tead1 regulates ?-cell proliferation in isolated human islets and if this regulatory role is impaired in diabetes. Collectively the proposed studies will critically address how Tead1 regulates ?-cell proliferation and identify novel pathways regulating cell cycle in ?-cells. We envision that the results from ths study will lead to discovery of targeted therapies to modulate ?-cell proliferation to preserve an restore functional ?-cell mass in combating diabetes. With the significant rise in incidence of diabetes in veterans, there is an urgent need to develop novel therapies to reverse the decline in functional ?-cell mass and successful completion of the proposed experiments will address this critical need."
"9420189","Organophosphorus (OP) nerve agents are classified as neurotoxins as they serve as potent inhibitors of acetylcholinesterase (AChE). Inhibition of AChE leads to toxic accumulation of acetylcholine in the synapse and neuromuscular junctions, resulting in hyper-stimulation of these pathways. OP nerve agents represent a significant threat and thus, there is an urgent need to develop therapeutic treatments for those exposed or poisoned by OPs. Phosphotriesterase (PTE) hydrolyzes a broad range of substrates including OPs. However, its activity varies considerably from substrate to substrate and possesses a short half-life, in vitro. Recently, we developed a fluorinated PTE variant via computational methods that exhibits superior stability and half-life. Our long-term goal is to develop robust, PTE-based therapeutics for treatment of V-agent (an OP nerve agent) exposure. Our central hypothesis is that combining non-canonical amino acid (NCAA) incorporation into PTE for increased stability with Rosetta-based computational design can lead to the development of highly stable and active fluorinated PTE variants for VX, VR and VM. Our rationale is that once we identify fluorinated PTE variants active for V-agents, they can be tested in vivo for therapeutic efficacy as a novel treatment for OP exposure. Our specific aims focus on employing Rosetta to design fluorinated PTE variants for enhanced hydrolysis of VX, VR, and VM with improved half-life and stability (aim 1) and learning from experimental results to design and investigate a second generation set of fluorinated PTE2 variants with improved function for the V agents (aim 2). The proposed studies will have an important translational impact on therapeutic interventions for OP poisoning, specifically those exposed to V agents. Our combined biosynthetic and computational approaches for NCAA-bearing enzymes are expected to advance the design of therapeutic enzymes and treatment of exposure."
"9348624","Project Summary  About 6.3% of the US population (ages 12+) have misused prescription (Rx) drugs in the past year, with this prevalence almost double among young adults ages 18-25. Unintentional poisoning deaths involving opioid pain relievers (Rx drugs most likely to be abused) have more than quadrupled from 1999-2010, and now outnumber deaths from heroin and cocaine combined. Deaths related to Rx drug poisoning surpassed motor vehicle crashes as the leading cause of injury-related mortality in 2009. The increase in the use of opioid pain relievers is due in part to the liberalization of laws governing the prescription of opioid analgesics for chronic pain, the introduction of new and more aggressive pain management standards, and the availability of new drugs. This project will estimate the effects of key state initiatives targeting Rx drug abuse. These include mandatory prescription drug monitoring programs (PDMP), an ID requirement at the dispensing stage, and required physical exam of the patient prior to prescribing. For most states participation by prescribers and dispensers in the PDMP is voluntary, and hence PDMP utilization rates are quite low and well below 50%. Furthermore, there is very limited research on the effects of these policies despite recommendations by the Obama administration and many state health departments to institute these programs. In addition to addressing this knowledge gap, this project will also assess whether these policies have had unintended consequences in terms of raising heroin use, which has more than doubled among young adults over the past 5 years. Among illicit drug users, Rx abuse is second in prevalence only to marijuana, and 1 out of 4 new illicit drug users began their habit with non-medical use of Rx drugs. Thus, unintended consequences in the form of greater use of heroin or other illicit drugs may occur as availability of Rx drugs is reduced by state programs. Alternatively, positive spillovers are also possible if the number of individuals who acquire an opioid addiction and consequently transition to heroin or other illicit drugs is reduced. Five complementary data sets will be utilized to investigate these policy effects across a range of self-reported and objectively measured Rx and illicit drug-use and drug-related health outcomes. Considerable variation in the adoption of these initiatives across and within states, including staggered adoption of different policies within the same state, will be exploited within a difference-in-differences (DD) research design to identify credible causal effects. The models will be supplemented with various checks and sensitivity analyses, including testing and adjusting for the assumptions underlying the DD estimation, assessing reinforcement effects across the policies, assessing cumulative effects, assessing cross-border spillovers, and assessing heterogeneous policy responses. The proposed research will provide the most comprehensive study to date of the effectiveness and possible unintended consequences of key state initiatives aimed at curbing Rx drug diversion. These estimates will yield valuable evidence informing policymakers on the mix of regulations effective in reducing Rx abuse."
"9276354","Abstract  This MIRA application combines three NIGMS awards R01GM070837, 1R01GM110639, and 5R01GM108487, studying the tethering and integration the murine leukemia virus (MLV) preintegrative complex (PIC). Gammaretroviruses require cells to undergo mitosis for integration and preferentially integrate within active promoters regions, proximal to transcriptional start sites (TSS) and CpG islands. The requirement for mitosis limits the use of these vectors to dividing cells. The site of integration is linked to the oncogenic potential of the virus and thus its pathogenesis and use as a gene delivery vector.  Studies are focused on three targeted areas. The p12 protein is required for tethering the PIC to mitotic chromosomes. Recent analysis of MLV p12 tethering properties has revealed a novel mechanism of suppression of tethering localizing in the N-terminus of the p12 protein. A model is proposed that incorporates an orientation reversal from the precursor Gag protein to that found in the PIC that transitions through an intermediate in which the tethering domain is inhibited by N- and C-terminal charge interactions. Experiment testing this model will involve biochemical and structural approaches, including NMR analysis of the p12 tethering domain.  Our collaborative research has identified the host BET family of proteins, specifically the Brd 2,3, and 4 proteins as interactors with the MLV IN. The interaction between the MLV IN C- terminal tail peptide and the ET domain influences the integration into TSS and CpG islands. Studies proposed build on this newly defined viral-host interaction. Building on the solution structure of the MLV IN CTD from our laboratory, experiments are aimed at defining the structural data of larger complexes including the MLV IN CTD:Brd3 ET complex, and the domains of IN bound to DNA. The ability of the MLV IN protein to compete with known ET domain interactors will be studied. Next-generation sequencing and bioinformatics will be used to probe a panel of IN proteins for their target-site preferences, both locally at the site of integration as well as globally within the human genome. The recognition of the target DNA within the nucleosome structure is examined.  These studies will be combined with two emerging areas in our laboratory. The first develops MLV based virus-like particles (VLP) for the delivery of proteins, rather than genes into cells. The second area of research develops a modified Env system that allows entry through scFvs and monobodies as targeting moieties. This system could be generalized and expanded to address a wide range of applications and diseases."
"9316333","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project will develop and evaluate a glaucoma screening program for high-risk African American and Latino men and women 50 years of age and older, and will provide a refined screening algorithm with acceptable positive and negative predictive values that can be generalized to other high-risk populations. We are collaborating with highly successful local community organizations with extensive experience in screening for disease and obtaining care for these at-risk populations. Our partners work closely with others in the community including churches, community health centers, and community clinics. Our approach is innovating in ways that will overcome obstacles to screening, referral and retention that have limited previous community- based glaucoma screening programs. Specifically, we will achieve our objectives in two phases. In the first phase (up to 18 months involving 1,000 participants), we will adapt our planned streamlined diagnostic algorithm to maximize positive and negative predictive values for glaucoma. Additionally, we will seek out low-cost approaches and will leverage technology to reduce the overall cost of the process so that the program used can be brought to scale in other regions of the United States. Throughout the program we will use multiple structural and functional visual tests (tests of visual acuity, fundus photographs, intraocular pressure measurements, and visual field testing) with on- site and centralized reading and interpretation of images. Data from the initial screening efforts will be used to improve our screening algorithm. In the second phase, we will apply the final simplified algorithm to a series of high-yield screening venues for African American and Latino adults 50 years of age and older via participation in events organized by local community associations (N = 9,000 participants). While glaucoma will be the primary aim of screening, other eye conditions (refractive error, cataract and diabetic retinopathy) will also be identified and referred. Given high rates of glaucoma in first-degree relatives, we will embed a program to pursue relatives of identified cases. We will also leverage internet and cell-phone based technologies to develop, implement, and evaluate strategies for monitoring follow-up care of screened participants. In summary, this program will not only screen a large number of individuals without access to eye care and at risk of blindness, it will also, through ongoing data collection at every stage of the process, create a scalable model for reaching these individuals across the country."
"9398913","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):      Free radical-induced damage makes an important contribution to secondary neuronal injury in stroke. No therapy exists at present to prevent or alleviate these effects. The use of catalytic degradation of free radicals is a promising therapeutic approach to address the secondary damage in CNS. Antioxidant enzymes and their low molecular weight mimetics have recently been proposed as potentially powerful therapeutic agents for reducing free radical-induced injury in stroke, and have been shown to be efficient in a number of animal models. However, therapeutic use of these agents for treatment of stroke is limited due to their inability to efficiently penetrate blood-brain barrier. Recently, ability of several targeted nanoparticulate an liposomal constructs to penetrate the blood-brain barrier has been demonstrated. Here, we propose to achieve targeted delivery of a SOD mimetic AEOL 10150 to the site of CNS injury using antibody-coated nanoparticles (NPs) and liposomes. Targeting will be achieved through conjugation of anti-NR1 receptor antibody, which was found to specifically target injured brain parenchyma in our preliminary studies. Our working hypothesis is that enhanced delivery of targeted antioxidant NPs to the site of injury can reduce free radical damage and reduce the degree of secondary neuronal damage in stroke. The strategic goal of this study is to develop a medication for intravenous administration, which could be used as neuroprotective treatment to reduce free radical mediated secondary neuronal damage in stroke. To accomplish this goal, we will first prepare optimized targeted conjugates with maximized binding ability. Experiments with rat cortical neuronal cultures will then be used to evaluate safety and efficacy in vitro, and estimate dosage ranges for animal experiments. Finally, a mouse stroke model will be used for the in vivo evaluation of the efficacy of the proposed therapeutic approach. The short-term goal of this project is to collect in vivo data necessary for translation to a large animal model. In th long term, this research will lead to the development of a novel therapy for treatment/prophylactics of secondary neuronal injury in stroke. More broadly, results of this research will have implications in development new targeting approaches for treatment of various CNS conditions including traumatic brain injury and spinal cord injury."
"9565315","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Senescent cells (SCs) have emerged as a potential therapeutic target for aging and age-related diseases. Senolytic agents, small molecules that can selectively kill SCs, have the potential to be developed as ?anti- aging? drugs that can extend human healthspan (years of life without disability or other impairment) by preventing or treating age-related diseases. Recently, we reported the discovery of ABT-263 (navitoclax) as a potent and selective senolytic agent through screening of a library of rationally selected compounds. Our studies show that ABT-263 functionally rejuvenates hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) in both sublethally irradiated (6 Gy) and naturally aged mice by depleting SCs, including senescent HSCs, thus demonstrating the therapeutic potential of senolytic agents. Following the same approach, we have identified a second senolytic agent, piperlongumine (PL), a natural dietary product isolated from a variety of Piper (pepper) species. Unlike ABT-263, which induces SC apoptosis by inhibiting Bcl-2 proteins, the underlying molecular mechanisms of action (MMOA) of PL in inducing SC death are undefined, raising the potential of discovering novel molecular targets for senolytic drug development. Therefore, we hypothesize that PL can serve as a promising lead for the development of novel senolytic agents and can be used to identify molecular targets that are important for SC survival. The objectives of this application are to discover and evaluate PL analogues (?piperlogues?) as potent and selective senolytic agents, identify their molecular targets, and elucidate the MMOA of these novel agents. These objectives will be accomplished by carrying out the following specific aims: 1) design, synthesize and evaluate novel piperlogues to improve the senolytic activity of PL; 2) identify and validate the protein targets of PL and piperlogues in SCs, and elucidate their MMOA; and 3) evaluate the in vivo efficacy of lead piperlogues. Success in these proposed aims will not only produce PL-based anti-aging drug development candidates but also identify and validate novel molecular target(s) to enable future design and target-based discovery of novel senolytic agents and to gain more insights into the biology of cellular senescence and the MMOA of PL and piperlogues."
"9350455","Summary: Atherosclerosis is the primary cause of cardiovascular disease (CVD), one of the most critical causes of mortality in America. The current standard of care for at-risk patients involves dietary and lifestyle changes along with administration of statin drugs to lower blood cholesterol levels. However, a substantial residual risk of disease progression remains for patients treated with these conventional preventative and therapeutic options. Therapeutic strategies raising plasma high-density lipoprotein (HDL) levels failed to demonstrate reduced cardiovascular events in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD). Recent studies have provided insight into the possible mechanisms by which compositional alterations of HDL in patients with CAD leads to the functional heterogeneity. This continuous remodeling generates a heterogeneous population of circulating HDL, which can have distinct effects on endothelium. Due to the overwhelming number of HDL component combinations, the mechanisms of the altered effects on endothelial function remain poorly understood. Moreover, recent genetic studies suggest that bare measurements of plasma HDL levels are insufficient to accurately capture the functional variations caused by dynamic remodeling of HDL compositions. Furthermore, the inability of conventional experimental models to create a disease relevant state underscores the development of an in vitro model that reconstitutes pathophysiological conditions of vascular ECs in atherosclerosis. We propose to comprehensively investigate the endothelial effects of a wide-ranging library of engineered HDL-based nanoparticles (eHNPs) with representative functional proteins in pathophysiologically relevant microenvironments. We will create a novel in vitro surrogate model that replicates the structural and functional complexity of the human coronary artery and study the heterogeneous endothelial effects of various eHNPs for the treatment of atherosclerosis. We are particularly interested to determine if our approach uncovers new relationships between compositional and functional alteration of eHNPs, whether the heterogeneous endothelial effects of eHNPs are affected by disturbed flow in atherosclerosis, and whether ?healthy? eHNPs exhibit therapeutic potentials outperforming ?dysfunctional? eHNPs. This proposed work represents a risky expedition into new scientific territory in that it seeks to develop a new paradigm for studies on the functional heterogeneity of circulating HDL using innovative nanotechnology, microfluidics, and bioengineering approaches to develop an in vitro model of the human coronary artery. Therefore, the proposed work is uniquely suited to the New Innovator Award program rather than traditional grant mechanisms. The successful outcomes will provide a better understanding of the mechanisms leading to altered endothelial effects of HDL, improve the outcomes of the clinical studies by determining effects of alterations in the HDL proteome, and potentially lead to novel therapeutic measures capable of preventing the progression of atherosclerosis."
"9470057","Project Summary/Abstract  Drugs of abuse are known to cause long-term changes in the synaptic plasticity of reward circuitry and, ultimately, persistent changes in behavior. Understanding the mechanisms underlying these changes is a key open question. As the reward circuitry and the learning and memory circuitry share key nodal points, new discoveries in the learning and memory field will have the potential to shed light on aspects of drug-seeking behavior. In particular, it is well established that gene expression is required for long-lasting forms of synaptic plasticity and long-term memory formation. Very recently, studies demonstrated that epigenetic regulation of gene expression during memory consolidation can modulate gene expression dynamics, resulting in surprising effects on memory formation. For example, inhibition or deletion of histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3) in the nucleus accumbens leads to maintained expression of Nr4a2 (nuclear orphan receptor 2), correlating with cocaine- context associated memory formation. Nr4a2 is a transcription factor for tyrosine hydroxylase and the dopamine transporter, defining enzymes of dopaminergic signaling. The medial habenula (MHb), a region that highly expresses both HDAC3 and NR4A2, and its projections have recently been identified as main targets of drugs of abuse. I have already demonstrated that the MHb is engaged by cocaine-primed reinstatement of CPP and activation of the MHb induces a reinstatetement-like phenotype (Specific Aim 1). The F99 phase of this proposal will test whether Nr4a2 within the MHb is a key regulator of cocaine-primed reinstatement (Specific Aim 2.1). It will test whether epigenetic alterations induced by drugs of abuse lead to misregulation of Nr4a2 within the MHb (Specific Aim 2.2). Lastly, using a ChIP-seq approach, it will seek to identify alterations in Nr4a2 function that engage the reinstatement of drug-associated behavior (Specific Aim 2.2).  The proposed project will also help the candidate, Mr. Alberto López, achieve his career goal of becoming an independent investigator at a research-focused institution. This project provides training in cutting-edge research skill, including FACS, ChIP-qPCR, and viral vectors to manipulate gene expression. Further, the proposed studies will provide professional and technical training to prepare the candidate to successfully transition to a postdoctoral position (K00) in a laboratory that studies the neural-circuitry driving drug-seeking behavior. The University of California, Irvine is an ideal environment for training towards achieving these goals. UCI is a university with 1) an intellectual environment that encourages cooperation and collaboration, 2) technical resources to perform cutting-edge research, and 3) renowned faculty that encourage pedagogical training, mentorship, and development of other necessary professional skills. The complete plan proposed here for both the F99 and K00 phases has been designed to develop an independent neurobiologist prepared for a transition to a successful postdoctoral position and, ultimately, independent tenured investigator."
"9394127","The purpose of this proposal is to develop a combination of innovative statistical and data visualization approaches using patient-generated health data, including mobile health (mHealth) data from wearable devices and smartphones, and patient-reported outcomes, to improve outcomes for patients with Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (IBDs). This research will offer new insights into how to process and transform patient-generated health data into precise lifestyle recommendations to help achieve remission of symptoms. The specific aims of this research are: 1) To develop new preprocessing methods for publicly available, heterogeneous, time-varied mHealth data to develop a high quality mHealth dataset; 2) To develop and apply novel machine learning methods to obtain accurate predictions and formal statistical inference for the influence of lifestyle features on disease activity in IBDs; and 3) To design and develop innovative, interactive data visualization tools for knowledge discovery. The methods developed in the areas of preprocessing of mHealth data, calibration for mHealth devices, machine learning, and interactive data visualization will be broadly applicable to other mHealth data, chronic conditions beyond IBDs, and other fields in which the data streams are highly variable, intermittent, and periodic. This work is highly relevant to the mission of the NIH BD2K initiative which supports the development of innovative and transformative approaches and tools to accelerate the integration of Big Data and data science into biomedical research. This project will also enhance training in the development and use of methods for biomedical Big Data science and mentor the next generation of multidisciplinary scientists."
"9517521","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The University of California Preclinical Animal Study Site (UC PASS) is a collaborative effort between UC Davis and UC San Diego that brings together the scientific expertise, state of the art technologies and facilities, and institutional support to achieve the primary objectives goals of the PASS, which are to: 1) develop animal models that best complement the endurance and resistance training protocols used in the human trials, and 2) provide organ and tissue samples collected at multiple time points after both acute and chronic exercise for analysis by the Chemical Analysis Sites. The animal studies to be undertaken by the PASS will begin to elucidate the molecular pathways responsible for the acute and chronic effects of both endurance and resistance exercise on individual organs, as well as identify the interactions between organs; the goal being to understand the mechanisms by which different modes of physical activity impart their health benefits. In order to reach this goal, experts in model development and phenotyping of the resulting muscle and global health adaptations will be essential. The UC PASS team has exactly these traits. The team acknowledges that the ultimate animal model and exercise tests to be utilized in the PASS will be determined by the Molecular Transducers of Physical Activity Common (MoTrPAC) Steering Committee. In this application we provide a strong rationale and justification for the use of the rat as the animal model and propose specific endurance and resistance exercise programs to be used in Phase I of the PASS, highlighting the major advantages and limitations of each paradigm. In Phase II of the PASS we build on the models established in Phase I and propose three specific aims to begin to produce a standard curve of molecular transducers versus adaptive response to exercise. In Phase II we propose to exercise animals of increasing age or increasing adiposity, determine the adaptive response to 12 weeks of training, and relate this with the acute molecular transducer response to exercise. With this secondary screen, we will be able to identify molecular transducers that directly correlate with the local or global health benefits of exercise. We will then use this information to test the genetic requirement for these molecular transducers for the health benefits of exercise. The UC PASS is composed of an exceptional team of primary investigators and key collaborators/advisors with expertise in the development of animal models of exercise, the molecular response to exercise, and applied human exercise interventions. This team will provide leadership and the necessary skill sets to successfully model human exercise in animals, which is essential to the success of the MoTrPAC Common Fund and achievement of its goal: to define and understand the cellular and molecular mechanisms of the human health benefits of physical activity."
"9441525","ABSTRACT The kidney donor profile index (KDPI) incorporates factors known to affect allograft survival; among them, African ethnicity is a variable considered to adversely affect graft outcome. Risk variants of Apoliproprotein L1 (APOL1) gene have been recently linked to chronic kidney disease in individuals of African ancestry. Retrospective data suggest that the presence of two APOL1 risk variants in the donor can affect long-term allograft outcomes. These data will need to be validated in prospective cohorts and studied in donors of African ancestry, including the unique population of Latinos of African Descent which will be captured by our network design (Florida/Puerto Rico/US Virgin Islands). Aim 1 of this application will validate long-term graft outcomes in recipients of organs from deceased and living donors of African descent carrying two APOL1 risk variants when compared to less than two risk variants. Aim 2 will compare recipient outcomes between Latinos of African Descent and Blacks (African Americans and African Caribbeans) as well as capture potential interactions with donor-, recipient- and transplant-related ?second hits?. Aim 3 will focus on the clinical consequences of donation from individuals carrying two APOL1 risk variants and will develop translational tools for the study of ApoL1 biology to be shared with the APOLLO Network and with the scientific community. We have engaged a unique team of interdisciplinary and interinstitutional collaborators which includes five Organ Procurement Recovery Agencies as well as eight transplant centers serving Florida, Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands along with UNOS support. In addition, we are collaborating with geneticists funded by a NIH-U54 grant focused on genetic studies in diverse patient populations. To leverage our expertise, we have engaged world renowned experts in the field of ApoL1 biology/genetics as well as our Clinical and Translational Science Institute. These relationships along with our previous expertise in large multi-center longitudinal cohorts, such as NEPTUNE and CureGN, will aid in the successful development of this study at a national level."
"9358326","PROJECT SUMMARY  With one of the world's most severe HIV and TB epidemics and an economy dependent upon labor migration to South African mines, Lesotho is an optimal setting to study the effectiveness of TB/HIV integration strategies. HIV prevalence in Lesotho is 23%, the world's second highest; the TB incidence rate of 852 per 100,000 is the world's highest; 72% of TB patients are HIV positive. Basotho migrant miners, who travel between their homes in Lesotho and work in South African mines, and their families are among those with elevated risk of HIV and TB. We found that 32% of miners and miners' family members tested for HIV in three TEBA mining employment offices in Lesotho in 2014-15 were newly diagnosed with HIV; an additional 7% were known to be HIV positive. The TB incidence rate in South African miners is estimated at 3,000-7,000 per 100,000 per year, several-fold higher than that in the populations from which they originate. Testing, linkage, and retention of miners and their families along the TB/HIV care continuum are suboptimal, and TB treatment outcomes are also poor compared with the general population. Implementation science research is urgently needed to determine an effective strategy for improving early detection of HIV and early initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART) and isoniazid preventive therapy (IPT) among migrant miners and their families.  The PROvide MIner-friendly SErvices for Integrated TB/HIV Care (PROMISE) Study aims to evaluate the effectiveness, feasibility and acceptability of integrated TB/HIV services for migrant miners and their family members provided in miner-friendly service venues (MF). A prospective cohort study design will be used to compare the effectiveness of the MF intervention, which includes provision of family-focused, integrated TB/HIV diagnosis, care and treatment services at TEBA offices six days per week, to public sector health facilities, which deliver usual integrated care for TB and HIV. Additionally, we will assess HIV testing yield to identify PLHIV with CD4 count >500 cells/µl, time spent accessing ART and IPT services, and costs associated with delivery of the MF intervention. We will also explore patients' and providers' perceived barriers, facilitators and preferences to understand how they impact uptake and delivery of the MF intervention.  The study will leverage long-standing collaborations between ICAP, the Lesotho Ministry of Health, National University of Lesotho and TEBA and a well-trained, highly productive team with substantial experience in implementation science research in sub-Saharan Africa to identify an effective, feasible and acceptable TB/HIV service delivery model for migrant miners and their families that addresses barriers to implementation of early ART and IPT. The ultimate goals of the project are to 1) improve health outcomes among migrant miners and their families, a hard-to-reach population that represents a hotspot of TB/HIV transmission, in Lesotho and in PEPFAR programs more broadly; and 2) strengthen the implementation science research capacity of national and local institutions."
"9336893","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Disease risk is governed by complex interactions between an individual's genetic background and environmental exposures, yet very little is currently understood about how environmental factors influence the genome. Recent studies suggest that dietary exposure, a key environmental factor with roles in the pathogenesis of obesity, type-2-diabetes (T2D), and other complex diseases, modulates gene expression through epigenetic mechanisms. It is therefore likely that the epigenome, defined here as the overall epigenetic profile of an individual in a given cell type, represents a dynamic, reprogrammable interface through which dietary exposure shapes cellular function and disease susceptibility. Here we propose to comprehensively characterize the epigenome in individuals at high- and low-risk for developing T2D during the course of short- term overfeeding. Personalized epigenome profiles will be generated by mapping both chromatin accessibility and DNA methylation patterns in peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and integrated with transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolomic analyses. This proposal represents the first personalized, integrative epigenome mapping study of its kind. We hypothesize that changes in diet will correlate with measurable, dynamic epigenetic signatures, which will provide important insight into the mechanisms underlying gene-environment interactions and yield clinically-relevant biomarkers for both exposure and disease."
"9418908","An Approach Toward Antidotes for Phosphine More human poisonings (both accidental and deliberate) are reported worldwide due to phosphine than any other toxic substance. Aluminum and zinc phosphides are legally available from many commercial outlets in pelleted forms for use as rodenticides in the U.S. When these pellets come into contact with water (liquid/vapor) they release phosphine gas and could easily be deployed as weapons. A key target for phosphine is widely believed to be the electron transport chain of mitochondria, but there appears to be adearth of information concerning its toxic mode of action at the biochemical and cellular levels. We proposeto better identify the molecular target(s) of phosphine to facilitate future development of agents to reverse the acute toxicity. Also, since phosphine is a good ligand species, but a relatively slow acting poison mainly eliminated through exhalation, we suggest that a decorporating approach using metal ion complexes must be appropriate for ameliorating phosphine poisoning. The cobalt-containing water-soluble macrocyclic complexes we have recently shown to be effective antidotes to cyanide [Benz et al (2012) Chem. Res. Tox., 25, 2678-86; Ibid (2016)] and sulfide [Cronican et al (2015) Chem. Res. Tox., 28, 1398-1408] in mice are not antidotal toward phosphine. We hypothesize that compounds containing gold(I) will prove to be good candidate antidotes and be non-toxic at the levels required to be efficacious in treating phosphine intoxication. Aim 1. To demonstrate that while phosphine can indeed act as a mitochondrial poison through inhibition of the electron- transport chain at cytochrome c oxidase in mitochondria, that this is of less toxic consequence in vivo than damage to hemoglobin/erythrocytes. Aim 2. To determine if some easily prepared univalent gold complexes antidotal toward phosphine in mice."
"9212418","As the U.S. population ages, there is growing concern about the loss of mental acuity associated with aging. Even small deficits are considered intermediates between normal cognitive attrition and severe conditions, such as Alzheimer?s disease. Mild cognitive impairment, which affects ~10% of those ?65 years, has a 56% conversion rate to dementia over 4 years. Because of dementia?s strong age dependence, merely delaying its onset could have a dramatic impact. A 5-year delay in the onset of Alzheimer?s disease would lead to ~4 million fewer cases in the U.S. The lack of biomarkers that reflect adverse exposures and preclinical effects dramatically limits opportunities for effective targeted prevention.  Environmental exposures that augment systemic inflammation, such as ambient air pollution and metals, have been shown to hasten cognitive aging by as much as 5 years. We also recently showed that long term exposure to air pollution is associated with Alzheimer's disease incidence. Our goal is to identify new biomarkers that reflect environmental influences and predict the risk of impaired cognition. We will leverage experimental and clinical evidence on extracellular vesicles (EVs)?i.e., tiny membrane-bound vesicles actively released by tissue cells into the bloodstream?and of their bioactive cargo of micro (miRNAs) and long (lncRNAs) noncoding RNAs, which can signal inflammatory responses via their potent capacity for gene regulation. Animal and human studies have shown that environmental exposures induce the release of pro-inflammatory EVs into the bloodstream. Recent clinical data also show that changes in blood EV biomarkers precede and predict cognitive impairment. In particular, a small, but highly suggestive, case-control study identified EV-miRNAs in patients with Alzheimer?s disease, relative to controls, which were used?by means of a machine learning model (which we will also employ)?to identify early preclinical risk of Alzheimer?s disease.  In the proposed studies, we will leverage the resources of well-phenotyped longitudinal cohorts. First, in the Normative Aging Study, we will access ready-to-use longitudinal collections of biospecimens, exposure data, and cognitive function measurements from four serial visits over 12 years of follow up. We hypothesize that environmental exposures to air pollution and metals, individually and as mixtures, will be associated with significantly higher numbers of EVs and differential EV size (Aim 1). We further hypothesize that the levels of and longitudinal changes in EV-encapsulated miRNAs and lncRNAs reflect current and past environmental exposures and predict subsequent cognitive decline (Aim 2). Finally, we will use machine learning and mediation analysis to determine the roles of circulating EVs and their noncoding RNA cargo on the biological pathways linking environmental exposures to cognitive decline (Aim 3). We will validate all findings in the KORA cohort, which has similar design and data. Our work may yield a model for other potentially modifiable risk factors for impaired cognition and Alzheimer?s disease, as well as for additional age-related diseases."
"9549238","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  African Americans (AAs) are one of the largest minority populations in the United States. In 2011, 43.2 million persons in the US (14.1%) were of African ancestry. AAs exhibit a different pattern of eye disease than other racial/ethnic groups and are largely under-represented in studies of eye disease. Specifically, AAs are believed to have higher rates of visual impairment, blindness, open angle glaucoma (OAG), diabetic retinopathy (DR) but lower rates of age-related macular degeneration (AMD) than Non-Hispanic Whites (NHW) (1-5). However, most of the data that inform our estimates of the burden of eye disease in AAs are from two population based assessments initiated and conducted 20-28 years ago in Maryland (The Baltimore Eye Survey [1985-88] and The Salisbury Eye Evaluation Project [1993-95] (1, 6)). Since the completion of these two population-based studies, results of numerous clinical trials have reported the benefits of tighter glycemic control on the development of DR, and lower intraocular pressure on the development and progression of glaucoma. Findings from these two population based studies (showing the higher risk of vision loss, OAG and DR in AAs) have been incorporated into screening programs and clinical practice. Finally, with the aging of the U.S. population, the burden of age-related eye disease is likely to increase among AAs who are disproportionately impacted by obesity and diabetes. Given the implementation of numerous screening programs on AAs, the aging of the AA population, important changes in clinical practice, and the lack of recent population-based prevalence estimates, updated estimates of the burden of eye disease in AAs are needed. Characterization of the prevalence, the biological mechanisms (i.e., the risk relationships) of these diseases, and their impact on activities of daily life needs to be completed to allow for planning of preventive measures, and targeted screening and treatment programs. Further, it is crucial to determine the underlying reasons AAs may receive less follow-up eye care. Finally, while current data exists on the incidence of eye disease in NHW and Latinos, this study creates a cohort for obtaining the first incidence data on eye disease in AAs."
"9352289","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed research applies cognitive engineering methods to understand and support complex, cognition and work activities within the acute care environment, using emergency medicine as the research setting. The research will provide a fundamental and comprehensive picture of work domain complexities and challenging sensemaking, decision-making, and planning/replanning tasks; along with the individual and team expertise required to meet those challenges. The research uses emergency medicine as a field laboratory because it both explicates some of the most challenging conditions for cognitive work - high risk, time-pressure, and uncertainty - and therefore provides a strong opportunity to generalize findings to other complex health care environments; while at the same time providing an environment which can clearly benefit from the decision aids, visualizations, and other supportive technologies that can result from cognitive engineering analyses. This project utilizes the extensive prior experience of research team in human factors and cognitive engineering analyses of health care work (including emergency medicine) and other high risk work environments; and evaluating the usability and effectiveness of information displays and decision support technologies designed to support complex, cognitive work. The application addresses the fundamental, research nature of the call for applications by including a comprehensive cognitive engineering analysis of emergency medicine along with targeted development and evaluation of visualizations, decision- support, and other aiding solutions. Contributions from this research will include a fundamental understanding of the nature of cognition and clinical work in a high intensity medical environment - including both work related complexities, and practitioner expertise, knowledge, and skills - which can provided a basis for the design of health IT solutions which support clinical work and improve the effectiveness of medical care. Additionally, the research will develop and evaluate exemplar solutions for a targeted set of needs identified through the cognitive engineering analysis, thus providing a methodological example and proof-of-concept for translating cognitive engineering analyses into designs."
"9457012","PROJECT SUMMARY Immunotherapy is transforming decades of clinical practice in cancer care, but it also comes with new questions about understanding mechanisms of action contributing to both antitumor activity and potential associated toxicity. Most importantly, identifying why only a fraction of patients derives clinical benefit is at the forefront of future developments, with the ever-elusive validation of useful clinical biomarkers as the ultimate goal. As a consortium of immunologists, technologists, clinicians, computational biologists, data specialists, and biostatisticians, the Mount Sinai CIMAC (MS-CIMAC) is uniquely positioned to generate immune profiling datasets at an unprecedented level of granularity to identify biomarker signatures of disease course and response to immunotherapy in cancer patients. MS-CIMAC will take full advantage of the smart cancer immunotherapy trial designs championed by the NCI that mandate collection of baseline and on-treatment biospecimens. Key strengths of MS-CIMAC are expected to be in unique high-dimensional yet sample-sparing approaches, including CyTOF mass cytometry, seromics, microbiome, and multiplex chromogen IHC, thanks to the implementation of cutting-edge yet validated protocols and analysis pipelines. Through a comprehensive array of assays and analytical tools that bridge innovation and standardization, MS-CIMAC intends to pursue the following three aims: a) help characterize immunocompetence at baseline and assess global immune changes during treatment, b) drill down the specificity and quality of immune responses for mechanistic evaluation of drugs, and c) automate, optimize, and integrate analyses of resulting datasets to facilitate sharing, and to ultimately discover composite immune biomarkers that will impact clinical cancer care."
"9318137","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Building on its original mission of Meeting Community Needs Across the Prevention Spectrum, the Yale-Griffin Prevention Research Center remains committed to research pertaining to the primary, secondary, and tertiary prevention of chronic disease, with a particular emphasis on obesity prevention. The specific aims of the Center are to: maintain and cultivate the requisite resources and infrastructure to support a thriving research agenda; sustain and grow a research agenda that corresponds with the PRC's mission; support a core research project that will serve as a model for the National PRC Network and communities nationwide; grow a network of collaborations and partnerships with local communities; support and facilitate relevant research by others; provide training and education to staff, students, collaborators, and the members of partnering organizations and communities; support a robust and dynamic evaluation program; engage in effective communication and dissemination; and maintain the requisite resources for these functions. The Y-G PRC's primary research agenda for the upcoming 5-year cycle is to address the CDC winnable battle area of nutrition, physical activity, and obesity by using a multisite translatioal community trial (mTCT)1 approach, wherein a standard research protocol and intervention are applied in multiple sites, with tailoring using CBPR principles to meet the needs of each community. The primary study, CHOOSE (Community Health Opportunities Organized with Schools at the Epicenter), an intervention research project, involves communities in CT, MO, and KS, and entails interventions commencing with school districts as epicenters, and expanding within and beyond schools into other portals throughout their respective communities. We plan to compare 4 levels of intervention (See Appendix J) using quasi- experimental methods, with outcomes encompassing behaviors, biometrics, and anthropometrics. A similar approach will be applied in New Haven, CT, but with a focus on patient/hospital-centered rather than school- centered programming. In each case, we plan to reach groups within partnering communities with tailored multidisciplinary interventions, and aggregate the total impact and reach over time. Study objectives are to improve diet and physical activity in school-aged children and adults alike; with secondary goals of improving cardiometabolic health in both children and adults, and academic performance in children, with each measure linked to a validated assessment method. An array of established partnerships used effectively over the past 15 years for dissemination and sustainability will be leveraged to maximize the impact of this work."
"9562244","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (AD/dementia) represent a looming public health crisis, affecting roughly 5 million people in the U.S. and 11% of older adults. As with other chronic conditions, racial/ethnic and socio-economic disparities exist in the prevalence and burden of illness. However, less is known about how disparities in access to care influence the care trajectories ? i.e. the scope, frequency and sequence of services used across health care settings ? of those with AD/dementia. This retrospective, longitudinal cohort study will address this gap by using network analysis to examine care trajectories and outcomes in a racially and socioeconomically diverse sample of community-dwelling individuals with AD/dementia and unspecified cognitive impairment (CI) who may be at risk for a delayed AD/dementia diagnosis. The cohort will consist of home health care patients served by the Visiting Nurse Service of New York (VNSNY), a large, non-profit home care provider. Data will include clinical assessments for roughly 89,000 patients admitted to home care during 2010-2012 linked with 4 years of Medicare and Medicaid claims data and geographic data on neighborhood services. The specific aims are to:  (1) Describe the population at VNSNY within two diagnostic categories (AD/dementia and unspecified CI) in relation to adverse outcomes (e.g. pressure ulcers, falls, infection, dehydration, preventable hospitalization, and nursing home admission);  (2) Map, quantify and compare patterns in the care trajectories of individuals and groups that experience variable and/or disparate outcomes; and  (3) Identify strategies for implementing care trajectories with potential to reduce disparities in access and/or outcomes for AD/dementia and unspecified CI.  Applying a systems science framework, the study will use innovative network analytics to capture complex patterns in care trajectories that may contribute to adverse outcomes in a racially and socioeconomically diverse sample of individuals with these two conditions. The long-term goal of this research is to identify and, in subsequent studies, test potential home- and community-based interventions that may improve access to services and outcomes for individuals who may be underserved or at heightened risk for unmet healthcare needs. This research will produce new knowledge to aid efforts to mitigate health disparities in this vulnerable and growing population."
"9502663","ABSTRACT Despite effective combination anti-retroviral therapy (cART), HIV-infected individuals remain at an unusually high risk of morbidity and mortality from HIV-associated non-AIDS clinical conditions, such as cardiovascular disease, osteoporosis and neurocognitive decline. HIV-1 reservoir in the CNS is established in the primary phase of virus infection and can result in the development of HIV-1 associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND). While cART can dramatically reduce virus levels to undetectable levels in the CSF and improves many of the neurocognitive disorders, HIV RNA has been observed in the CSF of patients on cART that might contribute to local inflammatory processes. The excess risk for HAND is attributed to the residual immune activation that persists despite cART. Most studies point to tissue-resident cells of the myeloid lineage, perivascular macrophages and microglia as the predominant infected cells in the CNS, though mechanisms that account for chronic immune activation are varied, and include expression of neurotoxic viral proteins, gp120 and Tat, or excess production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF?, IL-1?, and MCP-1 by macrophages and microglia in response to residual viral replication. Interestingly, our preliminary findings suggest that de novo expression of HIV unspliced RNA alone from proviruses in productively infected macrophages (in the absence of viral protein production) can induce production of type I IFN responses and pro-inflammatory cytokines, IP-10 and MCP-1, suggesting that expression of viral RNA can perpetuate HAND-inducing inflammatory cycle. To better understand the mechanistic underpinnings of pathophysiology of HAND, we propose two specific aims. In aim 1, we will develop a model of neurovascular unit (NVU) in a microfluidic platform that will consist solely of primary human neuronal cells (pericytes, astrocytes, microglia and neurons) separated from the apical fluid flow by a human brain endothelial cell derived blood-brain-barrier (BBB). Using this novel in vitro primary human cell-derived model system, we will determine the impact of HIV-macrophage induced pro-inflammatory responses on BBB permeability and neuronal cell viability. In aim 2, we will determine the consequences of antiretrovirals that target viral gene expression alone as novel adjunct therapy for suppressing over-exuberant pro-inflammatory responses in the CNS. We predict that these studies will lead to the identification of the biological mechanisms that drive HAND despite effective cART. Furthermore, such insight will be critically important for development of effective strategies to decrease or reverse the persistent immune activation driving disease pathogenesis in the growing population of older individuals living with HIV."
"9445275","ABSTRACT In contrast to the decline in mortality in other cancers, the incidence of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is increasing, and therapeutic approaches, for the most part, have not been successful at improving survival in patients. Although recent advances in immunotherapy have shown efficacy in various solid cancers, comparable efficacy in PDAC has been limited by a complex tumor microenvironment (TME) that creates an immune suppressive milieu ripe for tumor progression. Thus, bold interventions that can overcome immune barriers in the PDAC TME are urgently needed to reduce the mortality stemming from this recalcitrant disease. The U01 ?Consortium for PDAC Translational Studies on the TME? was created through the National Cancer Moonshot initiative to accelerate the pace of progress in innovative therapies targeting the TME in PDAC, especially those geared towards immune-based modalities. Our proposal is in response to the companion U24 RFA to create a resource center for the five funded Consortium sites, which we call Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma Translational Resource Center (PATReC). The PATReC will be co-led by Drs. Ignacio Wistuba and Anirban Maitra, two established molecular pathologists at UT MD Anderson Cancer Center (UTMDACC) with long-standing expertise in cancer biomarkers, tissue based molecular profiling, and with respect to one co-leader (AM), specific expertise in PDAC biology, disease models and experimental therapeutics. They will be supported by an exceptional supporting cast, including Drs. Jack Lee (biostatistics), Andy Futreal (cancer genomics and computational biology), Jason Roszik (bioinformatics) and Stan Hamilton (co-leader of the NCI MATCH biorepository). The overall goal is to support the consortium efforts in multiple areas including: providing an administrative infrastructure for coordinated interactions amongst the U01 awardees; facilitating centralized biospecimen banking and distribution; enabling centralized data storage capabilities; and credentialed biostatistics and bioinformatics support with the ultimate goal of designing translationally relevant combination interventions targeting the TME in PDAC. In Aim 1, we will support administrative coordination amongst the U01 sites by ensuring effective communication, cooperation, and access to rapid data exchange that will advance the goals of the individual Consortium sites. The PATReC will serve as the central ?hub? for virtual and in-person communication across the entire Consortium. In Aim 2, we will utilize our unique institutional infrastructure to provide centralized data management services that will be readily accessible to all Consortium sites via a secure website, and provide bioinformatics and biostatics services for the analyses and interpretation of data. In Aim 3, we will standardize bio-banking activities and develop standard operation procedures (SOPs) for biospecimen collection, processing and distribution, as well as provide access to biologically relevant PDAC preclinical resources. We envision that the PATReC will be an indispensable element as we make meaningful progress towards targeting the TME in this lethal disease."
"9357388","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The overall theme of the PPG will be identifying the pathological mechanisms associated with repetitive element de-repression and the concomitant new opportunities for therapeutic development. The major projects will be: Project 1, pathways and mechanisms repressing D4Z4 repeats (Silvere van der Maarel), will identify the molecular mechanisms of repeat element repression. Project 2, repeat derepression and RNA-mediated toxicity in FSHD (Robert Bradley), will determine the molecular consequences and RNA-toxicity associated with de-repression of repetitive elements in the genome. Project 3, targeting the D4Z4 sequence to enhance repeat repression (Stephen Tapscott), will identify mechanisms of enhancing repeat-mediated epigenetic repression as a therapy for FSHD. The Bioresources Core, resources for FSHD research and clinical trials (Rabi Tawil), will provide biological resources necessary for each project and to prepare for clinical trials through development of outcomes measures, including biomarkers and patient assessments. The Administrative Core (Stephen Tapscott) will coordinate the activities and communications among the investigators and provide budgetary and administrative oversight, and coordinate the scientific oversight provided by the External Advisory Board. Together these three Projects and two Cores will address the mechanisms and pathways that converge to epigenetically silence D4Z4 in the repeat-mediated silencing pathways, determine the pathophysiologic consequences of inefficient silencing of repetitive RNAs and accumulation of aberrant RNAs, exploit new opportunities for therapeutic development, and provide the resources necessary for moving studies toward clinical trials."
"9306321","Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a devastating condition which continues to exert an overarching problem of high mortality and poor outcomes on those with this condition. Preclinical and clinical investigations strongly indicate that HBO2 is physiologically active in reducing brain injury and improving outcomes in severe TBI. However, prior to a definitive efficacy study, important information is required regarding optimizing the HBO2 treatment paradigm instituted in terms of pressure and frequency of HBO2 treatments and whether NBH enhances the clinical effectiveness of the HBO2 treatment. Based upon this promising evidence, the proposed project will be a randomized, prospective, multicenter, adaptive dose-finding clinical trial investigating the use of HBO2 treatment for patients with severe TBI. The primary objective will be to determine the most effective hyperoxia dose schedule without producing oxygen toxicity and clinical complications. Based on the sliding dichotomized GOS, the study aims to select the combination of treatment parameters (pressure and intervening NBH) that is most likely to demonstrate improvement at 6 months. Secondly, the trial also aims to determine whether there is a > 50% probability of hyperoxia treatment demonstrating improvement in the rate of good neurological outcome versus control in a subsequent confirmatory trial; and to inform decisions on proceeding to, and optimizing a subsequent confirmatory trial. The trial will be conducted in the Neurological Emergencies Treatment Trials network. This project is being submitted as two bundled grant applications for the Clinical Coordinating Center (at the University of Minnesota and the University of Michigan) and the Statistical and Data Management Center (at the Medical University of South Carolina)."
"9567708","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Age-related (senile) cataract is principally a crystallin protein aggregation and subsequent precipitation disease that occurs over the time frame of several years. During cataract development, the increased sizes of aggregated and cross-linked crystallin multimers become so large that they finally become water insoluble and cause lens opacity. Deamidation and truncations of crystallins are identified as the most abundant post-translational modifications (PTMs), and are believed to be the major causative factors in age-related cataract development. However, the mechanisms of cataract development by either deamidated- or truncated-crystallins are still unknown. Based on our extensive results, we have hypothesized that deamidated and truncation of crystallins synergistically cause cataract by producing aggregates that deposit on lens membranes and lead to fiber cells degeneration. The aggregation process is initiated by truncated crystallin fragments that form amyloid fibril-type of complexes alone and/or with fragments of deamidated crystallins, filensin and phakinin. In this process, ?A3-protease-derived fragments of deamidated crystallins play a major role. We plan to test the above hypothesis by seeking answers to the following three questions: (1) What is molecular mechanism of cataractogenesis in ?A-N101D transgenic mouse model? Our first ever available transgenic mouse model with ?A-N101D transgene develops cortical cataract at about 7-month of age. Because several preceding phenotypic changes trigger cataract development at 7-months of age in transgenic mice relative to wild type mice, the mouse model will be used to elucidate the molecular mechanism of deamidated ?AN101D-induced cataract development. (2) How is the active site of ?A3 protease regulated and activated in vivo to proteolyze crystallins? We will determine how the active site ?A3 protease is regulated intrinsically by its N terminal arm and extrinsically by ?A- and ?B-crystallins as inhibitors, and how ?A3-protease preferentially proteolyzes deamidated and/or truncated crystallins relative to unmodified crystallins in vitro and in ?A-N101D transgenic mice. (3) What is the molecular mechanism of aggregation of fragments of crystallins (derived via proteolysis by ?A3-protease) and phakinin and filensin with a deamidated 4-kDa ?B fragment? It will be determined whether amyloidogenesis is the mechanism of aggregation among crystallin fragments (derived via proteolysis by ?A3-protease), fragments of filensin and phakinin, and an in vivo existing deamidated 4-kDa ?B fragment. Because mainly human lenses will be used in these studies, the findings will be relevant to in vivo mechanism of age-related cataract development. The results will be of significant therapeutic value to delay the development and progression of age-related cataract."
"9348607","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): eHealth may be generally described as the use of Internet-based and mobile technologies to assess, monitor, and improve health. eHealth activity among post-treatment cancer survivors is a vital area of study as survivors are a growing group with greater healthcare needs than the general population and more frequent healthcare involvement. eHealth represents a promising approach to addressing the multiple and often overwhelming needs of cancer survivorship, yet data show that survivors do not engage in a wide range of eHealth activity. This raises the questions 1) to what extent are diverse cancer survivors engaged in eHealth activity, and 2) what are the determinants of eHealth activity? Previous work suggests that those with greater healthcare needs may be more likely to use eHealth resources, raising the possibility that African American (AfAm) survivors may be more likely to engage in certain eHealth activities due to the survivorship disparities experienced by this group. Furthermore, lower rates of some eHealth activities versus others make it probable that survivors use non-digital/electronic strategies to manage their healthcare needs, specifically, their personal health information management (PHIM). In the proposed R01 study, we will conduct theory-driven mixed methods interviews in a population-based sample of approximately 1230 AfAm and white breast, prostate, and colorectal cancer survivors to assess general eHealth activity as well as specific activities. We will then select a subsample of 144 participants for an ethnography of PHIM in one's home or primary PHIM setting to examine the role of eHealth in the context of all PHIM practices. Finally, these data will guide the development of survivor-centered design principles that will inform the development of a software application prototype that will facilitate access to digital cancer survivorship resources Specific aims are 1) To examine racial differences in general eHealth activity among AfAm and white cancer survivors; 2) To examine racial differences in specific categories of eHealth activity among AfAm and white cancer survivors; and 3) To explore the role of eHealth activity in the broader context of personal health information management among AfAm and white cancer survivors; 4) To develop survivor-centered design principles that will be applied to the development of an eHealth tool for cancer survivors; and Exploratory Aim - To compare cancer survivors with and without internet access in terms of social-structural determinants of access and clinical and healthcare-related factors relevant to survivorship. The proposed study is relevant to public health because it will investigate eHealth activity among cancer survivors, of which there are 13.7 million in the U.S. today, many of whom confront a wide range of challenges to their physical, psychological, and social well-being. The technology within eHealth resources has the potential to address the needs of this population on a large scale. The proposed population-based study will identify determinants of eHealth activity, provide deep insight into the role of eHealth in survivors' overall PHIM, and establish survivor-centered design principles for optimized eHealth tool development."
"9447549","Project Summary: Intestinal homeostasis is crucial for normal intestinal functions, and its disruption may lead to the pathogenesis of human diseases such as chronic inflammation and even cancer. Paneth cells play crucial roles in intestinal barrier function and mucosal immunity. Recent studies have demonstrated that impaired function of Paneth cells may lead to dysbiotic intestine and increased susceptibility to inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The Ufm1 (Ubiquitin-fold modifier 1) conjugation system is a novel ubiquitin-like system that consists of Ufm1- sepcific E1 enzyme (Uba5), E2 enzyme (Ufc1) and a putative E3 enzyme (a protein complex containing Ufl1 and Ufbp1). Clinical and animal model studies implicate its potential involvement in many diseases such as neurological disorders, ischemic injury and cancer, but its overall functions and underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Genetic studies from others and us have recently demonstrated the essential role of this system in embryonic development and hematopoiesis, but its role in other systems remains to be defined. Ufl1 and Ufbp1, the key components of Ufm1 E3 ligase, are present in multiple tissues and organs and highly expressed in the intestine, yet their role in the gut is completely unknown. The observation of frequent gut bleeding in Ufl1 and Ufbp1 knockout mice prompted us to generate IEC (intestinal epithelial cell)-specific knockout mouse models of Ufl1 and Ufbp1. We found that IEC-specific ablation of either Ufl1 or Ufbp1 caused nearly complete loss of Paneth cells and partial loss of goblet cells, resulting in increased susceptibility to experimental colitis. Moreover, Ufbp1 ablation led to elevated ER (endoplasmic reticulum) stress, activation of the Unfolded Protein Response (UPR) and apoptosis in IECs. We also observed dramatic increase of mRNAs of secretory proteins such as lysozyme during the course of acute Ufbp1 ablation. We hypothesize that Ufbp1 and the ufmylation pathway plays a pivotal role in IRE1-mediated degradation of ER-associated mRNAs, thereby coordinating protein synthesis and ER protein load and maintaining ER homeostasis of Paneth cells. Ufbp1 deficiency impairs this degradation mechanism and leads to increased mRNAs and protein translation, resulting in elevated ER stress and Paneth cell death. To test this hypothesis, we propose three specific aims. Aim 1: To define Paneth cell-specific function of Ufbp1; Aim 2: To investigate the role of UPR in Paneth cell apoptosis induced by Ufbp1 deficiency; and Aim 3: To elucidate the mechanism of Ufbp1 ablation-induced disruption of ER homeostasis. The outcome of this project will provide critical insight into the physiological function and working mechanism of this important protein modification system in maintaining intestinal homeostasis., and have a significant impact on our understanding of Paneth cell biology, development of novel therapeutic targets for inflammatory disease, and the physiological function of the ufmylation pathway and its interplay with UPR."
"9287966","The overarching goal of this proposal is to aggregate, harmonize and secure the rich collection of data acquire across all waves of the Seattle Longitudinal Study (SLS) from 1956 to 2012, creating a valuable and accessible resource for epidemiological research on Alzheimer?s Disease (AD), as well as normal aging. Begun in 1956 and now active for 60 years, the SLS is one of the oldest and longest running studies of longitudinal change in cognition and the protective and risk factors associated with normal and pathological aging, involving over 5,000 participants. It represents a population-based, randomized sample recruited from a large health maintenance organization in western Washington. The study is unique in its cohort sequential design that examines cognitive and psychosocial change in birth cohorts from 1889 through 1976, thus providing opportunity to examine cognitive change in multiple birth cohorts over the same chronological age range. The study involves not only extensive cognitive longitudinal data sets but also multiple biomarkers of significance in AD, including blood samples with APOE genotyping, brain tissue at autopsy, and longitudinal multi-occasion neuroimaging data sets. Unlike most prospective AD studies beginning in old age, the SLS (age range: 22-100+ yrs) permits examination of cognitive change from young adulthood to very old age. The Laboratory of Neuro Imaging (LONI) will provide a secure data repository infrastructure for the SLS from which all data and supporting documents will be broadly accessible to the research community worldwide for the first time. Use of innovative approaches will provide an interactive and visual view of the entire SLS data set, harmonizing the multiple waves of SLS data into a uniform data model. A search interface will be provided to permit download of SLS data without extensive preprocessing before incorporating it into subsequent analyses. NCRAD will serve as a repository for blood and brain autopsy biomarkers with linkages to data within the LONI repository. Creation of rich archives can have a positive impact on scientists, research funders and potential for effective reuse of data extending beyond the original intent for which it was collected."
"9551199","Project Summary: One potentially important approach to restore vision is the regeneration of lost retinal neurons from an endogenous population of retinal cells, the Müller glia. To explore the potential of ultimately stimulating the resident Müller glia in the damaged human retina, we will take a comparative approach using zebrafish (regeneration competent), chick (regeneration limited), and mouse (regeneration refractory). We will conduct a comprehensive and unbiased, comparative analysis of gene expression and chromatin conformation in isolated retinal progenitor cells and Müller glia in developing zebrafish, chick, and mouse retinas. We will also study changes Müller glia from all three model organisms as they are activated/reprogrammed in response to retinal injury (light damage, NMDA) or exposure to extrinsic factors that are capable of inducing their activation in the absence of retinal damage. Aims 1 and 2 will generate transcriptome and chromatin data of genes and chromatin structures that are associated with formation of Müller glia progenitor cells. In Aim 3, we will integrate this data using newly developed bioinformatic analysis to identify transcription factors and transcriptional networks that control neurogenic competence in Müller glia from each organism. In Aim 4, we will validate and test candidate genes in regulating the dedifferentiation of Müller glia in zebrafish, chick, and mice, using a combination of gain- and loss-of-function approaches. This work will begin to identify the transcription factors and miRNAs that regulate the extent of retinal regeneration in the three different model organisms. Understanding how to restore Müller glia to a youthful status will enable targeted regenerative retinal therapies."
"9564596","Abstract Bone fractures, due to aging and disease, contribute significantly to healthcare cost and affect the quality of life with aging and disease. Non-enzymatic glycation (NEG) is a post-translational modification process by sugars on long-lived proteins. In bone, NEG's effects on bone matrix proteins are associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) and linked to bone fragility fractures. NEG results in the accumulation of fluorescent and non-fluorescent advanced glycation end- products (AGEs). Currently, pentosidine (PEN) is the only established measure of NEG in bone. However, it represents only a small fraction of fluorescent AGEs (fAGEs). Thus, the extent of NEG in bone and how it influences bone fragility remains unknown.  Here we demonstrate, for the first time, the formation of carboxy-methyl lysine (CML) in bone and modification of the collagen-hydroxyapatite (HA) distance by AGEs. CML is a non- fluorescent AGE that has a short metabolic pathway and can form in more significant amounts than other AGEs, influencing bone fragility. In the previous grant cycle, we showed that cancellous bone accumulates more AGEs than cortical bone. Here we show that the amount of AGEs in cancellous bone and cortical shell associate differently with pre- and post- yield mechanical properties of whole vertebra. Accumulation of AGEs in cortical and cancellous bone may therefore better explain whole bone fractures. We also show increased accumulation of AGEs and loss of fracture toughness using a high fat diet rat model which simulates T2D in humans without the confound of genetic mutations. Furthermore, AGEs in bone can be cleaved by phenacylthiazolium-based compounds to rescue bone fragility.  Thus our overall goal is to determine the effects of AGEs and their removal on diabetic and fragility fractures. Using a combination of in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo models we will pursue the following aims: Aim 1: To establish the proportion of CML, PEN and fAGEs in cortical and cancellous bone and determine whether accumulation of AGEs causes the modification of the collagen-HA interface; Aim 2: To determine the contribution of cortical and cancellous bone AGEs on whole bone fragility and evaluate whether their removal rescues bone fragility in an ex vivo human model; Aim 3: To establish the role of AGEs in causing increased bone fragility in T2D, using a validated diet-induced rat model, and to test whether removal of AGEs and rescue T2D bone fragility. Our findings will lead to the development of novel modalities for determining fracture risk, new understanding of T2D and fragility fractures, and new approaches to control skeletal fragility by managing AGEs."
"9479802","PROJECT SUMMARY OVERALL We propose a Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome Collaborative Research Center at The Jackson Laboratory (JAX ME/CFS CRC) to identify the fundamental mechanisms by which a tri- component network of systems?the microbiome, metabolism and the immune system?interact to cause or exacerbate disease. ME/CFS is a debilitating illness that lacks widely accepted therapies for its management as well as meaningful understanding of its biological underpinnings. Mounting evidence indicates a significant role for immunological abnormalities, which are thought to contribute to disease progression. The microbiome recently emerged as a potential contributor to immune perturbations, as it is intimately linked with immune activation and homeostasis as well as host metabolic changes, and its dysbiosis has been linked to chronic inflammation. Metabolomic studies suggest altered metabolic states in ME/CFS patients compared to healthy controls, which could have downstream?or reciprocal?effects on sugar, energy levels, immune cell activity, and microbial dysbiosis. However, small sample sizes, lack of cohesive clinical data and biological sample collection, and overall focus on one component of the network has limited the impact of these studies. The JAX ME/CFS CRC seeks to transform the landscape of knowledge of ME/CFS using a multi-disciplinary systems biology approach to integrate phenotypic and functional immune changes in ME/CFS patients with microbiome and metabolic parameters. We hypothesize that the immune system's etiological role in ME/CFS is predicated on two major factors: 1) that immune cells are programmed to respond aberrantly to environmental stimuli, and 2) that ME/CFS patients harbor microbes that aberrantly stimulate immune cells, either directly or through metabolic byproducts. To probe this hypothesis, we structured the JAX ME/CFS CRC around two integrated research projects and a prospective cohort of ME/CFS patients and healthy controls in which blood, fecal samples and a range of clinical parameters are acquired longitudinally. Our Center will bring together ME/CFS clinicians, experts in immunology, microbiome, and computational biology, and community stakeholders to achieve our scientific goals and maximize the impact of our research on those affected by the disease. Our Aims are: 1) Develop a comprehensive and prospective database of immune, metabolomics and microbiome profiles of ME/CFS patients (Clinical Research Project); 2) Establish a platform for mechanistic discoveries on role of ME/CFS microbiota and immune response (Basic Research Project); 3) Rapidly implement recruitment of the ME/CFS prospective clinical cohort (Clinical Core); and 4) Coordinate an integrative, multidisciplinary group in ME/CFS research (Admin Core). In addition, we will capitalize on both on scientific expertise and vast mouse genetic resource of the JAX to develop highly collaborative inter-CRC projects to understand role of epigenetics, developing mouse models for microbiome-immune interactions and neurological symptoms. Together, these will allow strategies for patient diagnosis and future clinical trials."
"9330909","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cardiovascular disease as result of metabolic syndrome continues to be a major health burden worldwide, regardless of the numerous available therapeutic strategies. Derangements in systemic energy homeostasis are the result of metabolic dysfunction within individual tissues as well as in defective communication between tissues. Understanding metabolic coordination within a particular tissue and throughout the body will lead to new and improved therapeutic avenues. We recently uncovered an important role of the heart in systemic energy homeostasis, thus establishing the precedent that the heart is capable of intertissue metabolic communication to elicit fuel partitioning between tissues globally. However, the molecular details of the signals emanating from the heart and the role of this cardiometabolic axis in disease are unexplored. We have identified 2 uncharacterized muscle-specific lipid reductase enzymes capable of generating metabolites that could confer the heart this ability. In the first aim of this proposal, we will interrogate the functions of each of these enzymes in cardiomyocytes using gain- and loss-of-function animal models. The final aim of this proposal will test the role of each lipid reductase in mediating inter-tissue communication from myocytes to other tissues of the body. The overall goal of this proposal is to test the hypothesis that the heart signals to other tissues by secreting lipid-derived metabolites that act as signaling effectors, with the prediction that we will uncover novel ways in which striated muscles communicate to other tissues. Overall, these studies will provide new insights into myocyte endocrine signaling and the regulation of systemic energy metabolism by striated muscle and may yield novel therapeutic strategies for modulating these processes in the settings of cardiometabolic disease."
"9432231","PROJECT SUMMARY TBI is a prevalent and devastating health issue worldwide. Despite extensive research in neuroprotective therapies, and success in pre-clinical models, multiple clinical trials have failed to demonstrate efficacy, such that there are still no targeted treatments available for TBI. TBI is a heterogenous disease, influenced by mechanical forces, genetic factors, and secondary insults that compound the primary injury. A major limitation hindering the development of TBI therapies is the lack of reliable biomarkers of specific injury mechanisms in TBI. Substantial data point to traumatic microvascular injury (TMI) as a key component of TBI-associated disability: pathological studies demonstrate that TMI is a nearly universal, albeit under-studied, endophenotype of TBI and vascular dysfunction underlies many of the chronic neurological symptoms that complicate TBI recovery. Because there are multiple pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic therapies that promote vascular health, TMI is an attractive target for therapeutic intervention after TBI. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that traumatic microvascular injury is a prominent TBI endophenotype that is predictive of patient outcome. The objectives of the proposed study are to: (1) describe the natural history of TMI using neuroimaging, (2) develop diagnostic and prognostic miRNA biomarkers of TMI, and (3) describe the correlation between the neuroimaging and miRNA biomarkers and clinical outcomes after traumatic brain injury. In the context of this study, the candidate will train in clinical and translational research methods with focused, individualized mentoring to support her transition to independently funded, patient-oriented research. This proposal will leverage an ongoing prospective cohort study of individuals with traumatic brain injury who undergo detailed demographic, clinical, neuroimaging, and neuropsychological assessments from their acute injury through chronic recovery. In addition to completing the proposed research, the applicant will engage in a rigorous training program of didactic courses and mentoring by experts in neurotrauma, brain imaging, miRNAs, and vascular biology. She will gain expertise in clinical study design and management, sequencing and molecular laboratory techniques, and advanced statistical methodologies relevant to clinical research. The applicant's progress and attainment of specific benchmarks in research and career development will be regularly reviewed by her mentors who have extensive experience in training junior investigators and facilitating their transition to independent research careers. Completion of the proposed study will be facilitated by an institutional environment that prioritizes collaboration, and provides exemplary research and career support. Through the conduct of the proposed study, the applicant will make significant contributions to the understanding of traumatic microvascular injury and describe neuroimaging and molecular biomarkers necessary for future projects examining vascular-directed therapies in traumatic brain injury."
"9456164","Summary It has been stated that ?a person is only as old as his/her arteries? (Sir William Osler ~ 1898). With aging, large central arteries such as the aorta and carotid arteries lose their elasticity while small peripheral arteries lose their ability to dilate and constrict in response to perturbations. Vascular dysfunction may affect blood flow delivery to the brain, directly impacting cognitive performance. African Americans have premature vascular aging, which may contribute to premature cognitive aging. In our first aim, we will examine racial differences in novel measures of arterial stiffness, endothelial function, cerebral blood flow and cognitive function. In our second aim, we will explore dynamic changes in aforementioned parameters during a cognitive challenge. Results from this study may suggest a crucial vascular component to racial differences in cognitive performance. Early intervention to target specific aspects of premature vascular aging in AAs as identified in this study may lead to better preservation of cognitive function with advancing age and help abrogate racial disparities in hypertensive cerebrovascular damage and cognitive impairment in later life."
"9382102","Detection of novel stimuli that may predict reward or punishment requires long-term memory for, and recognition of, stimuli that are familiar. Novelty detection and familiarity recognition are often impaired in neuropsychiatric disease, so understanding the neurobiological underpinnings is an important goal. We recently discovered that memory of visual stimulus familiarity is stored via synaptic modifications in primary visual cortex of mice. The primary aims of our research are now to (a) identify how information is stored by the collective activity of neurons in primary visual cortex, (b) pinpoint the key sites in the cortical microcircuit where the essential synaptic modifications occur, and (c) examine a specific hypothesis that memory is expressed by switching the state of activity in the reciprocal connections between visual cortex and thalamus. Beyond the relevance of our proposed research to identifying the mechanisms underlying visual recognition memory, they will broaden our understanding of how primary sensory areas are modified by sensory experience in order to modify behavior, which remains one of the great challenges in basic neuroscience."
"9411519","Project Summary: Apathy is a common motivational alteration in HIV-1+ individuals, affecting between 30-60% of the population, despite antiretroviral therapy. The high prevalence of apathy in HIV-1+ individuals is one of the biggest challenges facing HIV clinicians and researchers alike; there is a critical need to develop treatment approaches for HAND. Using the HIV-1 transgenic (Tg) rat model in a prospective longitudinal design, we will test the hypothesis that the development and progression of dysregulation of motivational processes associated with HIV-1 are consequent to synaptodendritic pathology, neuroinflammation and oxidative stress of the dopamine (DA) system in the prefrontal cortex-basal ganglia axis, and that the trajectory of motivational dysregulation will be altered with a therapeutic approach targeted to the mesocorticolimbic DA system. The specific aims are: 1) To establish the development and progression of motivational dysregulation in the HIV-1 Tg rat as measured with drug, food, and natural reinforcers, as distinct from potential changes in sensory and activity confounds. The progression of neurocognitive dysfunction will be assessed with periodic tests from pre-adolescence through advanced age, given the exponential growth of 65+ year old HIV+ patients. Both males and females will be examined. 2) To establish the progression of CNS synaptodendritic pathology in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and medium spiny neurons (MSN) of the nucleus accumbens of the HIV-1 Tg rat with a focus on quantifying dendritic branching and spine parameter alterations. Specifically, synaptodendritic complexity, neuroinflammation, and oxidative stress will be assessed in different cohorts as the basis of the dysregulation of motivational processes. 3) To establish the treatment of the dysregulation of motivational processes consequent to chronic, low-level inflammation and HIV-1 protein exposure with currently used agonists or antagonists, or novel agents, targeted to the identified DA system dysfunction. With currently used agonists or antagonists, or novel agents, targeted to the identified DA system dysfunction we will mechanistically test the functional role of the neurobiological changes in the DA receptors and dopamine transporter (DAT) as a neurochemical mechanism contributing to, if not mediating, the motivational dysregulation consequent to chronic expression of the HIV-1 transgene. Initially we will establish the optimal therapeutic window. These studies will establish the functional role of alterations in synapto- dendritic complexity, neuroinflammation and oxidative stress as neurobiological mechanisms contributing to, if not mediating, the dysregulation of motivational systems consequent to chronic expression of the HIV-1 transgene. The program goal of our longitudinal studies is to establish our ability to predict motivational dysregulation as a function of chronic expression of the HIV-1 transgene, to provide a greater mechanistic understanding of the interrelationships of HIV-1-induced apathy and DA system dysfunction, and to improve the therapeutic options relevant to HIV-1+ individuals and improve their quality of life."
"9379807","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):      We propose a randomized, controlled trial of a telephone-based, brief insomnia treatment in primary care in order to accomplish the goal of improving psychosocial functioning in post-deployment Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans who meet criteria for Insomnia Disorder. The primary outcome for the trial will be psychosocial functioning, with insomnia severity serving as the secondary outcome. Additional goals include evaluating durability of treatment gains and obtaining feedback from participants about the utility and feasibility of the proposed insomnia treatment.  One hundred Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans with Insomnia Disorder will be randomly assigned to either Brief Behavioral Treatment for Insomnia (BBTI; one 60-minute and one 30-minute in-person encounter, and two 20-minute phone-based encounters) or a Progressive Muscle Relaxation Training control group (manualized relaxation training delivered by two in-person and two phone sessions, matched to the BBTI condition for therapist time). Prior to randomization, participants will complete clinician-administered, mental health diagnostic interviews at baseline (and post-treatment). Psychosocial functioning, insomnia severity, and other related self-report measures will be completed at baseline (pre-treatment), mid-treatment, post-treatment, and at 6-month follow-up (active treatment group only). Sleep parameters (e.g., sleep diaries, rest activity) will be completed with a sleep diary mobile application and the Basis wristband (Basis Science Inc., San Francisco) and associated mobile application that tracks sleep cycles and sleep and waking movement, which will be provided for each participant. One week of sleep parameters data will be collected at baseline as well as post-treatment (and at 6-month follow-up for active treatment group only). Both groups will also collect sleep parameters data during the four-week intervention period.  We will conduct post-treatment evaluations with the experimental group to help determine the utility of BBTI as well as how the intervention may be improved for Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans. Veterans who received BBTI will complete a feedback questionnaire that will inquire about various aspects of the treatment. The goal is that 75% of Veterans will report that the treatment is feasible and acceptable in various domains, as measured by a rating of three or higher on a five-point Likert scale. Veterans who complete BBTI also will be asked to participate in a 30-minute feedback interview reviewing ratings of each of the domains, as well as most and least helpful aspects of the treatment, data which will be audio recorded and coded. These post- treatment interviews with Veterans will yield suggestions on how the treatment can best be improved for Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans and be implemented in primary care settings. Trained coders will be asked to categorize areas identified by Veterans as helpful and areas noted as needing improvement until no new categories are identified (e.g., thematic saturation). These suggestions will be systematized and used to prepare the treatment for implementation with Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans in primary care. This trial will provide useful information regarding rehabilitative outcomes, and it will yield specific information that will allow us to modify BBTI, ensuring a tailored product based on Veteran feedback."

"9291736","Dr. Bell is requesting renewal of his SRCS for an additional 5 years at which point Dr. Bell will have 47 years of VA service. During these 5 years he plans to continue to vigorously pursue his research, education, administrative and service mission.  Dr. Bell has been involved in VA rehabilitation research for four decades. During that time he has helped shape the field of vocational rehabilitation and cognitive remediation, and many of his innovations have been adopted into clinical practice and have inspired new research by investigators nationally and internationally. His research has focused on 1) vocational rehabilitation, 2) neurocognitive and social cognitive deficits and their relationships to functional impairments, 3) development of assessment instruments, 4) cognitive remediation, and 5) substance abuse rehabilitation. He has a consistent record of successful research with funding from VA RR&D, NIMH, NIDA, DoD and NSF. Currently, he is principal investigator of a new VA RR&D MERIT grant, a new NSF grant, a NIMH research training grant, and a current DoD grant. Dr. Bell plans to continue to work on these currently funded grants during the period of this proposed renewal of his SRCS. He hopes that findings from his currently funded projects will serve as the foundation for future grant submissions.  Dr. Bell also plans to continue his scientific contributions in terms of publications and presentations. During his current SRCS funding, he has published 44 peer reviewed articles, 5 book chapters, 1 new testing instrument (Social Attribution Test-Multiple Choice) and has given more than 40 scientific presentations. Two of Dr. Bell's contributions to assessment are used nationally and internationally in psychiatric clinical trials and are regarded as the ?gold standard? for measuring work performance and for measuring social cognition. One indication of his status as a leader in psychiatric rehabilitation is that he was recently selected by the World Health Organization to be one of three USA psychiatric rehabilitation experts for their 24-member international panel for the development of the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF-11) and was then selected to be one of 4 team leaders on the project.  Dr. Bell is an accomplished educator and mentor in his field with more than 48 mentees during his career, many of whom have gone on to independent research careers. Fourteen are currently working for the VA. In 2001, Dr. Bell was awarded a prestigious training grant (NIMH T32) to provide training to clinicians to do research in functional disability interventions. This award has been twice competitively renewed because of its significant impact on bringing young and promising investigators into the field of rehabilitation. He plans to continue these activities during the next period of his SRCS.  Dr. Bell has provided significant administrative service to the VA by assuming the considerable responsibilities of being Chairman of the Human Studies Subcommitte.at VACHS. He also has served on 18 review panels for VA RR&D and NIMH during his current SRCS and plans to continue these efforts on behalf of the VA research mission.  Finally, Dr. Bell continues to provide direct service to Veterans. During this current SRCS period, Dr. Bell began an outreach effort to college Veterans (Veteran Integration To Academic Leadership - VITAL) at VACHS and is providing direct clinical and psycho-educational assessment services with a small team that he manages. They are currently serving 7 area universities, and during the proposed renewal of his SRCS period, he plans to continue to expand this project."
"9423750","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Hispanic immigrants to the U.S. are more likely to experience negative health outcomes the longer they live in the U.S. For example, over time Hispanic immigrants engage in riskier behaviors such as substance abuse, violence, and risky sex, and experience more depressive symptoms. The stress associated with the acculturation process, acculturation stress, and resilience at the individual, family, community, and societal levels appear to play important roles in influencing risks. However, little is known about the causal mechanisms linking acculturation stress, resilience, and health outcomes among Hispanic immigrants. Further, little is known about what precise types of stressors (e.g., occupational stress vs. discrimination) and resilience factors (e.g., individual coping vs. family support) have the most important influence on health trajectories of Hispanic immigrants. The proposed longitudinal study (N = 385) will investigate the effects of acculturation stress and resilience on co-occurring substance abuse, intimate partner violence, HIV risk, and depression (i.e., syndemic conditions) and biological stress among young adult Hispanic immigrants in the U.S. More specifically, the proposed project aims to: 1) test theoretical links between the cumulative impact of acculturation stress and resilience on syndemic conditions and biological stress among recent young adult Hispanic immigrants over a two-year period, and 2) identify the specific types of acculturation stressors and resilience factors at the individual, family, community, and societal levels that are most important in predicting syndemic conditions and biological stress among this population over time. Young adult low-income Hispanic immigrant men and women within the first 10 years of immigration will be followed for two years. Biopsychosocial data will be collected from participants at baseline, and then 6 months (FU1), 12 months (FU2), 18 months (FU3), and 24 months later (FU4). Culturally specific measures of acculturation stress and resilience will be used to assess for individual, family, community, and societal risk and protective factors for syndemic conditions. Blood and urine samples will be obtained from participants to measure systemic inflammation (IL 6, IL8, and IL 18) and oxidative stress (F2 isoprostanes), previously validated biomarkers for psychological stress. Various descriptive, univariate and multivariate statistics, including latent growth curve modeling, will be used to address aims 1-2. The findings from this study have the potential to identify risk and protective factors for the decay in heath among Hispanic immigrants. A precise and culturally informed understanding of these phenomena is foundational for designing interventions that can ultimately promote the health and wellbeing of Hispanic immigrants, the largest immigrant group in the U.S. This study also has the potential to lay the theoretical foundation for biopsychosocial health disparities research in other populations."
"9551796","When attention to a stimulus is prolonged over minutes to hours it is referred to as vigilance, and when vigilance is abnormally increased it is referred to as hypervigilance ? `the excessive readiness to select and respond to a kind of stimulus'. Vigilance and hypervigilance are related dimensions of pain and are found in idiopathic and `nociceptive' pain syndromes, although our understanding of their neural basis is limited. We propose to adapt a Continuous Performance Task from Human Factors to the study of pain, i.e. CPTpain. In this task, the subject pushes a button to indicate detection of painful target stimuli when they occur in a train of nontarget nonpainful stimuli, and vigilance to pain can be measured by detected nontargets and arousal. We propose to use a CPTpain as we record and analyze local field potentials (LFP) during the week between the implantation and removal of grid electrodes on the brain for the treatment of intractable epilepsy, which is a platform for studies of pain with unrivaled resolution and clarity. We hypothesize a network for vigilance to pain that includes frontal, parietal and cingulate modules based upon imaging studies of vigilance to visual targets. This type of network includes modules and the connections between modules that we will identify (as in the past) by the causal interactions between them, where causal interactions are inferred if past knowledge of activity at a module reduces the prediction error for activity at a second module.  Our Preliminary Data shows that detected nontargets and arousal in a CPTpain are associated with increased sensitivity to acute painful stimuli, i.e. vigilance might influence pain. These Data also demonstrate a Parietal EEG Signature for vigilance to pain that is correlated with errors and so suggest parietal involvement in a distributed network for vigilance to pain. Although modules and interactions that have a critical role in vigilance to pain cannot be identified by analysis of LFPs (or fMRI), they can be demonstrated by studies of the effect of lesions on errors and arousal in a CPTpain. Therefore, we propose novel studies of MRI scans and measures of vigilance to pain in patients admitted to The Johns Hopkins Hospital with acute strokes by using software packages for analysis of lesions (LDDMM) with our long term collaborator Dr Hillis, who has used these packages extensively for the study of attention. Finally, our preliminary data demonstrates that parietal structures are spared in patients with insular strokes who develop Central Post Stroke Pain (CPSP), which is consistent with parietal involvement in vigilance as a mechanism of CPSP.  The results of these novel proposed studies are expected to frame testable hypotheses for the neuroscience of vigilance to pain, and for anatomically based surgical or stimulation therapies for pain syndromes associated with hypervigilance. The potential of analyses of networks for vigilance to pain is suggested by the impact of network analysis on the neuroscience of vision, and on surgical and stimulation therapies for the treatment of movement and psychiatric disorders."
"9482345","PROJECT SUMMARY  Cognitive deficits are a significant clinical problem associated with HIV infection (HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders or HAND). We have recently[1] showed that an HIV coat peptide (HIV Gp120 V3 loop peptide or HIV-V3 peptide), known to bind and activate a receptor that mediates HIV cellular entry (CCR5), caused acute memory deficits[1], that could be prevented by a CCR5 knockout or viral vector-mediated knockdown of this receptor[1]. Additionally, while transgenic overexpression of CCR5 in neurons resulted in hippocampus-dependent learning and memory deficits[1], decreasing the function of CCR5 enhances hippocampus-dependent memory (e.g., spatial and contextual learning) by enhancing canonical memory mechanisms, including MAPK/CREB signaling leading to enhanced long-term potentiation (LTP). Knock-down of this receptor in retrosplenial cortex (RSC) also enhances spatial learning, and two-photon microscopy studies of spine turnover in this structure showed that CCR5 knock out increases spine turnover before learning and spine clustering after learning, two structural markers of enhanced learning and memory. Overall, our results demonstrate that CCR5 plays an important role in neuroplasticity and learning and memory, and demonstrate that while knockdown of CCR5 enhances plasticity and learning, over-activation of this receptor has the opposite effect[1], suggesting that CCR5 over-activation by viral proteins may contribute to HAND[1] [2]. Here, we propose integrative multidisciplinary studies with state-of-the-art approaches, such as head- mounted fluorescent microscopes (miniscopes) developed in our laboratory that can be used to track neuronal activation in freely moving mice [3]. These studies have two key goals: 1- To determine whether the GFAP- gp120 transgenic model [2, 4] or the HIV-V3 peptide specifically targeted to the adult RSC, disrupt MAPK and CREB signaling, LTP, spatial and contextual learning and memory, and whether this can be prevented by a CCR5 knockout, viral knockdown of this receptor, or by a FDA approved drug that inhibits CCR5 (Maraviroc) with or without combination antiretroviral therapy (cART); 2- To test whether spatial representations, measured with GCAMP6f and miniscopes, in the hippocampus and in the RSC are disrupted by the HIV-V3 peptide or in the GFAP-gp120 transgenic model, and whether this can be prevented by a CCR5 knockout, CCR5 viral knockdown, or by cART with or without Maraviroc. Beyond elucidating molecular, cellular and circuit mechanisms responsible for the learning and memory deficits caused by HIV proteins, the studies proposed here will also test specific treatments that could be potentially used to design clinical interventions targeted to the earlier stages of HIV infection. The relative lack of neuropathology attributed to HIV infection in cART-treated subjects [5], argues that the mechanisms responsible for HAND are likely due to functional alterations in neurons, such as the ones we propose to study here."
"9565313","PROJECT SUMMARY  Cellular senescence is a multi-faceted stress response that has become increasingly implicated as a driver of aging and many age-related pathologies. This proposal aims to renew a long-standing grant that has supported our work to understand the basic physiological and pathophysiological consequences of the senescence response. Through the use of simple and complex human and mouse cell cultures and a newly described mouse model developed by us, we propose a series of experiments that will provide a more in-depth understanding of the relationship between senescent cells, their presence and phenotypes during organismal aging, and aging phenotypes. We propose to provide answers to three crucial outstanding questions in aging research that have been unanswerable until recently. First, what are the occurrences, sub-tissue localization, cell type-specificities and phenotypic characteristics of senescent cells that accumulate during aging across tissues? Second, what are the phenotypes of senescent cells that accumulate in during aging compared to those that occur during wound healing? And finally, what is the impact of senescent cells on the apparent stochastic variation in aging phenotypes and life span among genetically identical mice? Together, these aims will fill crucial gaps in our knowledge about how senescent cells contribute to aging phenotypes and, consequently, organismal health span and ultimately life span."
"9565294","Project Summary  Age-related diseases are the major causes of morbidity and mortality in Western society. Calorie restriction (CR), a dietary intervention which extends lifespan while delaying or preventing age-related disease, is one plausible approach to lessen the burden of these diseases, but reduced-calorie diets are notoriously difficult to sustain. Recent studies have highlighted an important role for dietary protein in health and longevity, with low protein (LP) diets shown to promote longevity and to mimic the metabolic benefits of CR. We have found that specifically reducing dietary consumption of the three branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) ? leucine, isoleucine, and valine ? promotes metabolic health in both young and aged mice, and promotes longevity in progeroid mice. Determining the effect of Low BCAA diets on longevity, and identifying the physiological and molecular mechanisms by which dietary BCAAs influence metabolism, will provide mechanistic insight into the regulation of healthy aging. Eventually, this will permit the development of new pharmacological approaches to prevent or delay age-related diseases.  Here, we will rigorously test the hypothesis that a Low BCAA diet can promote health and longevity in mice, examining the effect of long-term Low BCAA diet on lifespan, metabolic health, and frailty, and testing the efficacy of short-term Low BCAA diet feeding as a late-life intervention. We will determine if reduced consumption of the BCAAs mediates the metabolic effects of CR and LP diets. Using a mouse model of reduced BCAA catabolism, we will identify the distinct roles played by the BCAAs as substrates for building proteins, and as a source for metabolically active BCAA catabolites. Finally, we will examine the cell autonomous effects of the BCAAs and their catabolites on the function and metabolism of primary hepatocytes and pancreatic islets ex vivo using novel metabolic sensors, and test candidate molecular mediators of these effects.  The proposed work will examine the role of the branched-chain amino acids on health and longevity for the first time, and address long-standing questions regarding how dietary quality ? the specific composition of the diet ? impacts healthy aging. Importantly, we will gain new insight into the physiological and molecular mechanisms that drive the potent effects of CR and LP diets. In the long term, this work will enable our laboratory and others to develop a mechanistic understanding of how dietary branched-chain amino acids and other macronutrients regulate health and disease vulnerability, and to identify new targets for the pharmacological treatment of age-related diseases and the promotion of healthy aging."
"9445681","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Adenoviruses (AdV) are common human pathogens that cause typical cold symptoms in healthy indi- viduals, but can potentially progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) with up to 50% mortality, particularly in highly susceptible, immunosuppressed people, and new, potentially lethal variants continue to emerge each year. No therapeutic that specifically prevents or treats AdV infection exists and the development of novel treatments would prevent the morbidity and potentially mortality associated with AdV infection.  The objective of this proposal is to determine the mechanism of action and anti-adenovirus efficacy of novel molecules that decrease apical Coxsackievirus and adenovirus receptor (CAREx8) protein expression. Our central hypothesis is that decoy peptides that block the interaction between MAGI-1 and CAREx8 destabi- lize apical CAREx8 protein in the airway to abrogate AdV entry and pathogenesis. We will test our hypothesis using polarized model epithelia with Dox-inducible CAREx8 expression, well-differentiated primary human and rodent airway epithelia to validate our findings, and the cotton rat model to evaluate wildtype AdV pathogenesis in immunocompetent and cyclophosphamide-immunosuppressed animals, with two specific aims: Aim 1: To elucidate the mechanism of MAGI-1 activating peptide and AdV triggered proteolytic degra- dation of CAREx8. Completion of this aim will allow the identification and development of novel and much needed targets and approaches to prevent the infection and spread of pathogenic wild-type AdV and, in the future, group B coxsackieviruses. Aim 2: To define the protection afforded by MAGI-1 PDZ1 binding peptides against wild type adenovi- rus infection in cotton rats. Completion of this aim will provide proof-of-principle that AdV infection can be thwarted by reducing its primary receptor and may save lives of severely infected or immunosuppressed indi- viduals.  Overall impact: Understanding the mechanisms that regulate the expression and localization of CAREx8, and how this unique isoform mediates viral entry at the apical surface of a polarized epithelium is criti- cal for understanding viral spread, tissue tropism, and pathogenesis. The successful completion of the pro- posed aims will identify not only the cellular mechanisms regulating the expression of the apical adenovirus receptor but also mechanisms regulating viral binding and infection. This will establish the feasibility of thera- peutic agents that reduce the susceptibility of the airway epithelium to adenovirus infection and pathogenicity prior to infection and during an active infection in immunocompetent and immunosuppressed conditions. We ultimately expect the proposed aims to lead to novel anti-viral interventions that may also block other viruses that use CAR as a primary receptor, and provide insight into the regulation of other related viral receptors."
"9247601","MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have emerged as powerful regulators of the genome and, through concerted efforts to identify their function and evaluate their ability to alter cell growth in vitro and in vivo, some have gained favor as potential therapeutics. Although these miRNA-based approaches can revolutionize the way that tumors are diagnosed and treated, our understanding of the functional and the molecular aspects of miRNA biology are still incomplete. Moreover, in order to bridge miRNA biology with clinical utility, the challenges that still remain with regard to in vivo delivery of miRNAs must be tackled. To address these challenges we propose two Specific Aims: I. To enhance miRNA therapeutic efficacy through combinatorial miRNA-based targeting and molecular profiling and II. To develop and test second-generation vehicles for delivery of unprotected miRNAs.  Our extensive preliminary evidence supports both Aims. We recently identified 10 miRNAs out of 2,019 that significantly enhance the tumor suppressive activity of miR-34a, the first miRNA to enter into clinical trial, and have begun to identify the direct targets of these miRNAs to gain insight into the molecular reason for the cooperative effect. We used a novel method that relies on ligating the cellular miRNAs directly to their associated RNA target followed by deep sequencing of the RNA hybrids. The sequencing data from 13 libraries that we constructed will be used to identify the direct targets of these miRNAs, independent of current algorithms. Targets will be validated and evaluated for pathways that they associate with that will begin to explain their cooperative effect with miR-34a. We also propose to evaluate the in vivo efficacy of the combinatorial pairs using various models of lung cancer. Although we are committed to understanding how these miRNAs are cooperating with miR-34a we also propose to use this data to better understand miRNA biology at a global level. Thus, our data will be used to determine how miRNAs associate with their targets at nucleotide resolution, and how the target population changes with regard to miRNA concentration, which is extremely important to understand as miRNA clinical utility increases. In parallel we will develop and test a second-generation miRNA delivery vehicle, which is a first-in-class method for delivering miRNAs completely unprotected. Following systemic delivery using this method, the miRNA accumulates specifically in the tumor and is efficiently taken up by the tumorigenic cells as indicated by target gene repression with no obvious toxicity. Collectively, the data obtained from this work will validate in vivo efficacy for combinatorial miRNA therapeutics, and for the first time will provide evidence for unprotected miRNA delivery. We will also begin to break down the barriers regarding miRNA target identification that until now has been mostly approached using algorithms that lack critical parameters due to a gap in our understanding of how miRNAs bind their targets."
"9349490","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite being identified in the 1999 Institute of Medicine report 'To Err is Human' as a central facet of patient safety and quality improvement, diagnostic errors (missed, delayed or incorrect diagnoses) remain understudied and cause significant morbidity and mortality. Limited pediatric-focused research on diagnostic errors highlights the significance of the problem in children: 54% of pediatricians report making a diagnostic error at least monthly and 45% report making a diagnostic error that harms patients at least annually. Errors in diagnosis were the most prevalent cause in closed pediatric malpractice claims. Few studies investigate pediatric diagnostic errors and even fewer attempt to reduce them. This grant proposes to conduct a multisite, prospective, stepped wedge cluster randomized trial testing a quality improvement collaborative intervention within the American Academy of Pediatrics' Quality Improvement Innovation Networks (QuIIN) to reduce the incidence of pediatric primary care diagnostic errors. The proposal will focus on 3 specific, high-risk, ambulatory diagnostic errors each representing a unique dimension of diagnostic assessment: evaluation of symptoms (missed diagnosis of adolescent depression), evaluation of signs (missed diagnosis of pediatric elevated blood pressure) and follow-up of diagnostic tests (delayed diagnosis of actionable laboratory results). This proposal specifically responds to the AHRQ Special Emphasis Notice NOT- HS-13-009 designed to improve diagnostic performance in ambulatory care settings, and focuses on children, an AHRQ priority population. We will test whether a quality improvement collaborative, consisting of evidence- based best-practice methodologies, mini-root cause analyses, data sharing, and behavior change techniques, is associated with a reduction in these 3 specific diagnostic error rates in a randomized national group of pediatric primary care practices. This proposal will enhance the epidemiologic understanding of ambulatory pediatric diagnostic errors through baseline data collected from the quality improvement collaborative and the control group. This research will serve as a potential foundation for projects aimed at global reductions of pediatric diagnostic errors across settings and diagnoses."
"9566430","PROJECT SUMMARY The major objective of this exploratory/developmental R21 proposal is to gather preliminary data to validate the future testing of (-)-epicatechin (Epi) for the treatment of sarcopenia. One of the most notable and debilitating age-associated alterations is the progressive loss of fat-free skeletal muscle (SkM) mass and strength, a condition known as sarcopenia. Currently, only exercise is recognized as an effective intervention to counteract sarcopenia. Thus, the need to identify and validate, safe and novel pharmacological strategies to effectively treat loss of muscle mass and strength. Our recent studies in animals demonstrate that (-)-epicatechin (Epi), the primary flavanol present in cacao, enhances SkM structure/function to levels comparable to those triggered by exercise. Preliminary studies performed in young and senescent mice indicate that Epi treatment can significantly decrease SkM protein levels of myostatin while increasing those of follistatin and multiple indicators of oxidative capacity suggesting possible stimulatory effects on muscle mass. In a proof-of-concept study, five healthy subjects were provided Epi in capsules for 7 days and blood protein levels of myostatin and follistatin measured. Results indicate a significant increase in the ratio of follistatin/myostatin. We also performed pharmacokinetic studies of Epi in human subjects noting a lack of adverse effects confirming, published reports regarding its wide safety margin. Given these novel observations, it is reasonable to propose an exploratory clinical trial to serve as an initial foundation for future sarcopenia-related studies. We specifically hypothesize that ?Epi can increase SkM mass and/or oxidative capacity leading to enhanced muscle function. These effects will be evidenced in older subjects and be linked to reductions in muscle and blood levels of myostatin, increases in follistatin, markers of muscle differentiation and indicators of oxidative capacity.? We will pursue the following aims: Aim 1. To examine the effects of Epi treatment in older subjects (age 65-75) on SkM mass and function. Using a randomized, double blinded clinical trial, we will examine the effects of a 6 month treatment with Epi (versus placebo) on muscle mass and function. Aim 2. To examine the effects of Epi treatment in healthy older subjects on SkM blood and muscle levels of myostatin and follistatin, SkM oxidative capacity and regulators of differentiation. Biopsies of quadriceps muscle (Vastus Lateralis) will be collected at the beginning and at the end of the 6 month trial. Blood samples will be collected serially (every month) during the study. Using Western blots, we will compare muscle protein levels for the endpoints of interest. We will also determine myofiber cross-sectional area, fibrosis and fat infiltration. In blood samples, we will assay circulating levels of Epi (and related metabolites). Using ELISA kits we will measure blood levels of myostatin and follistatin and determine the time course of changes during treatment."
"9468660","Project Summary Integration of sensory signals is crucial for sensory processing in the brain. Rodent whisker somatosensory cortex (S1) provides a powerful system to study this, because neurons integrate tactile information across a discrete array of whiskers. S1 circuitry is well characterized, but tactile representation remains poorly understood. Most studies have focused S1 encoding of single-whisker deflections. This stimuli elicit low-probability spiking, relatively weak somatotopic tuning, and highly similar receptive fields and maps in thalamus and across cortical layers. This weak- redundant code suggests that S1 neurons may code for more complex stimuli than single-whisker deflections. My project tests whether S1 neurons code for multi-whisker stimuli, which are generated during natural whisker sensation. I propose that multi-whisker tuning is achieved by linear and non-linear integration and that multi- whisker features are represented in a novel topographic map in S1. Aim 1 describes past work in which I extensively characterized multi-whisker tuning to 2-whisker sequences, which represent a tractable and important subset of multi-whisker stimuli. I discovered that many neurons have strong spatiotemporal tuning for specific 2- whisker sequences at specific inter-whisker-deflection-intervals (?t). I found that a combination of linear and nonlinear mechanisms construct and enhance spatial selectivity, with prominent sublinear suppression of non-preferred stimuli. I also discovered principles governing ?t tuning and that it enhances spatial selectivity for 2-whisker sequences, thus defining general computations underlying multi-whisker integration In Aim2, I will use 2-photon Ca2+ imaging to determine the representation of 2-whisker sequences at the population level. While neurons in L2/3 of S1 are highly intermixed by single-whisker tuning (Sato et al. 2007, Clancy KB et al. 2015), I propose that discrete cortical columns will be apparent if receptive fields are defined in terms of 2-whisker sequences. My results suggest that the edges of each column will be defined by a ring of spatiotemporally selective neurons that form discrete borders between columns through sharp differences in ?t tuning. Also, by imaging many neurons simultaneously, I will test whether firing correlations between spatiotemporally selective and non-selective units provide a robust population level code for 2-whisker sequences. This will greatly strengthen our understanding of how S1 represents multi-whisker stimuli. In Aim 3, I plan to extend my study of active sensory systems by studying the role of motor circuits in perception during active sensation. Overall, my research plan will contribute significantly to understanding how the brain integrates sensory and motor signals to generate accurate percepts of the world."

Community health workers will be hired, trained  and supervised at the University of Illinois at Chicago and through a subcontract with the Southeast  Environmental Task Force (SETF). Community capacity will be supported through a series of formal and  informal educational programs, journal clubs, and discussions of community needs and research in progress.  The long term goal of the COEC is to decrease environmental exposures and improve the public health of  underserved populations in Chicago."
"9565788","Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a condition of cardiac arrhythmia with an estimated treatment cost of $6 billion/yr in the United States (CDC 2016). A serious consequence of AF is increased mortality due to stroke and thromboembolism; patients with AF are at 2-17 fold increased risk of stroke. Uncoordinated contraction of the atria results in poor blood flow, creating regions of turbulence or stagnation in the heart that are at risk for clotting. Thus, antithrombotic therapy is a critical consideration in patient management. Warfarin has been in use for many years, and more recently new drugs such as rivaroxaban (Xaralto®) have emerged; unfortunately, these systemically circulating drugs carry risk of major bleeding. Intracranial and intra-abdominal bleeding are among the dangerous side effects of currently used anticoagulants. Antithrombotic treatment requires careful balance between managing clotting while not inducing off site bleeding. Because it is believed the 90% of strokes in AF are due to clots originating from the left atrial appendage, we consider whether targeted delivery of anticoagulants to the atrium could reduce clotting with less risk of bleeding off site. Inflammation is emerging as a potential target for delivery of drugs to the atrium in AF because, in AF patients, inflammatory markers and immune cells are highly elevated in the left atrial appendage. This project proposes to validate sulfated- dextran-coated, iron oxide nanoparticle (SDIO) imaging agents, which also possess anticoagulant activity, for targeting anticoagulant activity to sites of inflammation in the atria in AF animal models. We hypothesize that SDIO will reduce atrial clotting without increasing systemic blood coagulation time. Preliminary data confirmed that SDIO could facilitate imaging of activated macrophages in inflamed carotid arteries. In addition, SDIO show anticoagulant activity in several in vitro assays. In the current work, the ability of SDIO to target inflammation in the atria will be validated in the thoracic aortic constriction (TAC) mouse model of atrial fibrillation, which experiences inflammation and clotting in the atria that reflects the human disease. Targeting of SDIO to inflamed atria will be determined by Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and Positron Emission Tomography (PET). The stability of SDIO will be quantified, as a stepping stone to understanding the potential for clinical translation. Finally the ability to reduce clotting in vivo, and effect on systemic coagulation will be determined in the thoracic aortic constriction (TAC) model. SDIO represent a class of agents that can be imaged and also possesses anticoagulant activity. The success of this project would validate a fundamentally different approach to anticoagulant therapy from Warfarin and other oral anticoagulants, by localizing anticoagulant agents to sites of inflammation rather than relying on maintaining a circulating dose of drug."
"9218899","The overall goal of this proposal is to understand the mechanism by which Raf Kinase Inhibitory Protein (RKIP) utilizes phosphorylation to switch between three functional states and regulates the cellular kinome. RKIP is the prototypical member of the Phosphatidylethanolamine Binding Protein (PEBP) family, which comprises more than 400 proteins that are evolutionarily conserved both in sequence and structure, spanning from bacteria to humans. In spite of its relatively small size (185 residues), RKIP plays a dual role as a suppressor of metastatic cancer and as a regulator of cardiac function. Importantly, its dysregulation can lead to disease states. In the kinase signaling cascades, RKIP functions both as sensor and effector. As an effector, RKIP modulates allosterically the activity of different kinases, depending on its phosphorylation state. Specifically, RKIP regulates key mammalian signaling cascades, including MAP kinase (MAPK) and G protein- coupled receptors (GPCRs). Phosphorylation by Protein Kinase C (PKC) switches RKIP function from inhibiting Raf/MAPK signaling to inhibiting G-protein-coupled receptor kinase (GRK2), thereby up-regulating the ß-adrenergic receptor (ß-AR) and its downstream target Protein Kinase A (PKA). While solid biological data are available, little is known about the molecular mechanisms. We now propose that RKIP functions via a novel regulatory mechanism, where phosphorylation of RKIP acts on an existing salt bridge and triggers an allosteric switch of function. As a sensor, RKIP responds to changes in the MAPK and PKA signal transduction pathways through an unknown mechanism. It has been hypothesized that RKIP would function as a simple two-state system, with RKIP binding to either Raf (RKIPRaf) or GRK2 (RKIPGRK2). However, compelling data from our lab indicate that RKIP adopts three discrete functional and conformational states. The additional, high energy intermediate state (RKIPKin) is the one responsible for the interaction with the kinase cascades. Based on our data, we propose a novel positive feedback loop, where kinases that are downstream of RKIP targets bind and phosphorylate the RKIPKin state. Phosphorylated RKIPKin (pRKIPKin) promotes further phosphorylation of RKIP triggering the phospho-switch. In this proposal, we will characterize the structures and functions of RKIP in its allosteric states, combining our expertise in biophysics and signal transduction. We will accomplish the following specific Aims: 1) Characterize the phospho-switch and the RKIPGRK2 state; 2) Characterize the nature and function of the allosteric switch to a high energy state; and 3) Test the effects of allosteric states defined by biophysical studies on RKIP function in cancer. Although the immediate goal is to understand the signaling role of RKIP, the concepts developed in this grant application will help understand a novel relationship between phosphorylation and allostery that will be of general importance in cell signaling and communication.   "
"9398916","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):      Stroke is a major cause of disability in veterans. Despite significant advances in stroke rehabilitation methods there continue to be substantial long-term disability. Additional research is required to develop new methods to facilitate recovery. We propose to delineate and modulate the neurophysiological offline processing and performance gains that appear to occur during the process of recovery (i.e. systems level neural processing and enhancements of performance that occur after the actual training has stopped). Based on our preliminary data, we will focus on the role of offline processing during sleep. More specifically, using multiscale electrophysiological techniques that monitor task-related activity at multiple resolutions, we propose to conduct studies that will both delineate how sleep enhances motor recovery after stroke as well as test how best to structure/modify sleep during rehabilitation. Our underlying hypothesis is that `offline neural processing' during sleep facilitates motor recovery. The main goals of this proposal are to: (1) delineate the stages of sleep that can promote motor recovery after training, (2) elucidate the neural processes that promote motor learning during sleep, and (3) test if optimization of sleep-dependent processing can be used to enhance recovery. Using long-term multi- scale electrophysiological recordings in rats, our preliminary data illustrates tht sleep in general, and non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep in specific, plays an important role in the consolidation of motor skills in both the non-injured and the injured motor system. Further,  we found a close link between `replay' of neural patterns formed during task-specific training and offline gains in performance. The specific underlying hypothesis of this proposal is that offline `replay' of neurons during NREM sleep is important for sleep-dependent long-term improvements in motor recovery after stroke. We propose the following aims: (1) Determine the optimal amount and type of sleep to induce short-term offline gains in motor performance after stroke; (2) Determine the electrophysiological correlates of NREM sleep- dependent offline processing in the stroke perilesional cortex after motor rehabilitation; (3) Determine if sleep-dependent processing can be used to actively enhance long-term motor recovery. Our proposed research has the possibility of discovering important knowledge about the network and the neurophysiological basis of motor recovery and can offer novel approaches for neuromodulation to enhance motor recovery after stroke."

The meeting will assemble leaders in the field, together with junior faculty, postdoctoral fellows, and graduate students, to discuss the latest advances that analyze organization and function of nervous systems on the level of neuronal circuits in a variety of organisms and systems.  Computation in neuronal circuits is perhaps the major unresolved problem in biology and provides a missing link between genes and behavior. We believe that the problem of such magnitude requires joint efforts among scientists working on different organisms and systems. Creating such synergy served as a motivation for starting this biannual meeting series. By now, this is a well-established and highly regarded meeting in the community, which has an unusual inter-species flavor and focus on circuit structure and function. By its very nature, research presented in the meeting is highly interdisciplinary as it brings together experimentalists, theorists, and researchers from a range of quantitative disciplines.  The meeting will include sessions on sensory transformations, circuit computations, internal states, learning, motor control, and advanced techniques in neural circuits. Each session will be chaired by a leading scientist in the field. Oral presentations will be given by distinguished invited speakers as well as by speakers selected from submitted abstracts by a steering committee comprised of the invited speakers. Selected speakers will include graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, and junior faculty, with the aim of maximal inclusion of young investigators and under-represented individuals. Of special importance are the two poster sessions, where many participants can present their work in an atmosphere conducive to informal discussion. The meeting will be of moderate size and we expect about 250 people to attend, the vast majority of whom will be presenting a poster or talk."
"9408971","Technical Abstract  As with many chemotherapeutic drugs, taxanes exhibit poor oral bioavailability; hence, they are administered intravenously (i.v.). This regimen results in significant toxicities, due to both the high drug dose and vehicle (Cremophore ELR) used. Attempts made to develop an oral chemotherapeutic, using liposomes and polymeric nanoparticles as carriers, have not made it to the clinic, due to their inherent limitations. In Phase I, 3P Biotechnologies proposed to develop a ?platform? technology for the oral delivery of chemo drugs and other therapeutics via bovine milk-derived nanoparticles known as exosomes. The Phase I specific aims were to (1) isolate and characterize milk exosomes; (2) prepare exosomal (Exo) formulations of the chemo drug, paclitaxel (PAC), and the plant therapeutic, withaferin A (WFA); and (3) show that Exo formulations enhance therapeutic responses while lacking toxicity. Phase I proved feasible based on the following findings: a) differential centrifugation of raw bovine milk provided exosomes; b) exosomes were taken up by cells in vitro and in vivo; c) Exo formulations of PAC (ExoPACTM), WFA (ExoWFATM), and other compounds were developed, which showed higher anti-proliferative, anti-inflammatory, and anti-cancer activities vs. the free drugs against lung cancer cells, both in vitro and in vivo; and d) milk exosomes lacked cross-species reactivity in wild-type mice. Additional data generated preliminary to Phase II showed that bovine colostrum powder produces exosomes with a yield and purity that are several-fold higher than can be obtained from fresh milk, resulted in significantly higher drug loading than milk, and that exosomes can be functionalized with folic acid for tumor targeting. In Phase II, a team of multidisciplinary researchers will advance this technology by pursuing the following specific aims: 1) Establish the reproducibility of colostrum exosome yield, maximize drug loading of the taxane PAC, identify and optimize loading of a tumor-targeting ligand, and test the resulting formulations for antiproliferative and anti-inflammatory activities against human lung cancer cells in vitro. 2) Determine the efficacy of Exo formulation of PAC (ExoPACTM) and functionalized-ExoPACTM for tumor targetability, minimizing off-target sites, using orthotopic xenograft, patient-derived tumor xenograft (PDX), and K-ras spontaneous tumors. 3) Determine toxicities of the ExoPACTM and functionalized-ExoPACTM formulations, analyze blood and tissue levels of PAC (PK/PD studies), and determine stability of the formulations. The innovation lies in the use of standardized colostrum-derived, functionalized exosomes for oral delivery for cancer therapeutics to circumvent bioavailability issues. The current taxane therapeutic market is dominated by a single product, Abraxane®, an i.v. albumin-PAC product. A product that performs similar to or better than Abraxane®, would potentially generate U.S. and worldwide markets of over $7 billion and $28 billion, respectively. If we are successful in achieving our objectives we will apply for Phase IIb, where we will establish large-scale production of ExoPACTM and will conduct Phase 1/2 clinical trials. Oncologists on the Advisory Board of 3P Biotechnologies will guide as we advance these drug formulations."
"9441075","Project Summary  The discovery of certain APOL1 gene variations in African Americans (AA) showed that these variants are a major reason for the development of chronic kidney disease (CKD). Indeed, certain APOL1 gene variants account for much of the striking increase in end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in AA compare to European Americans (EA). In addition, kidney transplants that have these same APOL1 gene variants have a two-fold increase for failure. Thus, it is important to understand how these APOL1 genes contribute to kidney transplant failure and find other factors that can increase or decrease the occurrence of such kidney failure. There is also a need to understand if certain APOL1 genes will affect the health of living AA kidney donors. The NIDDK APOLLO network is a critical step in generating the data needed to answer these important questions. We have assembled a network of multiple transplant programs in the Mid-Atlantic and a multidisciplinary team of investigators that will gather a large group of AA kidney donors and recipients to follow their health and kidney function over time, as well as build a kidney tissue, serum and urine biobank to provide a platform for promising additional future research.  The mechanisms of how certain APOL1 gene variants affect kidney function are not known. Accordingly, we propose to utilize state of the art ?omics? technologies such as RNA sequencing, exome sequencing metabolomics and epigenetics on the kidney biopsies, sera and urine samples to help discover how APOL1 gene variants cause kidney diseases. We will correlate the results of these tests with the health of the donors and recipients and the function of their kidneys.  We propose to test three primary hypotheses: 1.) Certain APOL1 gene variants in AA can activate pathways that lead to abnormal responses in kidneys, resulting in increased susceptibility to CKD in kidney donors; 2.) In kidney recipients, certain APOL1 gene variants can activate responses that lead to kidney injury and increased CKD and/or kidney transplant failure; and 3.) Certain APOL1 gene variants can stimulate abnormal kidney responses, leading to increased blood pressure and cardiac disease in donors or recipients.  To test these hypotheses we propose three aims: Aim 1: (a) Establish a large group of AA live kidney donors; (b) Establish a serum and urine biobank; and (c) Examine the relationship between APOL1 genes and kidney diseases. Aim 2: (a) Establish a large group of recipients of AA kidneys; (b) Establish kidney biopsy, serum and urine biobank; (c) Determine the relationship between APOL1 genes and transplant outcomes; (d) Examine the relationship of APOL1 genes and the pathology of the kidney biopsies; and (e) Use omics based methods to identify how APOL1 gene variants affect kidney outcomes. Aim 3: (a) Assess the relationship between of APOL1 gene variants and cardiac disease."

Our primary research question is: Will a multi-year, school-based prevention program, infused with professional development (PD) aimed at increasing the capacity of middle school teacher teams to engage their students in learning, yield changes in middle school students' health risk behaviors and academic outcomes that exceed outcomes from a school-based student-focused prevention program alone? The research has two primary aims:  Primary Aim 1: Conduct a pilot study to determine the feasibility and acceptability of a school-based, SEL+PD program (Positive Action plus teacher-team professional development and support) designed to reduce health risk behaviors (violence, bullying, substance use, sexual risk behaviors) and increase academic achievement among middle school students; and  Primary Aim 2: Implement a SEL plus teacher-team professional development program and evaluate its effectiveness on student outcomes compared to a SEL program alone.  We will evaluate the two conditions in a matched pairs, randomized trial involving approximately 840 students in 4 urban middle level schools across 3 school years."
"9396142","Project Summary/Abstract  Deficits in attention predict a diminished quality of life and are common in many neuropsychiatric conditions, including schizophrenia, depression, and addiction. The development of improved treatments for attentional dysfunction requires a better understanding of the neural circuitry underlying this fundamental cognitive process. Top-down or goal-directed attention involves the direction of cognitive resources to salient stimuli in accordance with an organism?s goals and expectations; this process is distinct from involuntary attention. Top-down attention deficits are notably characteristic of neuropsychiatric disorders. In top-down attention states, frontal cortices, such as the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) in mice, exhibit activity before the onset of visual cues. This anticipatory activity modulates sensory and association cortices, such as visual (V1/V2) and parietal association (PtA) cortices in mice. However, the neural circuits mediating this intercortical communication are poorly understood. Preliminary data in mice suggests 1) that the claustrum provides a functional link between ACC and PtA; and 2) that inactivating ACC ? claustrum afferent activity before the onset of a visual cue disrupts performance on a goal-directed attention task. Thus, we hypothesize that the ACC transmits top-down attention signals to the claustrum and that the claustrum propagates ACC input to distal cortical areas necessary for visual attention. To test this novel hypothesis in Aim 1, we use time correlated single photon counting-based in vivo fiber photometry in freely behaving mice to determine if ACC afferents to the claustrum are active during goal-directed attention. In Aim 2, we test if claustrum projection neurons to V1/V2 and PtA are faithfully driven by optogenetic ACC afferent stimulation to determine if the claustrum propagates incoming ACC signals to visual-processing cortical areas. Thus, this proposal utilizes state-of-the-art techniques for an unprecedented look at the circuits, physiology, and behaviors underlying the attention construct as defined by the National Institute of Mental Health Research Domain Criteria framework. Finally, this proposal outlines a rigorous training regimen for the development of an independent researcher, which includes the submission of multiple peer-reviewed publications, the frequent presentation of results at local, national, and international venues, and training in innovative techniques."
"9278044","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Project 5 ? The Role of Information Technology & Treatment Heterogeneity in Population Health This proposal seeks to better understand the underlying microeconomic drivers of physician use of information technology (IT), with a focus on the provision of preventive care and its downstream population health impacts. To do so, we will leverage unique, rich data on physician use of IT (at the second-by-second level) to assess patient eligibility for preventive care, linked to traditional data sources (e.g. claims), and quasi-random variation in incentives. We will incorporate methods from machine learning and econometrics to i) tractably characterize use of IT based on numerous potential patterns of use and ii) understand heterogeneity in impacts of IT using data- driven approaches to estimation. We will be able to study the average impact of IT on the provision of preventive care. In addition, we will use natural variation in which incentives were moved from measures of the process of preventive care ? screening for HbA1c level ? to intermediate health outcomes ? HbA1c levels under control. This will allow us to assess the impact of IT on physician and patient effort on preventive care as well as the impact on health itself. Our approach allows us to consider not only the mean impact of IT, but also the potential sources of its heterogeneous impacts on access and adherence to preventive care. For example, among diabetic patients, is the primary determinant of appropriate preventive screening whether the patient visits the doctor or, conditional on visiting the doctor, whether the physician provides appropriate screening? How do these margins for care depend on access to IT, and physician, patient, and treatment heterogeneity? These distinctions have important implications for designing interventions and incentives to improve health among the diabetic population ? and prevention more broadly. IT also has the potential to provide targeted individual-level information and treatment guidelines. Enhancing the scope of IT in this way could improve the effectiveness of targeted medical treatments in practice. However, how individuals and their doctors actually adopt IT and use it to respond to even simple guidelines is critical in assessing how to best disseminate patient-centered information and personalized treatment recommendations, with the primary goal of improving population health. We will identify the variance of health outcomes induced by a range of different medical treatments, in addition to the mean treatment impacts typically studied. We will use our results to assess the potential population health gains from IT-driven personalized treatment recommendations, informing policies designed to best use resources to improve the health care management and health of an aging population."
"9409553","Project Summary Over the past two decades, diabetic retinopathy (DR) has become the leading cause of adult blindness in the US, affecting 40% of all diabetic patients and resulting in $500 million a year in direct medical costs. Vision loss due to DR is largely preventable and can be reduced by up to 90% with appropriate eye screening. However, in the US, less than 50% of diabetic patients receive a recommended yearly eye exam due to many factors that include lack of access to eye care professionals. Distributed tele-ophthalmic screening thru primary care clinics can potentially provide all diabetic patients cost- effective, yearly evaluations to detect DR and prevent vision loss. However, gold-standard sensitive detection of DR using standard retinal photography is complex and cumbersome process requiring up to 7 images per eye. This screening process cannot for all practical purposes be achieved without having highly trained ophthalmic photographers. RetiVue proposes to develop the RetiVue DR in collaboration with Olympus, to create the first handheld, non- mydriatic, 160 field of view, widefield DR screening camera. It will allow single photo capture of an area up to ten times greater than conventional fundus cameras, allowing sensitive detection of DR at its earliest time points. Full integration of RetiVue and Olympus hardware will enable the most advanced and highest image quality handheld retina camera on the market. Use of automated alignment, auto laser focus, and auto image capture will allow complex imaging of the retina to be performed simply by positioning the iris, requiring no user knowledge of retinal anatomy. We have established clinical proof of concept with our patented technology, but require several additional innovations in optical design, automated image recognition, and retinal image processing to enable a commercial device. We will for this proposal optimize our alignment system and laser based focusing system for widefield imaging, allowing automated alignment and focus to image the retina before eye movement occurs. We will develop a new method of widefield, non-mydriatic peripheral retinal imaging using multiple LED slit-beam projectors to allow rapid, segmental, sequential image capture of 90°, 120°, and 160° FOV on diabetic patients. Finally, we will create the most advanced retinal image processing algorithms to remove Purkinje haze which prevents conventional cameras from imaging beyond 45° FOV and enable seamless stitching of segmental peripheral retina images into a single widefield image."

"9440911","An excess burden of chronic kidney and end stage renal disease is born by African Americans. Risk variants in the apolipoprotein-1 (APOL1) gene, found almost exclusively in individuals of African ancestry, are associated with several forms of non-diabetic kidney disease in African Americans, including focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, HIV-associated nephropathy, and hypertension-related kidney disease. These APOL1 risk variants explain up to 70% of the excess risk in African Americans developing these kidney diseases. However, presence of these risk variants does not guarantee development of kidney disease, with secondary genetic or environmental hits required. This along with lack of targeted therapies makes the value of genetic screening for APOL1 risk variants unknown. The impact of APOL1 risk variants in kidney transplantation, for both donors and recipients, is understudied. Kidney transplantation is the preferred treatment for end stage renal disease, affording significant survival, quality of life, and health economic advantages over chronic dialysis. It is unknown if living kidney donors with APOL1 risk variants are at increased risk for development of kidney disease post donation. For recipients, initial studies have suggested that recipients who receive donor kidneys with two APOL1 risk variants may have worse graft outcomes. Due to both biological and social- economic factors, African Americans have been historically disadvantaged in receiving kidney transplants, and the theoretical practice of APOL1 genetic screening and excluding donors with risk variants could further disadvantage this population. These multiple questions highlight the need to thoroughly examine the impact of APOL1 risk alleles on transplant outcomes. The NIH- sponsored APOL1 Long-term Kidney Transplantation Outcomes Network (APOLLO) will address this important question by uniting transplant centers, organ procurement organizations (OPOs), and the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) to enroll these donors and follow transplant outcomes. We propose to be an ideal clinical center in direct response to this request for application by accomplishing several aims. In Aim 1, we will recruit and retain 200 donor-recipient kidney transplant pairs for APOL1 genetic testing where donors are African American or mixed African ancestry and perform longitudinal clinical follow up of living donors and recipients to better understand the impact APOL1 donor status has on transplant outcomes. In Aim 2, we will further enrich the APOLLO objectives by meaningfully engaging patients through assessing local attitudes, priorities, and preferences regarding participant recruitment and APOL1 genetic testing using the novel method of Community Engagement Studios. This method is effective in recruitment and retention of minority participants. In Aim 3, we will determine genomic ?second hits? using advanced genomic analyses to determine what additional genetic variation beyond APOL1 genotype is associated with kidney function. Once completed, these Aims will advance our knowledge of APOL1 in kidney transplantation."
"9364793","Developing Patient-level Risk Prediction Models for Prescription Opioid Overdose Summary / Abstract Morbidity and mortality related to prescription opioid use and abuse are major clinical and public health problems. Reducing prescription opioid overdose rates requires efforts on multiple fronts aimed at reducing both patients? transition to long-term opioid use and their subsequent overdose risk. Prescription drug monitoring programs (PDMPs)?statewide electronic databases containing all controlled substance prescriptions and that clinicians can query in real time?are one promising tool for promoting safe opioid prescribing, but their full potential remains untapped. One reason for this is that most prior research has focused on patients? mean opioid dose, and has used either aggregate data or data restricted to specific health systems or insurers. Evidence derived from large, population-based, patient-level longitudinal data is needed to better inform national and state efforts to reduce prescription opioid-related harms. For example, high-dose opioid use is associated with greater overdose risk, but our preliminary data indicate that rate of opioid dose escalation is also an important and under-studied predictor of overdose risk. This proposal?s long-term goal is to lay the groundwork for multivariable PDMP-based risk prediction tools that clinicians and public health officials can use to assess overdose risk in the same way that Framingham-type tools are currently used to assess cardiac risk. The proposal?s overarching hypotheses are that rate of opioid dose escalation will be associated with both transition to long-term opioid use and incident opioid overdose, and that overall overdose risk will be concentrated in a relatively small group of high-risk patients. The objective of this proposal is to identify longitudinal opioid prescribing patterns associated with a) new opioid users? transition to long-term use (i.e., continual opioid use for >90 days), b) patients? incident fatal or nonfatal opioid-related overdose (including heroin overdose), and c) repeat overdose by analyzing longitudinal, patient-level prescribing and overdose data for all of California between 2008 and 2016. We will take the novel step of linking 3 statewide longitudinal databases at the patient level: prescribing data from California?s PDMP, death certificate data, and statewide hospital discharge and emergency department data. Mixed-effects regression methods for longitudinal data will be used to analyze associations between opioid prescribing patterns and proposal outcomes. Results from these analyses will be used to develop and prospectively validate clinical risk prediction models for each outcome. This project will produce validated risk prediction models derived from population-based, patient-level longitudinal data that will be used to build clinical risk prediction tools that can eventually be incorporated into PDMPs in order to inform prescribing decisions at the point of care. Results from California will also be useful to the 48 other states that have PDMPs. This project advances a research program aimed at developing and evaluating tools that clinicians can use to make safer opioid prescribing decisions, and that researchers and policymakers can use to design and evaluate clinical, public health, and policy interventions."
"9409020","Project Summary/Abstract Bacterial keratitis (BK) is an infection of the cornea that, if left untreated, can cause blindness. Staphylococcus aureus (Sa), Streptococcus pneumoniae (Sp), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Pa) are three major causes of BK in North America. Symptoms of BK include pain, redness, inflammation, and opacity of the affected cornea and loss of visual acuity (1). AmebaGone Inc., (AG) partnered with UW-Madison Department of Ophthalmology to develop a novel biocontrol method to treat BK. AG holds issued patents and has expert knowledge related to use of Dictyostelid cells (DC), a benign, soil- dwelling organism known to destroy pathogenic bacteria through the phagocytosis. Issued patents broadly cover the use of DC to eat biofilm-enmeshed and free-living (planktonic) bacteria (?Therapeutic Ameba and Uses Thereof?; USPTO granted patent 8,551,471 and follow up patent US 8,551,671). A patent covering countries of the European Union has been filed and the firm has licensed rights to more than 3,000 DC strains from 3 worldwide collections occupying diverse natural habitats. Benign DC diverged from aquatic amoeba, some of which are pathogenic, over 1 billion years ago. In Phase I work, AG identified 36 Dicty strains capable of efficiently killing (> 4 log10 reduction in bacterial titers) Sa at eye temperature. Of these strains, AG identified 4 DC strains that reproducibly germinated to high levels and developed a gel formulation that increased the maximum recovery time from 1 to 16 hours. Additionally, AG tested safety of these DC strains and found no increase in corneal pathology or discomfort compared to the vehicle control. In the Phase II project AG proposes to: 1) Expand the target of DC from singular action against Sa to additional causative agents of BK- Pa and Sp, 2). Develop effective formulation and assess DC stability therein. 3) Conduct in vivo safety and basic biology testing of DC treatment in the eye, and 4). Quantify efficacy of DC cocktails in treating murine cornea infected with Sa, Pa, or Sp in vivo. The data generated in these studies will position us to prepare an Investigational New Drug (IND) application for the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)."
"9341780","Project Summary ? Fauxsee Innovations, LLC The objective of this project is to assess the efficacy and usability of an electronic travel aid (ETA) called Roboglasses® (developed through an NSF SBIR grant) in reducing head and upper body injuries sustained by blind people who currently use a cane and/or guide dog for mobility. Canes and dogs only provide information about ground-level obstructions and existing ETAs are intrusive, convey limited information content, and require a steep learning curve to master. Our Roboglasses® solution provides a new approach to obstacle detection/ avoidance designed to address these shortcomings and improve the safety and efficiency of independent travel for blind users. Our approach uses a simple, hands-free solution that provides a new channel of haptic communication to convey environmental information to the user in an intuitive, silent, and easy-to-use manner. The Roboglasses® ETA, worn like a pair of sunglasses, frees the hands to use the dog, hold a cane or other object; it delivers detailed information about the location, distance and direction of obstacles using an unobtrusive haptic interface where learning is natural and intuitive, vs. requiring cognitive effort and prolonged training. As the sensing and delivery of haptic information is coupled to the head rather than the hand as is the case with other ETAs, it provides better perceptual coupling with distance/directional cues and more natural information related to the user's direction of movement. This project proposes to build four advanced models of the Roboglasses® ETA and conduct in-depth human trials with 20 totally blind adults to determine if the new ETA significantly improves protection of these users from head and upper body injuries during navigation. Additional experiments will refine interface parameters and usability characteristics to ensure the system is optimized for blind users and includes their input in the design process. Adopting this human-centered, iterative design approach is rare in ETA development but ensures that the end product is likely to be accepted and adopted by the target demographic. The experimental trials combine lab-based empirical procedures and qualitative user feedback based on meticulously planned testing environments. The environments use obstacles that mimic real-life hazards that frequently cause upper body and head injuries to blind people. An initial sequence of tests will be conducted to optimize interface usability and ensure adherence to good human factors design. ETA sensor data, video recording and behavioral performance on temporal and error measures, and survey responses will be analyzed and correlated to improve device design and for publication of results to advance ETA science. Two members of the research team are blind: Brandon Foshee, Fauxsee's president, and Dr. Nicholas Giudice, an expert in Orientation and Mobility techniques and assistive technology design. This first-hand phenomenology is lacking in most research and development efforts of assistive technologies but is critical for establishing user needs and for understanding what works and doesn't work in an ETA, insight that will guide all aspects of system design and evaluation."
"9270966","Program Director/Principal Investigator (Last, First, Middle): Thomas, Timothy K. Abstract  Back to Basics is a mixed-methods intervention trial to reduce the prevalence of obese Alaska Native children by increasing the proportion of nutrient-dense traditional and non-traditional foods consumed, and decreasing consumption of sugar sweetened beverages (SSBs). This 5-year intervention trial targeting 0-5 year olds is conducted in partnership with Rural Action Community Action Program, Inc. (RC) Head Start, Early Head Start, and Parents as Teachers programs in 12 rural Alaskan communities, where each site is assigned to either a 9-month nutritional education and meal program intervention or a standard education and meal program repeating annually.  Once a nomadic population that lived entirely off the land, river, and sea, Alaska Native people have experienced an abrupt nutritional shift towards greater consumption of store-bought manufactured foods and a more sedentary lifestyle. A recent study of dietary adequacy among Alaska Native women in western Alaska found that traditional foods accounted for only 17% of calories, but provided 34% of protein, as well as disproportionately large amounts of essential vitamins and minerals. SSBs were consumed more than any other dietary item and accounted for 8% of calories.45  Over the past three decades, childhood obesity has emerged as a serious public health problem, increasing three-fold across all races and ethnicities.1 Obesity is highest among Hispanic and Alaska Native/American Indian (AN/AI) children and adults, with 41% of Alaska Native children 2-5 years of age overweight or obese in 2009.4 Substantial evidence suggests that obesity in early childhood, ages 0-5 years, is a critical factor in the development of adolescent and adult obesity.2 Obesity, in childhood and adulthood, is a major risk factor for serious immediate and long-term life-threatening health conditions, such as glucose intolerance, hypertension, diabetes, and cancer.  Back to Basics has an unprecedented opportunity to incorporate the lessons learned through past research (Store Outside Your Door) and build on previous study designs and interventions (Hip-Hop to Health, Jr.) in implementing an effective intervention to improve dietary quality through promotion and reincorporation of traditional foods in at-risk young children and their families.17,38 A home-based nutrition education curriculum and Head Start center-based meal service focused on traditional foods, will serve as the foundation of the intervention. If effective, this strategy can be adapted and implemented by other Head Start programs across the state to further improve diet quality of all Alaska Native children.

It is a leading cause of sight-threatening blindness among adults with diabetes, with significant morbidity among those who need to manage early stages of this disease. It has lifelong consequences for those living with diabetes, and the financial burden of its treatment is immense. We propose to capitalize on the endogamous structure of the population in Chennai, India, to map common and rare susceptibility loci. We will leverage the existing infrastructure for standardized data collection, with multifaceted phenotyping of diabetic retinopathy, established by the SN DREAMS project at the Vision Research Center, in Sankara Nethralaya.

"9368243","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Dementia causes substantial burdens for patients, their caregivers, and health care systems. Recent and potential changes in health care policy indicate a shift towards reimbursement models that could sustain evidence-based dementia care. Currently, there is a wide gap between best practice in dementia and real- world care delivery. Scalable, effective, and patient-centered dementia care models that are aligned with trends in reimbursement reform are needed now. The Care Ecosystem is a dementia support program that combines elements of effective programs into a scalable model that could be successful in the new policy environment. Care is delivered via the phone and web by unlicensed Care Team Navigators, who are trained and supervised by a nurse, social worker, and pharmacist. Proactive care modules focus on caregiver support and education, medication consultation, support around medical, financial, and legal decisions, and behavior management. We are evaluating the short-term impact of the Care Ecosystem on psychosocial and economic outcomes in a randomized controlled trial, funded by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation. Patients and caregivers from rural and urban locales, with a range of socioeconomic characteristics, and cohorts of Spanish and Cantonese speaking persons are included. Short-term (6 month) results suggest benefit, and we expect that the greatest impact of our care program will be realized in the long term across all stages of dementia. This proposed project would continue the care and measurement in our existing cohort to determine the 5-year treatment effects and to characterize the patients and caregivers most likely to benefit. In Aim 1, we will evaluate the Care Ecosystem's effects on patient quality of life, time to nursing home placement, cost of care, and caregiver burden, depression, and health across the disease trajectory. In Aim 2, we will determine the differential treatment effects by rural/urban locale, household income, ethnic minority status, and by severity of behavioral symptoms, caregiver burden, and social isolation. In Aim 3, we will determine the effects of Care Ecosystem on end of life care among patients who die. By clarifying the impacts of this scalable dementia care program, our project would provide important guidance as health systems determine what dementia care services to provide and to which beneficiaries. In addition, results would provide a framework for caring for a diverse population of patients and caregivers across the care continuum."
"9390308","Project Summary Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is characterized by lack of expression of the estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2). Available chemotherapy for TNBC results in limited efficacy and significant toxicity. The majority of patients with metastatic disease do not survive beyond 3 years. Currently, no targeted therapies are available for TNBC, in part because it is a highly heterogeneous disease and because the molecular drivers for TNBC are not known. TNBC more frequently affects younger patients (< 50 years) and is twice as prevalent in African American women as compared to Caucasians. There is a need to understand the biology of TNBC at the basic genetic and epigenetic levels to be able to develop targeted therapies for individual patients. We have identified a cohort of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) that may be specific to TNBC in African American women. The proposed research is focused on understanding the function of these lncRNAs in TNBCs. We hypothesize that disparities in TNBC in the African American population may be explained, in part, by expression of non-coding RNAs and epigenetic alterations that are specific to this population. We propose that lncRNAs may play an important role in the initiation and progression of TNBC in this population through regulation of gene expression. This proposal, consisting of two Specific Aims, will powerfully harness the complementary expertise of a team of investigators with considerable experience in signal transduction, cell cycle control, gene regulation, and clinical aspects of breast cancer. In Aim 1, we will test the hypothesis that down-regulation of selected driver lncRNAs will significantly affect TNBC cell proliferation, cell cycle progression, survival, migration, and invasion in TNBC using in vitro models of this disease. In Aim 2, we propose to characterize the most promising lncRNAs using an animal model, in an effort to understand how they initiate and maintain the TNBC phenotype and the associated gene expression signature."
"9454613","Project Summary Obesity is a significant public health problem with an increasing prevalence in both adults and children. Obesity increases the risk for many comorbid disorders including sepsis and for sepsis-related complications. It is now well established that obesity is associated with a state of chronic systemic inflammation because many cells within adipose tissue have inflammatory properties. Critical illness is associated with adipose tissue remodeling and occurs even in the absence of obesity. There are two functionally and histologically different types of adipose tissue: white adipose tissue (WAT) and brown adipose tissue (BAT). WAT takes on a BAT phenotype in response to stressful stimuli (cold stress, burn injury), a process known as browning, and is characterized by an increase in uncoupling protein (UCP)-1. In BAT UCP1 is important for thermogenesis. Browning increases energy expenditure and oxygen consumption, confers protection from obesity and improves insulin sensitivity. Signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT3) is an important acute phase reactant in sepsis that also affects lipolysis so may be an important regulator of browning. The effect of obesity on the adipose tissue response to sepsis-induced critical illness has not been well explored. Data from our laboratory suggest that adipose tissue browning occurs in non-obese mice after polymicrobial sepsis but is impaired in obese mice. The long-term goal of our studies is to understand the mechanisms through which body fat, in normal and in excess, contributes to the altered immune response in sepsis-induced critical illness. The central hypothesis of our proposal is that during sepsis adipose tissue undergoes phenotypical and functional changes that facilitates recovery but this process is impaired in obesity. We plan to test our hypothesis and accomplish the objectives by completing the following three specific aims. In Aim 1 we will determine the functional contribution of adipose tissue in recovery during sepsis in obese and non-obese mice. In Aim 2 we will determine the contribution of STAT3 to the inflammatory and metabolic responses in obese and non-obese mice during sepsis. In Aim 3 we will determine whether adipose tissue from obese and non-obese children undergoes phenotypic changes consistent with browning during ex vivo endotoxin stimulation. The role that adipose tissue contributes to the systemic inflammatory response in obesity and in the absence of obesity during critical illness has not been explored and is the focus of our investigations. This is significant because understanding the mechanistic changes that occur in adipose tissue that can affect obese and non-obese subjects can lead to improved therapies for patients."
"9398749","ABSTRACT Every organism requires the ability to detect mechanical stimuli as it is a critical process to discriminate between environmental cues. Despite the fundamental advantages of somatosensation, little is known about the molecular regulation of this process. Recently, Piezo2 channels were discovered as the channels responsible of conducting rapidly-adapting mechanically activated (RA-MA) currents. These channels are highly expressed in primary sensory neurons in vertebrates (Dorsal Root Ganglion (DRG) neurons) and their combined deletion in Merkel cells and DRG neurons abolishes light touch in mice. RA-MA Piezo2 currents are enhanced by inflammatory signals involving a PKC dependent mechanism as well as cAMP dependent mechanism via EPAC; pathways which have been linked to mechanical hyperalgesia, one of the symptoms of chronic pain described as painful responses to innocuous stimuli. However, the mechanisms that regulate this process are still poorly understood. Recent data from our lab shows that activation of Transient Receptor Potential Vanilloids 1 (TRPV1) channels by capsaicin leads to inhibition of RA-MA Piezo2 currents in DRG neurons. This inhibition is abolished by performing similar experiments in Ca2+ free solution, implying an essential role of Ca2+ in the regulation of mechanically activated currents, but how Ca2+ regulates mediates the inhibition of Piezo2 currents is not fully understood. Our preliminary data shows that inhibition of Ca2+/ calmodulin (CaM) activated protein kinases alleviates this inhibition. In addition, we have also found that activation of G-protein coupled receptors (GPCR-s) sensitizes Piezo2 currents. We hypothesize that the Ca2+ influx through TRPV1 channels promotes the activation of Ca2+-dependent intracellular pathways such as Ca2+/ CaM activated kinases thus inhibiting Piezo2 channels while activation of GPCR-s sensitize Piezo2 currents by activation or direct binding of a G-protein. We aim to investigate the role of Ca2+ and GPCR signaling in the regulation of mechanoreceptors and dissect specific molecules and proteins that can potentially serve as a basis for the development of new drug targets for the treatment of mechanical-pain syndromes."
"9358694","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Comparative effectiveness research (CER) particularly that which focuses on patient-centered outcomes research (PCOR), has the potential to provide patients and providers with valuable information on what treatments and interventions best address specific clinical situations and priorities. While our institution has a great deal of experience in health services research, this work has tended to focus on traditional measures, such as presence or absence of a particular clinical event, physiological measures, and test results. While some investigators at the Indiana University School of Medicine (lUSM) and Indiana University Health (Lu Health) have included patient-centered outcomes in their research, patients' experiences and evaluations of their own outcomes are not a priority in most of our research. Additionally, our pediatric health services    research has been targeted at the general pediatric population, ignoring the great need for work in    subspecialty areas. Therefore, the specific aims of this proposal are to: (1) Build infrastructure o expand our research capacity into pediatric subspecialties, (2) Establish a rigorous research program that is focused on patient-centered outcomes and CER, (3) Build capacity and training for faculty who will engage in CER/PCOR in pediatric subspecialties, and (4) Develop methods for incorporating findings into the larger health care system. In order to achieve these specific aims, we will establish the Center for Pediatric Comparative Effectiveness Research at lUSM and lU Health. This Center will be comprised of four Cores (i.e., Faculty Mentorship/Development, Patient Engagement, Informatics, and Implementation Sciences) that will function together in a collaborative, integrated fashion for the development and conduct of CER/PCOR as well as the implementation and dissemination of effective, evidence-based practices. Our vision is that CER/PCOR in the center will be conducted across all pediatric subspecialty disciplines at lU Health. The environment in which we will establish the Center is ideally suited for achieving our specific aims, and active collaborations with existing organizations, resources, and leaders within lUSM and lUH will significantly increase the likelihood of success and sustainability for our efforts in the Center."
"9444086","This International Research Scientist Development Award (IRSDA) from Rhode Island Hospital and Partners In Health-Peru will serve as a vehicle for the candidate, a pediatrician with advanced training in tuberculosis (TB), to become an independent physician-scientist in global health research. The candidate?s long-term goal is to improve outcomes for adolescents with TB by building an adolescent TB clinical research program in Peru. Of note, TB is one of Peru?s six national priority areas for biomedical research. This IRSDA will address the lack of evidence on adolescent-specific risk factors for poor TB treatment adherence. The three specific aims of this study will culminate in the derivation and validation of a clinically applicable prediction rule that identifies adolescents at risk for poor adherence to therapy for drug-susceptible pulmonary TB. Poor adherence will be defined as failure to complete the six-month regimen within nine months. The two parts of Aim 1 will lead to the development of a data collection tool to capture predictors of adherence. In Aim 1a, the research team will conduct 70 in-depth interviews with adolescents, parents, and health providers to explore perspectives on barriers and facilitators to adolescent adherence to TB treatment. In Aim 1b, the candidate, informed by these interviews, will develop a two-part data collection tool?consisting of a 20- minute structured survey and a brief chart abstraction from?that captures predictors of adherence. In Aim 2, the research team will administer the data collection tool to 400 adolescents who recently completed or defaulted from TB therapy. Using these data, the candidate will apply regression analysis to derive a clinical prediction rule for poor adherence, and then derive a second prediction rule using recursive partitioning. In Aim 3, these prediction rules will be externally validated in a prospective cohort of 400 newly diagnosed adolescents. The area under the receiver operator curve for each model will be measured against the outcome of poor adherence, which will be assessed at the end of therapy. The more accurate rule will be selected as the final model and will be incorporated into the candidate?s R01 proposal?which she will prepare in Years 4 and 5 of this IRSDA?to develop novel approaches to optimize adolescent adherence to therapy for TB disease.  In parallel with this research plan, the candidate will take courses in epidemiology, biostatistics, clinical prediction modeling, adolescent health, advanced qualitative analysis, the conduct of international clinical translational research, and grant writing. She will also receive instruction in these areas from an experienced mentorship team.

"9158774","Project Summary The unfolded protein response (UPR), a well-known adaptive mechanism for cells to maintain ER homeostasis, has been implicated in the pathogenesis of a variety of human diseases. Genetic deletion of the UPR signaling components can significantly influence the disease progression in mouse models for diabetes, hepatic steatosis, IBD, ALS and other diseases. We have recently performed a synthetic biology screen to interrogate the mammalian UPR pathway. From this screen, we have identified RtcB as a long sought RNA ligase that catalyzes unconventional XBP-1 splicing during ER stress. RtcB is a multifunctional RNA ligase that also acts in tRNA splicing. Genetic rescue of RtcB knockout cells suggests that RtcB-mediated ligation of XBP1 and tRNA may occur at different subcellular compartments. We will therefore determine subcellular compartment-specific RtcB function. By generating Trpt1 and RtcB double knockout cells and performing genetic rescue, we further demonstrate that a second biochemically distinct RNA ligation pathway cooperates with RtcB in mammalian cells to regulate XBP1 and tRNA splicing. Therefore, we will examine the role of other putative components in the RNA ligation pathway. Lastly we will identify unknown RNA ligases of the new ligation pathway by a genetic suppressor screen using RtcB knockout cells. By revealing the complete molecular repertoire of RNA ligation pathways, we will hopefully gain new insights and uncover new therapeutic targets to modulate the mammalian UPR."

"9444124","Project Summary Working memory, the ability to temporarily hold multiple pieces of information in mind for manipulation, is central to virtually all cognitive abilities. R? ecent technical advances have opened an unprecedented opportunity to comprehensively dissect the neural circuit mechanisms of this ability across multiple brain areas. The task to be studied is a common form of decision-making that is based on the gradual accumulation of sensory evidence and thus relies on working memory. ?A team of leading experts propose to investigate the neural basis of this behavior using the latest techniques, including virtual reality, high-throughput automated behavioral training, l? arge-scale cellular-resolution imaging ?in behaving rodents, manipulation of neural activity in specific brain areas and cell types, and a? utomated anatomical reconstruction?. In particular, the researchers will i? dentify key brain regions that are required for this decision task through systematic, temporally specific inactivations via optogenetics technology, across all of dorsal cortex and in key subcortical areas, and use quantitative model-fitting to evaluate the effects. They will use state-of-the-art ?two-photon calcium imaging? methods and electrophysiology to characterize the information flow in many individual neurons within these brain areas during the task. In addition, they will use cutting-edge anatomical reconstructions and new functional connectivity methods, within and across brain regions, to evaluate the interactions of these physiologically characterized neurons. ?The long-term goal of this project is to arrive at a complete, brain-wide understanding of the cellular and circuit mechanisms of activity dynamics related to working memory. ?Finally, they will use sophisticated computational methods to incorporate this new understanding into a realistic circuit model that will support a tightly integrated process of model-guided experimental design, in which the model suggests the most informative experiments and their results are then fed back to improve the model?s fidelity. ?This process is expected to produce? the most accurate and detailed multi-brain-region biophysical circuit model of a cognitive process in existence?. ?In addition, the proposed research will enable researchers to generate and test a variety of hypotheses about the neural basis of evidence accumulation, working memory, and decision-making. Taken together, these achievements will represent a crucial step toward a mechanistic understanding of how the brain works with information."
"9565807","Project Summary Stroke is a devastating complication of sickle cell anemia (SCA) that will occur in ~11% of all patients without intervention. In pediatric patients with SCA, most of these strokes are ischemic and strongly linked with arterial vasculopathy. There is a strong heritable component that affects development of stroke in SCA patients. However, our understanding of the genes involved is limited. Our group recently completed an unbiased genome wide association study of stroke in SCA using whole exome sequencing. We identified and validated two particular missense mutations in the GOLGB1 (Y1212C) and ENPP1 (K173Q) genes as protective against stroke in SCA. Our study goal is to define the functional role of GOLGB1 and ENPP1 as modulators of vascular endothelial injury and ischemic stroke risk.  We have previously observed that: a) GOLGB1 levels affect Golgi structure in monocytes and endothelial cells; b) The GOLGB1 Y1212C variant is associated with more compact Golgi in monocytes isolated from SCA patients; and c) ENPP1 influences platelet aggregation on vascular surfaces. From this preliminary data, we hypothesize that 1) GOLGB1 affects Golgi structure, which in turn regulates secretory output of pro-thrombotic factors such as von Willebrand factor (vWF) that can affect stroke in SCA; and 2) that ENPP1 affects risk of thrombosis either directly via platelet aggregation or indirectly through hydrolysis of the pro-inflammatory ADP. We plan to test these hypotheses by analyzing the function of GOLGB1 and ENPP1 in samples from patients with SCA. We will isolate primary monocyte and endothelial cells from a large cohort of SCA patients receiving care at Texas Children?s Hospital. We will test our central hypotheses by pursuing three aims: Aim 1: Examine role of GOLGB1 in form and function of Golgi complexes in sickle cell anemia - We will use high resolution imaging to determine the role of GOLGB1 in maintaining Golgi structure and protein trafficking in monocyte and endothelial cells from SCA patients; Aim 2: Determine the effect of ENPP1 activity in sickle cell anemia - We will test whether ENPP1 modulates platelet aggregation and thrombus formation in patients with SCA. We will measure plasma and endothelial activity of the ENPP1 enzyme; Aim 3: Determine effects of GOLGB1 and ENPP1 in a microfluidic in vitro model of vasculature - We will combine RNA expression and proteomic profiling to identify endothelial pathways affected by our candidate genes.  Our proposed studies will characterize the functional impact of our two genes and their genetic variants in SCA patient samples. This will benefit our understanding of the pathophysiological pathways of stroke and potentially provide targets for drug therapy to prevent or treat stroke in SCA patients."
"9310197","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Primary open angle glaucoma (POAG) is a leading cause of irreversible blindness worldwide. This project's long-term goal is to develop more effective clinical therapy through the discovery and improved understanding of glaucoma pathogenesis. We want to learn how to modify underlying disease mechanisms to an extent that it significantly alters the natural course of disease, preserves vision, and positively impacts patients' lives. This is particularly important in dealing with a chronic, unrelenting disease such as POAG. POAG is of unknown cause, although clinical features and risk factors are known: intraocular pressure (IOP), increasing age, corneal thickness and retinal ganglion cell loss. Levels of transforming growth factor-2 (TGF?2) in the aqueous humor are elevated and can be considered an important disease biomarker. This can affect the trabecular meshwork's function of regulating physiological aqueous outflow and IOP by inducing fibrogenic change and excessive contractility. Resulting rising IOP damages the retinal ganglion cells, optic nerve and vision. Current IOP-lowering glaucoma therapy targets physiological mechanisms of IOP regulation rather than underlying pathological mechanisms responsible for causing IOP to rise in the first place. We cannot therapeutically target these pathological mechanisms mainly because we do not know what the primary problem is. We have discovered that a mouse with a fibrillin-1 genetic mutation uncannily mimics salient clinical and biochemical features of human POAG. The genetic defect of the mouse immediately invokes pathogenic mechanisms related to fibrillin-1. It offers a unique opportunity to better understand and treat this mysterious and important disease. We propose the following specific aims to: (1) characterize the source of elevated aqueous TGF?2; (2) assess routes of TGF?2 activation in the eye tissues and aqueous humor; and (3) test a strategy to prevent harmful effects of aqueous TGF?2 on the trabecular meshwork and IOP that damages retinal ganglion cells. The mouse model will allow us to better understand the basis for aqueous TGF?2 elevation in POAG and test a treatment strategy to ameliorate development and progression of the disease."
"9536603","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The SEARCH for Diabetes in Youth Study documented a 31% increase in the prevalence of type 2 diabetes (T2D) between 2001 and 2009, as well as an increase of 21 % in the prevalence of type 1 diabetes (T1D) in youth diagnosed at age<20. Increases occurred across most but not all major subgroups of age, sex and race/ethnicity. Further, we documented an annual increase in the incidence of T1D among non-Hispanic white youth of approximately 2.7% per year. In contrast, studies from Europe suggest that incidence of T1D may be stabilizing. Ongoing, efficient surveillance of diabetes diagnosed in youth is essential to inform health care systems and generate testable hypotheses related to the natural history of diabetes in youth. SEARCH is uniquely positioned to address these critical questions through continued surveillance of childhood diabetes employing our well-established infrastructure for surveillance, and our highly experienced, collaborative and multi-disciplinary investigative team. Therefore, in response to RFA-DP-15-002, Component B, we propose the continuation of the SEARCH for Diabetes in Youth Registry Study (SEARCH Phase 4) during which we will continue to serve as the Coordinating Center (CC). Our approach is informed by our substantial accrued experience that allows us to provide statistical and operational leadership in a highly efficient manner. The overarching aim of the CC is to support the population based registries of Component A described in the RFA, specifically the activities of the surveillance network and the validation of diabetes cases. The main objectives of the registries are to ascertain, among youth diagnosed at age < 20 years, cases of prevalent diabetes in calendar year 2017; ascertain newly diagnosed (2015-2020) incident diabetes cases; confirm classification of diabetes type using biochemical markers; and optimize efficiency of the surveillance activities through targeted projects designed to utilize relevant electronic health data. The main objectives of the CC to support the surveillance network are to: (1) Maintain a central data repository and create protocols and mechanisms to secure transmission of data and relevant data management reports between the CC and the registry sites; (2) Ensure the training and certification of staff on measurements and procedures as outlined in the protocol and manual of operations; (3) Provide expertise and leadership in population-based surveillance development, methodology, implementation, and evaluation; (4) Provide statistical and other analytic support to the registry network; (5) Provide for a central laboratory for the analysis of biological specimens; (6) Provide operational support to the registry network (communication and meetings). The main objectives of the CC to support the validation of diabetes cases are to: (1) Develop analytic methods for case validation; (2) Provide statistical/analytic support for validation analysis; (3) Maintain diabetes case validation protocols. Thus, the CC is uniquely positioned to provide leadership in statistical and operational issues that will support continued collection of data on the prevalence, incidence and early clinical course of diabetes in youth."
"9453901","Unintended pregnancy is a persistent public health challenge in the U.S. Women who have had a recent pregnancy are at increased risk of unintended pregnancy compared to other women of reproductive age not using contraception, with rates up to 44% in the first postpartum (PP) year. In addition, adequate birth spacing in the postpartum period is important for both the health of the mother and the infant. Pregnancies with a short interpregnancy interval have been associated with increased risk of preeclampsia, preterm birth, and low birth weight. Low-income women of color are at increased risk of unintended pregnancy and inadequate birth spacing which in turn increases their risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes. Improved access to timely health care and contraception in the postpartum (PP) period is needed to reduce unintended pregnancies and help women achieve desired birth spacing. While the PP visit has historically been considered to be the place for women to discuss and receive contraception, many women, particularly low-income women, do not attend the PP visit. A novel approach to increasing receipt of PP care and contraception is the adoption of a reproductive life planning. Explorations of the use of a self-administered Reproductive Life Plan Tool (RLPT) by pediatricians in the context of the Well-Baby Visit (WBV) with postpartum mothers, holds great promise. The objective of the proposed study is to determine whether use of a simple self-administered Reproductive Life Plan Tool at the 2-month WBV increases the proportion of postpartum women receiving woman's health care and contraception at 6-months PP, compared to women not exposed to such an intervention. The two specific aims of the project are: Aim I. To determine if introducing a self-administered Reproductive Life Planning Tool (RLPT) with postpartum mothers during the 2-month WBV will increase the proportion of women receiving a well-woman primary care health visit by 6 months postpartum. Aim Ia. To determine if introducing a self-administered Reproductive Life Planning Tool (RLPT) with postpartum mothers during the 2-month WBV will increase utilization rates of contraception by 6 months postpartum. Aim II: To assess patient-, provider-, and systems-level barriers and facilitators to integrating a self-administered Reproductive Life Planning Tool designed to facilitate referral of postpartum women for primary well-woman care in the context of a pediatric clinic. If successful, the results of this study have great potential to inform clinical and public health practice to increase women's use of health care and contraception in the postpartum period."

"9469137","PROJECT SUMMARY  The Gordon Research Conference (GRC) on ?Thalamocortical Interactions: Development, Function & Dysfunction of Thalamocortical Networks? will involve roughly 150 scientists of diverse expertise assembled to discuss and debate new findings related to the functioning of thalamus and cortex and their interactions. The conference will take place at the Renaissance Tuscany Il Ciocco, Lucca (Barga), Italy, during February 18-23, 2018. The meeting will include a series of 20 minute talks followed by 10 minute discussion periods plus time each day for less formal interactions at poster sessions. This GRC will offer a unique combination of features, including: breadth of research; cutting-edge emphasis; mingling of investigators from all ranks and diverse sub- fields and locales; and intimate size and extended discussion time, allowing for close and sustained interactions. The program of this GRC emphasizes development, function and dysfunction of thalamocortical interactions, and builds on these to explore their roles in cognition and neuronal disease states. This GRC represents a rare opportunity for neuroscientists interested in thalamocortical interactions to exchange new results, hypotheses, and ideas at many levels, from cellular through systems to cognitive and clinical. This is especially timely, because this field has been expanding significantly with the recent appreciation that thalamus plays an ongoing and critical role in cortical functioning, and newly described deficits in such disorders as schizophrenia, epilepsy, and autism appear to have at least partly a thalamocortical locus. We thus fully anticipate this GRC to significantly advance the field and potentially offer new insights into certain clinical conditions."
"9352302","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Providers' improved access to electronic patient information through health information exchange is a national policy priority and a key infrastructure requirement for the US health care system. Thanks to significant public investments, providers have access to different health information exchange approaches to meet their information needs. One approach is referred to as ?pull,? which allows providers to query community-wide, longitudinal patient records. A second approach is ?push,? where key information, such as test results, is automatically delivered to providers. Unfortunately, there is a lack of evidence of the effectiveness of either the ?push? and/or ?pull? approach in primary care. Furthermore, which approach to sharing information best fits into primary care is also unknown. Despite the lack of evidence, federal policy encourages the exchange of patient information based on the assumption that the two approaches are equivalent. The objective of this proposal is to address these shortcomings in the evidence-based by clarifying the relationship between ?pull? and ?push? health information exchange usage in primary care settings and by determining the impact of each approach on potentially avoidable and costly health care utilization. Aim 1, Determine whether primary care providers use ?push? and ?pull? as complementary or alternative approaches to health information exchange, leverages a novel dataset of individual provider and staff behavior tracked within an electronic health record system combined with detailed measures of ?push? and ?pull? health information exchange usage. These data furnish a complete, detailed temporal sequence of providers' behavior revealing how each approach to health information exchange is used during a patient visit. Aim 2, Quantify the effect of ?push? and ?pull? health information exchange on potentially avoidable health care utilization, tests the hypothesis that health information exchange usage will be associated with reductions in readmissions and hospitalizations for ambulatory care sensitive conditions. This hypothesis will be tested among patients attributed to a 7-year, retrospective panel of more than 240 ambulatory physicians. The differential timing of implementation will be used to identify the effect of ?push? and/or ?pull? with a regression model that includes physician and year fixed-effects. This approach allows physicians to serve as their own controls eliminating unmeasured time-invariant confounding. This proposed analysis of secondary data is significant because the US has invested billions on interoperable health information technologies, but there is very little evidence of health information exchange's effects on utilization and on how it is used in primary care practice. This proposal is innovative because it will be the first to examine the impact of ?push? and ?pull? health information independently, and jointly, in primary care. This combination goes beyond existing research to accurately reflect current approaches to health information exchange available to physicians and supported by health information technology policy."
"9456040","During many chronic viral infections, virus-specific CD8 T cells become exhausted as a result of prolonged antigenic and inflammatory stimulation. Exhausted CD8 T cells are characterized by a progressive loss of the ability to produce effector cytokines and kill target cells, poor proliferative capacity, and increased expression of multiple inhibitory receptors. T cell exhaustion was first characterized in the murine model of lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) infection. Considerable effort has been focused on elucidating the mechanisms that regulate T cell exhaustion, with multiple factors and pathways implicated. Blockade of the PD-1:PD-L1 inhibitory pathway early during infection can prevent progression of CD8 T cell exhaustion and, if given at later time points, can partially rescue the function of exhausted CD8 T cells. Recent results show that PD-L1 blockade does not reinvigorate all exhausted CD8 T cells but selectively expands a subset of exhausted CD8 T cells into effectors that function only temporarily, reverting back to the exhausted state. Even when removed from the chronic infection environment, exhausted CD8 T cells are unable to differentiate into functional memory, indicating that the functional defects are molecularly imprinted within exhausted T cells. Our recent work has shown that progressive loss of CD8 T cell functionality during chronic LCMV infection is associated with decreased diacetylated histone H3 (diAcH3) levels globally and at specific loci encoding effector cytokines, indicating a loss of open chromatin structure at these loci. In vitro treatment of exhausted T cells with valproic acid (VPA), a histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi), restores diAcH3 levels and effector cytokine production. Remarkably, when adoptively transferred into naïve hosts, VPA-treated ?exhausted? CD8 T cells exhibit improved functionality for an extended period of time and differentiate into functional memory T cells with enhanced recall responses. Together, these results show that epigenetics plays a crucial role in regulating T cell exhaustion and may hold the key to reprogramming exhausted T cells into functional effectors capable of clear chronic infection. In this application, we will test 1) if adoptive transfer of exhausted CD8 T cells that have been rescued by in vitro HDACi treatment will work in vivo to clear an established chronic LCMV infection, and 2) if direct treatment of chronically infected mice with HDACi in vivo can rejuvenate exhausted CD8 T cell and allow for viral clearance. We will examine how exhausted T cells are reprogrammed epigenetically and transcriptionally by HDAC inhibition to understand the mechanisms of HDACi in rescuing exhaustion. We will test whether HDACi can reprogram and rescue subsets of exhausted CD8 T cells that fail to respond to PD-L1 blockade. We will examine if combining PD-L1 blockade with epigenetic manipulation synergizes to restore the functionality of all exhausted CD8 T cells and achieve faster viral clearance. Through these studies, we hope to gain a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying T cell exhaustion and to develop an optimal strategy for enhancing immune control and clearance of chronic viral infection."
"9398698","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Over 180,000 men will be diagnosed with localized prostate cancer in 2016 and 92% of these men will have localized or regional disease. Fortunately, treatment with curative intent (surgery or radiation with/without hormone therapy) provides long-term cancer-free survival. However, survivors experience urinary, sexual, bowel and hormonal symptoms, general distress, pain, fatigue, and sleep disturbance. For men in an intimate relationship, these symptoms disrupt couple?s relationships and intimacy, and reduce quality of life (QOL) of both patients and their partners who are often their primary caregivers. Symptom effects may have as great or greater impact on their partners? QOL than on patients? own QOL. Management of the negative effects of cancer and its treatment is a significantly under-addressed supportive care need for these men and their intimate partners. Most existing online programs are not couple-focused or use generalized ?one-size fits all? approaches that have fallen short of improving QOL. Existing in-person couple-focused programs are expensive and inconvenient because of the time and travel required. To address these unmet supportive care needs, Dr. Song led an interdisciplinary team to develop and pilot test the usability and feasibility of an evidence-based, couple-focused, tailored mobile health (mHealth) intervention, ?Prostate Cancer Education & Resources for Couples? (PERC). Based on the adapted stress-coping theoretical framework and developed with stakeholder involvement, PERC aims to improve QOL for both patients and partners through enhancing positive appraisals, self-efficacy, social support, and healthy behaviors for symptom management. Using mHealth technologies, PERC provides comprehensive, user-friendly content, and uses tailoring and personalization features designed to increase personal relevance of, and couples? accessibility to PERC modules. We propose to rigorously test the efficacy of PERC using a population-based, geographically and demographically diverse cohort in a randomized controlled trial. The specific aims are: Primary Aim: Assess if patients and partners receiving PERC will report greater improvement in their cancer-related QOL scores than those in the control group (usual care plus the National Cancer Institute (NCI) prostate cancer website) at 4, 8, and 12 months post-baseline. Secondary Aim: Test if patients and partners in PERC will report significantly more positive appraisals and higher levels of coping resources at follow-ups than those in the control group. Exploratory Aim: Determine if patient race and ethnicity, education, type of treatment, or couples? relationship quality moderate the effects of PERC on patient and partner QOL at follow-ups. This study will provide a novel model for self-managing chronic illness symptoms that impact couples? relationships, intimacy, and QOL. It addresses the National Institute of Nursing Research?s (NINR) goal to develop and test new strategies for symptom self-management to help patients and caregivers better manage their illness and improve QOL. It also responds to calls for programs from the Institute of Medicine (IOM) and American Cancer Society (ACS) to address treatment-related effects and improve survivors? QOL.  "
"9387922","Project Summary/Abstract There is a critical unmet need for the application of new therapies to treat dry eye disease. A true aqueous- deficient dry eye due to inefficient lacrimal gland (LG) function is among the most common and debilitating clinical outcomes. Unfortunately, dry eye has no cure, and current treatment options target symptoms rather than resolving disease. A potential regenerative approach for restoring lacrimal function is stem cell therapy, where autologous stem/progenitor cells are transplanted into the injured organ or stem cells within the tissue are reactivated. However, to achieve this goal, we must identify LG stem/progenitor cells and understand how they are regulated. Our first objective is to resolve how nerves regulate LG homeostasis and regeneration by characterizing potential progenitor cells and determining how nerves control their differentiation into functional glandular tissue. Parasympathetic nerves regulate epithelial progenitor cells in other glandular systems, and are essential to the maintenance of lacrimal tissue. Yet, despite reduced innervation being a component of dry eye, the impact of nerve alterations on lacrimal gland homeostasis and repair (or on progenitor cells) is not known. Based on our preliminary data strongly suggesting the parasympathetic-nerve derived neuropeptide Y (NPY) is altered in patients with aqueous deficient dry eye disease (GWAS) and controls LG morphogenesis and tissue maintenance, we will test the hypothesis that NPY signaling regulates LG formation, homeostasis and regeneration by controlling stem/progenitor cell behavior. Our prediction will be addressed through 2 specific aims that seek to: 1) Define how NPY signaling regulates LG progenitor cells during development; and to 2) Determine the contribution of acinar progenitors and NPY signaling to adult LG homeostasis and regeneration. These aims will be achieved using a combination of human lacrimal glands and mouse genetics in conjunction with genetic, biochemical, immunochemical, and transcriptomic techniques. Our rationale for investigating this hypothesis is that understanding how progenitor cells are regulated during organ formation and after injury is critical if we are to repair, regenerate or replace the LG, and improve patient quality of life."
"9465755","Multiple myeloma is incurable hematologic malignancy with an expected median survival of 7-8 years. The proteasome inhibitors, bortezomib, carfilzomib and the recently approved ixazomib, are a mainstay of current myeloma treatment. Despite an initial response rate approaching 90% to proteasome inhibitor-containing combinations, all patients relapse and eventually become resistant to any treatments. We have discovered a distinct proteasome inhibitor, LU-102, which re-sensitizes bortezomib and carfilzomib-resistant cell lines and primary cells from myeloma patients to these FDA-approved proteasome inhibitors, and sensitizes myeloma to sub-toxic doses of carfilzomib in mice. The primary targets of all FDA-approved inhibitors are the ß5 sites (PSMB5 and PSMB8) of the proteasome. The primary targets of LU-102 are PSMB7 (ß2) and PSMB10 (ß2i) subunits. Thus, we hypothesize that PSMB7 and PSMB10 are novel targets in relapsed and refractory myeloma. LU-102 is protected by two patents, which Dartmouth owns and agreed to license to InhiProt. The specific aim of the phase I of the project is to improve potency and pharmacological properties of LU-102. We will use standard medicinal chemistry approaches to achieve the milestone of developing a new highly specific compound, which specifically inhibits PSMB7 and PSMB10 in bone marrow by >75% at 10 mg/kg, and does not cross blood-brain barrier. In the phase II of the award, we will conduct efficacy experiments in animal models of multiple myeloma, and perform PK and ADMET studies. We will test whether the lead synergizes with other anti-myeloma agents. We will solve structures of new inhibitor in complex with the proteasome, and will use it to refine the lead."
"9446221","Project Summary ? Overall The outcomes of patients with metastatic melanoma have improved dramatically over the last decade due to an improved understanding of the molecular drivers of this disease. In particular, multiple targeted therapy regimens have been approved for patients with a BRAFV600E/K mutation, which are present in ~50% of cutaneous melanomas. These treatments achieve clinical responses in ~80% of patients with a BRAFV600E/K mutation, thus providing proof- of-concept of the therapeutic potential for personalized therapeutic strategies. However, most of the patients will progress within 2 years of starting those therapies. Further, currently there are no targeted therapies that have been shown to be effective in patients with a wild-type BRAF. Thus, there are unmet clinical needs to develop treatments that prevent or overcome resistance to existing therapies for patients with a BRAFV600E/K mutation, and that are effective in patients without a BRAF mutation. In order to facilitate the development of new therapeutic strategies, over the last 5 years we have led a major effort to develop a broad collection of PDX models to reflect the clinical, histological, and genetic heterogeneity of this disease. Our collection of >450 PDX models represents one of the largest collections for any human malignancy, and our initial testing demonstrates that the collection accurately recapituluates the oncogenic drivers and molecular heterogeneity that is observed in patients. This collection also includes a subset of PDX established from patients with acquired resistance to targeted therapies that have been maintained on those agents in vivo to sustain their resistant phenotype. Together these efforts have generated a robust resource to develop, refine, and prioritize new personalized combinatorial therapies for patients. Thus, we propose to establish a multi-disciplinary and multi-institutional PDTC Program focused on the use and continued expansion of our robutst melanoma PDX collection to identify new therapeutic approaches that fill important clinical gaps in this disease. Project 1 will characterize kinase inhibitors targeting receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) and the PI3K-AKT pathway in combination with approved targeted therapies in PDX models in treatment-naïve and drug- resistant BRAFV600E/K-mutant melanomas. Project 2 will characterize targeting the apoptotic machinery of cancer cells as a combinatorial approach with MAPK pathway inhibitors in PDX with and without BRAFV600E/K mutations, including in subsets with aberrancies in anti-apoptotic genes. Both Projects will utilize baseline characteristics of the PDX models to identify potential biomarkers of sensitivity and resistance to guide personalized patient selection for future clinical testing. In addition, tumors will be analyzed for treatment-induced effects that correlate with sensitivity to identified resistance mechanisms and potential new combinatorial strategies. Finally, markers identified in the preclinical models will be compared to parallel biomarker studies of metastatic melanoma patients enrolled in clinical trials utilizing the same agents. These studies will be supported by the PDX, Bioinformatics, and Administrative Cores to ensure their success, along with a Pilot Project program to open new areas of investigation. Together these studies will have high potential to translate into new personalized clinical trials for patients. 1"
"9482608","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The development of effective therapies for cancer requires a deep molecular understanding of tumor heterogeneity by advanced omics technologies with spatially resolved measurements. Unfortunately, there are substantial gaps in existing capabilities in terms of sensitivity. For example, a minimum of many thousands of cells is required for in-depth profiling of proteins in a biological sample. We have recently developed a breakthrough technology, termed nanoPOTS (Nanodroplet Preparation in One pot for Trace Samples) which, when coupled to ultrasensitive liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS), enables effective analysis of as few as 10 mammalian cells with a coverage of >3000 identified proteins. We hypothesize that the nanoPOTS platform will be an enabling technology to characterize the molecular underpinnings of tumor heterogeneity by creating 3D proteome maps of human tumors. The overall objective of our study is to extend and validate this analysis platform to enable single-cell resolution measurements at high throughput (>100 samples per day) and apply the platform to create 3D proteome maps of human tumors. Studies in Aim 1 will focus on optimizing and validating the ultrasensitive nanoPOTS proteomic workflow to enable robust proteome profiling of ?3,000 protein groups from single human cells obtained by both flow cytometry and laser capture microdissection (LCM). Aim 2 will evaluate and compare two complementary technologies for increasing measurement throughput to ~100 cells/day with minimal impact on proteome coverage. We will determine whether multiplexing through application of isobaric labels for pooled analysis, or rapid LC coupled with ultrahigh resolution ion mobility spectrometry-MS provides greatest coverage, quantitation and reproducibility for single cell proteomics at the desired throughput. In Aim 3, we will apply the optimized platform to create in-depth proteome maps for human pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas (PDAs) at single cell resolution. Following initial targeted studies of specific cells of interest within sectioned tissues, we will use a combination of cryosectioning, LCM and the optimized nanoPOTS platform to analyze single cells within the tumor microenvironment. 3D reconstruction of these in-depth, spatially resolved proteomic analyses will provide the first global proteomic tumor maps at single-cell resolution. This project will not only establish an innovative measurement capability that will broadly advance cancer research, but will also provide unique molecular insights into cellular heterogeneity relevant to PDA pathology. The resulting platform will be disseminated through a combination of publication and commercialization."
"9420377","Project Summary Recent studies indicate that 30% of Latina women in the United States are living with clinically significant depressive and anxiety symptoms, and that these rates increase with time spent in the United States. Latina immigrants are particularly vulnerable to depression and anxiety due to the many social and economic stressors they face, including: high levels of poverty, low levels of education, family obligations, language barriers, and social isolation. Latina immigrants suffering from depression and anxiety are also less likely to access and utilize quality mental health care, due to lack of health insurance, few culturally and linguistically competent providers, and stigma associated with seeking mental health care. Community-based interventions that increase coping strategies and provide social support can help reduce mental health disparities among Mexican immigrant women. The proposed study aims to address National Institute of Health priorities by testing the efficacy of the Amigas Latinas Motivando el Alma (ALMA) intervention in a randomized waitlist control trial. ALMA is an 8-week program offered in a group format to teach women new coping strategies and enhance their social ties and social support to prevent and reduce their depression and anxiety. Aim 1 of the proposed study is to refine the ALMA intervention and study procedures to ensure they are culturally-relevant, using information gained from focus groups and cognitive interviews with Mexican immigrant women. Aim 2 is to determine the efficacy of the ALMA intervention to reduce depressive and anxiety symptoms using a randomized waitlist control study design. We will recruit women from community-based organizations serving Latino immigrants to participate in the program, which will be offered in community settings. We will assess process outcomes of recruitment, retention, fidelity, and participant satisfaction through observations and in- depth interviews with participants. We will assess the efficacy of the intervention by comparing changes in women?s depressive and anxiety symptoms in the intervention and waitlist control groups at four time points (pre-intervention, post-intervention, 3 months, 6 months). Aim 3 is to assess the potential impact of the intervention on both individual (stigma, stress, coping strategies) and interpersonal (social support, social ties) factors, and whether the impact of the intervention is mediated by these factors. The research team includes investigators in psychology, medicine, social work and public health, as well as community-based organizations serving Mexican immigrants. The study uses rigorous methods to test an innovative program that integrates both culturally relevant and evidenced-based strategies to address significant mental health disparities in a high-risk and underserved population. Findings will help inform future research and practice. Given the growth of the Latino population, identifying interventions that reduce mental health disparities among Mexican immigrant women can have a significant public health impact."

The individual Genetic Research Centers (GRCs) and the collective NIDDK IBD Genetics Consortium have successfully interacted for the last fifteen years to lead many of these discoveries. However, despite significant progress it is still unknown how the vast majority of these variants or other risk factors lead to development of IBD and its two major subtypes - Crohn?s disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). Answering these questions is critical to advancing our knowledge of IBD pathophysiology. The University of Toronto GRC, led by Dr. Mark Silverberg, has made unique and substantial contributions in this field by virtue of its longstanding clinical and genetics expertise in IBD. Since 2002, Dr. Silverberg has established a very large, comprehensive registry of well characterized, longitudinally followed IBD patients at Mount Sinai Hospital in addition to accompanying biospecimens stored at his laboratory at the Lunenfeld- Tanenbaum Research Institute in order to facilitate research in IBD. Utilizing these resources, the UTGRC will advance the understanding of UC pathophysiology in the following ways: (1) Identify gene expression profiles and pathways that will aid in understanding the mechanisms of UC relapse and prediction of UC relapse and their regulation by miRNAs and chromatin accessibility. This will be accomplished by measuring gene expression, miRNA and chromatic accessibility profiles in the colonic tissue of UC subjects immediately prior to the onset of inflammation relative to baseline measurements. (2) Identify intestinal microbes and microbial function that precede UC relapse. This will be accomplished by determining the composition of the microbial flora adherent to the intestinal tissue as well as that of stool sampled at and comparing the same time points described in (1). (3) Continue to support the mutually agreed upon Consortium-wide studies involving elucidating the factors contributing to relapse of inflammation following surgery in CD subjects, completing the discovery of all genetic variation associated with IBD, advancing our knowledge of the functional biology of such genetic variation and to utilize these data to bring clinically meaningful tools into use to promote improved outcomes for individuals affected by IBD. These will be accomplished by patient recruitment and by bringing our significant clinical and scientific expertise to the IBDGC. This will be accomplished by ongoing clinical patient and biospecimen recruitment and by bringing significant clinical and scientific expertise to the Consortium team."
"9553013","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Keratins are the most abundant proteins in surface epithelia, in which they form cytoplasmic networks of 10 nm wide intermediate filaments (IFs). Keratins are encoded by an evolutionarily conserved multigene family, with 54 individual members subdivided into two major types (I and II). The pairwise regulation of type I and type II keratins in epithelia reflects a strict heteropolymerization requirement. In addition, keratin gene are regulated in an epithelial tissue-type and differentiation-specific fashion, the functional bass of which is only partly understood. Our efforts in this project are focused on defining the properties and function of the type I keratins 16 and 17 (K16, K17), and type II keratins 6a and 6b (K6a, K6b) in skin epithelia, which are of particular interest because of their dual involvement in human disease. First, genetic mutations in Krt6a/b, Krt16 or Krt17 cause genodermatoses with pathological features reflecting grossly altered skin homeostasis, including pachyonychia congenita (PC), palmoplantar keratoderma (PPK), and steatocystoma multiplex. The main tissues affected by these disorders are ectoderm-derived epithelial appendages and glabrous skin, and represent the sites of constitutive expression of these genes. Second, elevated expression of these keratin genes impacts the onset and course of chronic hyperproliferative and inflammatory skin diseases, e.g., psoriasis and cancer. The latter results from the massive induction of these keratin proteins in interfollicular epidermis under such abnormal circumstances, combined with their emerging role as regulators of cell growth, tissue inflammation and immune responses in skin epithelia.  During the last period of support, we discovered that a nuclear form of K17 plays a significant role in regulating the expression of genes involved in growth control, inflammation and immunity in skin keratinocytes. Going forward, we propose to: (Aim 1a) Identify the mechanisms and regulation of import/export of K17 to/from the nucleus, and identify the protein partners of K17 inside the nucleus; (Aim 1b) Map K17 protein binding sites throughout the genome of resting versus stimulated skin keratinocytes; and (Aim 1c) Generate and characterize a mouse in which K17 cannot be imported in the nucleus but is otherwise fully functional. We also showed that the PPK lesions that spontaneously arise in Krt16 null mice resemble those occurring in PC patients and are in part the result of hypoactive Keap1-Nrf2 signaling. Going forward we will: (Aim 2a) Assess the consequence of expressing PC-causing missense Krt16 alleles in mouse; (Aim 2b) Define the mechanism(s) through which K16 regulates Keap1/Nrf2-dependent gene expression; and (Aim 2c) Identify other protein partners and pathways through which K16 regulates innate immunity and the skin barrier. Upon completion of this project we hope to have defined the significance of the presence of keratin 17 in the nucleus, thus paving the way for efforts to assess the general importance of this property among keratins, and to have established that activating Nrf2 function presents a genuine opportunity for the therapy of PC/PPK."
"9275243","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) claims more than 200,000 lives globally every year, and there are still no effective therapies in use for this fatal  disease. Besides universal loss of the RB and P53 tumor suppressors required for SCLC initiation, the key pathways driving SCLC progression have still not been identified. Our long-term goal is to understand the molecular events that result in the aggressive itinerary of SCLC. Recent efforts to sequence the genomes of over 100 human SCLC tumors have identified rare oncogenic mutations and some regions undergoing amplification, but these analyses failed to shed light on a central oncogenic pathway that may drive the development of this cancer. Recently, the concept of non-oncogene addiction has emerged, which states that cancers may require certain active molecular pathways that are unmarked by mutations. Therefore, active but non-mutated signaling transductors such as kinases may play crucial roles in the development of cancers while remaining undiscovered by sequencing approaches. Using novel proteomic methodology, we recently obtained a first view of the active kinome of SCLC. Among active kinases in SCLC, Mek5 is particularly intriguing. Mek5 and its downstream target, Erk5, comprise a still poorly characterized signaling pathway; emerging evidence suggests that, similar to the more studied Mek1/2- Erk1/2 pathway, the Mek5/Erk5 axis may also regulate cell survival and cycling. Mek5 and Erk5 have never been studied in SCLC cells and little is still known about their role in cancer in general. Here we hypothesize that the Mek5/Erk5 module is crucial to the growth of SCLC. This hypothesis is supported by our preliminary observations that Mek5- or Erk5-deficient SCLC cells show severe growth deficiencies and increased apoptotic cell death. However, we lack a complete understanding of the requirement for this axis in SCLC development in the organismal context, and of how Mek5/Erk5 may be performing these roles. To investigate the role of the Mek5/Erk5 kinase axis in SCLC, we will utilize patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) and a genetically-engineered mouse model of SCLC. We first propose to determine if the Mek5/Erk5 axis is necessary for SCLC initiation and progression in mice in vivo. Second, we will investigate the role of Mek5/Erk5 in SCLC maintenance using genetic and pharmacological approaches. Third, we will perform structure-function studies and use advanced proteomics to investigate the mechanisms of action of Erk5 in SCLC cells. This study will characterize a novel non-mutated tumorigenic signaling pathway in the development of SCLC. We hope that a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying SCLC development will aid to identify novel therapeutic approaches for patient treatment."
"9325281","Project summary Type-2 inflammation, characterized in part by the production of cytokines IL-5 and IL-13, is a hallmark feature of asthma. Recently, the innate and adaptive immune systems have been shown to play critical roles in coordinating the development and propagation of type-2 inflammation in the airways. Previous discoveries by our group and others have revealed that secreted PLA2 (sPLA2) activity is increased in the airways of asthmatics, with much of the observed sPLA2 activity attributed to one member in particular, sPLA2 group X (sPLA2-X), which is primarily expressed by epithelial cells and macrophages. Enzymatic activity of sPLA2-X contributes to the pool of eicosanoids in the airways, but the function of sPLA2s beyond their enzymatic activity is not well understood. Because of the established involvement of sPLA2-X in settings of human asthma, we seek to better define the function of sPLA2-X during allergic inflammation of the airways using in vivo models of experimental asthma. Our preliminary data suggest that 1) genetic ablation of sPLA2-X protects against the development of a type-2 immune response and 2) sPLA2-X given as an adjuvant promotes both innate and adaptive components of type-2 inflammation. In this application, we seek to uncover the mechanism by which sPLA2-X initiates a type-2 immune response in the airways. Our primary hypothesis is that sPLA2-X acts as an adjuvant to enhance type 2 immune responses through the release of epithelial derived cytokines including IL-33 and polarization of ILC2s. We further postulate that TGM2 serves to augment the function of sPLA2-X during the development of allergic inflammation. In Aim 1, we focus on the importance of IL-33 in driving type-2 inflammation and ILC2 polarization using a sPLA2-X/OVA model of experimental asthma. Using murine and human airway epithelial cells, we examine the specific contribution of epithelial sPLA2-X function in the release and expression of epithelial-derived cytokines that promote type-2 inflammation. In Aim 2 we examine the involvement of TGM2 in the development of type-2 inflammation and whether TGM2 acts by regulating sPLA2-X activity. Completion of these studies will provide a more thorough understanding of sPLA2-X function in allergic lung disease and further validation of sPLA2-X as a novel therapeutic target in settings of asthma."
"9469747","Project Summary Memory allows us to use previous experience to guide current behavior. Computational models of episodic memory propose that recalling an event from the past involves reinstating patterns of cortical activity that were evoked when the event occurred. While there is considerable evidence for reinstatement within early sensory areas, recent evidence suggests that reinstatement also occurs in higher-level regions, such as lateral parietal cortex, that are strongly predictive of memory success. However, the significance of reinstatement in lateral parietal cortex and its relation to reinstatement in sensory areas is not well understood. Understanding how areas like lateral parietal cortex represent, transform, and prioritize information from sensory areas will be critical to building a full model of how distributed brain networks support healthy and dysfunctional memory. Addressing these gaps in understanding will require a multidisciplinary approach that relies on innovative fMRI analyses, computational modeling, and integrating evidence from neuroimaging and electrophysiology. My dissertation work so far has used fMRI approaches to test the hypothesis that lateral parietal cortex represents sensory content during memory retrieval. This work has produced several significant results in favor of this hypothesis and has involved the development of new fMRI methods. In the proposed research and training program, I will use computational models of visual encoding to discriminate between competing hypotheses of how topographic maps in parietal cortex encode spatial information during memory retrieval. This experience will provide training in visual neuroscience and computational modeling, allowing me to develop expertise with diverse approaches to studying episodic memory. In the proposed postdoctoral training phase, I will gain theoretical and methodological training in electrophysiological measurements collected from humans. The combination of fMRI and electrophysiology measurements will allow me to test novel hypotheses about how memory signals propagate through time across distinct brain regions, and to generate findings that unify research performed in human and non-human animal systems. This research program has significant potential to generate novel understanding of the cortical mechanisms that support memory retrieval, to bridge findings across measurements techniques, and to inform the treatment of aging- and disease-related memory disorders. I am confident that the training provided by this research program will allow me to develop the diverse theoretical and methodological expertise needed to conduct independent research on a core set of questions in systems and cognitive neuroscience."
"9301870","The long-term goals of this project are to determine how repeated, subclinical brain stress may lead to clinically significant brain damage, and to use this knowledge to prevent cumulative neurological disability. Sub-concussion is an under-recognized phenomenon, in which cranial impact does not lead to clinical symptoms, but when repeated frequently, can cause measurable neurological dysfunction in athletes and others engaged in activities that introduce mild mechanical stresses to the brain. Little is known about how brain tissue injury develops and resolves at the cellular level in these cases because no individual episode of physical trauma is sufficiently strong enough to cause outwardly observable concussion symptoms. Such sub-concussive blows occur frequently during the course of normal play (blocking in football, heading in soccer, etc.). However, without obvious clinical signs, underlying neurological damage goes unnoticed, players return to play and damage can accumulate over time. The proposed project is based on the premise that mild mechanical impact introduces brain stress unobservable by self-examination, or common diagnostics, but detectable by specialized behavioral tests and cutting-edge extracelluar vesicle analysis techniques. Such techniques could determine when it is safe or dangerous to resume the activity. Using soccer heading to induce mild mechanical stress on brain tissue, we have established an innovative human experimental paradigm that is indicative of commonly experienced stress levels during sports/recreational activities. With this paradigm, we will develop new tools to characterize the neurological effects of sub-concussive impact. In Aim 1, we will quantify behavioral effects of mild head impact using sensitive measures of postural stability during standing and walking. In Aim 2, we will determine a circulating molecular pattern of subconcussive head injury using an innovative technique for blood brain barrier- and CNS cell-derived microvesicle profiling. In Aim 3, we will identify a unique microRNA signature of subconcussive head impact in circulating exosomes using cutting-edge sequencing technology. The proposed study is innovative because it will introduce an entirely new dimension to the pathophysiology of subconcussive head impact. Results of this project will potentially lead to the development of innovative behavioral and molecular diagnostic tools to assess risk of cumulative brain injury."
"9466322","ABSTRACT The technology that will be developed in this NIH SBIR Phase I and, later, Phase II proposal will provide novel systems for optical guidance of spinal surgery that will not use any of the expensive components currently used for surgical navigation, intra-operative CT or O-arm imaging or robotics. Instead, the technology will leverage innovative, new hardware such as optical head mounted displays (OHMD) with a low hardware cost, which have become recently available for gaming and industrial applications, against novel techniques of optically registering a patient and a surgical site using optical markers with defined shapes, dimensions and geometries. The system will not require the development or use of expensive imaging equipment in the operating room, but rather utilize existing fluoroscopic equipment available in every operating room in the U.S. By avoiding any of the expensive components of standard surgical navigation, O-arm imaging or intra-operative CT scanning, and robotics, the proposed technology can be made available at a fraction of the price of current systems for guiding spinal fusion for surgical planning. The preliminary data indicate that an accuracy of better than 2mm, possibly better than 1mm, can be achieved which is comparable to the clinical accuracy of current navigation and image guidance system. Novel techniques for further increasing the accuracy of optical registration using OHMD's in this proposal include among others:  - Geometric patterns for optical markers optimized for real-time optical detection and recognition using images from the  OHMD's video camera.  - Use of a priori knowledge of marker size and geometry to determine distance from the OHMD and orientation relative  to the OHMD.  - Shapes optimized for real-time detection using sensor information from the OHMD's depth camera.  - Software to register surgical instruments utilizing optical markers. Optical guidance with existing OHMD hardware and novel software and technology developed in this proposal paired with existing radiographic equipment in the operating room holds the promise to provide accurate intra-operative guidance in a highly cost-efficient manner at fraction of the price of existing navigation, intra-operative CT or O-arm imaging and robotic approaches. Unlike existing techniques, optical guidance using OHMD's and augmented reality display provide a unique advantage of greatly improved hand-eye coordination by accurately registering and superimposing both fluoroscopic image data and the intended path for the surgical instruments onto the surgical field and the corresponding anatomic landmarks, thereby offering a significant benefit over all current techniques. This unique approach has the potential to reduce deviation from the intended path and the possibility of even greater placement accuracy of pedicle screws resulting in less complications."
"9357394","PROJECT 2: Repeat derepression and RNA-mediated toxicity in FSHD Abstract FSHD is caused by somatic derepression of the normally transcriptionally silent D4Z4 locus and subsequent expression of the disease gene DUX4. The broad and long-term goal of this project is to identify molecular pathways downstream of D4Z4 derepression that may be targeted to slow disease progression or improve muscle function. The major hypothesis of this project is that repetitive and other aberrant RNAs contribute to DUX4 cytotoxicity and modify FSHD severity. The specific goal of the project is to identify the mechanistic origins of aberrant RNA production and cytotoxicity, and determine whether these toxic RNAs modify FSHD penetrance. This will be accomplished by: Aim 1, Determine the molecular mechanisms of DUX4-mediated inhibition of RNA surveillance; Aim 2, Determine the subset of DUX4-induced RNAs that are actively translated, and test whether these aberrant RNAs produce abnormal proteins or novel peptides in DUX4-expressing cells; Aim 3, Determine whether genetic variation influences repetitive RNA expression to modify FSHD penetrance. Together, these aims will identify mechanisms that promote stable expression of repetitive and other aberrant RNAs, thereby contributing to DUX4 toxicity and acting as a novel modifier of FSHD penetrance. The significance of these studies is that they will identify molecular pathways downstream of D4Z4 derepression that mediate DUX4 toxicity and contribute to variable penetrance of FSHD. The health relatedness is that RNA-mediated mechanisms of toxicity may provide opportunities for therapeutic intervention downstream of D4Z4 derepression."
"9412580","PROJECT SUMMARY: The vast majority of individuals with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) have multiple chronic conditions (MCC). The combination of ADRD plus other conditions (ADRD-MCC) leads to more medication use, more complex medication regimens for patients, and is associated with greater risk of adverse drug events, drug interactions, treatment burden and cognitive changes in addition to higher rates of hospitalization and mortality. Optimizing medication through deprescribing (the process of reducing or stopping the use of inappropriate medications or medications unlikely to be beneficial) can help avoid adverse drug effects and improve outcomes for MCC patients, particularly for those with ADRD. Deprescribing is a nascent field in the U.S. that is likely to have a significant positive impact over the next decade if properly developed and implemented. We propose a project to refine and test a pragmatic deprescribing intervention for people with ADRD-MCC so that these patients are on ?just right? medication regimens. Our overall goal for the project is to refine and test a patient- and family/caregiver- centric deprescribing intervention that is applicable to multiple medications and can be adapted to a variety of healthcare delivery settings. The intervention will target older adults with ADRD-MCC on 5 or more medications and their family caregivers and deliver the intervention at Kaiser Permanente Colorado (KPCO), a not-for-profit integrated delivery system. Aims 1 and 2 will focus on engaging patients, family/ caregivers, clinicians and health system stakeholders to enhance, refine, and pilot test the intervention. Aims 3 and 4 will test the effectiveness of the intervention in reducing number of chronic medications and number of potentially in appropriate medications as well secondary outcomes of patient falls, adverse drug events, hospital and skilled nursing facility utilization, activities of daily living, and outpatient office visit length. Aim 5 will qualitatively explore mechanisms behind intervention effectiveness. The proposed project will demonstrate the potential to implement sustainable changes in medication management to improve the health and safety of patients with ADRD receiving treatment for comorbid conditions with multiple medications. It will be adaptable to other delivery systems and settings, and is designed to foster a culture of thoughtful medication decision-making acceptable to ADRD-MCC patients, caregivers, and their clinicians."
"9321598","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Southern Nevada Health District (SNHD) has the opportunity to expand upon a recent pilot study conducted in conjunction with team members from University of Rochester and their subcontractors at Google[X] and Answer Informatics working with a social media monitoring software (SoMMS) entitled nEmesis. The software nEmesis identifies tweets suggestive of foodborne illness by following a user for up to two weeks after the user posts from a food establishment. The nEmesis software then assigns a score to the food establishment based on the quantity and severity of sick tweets. In the pilot program, researchers are observing whether restaurants with high scores also tended to have worse health inspection outcomes as compared to blind assigned controls.  In the proposed research, SNHD plans to expand the software by incorporating existing foodborne illness data, including foodborne illness complaints and customer's sanitation complaints, into the software and allowing it to influence the score. The score will then be used as a tool to determine when and where a regulatory response is needed such as a routine inspection, or an epidemiological investigation, depending on the severity.  By using this novel technology, SNHD will potentially be able to identify cases of unreported foodborne illness faster and investigate cases and potential outbreaks quickly resulting in the reduced spread of disease in the community. Furthermore, if the intervention of unifying the nEmesis software with other foodborne illness predictors is able to identify foodborne illness outbreaks more quickly, less valuable time will need to be spent in the field investigating foodborne illness concerns.  In the proposed research study, SNHD will evaluate whether the intervention has an effect on foodborne illness in the community by monitoring rates of lab?confirmed salmonellosis and E. coli O157:H7, quantity of foodborne illness reports, and quantity of customer complaints on restaurant sanitation. Secondly, SNHD will evaluate whether the intervention has an effect on time spent investigating verified foodborne illness complaints and verified customer sanitation complaints. This data will be collected over the life of the research and then compared to baseline data and analyzed for differences."
"9320028","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Workers under the age of 25 have an increased risk of workplace violence compared to all workers combined. Given their predominant employment in the high-risk retail and service industries, the lack of violence prevention programs in these industries, and the fact that youth may be uniquely affected by workplace violence due to their ongoing physical and psychological development, young workers are a vulnerable population at risk. Our current understanding of workplace violence in this population largely comes from occupational injury surveillance data. However, data from these systems underestimate the prevalence of violence and lack information about perpetrators, event circumstances, psychological harms, distal consequences of violence (e.g., job loss, poor academic achievement) and exposure to workplace violence prevention training. Therefore, to adequately investigate workplace violence among youth, alternative methodological approaches are needed. We propose a national telephone survey with a representative sample of 1000 US youth 15-24 years of age to accomplish the following aims: 1) to estimate the prevalence of workplace violence victimization among young workers and characterize cases by employment-, worker-, and event-characteristics; 2) to characterize employer-provided workplace violence prevention training received by young workers; 3) to identify risk factors for workplace violence victimization among young workers; and 4) to describe the employment and educational consequences of workplace violence victimization among young workers and examine associations between these outcomes and worker and event characteristics. The proposed work addresses the NORA cross-sector program on Traumatic Injury (Goal 3: Reduce occupational injuries and deaths due to workplace violence; Goal 5: Reduce occupational injuries and deaths among high risk and vulnerable worker groups). It also addresses NORA's Service sector program (Goal 11: By 2015, reduce the frequency of workplace violence events by 20% in restaurants and food delivery services.) The following are the major contributions of the proposed study, several of which will directly contribute to the achievement of the above NORA goals: 1) this study will produce a more accurate estimate of workplace violence victimization prevalence among workers under age 25 than surveillance methods have been able to achieve; 2) it will provide the first workplace violence risk factor data focused on young worker populations; 3) it will provide details on the content and quantity of workplace violence training young workers receive from their employers; and 4) it will generate some of the first data on the more distal consequences that experiencing workplace violence can have on youth's employment and education. Near-term outputs from the proposed work will include presentations at national conferences, peer-reviewed publications, and access to the national survey data."
"9383287","PROJECT SUMMARY How functionally flexible is human cortex? The current proposal approaches this question by studying visual cortex plasticity in blindness. In individuals who are blind from birth, so-called ?visual? cortices respond to touch and sound. How similar are these new functions to the original visual computations? A longstanding view is that functional reorganization is limited, even in cases of plasticity. Our recent published work and preliminary data, however, suggest that functional reorganization in the visual cortices of blind individuals may be more radical than previously thought. We find that regions within retinotopic visual cortices are active during language and math tasks, and that this activity is sensitive to the grammatical structure of sentences and the difficulty of math equations. Such functional repurposing is striking, in light of the cognitive and evolutionary differences between vision, language and mathematics. These new findings offer an unprecedented opportunity to test the limits of human cortical flexibility. In this proposal we test the hypothesis that human cortex is functionally pluripotent: capable of assuming a wide range of cognitive functions depending on input, where input is determined by experience and connectivity. We hypothesize that language-related plasticity in visual cortices is part of a broader phenomenon whereby, in blindness, visual cortices are colonized by multiple distinct higher-cognitive functions as a result of strong connectivity between visual cortex and higher-cognitive networks, and fronto-parietal networks in particular. Up until now there has been little evidence for specialization within visual cortices of blind individuals. Aim 1 tests the prediction that in individuals who are blind from birth different regions within visual cortices are specialized for: language, number, and cognitive control and that specialization is related to connectivity with different fronto-parietal networks. In the first part of Aim 2, we use multi-voxel pattern analysis and fMRI adaptation to test the prediction that visual cortices of blind individuals represent higher-cognitive information, such as the meanings of words and numerical quantity. Next we test the prediction that visual cortices are functionally relevant to higher-cognitive behavior using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). Aim 3 examines the time-course of visual cortex plasticity during the lifespan. By working with individuals who lost their sight at different ages we test the hypothesis that cortex assumes higher-cognitive functions only during a sensitive period of development. This work is highly relevant to understanding the pathophysiology of visual impairments and uncovering the timing and mechanisms by which blindness affects the human brain. The insights about plasticity to be gained from the proposed project have far-reaching relevance for optimizing cortical function in the context of neurological and cognitive disabilities."
"9468164","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The prevalence of asthma, particularly among children in industrialized countries, has been increasing rapidly over the last 2-3 decades. We reported that exposure of mouse dams to the environmental estrogen (EE) bisphenol A (BPA) promotes the development of an asthma-like phenotype in their pups. The potential importance of our findings in mice for human asthma is supported by two recent birth cohort studies and an analysis of national survey data, each indicating an association between pre- or postnatal exposure to BPA and the prevalence of wheezing in children. Preliminary mechanistic studies on spleen cells from our mouse model suggest that perinatal exposure to BPA, followed by postnatal allergic sensitization, results in altered methylation of a key CpG motif in the promoter region of the IFN¿ gene in splenic DNA and over expression of IFN¿ mRNA and protein in both CD4+T and CD8+T cells. We also found that the effect of BPA exposure on asthma persisted through at least three matrilineal generations, suggesting that these epigenetic alterations of immune development are heritable. Initial relevance studies indicated that exogenous IFN¿ stimulates human cord (neonatal) blood basophils to increase their expression of major histocompatibility complex class II and inducible costimulatory-ligand, both of which are crucial for effective antigen-presenting activity, which can promote the development of T helper (Th) type 2. In this exploratory project, our observations on the epigenetic effects of BPA will be corroborated and extended to the whole DNA methylomes of several immune cell types, thereby providing a road map of the effects of BPA on asthma-related pathways. Our central hypothesis for this project is that fetal exposure to BPA induces epigenetic modulation of the developing immune systems, which promotes the development of childhood asthma and that these epigenetic effects can persists into adulthood and be passed to future generations. Based on our and others' recent findings, we will focus this project on the effects of a single EE, BPA on the DNA methylome of three populations of mouse splenocytes. Bioinformatics analyses of our findings will predict patterns of gene expression in CD4+T, CD8+T and antigen presenting cell (APC)s and define pathways and interactions that could promote the development of childhood asthma. We will test this central hypothesis in our mouse model by testing two specific hypotheses: Aim 1. Fetal exposure to BPA enhances postnatal allergic sensitization and promotes the development of an asthma-like phenotype, by causing epigenetic alterations in key genes in the CD4+T, CD8+T and/or APCs, and Aim 2. Key BPA-related alterations of DNA methylation patterns are transferred to subsequent generations. The outcomes of this exploratory project will provide a new understanding of the molecular basis by which exposure to BPA promotes the development of allergic asthma. Future studies will indicate whether similar mechanisms are also altered by other EEs, as well as developing programs to prevent or reverse these EE effects on the development of asthma."
"9334867","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We live in a multisensory world, in which stimuli of various types constantly compete for our attention. Information about objects or events typically appears on more than one sensory channel, so that integrating inputs across sensory systems (e.g. vision and hearing) can enhance the signal-to-noise ratio and lead to more efficient perception and action. There is increasing interest in studying how stimulus properties in one sensory modality (e.g. vision) correspond to those in another modality (e.g. hearing). For instance, sounds of high pitch are linked to small-sized visual objects whereas sounds of low pitch are linked with large objects; sounds of high/low pitch are associated with, respectively, visual stimuli of high/low elevation; and even aspects of linguistic stimuli such as vowel quality are associated with visual properties such as object size. Such crossmodal correspondences are important factors in multisensory binding. While information has exploded on the kinds of stimulus features that are reliably associated by human observers across modalities, currently there is little neural evidence to allow a mechanistic account of how crossmodal correspondences arise, or how they relate to synesthesia, a phenomenon in which some individuals experience unusual percepts (e.g. colors) triggered by particular stimuli (e.g. letters. Our goal is to address these important gaps in knowledge, by using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in humans to investigate the neural mechanisms underlying crossmodal and synesthetic correspondences and thus to distinguish between alternative explanations that have been offered. A number of possible mechanisms have been entertained for crossmodal correspondences. These include: Hypothesis A - learned associations due to statistical co-occurrences, which would predict that the correspondences are based in multisensory or even classic unisensory regions; Hypothesis B - semantic mediation (e.g. the common word high may mediate the link between high pitch and high elevation); and Hypothesis C - conceptual linking via a high-level property such as magnitude. In a series of eight experiments that comprise three Specific Aims, we propose to examine these competing accounts, recognizing that some or all of them may be operative, and that the mechanisms may vary between different types of crossmodal correspondences."
"9385106","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The proposed project is an R24 infrastructure support grant responsive to RFA-ES-16-004, ?Maintain and Enrich Resource Infrastructure for Existing Environmental Epidemiology Cohorts.? We propose to maintain and enrich resource infrastructure for the Rhode Island Children's Health Study (RICHS), a cohort developed to examine the impact of the environment on newborn and early childhood health outcomes with a novel focus on the mechanistic role of placenta molecular function. RICHS is a highly productive cohort resource?data collection and analyses to date have resulted in over 40 peer-reviewed publications, and 3 research project grants since 2008 (R01MH094609, R01ES022223, R01ES025145); RICHS has also served as a resource for the training and independent research development of 21 pre- and postdoctoral students and junior faculty. Data and results from the cohort have contributed to the understanding of the fundamental molecular biology of the placenta, the impact of environmental exposures on placental epigenetic regulation, links between placental epigenetic variation in newborn growth and neurobehavioral outcomes, as well as novel methods development. The RICHS cohort is comprised of 840 mother-offspring pairs from the Rhode Island and Southeastern Massachusetts region enrolled from a single, population-representative medical center. RICHS offspring were studied in infancy, but maintenance funds are needed for longitudinal follow-up. The proposed infrastructure support would facilitate future prospective, longitudinal assessments within this extensively characterized prenatal cohort, including novel child health and disease outcomes, postnatal environmental exposures, as well as novel and repeated measures of molecular mediators and biomarkers during the critical window of susceptibility of childhood and early adolescence. The proposed infrastructure support will also allow extensive resource-sharing of RICHS data with the larger scientific community. The specific goals of this R24 are to: (1) recontact and reconsent all RICHS mother-child pairs to allow for continued and expanded follow-up, (2) develop an innovative website for cohort maintenance and cohort community building, (3) develop a web-based data collection system for ongoing data collection using REDCap, (4) provide ongoing incentives for maintaining participant investment in RICHS, (5) collect medical record, neurodevelopmental measures and biospecimens for future research studies, and (6) develop systems for broad sharing of cohort data with the larger research community. Our study fits with NIEHS goals to identify fundamental shared mechanisms, to consider the totality of human exposures, biological pathways, and disease pathogenesis, to foster collaboration, and to inspire new cadre of environmental health scientists. Ultimately, the proposed RICHS infrastructure support will maximize NIEHS investment in a unique cohort resource to allow for further seminal work from our highly productive research group and broad sharing of data and resources with the scientific community."
"9335860","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Primary open angle glaucoma (POAG) is treated by risk factor management for which the only modifiable risk factor is intraocular pressure (IOP). Previous physiologic studies identified the trabecular meshwork (TM) as the primary resistor to aqueous humor outflow from the eye and determined that diseased TM in POAG caused increased IOP. Simultaneously, pathology in the post-TM anterior sclera and intra-scleral distal outflow pathway has been implied with the level of disease here also being nearly equivalent to that of the TM itself. This observation coupled with recent and variably successful IOP lowering from minimally invasive glaucoma surgeries (MIGS), designed to simply bypass the TM, further confirms that IOP is more complex than just the TM. The global goal of this proposal entitled Discovery and Characterization of Anterior Sclera Pathology in Glaucoma is to identify novel, uncover the molecular mechanisms of, and realize the importance of continued impediments to aqueous humor outflow downstream of the TM in the anterior sclera and intra-scleral distal outflow pathway.  In Specific Aim 1, we will apply modern histological techniques to revisit prior and rudimentary suggestions of post-TM scleral and intra-scleral outflow pathway fibrosis and collapse.  In Specific Aim 2, we will evaluate the molecular mechanisms for scleral and intra-scleral distal outflow pathway fibrosis by applying knowledge regarding known pro-fibrotic agents such as TGF-ß in the TM to freshly harvested glaucomatous sclera obtained during canaloplasty surgery.  In Specific Aim 3, we will determine the impact of TGF-ß mediated fibrosis on sclera and the intra-scleral distal outflow pathway by studying permeability characteristics via newly generated glaucoma scleral cell lines and by the development of a new animal perfusion model.  This Mentored Clinical Scientist Research Career Development Award serves as a foundation and continuation of my MD/PhD completion with Dr. Solomon Snyder at the Solomon Snyder Department of Neuroscience at The Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, ophthalmology residency training at the Doheny Eye Institute at the University of Southern California (USC), and glaucoma fellowship tutelage under Dr. Robert Weinreb at the University of California, San Diego (UCSD).  I have now placed myself at USC as an Assistant Professor in Ophthalmology because USC has the track record, fresh experience with K-awardees, and excellent mentorship in Drs. David Hinton (Mentor), James Tan (Co-Mentor), and Robert Weinreb (Co-Mentor; at UCSD) to provide the additional research training and experience necessary to fuel my success. My career development plan will be built around my mentors and the Southern California Clinical and Translational Science Institute organized young investigator courses and responsible conduct in research training.  Through the completion of these studies we hope to (a) further basic understanding of aqueous humor outflow from the normal eye and (b) develop an improved insight into impediments of aqueous humor outflow in POAG to allow for future innovation of pharmacological and surgical glaucoma treatments. Furthermore, through this support, I will achieve my immediate goals of developing my research program and identity as well as establish the next step in my long-term goal of becoming an independently NIH-funded glaucoma health-oriented clinician-scientist researcher."
"9422992","Project Summary Gaucher disease (GD) is a genetic disease caused by mutations in the GBA1 gene which result in reduced enzymatic activity of ?-glucocerebrosidase (GCase); however, patients with the same GCase mutations may have significant variably in disease presentation, ranging from a life-threatening manifestation to almost asymptomatic. It is believed that the modifier genes are responsible for the extraordinarily diverse phenotypes among patients harboring identical GBA1 mutations. Thus, identification of new modifier genes in GD will provide invaluable information in understanding the pathogenesis of GD and in searching for novel diagnostic and therapeutic targets for GD. Our previous report that progranulin (PGRN) is therapeutic against inflammatory arthritis (Tang, et al. Science, 2011) prompted us to determine whether PGRN also played a role in lung inflammation using ovalbumin (OVA)-challenged asthma model, which led to the unexpected discovery of GRN (the gene encoding PGRN) as a novel gene in GD. PGRN null mice display typical features of GD, including ?wrinkled tissue paper? appearance of Gaucher cells in multiple organs, and tubular-like lysosome transformation in macrophages. In addition, serum PGRN levels of GD patients are significantly lower when compared to healthy controls, and lower PGRN level was significantly associated with the GRN variants identified in GD patients (Jian, et al, EBioMedicine, 2016a). PGRN binds directly to GCase, and its deficiency results in aggregation in the cytoplasm and defects in the lysosomal localization of GCase. Additionally, 98 C- terminal amino acids of PGRN, referred to as Pcgin, are required and sufficient for the binding to GCase. Pcgin effectively ameliorates the disease phenotype in GD patient fibroblasts and OVA-challenged GD model (Jian, et al, EBioMedicine, 2016b). There is an urgent unmet medical need for treating neuropathic GD, since current enzyme replacement therapy for GD cannot penetrate into brain. Excitingly, our preliminary data revealed that Pcgin could cross blood brain barrier and might be also therapeutic against neuropathic GD. In an effort to elucidate the molecular mechanism underlying PGRN- and Pcgin-mediated therapeutic effect against GD, we performed an unbiased proteomics screen, which led to the isolation of protein disulfide-isomerase A3 (PDIA3) as a PGRN and Pcgin co-bound molecule. In addition, loss of PDIA3 abolished Pcgin's therapeutic effects in GD patient fibroblasts. The hypothesis of this application is that PGRN is a novel modifier in GD and its derivative Pcgin is therapeutic against GD. The Specific Aims are: (1) To determine the therapeutic role of PGRN and its derivative Pcgin in GD, in particular against neuropathic GD; and (2) To elucidate the cellular and molecular mechanisms by which PGRN and Pcgin regulate GCase and GD, with special focus on their interactions with PDIA3 in GD. Completion of the proposed research will not only present PGRN as a novel modifier of GD, provide new insight into the molecular events in the pathogenesis of GD, but could also lead to the development of novel biologics for treating GD, in particular neuropathic GD."
"9397115","Project Summary/Abstract Insulin levels are inadequate to maintain euglycemia in patients with type-2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and in animal models of the disease, which is due in part to ?-cell dysfunction. While perturbations of ?-cell cation levels result in aberrant function, the identity and role(s) of the ion channels that contribute to defective ?-cell cation homeostasis during the pathogenesis of T2DM remain largely unknown. This is an important problem because, without this knowledge, our understanding of ?-cell dysfunction in T2DM is incomplete, which limits the targets that can be utilized for treating diabetes. The mucolipin subfamily of the transient receptor cation channels (TRPM) are key regulators of ?-cell function. The most abundant pancreatic islet TRPM channel, TRPM7 is essential for maintaining cellular Mg2+ homeostasis. The long term goal of this research is to under- stand physiological and pathophysiological ?-cell function in the context of TRPM7 channels. The overall ob- jective of this proposal is to elucidate the influence of pancreatic ?-cell TPRM7 channels on function and de- velopment. This project will test the central hypothesis that TRPM7 channel modulation of Mg2+ homeostasis controls ?-cell mass and function. This hypothesis has been formulated from preliminary data that finds that TRPM7 regulates ?-cell development, proliferation, Mg2+ content, Ca2+ influx and glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS). The rationale for the proposed project is that understanding how Mg2+ homeostasis is modu- lated by TRPM7 channel activity will expose new therapeutic targets aimed at improving approaches for gen- erating ?-cells from pluripotent cell sources for the treatment of T2DM. Guided by strong preliminary data, this hypothesis will be tested by pursuing two specific aims: 1) Determine how TRPM7 regulates pancreatic ?-cell development; and 2) Determine how TRPM7 modulates adult ?-cell function. Under the first aim, mice with to- tal pancreatic, total endocrine, or ?-cell specific ablation of TRPM7, which are already on hand, will be utilized to test how this channel regulates ?-cell development. This aim will also determine how TRPM7 activity modu- lates ?-cell cycle regulators, apoptosis and senescence. Under the second aim, transgenic mice with condi- tional ablation of ?-cell TRPM7, which are on hand, will be utilized to assess how TRPM7 modulation of Mg2+ homeostasis regulates glucose metabolism, cAMP, Ca2+ influx and GSIS. Furthermore, the function of hu- man??-cell TRPM7 channels will be assessed with pharmacology and a dominant negative (D/N) approach, which have been established as feasible in the applicants? hands. The proposed project is significant because the resulting data will illuminate mechanistic pathways for regulating GSIS and increasing ?-cell mass; it is es- sential for uncovering therapies for treating diabetes."
"9357515","DESCRIPTION (provided by the applicant): Incorporating patients' perspectives can improve healthcare research and delivery. When patients are included in healthcare research, they are empowered to ask and receive relevant answers to questions they have about their health. Patient-centered outcomes research (PCOR) is designed to provide meaningful evidence that enables informed healthcare decision making by patients and other stakeholders. The University of Maryland (UM) is applying the concept of continuous patient engagement to a long history of successful community based participatory research to propose an innovative approach to PATient-centered    Involvement in Evaluating the effectiveNess of Treatments (PATIENTS). PATIENTS is designed to enhance existing UM infrastructure to: (1) Foster sustainable partnerships with local, regional, and national communities of diverse patients and healthcare systems to improve PCOR, investigators' cultural competency and, ultimately, health outcomes; (2) Conduct and expand PCOR in partnership with patients and healthcare delivery systems that will better inform patient-centered health care decision making and healthcare systems design; and (3) Advance dissemination and implementation strategies for PCOR findings for patients, health care providers, and healthcare systems to utilize evidence-based interventions. A major focus of PATIENTS will be to select health outcomes and comparator interventions that matter to diverse patients or their surrogates, address the applicability and feasibility of PCOR across healthcare systems, and accelerate adoption of effective interventions through implementation science.         The cornerstone of the PATIENTS program is UM, including the Baltimore (UMB) and College Park (UMCP) campuses, the University of Maryland Medical Center (UMMC) and related clinics and hospitals within the UM network; however, it is the inclusion of diverse patient communities and healthcare systems into the infrastructure that will ensure meaningful stakeholder involvement. Four individual investigator research projects support the development of the PCOR infrastructure and add to the sustainability of partnerships."
"9482962","Summary: Area C: Genome-wide identification and targeting of resistance to cancer therapy The frequent emergence of resistance to anti-cancer therapies remains a major challenge in cancer treatment that is of utmost importance. Recent clinical and experimental studies addressing this problem require the arduous collection of pre- and post- treatment data for every new specific treatment and cancer type studied. Thus, a computational approach that can expedite the identification of molecular determinants of resistance via the analysis of existing large-scale cancer cohorts is called for.  Our proposal seeks to identify novel ways to counter de novo and acquired resistance through drug combinations. We focus on gene interactions rather than individual genes and leverage large scale genomic datasets and patient response data. Our approach is based on recent work in the Ruppin and other labs showing that genetic interactions can be computationally identified by analyzing omics tumor data.  To decipher pathways of resistance to cancer therapies, we focus here on studying a new type of genetic interactions, termed synthetic rescues (SRs). SRs denote a functional interaction between two genes whereby a fitness reducing change in the activity of one of the two genes (termed the vulnerable gene) is compensated by altered activity of another gene (termed the rescuer gene), which restores cell fitness and rescues it. We have recently developed tools for SR data-driven identification from large cancer tumors cohorts, successfully enabling the prediction of drug response and emergence of resistance in patients. Building on these transformational results the specific aims of this proposal are: Specific Aim 1. Perform a pan-cancer and cancer type-specific SR-based analyses, focusing on melanoma, breast, head and neck, and colon cancer, identifying the major rescuer genes in each cancer type, together with specific recommendations of combinatorial therapies mitigating resistance. Specific Aim 2. Develop a new version of SR analysis tools that will be made publically available for use by others in a standard, user friendly manner and includes analysis of gene methylation and genome wide mutation data, on top of other omics data already utilized in our previous SR inference tools. Specific Aim 3. Experimentally test predicted rescuer targets and combination therapies in patient derived resistant cancer cells.  Taken together the proposed study, will present a transformative SR based approach for identifying and targeting resistance pathways across the whole cancer genome."
"9348638","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A vicious cycle of inflammation and reduction-oxidation imbalance has recently been discovered as a critical aberration in a variety of chronic disease, including chronic kidney disease (CKD). In particular, the biomechanical, hormonal, and inflammatory insults to the kidney in the context of hypertension converge on production of reactive species and culminate in adverse fibrotic remodeling. Reactive species act not only as chemical agents indiscriminately damaging cellular constituents, but also as signaling molecules instigating highly specific changes in cellular behavior and differentiation. We have previously demonstrated that electrophilic nitro-fatty acids upregulate cytoprotective responses and allow cells to cope with oxidative insult. This family of compounds has also been shown to be tolerogenic, reducing leukocyte extravasation and cytokine production in macrophages. Our new preliminary data indicate that orally-administered nitro-oleic acid (NO2-OA) has renal protective effects in a deoxycorticosterone (DOCA)-salt model of murine hypertension. In this proposal, I seek to identify the mechanisms by which NO2-OA affords renal protection in hypertensive kidney injury. Specifically, I will investigate the therapeutic efficacy of NO2-OA on (1) hypertension-induced inflammatory response in the renal parenchyma and (2) antioxidant gene expression in renal fibrotic remodeling. Beyond evaluating a promising pharmacological candidate, the proposed studies will yield fundamental understanding of the role of reduction- oxidation imbalance in CKD. Overall, these studies will provide new functional and mechanistic insights into the pathogenesis of chronic kidney failure, and have the potential to uncover two novel pharmacologic strategies for treatment of this epidemic disease."
"9394729","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     RELEVANCE: This study will test a novel percutaneous osseointegrated prosthetic implant for transfemoral amputees as an alternative to a socket prosthetic limb attachment system. This work aims to address the complications associated with socket technology with a device that is implanted directly into the residual bone and can be used to improve the quality of life for Veterans amputees. Dr. Erik Kubiak and his collaborators have the clinical and research foundation on which to successfully complete this work.  The Department of Veterans Affairs currently provides care for over 340,000 individuals with limb loss. The rate of amputations within the U.S. military population has doubled over the past decade as a result of the Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom conflicts compared to previous wars. The majority of these amputees are eager to regain function but face ongoing burdens as a result of their limb loss. The current prosthetic socket system is fraught with complications and is difficul to use in cases where the residual limb is short and with multiple-limb loss. Commonly, socket wearers experience recurring complications, which include skin breakdown due to friction, discomfort, limb pain, infection, insecure socket fixation, and frequent re-fitting due to body mass changes. These challenges prohibit most amputees from comfortably wearing their prosthesis more than a few hours a day.  OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to test a novel percutaneous osseointegrated prosthetic implant in Veteran transfemoral amputees. The following specific aims will be tested:  AIMS: 1) Evaluate a new percutaneous prosthetic attachment system for safety in a limited  number of human subjects (N=10); 2) Optimize the surgical technique for implanting the  percutaneous osseointegrated prosthetic attachment system in a limited number of human  subjects; 3) Develop post-operative monitoring and rehabilitation techniques specific for subjects  implanted with this percutaneous osseointegrated device to measure efficacy; 4) Build the clinical  platform for transferring osseointegrated technology to other VA and military institutions.  METHODS: Ten subjects that have undergone transfemoral amputation not due to peripheral vascular disease, complications from diabetes, or infection will be enrolled at the George E.  Wahlen VA Medical Center, Salt Lake City, Utah. All subjects will receive the percutaneous osseointegrated device. The surgical protocol will consist of a two-stage procedure. The endo-prosthetic portion of the device will be implanted at Stage 1. The exo-prosthetic portion of the device will be implanted six weeks later to allow the soft tissue envelope to mature and regain a viable blood supply. Subjects will be systematically monitored for one year following the Stage 2 surgery for data collection. Subjects will be followed for life as part of routine clinical care. Each subject will undergo careful assessment prior to the implant surgery and during the one-year follow-up period. Radiographs, DEXA scanning, microbiology and validated tools for monitoring activity, impairment and patient satisfaction will be used to objectively quantify prosthetic utilization and patient quality of lif.  SIGNIFICANCE: The success of this novel percutaneous osseointegrated prosthetic device has the potential to significantly improve VA clinical care for amputees by reducing complications associated with traditional socket attachment system. This research would also greatly improve the Veteran's function and overall quality of life."
"9385256","Project Summary Nature uses vitamin B12 and its derivatives to perform fascinating chemical reactions that are essential for life. Enzymes that harness the reactivity of vitamin B12 are known for having dynamic transitions that move the co- factor between multiple sites in the protein. One such enzyme is the complex formed by the corrinoid iron-sul- fur protein and its methyltransferase (CFeSP/MeTr) from a microbial carbon ?xation pathway that is responsi- ble for producing an astounding 1012 kg of acetate annually. Microbes that utilize this pathway can be found in many contexts, including the human gut. Furthermore, a B12-dependent methyl transfer reaction is performed by the homologous enzyme methionine synthase (MetH) in humans to produce methionine from homocysteine. Prior studies of CFeSp/MeTr using X-ray crystallography suggest that large domain motions are an essential component of the enzyme turnover mechanism. Remarkably, enzyme turnover has been shown to occur within the crystal, and the motion of the B12 domain is the largest known for any protein in the crystalline state. We propose to develop new experimental and theoretical methods for X-ray scattering from MetH in solution and diffuse scattering from CFeSP/MeTr crystals to understand how long-ranged correlated motions in B12-depen- dent metalloenzymes regulate catalytic activity."
"9391612","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):      Skeletal muscle atrophy represents an enormous unmet medical need in Veteran patients. Frequent causes of skeletal muscle atrophy include orthopedic injuries, bed rest, advanced age, cancer, heart failure, COPD, diabetes, stroke, renal failure, critical illness and spinal cord injuy. Effects of skeletal muscle atrophy include weakness, reduced activity, falls, fractures, debilitation, prolonged hospitalization and rehabilitation, nursing home placement, and increased mortality. Although skeletal muscle atrophy has broad clinical impact in the Veteran population, a pharmacologic therapy for muscle atrophy does not exist, and current therapeutic approaches (nutrition and physical rehabilitation) are often ineffective and/or unfeasible. Our long-term goal is to develop a pharmacologic therapy for skeletal muscle atrophy. In preliminary studies, we studied human subjects to determine mRNA expression signatures of human skeletal muscle atrophy, and then used these signatures in conjunction with a novel drug discovery method to identify two small molecules (ursolic acid and compound A) as predicted pharmacologic inhibitors of human skeletal muscle atrophy. Using mouse models, we found that ursolic acid and compound A prevent and reverse skeletal muscle atrophy, increase muscle strength, and improve exercise capacity. In addition to these effects in mice, we found that ursolic acid and compound A stimulate growth of human skeletal myotubes, an in vitro model of human skeletal muscle. Importantly, data from us and others suggest that ursolic acid and compound A have favorable safety profiles, suggesting good potential for translation to Veteran patients. Although these data identify ursolic acid and compound A as exciting potential therapeutic agents to prevent and reverse skeletal muscle atrophy in Veteran patients, some critical questions remain unanswered. For example, we do not yet understand how ursolic acid and compound A reduce muscle atrophy and improve muscle function. In addition, ursolic acid and compound A are structurally dissimilar and exhibit some differences in their physiological and biochemical effects, suggesting that the combination of ursolic acid and compound A could be more beneficial than either compound alone. To determine mechanisms of action and potential for combination therapy, we propose two aims. In Specific Aim 1, we will use human skeletal myotubes to determine cellular mechanisms that ursolic acid and compound A utilize to increase muscle mass and improve muscle function. Since skeletal muscle mass and function are tightly linked to skeletal muscle protein, mitochondria and anabolic signaling, we will test th hypotheses that ursolic acid and compound A increase the net balance of protein synthesis to protein degradation, increase mitochondrial mass and respiration, and stimulate anabolic signaling. Collectively, these studies will provide an important mechanistic foundation for clinica studies of ursolic acid and compound A in patients with skeletal muscle atrophy. In Specific Aim 2, we will use mouse models to determine if the combination of ursolic acid and compound A is more beneficial than either compound alone. We will test the hypotheses that the combination of ursolic acid and compound A prevents and reverses skeletal muscle atrophy, increases strength, and improves exercise capacity more than either compound alone. If the combination of ursolic acid and compound A demonstrates additional benefit in muscle atrophy, combination therapy would be carried forward to clinical studies. Through these studies, we hope to develop new therapeutic agents for skeletal muscle atrophy, and quality of life of many Veteran patients. a common and debilitating condition that diminishes the health"
"9563046","Project Summary/Abstract  The goal of the project is to develop a model that explains the processes by which decisions are made about information that is continuously distributed across one-dimensional and two-dimensional spaces, with responses made on continuous scales. Large comprehensive bodies of data will be collected in the domains of decision- making in perception, long-term memory, working memory, and numerosity and these will allow tight constraints on the theoretical assumptions of the modeling. The model will provide a unified explanation of the full range of data for continuous tasks, including accuracy, the distributions of response times for correct and incorrect responses, how they change with manipulations of independent variables, and how they differ among individuals and groups of individuals. Statistical properties of the model will be examined and the numbers of observations needed in experiments with clinical and other populations will be examined. The model and the data collected to test it will be completely new to decision-making research.  Four populations of adults will be studied, young adults, unimpaired older adults, adults with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), and adults with early Alzheimer's Disease (AD). The aim will be to understand how normal aging affects individual components of processing in continuous decision-making and how MCI and early AD affect the components. Almost no research has been conducted with AD and MCI patients modeling the time course of decision-making. It is not known if the components of decision-making are the same as those for adults who are not cognitively impaired or how independent variables affect their accuracy and RTs or whether a modeling approach can uncover preserved skills not discernible from accuracy and RT data alone. 1"
"9440897","ABSTRACT Recipients of a kidney transplant from an African-American deceased donor have worse outcomes than their counterparts receiving an organ from a White deceased donor. The extent to which this is due to the presence of high-risk APOL1 genotypes in African-American donors is unknown. Several recent studies have found a positive association between high-risk APOL1 genotypes and graft failure, but these have been based on relatively few events, have come primarily from a few large centers, and have not analyzed donor-recipient pairs. The proposed studies will investigate the association of a kidney donor's APOL1 status with recipient outcomes. We will also study estimate the impact of APLO1 status on living donor outcomes. We have assembled a consortium including 6 organ procurement organizations covering 7 states in the Upper Midwest, 123 recovering hospitals, 25 transplant centers and collaborators in transplant surgery, transplant nephrology, epidemiology and genetics to achieve these goals. These findings will provide a greater understanding of the impact of the presence of high-risk APOL1 variants in both recipients and living donors. These data are needed for informed decision-making for recipients, potential living donors, and their caregivers. Both the relative and absolute risk of clinically significant events associated with high-risk APOL1 variants will be estimated with much greater precision that previous studies, allowing more informed decisions on acceptance of specific organs for transplantation."
"9449816","Project Summary More than 415,000 children live in foster care in the US, 58% of whom are racial and ethnic minorities, a rate that is disproportionate compared to the general population. As many as 40% of children entering foster care have special healthcare needs, and when foster placements change, children live with new caregivers and change primary care and subspecialty healthcare providers. Often these transitions are not coordinated, resulting in gaps in healthcare and poorer health. Teens in foster care are at even greater risk because they spend more time in foster care, experience placement instability, and age out of foster care without an adult to assist them with navigating the healthcare system. As a result, teens in foster care report being disconnected from primary and non-emergency healthcare, and experience poor health well into adulthood. While the risks for poor life-long health are clear, patterns of healthcare utilization and types of healthcare services accessed by teens in foster care are not known. Further, it is unclear what impact foster care placement instability has on healthcare utilization while teens are in foster care. It is critical to understand patterns of healthcare utilization for youth while they are in foster care so that healthcare providers and systems can anticipate and optimize the services foster youth receive and begin to address significant health disparities for these vulnerable youth. This study draws on secondary data analysis of administrative child welfare records of children ages 16-21 in foster care between 2012 and 2016 from a single county in Ohio. Data have been linked to electronic medical records to provide a retrospective medical and social history for 1,023 foster youth, with a mean age of 18. Foster youth will be matched to 1023 youth without foster care experience. Half (52%) of youth are women, and 78% are minorities. Healthcare utilization will be assessed by examining healthcare days ? the number of days per month that teens encounter the healthcare system. Healthcare days serve as a proxy for healthcare expenditures (e.g., cost of primary care visit) and loss of productivity (e.g., time away from school or work) for youth and caregivers, which have social and economic costs. The study has three aims. Aim 1: Determine the impact of mandated healthcare visits and placement changes on existing patterns of healthcare use, and isolate the impact of repeated placement changes on long-term shifts in patterns of use among foster care youth. Aim 2: Determine the effects of patient characteristics, resources, and need on healthcare utilization for adolescents who are in foster care. Aim 3: Identify differences in the effects of patient and environmental characteristics that lead to healthcare days for youth who are and are not in foster care, examining total, scheduled, unscheduled and unattended scheduled healthcare days per month. Additional analyses will examine the unique contribution of minority status on placement disruptions and patterns of healthcare use, as minority youth are more likely to experience placement changes and have poorer educational, occupational, and health outcomes."
"9315705","The opioid abuse epidemic has grown rapidly and disproportionately across the US in recent years. Pennsylvania (PA) has been greatly affected by the epidemic; hospitalizations for prescription opioid and heroin overdoses increased by 285 and 315%, respectively, in PA rural counties between 2000 and 2014, compared to 208 and 143% in urban counties. The prevalence of opioid use disorders (OUD) among the Medicaid population has increased in all PA counties except for Philadelphia; however, the health system in rural PA has lacked the capacity to address this need. The typical rural county targeted by this intervention has only one primary care provider who prescribes buprenorphine. The objective of this project is to double the number of primary care physicians delivering high-quality medication-assisted treatment (MAT) in rural PA by implementing and testing a state-led, multi-faceted intervention. Led by the PA Department of Human Services (DHS), the three aims of this project are to 1) Implement solutions to overcoming barriers to implementation of MAT in primary care; 2) Evaluate the effect of the multi-faceted intervention to expand MAT in rural primary care practices on supply of MAT providers and access to high-quality MAT for Medicaid beneficiaries with OUD; and 3) Disseminate findings to state and national stakeholders, and adopt successful program strategies as evidence-based policies in PA Medicaid. Participating practices will be trained to provide MAT consistent with current American Society of Addiction Medicine guidelines. Five intervention components will be available to all primary care practices recruited to participate. 1) An Implementation Team, including MAT and primary care practice management experts, who will assist providers in adding MAT services to their practice; 2) A Training Remote Infusion of MAT program, where practices will remotely join presentations by addiction experts to review complex opioid case studies to improve their own treatment capabilities; 3) A Peer-to-Peer Tele- consultation that participating providers can use to speak with an on-call addiction specialist who will offer insight and expert advice on complex patients and MAT; 4) A Substance Use Disorder (SUD) Health Home hub that will provide care management services for participating practices; and 5) Tele-psychiatry Coordination, where the SUD Health Home care management team will coordinate tele-psychiatry services for patients of participating practices. The intervention will be evaluated using a mixed-methods approach including qualitative, survey, and claims-based analyses. Qualitative data from participating physicians and staff will be continually collected. Claims-based measures will include supply, prevalence, utilization, and outcome variables that will be compared to PA counties that did not receive the intervention using interrupted time series and difference-in-difference analyses. Finally, a Medicaid beneficiary patient survey will measure changes in perceived access to and experience with MAT. DHS will disseminate program materials and will implement successful strategies from the project into evidence-based policies."
"9382328","Project Summary Eukaryotic genomes are organized into active and inactive domains referred to euchromatin and heterochromatin. This functional organization plays an important role in chromosome segregation, telomere maintenance and genome stability. A key component of heterochromatin are the HP-1 family of proteins, which bind to a histone 3 lysine-9 methyl mark and act as a platform for diverse regulators. A biochemical activity thought to be important for the spread of heterochromatin is the ability of HP-1 proteins to polymerize. Recent work on the fission yeast HP-1 protein, Swi6, reveals that polymerization is regulated by autoinhibition. A critical and poorly understood question is the extent of the conformational transition between closed, inactive and open, active forms of Swi6 that drive heterochromatin spread. This gap in knowledge derives from the fact that HP-1 proteins and their complexes with nucleosomes are conformationally dynamic in solution and difficult to crystallize. Here we will define the structural dynamics of the Swi6-chromatin complex and link the structural states to function. In Aim 1 we will determine the structure of the autoinhibited form of Swi6 using an integrated modeling approach that employs restraints NMR spectroscopy and small-angle x-ray scattering in solution (SAXS). The biological significance of the structural models will be tested in gene silencing assays in the fission yeast S. pombe. In Aim 2, we will determine the degree of conformational rearrangements of chromatin when Swi6 engages the nucleosome to form a spreading competent state. The structure and dynamics of the nucleosome-Swi6 complex will be interrogated by a combination of biophysical methods, such as Methyl-TROSY NMR and HD-exchange mass-spectrometry (MS), that can provide residue specific structural information in solution. Cross-linking mass-spectrometry in conjunction with cryoEM will be employed to obtain models of the spreading competent form if Swi6 bound to nucleosomes. This approach will shed insights into conformational control of heterochromatin formation by Swi6 in fission yeast and provide a conceptual foundation for how heterochromatin is regulated in human cells."
"9451507","PROJECT SUMMARY Breast cancer is the second leading cause of cancer-related death and the leading cause of premature mortality for women in the U.S. Women who are racial/ethnic minorities experience an unequal burden of the disease. Breast cancer screening mammography guidelines for women aged 40-49 years are controversial. The potential benefit of avoiding an advanced cancer is often emphasized, while minimizing the frequency of possible harms. Conflicting recommendations for age at initiation and frequency of screening mammography for women aged 40-49 years highlight concerns related to the benefits and harms of screening. These conflicting recommendations leave women confused about when to initiate screening, how often to be screened, what sources to trust, and can undermine informed decision-making about screening mammography. Women from diverse racial/ethnic groups and those with limited health literacy are particularly vulnerable to misunderstanding screening recommendations. Health literacy is the degree to which one has the ability to obtain, process, understand, and use health information and services in order to make appropriate health decisions. Those with limited health literacy have difficulty navigating the health care system, making health care decisions, and utilizing cancer screening, all contributing to disparities in cancer care. Health literacy is often a more powerful predictor of health disparities than more well-established predictors such as education and race/ethnicity. Moreover, individuals from traditionally medically underserved communities (e.g., racial/ethnic minority, low socioeconomic status [SES]) are at higher risk for lower health literacy, which can also reduce participation in cancer screening. This project will compare the intersections and differences between how Latina, Black, and non-Latina White women consider the benefits and harms associated with breast cancer screening mammography. The goal of this project is to create decision support tools for Latina, Black, and non-Latina White women with varying levels of health literacy under age 50 considering breast cancer screening mammography."

"9467870","Project Summary/Abstract More than 7 million esophagogastroduodenoscopies (EGDs) are performed in the US annually, largely to screen for pathology in patients with chronic Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD). The vast majority of these EGDs find no disease nor require clinical intervention. Based on Medicare reimbursement estimates, substantial savings can be achieved by reducing the number of EGDs performed in these patients. In addition to this direct monetary cost-savings, reducing the number of EGDs would yield a reduction in the indirect costs associated with the procedure, such as time lost from work for the patient and persons accompanying the patient, sedation, and recovery. Moreover, the potential patient benefits of the EGDs are currently diminished by the limited diagnostic accuracy resulting from the random nature of esophagus biopsy sampling. We propose to develop and prototype a diagnostic tool, in the form of an ingestible tethered capsule, which would be swallowed (temporarily) by the patient and which would optically map the histologically relevant tissue properties of the esophagus epithelium in real time, based on scanned elastic-scattering spectroscopy (ESS) measurements. These types of pathology maps would be valuable in two clinical settings: one aimed at the primary care physician (PCP), to establish the presence of esophagitis and/or Barrett?s esophagus, the second aimed at the management of those diseases by gastroenterologists. This proposal focuses on the implementation for PCPs, by which the device could serve for preliminary screening to rule out the presence of Barrett?s esophagus (BE) and/or esophagitis in patients with symptoms of GERD. Only about 20% of patients with chronic GERD are found to have BE at time of endoscopy. Thus, our envisioned device could potentially eliminate the need for EGD, which is the current standard of care, in up to 80% of patients with symptomatic reflux. Integrated video imaging capabilities in the tethered capsule will also enable visual inspection of the esophagus, without the cost of endoscopy, and will enable the co-registration and documentation of esophageal ESS findings. As a future extension of the technology, in the hands of a gastroenterologist, the capability of the system to distinguish dysplasia within BE (which requires prompt treatment) can provide added value by helping the GI endoscopist to better target biopsies to areas of dysplasia. This would lead to a reduction in the number of negative biopsies generated in standard random- biopsy protocols, while increasing the probability of finding conditions that require treatment, by dramatically increasing the pre-biopsy probability of detecting dysplastic tissue. Aims 1 and 2a will concentrate on device design and prototype fabrication; Aim 2b will be a small clinical study to assess device design attributes and user experience; and Aim 3 will be a larger clinical study to assess the potential to provide real-time guidance to the PCP for decisions about referral to GI endoscopy."
"9348403","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):      PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs) hold great promise as a means of providing a noninvasive window into the status of the cochlea that can both advance our scientific knowledge about cochlear function, and contribute a rapid test of hearing impairment to the clinical armamentarium. However, when measured at recommended primary-tone levels of about f1=65 and f2=55 dB SPL in patients with sensorineural hearing loss such as Veterans, poor signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) often make clinical interpretations difficult. DPOAEs elicited by higher primary levels have better SNRs, but are both less sensitive and less frequency specific due to the associated basal spread of both excitation and DPOAE components. If these shortcomings could be overcome, the applicability of DPOAEs in the clinic would be greatly enhanced. The primary significance of the proposed program of research is to further our knowledge of ear-canal DPOAEs vs intracochlear DPs (iDPs) to improve DP-grams measured at moderate to high primary-tone levels for clinical purposes by: 1) understanding the basis of the apparent increase in frequency specificity of the ¿-oct IT procedure by simultaneous measures of both the DPOAE and direct observations of the effects of the IT on f2 and iDP near the basilar membrane (BM) in a gerbil model; 2) comparing these intracochlear measures to those obtained with a noninvasive iDP technique where an f3 tone is paired with the iDP to produce a DPOAE´ used to infer the behavior of the iDP. This comparison will establish the validity of the noninvasive ear-canal method for examining the behavior of iDPs, and determine the differences between DPOAEs and iDPs; and 3) simultaneously measuring the response/growth or input/output functions for both the ear-canal DPOAE´ and the iDP using direct intracochlear pressure measures near the BM. With this approach, transfer functions for the DPOAE´ can be developed that predict the behavior of the iDP inside the cochlea. The planned studies will also compare the performance of the standard DP-gram procedure to two new procedures, the ¿-oct IT DP- gram and the iDP-gram in a population of Veterans with noise-induced audiometric notches in the 4- to 6-kHz range. On the whole, the premise of the proposed experiments is that by determining the differences between conventional ear-canal DPOAEs and iDPs generated within the cochlea, a means towards improving the frequency specificity of clinical DP-gram tests obtained with moderate- to high-level primary tones will be provided. Accomplishing a more frequency-specific DP-gram will allow clinicians to reliably establish the pattern of outer hair cell damage using high-level primary tones to achieve adequate SNRs in Veterans with sensorineural hearing loss."
"9348675","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and next-generation sequencing are now commonplace despite a lack of comprehensive bioinformatics approaches for relating genotype to phenotype. The common method of analysis is to employ parametric statistics and then adjust for the large number of tests performed to limit false-positives. This agnostic approach is preferred by some because no assumptions are made about which genes or genomic regions might be important. The goal of our proposed research program continuation is to develop and evaluate a bioinformatics approach that analyzes genetic associations in the context of expert knowledge about biochemical pathways, gene function and experimental results using gene set enrichment (GSE) methods. An important challenge for success in this domain is the quality of the expert knowledge that is available in public databases such as Gene Ontology (GO). We first propose to develop and evaluate a novel Data-driven Ontology Refinement Algorithm (DORA) for improving the quality of genetic and genomic annotations (AIM 1). Improving the quality of annotations will in turn improve GSE results. We will then develop a comprehensive bioinformatics approach to the analysis of high-throughput genetic association results that considers functional DNA elements, genes, and gene function as important contexts. We will first determine whether considering data from the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) database improves GSE analysis at the level of gene regions (AIM 2). Next we will determine whether using GO annotations refined by our novel DORA algorithm (DORA-GO) improves GSE analysis at the gene set level above and beyond that provided by GO (AIM 3). We will determine the validity of these methods by assessing the replication of the results in independent data (AIM 4). AIMS 1-4 will be accomplished using several large population-based genetic studies of pre-clinical cardiovascular disease (CVD) as measured by left ventricular mass (LVM). Our working hypothesis is that we will obtain more replicated and hence more real genetic associations using our novel bioinformatics methods that embrace, rather than ignore, prior biological knowledge."
"9356811","Abstract  Seven medications have been approved for the treatment of tobacco addiction in the United States, five that are nicotine replacement and two are non-nicotine. Three of the NRT products (i.e. patch, gum, lozenge) are available as over-the-counter (OTC) products because clinical trials have shown that they are safe and effective without healthcare provider involvement.  After multiple studies, including one of the largest smoking cessation trials (`EAGLES' study) ever conducted, the evidence is clear that varenicline has the greatest probability of helping the most smokers quit and results in adverse events that are no worse than current OTC NRT products.  Given these data, the time has come to explore whether varenicline is safe and effective as an OTC medication. In addition, because earlier research found that .5mg twice a day (b.i.d.) varenicline is as effective as the currently FDA-approved 1.0mg b.i.d but with lower incidence of nausea and sleep disturbance, there is value in assessing whether the lower dose will work as well as the higher dose in an OTC environment. Thus, the primary goal of the proposed research is to test whether varenicline is a solid candidate for switching from prescription (Rx) to OTC, and whether a dose lower than that currently approved is as effective in an OTC environment. To understand the within- person mechanisms explaining how and when OTC varenicline might improve cessation outcomes, we also propose to assess experience with OTC varenicline via (a) ecological momentary assessment (EMA) and (b) interviews in a subset of participants."

"9466186","PROJECT SUMMARY Loss-of-function mutation of the Methyl CpG Binding Protein 2 (MECP2) gene causes a severe neurodevelopmental disorder known as Rett syndrome (RTT), while duplication of its locus leads to MECP2 Duplication syndrome (MDS). Children with each diagnosis can present with profound intellectual disability for which there is currently no treatment. Here we provide preliminary data showing that expression of the metabotropic glutamate receptor 7 (mGlu7), a receptor with known roles in synaptic plasticity and cognition, is altered downstream of changes in MECP2 gene dosage. While potentiation of mGlu7 activity ameliorates phenotypes in RTT mice, the therapeutic potential of mGlu7 modulation in a model of MDS remains unexplored. Completion of this research proposal will thoroughly investigate the efficacy of mGlu7 modulation in paradigms of learning and memory in a mouse model of MDS and provide new mechanistic insight into the neurophysiological role of mGlu7 in the context of MeCP2-related disorders."

"9355049","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):      Peripheral nerve damage is a consequence of blast injury to the extremities of soldiers and a secondary outcome following cervical spinal cord injury. Functional recovery from peripheral nerve damage is often poor, resulting in impaired motor function, sensory loss, and pain. Clinical complexity and prognosis for recovery is further compounded for Veterans, whose injuries are surgically repaired or revised following separation from the armed forces. This timeline results in a chronic nerve injury, which results in a fundamentally different clinical scenario from acute injury, and one for which therapeutic and rehabilitative strategies are lacking. The significance of strategies for enhancing function of chronically denervated nerves for a Veteran's population is highlighted by the prioritization of nerve regeneration and spinal cord rehabilitation by the VA RR&D Spinal Cord Injury and Regenerative Medicine Program.  We have developed an innovative strategy for nerve regeneration that takes advantage of the inherent capacity of intact proximal nerve stumps to grow in response to tensile deformation (stretch). Our novel, modular internal-fixator device lengthens the proximal stump towards the distal stump in a controlled manner, and will facilitate reconnectivity of nerve stumps more rapidly than other strategies, including gold- standard autologous grafts. Importantly, this acceleration of nerve regeneration will also enable more distal connectivity, which is particularly  crucial to bypass large swaths of the distal stump of chronically injured nerves, which severely inhibits regeneration. We hypothesize that more rapid and more distal reconnectivity will, in turn,  enhance motor and sensory functional recovery.  Towards these goals, we will use an integrative, cross-disciplinary approach to address two specific aims. In Aim 1, we will examine the impact of moderate levels of tensile loading on nerve regeneration and functional recovery in moderate 10mm rat sciatic defects, following acute injury and chronic denervation. In this animal model, which allows us to efficiently and practically test our proposed concept, we hypothesize that in both acute and chronic injury groups, moderate levels of continuous nerve strain imposed on the proximal nerve stump will accelerate nerve regeneration as well as sensory and motor functional recovery compared to autologous grafts. Efficacy will be evaluated statistically by comparing a comprehensive battery of biological, structural, and functional outcomes. In Aim 2, we will examine the impact of moderate levels of tensile loading on nerve regeneration and functional recovery in massive 20mm rabbit sciatic nerve defects, following chronic denervation. The longer length scale in a rabbit model creates a more clinically relevant regenerative challenge, and also enables direct measurement of nerve conduction velocity across the injury site. Based on comparison of biological, structural, and functional outcomes, we predict that lengthened nerves will display dramatically enhanced regeneration and functional recovery across a 20mm gap following chronic denervation, compared to gaps repaired with autologous grafts.  Successful completion of our proposed aims will demonstrate the feasibility and efficacy of nerve lengthening as a novel strategy for regeneration of previously irreparable injured peripheral nerves. We anticipate that these efforts will contribute to improved motor and sensory recovery for injured Veterans."
"9351287","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In the United States, there is a 1 in 4 risk of developing depression by age 75, and by 2030 depression will be one of the leading causes of disease burden world-wide. For the past half-decade, the treatment of depression has been dominated by drugs that affect a group of molecules called the monoamines, with serotonin being the most commonly targeted. While effective for some people (30-50%), those that remain without relief have few options for therapy, as newer drug strategies have been hard to come by. Within the last few decades, it has become more and more apparent that changes in the activity and connections within the brain heavily influence the development of depression. Specifically, the hippocampus, a brain region important for emotion and memory, has been shown to be integral to depression's development. Our lab studies a unique protein in the brain called the Hyperpolarization-activated Cyclic-Nucleotide gated channel (HCN), which helps to regulate the flow of electricity from cell to cell. By doing this, the channel has an integral rolein solidifying and maintaining the connections between individual neurons and, ultimately, whole brain regions. Recently, we and others showed that a loss of these channels in the hippocampus has a distinct antidepressant-like effect in mice. Given this finding, we propose to study the roles of HCN in the development and treatment of depression, and hypothesize that HCN channels increase with depression-like behavior, and reduction of HCN channels correlate with a reduction in depression-like behavior. Specifically, we hypothesize that HCN is increased with depression-like behavior in chronically stressed mice (Aim1), that HCN subunit knock- out protects stressed mice from depression-like behavior (Aim 2.1), viral overexpression of HCN subunits in the hippocampus increase depression-like behavior (Aim 2.2), and antidepressants decrease HCN subunits (Aim 3)."
"9542971","Environmental arsenic (As) is a class I human carcinogen with established roles in promoting skin, bladder, lung and kidney cancers. The role of arsenic as a breast carcinogen is less established although numerous studies have indicated that in cell cultures As promotes the specification of breast cancer cells towards phenotypes that are estrogen receptor negative as well as more lethal and challenging to treat. The molecular mechanisms involved remain unknown. Our laboratory found that As promotes alterations in the metabolism of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) via inhibiting the tumor suppressor Sirtuin 3 which leads to the accumulation of manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) in an acetylated/inactive form (MnSOD-Ac), increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the activation of hypoxia induced factor 2? (HIF2?). The activation of HIF2? is a well-established mechanism of stem cell reprogramming that has also been implicated in metastatic recurrence, as well as treatment failure in women with breast cancer. Hence, we propose that chronic As exposure is a risk factor for the development of ER(-) breast cancer via a mechanism that involves MnSOD acetylation and mitochondrial ROS. By extension, we propose that the MnSOD-Ac/HIF2? molecular signature may identify women with breast cancer that have been exposed to As and who may require personalized care for they are at increased risk of failing standard therapeutics. Also, that the MnSOD-Ac/HIF2? may be targeted to improve therapy in these women. Our aims are as follows: (1) determine if MnSOD-Ac reprograms tumor cell to stem-like (more aggressive) phenotypes associated with chemoresistance and if targeting MnSOD-Ac reverses this effect. (2) determine if low level arsenic exposure in the drinking water transforms ER+ in situ xenograph tumors developing in mice towards more pervasive phenotypes. (3) determine if there is an association between arsenic exposure and more aggressive subtypes of breast cancer with a MnSOD-Ac, or MnSOD-ROS-HIF2? molecular signature as well as if arsenic exposure promotes chemoresistance or a prevalence of aggressive ER(-) phenotypes."
"9564495","Project Summary  Falls are the leading cause of unintentional fatal and non-fatal injuries in older adults. Prevention of fall injuries is a national public health priority (Healthy People 2020 Objective IVP-23.2 and OA-11). To date, most of the studies on elderly falls were conducted in urban neighborhoods. Little is known about the differences in circumstances and consequences of falls among older adults living in rural versus urban neighborhoods. To our knowledge, no study on falls has examined how older adults' space and time use differ in rural and urban neighborhoods, and how such differences are related to risk of falling. This project will investigate 1) the rural- urban differences in time and space use among older adults; and 2) how time and space use influences risks for indoor and outdoor falls among older adults living in different neighborhood environments.  We propose to establish a longitudinal cohort of 1,200 older adults age 65 years and older in Worcester County and surrounding towns, including 400 each from urban, suburban and rural neighborhood strata, and composed of at least 33% racial/ethnic minorities. Participants will be followed for three years. Fall events will be tracked using monthly falls calendar and follow-up telephone/online surveys. During the first year, once in late spring/summer/early fall and once in late fall/winter/early spring, participant mobility patterns with respect to space, frequency and duration will be measured using a global positioning system (GPS) unit, and participant timing, frequency, duration and intensity of indoor and outdoor activities will be concurrently measured using a accelerometer (ACC). Between months 18 and 30 the participants will wear the GPS and ACC devices a third time with 50% of the participants randomized to wear the devices during the late spring/summer/early fall seasons and 50% randomized to wear them in the late fall/winter/early spring seasons. During the follow-up years 2 and 3, participants will be followed using mail or online surveys twice a year querying their time and space use and health status. The GPS and ACC data will be integrated with participant reported health, perception and behavioral data as well as neighborhood environment data. The data will be analyzed to achieve the following goals:  Aim 1: To quantify the rural-urban differences in space and time use among older adults.  Aim 2: To identify predictors of space and time use, with a focus on modifiable factors.  Aim 3: To examine rural-urban disparities in fall risks in relation to patterns of space and time use.  Aim 4: To examine sex and racial disparities in fall risks in relation to space and time use.  Results from this research will inform the design of community-based programs for promoting active living and preventing falls that will be effective across the rural-urban continuum."

"9241166","Abstract: The exponential increase of diabetics and the elderly in the U.S. has more than tripled the number of cataract surgeries performed in just two decades. As many as half of these surgeries will lead to posterior capsular opacification (PCO), which requires follow-up Nd:YAG laser capsulotomy surgery. Without this additional procedure, patients can suffer permanent vision loss and disability. In many countries laser capsulotomy is not available, and PCO results in blindness. As the primary complication of cataract surgery, PCO results in >$350 million in annual costs for the U.S. Medicare system alone. Costs are expected to exceed $1 billion by 2050. The number of diagnosed diabetics in the U.S. has far out-paced predictions. This group experiences high rates of cataract formation with more difficult recovery from surgery. If current trends continue, as many as one out of three Americans could be diabetic by mid-century, which will place increasing financial stress on our healthcare system. It is estimated that over 90% of the world?s visually impaired are living in developing countries and follow-up laser capsulotomy surgery is rarely an option in these areas; therefore, patients experience vision loss and/or blindness due to lack of resources. It is thus important to eradicate PCO globally. Ideally, no follow-up surgery would be required after the initial cataract removal.  An IOL that eliminates PCO would greatly reduce health risks and costs associated with cataract surgeries. PCO results from migration of lens epithelial cells (LECs) behind the intraocular lens (IOL). These cells cause the opacification of the posterior lens capsule that impairs vision. Sharklet Technologies proposes to continue development of a next-generation IOL that will prevent PCO, and to team with an industry partner to market the device in the U.S. and worldwide. The market is continually seeking improvements in IOL materials, especially in elimination of glistenings that cause decreased contrast sensitivity and result in loss of vision quality. This ClearSight IOL will be the first IOL to thus provide truly clear vision via three key features: 1) an outer ring and membrane that maintain capsular bag expansion and prevent equatorial LECs from migrating along the posterior surface of the capsular bag, 2) the Sharklet pattern that further inhibits migration of LECs into the visual axis, and 3) a novel material formulation that is free of glistenings. Our Phase I SBIR studies exceeded milestones, demonstrating statistically significant reduction in LEC migration in vitro (80% reduction) and PCO in rabbits (100% reduction in visually significant PCO). We are making rapid progress in our Phase II project to manufacture ClearSight IOLs and an accompanying injector and validate the safety and efficacy of these designs in anticipation of submitting a regulatory package for an Investigational Device Exemption for human clinical studies on the ClearSight IOL. Phase I and II success and the broad-based technical, clinical, and business skills of our expert, multi-disciplinary team sets the stage for a successful commercialization project to complete pilot clinical studies and obtain a CE Mark for our device, allowing us to move into post-market studies to support regulatory approval in the U.S."
"9468143","Project Summary/Abstract  Many negative outcomes of poor health decisions disproportionately affect minorities and individuals with low socioeconomic status (SES) (Kim et al., 2016; Krishnan et al., 2010). Yet virtually all the research on neural processes underlying responses to persuasive messages has ignored sociocultural context. This project examines the extent to which brain networks linked to evaluating self-relatedness, subjective value, social norms, and others' beliefs contributes to successful behavior change. It also examines the degree to which these brain networks differ across sociocultural contexts, and whether differences in network connectivity explain SES differences in how successful different types of persuasive messages are in promoting behavior change. This proposal combines methods from multiple important and emerging subfields at the forefront of neuroscience research in the 21st century, including network neuroscience, communication neuroscience, and cultural neuroscience.  The current proposal will include three studies. In Study 1, we will recruit high and low SES participants and measure brain activity while they evaluate personal and social health messages about reducing sugar consumption. Study 2 will consist of secondary analyses of an NIH funded study conducted in our group that had participants evaluate persuasive health messages about increasing physical activity (unpublished data). Study 3 will consist of secondary analyses of an NIH funded study conducted in our group that had participants evaluate persuasive health messages about quitting smoking (Falk et al., 2015). I will first test whether the fit between message content (personal vs. social) and SES influences whether people change their behavior (Aim 1). Next, I will use non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) machine learning algorithms to examine whether dynamic network connectivity in vmPFC, dmPFC, and TPJ predicts health behavior change (Aim 2). Finally, I will use NMF machine-learning algorithms to test for SES differences in the relationship between dynamic network connectivity and health behavior change (Aim 3).  This research has the potential to advance understanding of how brain networks contribute to behavior change as well as how these networks are influenced by sociocultural factors. This work can help promote healthy behaviors in health disparity populations, thereby helping to reduce health disparities. Directly examining how people from diverse sociocultural backgrounds?especially individuals from health disparity populations?process persuasive health messages promises to improve our understanding of how to design more effective health messages, promote healthy behaviors in minority and low SES groups, and reduce health disparities."
"9446623","SUMMARY Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is an aggressive malignancy in which limited treatment options are further compromised by treatment resistance. Immunotherapy, particularly against the PD-1/PD-L1 immune checkpoint, has transformed NSCLC treatment with durable responses and comparatively minimal side effects in both second-line treatment of metastatic disease and, recently, first line therapy. Despite these impressive responses there are equally impressive but poorly defined intrinsic and/or acquired resistance mechanisms. Across solid tumor types, the response rate targeting the PD-1 axis in unselected patients is only ~20-30%. In previously untreated NSCLC, the overall response rate (ORR) to the anti-PD-1 antibody pembrolizumab is only ~45% even with patient pre-selection for >50% IHC PD-L1 tumor positivity, PD-L1 negative patients also exhibit anti-tumor response and the active search for alternative biomarkers of response in NSCLC has been unfulfilled. Thus, the significant resistance mechanisms impairing response to PD-1-targeted agents in NSCLC and other diverse solid tumors have remained intractable to both biomarker discovery and accompanying mechanistic definition.  Project 2 of this U54 application thus directly addresses the pressing issue of intrinsic and acquired resistance to PD-1-targeted immunotherapy in NSCLC through analysis of an invaluable cohort of on-treatment longitudinal biopsies. Aim 1 pursues deep single-cell RNA-seq profiling of the immune component of NSCLC anti-PD-1 on-treatment biopsies using a highly efficient, microfluidic bead-based protocol allowing unsupervised discovery of cell clusters, T cell activation or exhaustion states and transcriptomic insights into immunotherapy resistance. Aim 2 exploits our 3D Patient-Derived Tumor Organoid (PDO) cultures that represent the first in vitro functional recapitulation of the PD-1-dependent immune checkpoint and tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) within clinical NSCLC biopsies. Here, we create functional organoid culture models of NSCLC immunotherapy resistance from longitudinal biopsies, measuring TIL activation upon in vitro anti-PD-1 organoid treatment and correlating against patient response. Lastly, Aim 3 performs prospective liquid biopsy and exome sequencing to determine mutational signatures of anti-PD-1 resistance that functionally regulate immune checkpoints. These Aims utilize synergistic expertise from the Stanford site of the U54 with Calvin Kuo (Project 2 PI; organoid culture, single cell RNA-seq), Ron Levy (tumor immunotherapy) and Heather Wakelee and Suki Padda (NSCLC immunotherapy trials), all in close coordination with Project 1 clinical biopsies, liquid biopsies and whole exome sequencing from Trever Bivona and Sourav Bandyopadhyay of the UCSF site. Overall, we present a comprehensive approach to intrinsic and acquired resistance to PD-1 inhibition in NSCLC via complementary single cell, organoid and sequencing analysis of longitudinal on-treatment biopsies."

Cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) is evidence- based and has been shown to be efficacious in populations with a variety of comorbid conditions including OA-related chronic pain. However, in-person CBT interventions are unlikely to be widely deployable in healthcare systems. Telephone delivery has the advantage of giving patients access to personalized, efficacious CBT-I interventions from home, increasing generalizability, and outreach to minority, rural, and other underserved populations. Previous small trials of telephone CBT-I have reported positive insomnia outcomes, but no large randomized trials have assessed its long-term efficacy, impact on related outcomes in a primary care patient population, or cost-effectiveness. This proposal builds upon our successful completion of two randomized trials of CBT for insomnia with older adults: Lifestyles, a trial of group CBT in older adults with OA-related insomnia and pain, and MsFLASH04, a trial of telephone CBT-I for insomnia in menopausal women with comorbid vasomotor symptoms. Older (60+ yrs) primary care patients across Washington State will be screened for severe persistent OA-related insomnia and pain. Two hundred and seventy patients will be randomized to either CBT-I or an education only attention control (EOC). Each treatment will consist of six 20-30 minute telephone-based sessions over an eight week period. Pre-treatment, post-treatment (2 months), and 9 and 18 month assessments will include measures of sleep, pain, fatigue, mood, and quality of life. A cost effectiveness evaluation of the intervention will also be conducted. We hypothesize: 1) CBT-I will produce significantly greater initial and long-term improvements in sleep outcomes relative to EOC; 2) CBT-I will produce significantly greater initial and long-term improvements in pain, fatigue and mood relative to EOC; and 3) CBT-I will produce long-term reductions in health care utilization and costs relative to EOC. We will also explore whether changes in insomnia severity explain observed effects of CBT-I on secondary outcomes (mediator analysis), and whether CBT-I effects on insomnia differ by baseline insomnia, pain, or depression symptom severity (moderator analysis). The proposed research will determine if telephone CBT-I improves OA insomnia and associated outcomes in a state-wide primary care population of older adults, and inform policy decisions about widespread dissemination of telephone CBT-I in this and related patient populations."

"9384640","The goal of this proposal is to capture the progression of events and responses to these events in the everyday life of middle-aged and older individuals. The Health and Retirement Study (HRS) has provided major insights into the lives of middle-aged and older individuals based on interviews every two years. The proposed study aims to advance further understanding through the use of intensive data collection and an innovative design that allows very detailed and comprehensive data collection proximal to events hypothesized to impact health and wellbeing, including but not limited to retirement. First, we plan to administer the core HRS instrument every two years in the Understanding America Study (UAS, a probability-based Internet panel), so that we have direct comparability with the HRS. Second, we will monitor important events in the lives of older UAS respondents with brief, monthly assessments via the Internet, which will include anticipated events (e.g. retirement, job change, change in marital status) and unanticipated events (e.g. deaths, illnesses, job change); these assessments will signal an immediate intensive ?burst? of data collection in order to better link changes in life circumstances, health, behaviors, and well-being. Third, the intensive assessments will track multiple domains of variables on a daily basis over an entire week, including daily pain, fatigue, physical functioning, stress, wellbeing, exercise, diet, social interaction, sleep, and cognitive function. Fourth, the event- based burst measurements will be embedded in the context of regular, annual intensive measurement bursts, which serve as baselines for evaluating the impact of events. Fifth, we plan to conduct experiments within the intensive assessments of the feasibility and utility of wearable sensors, some of which may be adopted for permanent use in the study design. Overall, the goal is to provide a much richer picture of people's daily lives both before and after retirement and other life events that will enable the study of pathways to many outcomes, such as financial and subjective wellbeing, health, cognitive functioning, and social engagement. We expect these data to be a valuable resource for the research community as it moves to more internet interviewing and use of novel measurement devices."

"9555305","Project Summary ApoE (apolipoprotein E) is an essential component of lipoprotein particles. Three human APOE isoforms exist: E2, E3, and E4. Compared to E3, E2 is protective with regard to susceptibility to develop Alzheimer's disease (AD), is more prevalent among centenarians, and is associated with improved episodic memory performance, larger hippocampal volume, and reduced hippocampal atrophy rate. Little is known, however, about the mechanisms involved in the neuroprotection of E2 in aging, including slowing AD progression. In this proposal, we will use targeted replacement mice and an unbiased epigenomics approach to identify pathway changes that underlie the protective role of E2. The mouse strains to be used include human ApoE and AD genotypes. We have mouse strains expressing human E2 E3, and E4 under the mouse apoE promoter (apoE TR mice). These strains will be crossed with human APP knock in mice developed by Dr. Takaomi Saido (Riken Research Brain Institute) that contain the Swedish and Iberian mutations (APP NL-F) or contain these mutations in combination with the Artic mutation (APP NL-G-F). APP NL-G-F mice accumulate neuropathology and show cognitive impairments one year earlier than the APP NL-F mice (6 versus 18 months). This difference in disease onset will allow us to examine the interaction between neuropathological and aging processes and the E2 isoform. We hypothesize that E2 slows the development of cognitive injury and AD pathology because it enhances neuroprotective and aging protective pathways. To test this hypothesis, three Specific Aims are proposed. The first Aim will examine the protective effect of the E2 isoform, relative to E3 and E4, with regard to early onset histopathological and behavioral and cognitive changes in the NL-G-F mouse strain. We expect to observe less change in the E2 background. Aim 2 will resemble Aim 1, with the exception of crossing the ApoE mice with the slower acting APP NL-F gene. Again, we expect protection from the AD phenotype in the E2 background, which may be relatively greater than in Aim 1 if aging processes are also slowed in the E2 background. Because the association of E2 with reduced AD risk is seen in men but not women, we will examine male and female mice in Aims 1 and 2. For Aim 3, we will use omics approaches to examine DNA methylation (both methylcytosine and hydroxymethylcytosine) and RNA expression profiles in the different strain backgrounds to identify neuroprotective and aging protective pathways that are enhanced in the E2 mice and help explain the protective effect that is conferred by this isoform. Overall, we expect that the work and analyses proposed in this application to identify disease-related pathways that change more slowly and neuroprotective pathways that will be more pronounced in the E2 background, facilitating the identification of diagnostic markers and the development of novel therapeutic targets for AD and other age-related cognitive disorders."
"9350815","ABSTRACT Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is one of the most prevalent and devastating healthcare-associated infections. Following standard antibiotic therapy, up to 25% of individuals with CDI develop one or more recurrences. Persistent or repeated episodes are difficult to treat and are a significant hardship for patients. The high success rate of fecal microbiota transplant for recurrent CDI provides powerful insight into the importance of restoring normal gut microbiota. However, to date, there are no microbiological or ?omic? (microbiomic, metagenomic, metabolomic) predictors of C. difficile recurrence. The objective of this proposal is to determine temporal dynamics of microbial profiles and ?omic? signatures associated with C. difficile recurrence. Our hypothesis is that patients who do not develop a C. difficile recurrence share an identifiable set of microbes, genes, and fecal metabolites in the gut microbiota. The rationale is that once the temporal dynamics of microbial and ?omic? signatures associated with C. difficile recurrence are well defined, candidate microbial or ?omic? biomarkers can be validated prospectively, ultimately allowing the development of strategies to prevent recurrent CDI. Specific preemptive therapy (e.g. microbiome manipulation) may then be developed on the basis of microbial compositions, genes, or metabolites of that microbiota. This novel approach offers an innovative method for preventing recurrent CDI. We will test the hypothesis by pursuing the following Specific Aims: 1) Determine the composition and structure of gut microbiota longitudinally in subjects following CDI, 2) Determine the metagenome of C. difficile gut microbiota, and 3) Perform global metabolomic analyses using LC-HRMS and GC-MS, including cholesterol and bile acid metabolites, to determine key metabolites in C. difficile gut microbiota. The approach is innovative because it will utilize a combination of unbiased, culture-independent 16S rRNA deep sequencing, metagenomic, and metabolomic approach and innovative computational techniques and multivariate statistical methods to identify ?omic? signatures in gut microbiota associated with C. difficile recurrence. The proposed research is significant because there are virtually no data on the relationship between gut microbiota, omic signatures and C. difficile recurrence. This proposal will define ?omic? signatures that can be validated in future studies, ultimately leading to novel strategies based on ?omic? profiles for primary prevention of recurrent CDI."
"9378059","Project Summary Low birth weight (LBW) is an important risk factor for hypertension, cardiovascular and kidney disease; however, the mechanisms by which an adverse fetal environment programs risk for adult disease are poorly understood. Because this risk factor is determined at the beginning of a person?s lifespan, a better understanding of developmental programming can provide insight that improves early disease prevention and intervention to drastically reduce the burden of disease in later adulthood. Novel findings in this area also have great potential to reduce health disparities, as African-Americans are disproportionately affected by LBW and other conditions linked to this risk factor including hypertension and chronic kidney disease. Placental insufficiency is the most common cause of LBW in the Western world, and the reduced uterine perfusion pressure (RUPP) animal model of preeclampsia mimics the same health effects seen in human offspring, including the sex differences in how programming influences cardio-renal disease. Evidence suggests that renal inflammation plays a mediatorial role in the link between hypertension and kidney damage. The objective of this project is to study the effects of chronic elevations in blood pressure on renal health in intrauterine growth restricted (IUGR) offspring, and to elucidate the mechanisms by which changes during development lead to increased renal risk in later life in a sex-specific manner. This will be done by inducing a secondary insult of reduced renal mass by uni-nephrectomy in 18 month old IUGR offspring, and comparing physiological indicators of renal function as well as molecular and histological markers of tissue injury between control and IUGR males and females. Blood pressure-lowering and anti-inflammatory medications will also be used to determine whether early intervention can prevent this renal damage in response to an insult. Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that intrauterine growth restriction programs a long-term increase in blood pressure in males that initiates a progressive accelerated age-related decline in renal function leading to an enhanced susceptibility to renal injury in growth-restricted rats. Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that intrauterine growth restriction programs enhanced up-regulation of renal TNF-? and TGF-?1 in response to a secondary renal insult that contributes to enhanced susceptibility to renal injury in growth-restricted rats."
"9454739","ABSTRACT  Achieving health equity among demographic groups is a crucial policy aim. Despite this policy focus, substantial gaps in health outcomes between black and white Americans remain, and black men consistently rank lowest on a broad array of health outcomes. A growing body of qualitative literature, as well as anecdotal evidence, suggests that mistrust of healthcare institutions explains some of this inequity. Still, both theoretical and empirical research on the causal role of medical mistrust in health disparities remains thin.  We propose to partially fill this gap in the literature using the Tuskegee Study of Untreated Syphilis as a case study. The proposed research will be the first to estimate the impact of the Tuskegee study disclosure in 1972 on the behavior and subsequent health outcomes of black men. Because we observe outcomes and behaviors both before and after the 1972 disclosure, we can quantify the effect in a quasi-experimental context. The timing of the Tuskegee disclosure coincides with the advent of a period of rising mortality inequality for black men relative to their white peers. This divergence, which we date to the mid-1970s, reversed patterns of convergence apparent throughout the 1960s. The role of historic deceptions in the evolution of these disadvantages for black men, along with possible mitigating factors, are understudied but crucially important areas of research that affect disadvantaged populations around the globe.  This project has two specific aims: (1) To estimate the impact of the Tuskegee study disclosure on racial disparities in health-seeking behavior (as reflected in care avoidance and/or delay) and in mortality using predictions derived from economic decision theory. To achieve Aim 1, we have developed a theoretical basis for the evolution of medical mistrust and medical service uptake to inform the proposed empirical methodology. In addition, we propose (2) To evaluate whether the effects of the Tuskegee disclosure on health behaviors and outcomes were mitigated by the availability of minority providers, previous experience with the medical system, or socioeconomic status.  The proposed study has several advantages. First, documenting the temporal profile of racial health disparities among men is a substantial contribution to a thin literature on health outcomes in the years immediately following the passage of the Civil Rights Act and the implementation of Medicare and Medicaid Acts in the United States. Second, medical mistrust is difficult (and unethical) to randomize in an experimental setting, and the Tuskegee event provides a ?natural experiment? which is race-specific and has a sharp disclosure date, facilitating comparisons of behavior before and after 1972. The timing of the event also allows us to measure longer-run outcomes for those exposed to information about the event. Third, an exploration of effective strategies to reduce the impact of mistrust on health disparities provides policy-relevant lessons that can aid in furthering the aim of health equity today."
"9431323","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Spatiotemporal models for periodontal disease monitoring and recall frequencies Tooth loss from periodontal disease (PD) remains a major public health burden in the US. With the rising cost of dental insurance premiums, future professional dental treatment plans will seek to prioritize patients based on their risk of disease and spend more resources monitoring and treating high-risk patients. Hence, there is a need to develop appropriate statistical models and tools for efficient risk assessment of PD, short-term prognosis, and periodontal recall intervals leading to cost-effectiveness of dental treatment plans. Dental datasets present many interesting statistical challenges (non-stationarity, non-normality, spatial dependence, non-random missingness, confounding by indication, huge cluster size, etc), which severely limit the potential of currently-available software (such as Patterson's EagleSoft(r), etc) loaded into the chair- side computer of a periodontist. Currently available statistical software might handle some, but not all of these challenges within a unified paradigm. Goals: The proposed study will develop statistical tools to (a) characterize risk factors for PD progression, (b) rapidly and efficiently indentify changes in a patient's PD status, (c) use short-term predictions to guide periodontal recall decisions, and (d) develop user-friendly software to implement these methods. Subjects: The statistical methods will be developed using a rich 8-year longitudinal database from the HealthPartners HMO, consisting of about 15,000 patients with follow-ups. Available data and study design: A clustered- longitudinal (CL) study design comprises the databases that recorded data for age, gender, race, complete restorative and periodontal records with follow-up, smoking status, diabetes status, oral hygiene, and other essential parameters. Significance: The potential translation to dental clinical practice for this project is strong because it will provide dental practitioners with evidence-based criteria to guid 'personalized' periodontal recalls and treatment decisions. The impact generated is expected to be far- reaching, and the long-term goal would incorporate these new methods into existing chair-side dental software leading to development of cost-effective treatment dental plans with prudent expectations."
"9328470","Project Summary Cardiovascular disease is the primary cause of death for patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). Arrhythmia and cardiac fibrosis leading to dilated cardiomyopathy are the primary mechanisms of cardiac mortality. Pannexins (Pxs), which are large conductance ion and small molecule channels, have been implicated in other fibroproliferative diseases and are thought to be arrhythmogenic in other model of cardiac disease. Loss of dystrophin, the primary defect in DMD, leads to elevated intracellular calcium (Ca2+) which is also a primary effector of Pxs. The goal of this project is to investigate the role of Pxs in the development of cardiac fibrosis and arrhythmogenesis in mdx transgenic mouse model of DMD (Aim 1) human DMD induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) cardiomyocytes (Aim 2). Aim 1A is to identify if Px current contributes to arrhythmogenesis via transient inward current (Iti) and delayed after depolarizations (DADs) in mdx mice using patch clamp electrophysiology, pharmacological blockade, and mdxPx1-/- and mdxPx1-/-Px2-/- transgenic lines. The primary end points will be single channel conductance, average open probability, reversal potential and total current integral. Aim 1B is to test if Px channels facilitate triggered propagated electrical activity and cardiac fibrosis in intact mdx and transgenic hearts using telemetric, molecular techniques (RT-PCR/Western Blot), and histologic evaluation. The primary end points will be rate of premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) and ventricular tachycardia (VT), gross/histologic burden of fibrosis, and relative expression of ATP and other fibrotic mediators. Aim 2A is to test if Px channels contribute to arrhythmogenesis via Iti and DADs in human DMD iPSC cardiomyocytes using patch clamp electrophysiology and pharmacological blockade. The primary end points will be single channel conductance, average open probability, reversal potential and total current integral. Aim 2B is to identify the mechanism of Px channels in modulating mediators of cardiac fibrosis in DMD iPSC cardiomyocytes using transwell co-culture with fibroblasts, pharmacological blockade, and molecular techniques (RT-PCR/Western Blot). The primary end points will be cell migration index and relative expression of ATP and other fibrotic mediators. Cumulatively, this investigation will help to determine what role Pxs play in the development of cardiac fibrosis and pro-arrhythmic electrophysiological changes in DMD. Pxs may represent a novel therapeutic target for delaying or preventing cardiac fibrosis and arrhythmia in patients with DMD."

"9255865","Summary  Macular edema (ME) and diabetic macular edema (DME), which affects at least 2 million people in the  US, are leading causes of blindness in people between the ages of 20-74. The major problem in these  diseases is a leaky vasculature, which results in pooling of blood around the retina. This blood can cause  occlusion of vision as well as swelling and increased ocular pressure and detachment of the retina.  The effective therapies approved to date for these conditions are proteins that are injected intravitreally to bind to VEGF to blocks its activity. Although these drugs are efficacious for some, a significant number of ME patients are unable to gain significant improvements to visual acuity using these drugs. In addition, drugs in this space have also proven to be effective for NVAMD, a $4.5 billion/year market. Our peptide drug AXT107 inhibits signaling of not only VEGF but also of growth factors PDGF, HGF, and IGF-1. Thus, it could serve as an anti-VEGF monotherapy in patients in whom VEGF is the primary driver of disease but it could also successfully treat patients in whom these other factors contribute to disease. AXT107 could also have advantages over the next generation combination therapy of Fovista, an anti-PDGF aptamer, with Eylea or Lucentis. Specifically because AXT107 inhibits PDGF and VEGF simultaneously, even as a monotherapy it could be as efficacious as the combination while avoiding the dual injection and the associated complications.  AsclepiX Therapeutics LLC represents the next generation of drug development technology. We use bioinformatics and systems biology methods to design classes of short biomimetic anti-angiogenic and anti- permeability peptides. In addition, we also have technology to prolong the efficacy of our peptide agents through long-lasting biodegradable nano- and microparticles as may be needed. Although he have demonstrated efficacy of our novel lead agent, including in gold standard head-to-head models in the mouse and rabbit vs. the leading FDA-approved agents, we have not yet conducted the IND enabling GLP toxicity studies needed in two species to enable the filing of an IND for subsequent FDA approval. This Phase II SBIR Proposal would provide the funding necessary to move this technology from promising pre-clinical research to a patient?s bedside and the beginning of clinical trials.  This proposal is to optimize the excipients and formulation for our novel biomimetic peptide drug, determine its local toxicity and biodistribution when administered intravitreally, and determine its potential toxicity when administered at various doses systemically.  We believe that our Phase II program will lead to the approval of an IND for a novel safe and effective peptide agent for treating macular edema. This drug has the potential to improve the vision of millions of Americans and may be impactful in multiple ocular diseases."
"9403831","We have shown that loss of somatostatin (SST) expression in the hypothalamus is associated with chronic excitatory activation of brainstem sympathetic autonomic effector neurons in diabetes. We have evidence that periventricular hypothalamic SST neurons (i.e. those that innervate brainstem sympathetics) directly innervate bone marrow (BM) and that preservation of this small, but important population appears to be particularly relevant to prevent sympathetic hyperactivity. Sympathetic hyperactivity leads to BM dysfunction with an increase in the generation and release of proinflammatory monocytes that contribute to the development of diabetic retinopathy (DR). Systemic monocytosis resulting from BM dysfunction also serves to promote neuroinflammation of the hypothalamus and of brainstem sympathetic autonomic effector neurons resulting in an auto-perpetuating cycle of excitation of autonomic neurons.  The central hypothesis emerging from these studies is that restoring SST levels and neuronal activity in the diabetic hypothalamus to nondiabetic levels will reduce chronic excitatory activation of brainstem sympathetic autonomic effector neurons, avoid development of BM pathology and the subsequent systemic and retinal inflammation leading to DR.  In Aim 1, we will determine whether loss of SST neuronal activity results in persistent hypothalamic hyper excitation of brainstem autonomic effector nuclei and chronic over activation of the BM leading to BM pathology. In Aim 2, we will determine whether restoration of SST levels using vector expressing SST in hypothalamic neurons of diabetic rodents will reduce chronic over activation of sympathetic neuronal activity to the BM, prevent/reverse BM dysfunction and prevent/treat DR. In Aim 3, we will test whether long-term pharmacological supplementation using intranasal delivery of the somatostatin analogue, octreotide, would prevent diabetes-induced BM dysfunction and DR, and block hypothalamic inflammation to stop the auto-perpetuating cycle of excitation of autonomic neurons. SST analogues have been tested extensively in humans and this strategy could be immediately translated to clinical use by adopting intranasal administration of SST analogues to reduce diabetes-induced sympathetic hyperactivity responsible for BM pathology, systemic inflammation and DR."
"9349493","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a severe, rapid-onset disease characterized by a rapid loss in renal function leading to substantial morbidity and mortality. Frequent causes of AKI include ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury and acute drug or toxicant exposure. Despite attempts to develop new therapeutic strategies to treat AKI, few have been successful, and mortality has remained unchanged for several decades. Therefore, novel targets must be examined for the development of useful therapies for AKI. It has been shown that renal proximal tubule cells exhibit severe mitochondrial dysfunction and depletion of mitochondrial proteins following toxicant exposure or I/R injury. Mitochondrial dysfunction leads to oxidative stress and persistent energy depletion, which exacerbates injury and impairs energy-dependent repair, leading to end organ damage and failure in a variety of tissues. Our laboratory has demonstrated that injured renal proximal tubules can recover if they are induced to generate new mitochondria through mitochondrial biogenesis (MB). In addition, our laboratory has identified several compounds capable of inducing MB in vitro and in in vivo models of AKI. Among these compounds are several b2 adrenergic receptor (b2AR) agonists; however, not all b2AR agonists were found to induce MB. The capacity of these compounds to induce MB biogenesis did not correlate with affinity, but did correlate with the capacity of these compounds to increase levels of cGMP. In turn, cGMP has been shown to induce MB by increasing the activity of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator-1a (PGC1a), the master regulator of MB. We hypothesize that biogenic b2AR agonists stimulate MB and promote recovery of renal function by inducing a specific receptor conformation that leads to the production of cGMP. This hypothesis will be addressed through the following Specific Aims. Aim 1 will determine the effects of mitochondrial biogenic agonists-induced effects on the b2AR that lead to a biogenic conformation. Site-directed mutagenesis and immunoblot analysis will identify b2AR phosphorylation sites required for the induction of MB. Aim 2 will elucidate the role of Gas- and Gai-dependent signaling pathways in the generation of cGMP and the induction of MB. Pharmacologic inhibitors and siRNA will identify the relevant signaling pathways for the induction of MB. Non-MB b2AR agonists will be used as controls. Aim 3 will determine the b2AR signaling pathways found in Aims 1 and 2 in the recovery of renal function following I/R injury using b2AR KO mice and pharmacological inhibitors. These results will further support the approach of using drugs that induce MB to accelerate recovery of renal function after AKI."
"9385673","Abstract  The MARBLES (Markers of Autism Risk in Babies: Learning Early Signs) Study was launched in 2006 by the UC Davis MIND Institute and Center for Children's Environmental Health as the first epidemiologic cohort of younger siblings of children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) to begin follow-up during (and before) the prenatal period when ASD and other neurodevelopmental outcomes are likely to originate.1-7 In contrast to population-based cohorts, which require very large sample sizes given a relatively low prevalence of ASD (currently 1 in 68)8 and typically are not able to conduct gold standard diagnosis of ASD, the enriched risk design takes advantage of participants at exceptionally high risk for developing ASD and other neurodevelopmental outcomes, achieving tremendous efficiencies. Previous cohorts of high-risk younger siblings recruited postnatally have not addressed non-inherited and potentially modifiable etiologic factors.9 Early enrollment provides an opportunity to examine a broad array of environmental exposures and their mechanisms, while simultaneously allowing thorough search for early biologic markers.10  Given increasing prevalence of ASD,8,11 it is more critical now than ever to invest in studies identifying emerging environmental factors responsible for increasing risk of these neurodevelopmental disorders and the mechanisms underlying their etiology, which are currently not well-understood. This project addresses both gaps by maintaining and enhancing the resource infrastructure of the MARBLES enriched-risk cohort. Retention of this cohort with deep evaluation of risk factors, mechanistic markers, and outcomes will be critical to evaluation and early identification of newly emerging etiologic factors for ASD in a susceptible population, serving as a canary in a coal-mine for identifying exposures that influence neurodevelopment. Our cohort's data and specimens will permit analyses of new questions on exposures in relation to well-defined clinical neurodevelopmental outcomes, and our rich characterization of mechanistic biomarkers could identify pathways and signatures of susceptibility involved. We propose to continue to enroll and follow-up participants of one of the only enriched-risk ASD U.S. cohorts with prospectively collected pregnancy data and biosamples that is currently in no cost extension (NCE). In addition, we propose to further develop and maintain our repository infrastructure for the expansive data and sample repositories in order to expand collaborative sharing and facilitate investigation of newly-emerging environmental exposures and molecular mechanistic markers in relation to risk and presentation of ASD and other adverse neurodevelopmental conditions. Finally, we plan to validate and reliability test environmental exposure questions and measures for use in future studies. Completion of these aims will assist collaborative sharing of our vast collection of data and biosamples to facilitate investigation of newly-emerging environmental exposures and molecular mechanistic markers in relation to risk and presentation of ASD and other adverse neurodevelopmental conditions."
"9549196","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed research combines modeling at molecular, cellular and network scales to address the mechanisms underlying a fundamental behavioral state: attention. Voluntary attention is essential for sensory- guided behavior and memory formation. The neurotransmitter Acetylcholine (ACh) is considered an important contributor to attentional modulation in the cortex. This project aims to understand how the spatio- temporally diffuse ACh system in the cortex achieves spatial and temporal specificity demanded by behavioral tasks such as attention. The studies outlined in this research will broadly aim to test the hypothesis that the cholinergic system achieves the required spatio-temporal precision by coordinating the expression and localization of its molecular components (enzymes, receptors, transporters) rather than the 'classical' approach of precise wiring with fast synaptic transmission. The mentored phase will involve examining how the anatomical organization of the cholinergic system in the cortex shapes the spatio-temporal profile of its transmission. Current models of cholinergic transmission have been implicitly guided by the knowledge of ACh machinery, especially that of enzymatic action, at the neuromuscular junction. Molecular-level models of reaction-diffusion systems will be used to test how the available enzymes in the cortical extracellular space shape the temporal profile of ACh released from non-synaptic sites. The project will aim to generate predictions for the spatial organization of the cholinergic system in the cortical ultra-structure. Inspired by previous work by the candidate, the computational principles guiding the modulatory role of sub-cellular domains of ACh receptors will be investigated in the independent phase. The candidate will use biophysical models of dendrites, ion channels and neurotransmitter receptors for these investigations. The progress made in the mentored and early independent phase will lead to investigation of the mechanisms of cholinergic modulation of network dynamics. Detailed biophysical and phenomenological network models will be used to explore the hypothesis that the known cell-type specificity and sub-cellular patterns of AChR expression in the primary visual cortex underlie the attention-modulation of network oscillations. To achieve these aims the candidate needs further training, specifically in advanced molecular modeling techniques and theoretical foundations of visual and molecular neurobiology. The mentoring lab and the present institute is the ideal training environment for the achievement of these goals. The candidate's mentor is one of the world's pioneers in the computational investigation of neurobiology. The neurobiology division at the institute has a strong focus on vision research. The candidate's main collaborator is one of the leading experts in the cholinergic system in the visual cortex. After a short period n this exciting environment, the candidate expects to be ready to embark upon an independent research career and will seek a tenure-track position in Neuroscience."
"9455155","Abstract Peripheral neuropathic pain is a major health problem in the U.S. because of its high prevalence and poor response to currently available therapies. Although the pain has many pathological causes and anatomical locations, and its presentation in patients can vary considerably, fundamentally, its positive symptoms include just two distinct features: spontaneous pain and stimulus-evoked pain. Spontaneous pain arises as a consequence of ectopic activity in axons in the injured nerve?action potentials arising spontaneously from hyperexcitable membranes. Surprisingly, it is not at all clear what the exact source of this activity is?whether it originates in injured neurons or in neighboring intact ones, in A- or C-fibers, and in nociceptors or non- nociceptors. Furthermore, although there are changes in ion channel expression after peripheral axonal injury, the molecular mechanisms responsible for ectopic activity are still uncertain. It is also not known whether there are different mechanisms in different sensory neuron subtypes and whether these change over time. The goal of this grant is to precisely elucidate the cellular source and molecular mechanisms of spontaneous somatic pain after sciatic nerve injury in mice using live imaging in vivo, single cell Next Generation profiling by Nuc-seq and by Patch-seq - single cell profiling of electrophysiologically characterized pre-injured and intact neurons in vitro, and by measuring spontaneous changes in behavior in freely moving animals in an automated observer independent way. Finally, the project will also evaluate whether silencing specific subsets of sensory neurons using genetic tools that block synaptic input into the CNS has an effect on spontaneous pain-related behaviors. These experiments will provide data on the timing, extent and pattern of spontaneous activity after nerve injury, and in which sensory neurons. They will also identify those transcriptional changes specific to the presence of spontaneous activity at a single cell level. This mechanistic understanding will lay a foundation for identifying novel therapeutic opportunities for treating spontaneous neuropathic pain."
"9373541","Project Description/Summary Gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) is a rare type of cancer that affects approximately 40,000 patients with an annual incidence of 5,000 cases in the US. It arises from the ?pacemaker? cells of the gastrointestinal tract and is mainly characterized by activating mutations in KIT or PDGFRA receptor tyrosine kinases. Despite the initial clinical success of imatinib that targets mutant KIT/PDGFRA, nearly all advanced GIST patients develop imatinib-resistance and eventually die of their disease. It is critical to gain a better understanding of the pathogenesis of GIST and to develop novel treatment strategies that are 1) more effective than first-line imatinib therapy and 2) can delay and/or prevent imatinib-resistance. ETV1, an ETS family transcription factor and a well-established oncogene in prostate cancer and melanoma, has recently been discovered to play a critical role in GIST oncogenesis. ETV1 is highly expressed and is required for growth and survival of GISTs. ETV1 is a master regulator of the ICC-GIST lineage and is required for GIST tumor initiation and maintenance in vivo. ETV1 and mutant KIT form a positive feedback circuit in GIST oncogenesis, where the ETV1 protein is stabilized by active MAP kinase signaling downstream of KIT signaling and stabilized ETV1 in turn upregulates KIT expression. Hence, ETV1 represents a novel drug target. We demonstrated that the combination of MEK162 and imatinib can durably inhibit ETV1 protein and lead to enhanced apoptosis in GIST cells and complete responses of GIST tumors. These preclinical data led to an investigator initiated ?phase Ib/II study of MEK162 in combination with imatinib in patients with untreated advanced GIST? to directly evaluate the safety and clinical efficacy of this novel combination therapy in advanced GIST. The phase Ib portion of the study has been completed and has demonstrated the safety and defined the recommended phase II doses of the combination therapy in GIST patients. The phase II study is currently accruing and forms the basis of this proposal. The primary goal of the phase II study is to evaluate the efficacy of the combination of MEK162 and imatinib by RECIST responses in untreated advanced GIST patients. The phase II trial included secondary endpoints that evaluate the progression free survival, overall survival and respectability rate. There are mandatory pre- and post-treatment biopsies and biopsies at disease progression for correlative studies that explore the effect of the combination therapy in ETV1 target inhibition: a) inhibition of the ETV1 protein level, and 2) inhibition of the ETV1-dependent transcriptome. Additionally, we will examine the genetic tumor heterogeneity and genetic basis of resistance mechanisms to the combination therapy from the plasma tumor-derived cell-free DNA and clinical samples obtained at disease progression. We believe that targeting ETV1 by the combination treatment strategy represents a novel approach in GIST therapeutics. The phase II clinical trial, if successful, has the potential to revolutionize the first line therapy of GIST treatment and change the landscape of clinical practice in GIST management."

"9442582","The Data Science Core, based at Stanford University, is the component through which the overall management and sharing of experimental and simulation data will be conducted. The Data Science Core will implement the Data Science Plan by developing an integrated software framework for data storage, analysis, and simulation, and by closely collaborating with all team members to ensure that their research needs are met in a timely manner. This effort will require a full-time data scientist that will be responsible for implementing and overseeing the data management framework and ensuring its effective use among team members. The data management framework, detailed in the data science plan, is based on a common description and storage format for experimental datasets produced by the proposed experiments in Projects 1-4, and will include adapted versions of the existing analysis software or new analysis tools that support the common format, software tools to efficiently extract and represent cellular and network properties from experimental time series, and a pipeline to use data stored in these formats to constrain our large-scale neuronal network models in Project 5. The principal data scientist will be responsible for collaboration with external organizations that develop scientific data formats, such as Neurodata Without Borders and the HDF Group, in order to ensure that best technical practices are followed in development of the storage format and support software, and for effective dissemination to the broader scientific community of all software and data generated by the projects via a resource such as Collaborative Research in Computational Neuroscience (CRCNS). The Data Science Core will play an important part in achieving the overall goals of the research projects by ensuring consistent use of analysis methods, facilitating data sharing among team members, allowing direct comparison of the outcomes of experiments performed in different labs under different conditions, and will accelerate the development of open-source software tools to help increase reproducibility across research teams."
"9463254","Project Summary  Coronary microvascular disease (CMD) is increasingly recognized as a major contributor to heart failure in patients with obesity and diabetes. Recent studies have shown that, in the absence of obstructive epicardial coronary artery disease (CAD), impaired myocardial perfusion reserve (MPR) assessed by PET or MRI is a functional consequence of CMD and predicts a high risk of adverse cardiac events. Presently, unlike for CAD, there is no established treatment for CMD. Mechanistically, obesity and diabetes cause activation of the renin- angiotensin-aldosterone system and, in addition to angiotensin II, basic research demonstrates a central role of aldosterone and the corresponding mineralocorticoid receptor in vascular oxidative stress and inflammation, resulting in endothelial dysfunction, impaired vascular smooth muscle function and vasodilation, and perivascular fibrosis in excised isolated arterioles. Translating these findings, initial clinical imaging studies demonstrate that mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs) improve impaired MPR in overweight/obese and diabetic patients without CAD. While promising, the specific mechanism of action underlying the therapeutic effects of MRAs in improving MPR is not fully understood, data suggest that MRAs may be ineffective in women, and there are conflicting data regarding whether the therapeutic effects extend to microvascular dysfunction in peripheral artery disease. We have developed reproducible quantitative perfusion MRI methods for mice and established mice fed a high-fat diet (HFD) as a model of obesity, type II diabetes, CMD without CAD, and impaired MPR. We also showed that, like in humans, eplerenone (EPL), a selective MRA, improves MPR in male HFD mice. The goals of the present proposal are to develop and use MRI and pharmacologic and genetic manipulations in HFD mice to prove the central roles of the vascular smooth muscle mineralocorticoid receptor and oxidative stress in impaired MPR due to obesity and diabetes, and to shed light on open questions concerning whether MRAs are effective in females and in peripheral microvascular dysfunction."
"9467772","Project Summary Anxiety and depression are highly prevalent neuropsychiatric disorders which cause substantial morbidity and mortality. A top priority of NIMH is to elucidate the molecules, cells, and neural circuits associated with complex behaviors, including anxiety and depression (NIMH Strategic Objective 1.1). The medial habenula (MHb) is a well-conserved epithalamic structure known to be a powerful modulator of fear and escape behavior in zebrafish and anxiety- and depressive-like behaviors in rodents, and has been shown by MRI to be decreased in volume in humans with depression. The output of MHb neurons is impacted by their synaptic inputs, such as from the medial septum and nucleus of the diagonal band (MSDB), which provides the sole identified GABAergic input to the MHb. We have generated preliminary data showing that CB1 receptor activation by endocannabinoids or by a CB1 receptor agonist suppresses GABAergic inputs in the MHb. Guided by these exciting findings, we hypothesized that 2-AG/CB1 signaling increases the output of MHb neurons via suppression of the MSDB input and disinhibition of MHb neurons, resulting in anxiolytic and antidepressant-like behavioral effects. This hypothesis will be tested via two Specific Aims. In Aim I, we will determine if functional CB1 receptors are expressed on MSDB to MHb axon terminals and how their activation affects MHb neuronal output. We will use viral vectors to express ChR2 in the MSDB and selectively activate MSDB axonal terminals that innervate MHb neurons through optogenetic stimulation. We will then examine whether CB1 receptor activation alters light-induced inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) and action potential firing in MHb neurons. In Aim II, we will determine how gain- or loss-of-function in 2-AG/CB1 signaling in the MSDB to MHb circuit affects CB1-mediated suppression of MSDB inputs, and test the hypothesis that this bi-directionally alters anxiety- and depression-like behaviors. Loss-of-function is achieved via targeted deletion of CB1 receptors, while gain-of-function is achieved by targeted deletion of the enzyme that degrades 2-AG, monoacylglycerol lipase. In completing this project, the trainee will master a wide range of powerful experimental techniques, such as ex vivo slice electrophysiology, optogenetics, confocal imaging, in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry, viral microinjection, pharmacology, and animal behavior assays. Further, the proposed research will expand our knowledge of the neural substrates underlying anxiety and depressive disorders, and how they are regulated by eCB signaling."
"9469190","PROJECT SUMMARY The proper distribution of intracellular cargo is crucial for a wide variety of fundamental cellular processes, and defects in intracellular transport are particularly prevalent in neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders. However, how cargo transport is precisely organized such that the correct cargo is transported to the right place at the right time is not well understood. The long-term goals of this project are to understand how cargo transport is organized and executed in the cell, and to identify components that are adversely affected in diseased states. The majority of cargo in the cell is transported on microtubule tracks by the motor proteins dynein and kinesin. In the standard dogma of motor-driven transport, cargos are linked directly to motor proteins by adaptor molecules. The motor protein then transports the specific type of cargo to its destination. In contrast to this straightforward model of transport, the Reck-Peterson lab has recently co-discovered a novel mechanism of organelle transport, termed ?hitchhiking?. Hitchhiking occurs when one type of cargo, rather than attaching directly to a motor, is tethered to and co-transported with another type of cargo. Our lab found that peroxisomes hitchhike on early endosomes in the model organism Aspergillus nidulans and identified the novel linker PxdA as being required for the co-transport of peroxisomes and early endosomes. However, whether hitchhiking is prevalent transport mechanism used to transport other organelle types and how PxdA mediates hitchhiking remain to be determined. This project will investigate the universality and mechanism of organelle hitchhiking in Aspergillus nidulans and hippocampal neurons using a combination of genetics, live cell imaging, and in vitro biochemistry. My aims are to 1) determine whether PxdA acts as a tether between peroxisomes and early endosomes, or whether it has additional functions, 2) determine whether lipid droplets and endoplasmic reticulum also hitchhike on EEs and if they require PxdA to do so, and 3) investigate whether organelle hitchhiking is conserved in hippocampal neurons and identify the linkers required for organelle hitchhiking in these cells. Together, my work will enhance our understanding of how hitchhiking works at a mechanistic level as well as its prevalence as a form of organelle transport."
"9417486","Project Summary/Abstract In March 2016, the Centers for Disease Control issued a guideline (CDCG) for prescribing opioids for chronic pain in general primary care settings, which was intended to reduce prescription opioid-related harms while maintaining pain control and function. However, due to a paucity of data on the effectiveness of prescription opioid risk mitigation strategies, ambiguity in some of the CDCG recommendations, and the challenging nature of the patient-provider opioid conversation, the success of the CDCG may hinge on the manner in which it is implemented in individual care settings. In this proposal, we have chosen to focus on the HIV primary care setting for which we will develop a tailored, algorithmic ?testable? version of the CDCG (?CDCG intervention?), and then pilot it in a randomized-controlled feasibility study. The development process will involve collaboration with stakeholders. First we will elicit recommendations from 50 HIV-infected individuals using a process of Public Deliberation. Next we will collaborate with an advisory board of HIV healthcare providers to use these recommendations to develop and iteratively refine the CDCG intervention. For the feasibility study, we will randomize and train 10 HIV primary care providers (PCPs) to provide the CDCG intervention or usual care to consenting patients (~5 per PCP) to whom they already prescribe opioids for chronic pain. The intervention will be provided for 6 months during which time patient-participants will be monitored for signs of opioid misuse, and changes in pain control, antiretroviral adherence, and their relationship with their provider. Multiple aspects of feasibility will be examined, including but not limited to: recruitment and randomization of PCPs, maintenance of intervention fidelity for the duration of the study, appropriateness of the control arm, and appropriateness of the outcome measures. The results of the study will be the basis for a future large, randomized controlled trial which will provide evidence for the effectiveness of the CDCG intervention in improving prescription opioid safety in the HIV primary care setting, and will also provide insights into how the CDCG might best be implemented in other settings."
"9278037","SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Core A ? Administration, Research Coordination, and Planning The substantial benefits of the program project grant mechanism are made possible by an administrative core that is actively engaged with the research team as a whole, both in coordinating the ongoing conduct of the individual research projects and in advancing and promoting the underlying themes and objectives of the overall program. The activities of the administrative core encompass organizational and financial management, research support, outreach, substantive integration, dissemination, planning, and research development. One role of the core is to provide centralized administrative, communications, and research support. A second is to stimulate interest in health-related research in the larger community. The core is both the integrative glue for the subprojects that make up the program project and the cornerstone for coordinating, promoting, recruiting and advancing NBER research in health economics more generally. It seeks to engage in program activities many of the best scholars at all levels of experience, from graduate students to post-docs to emerging leaders to prominent scholars. A third role is facilitating collaboration, including organizing working group meetings, workshops, and conferences that bring people together. Promoting interactions between the core research team and health care practitioners is an important additional aim of the administrative core. A fourth activity of the core is the substantive integration of findings from multiple projects. The major themes of program project research weave through most or all of the component projects, creating synergies of cross-project learning. The importance of the findings from each subproject, and how they fit together, requires intellectual attention and additional research focus that is an explicit activity and goal of the core. A fifth responsibility is research dissemination. This is done primarily through articles in peer-reviewed journals, but also through a well- established working paper series, and non-technical newsletters. The core is particularly instrumental in preparing the non-technical summaries that appear in NBER newsletters. Sixth, the core promotes dynamic research planning and development. While this application proposes a research agenda for the next five years, it is a living plan, evolving over time in response to what we learn as we progress, to new opportunities that arise, and to changes in the health, health care and health policy environment in which our research is conducted. The core pays attention to the ongoing relevance of each research plan, and seeks to identify gaps that might be filled through new research development."
"9354440","PROJECT ABSTRACT Nearly 50 million people have surgery each year in the United States, approximately one million develop serious complications, and over 150,000 die within 30 days. Health-care-associated infections (HAIs), the most common complications in surgical patients, place a huge burden on patients, their families, the healthcare system, and society. As there is a clinical and economic imperative to decrease surgical complications, efficient and accurate reporting of HAIs is paramount. Unfortunately, the current model of HAI reporting routinely involves data collection that is inaccurate, burdensome and/or expensive. Achieving accurate and efficient automation of data collection for performance measures, including HAIs, will not only support better local surgical quality improvement, but also will accelerate the transition from process to outcome-based measures suitable for value-based purchasing, new models of physician payment, and public reporting. This proposal attempts to address this challenge by leveraging currently available informatics technologies to automate the data collection from electronic health records for HAIs and other surgical performance measures. We hypothesize that, using advanced informatics methods combined with an iterative process that is informed by multidisciplinary input, data from electronic health records can be mined to develop scientifically valid, cost- effective outcome measures which will compare favorably with those derived from ACS NSQIP data, a clinical registry recognized for its rigorous accuracy. We will test and optimize the algorithms at five unique hospitals in four health systems and two electronic health record vendors to begin to determine the scalability of this approach. The American College of Surgeons (ACS), the primary site, has the content expertise, clinical registry and national influence necessary to drive change in the approach to performance measurement in surgery. We have assembled an accomplished team of national leaders in surgical outcome measurement and data (Clifford Ko, MD, MHS), quality improvement and implementation science (Elizabeth Wick, MD, Peter Pronovost, MD, PhD), informatics (Genevieve Melton, MD, Ph.D., Quintiles), and hospital epidemiology (Trish Perl, MD, MPH). Successful completion this work will impact the field in three main ways: 1) make available a strategy to automate five NQF-endorsed performance measures from the EHR; 2) provide essential knowledge about what is required at the hospital level to automate outcome measurement and the scalability of this approach to multiple hospitals, and; 3) accelerate transition from the use of process to outcome measures for value-based purchasing and physician payment models. The proposed research is novel and timely, and is the next important step on the path to making valid surgical performance measures available to all hospitals and clinicians, and ultimately the public.  "
"9565214","PROJECT SUMMARY The proposed 5-year project will allow us to identify the spectrum of bisphenol contaminants in our environment, gain insight to their metabolism during pregnancy, assess fetal exposure levels, and begin to assess effects of exposure on fetal development through studies of the fetal ovary. During the current project period, we have amassed a unique collection of human pregnancy specimens over a particularly interesting time in the history of bisphenol A (BPA) and other bisphenols. We have also improved analytical methodology for accurate and complete measurement of BPA and its metabolites and begun to extend this methodology to the analysis of emergent bisphenols that are replacing BPA. We propose to complete the development of new analytical tools and obtain data on parent and metabolite levels of replacement bisphenols in maternal (urine and serum) and fetal (cord serum and amniotic fluid) biospecimens from second trimester pregnancies. We will determine if BPA levels have changed with the appearance of new bisphenols, if the total `bisphenol load' is increasing with time in our study population, and assess current human fetal exposure levels. We also will conduct studies of metabolizing enzymes to evaluate maternal and fetal metabolism of bisphenols. Although exploratory in nature, these studies will allow us to test existing hypotheses about the key factors that influence fetal exposure and generate new hypotheses. Taken together, the unique and detailed information on maternal/fetal pairs that will be generated will allow us to analyze the impact of genetic variation on the metabolism of individual contaminants, and assess the effects of exposure on the earliest stages of egg development in the fetal ovary."
"9351050","Project Abstract Antibiotic resistance currently claims 700,000 lives a year. If the current trends continue, antimicrobial-resistant infections are expected to outpace cancer as a cause of death by 2050. Antibiotic resistance is correlated with the overexpression of particular efflux pumps. These efflux pumps shuttle out most classes of antibiotics so that the antibiotics can?t reach their targets. Efflux pumps have also been shown to be a promising target for otherwise antibiotic tolerant biofilms which are responsible for virtually all chronic bacterial infection. My long term goal is to combat antibiotic resistant infection and infections that have formed biofilms by disabling efflux pumps. Disabling efflux pumps would make the antibiotics we already have work like new by stopping them from being removed from the cell and allowing them to reach their targets. Moreover, disabling efflux pumps in biofilms would act as a potent antibiotic which would cause bacteria to die from their own toxins. Prior efforts to disable efflux pumps have focused on inhibiting one of the drug binding sites of the pump; those efforts have yielded compounds that are toxic and overly specific. The objective of this proposal is to design peptides that prevent the oligomerization of the outer membrane component of the efflux pumps. By targeting the oligomerization of the pump?s ?-strands in its ?-barrel, the resulting pharmaceuticals will be less likely to suffer from toxicity and over-specificity than the current alternatives. Our central hypothesis is that we can disrupt assembly of the outer membrane ?-barrel component of efflux pumps by binding their interface strands with ?-stranded peptides similar to the target-strands? native binding partners. Using this hypothesis, we have designed a proof-of-concept peptide that can disable an efflux pump and sensitize bacteria to antibiotics. However, there have never before been proteins designed to bind to outer membrane proteins, and much of the critical information about those protein-protein interactions is unknown. Therefore, in order to effectively apply this protein design methodology to a broad range of pumps and bacteria species we plan to determine the specificity and affinity markers for the outer membrane-bound oligomerization interactions. We then plan to design high-affinity, efflux pump inhibitors that can combat both antibiotic resistant bacteria and bacteria that have formed biofilms. We will measure specificity and affinity of our interactions in vitro through oligomerization and unfolding studies. We will also study affinity and specificity in bacterial cells by assessment of the level of antibiotic potentiation and biofilm remediation. Ultimately, we plan to make our peptides into drugs that will conquer these two major public health crises. This proposal?s innovation is (1) that we are designing a type of protein-protein interaction that has never been designed before and (2) the novel utilization of an outer membrane protein as a potential pharmaceutical target for combating antibiotic resistance and biofilms. Overall, this work is poised to make a significant contribution because it may enable a revival of existing antibiotics against resistant superbugs and provide novel drugs against antibiotic-tolerant biofilms."
"9462507","A major challenge of demyelinating diseases, particularly Multiple Sclerosis (MS), is the progression to a condition of chronic demyelination and incomplete remyelination. The reasons for the incomplete remyelination are not known. Largely disregarded is the fact that the human CNS contains significant amounts of latent viruses, most of which are members of the herpes virus family. Infection with human herpesviruses 6A (HHV6) in humans results in almost all cases in viral latency, a state where the virus does not produce a fully infectious virion. Establishment of latency of HHV6 involves formation of a viral nuclear episome, integration into the human genome and expression of the viral protein U94. In ~1% of the human population this occurs in the germline resulting in a single copy of the viral genome in every nucleated cell (ciHHV) and while it has been reported that ciHHV6 carriers display some mild developmental delays during childhood, the impact of ciHHV6 on the susceptibly or response to demyelination is not known. However, an emerging literature shows strong associations between the presence of HHV6 DNA and MS lesions, and a significant subset of chronic MS patients shows serological responses consistent with latent infections. Moreover, our preliminary data provide evidence for (i) chromosomal integration, latency, and expression of U94 after infection of hOPCs, (ii) impaired migration of U94 expressing OPC in vitro and after transplantation and (iii) molecular changes, like downregulation of intreginV5, in U94 expressing OPCs. No available animal models have exploited the presence of this ?CNS virome? and its potential to impair remyelination in the context of myelin damage. To address this paucity, we focus on the role of latent HHV6, a dominant component of the ?CNS virome?. While the species specificity of HHV6 precludes the generation of animal models via primary viral infection, the expression of the latency-associated viral protein U94 offers the opportunity to model at least some aspects of HHV6 latency in an animal model. We propose to generate an inducible U94 transgenic mouse models that mimics aspects of HHV6 latency and test the hypothesis that expression of the latency associated viral protein U94 in oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) plays a role in the progression of demyelinating disease. The ability to migrate to the site of myelin damage and differentiate into mature myelinating oligodendrocytes is a critical component of the repair process, but the quantitation of impaired de and re-myelination using transplantation approaches are limited. The proposed new animal model will allow us to determine the impact of U94 on myelination during development and the impact on demyelination and remyelination after injury."
"9341803","Project summary This proposal represents an opportunity to directly study in vivo how the intermediary metabolite nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) contributes to the onset of age-related pathologies, due to its limited local availability. NAD+ is critical for cellular metabolism and for prolonging health in old age. Decreased steady- state NAD+ levels have been linked to human pathologies such as neurodegeneration, cardiovascular disease, metabolic syndrome, and cancer. However, NAD+ concentrations are highly compartmentalized by cell type, subcellular localization, and protein-bound or free fractions. Thus, a lack of methods to directly monitor free NAD+ in cells with spatial and temporal information has hindered our learning about the relevant pools, threshold concentrations, and timing that NAD+ may undergo leading to disease onset. This precludes our ability to identify treatments or approaches to intervene before NAD+ levels are misregulated.  To address this roadblock, we have developed a genetically-encodable fluorescent biosensor for free NAD+. Targeting of the sensor to subcellular compartments has revealed compartmentalization of intracellular NAD+ that is differentially coordinated in different cell types. Excitingly, the data also pointed to the existence of a putative mammalian mitochondrial NAD+ transporter. We believe the sensor can address key problems in aging with the hypothesis that misregulation of mitochondrial NAD+ is a major underlying cause of late-onset pathologies. This proposal will use the sensor to identify the proteins required for mitochondria to sustain their elevated concentrations of NAD+ and how this pool may be altered in older neurons. This has important implications for understanding cellular bioenergetics and mitochondrial health, as well as identifying new options to combat neurodegeneration. Understanding how local NAD+ levels fluctuate and may limit the function of NAD+-dependent enzymes is important to evaluate whether NAD+ regulation represents a viable treatment approach or intervention for age-related diseases."

Inyenyeri, a private social entrepreneurship venture, will provide free cookstoves to over 50,000 households in Western Rwanda and implement a fuel pellet business over the next three years. We will build a randomized control trial 1) to assess the impact of this intervention on exposure to carbon monoxide, particulate matter (PM) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) of the primary household cook, and 2) to model the dose-response relationship between exposure and cardiovascular disease risk. We will conduct exposure monitoring and health assessments six times over two years in 180 households, one-third of which we will randomized out to the control arm. We will conduct a socioeconomic survey in a sample of 1,400 households at baseline, 12 and 24 months to measure consumption, health, time use, and emissions exposure to model the impact of cookstove adoption on time allocation, income generating activities, school enrollment and household poverty."
"9397437","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Environmental exposure and endogenous metabolism both give rise to the alkylation of DNA, and DNA alkylation represents the major mechanism of action for a number of commonly prescribed cancer chemotherapeutic agents. Thus, assessing how alkylated DNA lesions compromise the flow of genetic information by altering the efficiency and fidelity of DNA replication and transcription and how these lesions are repaired will provide important knowledge for understanding the implications of DNA alkylation in the etiology for developing human diseases. Such knowledge will also form the basis for developing better strategies for cancer chemotherapy. The emphasis of this application is placed on a group of alkylated thymidine lesions which have been shown to persist in mammalian tissues or have been detected at substantially elevated levels in lymphocyte samples of humans exposed to cigarette smoke. We will employ an innovative and multi- pronged approach, including synthetic organic chemistry, mass spectrometry-based bioanalytical chemistry, and molecular biology to achieve a molecular-level understanding about how the under-investigated group of alkylated thymidine lesions impede DNA replication and transcription in cells, and induce mutations in these processes. We will also assess the implications of nucleotide excision repair and base excision repair pathways in the repair of these lesions in cells. The outcome of the proposed research will bring our understanding of this largely overlooked group of alkylated DNA lesions to a significantly higher level."
"9349048","SUMMARY  We propose to screen a panel of human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to HIV-1 gp41 to identify the mAb that penetrates a model of the human blood brain barrier (BBB) most efficiently. We will test the use this mAb as a reagent for radioimmunotherapy (RIT) of the reservoir of HIV-1-infected cells in the central nervous system (CNS). During antiretroviral therapy (ART) which poorly cross BBB many HIV patients demonstrate HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders and neuroAIDS that continue to be a major public health problem. Migration of HIV-infected monocytes across the BBB causes neuroinflammation, which promotes dementia despite ART. Our in vitro and in vivo studies using human anti-gp41 mAb radiolabeled with the ?-particles- emitting radionuclide 213Bismuth revealed its ability to kill HIV-1-infected cells. We also showed the ability of this radiolabeled mAb to traverse a model of the human BBB in a manner that depends on its isoelectric point (pI) suggesting its therapeutic potential to treat HIV-related brain disorders. The in vitro BBB model is well established, tested and validated in a number of studies and several laboratories. This BBB model mimics the human BBB and uses astrocytes and brain microvascular endothelial cells which are cultured on both sides of a permeable membrane. We hypothesize that selection of new anti-gp41 mAbs with high pIs will increase the efficiency of radiolabeled mAb crossing BBB, and will kill HIV-1-infected cells on the CNS side of the BBB. Three specific aims are proposed: in Aim 1 we will screen a large panel of ~80 human anti-gp41 mAbs received from several sources including a panel of 16 mAbs produced in our laboratory. We will select mAbs with the highest isoelectric points that permit efficient passage across the BBB, high avidity binding to gp41 and broad binding to transfected cells expressing envelope proteins of viruses representing five different HIV-1 subtypes. In aim 2 we will concentrate on improving the binding capabilities of mAbs; the selected anti-gp41 mAbs in aim 1 will be used to produce bispecific antibodies with high pIs that target two different gp41 epitopes to increase their efficiency of targeting the broad spectrum of HIV-1-infected cells. We will also use molecular techniques to produce F(ab')2 fragments from selected anti-gp41 mAbs to investigate whether their smaller size increase their abilities to cross the model BBB. Aim 3 will test the efficiency of radiolabeled anti-gp41 mAbs to kill HIV-1-infected cells after penetration the BBB model. Given that transmission through the BBB model is time-dependent we will test mAbs labeled with three radionuclides with different half-life to select the most efficient construct. The radiolabeled anti-gp41 mAb can be used for future experiments in non-human primates infected with SHIV, and ultimately clinical trials."
"9567059","ABSTRACT  22q11Deletion Syndrome (22q11DS) patients have feeding and swallowing difficulties that compromise their  nutritional status and increase nasal, middle ear, and respiratory infections due to aspiration and reflux. The  causes of these clinically significant difficulties are unknown. Using the genetically accurate LgDel mouse  model of 22q11DS, which has similar phenotypic features, we found that retinoic acid-mediated anterior-  posterior patterning of the hindbrain is altered, and that several of the cranial nerves that control feeding and  swallowing have aberrant growth patterns early in development. These observations suggest that aberrant  development of the hindbrain motor and/or sensory neurons leads to dysfunction of the network of cranial  neurons that are needed to execute feeding and swallowing. We will test the hypothesis that diminished  22q11 gene dosage disrupts anterior-posterior (A-P) hindbrain patterning via retinoic acid (RA)  signaling, and thereby re-specifies brainstem and/or neural crest precursor cells, leading to dysphagia.  Our experiments in Specific Aim 1 will quantify RA production to assess excess ligand availability, measure  hindbrain RA responses to evaluate enhanced RA sensitivity, and determine changes of additional patterning  centers and their targets in LgDel embryos where anterior CNs are compromised, Tbx1+/- where they are  spared, and LgDel:Raldh2+/- where they are rescued. To identify genes that, if mutated, predispose at-risk  fetuses to dysphagia, in Specific Aim 2 we will compare transcriptomes from the hindbrains of WT embryos,  LgDel embryos in which RA signaling is enhanced, and LgDel:Raldh2+/- embryos in which it is returned to WT  levels. Finally, in Specific Aim 3 we will characterize position, molecular identity, frequency, proliferative,  and/or migratory capacities of anterior versus posterior hindbrain motor neuron, interneuron, pre-migratory and  migratory neural crest precursors in LgDel embryos in which anterior CNs are compromised, Tbx1+/- in which  they are spared, and LgDel:Raldh2+/- in which they are rescued. The results of PROJECT 2 will establish the  developmental origins of pediatric dysphagia pathology defined by PROJECT 1, and determine how these  mechanisms contribute to specific aspects of disrupted feeding and swallowing. Our data will define new  molecular pathways for fetal and early postnatal diagnosis, and targeted therapeutic interventions.  Experiments in PROJECT 3 will evaluate the precision of these targets for correcting key aspects of dysphagia  pathology in fetuses at risk for perinatal feeding and swallowing difficulties."
"9384955","Abstract Aberrant proliferation of epithelial stem cells in the adult prostate can contribute to hyperplastic growth (e.g., benign prostatic hyperplasia, BPH) and subsequent quality of life challenges. Despite intensive study, little is known about the prostate epithelial stem cell hierarchy and resulting lineage relationships. Bona fide epithelial stem cells are defined by their self-renewal, multipotency, and regenerative capabilities. Additionally, it is thought that prostatic stem cells can survive without androgen signaling, in contrast to differentiated cells. The mentor's lab has previously shown that the transcription factor Sox2, well known for its roles in maintenance of embryonic stemness, is expressed in adult murine and human prostate epithelium. Further, unpublished data from the mentor's lab indicate that Sox2+ cells are formed just prior to embryonic development of the prostate and can persist after androgen deprivation. Using a genetic lineage tracing strategy, we have observed that Sox2-expressing cells of the prostate can persist long- term (over 3 months), suggesting that they may be progenitor cells. Defining the contribution of Sox2+ cells to tissue homeostasis and regeneration is essential to understanding the prostate stem cell lineage hierarchy, a current gap in knowledge in the field. These data are critical to development of novel strategies that target progenitor cell populations in BPH, an unmet therapeutic need. However, it remains unclear whether Sox2+ cells are bona fide stem cells and/or are required for tissue development and homeostasis. The scientific objective of this application is therefore to bridge this knowledge gap by studying the contributions of Sox2+ cells to the homeostasis of prostate epithelium in health and disease. The proposal is innovative because it will be the first to determine whether Sox2 expression maintains adult prostate stem cells, which has not been previously investigated. The proposed research is significant because it will link specific regulatory mechanisms of stem cell maintenance to benign prostatic hyperplasia, allowing therapeutic exploitation of fundamental cellular processes. In addition to benefitting diseases associated with prostatic hyperplasia, the concepts and tools developed may be applicable to the study of epithelial stem cells for diseases of other organs that are driven by hormonal dysfunction."
"9355597","Obesity is one of the most prevalent and challenging public health issues of our time. In November 2011, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) approved the use of a new Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System (HCPCS) code for payment in primary care for providing Intensive Behavioral Therapy (IBT) treatment for obese patients. Despite the widespread prevalence of obesity in the Medicare population, use of this benefit has been substantially lower than expected suggesting significant underutilization of this benefit. This exploratory study will pursue the following aims: 1) To develop a thorough understanding of the most pressing issues related to the use and non-use of the Medicare IBT for obesity benefit in primary care, and 2) To study the strategies used in practices that have successfully implemented services in accordance with the IBT for obesity Medicare benefit and describe: a) characteristics of these practices and their environmental context, b) key elements of the implementation process that facilitate successful in-practice intervention, c) patients use of the IBT for obesity benefit, including continuing receipt of services after meeting the weight loss requirement of the benefit, and d) cost to provide the service relative to the reimbursement amount. To accomplish aim 1, we will query the Medicare Provider Utilization and Payment Data: Physician and Other Supplier database for three states: Colorado, Michigan, and North Carolina and identify all providers and their practices that have been paid by Medicare for delivering IBT for obesity services to 10 or more beneficiaries in a year between 2012 and 2014. We will identify the primary care practices of these providers and conduct semi-structured telephone interviews with the universe of practices (up to 100 total). We will then identify practices that are not using the IBT benefit, matched on zip code, practice size (>5 providers), and family or internal medicine to practices using the benefit and conduct similar interviews with this group. Interviews will assess practice characteristics, reasons for use, non-use and stopping use of the benefit, processes and personnel involved, and any known patient results. To accomplish aim 2, we will purposefully select 36 practices from aim 1 that meet our criteria for IBT for obesity implementation success to collect in- depth information to understand their implementation, patient outcomes and costs. Data gathering will include on-site interviews and observations, and EMR data extraction. Normalization process theory will be used to understand factors important to implementation. These methods will also be used to obtain information to estimate the cost to the practice of providing IBT services and assess its sustainability under current and alternative reimbursement amounts. Our findings have direct policy implications informing the dissemination and sustainability of effective implementation strategies that can be learned from practices continuing to deliver IBT for obesity services. This study will add to the field by determining the use of this benefit, reasons for use and discontinuation of use, and identify potential strategies for effective implementation of IBT in primary care."
"9371064","Abstract  Cancer immunotherapy is emerging as a new paradigm for the treatment of cancer by targeting the body's immune system instead of tumor. Clinical approvals of several check point inhibitors (e.g., Ipilimumab, Pembrolizumab) have shown durable response in a small subset of melanoma patients over conventional chemotherapy. Despite these successes, many cancers are poorly immunogenic and do not generate adequate cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) and therefore these patients cannot benefit from immune checkpoint therapies. The long-term goal of this application is to establish STING-activating polymeric nanovaccines for cytotoxic T cell therapy of melanoma. We will capitalize on the discovery of an ultra-pH sensitive polymer (PC7A) that allows optimal spatio-temporal orchestration of cytosolic delivery of tumor antigen (Ag) in dendritic cells and innate stimulation for the robust production of tumor-specific CTLs. A simple physical mixture of Ag-PC7A NP resulted in a robust Th1 and CTL (>80%) response without the need of innate stimulants (i.e., CpG, Poly(I:C)). Use of tumor associated antigens (TAAs) have shown significantly increased antitumor efficacy in a B16F10 melanoma model in mice. We will test the central hypothesis that PC7A nanoparticle vaccine will synergize with checkpoint inhibition to allow a safe and efficacious T cell therapy of melanoma. There are three specific aims: (1) Expand the nanovaccine platform to multiple melanoma peptide antigens; (2) Evaluate the safety of the polymeric nanovaccines in healthy, immunocompetent animals; and (3) Evaluate the antitumor efficacy of the polymer nanovaccines and its synergy with checkpoint inhibition. Accomplishments of the above aims will provide critical data for clinical translation of the nanovaccines for melanoma therapy. We will also collaborate with other nanoalliance members to test the PC7A NP in additional cancer indications."
"9272055","PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT  Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) is a clinical syndrome characterized by the presence of Lewy body disease (LBD), but additional Alzheimer's disease (AD)-related pathology is also common in patients with DLB. Although the impact of each of these two pathologies on the clinical disease progression is not fully understood, many DLB patients may benefit from treatments that target both AD and LBD-related pathological processes. To prepare for these clinical trials in DLB, we need robust and reliable biomarkers that can track disease progression, particularly the progression of both LBD- and AD-related pathologies. We propose multi-modal imaging biomarkers of pathological processes commonly present in patients with DLB to detect disease progression. We propose to establish a longitudinal cohort of patients with DLB and acquire clinical and multi-modal imaging biomarker data to model the longitudinal imaging biomarker changes with respect to clinical disease progression in DLB. In Aim 1, we propose to determine whether LBD-related dopaminergic loss on SPECT, and AD pathophysiology measured with higher amyloid-? deposition on PET and AD-signature atrophy on MRI is associated with the rate of clinical disease progression, cognitive decline and survival in DLB; In Aim 2, we will determine whether these longitudinal changes in imaging biomarkers and clinical outcomes, and their associations are modified by genetic, sex- based, and cerebrovascular disease-related features. In Aim 3, we will determine the pattern of a tau ligand AV-1451 uptake in DLB compared to controls and its relationship to the rate of change in imaging biomarkers and clinical disease progression. Finally, we will determine the pathologic basis of the biomarker changes in DLB in autopsied patients, which is the gold standard for validating imaging biomarkers in Aim 4. In addition to these aims that focus on hypothesis testing, we will respond to RFA-NS- 16-022 by collecting whole blood, plasma, serum, CSF, and urine samples, clinical and harmonized neuroimaging data longitudinally; DNA and peripheral blood mononuclear cells from a prospective cohort of DLB patients, and submit them to the PDBP."

"9434036","Project Summary  The goal of the proposed research is to fully develop and characterize the ultrasound/tissue communication channel and to demonstrate wireless control of an implanted medical device (IMD) and live video streaming through tissue via the ultrasound communication channel. The development of new enabling technologies to provide the means for personalizing medical care is highly significant. Among these enabling technologies, wearable medical devices or IMDs in humans will play a pivotal role in providing continuous diagnostic information without the need for the patient to visit the clinic. In the near future, diagnostic information from such devices will interact with external wireless networks to send diagnostic information to physicians for clinical evaluation. While sending information from wearable medical devices to external wireless devices for transmission to the clinic is straightforward, transmission of diagnostic information from IMDs to an external device is still a developing technology. To realize wireless communication with IMDs, communication channels from an external device to the IMD must be high speed, safe, low power, reliable and the transmission and receiving elements on the IMD need to be small in size.  To meet these needs, communication channels are being explored to transmit diagnostic information from IMDs to external receivers and vice versa. Up to now, the acoustic or ultrasonic communication channel has been overlooked primarily because it was thought that ultrasonic communication rates are too slow for transmitting information such as medical diagnostics. However, recently in our laboratory, we demonstrated the capability to transmit acoustic information at clinical ultrasonic frequencies with data rates of 120 Mbps, a new world record. Further, we demonstrated 30 Mbps data rates through thick layers of pork loin and beef liver. The development of an ultrasonic communication channel in the body will have a significant impact in medical care. However, this technology must be demonstrated in tissues and living systems and its capabilities well documented and developed. The development and demonstration of the ultrasonic communication channel in tissues will provide a safe, reliable and high speed alternative to conventional electromagnetic communications. To develop and demonstrate the ultrasonic communication channel for biomedical applications we have proposed two specific aims. Our first specific aim is to develop and characterize the acoustic communication channel and integration of ultrasonic sources with small devices to transfer data through tissue. For this aim we will quantify the communication efficiencies in tissues versus attenuation, penetration depth and data rate using transducers having different bandwidths, directionalities and output properties. In the second aim we will demonstrate the ability to communicate diagnostic information and video streaming through tissues at high data rates (i.e., >10 Mbps) using ultrasound. The demonstrations will include controlling of a device implanted and live video streaming through large tissue samples and in vivo in rabbits."
"9332115","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The SEARCH for Diabetes in Youth Study documented a 31% increase in the prevalence of type 2 diabetes (T2D) between 2001 and 2009, as well as an increase of 21 % in the prevalence of type 1 diabetes (T1D). Increases occurred across most but not all major subgroups of age, sex and race/ethnicity. Further, we documented an annual increase in the incidence of T1D among non-Hispanic White (NHW) youth of approximately 2.7% per year. In contrast, studies from Europe suggest that incidence of T1D may be stabilizing. Thus, compelling questions remain regarding long term trends in incidence and prevalence for both T1 and T2 in youth, particularly among various racial and ethnic population subgroups. Ongoing, efficient surveillance of diabetes diagnosed in youth is essential to inform health care systems and generate testable hypotheses related to the natural history of diabetes in youth. SEARCH is uniquely positioned to address these critical questions through continued surveillance of childhood diabetes employing our well-established infrastructure for surveillance, and its highly experienced, collaborative and multi-disciplinary investigative team. Therefore, in response to RFA-DP-15-002, Component A, we propose the continuation of the SEARCH for Diabetes in Youth Registry Study (SEARCH Phase 4) during which we will continue to ascertain newly diagnosed incident diabetes cases throughout the study period and one additional prevalent cohort (index year 2017) for youth age < 20 years across our five well-established geographically dispersed Study Centers. Our approach is informed by our substantial accrued experience that allows us to conduct surveillance work in a highly efficient manner. We frame our surveillance as an innovative three-tiered approach, starting with the most broad based and cost efficient approach at the highest tier (tier 1) and becoming the most focused in tier 3, with each tier optimizing use of electronic health records (EHRs). Specific Aims are: Aim 1: TIER 1 SURVEILLANCE (Prevalence)- To ascertain cases of prevalent diabetes in calendar year 2017 among youth age < 20 years at diagnosis; Aim 2: TIER 2 SURVEILLANCE (Incidence)- To continue to ascertain newly diagnosed (2015-2020) incident diabetes cases in youth age < 20 years; Aim 3: TIER 3 SURVEILLANCE (Clinical Characteristics) - To confirm classification of diabetes type using biochemical markers, to describe selected clinical characteristics at diagnosis, and to maintain an infrastructure that facilitates the development of more detailed ancillary studies by storing biological samples and preserving contact with potential study participants; Aim 4: OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCY: To optimize efficiency of the SEARCH Surveillance activities through targeted development and validation projects designed to utilize relevant electronic health data to operationalize each of the three tiers of surveillance. Thus, the well-established and highly productive SEARCH team is uniquely positioned to provide critical information on the prevalence, incidence and early clinical course of diabetes in youth."
"9473358","PROJECT SUMMARY Image-guidance has not been widely adopted in open lumbar fusion procedures because of cumbersome patient registration techniques. Accumulated mobility between vertebrae prohibits use of skin-affixed fiducials (requiring the surgeon to identify, expose, and localize anatomical landmarks within the surgical field), and registration at the start of surgery does not compensate for intervertebral motion between preoperative supine CT scans and intraoperative prone patient position. An automated registration procedure could accelerate adoption and improve outcomes, in addition to reducing costs, complexity, and x-ray dose associated with spine surgical guidance methods in current clinical use. Our target population is patients with symptomatic lumbar degenerative spondylolisthesis, where open decompression and fusion surgery, performed more than 300,000 times annually, improves patient-reported outcomes compared to non-surgical treatment. Image- guidance allows more accurate placement of pedicle screws, which could reduce revision rates and minimize patient harm, thereby allowing hospitals and surgeons to avoid reimbursement penalties from Medicare and other payers. We have developed an automated image-based intraoperative stereovision (iSV) to preoperative CT (pCT) registration that compensates for intervertebral motion, and have successfully applied the technique in two live animals, achieving excellent target registration errors (TREs less than 2.1 mm). We now propose to improve technical aspects of the approach in experimental studies and assess feasibility of this novel registration technology for clinical implementation. Specifically, we will (i) develop a portable iSV scanner as a radiation-free alternative to intraoperative CT (iCT) or O-arm, (ii) validate, evaluate and optimize the tehcnique in a systematic series of live animal surgeries, and (iii) translate the technology into a series of human cases of open lumbar fusion for degenerative spondylolisthesis. Comparisons of the new iSV approach to standard-of- care image-guidance with a commercial system (e.g., Medtronic StealthStation) and to high-fidelity navigation achieved with iCT will be performed to establish the relative performance improvements that can be obtained."
"9381503","Project Summary Disparities in surgical care, including access to and quality of care, are pervasive and long standing in our healthcare system. Black patients are much less likely to receive life-saving or life-enhancing surgical procedures, and when they do, they are more likely to experience poor clinical outcomes, including higher readmission rates and mortality, compared with white patients. We know, for instance, that there are racial disparities in surgical readmissions but we don't understand the reasons that underlie these differences. Reducing surgical readmissions has become a national priority because it likely reflects complex and critical aspects of care that requires communication and coordination between providers and patients, appropriate recovery from complications, and generally safer, better care. There have been a series of national programs, culminating in specific initiatives under the Affordable Care Act, which have focused on reducing readmissions. As these national programs have taken hold, we have little information about whether there have been reductions in surgical disparities. Just as importantly, we know little about the specific initiatives that organizations have undertaken to reduce disparities and achieve greater health equity. Therefore, we propose to use ten years of longitudinal national Medicare data to examine trends in 30-day surgical readmissions rates in black and white patients, determine whether differences have narrowed over time, identify market-level and hospital-level factors that are associated with the greatest improvement in disparities, and finally, using a national survey of hospital leaders, determine promising strategies to improve outcomes of minority populations. As the nation continues to shift towards value-based care, assessing what progress has been made in reducing disparities in surgical care, where gaps still persist, and what kinds of readmissions strategies appear most promising are all critical to informing future policy and clinical efforts to reduce gaps and ensure greater equity in surgical care."
"9316389","Project Summary Visual perception is mediated by complex interactions amongst neurons in the retina, visual cortex, and subcortical brain structures. The importance of vision to humans and other primates is reflected in the enormous percentage of cerebral cortex devoted to processing visual information. Thus, deficits in visual processing are particularly debilitating and arise from abnormalities not only in the eye, but also in cortical circuitry. For example, strabismus or amblyopia during childhood can have long-lasting effects on the cortical circuits that process visual information. There is also evidence that some forms of dyslexia result from central visual system abnormalities. The function of the nervous system is dependent on complex interactions between networks of neurons composed of multiple neuron types across multiple cortical areas. The proposed studies are aimed at revealing the organization and functional impact of local and long-distance feedback connections within and between mouse visual cortical areas. These studies are conducted in mice to take advantage of the range of molecular, genetic, and viral tools that can be used to elucidate brain circuits and link them to function using optogenetic and imaging methods. The 2 aims will reveal: the fine-scale organization of V1 microcircuits linking cortical layers 2/3 and 5, and the functional impact of feedback from layer 5 to layer 2/3; and the organizational principles and functional impact of cortico-cortical feedback."
"9305578","There continues to be an overarching problem of high mortality and poor outcome for victims of severe traumatic brain injury (TBI). Preclinical and clinical investigations indicate that hyperbaric oxygen (HBO2) has a positive impact on reducing brain injury and improving outcomes in severe TBI. By markedly increasing oxygen (O2) delivery to the traumatized brain, HBO2 can reverse the lack of O2 that precipitates cellular energy failure and subsequent brain cell death. In past clinical investigations, HBO2 in comparison to standard care has significantly improved energy production in the brain and improved clinical outcome. However, prior to a formal phase III definitive efficacy study, important information is required regarding optimizing the HBO2 treatment schedule to be instituted in terms of pressure and frequency and other parameters. The lungs in severe TBI patients have frequently been compromised by direct lung injury and/or acquired ventilator pneumonia and are susceptible to O2 toxicity. It is essential to determine the most effective HBO2 dose schedule without producing O2 toxicity and clinical complications. This proposed adaptive clinical trial is designed to answer these questions and to provide important data to plan a definitive phase III efficacy trial.  Primary aims of this trial are to select, in patients with severe TBI, the combination of HBO2 treatment parameters that is most likely to demonstrate improvement in the outcome of severe TBI patients in a subsequent phase III trial. Also the trial will determine, in patients with severe TBI, whether there is a > 50% probability of HBO2 treatment demonstrating improvement in the outcome of severe TBI in a subsequent confirmatory phase III trial.  This trial is supported and sponsored by the Neurological Emergency Treatment Trial (NETT) Network which is funded by the National Institutes of Neurologic Disease and Stroke to conduct clinical trials such as the one described. The NETT helps ensure a well-planned and well-conducted clinical trial."
"9341379","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose to develop a bioinformatics toolbox to process and quantify complex muscle cell images for automated phenotype analysis. The toolbox is aimed to provide both clinical practitioners and laboratory investigators with the much-needed capability to automatically detect and identify pathological features that manifest themselves in many muscle-related diseases such as cardiomyopathy, muscular hypertrophy, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) (often known as Lou Gehrig's disease), muscular dystrophies such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy and Becker muscular dystrophy, and inflammatory muscle damage. Many of these conditions have no effective treatment and high fatality rates. For example, ALS is progressive neurodegenerative disease that is caused by the death of motor neurons and results in increasing muscle weakness and atrophy, has a survival rate less than twenty percent over a five-year period, and the disease affects more 5,000 people in the U.S. each year. In our search for treatment for the muscle-related diseases, lack of computational method to objectively and quantitatively analyze muscle cell images has become a rate limit factor. As clinicians and researchers are increasingly looking into the cellular and molecular mechanisms of the diseases, detailed pathological analysis is necessary for people to understand the biological processes. Yet, the only available approach is manual analysis which is confined to small datasets and qualitatively interpretation of the images. Important pathological features may be missed by manual analysis or obscured due to the large variation in human observation. Also results of manual analysis are not immediately ready for data management and analysis because of the long time it takes. Hence we identified the need for a dedicated toolbox to facilitate muscle-related research, which was confirmed by our user community.      Featuring novel imaging processing algorithms, the toolbox will quantitatively analyze muscle cells, integrate results from multiple channels, and export quantitative results, with little user intervention. The toolbox will advance clinical and laboratory research by providing detailed analysis of histopathological features such as the intact of cellular membrane, the location of nuclei, and geometric measurements of the cells. It will facilitate discovery by highlighting subtl yet important information in histopathology, reducing human errors, and enabling research to analyze a larger number of images than they currently are able to. The toolbox will also improve workflow in clinics and laboratories by providing users with high sensitivity, objectivity, and efficiency in interpreting muscle cell images. The quantifying capability of the toolbox will allow users to compare therapeutic treatments with a high confidence level.      Overall the project will benefit the large biomedical community of treating and researching muscle-related diseases. In turn, the project will benefit the patients of muscular diseases by facilitating diagnosis of muscular disorders and discovery of new therapies."
"9303876","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Keratins are the most abundant proteins in surface epithelia, in which they occur as a cytoplasmic network of 10 nm wide intermediate filaments (IFs). Keratins are encoded by an evolutionarily conserved multigene family, with 54 individual members subdivided into two major types (I and II). The pairwise regulation of type I and type II keratin genes in epithelia reflects a strict heteropolymerization requirement. In addition, keratin  genes are regulated in an epithelial tissue-type and differentiation-specific fashion, the functional basis of which is only partly understood. A major role fulfilled by keratin IFs in vivo s to act as a resilient scaffold that endows epithelial cells with the ability to sustain mechanical and non-mechanical stresses. Inherited mutations affecting the coding sequence of keratins account for a large number of epithelial fragility disorders. Several additional functions, which are non-mechanical in nature and manifested in a keratin- and context-dependent fashion, have been identified by us and other researchers in recent years. Here we seek to further our understanding of the mechanisms underlying the structural support function of keratins by focusing on Krt5-Krt14 filaments, which occur in progenitor basal keratinocytes of epidermis and are causally mutated in the disease Epidermolysis Bullosa Simplex (EBS). During the last period of support we investigated the remarkable property of self-organization of Krt5-Krt14 filaments, in vitro and in vivo, and succeeded in crystallizing, for the first time, a portion of te interacting Krt5-Krt14 rod domains. The resulting atomic structure revealed a role for disulfide binding in organizing Krt5-Krt14 IFs into a perinuclear cage in epidermal keratinocytes, with an impact on the size and shape of the nucleus. Going forward we posit that the Krt5-Krt14 pairing is amenable to further crystallization and structure determination (we already determined a second Krt5-Krt14 structure), with unprecedented insight for keratin IF properties and its defect in EBS and related genodermatoses. Moreover, we also posit that intracellular, inter-keratin disulfide bonding represents a major mechanism to regulate the organization of keratin IFs in vivo, determine the filament lifespan (i.e., half- life), and regulate nuclear architecture and keratinocyte differentiation in vivo. In Aim 1, we will: (a) relate specific disulfide bonds involvng Krt5 and Krt14 to specific spatial configurations of IFs in keratinocytes; (b) identify the determinants of keratin filament half-life in epidermal keratinocytes, with an emphasis on disulfide bonding; and (c) assess the functional importance of inter-keratin disulfide bonding in mouse skin tissue. In Aim 2, we will use X-ray crystallography to determine the atomic structure of (a) the heterodimer and (b) the heterotetramer of Krt5 and Krt14 rod domains. Success with this latter effort will help define how EBS-causing mutations impact the structure and properties of Krt5-Kr14 subunits. The proposed research is highly original, addresses crippling knowledge deficiencies in the field, and is poised to deepen our understanding of the mechanistic underpinnings of the clinically-relevant structural support function of keratin filaments in vivo."
"9404181","Abstract DNA nanoparticles have been tested in CF patients and shown to be safe and able to deliver nucleic acids to the airway. We have reported that nucleolin interaction with glucocorticoid receptor (GR) is essential for cellular binding and transfection of DNPs and discovered that DNPs interact with other proteins in human primary airway epithelial cells, including adenomatous polyposis coli (APC), and non-erythrocytic spectrin alpha 1 (SPTAN1). These interactions can significantly modulate DNPs-mediated gene transfer, which prompts our hypothesis that DNP interaction with GR, HSP90, APC, and SPTAN1 modulate nucleolin-mediated transport of the particles and that the interactions can be manipulated with agents approved in humans to enhance gene delivery in vivo. To investigate the hypothesis, our specific aims are: 1) To evaluate the impact of manipulating the DNP interactome on gene delivery and toxicity in vivo; and 2) To examine the mechanisms that enhance gene transfer in well differentiated airway epithelial cells from CF patients. The proposed studies will be the first to explore the biology of DNPs and improve our understanding of important steps in delivery. Furthermore, the studies have the potential of defining small molecules already approved for use in humans as agents that can be administered before or during nanoparticle administration to significantly enhance gene transfer of CFTR into the therapeutic range."
"9483059","Summary of Work Malignant gliomas confer a dismal prognosis and have an inherent tendency to recur despite the most aggressive of therapies. Recently, significant progress has been made in both understanding the genetic foundation of these tumors as well as how to harness the power of the immune system to target these most devastating tumors. While there has been substantial evidence in support of using T cells to treat established tumors in mice and humans, the translational value of these treatments has been limited by the simplicity of glioma models used for their development: mostly relying on transplanted tumors that do not recapitulate the immune microenvironment present in human gliomas. To this end, this proposal seeks to develop a spontaneous and genetically faithful mouse glioma model by combining the initial IDH1R132H driver mutation with other most common mutations. These models will maintain the integrity of the immune microenvironment of the brain and best recapitulating human glioma. With these models, we will also assess the interplay between glioma development and the immune response as dictated by different genetic mutations.  Our second aim is to identify IDH1R132H reactive T cell antigen receptors (TCRs). We aim to improve the current technology which employs single cell RNAseq to clone both the TCR? and TCR? chains. We will optimize the current cloning procedures to dramatically reduce the reagent expense and labor cost, which is essential for its clinical application. This aim will be extended into a translational direction, aim 3, through genetic engineering of T cells to redirect their antigen specificity against IDH1R132H. This aim is essentially a proof-of-principle study for TCR-T adoptive transfer immunotherapy in our immune-competent mouse glioma models.  Combined, novel animal models and technologies developed in this study will help elucidate the complexities underlying glioma genetics and how these commonly mutated genes contribute to glioma development, progression, and glioma-specific immune suppression mechanisms. In addition, this will also facilitate the development and implementation a novel strategy for glioma immunotherapy."
"9551228","While there is already a healthy web-based research ecosystem for cancer genomics data including the OICR team?s own ICGC portal, cBioPortal, the UCSC Cancer Genome Browser, and MyCancerGenome there is no comprehensive portal for pediatric cancers, which are distinct in etiology and genomic profile from adult cancers. More seriously, there are scant web-or application-based tools to assist researchers investigating the causes and consequences of structural birth defects (or germline diseases in general), and no online resources whatsoever that combine the phenotypic and genotypic information for these two classes of pediatric disease. This is despite abundant evidence that structural birth defects and pediatric cancers share common etiologies and biological pathways: both involve genomic variations in genes involved in development and homeostasis, both are driven upward in risk by rare germline variants, and many structural birth defect syndromes, including such relatively common syndromes as Down, Klinefelter, Wiskott-Aldrich, Noonan, and Perlman, are associated with elevated cancer risk. This project will bring together the pediatric cancer and structural birth defect research communities, providing a unique opportunity to leverage the information gathered by one community to acquire insights in the other, and to recognize and promote collaborations among the two disciplines. As the project?s chief outward-facing tool, the data resource portal will serve the needs of four groups of users: (1) biomedical researchers, who require deep access to the Kids First data sets and the ability to perform broad integrative queries and analytics across multiple data sets; (2) clinicians, who require concise summaries of the state of knowledge of pediatric cancers and congenital birth defects; (3) data scientists, who will build analytic pipelines, knowledge bases and other tools and services on top of the portal; and (4) patients and their family members, who will look to Kids First as a community resource for learning about their disease, and for finding support groups and other disease-related resources. The portal will bring together this heterogeneous user base to participate in a fertile ecosystem for research, study and collaboration built on top of an unprecedented collection of genetic and phenotypic data from pediatric patients. This will catalyze the advancement of personalized medicine for the detection, therapy and management of childhood cancer and birth defects."
"9440538","We are applying to participate as an APOLLO Clinical Center in this national prospective study. The NIH APOL1 Long-term Transplantation Outcomes Network (APOLLO) Collaborative U01 will perform a national prospective evaluation of donor and recipient APOL1 renal-risk variants in all U.S. kidney transplantations from African American donors to determine their effects on transplant outcomes. In addition, the health of living African American kidney donors will be assessed. Information that was lacking from prior retrospective studies needs to be collected, including renal histologic data in allograft failures and presence or development of BK viral infections, donor specific antibodies, and acute rejections after kidney transplantation. Our investigative team, led by two PIs with complementary expertise, has led the way in clinical trials to address the marked disparities in African Americans with end-stage kidney disease. Renal transplantations from deceased African American kidney donors do not last as long as those from deceased European American kidney donors. Reasons for this are unknown, but retrospective reports suggest that presence of two apolipoprotein L1 (APOL1) gene renal-risk variants in kidney donors may contribute. These renal-risk variants are common in populations with recent African ancestry (such as African Americans), where they are strongly associated with non-diabetic end-stage kidney disease. In contrast, these risk variants are rare in other ethnic groups. APOL1 genotype data may prove to be clinically useful in those with recent African ancestry in the setting of allocation of deceased donor kidneys for transplantation and assessment of prospective living kidney donors. Genotypic information (precision medicine) may provide more accurate assessment of the likelihood for long-term renal allograft function in donor kidneys, thereby improving the matching of donor kidneys with potential recipients to optimize renal allograft and patient survival. Information may better inform physicians about organ quality prior to decisions on allocation. However, before these genotypic data can be used in the clinical setting, a prospective national study is required to evaluate kidney transplantation outcomes from African American donors and recipients of their kidneys based on APOL1 genotypes. Information lacking from prior retrospective studies will be collected, including renal histologic data in allograft failures and presence or development of BK viral infections, donor specific antibodies, and acute rejections after kidney transplantation. This is the rationale and setting for the current APOLLO trial. In this important multi-site study, our site will work closely with the APOLLO Scientific and Data Research Center and the other participating sites to recruit and prospectively follow eligible kidney donors and transplant recipients based on the APOLLO protocol. Results have the potential to transform the organ allocation and informed consent processes in kidney transplantation, optimize renal allograft survival, reduce the discard of good-quality kidneys, and protect the health of living kidney donors."
"9382204","Project Summary: Optic nerve damage is a primary contributor to debilitating vision loss in glaucoma. The prevalence of glaucoma is increasing in the USA and worldwide and there is an urgent need for new, accessible treatments to improve visual outcomes in glaucoma patients. To date, lowering of intraocular pressure (IOP) remains the only treatment strategy with proven efficacy in preserving vision in glaucoma. However, IOP-lowering drugs and surgeries are not effective in all patients, and many patients with seemingly controlled IOP still experience progressive loss of vision. Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-?) has emerged as playing a key role in progression of optic nerve damage, promoting glial cell activation, extracellular matrix remodeling and, ultimately, formation of glial scar in the optic nerve head (ONH). The overall goal of this application is to provide insight into the effects of blocking angiotensin II type1 receptor (AT1) on glaucoma progression. Our central hypothesis is that AT1 blockade will down-regulate TGF-? expression and pro-fibrotic pathways to ameliorate optic nerve axon loss and glial scarring in glaucoma. In Aim 1: To determine the clinical efficacy of AT1 blocker therapy on the progression of glaucomatous optic neuropathy in vivo, a pre-clinical study will be conducted in a spontaneous glaucoma model. To test the working hypothesis that AT1 blocker therapy will preserve axons and limit scarring in the optic nerve in glaucoma, functional (electrophysiological) and structural (OCT-derived) measures of glaucoma progression in vivo and axon counts in situ will be compared between eyes receiving IOP-lowering therapy alone and in combination with AT1 blocker and untreated eyes, in adult subjects with established glaucoma. In Aim 2: To determine if AT1-blockade affects pathways associated with gliosis and fibrosis in the ONH in this model, gene expression profiling will complement studies that focus on quantifying and localizing mediators of fibrosis in the TGF-? signaling pathway in ONHs in situ in treated subjects relative to untreated controls. These studies will utilize an existing, FDA-approved AT1 blocker with favorable pharmacokinetics, safety profile and unique properties likely to enhance its anti-fibrotic and neuro- protective effects. Significant innovation and strengths of this proposal include the lack of exogenous experimental manipulations to induce glaucoma in a unique, spontaneous model of glaucoma that recapitulates many important features of glaucoma in human patients. The research proposed will enhance mechanistic insight and provide proof of concept that treatment strategies that mitigate the effects of TGF-? signaling limit loss of visual function in spontaneous glaucoma, lending support to a new paradigm for the adjunctive therapy of glaucoma patients."
"9378398","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Diabetic nephropathy is one of the major complications of diabetes, and the leading cause of end stage renal disease in the United States. Histologically diabetic nephropathy is characterized by fibrosis of the glomeruli due to an expansion of the mesangial extracellular matrix (ECM). This excess ECM disrupts the glomerular filtration apparatus leading to a decline in renal function. Mesangial cells produce the ECM that surrounds glomerular capillaries. They express fibronectin (FN) and collagen, and both of these ECM components are up- regulated in diabetic nephropathy. FN matrix also provides a framework for the deposition of other ECM components including collagens. Therefore, deregulation of normal FN matrix assembly can have adverse effects on the overall structure of the ECM, as occurs in glomerulosclerosis. Elevated glucose is a known risk factor for diabetic nephropathy. We have shown that high glucose conditions increase FN matrix assembly by mesangial cells through activation of integrin receptors by a protein kinase C pathway. Integrin binding to FN initiates FN assembly into fibrils by promoting FN-FN interactions. As more FN dimers are incorporated, the nascent fibrils mature into a stable, insoluble FN matrix. This assembly process can be followed by measuring FN in the detergent-insoluble fraction and by analyzing fibril formation using immunofluorescence. In addition to cell signaling, other mechanisms are activated by increases in glucose such as non-enzymatic glycation and lysine acetylation and these might also contribute to excess ECM production. Advanced glycation end-products (AGEs) accumulate on ECM proteins exposed to high glucose conditions. AGEs induce a range of cellular responses usually through the receptor for AGEs (RAGE). Both AGEs and RAGE have been implicated in the development and progression of diabetic nephropathy and our preliminary results show a role for AGEs in stimulating mesangial cell matrix assembly. We will determine the effect of AGEs on FN matrix assembly by treatment of mesangial cells with AGE-modified proteins, and whether the effects result from binding to RAGE by using blocking agents and siRNA knockdown of RAGE. Another protein modification that is affected by hyperglycemic conditions is lysine acetylation, which is increased in animal models of diabetic nephropathy and has been shown to occur on the cytoplasmic tail of ?1 integrins. We will determine whether high glucose induces increased lysine acetylation using anti-acetyl lysine antibodies and whether this alters the level of FN matrix assembly by mesangial cells using deacetylase inhibitors combined with our standard matrix assembly assays. In addition, the effects of acetylation on ?1 integrin activity will be tested by point-mutation studies with established integrin activity assays. There are currently no therapies to reverse the effects of fibrosis. Understanding the mechanisms for increased FN matrix assembly in response to hyperglycemic conditions may provide novel therapeutic targets to stop or slow the accumulation of ECM."
"9387482","Project Summary The U.S. spends far more on health care than other high-income countries. Yet, older adults in the U.S. are sicker and have shorter lives compared to older adults in many other high-income countries and even some middle-income countries. Reasons for the U.S. health disadvantage are not well understood. Substantial health gap between the U.S. older adults and their high income peers persists even after controlling for individual-level factors such as education and behavioral risks. Older adults are more likely to rely on the physical and social environment in their local areas. At the same time, local area-level contextual characteristics vary substantially across countries which might have contributed to differences in health/mortality across countries. However, local amenities and resources have not been examined systematically in efforts to understand difference in older adults' health status across countries. This project will assess whether and, if so, the extent to which local, contextual characteristics explain the poorer health status of older adults in the U.S. compared to England. Using the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) and English Longitudinal Study of Aging (ELSA), - Based on a newly available contextual dataset that is linked to the HRS, we will create a comparable contextual dataset to be linked to the ELSA at each geographic boundary. We will use comparable, local geographic areas between HRS and ELSA by examining county and census track for the U.S. and local authority and middle layer super output area for England. - We will assess the extent to which local contextual measures explain key health and mortality differences between the U.S. and the England. Health outcomes include both comprehensive self-reported health measures, measured physical performances (e.g., gait speed) and cognitive functioning, and biomarkers (e.g., HbA1c) that are comparable between HRS and ELSA. - We will assess differences in income and wealth gradient in health/mortality between the U.S. and England, and assess the extent to which local contextual factors influence the difference. The proposed exploratory and developmental project will contribute to advancing literature in the new directions by providing new insights into potential mechanism whereby local contextual characteristics influence the international health gap. Outcomes from this project will include: contextual datasets linked to the HRS and ELSA; findings on the potential role of local-area environment for the international health gap; and an international research collaboration that will substantially benefit our future study and may ultimately expand research on health differences at older ages beyond HRS and ELSA. 1"
"9554180","Project Summary We wish to understand two important processes that sustain human vision; the visual cycle is responsible for regeneration of photopigment bleached by absorption of visible light and cellular metabolism is required in every living cell to provide energy. To study these processes, we need a method to visualize individual cells and measure molecular dynamics in the living eye. Some of the molecules involved are intrinsically fluorescent, but are inaccessible in the living eye with single- photon fluorescence imaging because the excitation falls outside the range of radiation that can penetrate the optics of the eye. By using considerably longer excitation wavelengths, two-photon excited fluorescence imaging has the potential to excite these otherwise inaccessible fluorophores and provide intrinsic contrast for imaging a number of retinal structures. In our initial experiments, we used an adaptive optics scanning light ophthalmoscope (AOSLO) to image two-photon fluorescence from cone inner segments in the living macaque eye (Hunter et al, 2011). By correcting the longitudinal chromatic aberration and material dispersion of the eye, we plan to improve the efficiency of our imaging systems and develop methodology for reliably imaging both structure and function of multiple retinal layers in the eye. Not only will this capability provide insight into normal cell mosaics and their biochemical processes, it will also improve our understanding of many diseases that impact these retinal biochemical cascades such as Stargardt's disease, macular degeneration and Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy."

"9319044","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Obesity is a leading preventable cause of death in the United States (US) and is one of the most serious public health problems of the 21st century. Recently obesity rates have reached a plateau in the US but have yet to begin to decrease. The physical consequences of overweight and especially obesity can be serious and life- threatening. Diet and physical inactivity are the two major determinants of overweight/obesity and need to be addressed on a population-wide scale for positive changes to occur. Individual behavior change programs have been slow and recidivism has been great. It is increasingly understood that our physical and social environments play a large role in influencing diet and physical activity. The mission of the Tulane PRC (T/PRC), therefore, is to identify and address the physical and social environmental factors influencing obesity and its behavioral determinants (physical activity and diet) through: participatory research focusing on these factors and ways to modify them; collaboration with community partners and policymakers; communication about and dissemination of this research with researchers, public health practitioners, policy-makers, community partners, and the general public; training of students, faculty, public health professionals, organizational partners and community members; maintaining a stable Infrastructure with adequate resources and personnel with appropriate training, experience and expertise along with strong institutional support. The previous two funding cycles of the T/PRC have demonstrated our ability to develop and maintain the key elements of the T/PRC which enable us to conduct the work consistent with our mission, goals and objectives. We are proposing an applied public health intervention research that will address physical and social factors within one intervention neighborhood in New Orleans, the 9th Ward, and compare it to a non-intervention neighborhood, New Orleans East. The overall goal is to conduct applied public health intervention research that will produce sustainable environmental and social improvements in New Orleans' underserved minority neighborhoods and result in increased healthy weight-related behaviors and reduction/prevention of obesity. The primary aim is to reduce Body Mass Index by 1.5% within overweight and obese categories. Multiple strategies will be employed to determine the collective impact on an identified neighborhood with well-defined boundaries, but with enough differences within the neighborhood to determine characteristics of the best setting for maximum impact. A core cohort will be recruited for pre and post assessments, and neighborhood observations will occur for estimate of population-wide use of physical activity and fresh produce venues."
"9392328","Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is characterized by dense stromal reaction, which can promote tumor progression and contribute to chemo-resistance. The dense stroma can serve as a barrier to drug perfusion into the tumor by creating high intra-tumoral interstitial pressure. The dense stromal matrix in PDAC is caused by overproduction of extracellular matrix (ECM), mainly composed of collagens and hyaluronan. Hyaluronan is synthesized by HA synthase enzymes (HASs) and degraded by hyaluronidases (HYALs). Our previous work and other studies have shown that BRD4 protein, which is the most important member of bromodomain and extraterminal domain (BET) family proteins, is overexpressed in PDAC. BET proteins are ?readers? of acetylated chromatin marks. Treatment with BET inhibitors also decreases tumor growth in PDAC mouse models. In this grant application, we propose our novel hypotheses that (1) BET protein inhibition decreases HA accumulation in PDAC tumors by decreasing the HA production. We further hypothesize that (2) BET inhibition will block receptor for HA-mediated motility (RHAMM)- driven oncogenic HA signaling. These hypotheses are based on strong preliminary data. We propose two specific aims. Aim 1: Investigate the role of BET proteins regulating HA levels in PDAC tumors and molecular mechanisms through which. Aim 2: Determine the ability of BET inhibitors to block HA signaling. This proposal includes innovative concept of HA regulation in PDAC, and has high biological and clinical relevance and significance, with potential for developing new therapeutic strategies for PDAC."

"9362021","Cellular function requires the assembly of macromolecular complexes composed of distinct polypeptide subunits that interact in precise ways. Protein sequence is often insufficient to guarantee that in the crowded cellular environment each nascent subunit makes only the correct protein-protein interactions. Incorrect conformations and interactions lead to cellular defects, and human disease. How cells ensure that newly- synthesized polypeptides assemble into functional complexes remains poorly understood. Septin proteins assemble into highly conserved cytoskeletal hetero-oligomers that have emerged as central players in many cellular processes. All septin subunits are structurally related, yet the organization of hetero-oligomers is tightly controlled by mechanisms that remain unclear. Mutations that affect septin protein folding cause male infertility, and misfolding of wildtype septins may contribute to other diseases (e.g. Alzheimer's). Molecular chaperones promote the proper folding and assembly of many proteins, but it is not known if septins are among them. The long-term goal is to understand the molecular requirements for proper de novo assembly of septin hetero- oligomers. The goals of this application are to identify the chaperones that engage yeast septins during de novo biogenesis, to define the molecular features in the septins that mediate these interactions, and to determine their effects on the kinetics of de novo septin folding. A yeast model has been developed to measure the kinetics of septin folding, as well as new tools to rapidly and sensitively map septin-chaperone interactions and identify the order in which they occur along the septin folding pathway. The central hypothesis is that a network of cytosolic chaperones engages nascent septins to promote native folding and functional septin oligomerization. This model was generated from extensive preliminary observations made in the applicant's laboratory. The rationale for this project is that emerging links between septin misfolding and human disease point to the importance of septin folding in septin function, yet the cellular requirements for septin folding are unknown. Deeper understanding of this process may translate directly to insights regarding the molecular basis of septin-associated human diseases. This model will be tested by pursuing two questions formulated as specific aims: (1) How do chaperones recognize nascent septins?; (2) Which chaperones are required for de novo septin folding? In the first aim, cutting-edge in vivo methods are employed to identify septin-chaperone interactions and determine the sequential order in which they occur during septin biogenesis. Powerful genetics are used to dissect the roles of specific regions of individual septins in these associations. The second aim exploits four parallel, independent assays for septin folding to determine which chaperone- septin associations are functionally important. This innovative approach explores for the first time folding roles for septin-interacting chaperones, using methods never before applied to this question. The proposal's significance lies in its potential to explain how septin mutations or chaperone dysfunctions cause disease."
"9482508","Cognitive impairment related to dementia is frequently under-diagnosed in primary care settings despite the availability of numerous assessment tools. Missed detection delays treatment of reversible conditions as well as provision of support services and critical planning. This problem is more prevalent among older African- Americans and Hispanics than among older whites. Our group has two decades of experience developing tools to detect dementia in health disparate populations. Notably, we developed the Picture-based Memory Impairment Screen (PMIS) that relies on culture fair pictures and does not need to be administered by a medical professional. We also validated the Motoric Cognitive Risk syndrome (MCR). This highly accessible test relies on the presence of slow gait and cognitive self-complaints to identify individuals at high risk of converting to dementia. Both the PMIS and the MCR are highly sensitive and specific first-line assays that can be followed up with more thorough and complex cognitive testing. Building on our work, we propose to develop and validate a 5-minute screen (5-Cog) to identify persons at high risk of developing dementia and to flag them for further evaluation. We propose to do this in urban, multi-ethnic Bronx primary care populations with socio-economic challenges. The 5-Cog battery will include the PMIS, MCR syndrome diagnosis, and a 2-item depression screener. In the 18-month UG3 phase, we propose to fine-tune the components of the 5-Cog that will be tested in a health disparate population in the Bronx, and could be extended to other participating sites under this RFA. We will also test the feasibility of administering the 5-Cog by non-physicians to increase accessibility of our battery in primary care settings. In the 42-month UH3 phase, we propose a single-blind, randomized clinical trial in 1,200 older primary care patients presenting with cognitive complaints who will be randomized to receive either the 5-Cog battery (intervention group) or a 5-minute health literacy questionnaire (control group). Non-physicians will administer the intervention and control tests in primary care sites, and test results will be provided to primary care physicians for further action. ?Improved dementia care? will be measured by using a composite endpoint including new Mild Cognitive Impairment syndrome (MCI) or dementia diagnoses, laboratory investigations to rule out reversible causes of cognitive impairment, new dementia medication prescriptions, and specialist or social work referrals. The outcome events will be tracked using our electronic health record system. We will also conduct health care utilization and cost effectiveness analysis of the 5-Cog intervention in real-world settings. By the end of the UH3 phase, we will create a web registry to make 5-Cog test items and procedures available for download by health care professionals. The 5-Cog battery will overcome many of the implementation barriers of previous cognitive screens; it will be fast, low cost, easy to implement (requires only pen, paper and stopwatch), can be administered by non- clinicians after minimal training, not educationally or culturally biased, not confounded by depression and does not require informants."
"9334112","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): It is hypothesized that the degree to which the G protein, Gs?, is associated with lipid rafts is an indicator of both depression and therapeutic response. The original observations suggesting this biosignature were made in postmortem tissue, and we have extended this work with in vivo and in vitro preliminary data suggesting that raft localization of Gs?, determined by simple detergent extraction, is a biomarker of both depression and antidepressant response. There are suggestions that n-3 PUFA either have antidepressant activity or can synergize the action of some antidepressant drugs. To test this, we will use a glial cell line as well as lymphoblasts from depressed subjects who were either antidepressant responsive or unresponsive. This should provide a predictive model for the response to an antidepressant agent, whether that agent is fish oil, citalopram, or some combination. We will test the applicability of the biomarker by measuring the lipid raft distributin of Gs? in membranes from blood cells collected during an NIMH-funded clinical trial showing n-3 PUFA augmentation of antidepressant response. The proposed experiments also attempt to mesh mechanistic preclinical studies with a clinical study to propose and test a biomarker. The preclinical work seeks to determine whether in-vitro treatment with antidepressants ± n-3 PUFA shifts Gs? into non-raft fractions of the plasma membrane, where it more effectively activates adenylyl cyclase. We suggest that a compound with antidepressant efficacy concentrates in cholesterol-rich membrane domains (lipid rafts) and disrupts the anchoring of Gs? within those domains. One possible mechanism for this is direct modification of Gs?. This will be studied by biochemical fractionation of membrane components, fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) and by cellular imaging. Since most antidepressant therapy (save ketamine) requires a time lag prior to therapeutic efficacy and this can be replicated in cells, translocation of Gs? in response to antidepressant agents will be monitored in real time using a fluorescent Gs? fusion protein. Should n-3 PUFA show these biological hallmarks of antidepressant activity, alone or in combination with SSRIs , this will be translated by examining blood taken in a clinical study of the antidepressant efficacy of n-3 PUFA (± SSRIs). Initial data from this study show a greater antidepressant response to n3 PUFA + SSRI than to placebo or SSRI alone. Finally, we will test, with the biochemical and imaging studies, lymphoblasts, derived from depressed patients with known response (or lack thereof) to citalopram. One goal is to develop a high content screen that might suggest, prospectively, the effectiveness of a given potential therapy. Successful completion of the proposed studies will also indicate the usefulness of n-3 PUFA supplementation to antidepressant therapy for decreasing time of therapeutic onset and/or lowering overall antidepressant dose. They will also pave the way toward establishing a low-cost blood biomarker for both depression and antidepressant efficacy over a broad range of agents."
"9426640","PROJECT ABSTRACT Persistence of childhood asthma into adult life has been conclusively linked to long-term lung function deficits and an increased susceptibility to non-fully reversible airflow limitation, the hallmark of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Yet, at the present time there are neither established prediction models nor available biomarkers for early risk identification of long-term sequelae in childhood asthma. In preliminary studies, we found early levels of circulating CC16 ? a pneumoprotein that is produced mainly by club cells in the distal airways and can be measured in circulation ? to be associated with resilience to subsequent lung function deficits and persistent asthma. Of note, these effects were independent of known risk factors for persistent disease. In addition, we found CC16-/- mice to have lung function deficits, airway alterations, and susceptibility to infections by Mycoplasma pneumoniae as compared with wild-type animals. These findings support CC16 in early school age as a strong and independent factor for resilience to persistent disease and long-term sequelae in children with asthma, and suggest that CC16 may exert these effects by modulating susceptibility and responses to airway infections. The present proposal addresses 1) the identification of early determinants of circulating CC16 levels by school-age; 2) the value of levels and trajectories of circulating CC16 in childhood as predictors of persistence and severity of asthma into adult life; and 3) the evaluation of airway responses to asthma pathogens as a potential mechanism mediating CC16 effects on persistent disease."
"9431031","PROJECT ABSTRACT Alzheimer?s disease (AD) is conventionally characterized by specific neuropathological features, including the appearance of extracellular amyloid deposits and the accumulation of intracellular neurofibrillary tangles. While several gene mutations are clearly associated with early onset Alzheimer?s disease, the large number of individuals exhibiting delayed onset, aging-associated AD, are likely to harbor many alterations in linked modifier genes that predispose to AD susceptibility. Genetic and genome wide association studies (GWAS) have identified numerous genes and risk alleles that indicate both cell autonomous and non-cell autonomous mechanisms contributing to loss of neurons and cognitive decline. In this regard, the majority of risk variants identified by GWAS reside in non-coding regions of the genome, implying that they act in part to alter gene expression. This proposal responds to the RFA indicating a particular need for approaches designed to delineate the transcriptional and cellular consequences of combinations of SNPs in the risk alleles by generating new cell line reagents to help unravel the question of the causative SNPs and their target genes in specific neurons derived from iPS cells of AD individuals. There are two features of sporadic AD that require molecular explanation- the potential role of aging in AD susceptibility, and the striking gender disparity, with the incidence of AD being exaggerated in females. These issues can only now be addressed based on new technologies and the availability of patient-derived samples. Our proposed research plan takes advantage of the invaluable samples stored at the brain bank of the Shiley-Marcos Alzheimer's Disease Research Center (ADRC) at UCSD, and the iPSC-derived neurons (Salk). This approach will interrogate the effects of different genetic variants with other risk factors (e.g. age, sex), and assess their effects on cell type-specific enhancer landscapes. By merging these data, we can begin to identify the potential causative SNPs that result in altered function of cell-type specific enhancers. We propose using a high throughput 4C screening approach (UMI-4C), and Hi-ChIP, to identify the most likely causative, enhancer-associated SNPs for functionally-implicated coding target genes. Exploiting the power of contemporary gene editing approaches in control or patient-derived iPS cells to specific neuronal cell types, and to astroglia, we can assess the transcriptional phenotypes and functional behaviors of neurons harboring different combinations of risk alleles, both in the isolated cell lines alone and in combination with coculture experiments with astroglia and microglia, as effects of these SNPs may be manifest only with astroglial:neuronal interactions. Together these studies will use powerful contemporary global genomic approaches to determine the coding transcriptional targets of several of the most significant SNPs in enhancers, and the link to roles of estrogen receptor in the gender disparity for AD."
"9559742","Project Summary  Although amyloid-induced neuroinflammation significantly impairs hippocampal synaptic plasticity and cognitive function, the underlying mechanisms are only partially understood. The long-term goal is to determine the molecular and cellular mechanisms whereby amyloid-induced inflammation leads to synaptic dysfunction and loss to provide new opportunities for development of novel, clinically effective approaches to treating or preventing dementias. The objective in this application is to determine the regulation and function of complement C1q in microglia-mediated pruning of hippocampal glutamatergic synapses. The primary hypothesis is that microglia activated by amyloid fibrils preferentially eliminate hippocampal glutamatergic synapses, a process mediated by the increased expression of C1q in the glutamatergic synapse in the rodent model of Alzheimer's Disease (AD). It is further hypothesized that activation of mGluR-protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) signaling will trigger the dephosphorylation of fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP), thus facilitating the synaptic expression of C1q and the microglial elimination of hippocampal glutamatergic synapses in the rodent model of AD. The rationale for the proposed research is that a mechanistic understanding of microglia-mediated elimination of hippocampal glutamatergic synapses is likely to contribute meaningfully toward the identification of targets for the subsequent development of new preventive or therapeutic interventions for dementia. The central hypothesis will be tested by pursuing three specific aims: 1) Determine the role of microglia pruning in the dysfunction of glutamatergic synapses induced by amyloid fibrils; 2) Determine how complement C1q mediates the microglial pruning of glutamatergic synapses; and 3) Determine the mechanism responsible for C1q upregulation in glutamate synapses. Multiple morphological, molecular, electrophysiological and behavioral approaches will be applied to assess the microglial preferential elimination of glutamatergic synapse induced by the amyloid fibrils and to determine the molecular mechanism and functional significance of this pathologic process in rodent models of AD. The proposed research is innovative, in the PI's opinion, because it, for the first time, focuses on a role for microglial preferential pruning of hippocampal glutamatergic synapses in the setting of AD models. The proposed research is significant because it is expected to constitute the first step in a continuum of research that will ultimately lead to the development of novel effective approaches to treat or prevent amyloid associated memory deficiency in patients with dementia."
"9345760","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT: Hypertension, or sustained systolic and diastolic blood pressure (BP) of 140 and 90 mm Hg or higher, is among the most frequently encountered conditions in primary care in the U.S. The estimated prevalence is 30% among all U.S. adults and increases with age to affect 65% of seniors. Hypertension is also the leading risk factor for cardiovascular disease, global mortality, and ranks third among the causes of disability. Treatment of hypertension is relatively straightforward, but patient adherence to long- term self-care strategies is problematically low. Three important behaviors that individuals can adhere to in order to help lower their BP are 1) Taking medications as prescribed by a physician, 2) Monitoring blood pressure at home, and 3) Limiting dietary sodium intake. Adherence to these behaviors is problematic and currently ranges from 25% to 50%; the current proposal is aimed at addressing the behavioral barriers for these three activities with the help of new technology. In particular, this STTR will develop and test an incentive program delivered through a telehealth app to increase adherence to prescribed BP control regimens, and precipitate reduction in BP. The target participants for the test are a vulnerable population of seniors with clinically diagnosed hypertension in the University of California - San Diego community. The product to be developed through this STTR is a telehealth app for patient smartphones, which incorporates financial and targeted incentives framed in a way that targets specific ?mental accounts? to maximize the behavioral effectiveness of the intervention. The approach is to (1) Using focus group to construct an optimal incentive strategy to promote adherence to overcome behavioral barriers, support self-efficacy, and complement intrinsic motivators, and (2) Demonstrate feasibility of combining behavioral economics with state-of-the-art telehealth technology to deliver an optimal incentive strategy to the specific group of patients to promote adherence and reduce BP. The telehealth innovation centers on (a) Immediate delivery of reminder triggers and reinforcement to establish behaviors, (b) Employment of computer vision and artificial intelligence technologies to reduce time and effort costs of adherence, and finally (c) Support for remote monitoring of patient progress by health plans, providers and researchers. Phase II will test the efficacy of this approach in a larger and more diverse population within the UCSD Health system, additionally incorporating incentives for outcomes (e.g., achievement of BP < 140/90 mm Hg) to search for statistically and clinically significant improvements in blood pressure resulting from use of the app with the optimal incentives. Initial customers are health insurers and risk-bearing hospital systems (e.g. those with value-based reimbursement models), who are fiscally responsible for large numbers of patients with poorly controlled BP."

"9471890","Abstract There is broad agreement that the cerebellum does more than just coordinate movement, with clear indications that it participates in a number of cognitive functions, and that its dysfunction may contribute to mental health disorders such as schizophrenia, autism, and addiction. Yet, compared to studies aimed at understanding the contribution of the cerebellum to motor coordination, there is little research focused on elucidating the non-motor functions of the cerebellum, and our understanding of its cognitive functions is rudimentary at best. The literature provides compelling evidence consistent with the idea that the cerebellum contributes to addiction and drug-seeking behavior both in experimental animals and in humans. However, the nature of this contribution has remained, by and large, unexplored. Our pilot data reveal a potential substrate for this effect: a previously little-appreciated direct projection from the cerebellum to the ventral tegmental area (VTA). Because the VTA is the seat of the mesolimbic dopamine projection that is critically important in addiction and reward, we propose the overarching hypothesis that the direct cerebellum to VTA projection (Cb?VTA) is a critical element of the neural circuitry underlying drug- seeking and natural reward-seeking behavior, as well as drug and natural reinforcement. A primary aim of the current proposal is to delineate, using state-of-the-art anatomical and physiological approaches, the pathways by which the cerebellum can affect the activity of neurons in the VTA, and also those in the prefrontal cortex and nucleus accumbens (two additional brain regions which are target of the VTA projections and are intimately associated with addictive behavior). To complement and expand upon the anatomical and physiological studies, an additional goal is to directly examine the potential utility of cerebellar projections to the VTA in acquisition and expression of addictive behavior using behavioral experiments during which the relevant cerebellar pathways are optogenetically or chemogenetically manipulated. Successful completion of the proposed aims would not only advance our understanding of the non- motor functions of the cerebellum, but has the potential to substantiate a number of mechanistic hypotheses on acquisition and extinction of addictive behaviors. Such knowledge, while fundamental basic science in nature, in the future may contribute to new insights for treatment of drug abusers and prevention of relapse after treatment."
"9448055","Abstract Low-intensity pulsed ultrasound stimulation (LIPUS) is a promising technology for non-invasive deep brain neuromodulation. Unfortunately, this technology is presently not available in the clinic due to the lack of understanding of the molecular and cellular processes that take place in brain cells upon ultrasound stimulation. The goal of this project is to uncover these mechanism(s). Our preliminary data show that LIPUS elicit robust and consistent calcium signals in astrocytes, suggesting a totally unanticipated mechanism wherein the neuromodulatory effects of LIPUS are mediated by astrocytes, via direct or indirect activation of calcium channels. To investigate these hypotheses, we propose to dissect LIPUS-induced calcium signaling in astrocytes and neurons using pharmacological agents. If successful, this work will help make this new technology available to patients who currently do not have access to effective and safe therapeutic options. Non-invasive astrocyte stimulation with ultrasound may also lead to new treatments for traumatic brain injury, neurovascular diseases or dementia. In parallel to this effort, we will develop genetically-encoded fluorescent reporters of mechanical deformations of plasma membranes induced upon LIPUS. Our preliminary molecular engineering design is very promising and will lead to a patent application upon further characterization and optimization. These sensors will enable rapid and easy localization and quantification of physical perturbations produced in cells and tissues by exogenous and endogenous mechanical forces. We expect these reporters to have a major impact in mechanobiology and nanotechnology."

"9446705","Project Summary/Abstract: Overall With the discovery of a number of new molecular targets and exponential increase in the number of anti-cancer agents, it has become imperative to optimize preclinical models in order to design rational clinical trials. Recognizing the unique advantage of the patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) models in drug testing and personalized medicine, physicians and researchers at Washington University School of Medicine (WUSM) and the Siteman Cancer Center have been actively generating and utilizing PDX models for cancer research and the evaluation of molecularly targeted agents. Building on our strength and existing infrastructure, we propose to establish the Washington University PDX Development and Trial Center (WU-PDTC), as part of PDXNet program, to promote preclinical testing in a collaborative nation-wide effort. The PDX core within WU-PDTC will develop and characterize at least 1000 new pathogen-free PDX models across major tumor types. The PDX models will be genomically and phenotypically characterized using the latest `omics technologies and expertly analyzed using the most current data analysis pipelines that have been deployed for other large scale NCI programs. The Bioinformatics Core will integrate these analyzes with clinical annotation from the originating patient to include patient treatment history and tumor response (Aim 1). Our two research projects will conduct PDX clinical trials using single agent and combinational agents using drugs under NCI-IND (Aim 2). Project 1 will test pan- or beta isoform specific class I PI3K inhibitors in over 100 breast PDX models while Project 2 will study combinatorial approaches that overcome tumor intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms to ERK inhibition in over 100 already available pancreatic PDX models. Proteogenomic and clinical response data will be collected in these models, as part of a broader effort of characterizing PDX models and conducting clinical correlation and treatment response analyses by the Bioinformatics Core (Aim 3). All relevant information, including proteogenomic features of PDX models and treatment/response history, will be tracked in a dedicated relational database that will be accessible to PDXNet and PDMR-FNLCR. The goal is to identify candidates for human clinical trials for the ET-CTN. In Aim 4, the WU-PDTC will leverage existing expertise and programs from the NCI-designated Comprehensive Siteman Cancer Center, Institute of Clinical and Translational Research (ITCS), McDonnell Genome Institute, Mallinkrodt Imaging Research Center, and Early Therapeutic Clinical Trials Network (ET-CTN) to support the goals of developing and utilizing PDX models to test and improve cancer treatment, in collaboration with other components of the PDXNet. Finally, WU-PDTC, through coordination by the Administration Core, will support pilot research projects utilizing the PDX resources and fostering collaboration across PDTCs, PNMR-FNLCR, and other NCI programs. The goal is to increase the spectrum of agents tested in PDX clinical trials and to improve the reliability, validation, utility, and standardization of PDX models through innovative Cross-PDXNet research. Our demonstrated capability in generating and utilizing PDX models, extensive existing infrastructure, and strong institutional commitment set a solid foundation for a successful PDTC that will help achieve goals set by NCI in advancing the use of PDX models in preclinical testing."
"9308424","This resubmission of application 1 R01 AG051723-01 seeks 5 years of funding to conduct a randomized con- trolled trial (RCT) to test the efficacy of a multi-component intervention called AgingPLUS. AgingPLUS targets neg- ative views on aging (NVOA), low control beliefs, and deficient goal-planning as a cluster of risk factors for un- healthy aging. Specifically, we will examine whether making adults' NVOA more positive and strengthening their personal control beliefs and goal planning will result in increases in physical activity (PA). PA is chosen as the outcome behavior of interest because it is the best non-pharmacological, non-invasive, and most cost-ef- fective method of health promotion. The proposed study addresses several issues of critical importance to indi- viduals and society at large. First, the project extends a large body of evidence showing that NVOA, low control beliefs, and poor goal-planning keep adults' from engaging in health-promoting behaviors, including engage- ment in PA. Second, the project also responds to calls for intervention programs that address attitudinal and motivational factors that undermine adults' ability to age in healthier ways. Finally, the project addresses critical issues with regard to the long-term maintenance of positive behavior change. The proposed project has three specific aims: 1. To conduct a randomized trial to examine the efficacy of the AgingPLUS program. Using a randomized single-masked pretest-posttest design with a social contact control group, we will examine if adults' NVOA,  personal control beliefs, and goal planning can be improved over the course of a 4-week intervention pro- gram. 2. To test a conceptual model of the mechanisms underlying the intervention effects. Because partici-  pants in the AgingPLUS group will practice a self-defined PA goal after they have completed the intervention,  we will use accelerometry and daily activity logs to assess their PA. Using a multiple mediator model, we  will examine if improved NVOA, control beliefs, and goal planning are the putative mechanisms that pro-  duced the change in PA. We hypothesize that improvements in NVOA, control beliefs, and goal planning  will be significant mediators of the association between the intervention and PA at the Week 8 posttest. 3. To conduct a 6-months follow-up to examine the long-term effects of AgingPLUS. We will conduct a 6-  month follow-up and use multilevel modeling to describe participants' change trajectories across all 4 times of assessment. In addition, we will examine if intermittent monitoring of participants' PA facilitates the maintenance of a physically active lifestyle. This aim examines the natural time course of the intervention effects to inform the next stage of development of the AgingPLUS program."
"9565790","Project summary/abstract Arterial calcification has increasingly been associated with poor outcomes in a wide variety of patient populations including those with coronary, aortic, and peripheral artery disease, as well as patients with diabetes, and renal failure. We previously demonstrated that calcification in peripheral arteries predicts major amputation even after adjusting for demographics, cardiovascular risk factors, and the ankle brachial index. During arterial calcification, medial smooth muscle cells (SMCs) undergo osteogenic transformation with loss of phenotype-specific markers and new expression of factors and signaling molecules most commonly found in developing bone. We and others have established a critical role for matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) in the progression of arterial calcification. MMPs are highly expressed in calcifying arteries, and we have demonstrated that reducing their activity with broad spectrum and synthetic inhibitors can prevent experimental calcification both in vitro and in vivo. In preliminary data for the current proposal, we show that MMP-3 (stromelysin-1) is the most strongly induced of all metalloproteinases in calcifying rodent aortas. Reducing MMP-3 activity decreases calcium accumulation in cultured human and rodent SMCs and in a rat aorta organ culture model. Aortas from MMP-3-deficient mice are protected from medial calcification in organ culture and in vivo. The location of MMP-3 activity required for calcification, whether local or systemic, and its contribution to SMC transformation is not currently known and this may act as a barrier to development of appropriate inhibitors for use in clinical trials. MMPs are primarily known for their ability to degrade extracellular matrix, yet recent evidence from a variety of cell types suggests an intracellular role for MMP-3 in phenotypic changes. Based on our data and those of others, we propose the overarching hypothesis that MMP-3, induced by inflammation and elevated phosphate levels, promotes osteogenic transformation of vascular SMCs and medial calcification through both local and systemic effects. We will begin to test this hypothesis by first defining the role of MMP-3 in phosphate-induced osteogenic transformation of vascular SMCs. We will next determine whether MMP-3 promotes medial calcification through systemic effects on circulating factors or through local actions within the arterial wall. Finally, we will evaluate whether doxycycline, an antibiotic with MMP inhibiting properties can slow the progression of arterial calcification in a clinical trial. As we progress through these aims we will answer critical questions about the role of MMPs in arterial calcification and the potential for a dedicated clinical trial to assess the role of MMP inhibition strategies to reduce calcification and improve outcomes in our patients with vascular disease."
"9555210","Project Summary: Stopping Bleeding in the Spinal Cord after Injury  There are approximately 250,000 people in the U.S. with spinal cord injury (SCI) and over 2 million worldwide. SCI leads to chronic functional deficits and significantly decreased quality of life. The human impact of the injury is enormous and the health care costs associated with the injury are the third highest in the U.S. to The impact of spinal cord injury is devastating to the patients, their families, and the health care system.  Spinal cord injury, though, is only one of a group of traumas to the central nervous system (CNS) that includes strokes and traumatic brain injuries. In all of these CNS injuries, hemorrhaging is one of the first steps that occurs in the injury process. This is followed by a secondary injury cascade that causes further damage and includes the influx of inflammatory cells and cytokines that exacerbate injury. We have intravenously administered hemostatic nanoparticles that stop internal bleeding including in the spinal cord after injury. We hypothesize that stopping the bleeding will reduce secondary injury progression, limit inflammation, protect tissue and improve function after spinal cord injury.  In this proposal, we will determine the optimal window of time for administering the hemostatic nanoparticles after injury to limit bleeding. We will determine the impact of limiting bleeding on the critical inflammatory cells after injury, particularly neutrophils and the polarization of macrophages to the M1 and M2 phenotypes since these have been shown to be highly altered by injury and most critical to the degenerative versus repair processes. We will then determine the short and long term impacts of limiting bleeding following spinal cord injury on the neural tissue preservation and functional recovery. Together this will give us the basis for a potential therapy as well as a mechanistic understanding of the role of bleeding following spinal cord injury. Ultimately, we will be able to combine this approach with drug therapies we are developing to improve outcomes following SCI.  Spinal cord injury is not only a devastating trauma, but it is an excellent model for investigating the role of controlling bleeding on inflammation, neural tissue preservation, and functional recovery. The knowledge we gain from this work will be applicable to the treatment of CNS injuries more broadly including traumatic brain injuries and hemorrhagic strokes.  The work proposed here will lead to a new approach to treating SCI and CNS injuries more broadly and has the potential to be a translatable technology that fundamentally alters patient outcomes."
"9539264","ABSTRACT Mercury (Hg) is a xenobiotic that is widespread in the environment. Hg is also a potent immunomodulator that has been implicated as a factor contributing to autoimmune disease in animal models and humans. A recent epidemiological study has now convincingly shown that in otherwise healthy individuals who were only exposed to low levels of mercury through typical environmental exposures, that there is a correlation between mercury blood levels and the appearance in the blood of antibodies to double stranded DNA. This indicates that under the proper circumstances exposure to environmental mercury promotes autoimmunity, a precursor to autoimmune disease. Since the discovery of B cells it has been appreciated by immunologists that in light of the Clonal Selection Theory, during the normal course of B cell development, large numbers of immature B cells must be generated that produce immunoglobulin reactive to many self- antigens (auto-antibodies). However, in the course of normal development, the vast majority of immature auto-reactive B cells are prevented from maturing by processes collectively known as tolerance. Autoimmune disease arises when these mechanisms of tolerance are disrupted. In B cells, it is firmly established that tolerance depends upon signals generated by the B Cell Receptor (BCR). Our preliminary experiments have shown that Hg interferes with signal generation by the BCR through mechanisms that may involve the tyrosine kinase Lyn, and the tyrosine phosphatases SHP-1 and CD45. It is our hypothesis that exposure to low, environmentally relevant levels of Hg, disrupts the development of tolerance in immature B cells by interfering with BCR signaling, leading to the appearance of mature auto-reactive B cells which have the potential to cause auto-immune disease. We propose to test this hypothesis through the utilization of anti-hen egg lysozyme (HEL)/hen egg lysozyme double transgenic mice. We also propose to expand upon our preliminary experiments in order to elucidate molecular mechanisms behind the ability of Hg to interfere with BCR signaling. We will utilize mouse strains with different, but well defined genetic susceptibilities to Hg intoxication, and employ complementary proteomic and multicolor phosphoflow cytometric approaches to directly investigate the ability of Hg to interfere with the function of Lyn, SHP-1 and CD45 during BCR signaling."
"9454946","Project Summary Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an immune-mediated disease of the central nervous system (CNS) and existing treatment options are only modestly effective for slowing eventual disease progression. The United States has approximately 500,000 cases of MS in adults and worldwide there are approximately 2.5 million cases of adult MS. This disease initially involves immune-mediated demyelination and transection of axons within the CNS, and later transitions into a neurodegenerative condition associated with insufficient neurotrophic support in the CNS. Cognitive and walking impairments are common in upwards of 60-80% of persons with MS, and are risk factors for unemployment, disability, and compromised quality of life. These issues underscore the importance of developing new therapy regimens to mitigate and reduce the severity of MS.  Immunotherapy through immunosuppressive agents has been the standard of care used to alleviate chronic relapse forms of MS. Many of these drugs work by sequestering lymphocytes to the lymph nodes, thereby reducing the number of circulating white blood cells resulting in fewer cells available to attack the nerve fibers. All of the available immunotherapy agents have side effects associated with the suppression of the immune system with the most critical including increased blood pressure, liver problems and death.  Based on the idea that a reduction of lymphocytes can alleviate symptoms of MS, we propose a novel therapeutic intervention for targeting lymphocytes residing in the cervical lymph nodes (CLNs) using focused ultrasound in the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) rat model of MS. Focused ultrasound allows hyperthermia to be targeted to specific tissues, i.e., the CLNs which primarily service the CNS, to degrade or kill lymphocytes residing in the CLNs. By killing or degrading the function of lymphocytes in the CLNs, we hypothesize that the severity of EAE will be alleviated. Our recent pilot study has provided first ever evidence that this approach results in remittance of EAE symptoms statistically significantly more than without therapy. However, our pilot study was on a limited number of animals with a single exposure condition. To further test our hypothesis and demonstrate the efficacy of this novel EAE therapy, a larger study is warranted to explore a range of therapy exposure conditions, larger animal numbers to detect smaller effects and analyses to elucidate mechanisms responsible for the therapy effects and quantify side effects.  To address these needs, two specific aims are proposed. The first specific aim is to explore a range of ultrasound therapy exposure conditions and quantify the effects of the exposure conditions on the therapy outcomes. The range of exposure conditions to be explored include: thermal dose, timing between treatments and EAE injection dose/treatment response. The second specific aim is to elucidate the effects of treatment on susceptibility to an upper-respiratory viral infection. We will quantify any reduction in immune response resulting as a side effect from our FUS therapy."
"9409550","Project Summary Keratoconus (KCN) is a progressive disorder associated with structural changes in corneal collagen organization that leads to corneal thinning and ruptures in Bowman?s layer and/or Descemet?s membrane. As the disease progresses, it leads to irregular astigmatism, progressive myopia, and subsequently poor visual acuity. Treatment options are surprisingly limited with no oral or topical pharmaceutical therapy. Most mild KCN can be corrected with glasses or soft contact lenses but very often patients will need toric or hard contacts as the disease progresses. Ultimately, 1 in 5 patients will require surgery. Our technology is based on a co-factor for lysyl oxidase (LOX activity) and that low LOX activity in the cornea has been linked to the development of keratoconus both genetically and biochemically. We provide the evidence in preliminary results of a new topical eye drop effect on human keratoconus corneas in increasing both LOX activity and cornea stiffening. We also show the first morphological evidence of induced central corneal flattening in rabbits with optical coherence tomography (OCT). Based on the current evidence base, we outline new proactive pathways for keratoconus management and enabling a non-invasive and relatively cost effective treatment for keratoconus. We propose a research plan under three specific aims that will a) study the safety and tolerability of the eye drops in rabbits in vivo, b) study the effect of dosing frequency on rabbit corneal shape and biochemical crosslinking in vivo and c) to determine whether the eye drops induce biochemical crosslinking on human keratoconic corneas ex vivo."
"9402373","Project Summary This application from the Mount Sinai Health System proposes participation as a genetic research center (GRC) within the NIDDK Inflammatory Bowel Disease Genetics Consortium (IBDGC). IBD genetic discovery has disproportionately focused on European ancestry cohorts, despite high and rising prevalence in all US populations. In Aim 1, participation as a multi- disciplinary GRC in Consortium-wide projects is proposed. Expanding sequence and genotype data on non-European ancestry cohorts is proposed. New analytic methodologies have been developed whereby more ancestrally complex populations, such as Hispanic cohorts, can not only be meaningfully analyzed, but may confer substantial benefits in unlocking the overall genetic architecture of polygenic diseases, such as IBD. The application of novel clinical research tools involving efficient electronic health record and development of more objective endpoints can deepen longitudinal phenotype data for already recruited patients. Given the continued centrality of anti-TNF therapies in an era of multiple new therapies, studies to examine anti-TNF non-response (ileal resection, surgical specimens) and response (new anti- TNF initiation, endoscopically-based) are proposed. Specifically, in Aim 2, definition of intestinal single-cell expression features with anti-TNF non-response and response is proposed using mass cytometry protein analyses (Cytof), and single cell mRNA sequencing. Single cell analyses in IBD tissues shows enormous promise in systematically explicating the precise contributions in the most relevant context of the over 200 genome-wide significant IBD associations. Early single cell analyses points to a highly complex innate immune cell architecture, which may be distinct between various high effect IBD-associated risk alleles of innate immunity. Scaling key results through correlative techniques feasible in larger cohorts, such as using paraffin-embedded tissues and peripheral blood samples is proposed. The advent of multiple new therapies makes this a particularly propitious time to protocolize clinical practice, both to improve patient care, as well as to mine biosamples for IBD research. The insight that is gained through these studies can prioritize genes, cells and pathways from which to scale key results and protocols across the NIDDK IBDGC. The long-term goal of these studies is to efficiently develop protocols to most effectively treat IBD patients, catalyzing the advent of Precision IBD."
"9348611","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Antibiotic-resistant bacteria are associated with considerable morbidity, mortality, and costs. Infection rates with antibiotic-resistant Gram-negative bacteria continue to increase. As was recently outlined in President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology (PCAST) report on antibiotic resistance, novel interventions are needed to curb the spread of antibiotic-resistant bacteria including carbapenem-resistant Gram-negative bacteria. Through an AHRQ contract, we performed a 20 ICU cluster randomized trial (BUGG study) to determine if wearing gloves and gowns for all patient contact reduced VRE and MRSA acquisition compared to the usual standard of care; the results were published in JAMA. The study showed a 40% decrease in MRSA acquisition but no effect on VRE acquisition. The differing results for MRSA and VRE led many intensivists, infectious disease physicians, hospital epidemiologists, and hospital administrators to be uncertain about whether to implement the intervention of universal glove and gown in their ICU. The original peri-anal cultures from the BUGG study were stored so that they could be analyzed in the future for other bacteria including carbapenem-resistant Gram- negative bacteria. What is not known that this application will address is whether wearing gloves and gowns for all patient contact in the ICU leads to a decrease in antibiotic-resistant Gram- negative bacteria. The overall objective of this application is to determine whether wearing gloves and gowns for all patient contact leads to a decrease in the acquisition of carbapenem- resistant Gram-negative bacteria. Our central hypothesis is that the intervention will be effective at decreasing the acquisition of carbapenem-resistant Gram-negative bacteria. The rationale for this application is that the BUGG study left an important question unanswered: What is the effect of universal glove and gown on carbapenem-resistant Gram-negative bacteria? The aim of this study is to use already collected peri-anal specimens to assess whether wearing gloves and gowns decreases the acquisition of carbapenem-resistant Gram-negative bacteria. The significance of the proposed research is that it will determine whether wearing gloves and gowns for all patient contact in the ICU setting will lead to a decrease in the acquisition of carbapenem-resistant Gram-negative bacteria. This application, if funded, has an exceedingly high probability of success because the proposed secondary analysis is based on an already completed randomized cluster trial. All of the specimens have been obtained and can be worked up in a very cost-effective manner. This allows AHRQ to answer an important question without funding from scratch a new randomized cluster trial."
"9360557","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this application is to determine if the administration of nebulized albuterol during exercise can improve the delivery and physiological responses of albuterol, a bronchodilator, in individuals with cystic fibrosis (CF). This project wil provide excellent intellectual and robust technical training opportunities to support the applicant  in achieving her goal of becoming an independent investigator studying translational cardiopulmonary physiology. Specific Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that the degree of bronchodilation will be greatest when exercise and albuterol are combined in healthy individuals and in those with CF, compared to albuterol or exercise alone. We will assess bronchodilation [change in forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1), and forced expiratory flow for 25-75% of the forced vital capacity (FEF25-75)] in response to three treatments: 1) exercise, 2) nebulized albuterol administration, and 3) exercise combined with albuterol administration. In Specific Aim 2, we will test the hypothesis that the duration of bronchodilation will be lowest after exercise, and will significantly increase when exercise is combined with albuterol. We will assess bronchodilation for 6 hours after each treatment and will accept our hypothesis if albuterol administration during moderate aerobic exercise has the largest area under the curve for bronchodilation (FEV1 and FEF25-75) over 6 hours. Specific Aim 3 will test the hypothesis that giving nebulized albuterol during exercise will improve drug delivery. We will measure plasma albuterol concentrations for 6 hours in response to each of the three conditions and run pharmacokinetic analyses. We predict that the delivery of nebulized albuterol during exercise will have an improved pharmacokinetic profile (maximum concentration and area under the curve) as compared to standard nebulized albuterol therapy. Administration of an inhaled bronchodilator during exercise may lead to better delivery and distribution of the drug, which could augment or prolong the bronchodilatory and pharmacokinetic effect of exercise or albuterol alone. This study will serve as proof of concept that combining exercise with aerosolized drug administration can improve drug delivery, which would be beneficial for other inhaled therapies in CF. In addition, regular delivery of albuterol during exercise would replace a  daily sedentary activity with an active one, which could help CF patients reap the many benefits of regular exercise by allowing two therapies (exercise and inhaled medications) to be utilized at the same time while potentially receiving synergistic treatment effects. We propose a novel, high-impact, and translational study investigating the pharmacokinetic and bronchodilatory effects of delivering nebulized albuterol during exercise. The research team, combined with the extensive resources at the Mayo Clinic, provides the optimal training environment to complete studies in this area."
"9467787","ABSTRACT Vesicle trafficking is an essential process in all eukaryotic cells. Conserved protein complexes known as membrane tethering factors are required for vesicle fusion, and multiple models have been proposed for their mechanism of action: recruitment and tethering of vesicles at the target membrane, removal of the vesicle coat, and/or chaperoning the assembly of membrane fusogenic SNARE proteins. The simplest and best- characterized tethering factor, Dsl1, has been proposed to perform all of these functions. I intend to test this hypothesis by structurally characterizing Dsl1 in complex with SNAREs and vesicle coat subunits. I will also develop a novel assay to visualize the tethering of coated vesicles in the cell. These results will allow me to better define the molecular mechanism of Dsl1 action and will lead to a more thorough understanding of how tethering factors, coats, and SNAREs work together to regulate vesicle fusion. My proposed work will also form the basis for a better understanding of coat and tethering factor dysfunction, which has been implicated in both heritable diseases, such as congenital autoimmune disorders and spinal muscular atrophy, and sporadic diseases including Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease."
"9405823","Project Summary Visionize has developed a sophisticated wearable state of the art low vision aid by reprogramming a readily available low cost off the shelf Virtual Reality system. The device operates in three main modes: 1) The patient views the real world with adjustable magnification power and area within the overall scene. 2) The patient also has access to the full complement of digital media ranging from digital news and email to digital streaming media like Netflix and you tube. 3) The clinician has diagnostic capability via remote access to patient display and responses. The device is built from the Samsung Galaxy S7 phone, one of the most advanced on the market, inserted into a Samsung Gear VR headset. On the phone display the low vision user sees an enhanced version of the visual world tuned to specific visual deficit. The goal of this project is to refine the function of the device to a level where it can be successfully deployed to a population of test patients at the Johns Hopkins low vision clinic. Then the device will be further refined and enhanced through feedback from the patient population. The end goal is to develop a low vision aid with superior performance that can be distributed to a large low vision population worldwide at an affordable price."
"9352766","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Patients commonly present to the Emergency Department with suspected kidney stone - broadly defined as acute, coliky flank pain radiating to the groin. Patients diagnosed with kidney stones represent 1% of ED visits, accounting for more than one million visits per year. One concerning trend in the evaluation of patients with kidney stones is the increasing utilization of CT scan despite a lack of studies comparing its effectiveness to older, more traditional methods of diagnosis with respect to patient outcomes. In fact, despite a 10-fold increase in CT scan utilization over the years of 1997-2006, there was no change in the rates of diagnosis of kidney stone, serious alternate diagnoses, or hospital admission for kidney stone. On the other hand, there is evidence that CT scans are associated with radiation exposure and increased cost. I propose to derive and validate a decision instrument to identify patients with suspected kidney stone. This decision instrument has the potential to allow emergency physicians to identify patients with suspected kidney stones at very low risk for a serious outcome (alternate diagnoses or complications requiring admission and or surgical intervention), in whom advanced imaging with CT can be deferred. A second concern is the uncertainty regarding the efficacy of medical expulsive therapy for patients with kidney stones. Despite evidence that medical expulsive therapy increases the rate of stone passage in patients diagnosed with kidney stones, a survey of national data from 2006 shows that only 4% of emergency patients receive this therapy. The objectives of this application are two-fold: 1) to improve the diagnostic strategy in patients with suspected kidney stone and 2) to improve the treatment for patients with kidney stones. Aim 1 now focuses on the development of a decision instrument for patients with suspected kidney stone using the rich clinical data already collected as part of the STONE trial. Aim 2 seeks to examine the utilization and outcomes associated with medical expulsive therapy in the STONE trial. We propose to perform an observational study comparing the outcomes including morbidity, health care utilization, and cost in the cohort of patients receiving medical expulsive therapy to the cohort of patients not receiving it. Furthermore, we propose to describe the variation and trends in the utilization of medical expulsive therapy. I anticipate positive impacts in the management of patients with suspected kidney stones after completing these aims. If Aim 1 produces a useful decision instrument, future research could be conducted to broadly validate and determine the impact of these rules and ultimately decrease CT utilization. If Aim 2 confirms the efficacy of MET, I would design implementation studies to translate this finding into clinical care. The experience and training I will derive from completing these aims can then be applied to other emergency department complaints to improve decision making, decrease testing and accelerate the adoption of proven therapies."
"9380667","Chronic, low level indoor pesticide exposures are associated with adverse health outcomes in children, including cancer and cognitive, neurological, and respiratory problems. Recent studies show that pesticides applied as sprays are used in child care facilities exposing young children and staff to harmful chemicals. Thirteen million children in the United States and one million children in California under six years of age attend child care programs. Compared with adults, young children are more vulnerable to pesticides since their developing organs and bodily systems can be damaged during critical windows of development. Interventions to reduce pesticide exposure in child care centers have focused on teaching child care staff about integrated pest management (IPM) and providing hands-on technical assistance and follow-up consultation. IPM is an approach to managing pests that focuses on preventing infestations, monitoring for pests, and limiting the use of harmful pesticides. Pesticides are used as a last resort and primarily as self-contained baits, which do not contaminate indoor environments. IPM intervention programs led by nurses trained as child care health consultants have shown positive changes in staff knowledge, policies, and practices; however, these studies did not include control groups or assess whether the intervention reduced pesticide exposures to the children. The goal of this study is to reduce children?s exposure to pesticides in child care centers to improve their long- term health. A randomized-control trial in four northern California counties will compare changes in pesticide exposure among child care centers assigned to an IPM intervention versus an attention control intervention on physical activity. One hundred child care centers serving socio-economically and ethnically diverse preschool- age children will be enrolled. This study will be modeled on a successful nurse-led child care health consultation intervention comprised of an educational workshop, materials and tools, and center-specific consultation over seven months. In addition, the study will include novel methods of measuring pesticide concentrations in child care centers (dust) and to individual children in the child care settings (silicone wristbands). The study aims are to determine if a nurse-led IPM intervention (1) increases child care center staff?s IPM knowledge, (2) improves center?s IPM policies and practices, (3) reduces pest problems (i.e., pests present, pest residue), (4) increases director?s self-efficacy, (5) reduces pesticide exposures in child care center environments, and (6) reduces child-level pesticide exposures in the intervention child care centers compared to the control centers. This study contributes to public health goals set by Healthy People 2020 to improve environmental health through educational and community-based programs and will inform state and national programs promoting environmental health policy changes in child care. Improving children?s physical environment and reducing harmful exposures to pesticides will support young children?s growth and development so they are healthy and ready to learn as they enter kindergarten."
"9299508","Olive-derived oleocanthal as a novel natural product molecule to restore cerebrovascular function and  integrity in a CAA mouse model Project Summary Cerebral vascular dysfunction plays a critical role in the pathology of cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) and is often observed in Alzheimer?s disease (AD). Therapeutics that target the blood-brain barrier (BBB) may be beneficial in multiple neurodegenerative disorders including AD, CAA, and vascular dementia. Studies from our laboratory demonstrated oleocanthal, a natural phenolic compound isolated from extra-virgin olive oil, as a novel molecule with neuroprotective effects against CAA and AD in mouse models. In addition, new preliminary data obtained from our recently developed unique in vitro BBB model with CAA characteristics showed oleocanthal to rectify the compromised integrity and function of this CAA-BBB model. The overall goal of this project is to tie findings obtained from our pre-clinical in vivo studies and from the novel in vitro BBB model with cutting edge in vivo imaging tools focus on studying the BBB function and with behavioral studies to determine oleocanthal as a promising therapeutic for vascular A? pathogenesis disorders like CAA and AD. Our central hypothesis is that oleocanthal is a novel therapeutic molecule that targets the BBB for prevention and/or treatment of vascular A? pathogenesis. We will test this hypothesis by pursuing the following specific aims: Aim 1) Investigate the in vivo efficacy of orally administered oleocanthal to improve cerebral blood flow and BBB integrity, reduce synaptotoxicity, and improve learning and memory deficits in transgenic mouse model of CAA/AD. This Aim will be examined via the Sub-Aims: a) determine functional effects of oleocanthal treatment using a battery of cognitive tasks, b) investigate oleocanthal effect on cerebral blood flow and BBB permeability and functionality using the new state-of-the art system Multi-Spectral Optoacoustic Tomography (MSOT), and c) evaluate oleocanthal effect on vascular and cerebral A? load, synaptic integrity and neurogenesis. Aim 2) Determine the pharmacokinetics and brain distribution of orally administered oleocanthal in wild type mice. A multidisciplinary team of investigators with expertise in neurologic disorders, behavioral testing, molecular imaging and pre-clinical drug development for AD therapeutics are committed to the project. Outcomes of this work will support and advance therapeutic development of oleocanthal toward clinical trials."
"9340014","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Today, patients and providers are presented with more health care options than ever before. There is considerable doubt and lack of understanding of science not only among patients, but also among physicians. Without systematic, evidence-based guidance for the appropriate and efficient use of the multitude of treatment options, as well as the consideration of patient preferences, the rapid growth and complexity of treatments will only add to the existing confusion about which option is best for each individual patient.        The objective of the proposed Patient-Centered Outcome Research Center (PCORC) is to fully leverage and further develop the research Infrastructure and clinical assets of Henry Ford Health System (HFHS) in order to conduct Patient-Centered Outcomes Research (PCOR). The PCOR evidence will guide care in order to achieve patient-desired outcomes in our urban and suburban patient populations located throughout Metropolitan Detroit. The Center will be organized into four different Cores (Patient Engagement Core, Study Design and Analysis/Measurement Core, Patient Data Network Core, and Implementation/Dissemination Core) with different functions. The Center currently has three PCOR projects proposed that are focused on our selected theme of caring for the obese patient. The HFHS PCORC will maximize programmatic and scientific efficiency within our health care system setting, promote shared use of resources and standardization of processes and procedures, promote training in PCOR/Comparative Effectiveness Research (CER) methods, and facilitate rapid dissemination of research findings to the medical community and translation of those results into our system's clinical practice.        The Center will bliild on existing research capabilities by developing expertise in novel PCOR methods    through didactic course work, educational sessions at national meetings and content-specific educational seminars. These educational experiences will allow the Center staff to learn how to develop and conduct innovative PCOR studies that will provide evidence for the many pressing issues in patient care. The Center wiil demonstrate its proficiency through the conduct of the proposed proiects."
"9239794","PROJECT SUMMARY Craniofacial microsomia (CFM) is a common congenital condition (1:3,500) that affects the facial skeleton, ears, and facial nerve among other facial and extracranial malformations. As a result, children with CFM frequently require multiple interventions to restore their airway, feeding, hearing, and facial symmetry. The lifelong health care needs associated with CFM substantially impact families, the health care system, and society. The genetic risk factors for this condition remain largely unknown and large multi-center studies addressing this fundamental gap in knowledge have not yet been conducted. In this application, we propose to study the genetic etiology of CFM. Our long term objective is to identify the genetic and non-genetic risk factors that contribute to CFM and evaluate the affected genetic pathways. We have identified 18 candidate genes for CFM in our study of 29 trios (affected individual with CFM and non-affected parents). Based on our preliminary findings and using the FACIAL network, an established network funded by the NIH specifically designed to study CFM, we propose to conduct the following studies: Aim 1) define genes and gene pathways whose expression is disrupted in the developing facial tissue that contributes to the CFM phenotype; Aim 2) identify new candidate genes for CFM by using whole genome sequencing in 170 trios from banked samples (n=70) and prospective enrollment (n=100); and Aim 3) detect mutations in 50 candidate genes identified in our previous genetic studies in CFM and in Aims 1 and 2 using targeted capture sequencing on samples from 490 individuals with CFM. The combination of deep high throughput sequencing and gene expression studies in relevant tissues from human and animal models will facilitate the identification of meaningful genetic causes for this disorder. Our multidisciplinary FACIAL network has the infrastructure to investigate the genetic complexity in CFM. Including both national and international sites, which have a higher prevalence of CFM, the FACIAL network has the ability to collect high-quality data on a large (n=660) and well-characterized population. We expect that our proposed studies will identify genes that cause CFM and generate insights into the pathways that regulate craniofacial development, thus providing useful information for the study of CFM and other craniofacial disorders. This research will positively impact health care for this population by identifying options for molecular diagnosis, precise family and reproductive counseling, and for tailored clinical management and primary prevention strategies for high-risk populations. This is of highest relevance to the NIDCR mission to improve craniofacial health through research."
"9458065","ABSTRACT Synthetic cathinones are novel psychoactive substances used for their euphorigenic and psychostimulant properties, but carry a significant risk of inducing adverse psychiatric complications, systemic toxicity, and patterns of abuse and dependence. We recently demonstrated that the synthetic cathinone 3,4- methylenedioxypyrovalerone (MDPV), a potent and long-lasting monoamine reuptake inhibitor, is readily self- administered by rodents under limited access conditions. However, synthetic cathinone users frequently engage in repeated binge-like patterns of drug intake across several consecutive days, which have not yet been modeled in rodents to determine potential detrimental effects on cognition and brain function. To address this, we recently conducted preliminary studies in which rats were allowed to self-administer MDPV or saline for 96 consecutive hrs (4 days), followed by 72 hrs (3 days) of abstinence in the home cage. This procedure was repeated to allow for a total of 5 weeks of prolonged drug self-administration alternating with periods of abstinence. Next, animals underwent assessment of cognitive function using object placement and recognition tasks, followed by analysis of brain tissue for potential evidence of neurodegeneration, neuroinflammation, or oxidative stress. Animals self- administering MDPV displayed high levels of drug intake (>100 mg/kg per 96-hr session), and compared to animals self-administering saline, showed performance deficits in object recognition but not object placement. We also observed evidence of MDPV-induced neurodegeneration, neuroinflammation, and oxidative stress in the recognition memory circuit. However, additional studies are needed to further examine the dose and sex- dependency of these effects, whether they extend to measures of cognitive flexibility, and to investigate potential underlying mechanisms and approaches for mitigating these effects. The overarching hypothesis of the studies proposed in this application is that MDPV-induced neurocognitive dysfunction is highly influenced by sex, dose, and neuroinflammatory mechanisms. To test this hypothesis, we propose three independent yet inter-related aims. In Specific Aim 1, we will examine the influence of sex and dose on MDPV-induced neurocognitive dysfunction. In Specific Aim 2, we will examine the effects of repeated binge-like MDPV intake on cognitive flexibility. Finally, in Specific Aim 3, we will pharmacologically investigate potential mechanisms (neuroinflammation or oxidative stress) underlying MDPV-induced neurocognitive dysfunction. Together, these studies will assist in the development of therapeutic interventions to counteract the detrimental effects of synthetic cathinones on cognition and brain function."
"9353314","Project Summary  Lack of consensus regarding the optimal treatment approach for men with low-risk prostate cancer has resulted in significant variation in practice patterns (Cooperberg et al. 2010). In recent years, a high and increasing proportion of men with low-risk prostate cancer have received aggressive treatment, including intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) and prostatectomy performed using the daVinci robot (Jacobs et al. 2013). This trend is concerning because IMRT and robotic surgery are both substantially more expensive than the older technologies they have replaced?start-up costs for each of these advanced technologies hovers around $2 million (Barbash and Glied 2010; Carreyrou and Tamman 2010)?but the new technologies offer no additional benefit in terms of survival for low-risk disease (NCCN 2011, Nguyen et al. 2011).  Moreover, the greater use of aggressive treatment for men with low-risk prostate cancer has occurred despite evidence suggesting that more conservative monitoring approaches may be more appropriate for patients with indolent disease. Recent findings from randomized trials of aggressive (radical prostatectomy) compared to conservative (watchful waiting) modalities do not contradict recommendations for conservative treatment of low risk disease (e.g., Bill-Axelson et al 2011; Wilt et al 2012). Several observational studies find low mortality rates among men with well-differentiated disease treated conservatively (Albertson et al. 2005; Klotz et al 2010; Lu-Yao et al 2009). However, these observational studies do not control for patient selection into conservative treatment, despite evidence that patient selection into treatment is significant for clinically localized cancer (Harlan et al 2001). Moreover, previous observational studies have not controlled for physician characteristics, including compensation structure that may affect treatment modality. Previous research has also not fully assessed the consequences of aggressive versus conservative treatment of low- risk prostate cancer for outcomes beyond mortality, including side effects and episode treatment costs.  Our proposed research addresses these significant gaps in knowledge using a sample of men age 65 and older with newly diagnosed low-risk prostate cancer during the time period 2005-2014. Our data includes Medicare claims records merged with state cancer registry data from California, Florida, New Jersey, and Texas. Our aims are as follows: Aim 1: To evaluate whether and how provider attributes affect type of treatment received after controlling for clinical factors and patient characteristics. Aim 2: To evaluate whether receipt of aggressive treatment compared to conservative management affects the probability of experiencing adverse health outcomes including death and complications from treatment. Aim 3: To evaluate whether receipt of aggressive treatment compared to conservative management affects cancer-related episode expenditures."
"9238228","Fuchs corneal dystrophy (FCD) is a degenerative disorder of the corneal endothelium that affects nearly 4% of the population above 40 years of age and accounts for the majority of transplants performed each year in the US. Despite the health and socioeconomic impact of the disorder, knowledge of the underlying mechanism and genetic load is sparse, with the only available treatment being corneal transplant surgery. In this competing renewal, we will extend our previous clinical and genetic studies to a) expand our understanding of the clinical presentation and progression of FCD; b) identify its underlying genetic causes; and c) begin developing in vitro and in vivo models for FCD mutations. Our work consists of three specific aims that draw from the strengths of an interdisciplinary team. First, we will expand our patient collection and quantitatively document progression in families linked to known FCD loci (including two novel loci uncovered by our group in the past year), and investigate hearing loss as a new potential endophenotype of FCD. Second, taking advantage of our unique cohort, which is enriched for large, multigenerational families, we will identify novel genes for FCD using a combination of traditional genetics tools and exon capture coupled to next generation re- sequencing. Finally, we will take advantage of the knock-in mouse model developed recently in our laboratory to understand the cellular basis of familial loss of function mutations in TCF8 in late-onset FCD families. These three aims represent a balance of valuable clinical and genetic analyses coupled with functional experiments designed to dissect the molecular components essential to corneal endothelial biology and understand biochemical and cellular mechanisms underlying the disease pathology. Completion of these studies will significantly enhance our understanding of the genetic basis of this common disorder, offer important new insights into its pathomechanism, and provide critical measures for establishing disease presentation and progression rates, which will be necessary for patient management and for the design of novel therapeutic paradigms."
"9389764","Project Summary/Abstract Diabetic retinopathy (DR) remains the first cause of blindness in the working age population and the increasing number of diabetic cases only promises further increase in the healthcare burden associated. Anti-VEGF is a powerful new treatment option for proliferative diabetic retinopathy and macular edema, late stages of DR; however there are still no therapies available to prevent early alterations of the neuroretina. aA- and aB-crystallins are chaperone proteins promoting cell survival in acute stress conditions, which have been proposed as promising therapeutic targets for neurodegenerative conditions. The molecular chaperone aA-crystallin is highly upregulated in the retina during diabetes and while we showed that its phosphorylation on S148 (rodent) or T148 (human) residue is critical for its protective role, there is a fundamental gap in our knowledge regarding the molecular mechanisms by which it promotes the survival of retinal cells and how those mechanisms are regulated by this phosphorylation. The long-term goal of this research is to determine how the chaperone functions of ?-crystallins can be manipulated to preserve vision in patients with diabetes. The objective of this project is to identify the molecular mechanisms by which the function of ?A-crystallin protein is modulated in retinal neurons and glia in diabetes. Emerging from our preliminary data and previously published work, the central hypothesis guiding this project is that aA-crystallin promotes neuronal survival via both cell autonomous and non-autonomous mechanisms regulated by the phosphorylation of the S148/T148 residue. The rationale for the proposed research is that determining the cellular function of aA-crystallin in the neuro-glial unit will lead to strategies to enhance retinal cell viability in chronic retinal diseases such as diabetic retinopathy. This hypothesis will be tested by pursuing 3 specific aims: i) Determine the molecular mechanisms by which pS148/pT148 controls the protective function of aA-crystallin in retinal neurons; ii) Determine the function of aA-crystallin in Müller glia; and iii) Determine the kinase and phosphatases regulating phosphorylation of aA-crystallin on S148/T148. Under the first 2 aims, we will establish how aA-crystallin and its phosphorylation regulate the balance of apoptotic and survival signaling pathways in retinal neurons in vitro, while human tissues will be used to confirm their relevance, and AAV-based constructs in animal models will allow to test their potential in vivo. While aim 1 will focus on the cell autonomous mechanisms in retinal neurons themselves, aim 2 will focus on the non-cell autonomous mechanisms involving Müller glia. Finally aim 3 will use in vitro screening followed by in vivo validation to identify the kinase and how it is affected by diabetes. This research project will reveal the multifaceted and critical regulatory functions played by aA-crystallin in the retina, potentially leading to the identification of approaches for utilizing this intrinsic protective pathway to promote retinal cell survival in chronic neurodegenerative conditions and, thereby, preserve visual function."
"9330798","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): While existing teen pregnancy prevention efforts have contributed to significant declines in the overall U.S. teen pregnancy rate, teen pregnancy prevention programs specifically targeting adolescent males are limited and sorely needed. The primary aim of the proposed research is to further develop, evaluate, and disseminate a teen pregnancy prevention program specifically designed for adolescent males to enhance the current scientific evidence and intervention options available for broad public health scale up. Specifically, the intervention entitled, Fathers Raising Responsible Men (FRRM) is designed to facilitate important paternal parenting behaviors that influence adolescent decision-making. The proposed research focuses on the adolescent male component of teen pregnancy by identifying and addressing adolescent risk and paternal protective behaviors specific to adolescent males that have not been fully addressed in previous prevention efforts. FRRM incorporates a novel, theoretically-based intervention highlighting the important and influential role that fathers have on the development of adolescent males. This study strives to reduce adolescent male sexual risk behavior through targeting Black and Latino adolescent males aged 15-19 and their fathers residing in the South Bronx in three phases. Phase I is a pilot study consisting of 50 families to test and refine the intervention and technical and training assistance needs. Phase II is the RCT comprised of 800 families to rigorously evaluate the intervention. Finally, Phase III will conduct an implementation science study incorporating successful RCT participants in order to refine any intervention and training materials to increase the scalability and dissemination of FRRM and the study results. These three phases allow for the successful implementation and evaluation of FRRM in conjunction with the refinement and provision of all training and technical assistance necessary for the intervention. If successful, the proposed project will further develop the current scientific evidence and intervention options targeted specifically to the teen pregnancy prevention needs of ethnic minority adolescent males."
"9444669","Virus infection induces a wide range of host defense mechanisms, such as the innate immune response and inflammation. Some viruses express accessory proteins to induce general shutoff of host protein synthesis, which is considered to be one of the major viral strategies to counteract host antiviral activity and immune response. Influenza A virus is one of these viruses and expresses two proteins NS1 and PA-X to induce host shutoff. PA-X is a novel protein found to be expressed from PA mRNA by ribosomal frameshifting. PA-X is composed of an endonuclease domain of PA with a unique C-terminal region. Recent studies including ours indicate that mRNA degradation is the major strategy for host shutoff. The PA-X is more active in shutoff activity than NS-1, and it contains multiple regions involved in specific mRNA degradation. Characterization of a mutant 2009 pandemic H1N1 virus expressing reduced amount of PA-X indicates that PA-X plays a significant role in antagonizing host innate and acquired immune responses. The mechanism of how PA-X induces shutoff is not known. However, a recent study showed that PA-X selectively degrades host RNA polymerase II transcripts, and that pre- mRNAs under 3?-processing are susceptible for PA-X degradation. We also found that PA-X localizes and degrades mRNAs in both the nucleus and cytoplasm, suggesting that PA-X has multiple strategies to capture and degrade pre-mRNAs and mature mRNAs in cells. This project will reveal the mechanism of how PA-X targets and degrades host pre-mRNA in the nucleus (Aim 1), and mature mRNAs in the cytoplasm (Aim 2). Using viruses having various shutoff activities, we will determine the functional interaction between PA-X and NS1 to unveil how IAV adjusts the level of shutoff to create optimum condition for viral replication. Because the shutoff activity directly affects host immune responses, we will test a hypothesis that efficacy of live attenuated vaccine can be improved by suppressing shutoff activity. Overall, the proposed study will provide a foundation for understanding 1) the mechanism by which influenza viruses modulate host gene expression, 2) the mechanism by which viral gene expression is optimized, and 3) the impact of PA-X on viral pathogenicity and host immune response. Upon completion of these studies, we will learn the unique multiple strategy of PA-X in inducing host shutoff in infected cells, and its impact on viral pathogenicity and immune evasion."
"9384653","Project Summary/Abstract The complement system is critical for rapid detection and clearance of pathogens and immune complexes. Distinction between self and nonself is conferred by regulator proteins, which downregulate complement activation on host cells. Complement dysregulation is involved in several inflammatory conditions, including age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Deficiencies or mutations in specific complement proteins are linked to increased risk of developing AMD, and complement-targeted therapeutics have shown promise in treating AMD. In addition, it is critical to be able to monitor the onset and progression of AMD, as aberrant complement activation occurs on the retinal pigmented epithelium (RPE) in AMD patients. Complement proteins and regulators are constituents of drusen, including the terminal product C3d that remains covalently attached on surfaces on which complement has been activated. Our goal is to develop low-molecular mass chemical compounds and peptides that have strong binding affinities for C3d and fluorescence properties. These molecules will have potential as quantifiable biomarkers of complement activation in the eye and as diagnostics for early stage AMD. Our methods are computational and experimental. We will use pharmacophore-based virtual high-throughput screening, and protein-ligand docking to discover small chemical compounds with predicted binding affinities for C3d and intrinsic fluorescence. We will also use peptide design principles to design peptides with attached clinically-approved fluorophores that have predicted binding affinities for C3d. Both approaches are based on the interactions of C3d with its receptor, complement receptor 2 (CR2), and complement regulator Factor H (FH), using crystallographic structures and molecular dynamics simulations. We will test our computationally predicted C3d ligands, using an in vitro direct binding, biochemical and functional assays, and we will examine their photophysical properties using fluorescence spectroscopy. We will then evaluate the efficacies of the C3d ligands with highest potency and optimal fluorescence properties in human retinal pigmented epithelial cell-based assays. Finally, we will test the most efficacious ligands in histological sections of drusen-laden retinal tissues from non-human primate models of AMD, as well as using retinal sections from human AMD eyes. The proposed studies will generate data for a more focused study to evaluate a lead compound in animal models. !"
"9245134","PROJECT DESCRIPTION The prevalence of Alzheimer?s Disease (AD) is expected to increase significantly in the next 30 years. While research efforts continue to focus on the causes of AD and to develop effective medical treatments, there is also a pressing need to characterize risk for AD before the disease is diagnosed. There may be subtle changes in brain and cognitive function that are detectable before major symptoms emerge. One approach for characterizing these vulnerabilities is the use of functional and structural neuroimaging to identify risk profiles for AD. The present study proposes and tests a model of AD pathology using neuroimaging network analysis and machine learning approaches to provide insight on widespread changes in information processing in the AD brain. The proposed model hypothesizes that some aspects of network information processing reflect neurodegeneration and cognitive decline associated with AD pathology (e.g., hub connectivity and global connectivity) whereas other network properties reflect attempts to compensate for compromised information processing (e.g., diffusion of information). In addition, this proposal compares the efficacy of models with respect to discriminating diagnostic categories (e.g., machine learning classification of AD and clinically normal subjects) versus isolating underlying dimensions of AD cognitive decline (e.g., machine learning prediction of memory and language scores from network features). Finally, this study will determine whether features of AD pathology are present in an at-risk sample of subjects; namely, individuals diagnosed with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI). This will be examined by transferring the AD network models to aMCI subjects and testing whether the model can discriminate aMCI from clinically normal matched controls and whether the model can predict scores on cognitive tests. The analytic approach will using resting state fMRI data as a primary assay of network integrity, but diffusion imaging and task fMRI data will also be examined in an exploratory aim. The general approach will recruit individuals with AD, aMCI and clinically normal matched controls for each diagnostic group. The groups that are compared directly will be matched for amyloid status, as indicated by florbetapir PET imaging. The novel contributions of this project include (a) testing a network model of AD pathology that unifies various measures of network functioning, (b) comparing efficacy of modeling with respect to delineating diagnostic categories versus capturing underlying cognitive dimensions of AD, and (c) transferring the AD model to an at-risk group to assess disease vulnerability. This latter innovation can be applied in future studies to any group of subjects that is defined at risk, such as those with genetic vulnerability or positive family history. The present study also sets the stage for a subsequent longitudinal follow-up study to validate whether individuals identified at risk using network modeling actually convert to AD. Ultimately, network modeling of this sort may be used as a relatively less expensive and less invasive biomarker than PET imaging, which could lead to earlier treatments and interventions."
"9441460","Project Summary APOL1 risk variants (G1 & G2) have a prevalence of 30% and 8%, respectively among African Americans (AAs), and when present in homozygous state, increase the risk of non-diabetic end-stage kidney disease by 7-10 fold. Over 17,000 kidney transplants were performed in 2014, for which AAs accounted for 11% of living donors and 14.2% of deceased donors. The objective of this proposal is to establish the North East Consortium for Transplant outcomes in APOL1 kidney Recipients (NECTAR)-Clinical Center, a collaborative effort between the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai and Weill Cornell Medical Center, comprising 2 coordinating centers, 15 kidney transplant centers, 9 histocompatibility labs, 5 OPOs and central support from UNOS, representing 72% of all transplants in New York State and 98% of all transplants in New Jersey. The rationale for this proposal includes the following: (1) evolving current literature suggests that living kidney donors are at increased risk for chronic kidney disease (CKD), hypertension and proteinuria; (2) data point to an increased risk of death-censored graft loss in the presence of 2 APOL1 risk variants in the donor; (3) the association of APOL1 gene variants in living donors with the development of CKD, hypertension and proteinuria has not been characterized; and (4) prospective studies of clinical outcomes in AA and Hispanic living donors and their recipients are lacking. Our Specific Aims define the key components of the Consortium, namely to recruit the recipients of all donors of AA and non-AA donors of African descent, from the participating centers, over a period of two years to study the impact of APOL1 genotype on post-transplant outcomes, including but not limited to albumin-to-creatinine-ratio, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and graft survival. In addition, AA and non-AA donors of African descent living donors will be enrolled and followed longitudinally to determine the role of APOL1 risk variants in the development of hypertension, CKD and end stage renal disease (ESRD) post-donation. Both donors and recipients will be followed longitudinally for three years and biospecimens including blood, urine, stool and biopsies will be banked for the purpose of performing bioassays to identify secondary insults that contribute to or trigger the decline of renal function in either donors or recipients. Appropriate protocols and procedures will be established, including the creation of a web-based electronic data capture tool to collect and track data from research participants and procedures to ensure safe and efficient transfer of data and specimens to the Scientific Data Research Center.  "
"9564595","The long term goal of this study is to understand the mechanisms mediating osteoarthritis in aging. The specific goal of this study is to characterize the mechanism underlying how Cbf? mediates cartilage regeneration and repair in osteoarthritis. Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common form of arthritis affecting the knees, hips and spines, inflicting pain and physical limitation on over 70% of Americans between the age of 55 and 70. Current therapeutic options for OA are still limited to pain management and surgical intervention representing a significant concern in the aging population. Recent studies have shed light on the nature of OA genetic susceptibility and confirmed a number of candidate genes involved in the damage of the synovium, articular cartilage, and subchondral bone in OA pathogenesis, including Wnt signaling. However, the root causes of the disease remain unclear. Having investigated the gene expression patterns between OA patients and normal donors, and in combining with the known regulation data, Qingyou et al. identified a number of transcriptional factors and other genes which may play important roles in the development of OA including Core-binding factor beta (Cbf?). The PI?s lab has extensively study Cbf? function in osteoblasts and chondrocytes during mouse skeletal development. Nevertheless, the function of Cbf? in OA pathogenesis and articular cartilage regeneration and repair remains unclear. In order to study OA pathogenesis in chondrocyte- specific Cbf? deficient mice, we generated the inducible conditional knockout (CKO) Cbf?f/fCol2?1-CreER mice using Tamoxifen injections. We discovered that Cbf? CKO mice developed spontaneous OA at the age of 3.5 months, showing severe OA phenotype at the shoulders, knees, hips and spines. Our data demonstrated that Wnt canonical signaling was down-regulated and Yap expression was up-regulated in Cbf?f/fCol2?1-CreER mice and that Cbf? overexpression mediated by AAV-CMV-Cbf? has significant protection against OA. Based on our preliminary data, we hypothesize that deficiency of Cbf? is one of the main causes of cartilage degeneration in OA and aging and that overexpression of Cbf? enhances cartilage regeneration and repair in OA by regulating Wnt signaling and Yap signaling. We will test this hypothesis through three specific aims. In Aim 1, we will determine the roles of Cbf? in aging articular chondrocyte homeostasis through extensive phenotypic analyses of adult and aged, female and male Cbf?f/fCol2?1-CreER mice in physiological and pathological conditions. In Aim 2, we will define the function of Cbf? in cartilage regeneration and repair and preventing OA genesis in aging by characterizing Cbf? gain-of-function mouse model. We will dissect the mechanism underlying how Cbf? regulates Wnt and Yap signaling during chondrogenesis and articular cartilage regeneration and repair in Aim 3. The proposed study will provide important insights into the roles of Cbf? in OA by elucidating the mechanism by which Cbf? regulates Wnt and Yap signaling in articular cartilage regeneration and repair. A multidisciplinary research team been established to achieve the research goals."
"9222314","The mission of the Atlanta VAMC Rehabilitation Research and Development Center for Visual and Neurocognitive Rehabilitation (CVNR) is to foster the best possible health and well-being of Veterans through uniquely synergistic research studies targeting disorders impacting visual and/or neurocognitive function. Our Center's organization is designed to catalyze synergies amongst collaborating CVNR researchers and with scientist and clinician affiliates to maximize and accelerate tangible benefits for Veterans' health. The Internal Steering Group is the hub of CVNR operational decisions and comprises Krish Sathian, MD, PhD (Executive Director); Bruce Crosson, PhD (Executive Associate Director); Machelle Pardue, PhD (Associate Director for Scientific Projects); Steven Wolf, PT, PhD (Associate Director for Training), Patricia Griffiths, PhD (Assistant Director for Outreach); Keith McGregor, PhD (Career Development Awardees' Representative); and Lisa Calas (Administrative Officer).  The CVNR has three Research Programs: (A) Retinal & Neural Repair, (B) Visual Rehabilitation, and (C) Neurocognitive Rehabilitation. The CVNR's emphasis is on highly collaborative research efforts that straddle and integrate across the Programs. To this end, we plan three Integrative Projects that each draw on expertise and ideas from multiple Programs: (1) Physical exercise to prevent progression of age-related macular degeneration in Veterans; (2) Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation in aging and stroke: mechanistic pre-clinical studies using animal models; and (3) Making a psycho-educational tele- rehabilitative sleep intervention accessible for Veterans with visual impairment and their cohabitating care- partners. Each of these projects will be funded by the CVNR for an initial 2-year period, with the goal of seeding extramurally funded research by that time. In subsequent years, additional Integrative Projects will be funded after competitive review. Note that the activity of CVNR investigators is not limited to these Integrative Projects; each investigator is involved in multiple other projects that will be further enriched by the experiences and results of the Integrative Projects.  The CVNR will also fund a set of Cores to provide services to investigators. Three of these are ongoing: a Neuroimaging Core directed by Dr. Crosson, a Molecular Biology Core directed by Dr. Boatright, and an Administrative Core directed by Ms. Calas. Two additional Cores will be added in year 3 of the new grant cycle: a Physical Exercise Core directed by Dr. Nocera and a Tele-rehabilitation Core co-directed by Drs. Griffiths and McGregor and Mr. Ross. The CVNR has strong ties with local affiliates, including the Birmingham-Atlanta GRECC; Emory University, particularly its imaging centers, its Alzheimer's Disease Research Center, and its Departments of Neurology, Ophthalmology and Rehabilitation Medicine; Georgia Institute of Technology; the joint Biomedical Engineering Department of Emory and Georgia Tech; and Georgia State University.  Our research findings will be shared through the national network of Centers, disseminated in the scientific literature and at scientific meetings, presented to VA and other clinicians locally and nationally, and distilled into educational programs for Veterans, other consumer groups, and the community. The CVNR is committed to capacity building by recruiting trainees as well as junior and senior investigators into the VA system and providing trainees with outstanding mentorship to ensure the continued vitality of rehabilitation research."
"9467954","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Neuroscientists from underrepresents backgrounds drop out of predoctoral programs at a significantly higher rate than traditional students. This attrition has a detrimental impact on the scientific field as decreases in diversity diminish the range of techniques, perspectives, and potential for innovative collaborations necessary for scientific discovery. Therefore, the objective of the current proposal is to institute a robust individual research training plan to increase the diversity of the neuroscientific workforce. Specifically, a structured and formal training plan will supplement the applicant?s intensive dissertation research on the neurobiology of post-traumatic stress. Each year 25 million people in the United States suffer a traumatic event, however only about 30% of these individuals develop Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). Thus, there is individual variability in stress susceptibility, which may be due to variability in the neurobiology of post- traumatic stress. Currently, the acute effect (i.e. within a month) of post-traumatic stress on the brain is not well understood. Determining the impact of trauma-induced distress on brain structure, function, and biochemistry is critical for a thorough understanding of stress disorder that can then be translated into effective intervention and treatment programs. The applicant?s research during the F99 phase will utilize human neuroimaging technology with healthy and traumatized individuals to investigate how brain function, structure, and biochemistry vary with post-traumatic stress severity. The proposed research project will be completed in conjunction with a formal training plan. Specifically, training during the F99 phase will focus on developing competency in 1) MR methods/techniques, 2) scientific writing/presentation, and 3) mentorship skills. The applicant?s mentorship team includes established faculty members to provide formal training in these areas, as well as direct mentorship regarding particularly sensitive issues (e.g., self-efficacy, navigating professional interactions, etc.) for underrepresented minority scholars. The mentorship team is scientifically diverse drawing from faculty within the Departments of Psychology (Dr. David C. Knight ? Primary Mentor), Neurology (Dr. Jerzy Szaflarski), Psychiatry and Behavioral Neurobiology (Dr. Adrienne Lahti), and Neurobiology (Dr. Farah Lubin). As part of the K00 phase, the applicant intends to translate the findings from the F99 phase into clinical research using novel neuroimaging and neuromodulatory techniques. The research direction is intended to focus on 1) prediction of stress disorder following trauma via advanced/integrated neuroimaging techniques and 2) prevention of stress disorder development through neuromodulatory techniques. Training during the K00 phase will focus on developing competency in 1) novel research approaches, 2) research program development and management, and 3) teaching skills. The current application will guide the applicant through the academic pipeline and allow him to achieve his goal of becoming an independent neuroscientist."

"9326471","NRSA F32 APPLICATION ?Effects of Toluene On The Adolescent and Young Adult Mesocorticolimbic Pathway. PI: Wesley N. Wayman, Ph.D. Sponsor: John J. Woodward Ph.D. Abstract This NRSA application will support post-doctoral training in an individualized, integrated program involving physiology, neuroanatomy, morphology, and neurocircuitry of substance abuse. Many common household products such as paints, paint thinners, and glues, contain volatile organic substances (e.g. toluene) that are inhaled to produce mind-altering effects. Commonly referred to as inhalants, studies by the National Institute on Drug Abuse indicate that approximately 21.7 million Americans aged 12 and older have used inhalants at least once in their lives and are often one of the first and easiest options for abuse among adolescents and young adults trying drugs (NSDUH, 2013). Inhalants, like classical drugs of abuse, possess positive-reinforcing properties in rodent behavioral studies (Gerasimov et al., 2003, Blokhina et al., 2004, Lee et al., 2006) and are capable of modifying the reward circuitry, including key regions such as the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), nucleus accumbens (NAc), and ventral tegmental area (VTA) (Beckley and Woodward, 2011, Beckley et al., 2013, Beckley et al., 2015). Studies in this proposal will extend these findings by examining the effect of in vivo toluene exposure on markers of mPFC neuroplasticity/neurophysiology in adolescent/young adult rats. Specific Aim 1 will use whole-cell patch-clamp electrophysiology and dendritic spine analysis to determine whether toluene vapor exposure induces acute physiological and morphological alterations of mPFC pyramidal neurons. A novel in vivo fiber photometry approach coupled with the genetically encoded calcium sensor GCaMP6 will validate changes in mPFC activity in awake freely moving animals. Specific Aim 2 will test whether toluene-induced alterations in mPFC neuron excitability can be attenuated by modulating neuronal firing with DREADDs and will determine whether such modulation of neuronal firing attenuates toluene-induced CPP. Understanding the effects of toluene in adolescent and young adult rats will help elucidate the neural bases of toluene's abuse potential while expanding my technical abilities and advancing my career objective of becoming an independent academic neuroscientist."
"9565797","Project Summary/Abstract Low-income African Americans suffer increased risk of cardiovascular disease and death due to high levels of cardiovascular (CVD) risk factors, such as hypertension, diabetes and obesity. Improving diet quality in African Americans could reduce black-white health disparities but dietary interventions have been less successful in African Americans than other groups. ALIVE is a culturally-tailored, church-based diet intervention designed by a partnership of researchers, African American pastors and congregants using a community-based participatory research methodology. The main components of the intervention include a Bible study to increase intrinsic motivation to eat healthier, paired with small group sessions focused on bui lding self-efficacy through nutrition education, cooking instruction and behavior change techniques. All intervention components are delivered by church members in 24 sessions over 9 months. The ALIVE Pilot study resulted in clinically and statistically significant improvements in vegetable consumption, as well as increased diet quality and reductions in weight and blood pressure. The goal of the proposed study is to conduct a 21 -month behavioral clusterrandomizedcontrolledtrialinwhichchurchesarerandomizedtooneoftwoarms:theinterventionarm, which receives ALIVE intervention in year 1 and Money Smart, a financial education intervention, in year 2, or the comparison arm, which receives the interventions in the reverse order. This study design ad dresses the needs of community partners while controlling for a number of possible confounders such as attention. The primary aim of the study is to assess the efficacy of the ALIVE intervention by comparing enrolled congregants from intervention and comparison churches on change in diet quality as measured by the Alternative Healthy Eating Index (AHEI). Secondary study aims are to evaluate the effect of the ALIVE intervention on plasma carotenoids and evaluate potential mediators of change in diet quality, including self-efficacy, intrinsic motivation, attitudes and subjective social norms for eating healthy.

"9515355","PROJECT ABSTRACT It is well established that regular physical activity, including endurance (aerobic) exercise training and resistance exercise training has important effects on the prevention and treatment of numerous chronic diseases. Determining the molecular mechanisms or ?map? of the exercise response has become an important focus of biomedical research. The Molecular Transducers of Physical Exercise in Humans Consortium (MoTrPAC) will define the molecular footprint that underlies the enormously beneficial effects of exercise in humans. This application is for a Preclinical Animal Study Site (PASS). This Investigative team has the potential to play an important role in the design and execution of the MoTrPAC project based on our extensive experience and strong record of collaboration. The aims of Phase 1 are: 1) To provide outstanding intellectual contributions and advice, and work in a highly cooperative and collegial manner with the other members of the Steering Committee, to design the best possible experiments for the PASS studies. 2.) To use the wide variety of expertise in the laboratory to carry out highly controlled and accurate exercise studies and collection of animal tissue and blood samples. For this Phase, the rat has been identified as the animal model that most closely mimics humans and the most feasible to study. An emerging concept in exercise biology is that physical exercise activates tissue-to-tissue communication throughout the organism, and this tissue cross- talk can mediate some of the beneficial effects of exercise on health. The goal of Phase 2 is to carry out mechanistic studies to investigate newly and Consortium-identified circulating molecules involved in exercise- regulated tissue cross-talk, including identification of the function and source of the molecules. Skeletal muscle-derived myokines and adipose tissue-derived adipokines will be studied. The Specific Aims of Phase 2 of this project are: 1) To identify novel exercise-regulated adipokines and myokines based on data generated by MoTrPAC; 2) To determine the physiological targets and functions of candidate myokines and adipokines; 3) To determine if exercise-regulated myokines and adipokines can have beneficial effects on metabolic health in normal and metabolically compromised animals; and 4) To determine if putative exercise-induced myokines and adipokines are secreted from skeletal muscle and adipose tissue. These highly innovative studies will dramatically increase our understanding of the mechanisms by which physical activity improves human health and may provide the basis for future therapeutics to combat many chronic diseases."
"9448788","The goal of this proposal is to test whether an electronic shared decision making (eSDM) tool can increase the uptake of collaborative care (CC) for depression in primary care. Depression is projected to be the second largest contributor to chronic disease burden in the world by 2030, and contributes to disparities in quality of life and mortality. CC integrates primary and behavioral health through depression care managers who provide antidepressant adherence counseling and/or psychotherapy. CC doubles the rate of depression remission in comparison to primary care provider-led depression treatment alone, particularly in racial and ethnic minorities, and results in a 24% reduction in mortality and nearly $1300 in net annual savings per patient. Despite this model's potential to improve access to mental health, implementation efforts reveal low provider CC referral rates and low patient engagement rates of 9-50%, particularly in minority patients.  To identify factors contributing to poor patient engagement in CC, we conducted focus groups in 8 healthcare systems implementing CC, representing 33 clinics and 1 million predominantly Medicaid, minority patients. We learned that key physician-level barriers included limited time/resources to discuss treatment options and conduct ?warm handoffs? to care managers; patient-level barriers included poor knowledge of treatment options, miscommunication, stigma, language barriers, and low motivation. We applied a theory- informed process of engaging stakeholders to select an acceptable, feasible intervention and determined that SDM would target the greatest number of barriers to CC engagement. SDM involves a collaborative process whereby providers and patients make health decision together, and is a proven approach for improving depression treatment initiation and guideline concordant care, particularly in minorities, but widespread use has been limited by time and resources. Accordingly, we developed and alpha tested an iPad delivered, video-assisted, interactive eSDM tool that would reduce barriers to SDM uptake and target CC engagement.  We hypothesize that a state-of-the-art eSDM tool that automates the SDM process, activates providers, staff, and patients and interfaces with the electronic health record will improve efficient CC enrollment (primary outcome). We propose to refine and adapt the eSDM prototype (Aim 1) and conduct a stepped wedge trial across 4 primary care medical homes to assess the effectiveness of implementing our eSDM tool on provider behavior (Aim 2), patient enrollment in CC (Aim 3), patient adherence to depression treatment (therapy or antidepressants) and depressive symptoms (Exploratory Aims) amongst 1440 primary care patients in our healthcare system. Our study has the potential to produce a theory-informed, scalable eSDM tool that improves the reach of CC programs and potentially other team-based approaches."
"9418844","Abstract Germinal matrix hemorrhage (GMH) is the bleeding from the thin-walled immature blood vessels in the germinal matrix of pre?term infants. Post?hemorrhagic hydrocephalus is a common but severe consequence from GMH. However, there is no effective treatment for this so far but surgical shunting, which causes a huge socioeconomic burden. Thus, to characterize the underlying mechanisms and identify the potential therapeutic targets are of the utmost importance. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is mainly produced from the choroid plexus and reabsorbed by subarachnoid villi and to a greater extent in neonates, through the glymphatic system. GMH results in breakdown of blood products, inflammation and astrogliosis, which can damage periventricular tissues. Tissues responsible for maintaining normal CSF flow dynamics may be injured following GMH, contributing to post-hemorrhagic hydrocephalus. The choroid plexus is specialized for CSF production and regulating the blood-CSF barrier. Iron toxicity from lysed red blood cells after GMH may lead to increased expression of slc4a10, a sodium bicarbonate co-transporter responsible for CSF secretion, and consequent CSF over-secretion at the choroid plexus. Furthermore, glymphatic CSF drainage is postulated to play a great role in neonates, since subarachnoid villi are sparsely distributed, and its function may also be compromised following GMH. The glymphatic system involves astrocyte-mediated CSF-interstitial fluid (ISF) exchange in Virchow-Robin space, which is driven by astrocytic aquaporin-4. In addition, inwardly rectifying potassium channel 4.1 (Kir4.1) works in conjunction with aquaporin-4 in astrocytes for regulating osmotic gradients and consequent water flow, yet its role in glymphatic CSF-ISF exchange has not been established. Astrogliosis from GMH may alter aquaporin-4 and Kir4.1 expression or function, disrupting glymphatic CSF-ISF exchange and consequently reducing CSF reabsorption. Our overall hypothesis is that, following GMH, acute iron overload contributes to CSF overproduction at the choroid plexus by inducing slc4a10 and long-term astrogliosis impairs normal CSF reabsorption through the glymphatic system, leading to post- hemorrhagic hydrocephalus in neonates. To test this hypothesis, we will conduct our study in two specific aims. Specific Aim 1: Determine the role of iron-induced expression of slc4a10 at the choroid plexus after GMH, leading to increased CSF secretion. Specific Aim 2: Determine the role of GMH-induced astrogliosis and consequent Kir4.1 and aquaporin-4 expression in disrupting CSF-ISF exchange and CSF clearance through the glymphatic system.  "
"9365691","Project Summary Toxicological and epidemiologic studies have shown developmental neurotoxicity of polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), a group of flame retardants (FRs) widely used in the U.S. and elsewhere. With the phase-out of PBDEs from the market since 2004, replacement FRs, including organophosphate flame retardants (OPFRs) and novel brominated flame retardants (NBFRs), are increasingly added to consumer products to meet flammability requirement. Tris(1,3-dichloro-2-propyl) phosphate (TDCPP) and Firemaster® 550 (FM 550) are the most commonly used replacement FRs. TDCPP, also referred to as ?chlorinated tris?, is an OPFR once added to children?s sleepwear in the 1970s but later removed because of toxicity concerns. Triphenylphosphate (TPP) and various TPP analogs are OPFR components in FM 550, while 2-ethylhexyl- 2,3,4,5-tetrabromobenzoate (TBB) and bis(2-ethylhexyl)-2,3,4,5-tetrabromophthalate (TBPH) are NBFR components in FM 550. TDCPP, TPP and FM 550 have been reported to alter thyroid hormone levels, reduce neuronal viability and replication, alter neuronal differentiation, cause abnormal embryogenesis and development, affect neurobehavior, and change gene expression levels and DNA methylation in experimental studies. Compared with experimental study evidence of OPFRs and NBFRs, there are significant gaps in our understanding of their developmental neurotoxicity in humans. We propose to examine developmental neurotoxicity of OPFRs and NBFRs using the Cincinnati-based Health Outcomes and Measures of the Environment (HOME) Study, an existing birth cohort of 410 children from prenatal to 12 years of age, with prenatal and postnatal exposure assessment, thyroid hormones, cognitive and behavioral tests, and neuroimaging data. We hypothesize that prenatal and postnatal exposures to OPFRs and NBFRs are associated with: 1) altered thyroid hormone levels in maternal, cord, and childhood serum samples; 2) decreased child cognitive function; 3) poorer child neurobehavioral functioning; and 4) adverse impact on brain structure, organization, and function identified by neuroimaging at age 12 years. The proposed research will be the first to comprehensively study developmental neurotoxicity of both OPFRs and NBFRs in children. Addressing neuroendocrinological, neurobehavioral, and neuroimaging aspects of brain development is highly innovative for this investigation. The findings will be of critical value to scientific community and policy makers evaluating potential impact of current-use replacement FRs on developing brain. The research is highly relevant to the National Institutes of Health mission to identify potential chemical exposures that disrupt brain development and provide critical data to inform prevention strategies."

"9442584","The memory function of SPW-Rs depends critically on rapid sequential replay of memory items (e.g. spatial positions along an explored path). The question of how neural networks can produce accurate sequencing is an unsolved problem in neuroscience. Whereas Project 1 deals with the question of how SPW-Rs are initiated, Project 2 deals with how memory sequences are produced. Critical to this project is the need to determine the firing patterns of pyramidal cells and each of the major interneuron types during SPW-Rs. A large number of powerful new optical methods will be used to obtain this data. A second class of experiments will use optogenetic inactivation methods to determine whether the sequencing operation can be produced by events in CA2/CA3 alone, or whether the dentate gyrus (DG) can also influence SPW-R content. We further hope to reveal the basis of important discretization processes that govern SPW-R-related memory sequencing. There have been indications that memory readout during SPW-Rs is discretized by gamma oscillations - in Project 2, we will attempt to verify this and shed light on the basis of this timing operation. Other experiments will provide information relevant to understanding SPW-R termination processes. Collectively, this information, in conjunction with the analysis and simulations proposed in Project 5, is likely to answer fundamental questions about the cellular and network mechanisms governing the recruitment and sequencing of memory content during SPW-R-related replay."
"9275836","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):          Traumatic brain injuries (TBI) have been called the signature injury from the Iraq and Afghanistan wars. These injuries result in a variety of problems, including impairments in sensation, action and cognition. Importantly, even mild traumatic brain injuries can result in cognitive and executive function problems. Though the exact cause of these symptoms have not been completely worked out, they are likely caused by a break-down in white-matter fiber tracts that help to connect large-scale neural-networks underlying complex cognitive operations. Unfortunately, there are no treatments that can effectively repair these neural circuits at present Indeed, there are no valid pre-clinical models of these circuit dysfunctions to even begin to test and develop novel circuit-based treatment approaches for TBI. In this research proposal, I aim to develop a pre-clinical model of micro and macro-circuit dysfunction following traumatic-brain injury in rodents. I will first characterize how injury disrupts cortical networks underlying sensorimotor function, by recording from premotor, motor and sensory cortex after TBI-injury. I will study both local circuits within these regions and long-range coupling between these regions. In addition, I will study how physiological changes that occur in these networks following treatments that promote motor recovery. In this set of studies, I will attempt to clearly  understand both how TBI disrupts sensorimotor cortical networks; and the specific ways in which treatments drives plasticity in the affected networks. Next, I will test one specific neuro-engineering approach to enhancing plasticity in affected networks, and will study whether this can enhance plasticity and induce motor recovery. Specifically, I will use brain-computer-interface technologies to enhance connectivity within nodes of the sensorimotor cortical network, thus repairing the broken circuit. I will assess how this BMI-approach can be used to drive physiologic, anatomic and cortical motor map plasticity and induce motor recovery. If successful, this proposal could herald a fundamentally new approach for ameliorating cognitive and behavioral dysfunction after TBI, as well as a host of other neurologic and psychiatric illnesses."
"9564331","Aging and the sex-specific chromatin in Drosophila The chromatin landscape is key for gene regulation, but little is known about how it differs between sexes, or over adult life. There is accumulating evidence that chromatin changes during an individual's lifespan contribute to cellular aging. In particular, loss of heterochromatin has been observed in aged cells of several species, including Drosophila. Age-specific mortality rates of male flies are higher and average lifespans are shorter than those of females. Males also contain substantially more heterochromatic DNA than females, due to the presence of a large, repeat-rich Y chromosome, and our preliminary data suggest that the presence of sex chromosomes with different epigenetic profiles in Drosophila (that is, a hyper-transcribed dosage compensated X chromosome, and a silenced heterochromatic Y) result in global changes of chromatin structure between sexes. We propose to compare sex-specific gene expression and epigenetic profiles in Drosophila species and strains with different sex chromosome karyotypes across their lifespan, to study the influence of sex- specific chromatin differences on cellular aging. We will experimentally modify protein levels of genes involved in heterochromatin maintenance, to directly test if heterochromatin formation is a main contributor to sex-specific epigenetic profiles and longevity. Additionally, we will assay chromatin states in time- series samples, and characterize tissue-specific chromatin states in aged vs. young flies, to address the temporal dynamics of changes in chromatin during aging, and potentially important differences in cellular aging across tissues."
"9341825","Abstract  MetaMedia, and partner Healthy Teen Network, will develop a mobile application aimed at reducing teen pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections (STIs) among Latino and African American men aged 15-19. In the U.S., teen pregnancy, teen births and STIs affect African American and Latino youth in greater proportion compared to other youth. A comprehensive literature search revealed that multiple sexual and reproductive health apps exist for adolescents in general; however, none were found that specifically address the needs of diverse young males. And none were evaluated for behavior change.  During the SBIR Phase 1 study, the project team will achieve three aims/objectives. First, it will conduct a five-phased qualitative formative study to guide the development of MAPP. The formative study will obtain: 1) youth suggestions/ideas for app content, features, branding, and visual design; 2) youth feedback on the readability, word/language usage, and amount and phrasing of the app's text; 3) youth feedback on the mechanics, educational messages, and interest of an interactive game(s); 4) youth feedback on usability and navigation by conducting a user-centered walkthrough of the app; and 5) quality assurance feedback from project team staff. Second, it will develop a mobile app that strategically addresses a prioritized set of determinants of five sexual health behaviors directly related to preventing pregnancy/STIs while applying principles and preferences of how young men learn. These behaviors include: 1) delay the onset of sexual initiation/reduce the frequency of sex, 2) increase correct and consistent use of condoms, 3) increase support to female partners in the correct and consistent use of effective forms of contraception, 4) reduce the number of sexual partners/concurrent sexual partners, and 5) increase visits to health centers for STI testing and treatment. And third, it will develop an educational and entertaining game that reinforces key behavioral messages presented in MAPP. In the SBIR Phase II of the study, MAPP will be rigorously evaluated using adequately powered samples. In addition, a commercialization and marketing plan will be developed to maximize MAPP's commercialization potential and wide dissemination to youth and youth-serving professionals.  MetaMedia, a small business with 35 years of experience, is a pioneer in adapting emerging technologies to improve learning and performance. Healthy Teen Network, a national nonprofit organization with 30 years of experience, has a proven track record in applying evidence approaches to develop and evaluate teen pregnancy and STI prevention interventions. Their organizational missions and experience create an ideal partnership for this project."

"9284346","With the widespread adoption of Electronic Health Records (EHRs) there has been a growing appreciation of the unintended consequences associated with their adoption and specifically the negative impacts on productivity and workflow. Consequently, there has been dramatic growth in the use of medical scribes to aid providers by, in essence, ?untethering the provider from the EHR?. In spite of this rapid growth, and the purported benefits on improving physician efficiency and improved billing, there is little to no regulation on standardization of scribe training, nor any assessment of their ability to safely interface with the EHR. To better understand the role and functionality of scribes, we undertook a national survey of health care providers. We found that scribes comprise a wide range of personnel from college students to Medical Assistants. There is wide variability in their training, with the majority of scribes receiving job specific training by the hiring practice. In terms of scribe function, again there was wide variability in scribe activities with relation to the EHR, from simple encounter note creation, to finding information in the EHR for the physicians to entering orders and responding to patient messages. We directly assessed scribe function at OHSU in a novel video based virtual simulation. We found that there is tremendous intra-scribe variability in note creation and structure. This corresponds to significant errors of omission and commission (incorrect information entered into the system). Specifically, the average scribe captured only 40% of the diagnoses or plans mentioned in the simulation with less than 40% overlap in documentation between scribes. Further, every scribe documented a number of incorrect plan and diagnosis items. Combined, these data suggest a new and potentially significant safety issue with scribe use of the EHR. Therefore the goal of this proposal is to fully assess the scope of scribe use with respect to the EHR and use this information in conjunction with national experts in EHR safety and medical documentation to establish a series Entrustable Professional Activities (EPAs) for medical scribes. We will use these as basis to create and validate a toolkit to allow for organizations to assess the ability of scribe to complete these EPAs. In Aim #1, we will use a combination of surveys and site visits to assess the landscape of scribe functionality. This information will then serve as the basis for a consensus conference to define scribe Entrustable Professional Activities (EPAs) with respect to the EHR. In Aim #2 we will map these EPAs to a set of competencies and create a curriculum to assess these competencies. This curriculum will contain a series on online EHR didactics and video based simulation exercises with corresponding simulated EHR records to asses real world performance of scribes. In Aim #3, we will calibrate and validate this curriculum across a variety of specialties and EHR use expectations with current scribes. In Aim #4, we will hold another consensus conference to review the curricular elements and use the results to create an online toolkit to allow providers and health care organization to assess scribe competency. Thus by the end of the study period we will have a web based, comprehensive toolkit to allow for real-world assessment of safe and accurate use of EHR by medical scribes across a range of EHR functional levels and a variety of specialties and environments."
"9541781","Project Summary: Novel Activators of Regeneration in Müller Glia Müller glia are the predominant source of regenerative repair in the fish retina, but this is not the case in humans, where Müller glia respond to injury, pathology, or degeneration by becoming reactive, and, in many cases, gliotic. Recent research in non-regenerative mammalian model systems, such as the mouse, suggests that Müller glia could be pushed down a regenerative pathway, but bona-fide regeneration and repair will involve factors and protocols that are not yet identified. To address this gap in knowledge, we propose three projects that focus on the proliferative and neurogenic properties needed for regeneration. In the first project, we will develop a regeneration-priming protocol for mouse Müller glia through modulation of neurotransmitter uptake and inhibition of p27Kip1, a cell cycle protein that prevents properties associated with reactivity and regeneration in Müller glia. In the second project, we will perform a screen using exosomes to discover candidate exosomes and their constituent proteins and/or RNAs that stimulate regenerative properties in zebrafish and mouse Müller glia. In the third project, we will develop thiouracil tagging combined with RNA sequencing to capture the transcriptomes of Müller glia in selected states of regeneration based on our work from the first two projects. The culmination of this work will yield new factors for promoting regeneration and provide proof-of-concept for exosome-based delivery of factors as a therapeutic strategy."
"9466988","Abstract Breast cancer (BC) is the most common cancer among women. Viruses have long been suspected as a cause of breast cancer. However, despite the identification of virions in human BC cells and human milk and numerous studies that suggest possible connection between breast cancer and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV), and human papilloma virus (HPV), the tumorigenic potential of these viruses has not been proven in BC. Our preliminary data offer the compelling evidence that a filterable transforming agent is present in the supernatant of a BC cell line that we established in vitro. This agent is transmissible, transforms primary human mammary epithelial cells in vitro, and confers these cells the tumorigenic phenotype in vivo. Based on preliminary results, we hypothesize that a virus accounts for the observed human mammary epithelial cells transforming activity. This application has the very focused objective of isolating and characterizing this transforming agent employing comprehensive and complementary proteomics and transcriptomics approaches and in vitro genetic validation systems. The results of this study will provide the first evidence of a human mammary epithelial cells transforming agent and shed new light into tumor pathogenesis. Importantly, the isolation of a BC transforming virus will allow the development of novel diagnostic tools, vaccines, and specific inhibitors of significant therapeutic value."
"9356494","Wrong-drug and wrong-patient errors occur at a rate of roughly one per thousand orders in inpatient and outpatient settings, resulting in millions of potentially harmful errors annually in the US. Accurate problem lists help prevent wrong-drug and wrong-patient errors by allowing the electronic medical record (EMR) to remind prescribers when orders do not match the problem list. Unfortunately, problem lists are often inaccurate. Indication alerts prompt prescribers to add new problems to the problem list when a drug order does not match the problem list. Indication alerts also promote self-interception of wrong-drug and wrong-patient errors by increasing situation awareness. Two types of self-interception events can be measured in an automated way: (a) abandon-and-reorder?a prescriber starts then abandons an incorrect order before signing it, and then re- orders for the correct drug or patient; or (b) retract-and-reorder?a prescriber cancels an incorrect order soon after signing it, and then re-orders for the correct drug or patient. Previous work used the abandon-and-reorder and retract-and-reorder methods to measure the effectiveness of several interventions, including indication alerts, in reducing wrong-drug and wrong-patient errors, but that work was limited. First, only a small number of drugs were studied. Second, prior studies were done at a single medical center and involved only one commercial EHR. Third, until 2016, there was no validated, National Quality Forum-endorsed instrument for estimating the rate of wrong-patient orders. Fourth, the prior studies of indication alerts used posttest only designs and therefore could not test for an increase in the self-interception rate over baseline. The proposed project addresses these limitations in the earlier work and fills important gaps in knowledge about how to prevent wrong-drug and wrong-patient errors and how to improve the completeness of problem lists. The project's Specific Aims are: 1. At one hospital in Chicago and six in New York City, using two commercial EMR systems, implement a set of 30-50 indication alerts for medications that are vulnerable to look-alike and sound-alike errors. 2. Using an interrupted time series study design, quantify the effect of indication alerts on (a) the combined rate of self-intercepted wrong-drug and wrong-patient computerized prescriber order entry (CPOE) errors and (b) on the rate of each type of error viewed separately. It is predicted that indication alerts will increase the combined rate of self-intercepted wrong-drug and wrong-patient errors by roughly 25%, from 158 to 196 events per 100,000 orders, and will increase the self-interception rate of each type when viewed separately, as measured by an increase in the sum of abandon-and-reorder and retract-and-reorder events. 3. Assess the impact of indication alerts on the probability of adding new diagnoses to the problem list during encounters that include CPOE. It is predicted that indication alerts will double the likelihood that a problem is placed on the problem list during encounters that include CPOE, with new problems being placed during 12% of pre-intervention orders and 25% of post-intervention orders. The intervention should add to knowledge and improve quality and patient safety."
"9461879","PROJECT SUMMARY Recent advances in stem cell biology hold great potential in developing new approaches for the treatment of many devastating diseases, including musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs). Stem cell-based therapies for regenerating functional muscle cells and restoring muscular functions to damaged skeletal muscles can be critical for the development of therapeutic advances in musculoskeletal disease and disorder. Such approaches, however, require the generation of engraftable cell sources of functional myogenic cells and better control of stem cell myogenic differentiation in an effective, selective, and safe manner.  To this end, the main goal of this proposal is to develop a bio-inspired platform that can replicate the structure and function on endogenous proteins called transfection factors (TFs; MyoD and Myogenin), which are specific for muscle-specific genes and responsible for orchestrating overall stem differentiation into muscle cells. Our bio-inspired platform called NanoScript, is a nanoparticle-based transcription factor that behaves and function just like natural TF proteins. This NanoScript platform is designed to be gene-specific and can effectively activate targeted gene expressions (e.g. MyoD, Myogenin and the related endogenous genes) in a non-toxic and non- viral manner. Out central hypothesis, based upon recent achievement and preliminary data, is that our proposed NanoScript platform can effectively generate functional muscle cells from human patient-derived adipose- derived mesenchymal stem cells (AMDSCs), which are an abundant source of stem cells, with patient-specific stem cells treatment possibilities.  We propose to test our central hypothesis and achieve our objectives by addressing the following specific aims: Aim1: Design and synthesize muscle cell-specific TFs (MRF) and epigenetic modulators for the construction of enhanced muscle cell-specific NanoScripts [NanoScripts-MRF]. Aim2: Utilize NanoScript to activate muscle-specific genes in ADMSCs for generating muscle cells.  The proposed research is innovative, as this concept of developing a TF emulator by integrating two multidisciplinary approaches (chemical biology and nanomedicine) onto a single nano-platform for non-viral gene regulation in stem cells has not been developed. The proposed research is significant, since we will develop an innovative technology platform and our NanoScript is an easily tunable and robust platform, it can be further developed to combine with epigenetic modulators or other synergists for effective and selective induction of functional muscle cells. Collectively, upon successful completion of the proposed study, our expectations are that NanoScript-MRF will activate transcription of the muscular-specific genes containing their cognate TF consensus DNA binding domain, which will lead to an enhanced stem differentiation into muscle cells. Because NanoScript is non-toxic and non-viral, the generated muscle cells will be considered for translation into in vivo animal studies in future studies."
"9353749","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Medication discrepancies, i.e., unexplained differences in medication regimens across different sites of care, are very common and represent a major threat to patient safety. One solution is medication reconciliation. The AHRQ-funded Multi-Center Medication Reconciliation Quality Improvement Study (MARQUIS) conducted at five US hospitals consolidated best practices and rigorously evaluated them in a real-world setting. Results showed significant reductions in potentially harmful medication discrepancies. The MARQUIS toolkit, now refined based on lessons learned from the prior study, provides a scalable and testable approach to markedly improve medication safety at numerous institutions.  The long-term objective of this research is to widely disseminate, implement, and evaluate sustainable medication reconciliation interventions that improve patient safety during care transitions. We aim to implement the refined MARQUIS toolkit at 18 diverse hospitals using a mentored implementation model, to rigorously evaluate the effects on unintentional medication discrepancies, and to evaluate the success of implementation using the RE-AIM framework (Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance) to inform future dissemination.  Prospective sites will be selected based on their interest and on their readiness to participate (e.g., demonstration of institutional support and data collection resources). Mentors will conduct one site visit and monthly phone calls to assist local site leaders with implementation. The MARQUIS toolkit will include a core medication reconciliation bundle; the use of more intensive interventions in high-risk patients; provider training and the use of dedicated personnel for certain tasks (e.g., discharge medication counseling); improving access to pre-admission medication sources (e.g., by empowering patients to maintain their own medication lists); improving implementation of information technology; and social marketing techniques aimed at both patients and providers. The primary outcome will be the number of unintentional medication discrepancies in admission and discharge orders using methods refined over several studies and analyzed using segmented regression methods to measure improvement over baseline temporal trends. Program evaluation using RE-AIM will provide lessons to inform the spread of future medication reconciliation interventions. A Patient-Family Advisory Council will ensure that patients assume a vital role in the research effort. Dissemination plans will be developed with input from a multi-stakeholder team.  This project will provide valuable information regarding the most effective ways to support safe medication use and improve health care delivery during care transitions."
"9457104","Summary The critical role of the immune system in effecting anti-tumor responses to traditional and molecularly-targeted therapies is increasingly recognized, such that there is now an explosion of activity in the clinical investigation of immuno-oncology. In parallel, we have gained great advances in our ability to extract useful biologic information from patient material through the development of: (i) high-throughput DNA/RNA sequencing, that has uncovered major genetic determinants of clinically-evident immune responses; (ii) highly multiplexed biological assays, that have revealed the complex interplay between immunity and cancer in relation to therapy; and (iii) advanced computational methods, that have enabled large-scale integrative data analysis. Underlying this activity is a need to identify the critical biomarkers of response and resistance to therapy in each disease and across diseases. With the rapidly evolving clinical and experimental developments in immunotherapy occurring across all major academic centers, the need to build a coordinated infrastructure for data collection, processing and analysis has emerged as a high priority. At Dana-Farber Cancer Institute (DFCI), the Center of Immuno-Oncology (CIO) was established several years ago and is a local hub of translational immuno-oncology activity. As a part of its mission, the CIO supports dedicated translational biomarker laboratories to provide expertise in the analysis of immune correlatives in the service of immuno-oncology trials. Collectively, these resources provide multidisciplinary capabilities supporting both investigator-initiated and externally-sponsored studies ranging from clinical trial design, the performance of well-validated immune monitoring capabilities on patient samples during trials, the interpretation of data from immune monitoring testing, and the development of novel assays based on the scientific questions motivated by individual clinical studies. We propose to expand the laboratory and biostatistical capabilities of the CIO along with those of additional DFCI units as a Cancer Immune Monitoring and Analysis Center (CIMAC). We want to coordinate the efforts of the proposed DFCI-CIMAC with other CIMACs and with the Cancer Immunologic Data Commons (CIDC) to develop the standards for designing studies rich with immune correlatives and informative for candidate biomarkers, to be tested in future trials. Aim 1 focuses on harmonizing the technical aspects of assays offered by the CIMACs; Aim 2 focuses on the assay-specific scoring analyses and reporting of CIMAC offerings. Modeled on our long history of implementing standard and innovative assays to study DFCI phase I/II trials, we describe a process for using `Tier 1' `shovel-ready' assays that we expect as standard components of an immune monitoring tool-kit and `Tier 2' assays that are tailored to the specific needs of a study (Aim 3). Altogether, these efforts fall within the concept and vision of personalized medicine for immuno-oncology because only by the analyses of large well-annotated datasets can we identify links between biology, molecular markers and clinical response."
"9470537","Project Summary/Abstract The placenta plays a central role in regulating growth and development of the fetus. In 2015, the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development allocated $41.5 million to the Human Placenta Project (HPP) in recognition of the importance of this role and in recognition of limitations in knowledge about factors that affect placental function. The HPP focuses primarily on advances in real-time placental imaging. While an important initiative, the technologies and methods developed likely won't be utilized in low-risk pregnancies, and thus may have limited applicability to understanding the relationship between placental phenotype and fetal outcomes in the general population. Postnatal placental measures, therefore, may supplement findings from the HPP to better understand this relationship. Additionally, several studies have demonstrated that placental function and efficiency are associated with placental morphology. Currently, fetuses and neonates are identified as experiencing suboptimal fetal growth based on estimated fetal weight or birth weight for gestational age percentiles. These measures incorrectly capture neonates who are constitutionally small while failing to capture neonates who are larger, yet still experienced suboptimal fetal growth. Identification of these neonates is important as they are at greater risk of cognitive delay and other adverse outcomes in childhood, as well as cardiovascular disease in adulthood. If identified early, tertiary prevention resources can be targeted to mitigate the potential for adverse outcomes. This proposed research project seeks to investigate whether features of placental morphology (including thickness, shape, surface area, and centrality of umbilical cord insertion) can be used to identify neonates who experienced suboptimal fetal growth and thus are at higher risk of adverse cognitive outcomes. Aim 1 will evaluate the validity of using placental diameters to calculate surface area, which will inform sensitivity analyses for the subsequent aims. Aim 2 will evaluate the relationships between features of placental morphology and birth weight in dichorionic twins. Aim 3 will estimate the associations between features of placental morphology and cognitive outcomes in five to seven year-old children, evaluated separately in singletons and dichorionic twins. Dichorionic twins are an understudied population that have a higher prevalence of suboptimal fetal growth and present a unique opportunity to control for key confounders (e.g., gestational age, in utero environment). Results from this proposed research project will improve our understanding of the role of the placenta in regulating fetal growth and development and the extent to which this correlates with adverse cognitive outcomes in childhood. Better identification of neonates at higher risk of adverse cognitive outcomes will allow for enhanced targeting of early intervention resources, thereby potentially leading to improved cognitive outcomes in childhood."
"9348605","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The objective of this award is to allow me to obtain the training, mentoring, and experience necessary to become an independent health services researcher in patient safety and informatics. My ultimate goal is to develop a career as an academic leader, using multidisciplinary science to improve the quality of health care related to electronic health record (EHR)-based communication. To accomplish this, I will seek to develop and sharpen a skill set essential to working as a patient safety and informatics health services researcher. I will use the protected time provided by this award to gain training and experience in three principal areas: techniques to evaluate workflow processes, qualitative research methodologies, and human factors principles. Delays in diagnosis and treatment from breakdowns in communication between providers are a common problem in health care and contribute to adverse patient outcomes and malpractice litigation. The importance of identifying strategies to prevent such delays has been highlighted in a recent Agency for Healthcare Research & Quality Special Emphasis Notice (NOT-HS-13-009). I will build on a foundation of work by our team revealing that despite providers' increased use of electronic health record (EHR)-based tools to manage communication, these delays persist. Multiple factors are believed to contribute to such delays, but three are frequent, well-studied, and serve as ideal targets for intervention. These include information overload from large numbers of messages transmitted to providers, lack of EHR-based communication tools that promote situational awareness, and poor ease of use of existing electronic communication tools, which leads to inefficiencies in message processing. In the research proposed, I will use multidisciplinary approach to evaluate electronic communication tools. Specifically, I will evaluate the processes used by providers to manage electronic messages and identify factors that impact communication efficiency and breakdowns. I will then use this information to develop and test a prototype tool that improves processing efficiency, situational awareness, and ease of use. The specific aims of this project are: Aim 1: Evaluate provider asynchronous electronic communication management processes in order to identify facilitators and barriers of provider efficiency and situational awareness. Aim 2: Develop an asynchronous electronic communication prototype tool that optimizes provider efficiency, situational awareness, and ease of use. Aim 3: Evaluate the efficiency, situational awareness, and ease of use of the prototype tool in a simulated environment. Two highly-qualified mentors with substantial experience in patient safety and informatics research will supervise training, which will include mentored research, formal coursework, directed readings, and seminars. The proposed activities will provide a foundation for electronic communication tool designs that improve situational awareness, efficiency, and ease of use. This will reduce delays in diagnosis from communication breakdowns and reduce provider EHR message processing burden, allowing more time for direct patient care."
"9395507","Project Summary My career aspiration is to become a research scientist at a university or academic medical center, specializing in health disparities research that focuses on the development of, and risk factors for, suicidal behavior in underserved populations. Broadly, the proposed project aims to significantly advance our understanding of risk factors for suicidal behavior in the Bhutanese refugee population living in the United States. The proposed NRSA will test (1) a comprehensive conceptual model of suicidal behavior by examining incremental risk factors for suicide including suicidal desire, suicidal ideation, thwarted belongingness, and perceived burdensomeness in Bhutanese refugees and (2) the relative contributions of suicidal desire and suicidal ideation as risk factors for suicidal behavior in Bhutanese refugees. Based on the Interpersonal Psychological Theory of Suicide (IPTS),6 the proposed conceptual model posits that (a) higher levels of perceived burdensomeness and higher levels of thwarted belongingness each, independently, predict increases in suicidal desire and ideation. Additionally, our model will examine (b) the extent to which the interaction of perceived burdensomeness and thwarted belongingness contributes to suicidal desire and suicidal ideation, separately. Finally, our model proposes (c) that suicidal desire captures additional risk of suicidal behavior above and beyond suicidal ideation, alone. Our proposed conceptual model will provide the necessary preliminary evidence for a cultural adaptation of well-established proximal risk factors of suicidal behavior and will aid in identifying the earliest and most accurate warning signs for suicide risk in Bhutanese refugees to date. This study will lay the groundwork for future longitudinal tests of the proposed risk factors for suicidal behavior and will allow for the development of interventions designed specifically to reduce suicidal behavior among Bhutanese refugees. !"
"9442587","Throughout our investigation of the mechanisms underlying hippocampal memory replay, we will employ a strategy of continuous interaction between experimental and modeling approaches. First, we consider conceptual models, and formulate hypotheses relevant to the initiation, generation and termination of SPW-Rs. Then, as we gather critical new experimental data to test those hypotheses in Projects 1-4, we will use that data to constrain full-scale biophysically-detailed computational models of hippocampal networks, integrating a newly developed model of CA3 with existing models of dentate gyrus (DG) and CA1. These models will then be used to predict the complex responses of the network to simulated perturbations, help interpret experimental outcomes, inform hypotheses about underlying principles, and suggest new experiments to test those hypotheses. In addition to an improved conceptual understanding of memory replay, our final product will include full-scale network models of the hippocampus with unprecedented functionality, fully open-sourced and freely available to the broader neuroscience community. !"
"9351144","Abstract Enhancers are the genomic elements that encode the instructions for when and where genes are expressed during development. The majority of mutations leading to disease are thought to reside in enhancers. However, we do not understand which changes in enhancer sequence are inert sequence variations between individuals or populations and which impact gene regulation and cellular integrity. These fundamental questions remain unsolved, because we cannot relate enhancer sequence to gene expression and phenotype. This gap in our knowledge is stalling our ability to interpret genomic data and understand development, cellular integrity, and diseases. Enhancer sequences provide a scaffold for transcription factors to bind to, by recognizing specific signatures in the DNA. The physical constraints that govern how these proteins interact with enhancer DNA could lead to a set of grammatical constraints that can be used to understand the relationship between enhancer sequence and tissue specific gene expression. I propose the development of a toolkit of methodologies and approaches to decipher the grammatical constraints on tissue specific enhancer activity. I will use highly parallel functional reporter assays, high-throughput genotype to phenotype studies along with biochemical assays, synthetic biology, and loss of function strategies. These experiments will be carried out in the chordate Ciona intestinalis, as it is a unique system in which millions of enhancer variants can be assayed for function in all cells of a developing embryo. Work in Ciona will be complemented with experiments in chick, mouse and tissue culture to directly inform vertebrate development and pinpoint mutations causing disease. Determining the ?genetic code? that relates the coding sequences of genes into protein has provided detailed insight into a major component of our genome. Once we have a similar code to decipher the instructions for when and where these genes are expressed, we will have powerful tools to understand how the genome encodes the instructions for building and maintaining life."
"9438041","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Cancer is the second-leading cause of death in the United States, yet this burden continues to disproportionately affect vulnerable populations including low-income, minority, and geographically isolated communities. Of all cancers, breast, colorectal, and cervical are those most amenable to early detection via evidence-based screening procedures. Patient navigation is an evidence-based practice to improve adherence to cancer screening as well as diagnostic and treatment guidelines among vulnerable populations. Specifically, several studies show that patient navigation improves mammography, cervical screening, and colonoscopy rates for low-income and/or racial/ethnic minority patients. While cancer prevention and control programs are increasingly using patient navigators (PNs) to facilitate healthcare access as well as continuity and quality of care among vulnerable patients, not enough is known about the scope and context of practice of these PNs nor their background and training, especially within community settings. This information is vital for optimizing the delivery of patient navigation activities both inside and outside of health systems. Identifying training and resource needs as well as disseminating best-practices among PNs may also facilitate reductions in cancer disparities. The purpose of SIP 17-003, Formative Study of Patient Navigators with the National Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection Program (NBCCEDP) and the Colorectal Cancer Control Program (CRCCP), is to conduct a comprehensive assessment of PNs. The primary aim of this study is to characterize PNs working with the NBCCEDP and CRCCP including their roles and responsibilities, work environment, and training and technical assistance needs. The proposed activities will advance the science of PN interventions and will support efforts to scale-up and optimize the delivery of patient navigation services, especially within the context of NBCCEDP and CRCCP. We will achieve this aim by conducting the following activities in collaboration with CDC and NBCCEDP and CRCCP grantees: 1) identify affiliated PNs; 2) develop and administer an online survey to assess the background, training, roles and responsibilities, work environment, and training and technical assistance needs among affiliated PNs; and 3) interview a subset of approximately 30 survey respondents to elucidate key differences in experiences and training/technical assistance needs by factors such as practice setting (clinical versus non-clinical) and type of training (nurse v. health educator, for example). Our team is well-positioned to work with NBCCEDP and CRCCP grantees to conduct the proposed activities and to disseminate the findings. As part of CDC's Cancer Prevention and Control Research Network, we already collaborate with NBCCEDP and CRCCP to gather evaluation data directly from grantees, share findings with CDC and the grantees, and publish the results. Our investigators also work with federally qualified health centers and other healthcare systems in multiple states and participate in practice networks that provide opportunities for further dissemination of study findings beyond NBCCEDP and CRCCP grantees."
"9327668","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): To stimulate health system transformation, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) launched the State Innovation Model (SIM) Initiative, which since 2013, has invested more than 1 billion dollars in state efforts to plan, piot test, and implement payment and delivery system reforms. The SIM Initiative is an ongoing, naturally occurring federal-state policy intervention that provides financial and technical support to states for development and testing state-led multi-payer health care payment and service delivery models. The goals of this federal-state program are to improve health system performance, improve the quality of patient care, and decrease health care costs for all residents of the state. As states are investing in transformational restructuring of incentives and delivery systems, the SIM Initiative is anticipated to improve health status overall, including diabetes risk and health status in large segments of the community. In order to achieve SIM Initiative goals, most SIM states are focusing on chronic illness, in general, and diabetes, in particular. We propose a natural experiment rigorously designed to optimize the ability to draw causal inferences. Using diverse data from multiple sources we will assess this population-targeted policy to assess outcomes at multiple levels, including state, county, and physician organization and delivery system levels. From 2015 to 2019, we will monitor and track payment and delivery system reforms relevant to preventing, and managing complications of, diabetes. This will be done for 18 purposively sampled states: 6 Round 1 states, 6 Round 2 states, and 6 waiting control states. Using these policy data, we will develop a taxonomy of state SIM implementation to empirically examine how SIM implementation affects practice implementation of the patient-centered medical home (PCMH) model and participation in accountable care organizations (ACOs). We will use propensity score matching of patients in a stepped wedge research design to examine the impact of the staged implementation of SIM plans across the states. We will estimate the impact of the SIM Initiative on diabetes-related health behaviors (2011-2018) and hospitalizations due to diabetes (2011-2017) for Round 1 vs. Round 2 vs. waiting control states. The influence of delivery system and payment reform activities implemented as part of each states' SIM plan will be explored. Finally, we estimate the economic impact of the SIM Initiative's improvements in diabetes care prevention and management and explore heterogeneity in economic impacts across SIM states. The proposed collaborative project will yield actionable data and analyses to state and local health officials, and public health and health care delivery stakeholders on the impact of the SIM Initiative on improvements on diabetes prevention and management."
"9565786","Project Summary Heart disease was responsible for 614,348 deaths in 2014, making it the leading cause of death for both women and men in the United States [1]. Over 400,000 coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) procedures were performed in 2010 alone, with reintervention rates reported to be as high as 8.8% [2]. In addition to limited autologous tissue availability, the treatment of small diameter vascular disease is hindered by the compliance mismatch of currently delivered grafts that lead to subsequent failure via intimal hyperplasia (IH) and graft thrombosis [3-7]. Despite significant recent progress, the development of a compliance matched and biologically functional TEVG has remained elusive. The utility of biopolymer based constructs have been promising [8], however there has been limited success in modulating the compliance and mechanical properties of these materials. Our overall hypothesis is that a TEVG composed primarily of alternating layers of gelatin and tropoelastin can be compliance matched to native tissue and, when lined with an autologous blood derived endothelium, reduce the current failure modes of small diameter vascular grafts. We further hypothesize that the elution of TGF?2 from our graft will maintain the compliance of our TEVG following implantation. Therefore, the goal of this proposal is to assess the matrix remodeling, mechanical properties, thrombosis, and IH of our endothelialized, biomimetic, and compliance matched TEVG using both an in-vitro and in-vivo approach. This goal will be met by completing the following specific aims. Specific Aim 1: Fabricate a layered TEVG that is compliance matched to a rat aorta and an ovine carotid artery using our established experimental/computational optimization approach. Specific Aim 2: Determine the compliance, load dependent ECM organization, and protease activity of our cell seeded TEVGs as TGF?2 is released during mechanically stimulated bioreactor culture. Specific Aim 3: Determine the compliance (in-vivo), patency, thrombogenicity, IH, and ex-vivo load dependent microstructure and mechanical properties of TGF?2 eluting and compliance matched TEVGs. Specific Aim 4: Assess the patency, thrombogenicity, IH, and ex-vivo load dependent microstructure and mechanical properties of TGF?2 eluting and compliance matched TEVGs lined with ECs derived from autologous adult versus autologous umbilical cord blood following ovine carotid implantation. Successful completion of the proposed aims will result in a TEVG that immunocompatible, antithrombogenic, and maintains it's compliance matched mechanical properties following implantation. The proposed research will also generate novel information regarding the extracellular matrix remodeling of biopolymer based vascular grafts as they remodeled both in-vitro and in-vivo."
"9377511","PROJECT SUMMARY  Due to significant advances in the treatment of pediatric cancer patients, the five year survival rate now exceeds 80% in the USA. Among the myriad long-term physical and psychosocial effects of treatment, reproductive dysfunction is reported as a major concern and is highly correlated with quality of life in this population. The etiology of reproductive dysfunction in childhood cancer survivors (CCS) is complex and few predictors of this effect of treatment have been identified. High levels of psychological stress have also been observed in CCS; psychological stress activates the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, which can suppress hypothalamic-pituitary gonadal function and disrupt reproductive function. The proposed research project will examine ovarian function in survivors of childhood cancer, a population at increased risk of reproductive dysfunction due to late effects of cancer treatment and psychological stress. The specific aims are (aim 1) to explore the relationship between perceived stress, biomarkers of HPA activity, gonadotropin levels, and anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH); and (aim 2) to determine the model that best explains the relationship between the most salient variables identified in aim 1. This cross-sectional cohort study will enroll 50 female patients between the ages of 16 and 35 who were treated for childhood cancer at the Edinburgh Children?s Cancer Centre, Royal Hospital for Sick Children. Perceived stress will be measured using the Perceived Stress Scale-10. HPA activity will be measured using salivary and hair cortisol and salivary IL-6. Ovarian function will be measured using serum gonadotropin levels, serum AMH levels, and menstrual cycle characteristics, which are collected routinely during the subject?s annual follow-up visit. Biological samples will be analyzed using commercially available ELISA kits in the Queen?s Medical Research Institute. For aim 1, data will be analyzed using linear regression models using a best-subset variable selection procedure and aim 2 will employ nonlinear models to determine the model that best explains the relationship between variables identified from the analysis of aim 1.The findings from this study will increase our understanding of AMH as a biomarker of reproductive function, especially ovarian function. The sponsors are experienced mentors and experts in ovarian function (Anderson) and laboratory assessment of biomarkers (McCarthy). While conducting this study, the applicant will attend weekly seminars on reproductive physiology. This training program will prepare the applicicant to conduct cutting edge research on biobehavioral processes affecting ovarian aging."
"9416834","In 1927, Norris described individuals with low blood pressure (BP) as persons who lacked stamina, tired easily, complained of cold extremities and showed an inability to do prolonged mental or physical work; he was quoted as saying; they are not exactly ill; yet they are rarely well. 1 However, several more recent papers have challenged the notion that low BP is a health concern, and even suggest that hypotension is the ideal normal BP.2, 3 Individuals with spinal cord injury (SCI) above T5 are reported to struggle with chronic hypotension,4-11 episodic orthostatic hypotension (OH) 12-16 and post-prandial hypotension.17 In fact, we recently reported that, over the course of a typical 24-hour day, the incidence of hypotension was as high as 70% in those with cervical lesions.18 In addition our unpublished data suggest that the incidence of hypotension is 2.5 fold increased in veterans with SCI compared to age-matched veterans without SCI. However, chronic hypotension is often not clinically addressed because the vast majority of hypotensive individuals remain asymptomatic. That said there evidence in the general medical literature supporting associations between asymptomatic hypotension, cognitive deficits, adverse changes in mood and quality of life (QOL). Compared to normotensive age-matched controls, otherwise healthy subjects with chronic asymptomatic hypotension are reported to have slowed cognitive speed, 19 fewer word recall, 20 decreased accuracy of response,21 limited attention,20 prolonged reaction times,19, 21, 22 and reduced memory and concentration capacity. 21, 22 In addition, several papers have reported findings suggesting significant associations between chronic hypotension and increased incidence of depression,23-30 anxiety,25, 26 unexplained tiredness,24, 31 and poor perception of well being.32 Although many hypotensive individuals with chronic SCI remain asymptomatic and do not raise clinical suspicion warranting intervention, we believe, and have demonstrated that asymptomatic chronic hypotension has adverse cognitive consequences.33-35 It must be appreciated that the superimposition of cognitive impairment on the physical, social and emotional limitations already experienced by many individuals with SCI may severely impact autonomy and social independence thereby diminishing QOL.36, 37 There is compelling evidence in the general medical literature suggesting that elevation in systemic BP, following midodrine hydrochloride administration, increases resting cerebral blood flow (CBF) and improves CBF responses to cognitive testing resulting in better test performance in healthy individuals with chronic hypotension. 38, 39 Because it is believed that the etiology of hypotension in the SCI population is the result of adrenergic insufficiency, midodrine, an alpha-adrenergic agonist, is considered a first line treatment, 40-42 and we have demonstrated significant increases in systemic BP in hypotensive individuals with SCI.43, 44 However, in general, data describing the BP effect of midodrine have been collected in small samples of hypotensive subjects with SCI during laboratory observations,44, 45 the benefit of sustained elevation in systemic BP on CBF, cognitive function, mood and QOL has not been rigorously studied in the SCI population. Data generated in this pilot project will be used to power a large-scale clinical trial to determine the clinical benefit of sustained increases in BP on CBF, cognitive function, mood and QOL in persons with SCI."
"9346863","Principal Investigators for Small Business: DiscoveryBioMed, Inc. (DBM) Project Summary Abstract The over-arching goal of this proposed SBIR-driven program is to create relevant DiscoveryBioMed (DBM) human cellular toxicity (HCT) platforms for the kidney grown in 3D and in 2D cell culture formats for a new ?gold standard? in lead therapeutic asset and materials in vitro testing and to reduce markedly the need for and the number of animals used in preclinical testing. Primary cultures of different human cell types from renal tissue will be utilized in these cellular toxicity platforms. Renal toxicity has arisen surprisingly late in preclinical development for several high profile biopharmaceutical drugs and biologics in recent efforts. It is apparent that the current methods and standards for preclinical toxicity testing require improvement. Recently, DBM launched a new Online Store and offers 2D tissue culture (TC) plastic-grown human cell platforms of kidney, lung, skin and the vasculature for HCT testing. To build upon these initial offerings, DBM seeks to design and establish 3D cell mono-culture and co-culture platforms for human kidney cells, so as to deepen the creativity and innovation of our Online Store offerings. In addition to preliminary data generated on 2D cell culture platforms, DBM has begun to establish and optimize 3D Biogel-based culture platforms where normal renal epithelial cells form tubule-like and duct-like structures, along with spherical fluid-filled cysts. Moreover, DBM has established 3D ?barrier? co-culture platforms where polarized human renal epithelial cell monolayers form on permeable filter supports and where vascular endothelial cells or other relevant cell types on grown immediately beneath the epithelium. Preliminary designs and results will be shared. In addition to the establishment of such 3D cell culture platforms, DBM wishes to test important hypotheses. First, do any FDA- approved drugs, known industry standard drugs, or drugs currently in clinical trials display cellular toxicity in DBM?s kidney HCT testing platforms? Second, does DBM?s HCT approach have more value when human cells are studied in 3D cell culture formats vs. 2D formats? DBM has been hesitant to pursue this line of research since defined HCT is not yet the ?gold standard? for lead therapeutic asset toxicity testing as mandated by the FDA or other regulatory agencies. It is DBM?s view that this needs to change, so as to save time, resources, and animal lives that are wantonly wasted on a drug or biologic that could be identified early as harmful with DBM?s HCT. Our milestones that DBM wishes to meet include: to offer existing 2D HCT testing platforms for kidney so as to begin to change the culture and methods used to ensure the safety of lead therapeutic assets; to design new 3D HCT testing platforms for kidney and renal vasculature; to optimize and test new 3D HCT testing platforms for kidney and renal vasculature versus existing 2D HCT testing platforms; and, finally, to explore microfluidics ?chip?-based 3D HCT testing platforms for kidney and renal vasculature.

"9377478","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Aerobic exercise is thought to promote healthy brain aging and to attenuate cognitive decline in seniors, and may protect from neurodegenerative disorders like Alzheimer's dementia (AD). AD is characterized by a profound pathology of the hippocampus (HC) and entorhinal cortex, two brain regions that are critical for episodic memory formation. In animal models, aerobic exercise has been shown to increase the number of adult-born hippocampal neurons. In turn, newborn neurons have been shown to improve learning and memory. Studies in humans have shown that better aerobic fitness is associated with greater performance on memory tasks in both young and older adults, but this has yet to be studied in middle-aged adults. Given the increasing prevalence of AD, research has focused on preclinical stages, prior to emergence of cognitive symptoms. In this context, examining the middle-age range is crucial, because it may be the beginning of subtle cognitive or brain changes predictive of future AD. Additionally, neuroprotective interventions may be most successful the earlier they are implemented. The goal of the proposed project is to determine the neurobiological mechanisms of hippocampal-related plasticity from a cognitive neuroscience perspective by focusing on the hippocampal subfields, which are known to be negatively affected by aging, and elucidate how fitness may modulate these mechanisms across adulthood. Aim 1 of this proposal focuses on determining the effects of aging on the behavioral capacity to disambiguate overlapping stimuli during memory formation cross-sectionally throughout adulthood. The goal of Aim 2 is to elucidate how the relationship between task performance and age may be modulated by objectively assessed aerobic fitness. Aim 3 focuses on hippocampal subfield function associated with memory formation. Aim 3 will utilize high-resolution fMRI and data-driven analytic approaches uniquely suited for detecting subtle functional changes within hippocampal subfields. Training goals include gaining expertise in 1) state-of-the-art exercise physiology methods, and developing skills in 2) experimental design for behavioral and fMRI experiments, and 3) novel data-driven approaches to analysis. The central research hypotheses are that age will be positively associated with increased performance variability during the middle age range (Aim #1), that this performance variability will interact with fitness (Aim #2), and that aerobic fitness will also modulate hippocampal activation patterns underlying memory formation (Aim #3). This research project will enhance the knowledge of the effects of early aging on hippocampal plasticity and will set a foundation from which to identify individuals who may benefit from early neuroprotective interventions."
"9446470","Project Summary/Abstract: The incidence of both Alzheimer?s disease and related dementias (AD) and of breast cancer increases with age; thus, many older women with AD are faced with questions about breast cancer screening. Having AD impacts a woman?s life expectancy and their ability to participate in her medical decision-making about breast cancer screening. As a result, AD family caregivers are frequently involved in making decisions about mammography. Each year over 800,000 older women with AD receive screening mammography. Caregivers cite decision-making and procedures related to mammograms as particularly stressful and there is no data that mammography screening helps women with AD live longer or better. No randomized trials evaluating the benefits and harms of mammography screening include women with AD and current guidelines recommend not screening women with a life expectancy of <10 years. The rationale is that these women will not live long enough to experience the life prolonging benefits of mammography screening. Instead, screening these women can put them at risk for physical and psychological harm as a result of overdiagnosis, overtreatment, additional tests due to false positives, and the identification of clinically unimportant cancer. Conversely, while mammography screening may not help older women with AD live longer, it may help find breast cancers earlier when they are easier to treat. Therefore, it is important that women with AD and their caregivers have information to make an informed decision about screening. Decision aids have promise to improve the quality of medical decision-making for patients with AD and inform family caregivers about the risks, benefits, and choices about screening mammography in this population. Our team has created and evaluated a mammogram decision aid for use with caregivers of older women with AD. This decision aid includes specific information about the relationship between life expectancy with AD and benefit from mammograms, the impact of mammography on quality of life for older women with AD, and a recognition of the emotions and experience of caregivers when making decisions about mammography for a relative with AD. We are proposing the Decisions about Cancer screening in Alzheimer's Disease (DECAD) study, as the first study to test if an evidence-based decision aid for AD caregivers can support decision-making about mammography and improve the quality of medical decision-making about breast cancer screening. This large randomized controlled trial will recruit 426 dyads of older women with AD and a family caregiver from 24 primary care practices in central Indiana to test this decision aid."
"9446191","Abstract The central nervous system (CNS) acquires its vasculature by angiogenesis, a process that is critical for its development and repair. Our work has changed notions of cerebral vascularization which implied that blood vessels sprout passively into the brain parenchyma from pial vascular plexuses to meet metabolic needs of growing neuronal populations or treated endothelial cells of the CNS as a homogenous population. Based on origins, anatomical location, independent growth patterns and developmental regulation, forebrain vascular networks fall into two categories: pial and periventricular. The periventricular vascular network that develops in advance of and independent of neuronal development is strategically positioned to provide support and critical guidance cues to instruct neurogenesis and GABAergic interneuron migration in the developing telencephalon. These findings offer new solutions for transplanted primary neuronal precursors that are unable to migrate and integrate into regions requiring new neurons in the absence of proper guidance mechanisms. This application will explore this novel paradigm of neurovascular interactions in diverse ways. It will identify novel angiogenesis mechanisms underlying the origin and etiology of neuropsychiatric diseases. It aims to highlight the novel concept that endothelial GABA signaling is indispensable for brain development shaping postnatal and adult behavior. It attempts to rescue abnormal vascular GABA signaling during embryonic development as a therapeutic approach for long-lasting mental health outcomes. It will examine whether periventricular?like human endothelial cells promote human GABAergic neuronal migration to facilitate development of novel cell based therapies for GABA-related diseases. Results will have far-reaching effects on concepts and mechanisms of regulation of angiogenesis, offer new perspectives on telencephalic histogenesis principles and will lead to discoveries with unprecedented implications for regenerative medicine and treatment of many neurological and psychiatric diseases."
"9347688","SUMMARY Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a leading contributor to death and disability in the USA, yet widely effective treatments remain elusive and, except for a lengthy program of rehabilitation, no effective treatment for TBI is available. Therefore, there is a critical need in new therapeutic approaches which can maximally preserve brain tissue and facilitate functional recovery after TBI. In the last two decades substantial efforts have been invested in developing medicines for TBI, but these efforts have not resulted in clinically-efficacious therapies. These failures highlight the need for development of new therapeutic ideas and approaches for reducing neuronal injury secondary to TBI. Among possible strategies, effective treatments with broad therapeutic windows are likely to be the most valuable because of the unexpected events leading to brain trauma. Our data presented indicate that activation of ?7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) can significantly reduce brain injury following TBI. A novel therapeutic paradigm has been introduced that converts endogenous choline/ACh into potent therapeutic agents after brain trauma by inhibiting ?7 nAChR desensitization using Type-II positive allosteric modulators (i.e. PAMIIs), such as PNU120596. Our data demonstrate that PNU120596 administered intravenously after controlled cortical impact (CCI) significantly reduces brain injury and astrogliosis in rats and suggest that novel PAM II agents represent a therapeutic opportunity in TBI. Our efforts to discover novel entities has produced EPGN1137, a compound with suitable potency in the reactivation of ?7 nAChRs, drug-like characteristics, and which demonstrates preliminary efficacy in a related model of ischemic stroke. A plan to test Epigen candidate PAM IIs in CCI models of TBI includes: A) Re- synthesis of novel candidate molecules with appropriate ?7 nAChR reactivation efficacy, B) a detailed pharmacokinetic assessment of the PAM II candidates to design dosing schedules for efficacy studies; and C) an evaluation of efficacy in the CCI model of TBI. We expect to identify at least one PAM II with suitable efficacy that may be progressed into pre-clinical development or define criteria for the selection of lead PAM II candidates."

A K23 will allow me to establish a clinical research program to enhance prognostication and improve holistic care for patients with choroidal melanoma. The proposed research and training will provide the foundation for an R01/UG1 proposal to develop an international ocular melanoma registry, fostering multi-center comparative studies with large datasets. My long-term career goals are to: 1) lead a multidisciplinary ocular oncology team at University of California, San Francisco (UCSF); 2) create a prospective database of clinical outcomes, molecular pathology data and patient- reported outcomes (PROs) to predict ocular outcomes, survival and quality of life (QOL); 3) advance randomized trials and multicenter collaboration in ocular oncology, to advance diagnostics and therapeutics. My training objectives are to: 1) master advanced biostatistics methodology, database management and study design through didactic courses and apprenticeships, working with renowned mentors in ocular oncology, molecular pathology and statistics; 2) understand molecular diagnostics in uveal melanoma and how to evaluate new prognostic and diagnostic tests in clinical practice, through mentored laboratory experiences with a pre-eminent molecular pathologist; 3) engage in multidisciplinary research, in collaboration with international colleagues, forming connections for future multi-center studies; and 4) become proficient in scientific writing. The specific aims of this project are to: 1) develop and validate prognostic models for predicting visual outcome, local tumor control and ocular conservation after proton beam radiotherapy for choroidal melanoma. We will test the hypothesis that radiation dosimetry predicts such outcomes better than baseline clinical features. 2): validate a targeted next-generation genetic sequencing (NGS) assay as a prognostic test for survival in choroidal melanoma. We hypothesize that NGS of choroidal melanoma reliably determines tumor lethality. 3): develop prognostic models for predicting PROs and QOL after proton beam radiotherapy for choroidal melanoma. We hypothesize that social factors are more predictive than ophthalmic features in determining PROs and QOL We will perform secondary analysis of an existing dataset of patients treated at the Liverpool Ocular Oncology Centre, mostly by the primary mentor (BD), to create and validate the prognostic models, which we will then evaluate in a cohort of patients at UCSF."
"9336892","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hunger selectively enhances attention to food-associated cues, which can lead to excessive eating and obesity. Our lab seeks to establish a genetic mouse model to examine the neural pathways underlying hunger- dependent attention to food-cues. Our proposed circuit includes neurons expressing agouti-related protein (AgRP) in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus (sensing internal state), the amygdala (updating the value of sensory cues and encoding motivational salience), and the higher visual cortical areas that receive selective amygdalar input (object recognition). Our proposed model for hunger-dependent attention is that hypothalamic AgRP neuron activity mirrors a drive to seek food. The amygdala integrates these interoceptive cues with exteroceptive cues about the sensory environment (via inputs from higher visual cortical areas) to identify motivationally relevant cues in the environment and allocate additional sensory processing to these cues. I hypothesize that as the hunger state of the animal changes, so does the motivational relevance or `value' of food-cues, a process dependent on activity in both the hypothalamus and the amygdala. In support of this, in a large number of human neuroimaging studies, the amygdala and ventral visual cortical areas that receive amygdalar input consistently show increased responses to visual food cues during hungry, but not sated, states, an effect likely due to indirect hypothalamic (and possibly direct hormonal) influences on these areas. These studies, however, lack the cellular resolution to dissect the basic microcircuits involved in hunger- dependent attention. Unlike in human neuroimaging studies, our studies in behaving mice involve the simultaneous recording, at single cell resolution, of genetically-identified neurons, across natural and induced states of hunger. I will examine two nodes in our proposed circuit. In Aim 1, I will use electrophysiological recordings in optogenetically-defined classes of neurons in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus to measure state-dependent neural responses to food-associated and neutral visual cues. In Aim 2, I will use two-photon calcium imaging to measure the state-dependent neural responses of amygdala axons projecting to higher visual cortex in an identical task. Our preliminary data suggests that, both AgRP cells and the amygdalar projections to higher visual cortex show hunger-dependent neural biases to food-cues. Finally, I will determine the contribution of hypothalamic pathways in hunger-dependent attention to food-cues by testing whether optogenetic stimulation of AgRP neurons, a manipulation known to drive food-seeking behavior, is sufficient to recapitulate neuronal biases to food-cues (Aim 3). In this way, I can begin to define the relationship between circuits underlying the drive to seek food, and those translating this drive into selective cognitive processing of specific sensory cues. In summary, my proposal will dissect the neural pathways from hypothalamus to cortex important for hunger-dependent attention to food cues, and provide an important step towards the rational design of novel therapies for reducing over-attention and addiction to highly palatable foods."

"9485170","Abstract: Investigator Development Core The Center for American Indian and Alaska Native Health Disparities is devoted to improving the health and quality of life of AI/AN people and offers a supportive environment for health disparities research that aligns with the mandates of the this RFA. Responding to the recalcitrant disparities documented by Healthy People 2020, the Pilot Projects funded by this Investigator Development Core (IDC) will address underserved populations, emphasizing our theme of Alzheimer's disease and related disorders (ADRDs) within a Precision Medicine (PM) framework. The IDC is designed to identify and allocate substantial funding to support Pilot Projects that can affect sustained, widespread reductions in ADRD health disparities of all kinds by a) conducting analyses using existing datasets that include adequate numbers of minority or underserved individuals; 2) rigorously testing practices, treatments, educational efforts, and policies; and c) conducting qualtitative work that illuminates quantitative or administrative findings or comprises formative science. Led by Drs. Spero Manson and William Henderson, a well regarded, highly experienced biostatistician, we will facilitate the career success of Pilot Project investigators by offering grant-writing workshops that provide guidance from highly successful senior scientists and sophisticated design, methodologic, analytic, and research review services. Together, these integrated activities will helppostdoctoral/post-residency trainees, junior faculty, and early stage investigators (collectively called junior investigators) obtain external funding, such as mentored K Awards, R01 series grants, and other mechanisms appropriate to their career level. This Core will offer numerous possibilities for ADRD and PM research, including studies of the etiology, biology, genetics, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of ADRDs and their clinical, psychosocial, and economic consequences. We will leverage the successful experience of our other, existing pilot fund and research career development programs to rapidly develop application procedures and selection criteria. Notably, we will recruit a broad range of investigators from UCD/AMC w can begin or augment their research with IDC support. Given serious concerns about the dearth of minority Principal Investigators (PIs), we will ho actively solicit applications from AI/AN and other underrepresented minority (URM) junior investigators, using personal contact, word of mouth, minority-serving institutional units, email, and other effective means to achieve this goal."
"9446364","7. Project Summary/Abstract There is a significant revolving door of incarceration among homeless adults, a population with substantial health disparities. Homeless adults who receive the professional coordination of individualized care (i.e., case management) during the period following their release from jail experience fewer mental health and substance use problems, are more likely to obtain stable housing, and are less likely to be re-incarcerated. This is because case managers work to meet the various needs of their clients by helping them to overcome barriers to needed services (e.g., food, clothing, housing, job training, substance abuse and mental health treatment, medical care, medication, social support, proof of identification, legal aid). Many barriers (e.g., limited transportation, inability to schedule appointments, limited knowledge of available services) prevent homeless adults who were recently released from incarceration from obtaining available case management, crisis management, substance abuse, and mental health services. The proposed study will use mobile technology to address these barriers and fill gaps in the understanding of the causes of the revolving door of homeless incarceration. Specifically, 432 homeless adults who enroll in a shelter based Homeless Recovery Program after release from county jail will be randomly assigned to one of three treatment groups: 1) usual shelter based case management (UCM), 2) UCM plus a study provided smart phone (UCM+SP), and 3) UCM with a study provided smart phone that is preloaded with an innovative care management app (SPCM). The SPCM app is an extension of the research team's previous successful work using mobile devices to assess and modify health behaviors in low income and homeless adults. Those assigned to SPCM will receive smart phones that will prompt (twice weekly) connections to shelter based case managers. The app will also offer direct links to care managers (available during normal business hours) and crisis interventionists (available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week), with the touch of a button. It is hypothesized that SPCM will increase utilization of case and crisis management services thereby addressing unmet needs (e.g., alcohol/drug/mental health counseling), improve perceived social support and quality of life, and reduce homelessness and re-arrest. Another key focus of this study is to address gaps in the understanding of mechanisms that drive re-arrest and homelessness by using traditional in-person (i.e., baseline, 1, 3, and 6 months post-baseline) and smart phone based (i.e., daily for 6 months) assessment methods to identify distal and proximal predictors (e.g., affect, thoughts, behaviors, events) of continued homelessness and arrest. This research represents a step toward integrated service connection and healthcare service provision for one of the most underserved, high need, and understudied populations in the United States. Smart phone apps that increase the use of available healthcare services and identify predictors of key outcomes could be used to reach hard to reach populations with histories of significant and persistent health disparities (e.g., homeless adults)."
"9544378","Consortium for large-scale production and phenotyping of knockout mice (UM1) ABSTRACT: The long-term goal of the International Knockout Mouse Consortium (IKMC) is to develop a resource of targeted mutations in mice for every protein-coding gene in the mammalian genome that the research community can use to elucidate gene function in human biology and disease. We have formed a consortium of two Institutes (Baylor College of Medicine and MRC Harwell). This application describes our plan to generate null alleles for 1500 mouse genes using CRISPR/RGN genome editing technology and validate each line using established QC procedures. We will cryopreserve all mutant strains and deliver germplasm to the MMRRC repositories. These mutant alleles represent a gold standard resource of mutant alleles for the wider community, and an important foundation for future research and translational studies using the mouse models created. We will perform broad-based adult phenotyping on all mutant lines, and for the first time incorporate an ageing component for a significant fraction of mutants, the latter involving an additional testing component from 12 months onwards. We will also assess homozygous lethal and subviable lines in an embryonic phenotyping pipeline, It is apparent that there is a relationship of mouse lethal (essential) and subviable genes with human disease loci. All allele and phenotype data will be submitted in real time to the Data Coordination Center, ensuring that all of the BasH data is disseminated to the wider biomedical scientific community. We will continue our R&D program to introduce appropriate methodological and technological developments from production to phenotyping. BasH will continue to pilot improvements in Cas9 RGN for the production of more sophisticated alleles, and in parallel ensure that developments in cryopreservation approaches at Baylor and Harwell are integrated into the production pipeline. We will also continue our major projects in improving and enriching the adult and embryo phenotyping pipelines, focusing on areas such as metabolomics, behavioral phenotyping and home cage monitoring, with the aim of providing more complex and longitudinal data. Baylor College of Medicine and MRC Harwell have the established expertise, experience, and resources to efficiently and cost-effectively meet this goal."
"9377253","Project Summary  Regulation of gene expression plays a key role in the cellular response to environmental damage by increasing the levels of specific stress response proteins. Recent tRNA modification, codon usage and proteomic studies provide support for the idea that stress promotes changes in the levels of enzyme-modified nucleosides found in the anticodon of some tRNA's to regulate the translation of stress-response transcripts with specific codon usage patterns. In bacteria the tRNA modification enzyme 2-selenouridine synthetase (SelU) has the potential to be exploited to develop new antibiotics, as SelU is essential in response to stress, unique to bacteria and adds a hydrophobic moiety, not found in humans, to the anticodon wobble uridine. In this application we propose to characterize stress-induced changes in SelU- dependent tRNA modifications and determine if regulation of translation elongation in bacteria is linked to tRNA modification and codon-usage patterns. Our studies in bacteria have the potential to demonstrate that specific tRNA modifications can promote and also restrict the translation of differing groups of codon-biased transcripts. Translational restriction would be a novel finding and could be linked to the observation that bacteria contain some unique RNA modifications when compared to eukaryotes. In contrast to eukaryotes, bacteria use 2-thiourdine (s2) as a substrate. Specifically SelU uses geranylphosphate to convert s2U to a geranylated wobble uridine (ges2U) in tRNAGlu, tRNAGln and tRNALys. SelU can also use selenophosphate to produce 2-selenouridine (se2U). Both ges2U and se2U are also found in the terminal modification 5- methylaminomethyl-2-geranylthioluridine (mnm5ges2U) and 5-methylaminomethyl-2-selenouridine (mnm5se2U), with mnm5 provided by another modification pathway. We have synthesized ges2U and se2U and used thermal denaturation and simulations to show that geranylation promotes wobble uridine pairing with guanine, while restricting pairing with adenine. We have used codon analytics of all E. coli and P. aerogenosis genes to identify codon-biased transcripts. Together with our observed stress sensitivity of E. coli ?selU cells, the data support the idea the ges2U and se2U modifications levels change in response to stress. Based on our studies we propose to test the hypothesis that the two SelU-based wobble uridine modifications in bacterial tRNA are dynamically regulated in response to environmental stress and can be used to positively- or negatively- regulate the translation of specific transcripts corresponding to stress response and metabolic enzymes, respectively. There is abundant s2U modified tRNA in human cells but its analysis is understudied, due to the absence of essential tools. Because SelU and ges2U are unique to bacteria and geranylphosphate is a 10-carbon chain, they have the potential to be exploited to label specific s2U-modified tRNAs in human cells. Thus we will test the hypothesis that SelU can be exploited to generate an s2U-based labeling reagent for use in epitranscriptomic studies of human cells."
"9565793","Abstract The overarching goal of this proposal is to develop innovative statistical methods for Electronic Health Record (EHR) based research. Clinically relevant information from the EHR permits the derivation of a rich collection of phenotypes. Unfortunately, since the data is primarily collected for clinical rather than research purposes, the true status of any given individual with respect to the trait of interest is not necessarily known. A common study design is to use structured clinical data elements to identify case and control groups on which subsequent analyses are based. To minimize identification error, a common practice is that separate, but complimentary, rules are developed to select individuals for the case and control groups, with case selection rules emphasizing a high positive predictive value (PPV), and control selection rules emphasizing a high negative predictive value (NPV). The accuracy of control identification is usually high as the sheer number of available controls permits overly restrictive definition constructed to insure a high NPV. In contrast, contamination by subjects who are not cases plagues case selection, as the need to have adequate sample size, and by extension power, must be balanced against the probability that those selected truly have the trait of interest. We call these non-cases ?ineligibles? because they do not satisfy the definition of controls. Ignoring inaccuracy in case identification by treating ineligibles as true cases can lead to biased analysis. No statistical methods yet exist for addressing the bias resultant from this unique challenge of case contamination in EHR-based case-control studies. In particular, statistical methods for the classical misclassification problem where labels for cases and controls are switched are not applicable. The current standard practice limits analysis to a further selected subset with high PPV, which may have practically ignorable bias but not efficient. This proposal aims to fill in this gap by developing efficient statistical methods when ?gold standard? case versus non-case status is available from medical chart review for a validation subset of candidate cases. Our methods, accompanied by comprehensive and user-friendly software, will offer researchers a rich arsenal of statistical methods and tools for analyzing EHR data."
"9386292","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT As Parkinson's Disease (PD) progresses, the symptoms of this debilitating and costly condition increase in number and severity, quality of life declines, and caregiver strain rises, resulting in 100-200,000 US patients becoming homebound. This population loses access to care despite overwhelming need. Evidence supports interdisciplinary and home-based models of care in other elderly cohorts, and the use of telehealth in earlier stages of PD; however, none of these have been formally tested in advanced PD. The long-term goals of this K23 are 1) to develop the candidate into a leader in the fields of movement disorders and health services research, and 2) to develop, test, and disseminate models of care and related interventions to improve access to care, quality of care, and quality of life for patients with advanced PD and their caregivers. The aims of this project are 1) to test the efficacy of an interdisciplinary home visit program for patients with advanced PD on patient quality of life and caregiver strain when compared with usual care; 2) to compare the effects of home visits with and without caregiver peer mentoring on caregiver health; and 3) to conduct a budget impact analysis of the model. We will prospectively study 60 patient-caregiver pairs matched with subjects receiving usual care within the National Parkinson Foundation Parkinson's Outcome Project (POP); we will enroll 36 experienced past caregivers as peer mentors. The K23 candidate is an Assistant Professor of Neurology and Population Health at New York University School of Medicine, and completed a movement disorders fellowship and NINDS T32-supported Master's of Science in Clinical Epidemiology at the University of Pennsylvania. She has conducted clinical and health services research in geriatrics, neurology, and PD, identifying health literacy and medication beliefs as barriers to care. She has demonstrated the feasibility of a pilot interdisciplinary home visit program for homebound individuals with PD. The candidate is committed to a career in patient-oriented research and proposes an comprehensive five-year plan of mentorship, formal training, self-directed learning, and research. She will develop expertise and skills in: 1) Implementation and dissemination science; 2) Comparative and cost effectiveness research; and 3) Palliative care skills and research. The results of this K23 will inform future R01 applications that will test the efficacy and cost effectiveness of this model for advanced PD in other settings, and adapt this model to other chronic neurologic conditions. By identifying, testing, and disseminating effective therapies and models of care for this previously understudied population, we can minimize morbidity and unnecessary healthcare utilization. Dr. Fleisher's mentorship team includes expertise in PD, implementation and dissemination of interdisciplinary care models, telehealth, cost effectiveness, and the POP. The outstanding institutional support, and proposed training, career development, and research plans will ensure Dr. Fleisher's successful transition to an independent clinical investigator dedicated to improving the health outcomes of patients with advanced Parkinson's Disease and other neurodegenerative conditions."
"9333110","This study is a randomized controlled trial to investigate a novel treatment for patients with painful knee osteoarthritis. The study will recruit patients who have osteoarthritis isolated to the medial compartment of the knee. Half of the patients will participate in a gait retraining program to alter their foot placement during walking; the other half will be assigned to a self-directed walking group. Gait retraining will be subject-specific and will depend on a key feature of each subject's baseline gait, namely which peak (early or late) in the bi-modal knee adduction moment (KAM) profile is larger. The retraining will involve changing the foot progression angle, which is the angle the foot makes relative to the forward direction. The intervention will involve either increasing internal foot rotation (toe-in) or increasing external foot rotation (toe-out). Previously, toe-in has been shown to reduce only the first peak, whereas toe-out has been shown to reduce only the second peak. Because of the personalized intervention, we expect all retrained subjects will be able to reduce the (larger) peak KAM and to reduce knee pain. Based on previous studies, we expect that approximately 80% of subjects in the gait retraining group will need to increase toe-in, and 20% of subjects will need to increase toe-out.  Gait retraining will be done using a vibration feedback device taped to the lower leg as each subject walks on a treadmill. Body segment kinematics will be captured and ground reaction forces will be measured. During each step, subjects will receive vibration feedback informing them how they should change their foot progression angle during the next step. Real-time feedback facilitates training since an individual knows immediately whether their foot placement was correct or not, and they are informed via the feedback signal whether or not to change their foot angle during the next step. The gait retraining consists of once a week sessions for six weeks. The training uses a fading feedback approach, where the percentage of each weekly session during which feedback is used is decreased from week to week until no feedback is used by the last training session. At that point the new gait pattern is internalized and that new pattern then represents the new ?natural? gait pattern for each individual. Throughout the six-week training period subjects will be encouraged to practice their new gait for at least ten minutes per day. After the six-week training, subjects will continue to use their new gait. Subjects will undergo gait lab checks at weeks 21, 31 and 41 and monitoring of foot progression angle under free-living conditions using ?smart? shoes during weeks 8, 31 and 52 to assess retention, with refresher training if necessary. Their last assessment will be at 52 weeks.  Participants in the control group will receive an educational pamphlet developed by the Arthritis Foundation that describes the benefits of regular walking for those with arthritis. A self-directed walking program has be shown to provide pain relief for those with knee osteoarthritis, although we expect the patients who undergo gait retraining will have an additional benefit from a reduction in excessive forces on the medial compartment of the knee, thereby slowing disease progression.  All subjects will receive a monthly phone call to encourage maintaining a regular walking regimen for 52 weeks. The gait retraining group also will be reminded to focus on practicing their new gait pattern. For both groups, walking activity will be monitored for one week using an accelerometer- based pedometer during weeks 7, 31 and 52. All subjects will receive a Magnetic Resonance Imaging scan and weight-bearing knee radiographs at weeks 0 and 52 to assess knee cartilage composition and organization, and joint space, respectively. All participants will also complete clinical knee score questionnaires and visual analog pain scales at weeks 0, 7, 11, 31 and 52."
"9354451","The Wise App Trial for Improving Health Outcomes in PLWH Human Immunodeficiency virus (HIV) continues to affect 1.2 million Americans. Achieving viral suppression through adherence to antiretroviral (ART) therapy is a critical determinant of successful transmission prevention and long-term outcomes in HIV-infected patients. However only about 25% of persons living with HIV (PLWH) in the US are virally suppressed, demonstrating the need for effective interventions that enhance ART adherence. mHealth is a tool that has proven useful in supporting behavior change, but most mHealth tools for PLWH have not been well-developed or evaluated. Given the dearth of useful and likeable apps, the need for improving medication adherence in PLWH, and the great promise of mHealth, we propose to build and test a user-centered smartphone app linked to a smart pill box targeting ART adherence in PLWH. Self- report of medication adherence is often criticized since it typically overestimated adherence especially in unmasked trials. Current adherence assessments, such as patient recall, pill counts and pharmacy refill data, typically detect missed doses long after they occur. Our study will use real-time, wireless monitoring strategies via the Wisepill dispenser, for measuring ART adherence. This will overcome this often cited limitation and provide novel opportunities to proactively prevent virologic rebound and treatment failure. Guided by Fogg's Functional Triad for persuasive technology and building on our earlier user-centered design work, the proposed intervention has the potential to not only improve ART adherence in PLWH, but also have a sustainable public health impact. The aims of our study are to: (1) Build a functional app for HIV self- management linked to a smart pill box (Wise App) for PLWH and assess its usability; (2) Evaluate the impact of the Wise App on medication adherence in underserved PLWH; and (3) Assess PLWH perceptions of the predisposing, enabling, and reinforcing factors for Wise App use through theoretically-guided focus group sessions. The proposed study extends our preliminary work that employed user-centered design methods to identify the content, features, functionalities, and interface of a mobile app to improve health outcomes in PLWH. The user-centered design app we will build will then be linked to a smart pill box so that PLWH can receive feedback on their adherence behaviors. Our study intervention, the Wise App, is relevant, timely, of public health import, and supported by substantial preliminary work. The proposed trial is significant in representing a principled and systematic effort to build, and test the efficacy of a smartphone intervention for ART adherence in PLWH in the US. Importantly, this work has broader implications and will improve our understanding of how to support patients' medication adherence, regardless of treatment target."
"9566396","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is a competing continuation proposal for Years 23-28 of the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) cooperative agreement, in response to NIA RFA #AG-12-001. We propose to continue core data collection on the steady-state design laid out in the two previous renewal cycles, and collect biomarkers and measures of physical performance in in-person interviews on the rotating half-sample design established in the previous cycle.        HRS provides a uniquely rich, nationally representative longitudinal dataset for the community of scientific and policy researchers who study the health, economics and demography of aging. It provides a research data base that can simultaneously support cross-sectional descriptions of the U.S. population over the age of fifty, longitudinal studies of a given cohort over a substantia period of time and research on cross-cohort trends. The HRS project creates a data system extending beyond the core survey data. One component of this extended data system consists of linkages to administrative data, including Social Security earnings and benefit records, Medicare utilization and diagnostic records, employer pension records, and the National Death Index. We plan to expand these linkages to include Medicaid records, links to Veteran's Administration data, and information on nursing home residents from the Minimum Data Set. Another component is genome-wide genotyping data from consenting respondents that will be available in dbGaP by the start of this next renewal cycle.        The HRS provides public use data designed to allow the full power and creativity of America's scientific community to address the challenges of an aging population. The HRS is making a significant impact on research on aging through investigator-initiated research which uses the HRS as an input without charge to researchers or granting agencies. Over 1,000 peer-reviewed journal publications by over 1,000 different authors and co-authors and over 200 doctoral dissertations have appeared based on the HRS."
"9565710","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Although sleep is generally believed to be essential for survival, the neuronal mechanisms by which it affects brain function are largely unknown. Does sleep constitute a passive state in which the brain is `quiet' or does it play an important role for network coding and behavior in subsequent tasks? Even though the functional significance of sleep is not well understood, the available data suggest that significant improvements in learning and memory are found even after brief naps. A critical issue for understanding sleep function is whether and how it impacts the accuracy of neuronal network computations to improve behavioral performance. We will address these issues for the first time by examining whether brief sleep (20 min of rest) influences visual perceptual performance and the coding of visual information across neuronal populations. We propose to use multiple-electrode recording simultaneously in two visual cortical areas (V1 and V4) of awake behaving monkey to examine the dynamics and coding in neuronal populations before, during, and after sleep, and their impact on perceptual performance. Aim 1 will examine how sensory experience changes the structure of network activity during rest by determining (i) how task exposure modifies the distribution of neuronal correlations across networks during rest, and (ii) if cells that are coactivated during stimulus exposure are more likely to be reactivated during subsequent rest. Aim 2 will examine whether brief sleep influences subsequent stimulus coding by individual neurons and networks by determining (i) whether single neuron discrimination performance is improved after rest, and (ii) whether and how correlated activity across the network is modified after rest. By decoding the population response we will determine (iii) whether neuronal populations encode more information after rest, and (iv) whether and how rest changes the synchrony between individual neurons and local population activity. Aim 3 will examine whether rest influences the relationship between neuronal and behavioral performance by determining (i) whether behavioral performance is improved after rest, (ii) whether the post-sleep neuronal and behavioral performance are correlated, (iii) whether LFP activity and spike-LFP synchronization during sleep are correlated with post-rest behavioral performance, (iv) whether there is a relationship between the amount of rest and the improvement in network and behavioral performance. Our research has the potential to advance our understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying rest and sleep and thus provide future solutions to ameliorate the detrimental effects of sleep disorder on cognitive performance, including practical applications for non-invasive neuronal prosthetic devices."
"9277105","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This continuation of project EB001889 will extend the functional capabilities of recipients of implanted neuroprostheses for restoring lower extremity function after spinal cord injury (SCI) by applying new nerve cuff electrodes that selectively activate fascicles within the human femoral and sciatic nerves to isolate knee extension for standing, and both hip flexion and ankle plantar/dorsiflexion for efficient stepping.  The new enabling technologies we will develop and deploy include the Compliant FINE (C-FINE), and an 8-channel nerve cuff module for the Networked Neuroprosthesis System (NNPS).  The C-FINE offers distinct advantages over earlier nerve cuff designs, including a shape that matches the native nerve morphology, a contoured stiffness profile for flexibility along the nerve's length, an simple layered construction suitable for micro- fabrication of higher density contact arrays.  This new neural interface will significantly simplify implant surgery and improve the performance of lower extremity neuroprostheses, while the new stimulation module for the NNPS will enable the realization of sophisticated systems employing multiple C-FINEs for advanced lower extremity functions.  We will implant C-FINEs on the femoral nerves proximal to branching of the innervation to the sartorius and individual heads of the quadriceps in three new recipients of standing systems based on our existing 16- channel implanted stimulators (IST-16).  We expect the superior selectivity of the C-FINE to allow independent activation of functionally distinct groups of axons innervating knee extensors and hip flexors.  This should maintain or improve the standing performance achieved with other electrodes by increasing the available stimulated knee extension strength, while simultaneously providing access to the nerves that control the hip flexion required for reciprocal stepping.  Active plantar/dorsiflexion with balanced inversion/eversion should also greatly improve the quality and speed of walking by injecting propulsive energy for forward progression, and enhancing foot-floor clearance of the swinging limb.  We will implant C-FINEs on the tibial and fibular nerves above the knee in three additional subjects, and exploit their selectivity to produce strong ankle plantar/dorsiflexion with balanced inversion/eversion with the new NNPS system.  The complex structure of the proximal sciatic nerve has prevented application of existing low-density nerve- based electrodes to the hamstring muscles, which are important for safe and standing and stepping.  We expect that a single nerve cuff electrode with high number of contacts located on the proximal sciatic nerve will be able to isolate and fully activate the individual hamstrings to provide strong hip extensio and knee flexion.  We will establish the feasibility of high density interfaces to the sciatic nerv in acute intraoperative tests, which will improve the performance and simplify the surgical implantation of future lower extremity neuroprostheses."
"9432849","Abstract Modern neuroscience relies heavily on tools to visualize the structure, and at times the function, of the nervous system. This includes tools that examine structure at the level of few nanometers (electron microscopy) to those that examine whole human brain (MRI). Between these extremes are approaches to examine cellular sub-compartments and organelles, cellular morphology, small-scale circuit organization, and whole rodent or drosophila brains. Through the Institutional Center Core Grant to Support Neuroscience Research program, we established at Harvard Medical School and Boston Children's Hospital a Center Imaging Core that supports research in our community directed at understanding the structure and function of the nervous system in healthy animals and in models of human disease. The core has been operational for approximately 6 years, and has facilitated or directly made possible research projects throughout our community. The core operates both turnkey systems for daily use, specialized microscopes for chronic, high-content, and high-throughput imaging, as well as custom pipelines for imaging at the highest resolution in tissue and cells. The core has been successful, supporting over 35 NINDS projects across 27 laboratories. For the upcoming grant period, we have expanded the set of microscopes available and have reorganized and simplified the administrative and technical support structure to increase efficiency. Beyond its research mission, the Center will also continue to serve as a nexus for collaborative interactions across neuroscience communities and an educational hub for learning about imaging technologies and approaches. Through the sustained development of this Center, we hope to continue to provide cost-effective and productive services to NINDS researchers while further deepening ties between these two vibrant neuroscience communities."
"9419583","Project Summary/Abstract: Health disparities in pediatric asthma persist, with Latino children demonstrating increased asthma morbidity. Middle school children have greater morbidity than children from any other age group, yet there are no school- based asthma management programs developed for this group. To address these gaps, we have developed and piloted a novel group-based intervention: ASMAS (Asthma Self-MAnagement in Schools) in two geographic areas with a high proportion of urban, Latino children with asthma: Providence, Rhode Island, and San Juan, Puerto Rico. ASMAS is a 4-session, peer-facilitated asthma self-management intervention specific to the school setting for Latino middle school (6th-8th graders) children. It is delivered by trained Latino High School Juniors and Seniors with asthma, adapts guidelines-based self-management to the urban school setting, and is consistent with Latino children's cultural backgrounds. In our pilot RCT, ASMAS improved asthma outcomes and self-management for the targeted groups. Our proposed approach involves a hybrid design including a large-scale randomized, controlled trial investigating the effect of ASMAS, and an evaluation of the implementation process to inform future plans to test ASMAS in additional urban settings. Our first aim is to evaluate the effects of ASMAS on asthma health outcomes (e.g., control, symptom free days, absences, lung function) and asthma self-management (skills, knowledge and self-efficacy, availability of rescue inhaler and action plan at school) in a sample of 432 Latino middle school children with asthma in Providence, RI and San Juan, PR (216 per site; 72 per condition). 6th to 8th grade middle schoolers will be enrolled then randomly assigned to 1) ASMAS, or 2) Asthma Education plus Child Health control condition, or 3) a no treatment control condition (9 groups of each condition per site; 8 children per group). Student and primary caregiver assessments will occur at baseline, end of treatment (directly following the intervention), and at three, 4-month post intervention follow-ups. Our second aim is to conduct a mixed-methods, multi-stakeholder process evaluation using the RE-AIM framework,48-50 with students, caregivers, HS Peers, school administrators and additional community stakeholders invested in supporting students' asthma care. We will begin to develop implementation strategies with key stakeholders to better prepare for future large-scale evaluation of the effectiveness of ASMAS and its implementation in additional urban centers. Relative to controls, over 1 year, we expect that ASMAS participants will have improved asthma outcomes and self- management. We also expect treatment effects on asthma outcomes will be mediated through changes in self- management in all children, and moderated by acculturative stress and language proficiency in RI children. The proposed work offers a critical opportunity to evaluate ASMAS for improving asthma outcomes for children at high risk on a larger-scale and to develop avenues for sustainability and future dissemination with state and community stakeholders."
"9459629","ABSTRACT The most frequent neurodegenerative disease is late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD). We have recently reported a novel subgroup of patients who have a particularly malignant form of rapidly progressive late-onset Alzheimer's disease (rpAD) with atypical clinical symptoms, a low frequency of the e4 allele of APOE gene, unique structural characteristics of beta amyloid and an amyloid proteome that is distinct from typical slowly progressive Alzheimer's disease (spAD). Based on our preliminary data, we hypothesize that the rapid rates of cognitive decline and variable spectrum of symptoms in rpAD arise from the interplay between differently structured amyloid beta and tau proteins, triggering divergent pathogenetic cascades on a distinct genetic background. Accordingly, this proposal will focus on the integrated investigation of (i) conformational structural characteristics of beta amyloid and tau proteins with novel biophysical tools, (ii) proteomic profiling of amyloid plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, astrocytes and neurons of rpAD versus spAD, and (iii) genetic determinants linked to rpAD. The ultimate goal of these studies is to advance our understanding of the molecular mechanims governing the propagation of toxic beta amyloid and tau protein aggregates in the brain and the impact of their conformations upon the AD phenotype in the context of specific risk genes. This insight is critical for efforts to characterize key factors responsible for the very rapid rate of cognitive decline in this subtype of AD and ultimately to novel therapeutic strategies to slow AD progression."
"9328449","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Disruption of gene expression regulation is thought to underlie up to 90% of congenital heart defects (CHD) and is a major contributor to adult-onset complex cardiovascular diseases (CVD). A major source of this disruption is germline DNA mutations that alter transcription factor binding sites in cis-regulatory elements such as enhancers. Although we have tools available to identify these mutations in a patient, we cannot reliably predict which genes? expression patterns may be affected by the mutation because enhancers are often located far from the genes they regulate. Through long-range DNA looping interactions that place an enhancer element in physical proximity with the target gene?s promoter, transcription factors bound to the enhancer are able to activate gene expression. Therefore, it is critical that we associate enhancer elements to their target genes in the context of heart development and understand the extent to which DNA mutations impair enhancer function. Aim 1 of this research proposal will utilize the genome-wide chromosome conformation capture method, promoter-capture Hi-C, to identify all long-range promoter interactions in induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), mesoderm precursors, and iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes. Integration of chromatin data for active enhancers will then enable identification and assignment of each enhancer to its target gene. Comparison of gene regulatory profiles during the course of the differentiation will enhance understanding of the regulatory logic underlying heart development and provide a map of DNA regions that, if harboring a mutation, may contribute to developmental heart defects and disease. Aim 2 of this research proposal involves the development of a novel metric to assess whether a distal DNA mutation alters gene expression. Promoter-capture Hi-C will be conducted in iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes for ten genetically distinct individuals. Extensive genotyping information for these individuals will then be used to assess the contribution of genetic variants to enhancer-promoter interaction strength. This information will enable us to better classify DNA mutations as potential modifiers of gene expression and has the advantage of not relying on gene expression measurements. Overall, these studies will provide a frame- work within which we can analyze genetic mutations and predict their effect on gene regulation in the context of both heart development and complex cardiovascular disease."
"9548323","Failure to label devices and therapeutics for children threatens public health. Performing adequate studies for pediatric labeling, however, poses many challenges. These include a limited number of eligible participants with the disease; study design and operational inefficiencies; ineffective stakeholder engagement; and lack of a robust, pediatric-specific global infrastructure for enrollment. To address this critical unmet need, we will develop the Global Pediatric Clinical Trials Network (G-PCTN), which will support the infrastructure to plan and execute pediatric clinical trials through collaboration with academia, industry, parent/patient advocacy groups, and government agencies. G-PCTN will serve as the coordinating resource for pediatric product development to improve the public health of children. We will utilize the partnership of a fully functioning pediatric clinical trials network and a collaboration of FDA, academic medical centers, industry, patient and family advocacy groups, professional societies and other stakeholders. Under the leadership of Principal Investigators (PIs) Drs. Daniel K. Benjamin, Jr. and Michael Cohen-Wolkowiez, we will establish 3 cores (Network Operations, Patient Engagement, and Scientific Oversight) and 5 clinical study groups that will focus on design, dosing, regulatory/pharmacy, network partnerships, and rare diseases. Both PIs bring complementary skills to lead the network including vision, clinical trial expertise, chairing of large clinical trials networks (National Institute of Child Health and Human Development Pediatric Trials Network, Clinical and Translational Science Awards Trial Innovation Center), industry, and government therapeutics development experience, regulatory strategy, and PK/PD modeling. Together, we will leverage our experience, capacity, regulatory knowledge, and track- record to establish the scientific, operational, and stakeholder engagement infrastructure to plan and complete pediatric clinical studies. We will focus on operational efficiencies and network sustainability with early, systematic, and integrative approaches to pediatric trials. G-PCTN will solidify and expand our established global research site network, employing its infrastructure and resources to support investigators, sponsors, patients, and trainees to conduct clinical trials in children. We will focus on the following specific aims 1) provide strategy and content expertise to increase the success of pediatric product development; 2) provide education and training on best practices, design, and execution of pediatric trials; and 3) establish and manage a sustainable network of sites to execute clinical trials in children. As a result of the efforts of our collaborative G-PCTN, we will establish the required infrastructure to efficiently conduct scientifically sound global pediatric clinical trials. This new infrastructure will be leveraged by different sponsors to generate regulatory-grade quality data and improve pediatric public health."
"9565803","Project Summary Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a relentlessly progressive and usually fatal disease, efficient therapies for which are mostly limited to lung transplantation. It is unclear why even in individuals with genetic risk factors, clinically important lung disease seldom manifests until the later decades of life and why many high risk individuals are spared. Recently, several groups of investigators have shown that tissue-resident alveolar macrophages originate from fetal monocytes and populate alveolar space soon after birth and maintain their population throughout the lifespan via self-renewal, without contribution from circulating adult bone marrow- derived monocytes. These ?tissue-resident alveolar macrophages reciprocally interact with cells in the alveolar epithelium to dampen the immune response to endogenous and environmental challenges in the lung, which can threaten gas exchange. However, in response to injury, when tissue-resident alveolar macrophages are depleted, bone marrow-derived monocytes are recruited to the lung where they differentiate into ?monocyte- derived? alveolar macrophages and orchestrate a pro-inflammatory response. Using unique tools we developed to unambiguously label tissue-resident and monocyte-derived alveolar macrophages in the lungs of mice, we show that monocytes are recruited to the lung during injury where they differentiate into monocyte- derived alveolar macrophages and persist for months after the original injury. To explore the role of monocyte- derived macrophages in humans with lung fibrosis, we have developed a systematic protocol to isolate macrophage populations and alveolar type II cells from the samples of the human lung obtained at the time of lung transplant for transcriptomic analysis and adoptive transfer studies into humanized mouse model. We will use these tools to test the hypothesis that the loss of tissue-resident alveolar macrophages and their replacement by monocyte derived-alveolar macrophages contributes to the enhanced susceptibility to fibrosis. Aim 1: To determine whether TR-AM or Mo-AM differentially contribute to the development of lung fibrosis. Aim 1.1: To test if cell ontogeny determines the response of alveolar macrophages to a subsequent profibrotic stimulus. Aim 1.2: To determine if the lung microenvironment at the time of lung repopulation programs Mo-AM to respond differently to a subsequent fibrotic challenge. Aim 2: To determine whether the contribution of alveolar macrophages to lung fibrosis is cell autonomous or is shaped by the local microenvironment of the fibrotic lung. Aim 2.1: To determine if TR-AM will retain their anti- inflammatory/non-fibrotic phenotype in a fibrotic lung microenvironment. Aim 2.2: To determine whether monocytes and/or alveolar macrophages from healthy donors and patients with IPF demonstrate cell- autonomous differences in gene expression and whether these persist over time."
"9387149","Abstract Quantitative imaging approaches are currently being standardized for clinical medicine by the Quantitative Imaging Biomarkers Alliance (QIBA). However, similar efforts for preclinical imaging do not exist although the need for standardization is even more pressing because of the high degree of diversity that exists in preclinical imaging hardware and software. Compared to clinical (human) imaging, the technical challenges are significantly more difficult for the optimization of mouse model quantitative imaging. The goal of this proposal is to design, optimize and apply preclinical quantitative imaging with micro-magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and micro- computed tomography (CT). Specifically, we will apply our quantitative imaging methods in a co- clinical trial which mirrors an on-going, multi-institutional, randomized phase II clinical trial that has a primary objective to investigate whether neoadjuvant radiotherapy combined with pembrolizumab followed by surgical resection and adjuvant pembrolizumab improves disease-free survival for patients with high-risk soft-tissue sarcoma of the extremity (undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma or dedifferentiated/pleomorphic liposarcoma) compared to radiotherapy alone followed by surgical resection. The trial aims to evaluate the 2- and 5-year recurrence-free survival and overall survival. MRI is used to assess the radiation treatment response and to plan for surgery. Chest CT is used during follow up to evaluate for distant tumor recurrence (lung metastases). For preclinical studies, we will use the Cre-loxP technology to generate primary sarcomas in the hind limb of mice. Our autochthonous tumor models closely mimic human soft tissue sarcomas in histologic appearance, gene expression, and clinical behavior, including lung metastasis development. For the metastatic tumor model, the primary tumor-bearing limb will be amputated and mice will be monitored for metastases. In our first specific aim, we will develop and optimize quantitative imaging with micro-MRI for primary soft tissue sarcoma tumors and micro-CT for lung metastases. We will follow similar methodologies proposed in the QIBA framework but adapted for small animal imaging. During the second aim, we will implement our optimized quantitative imaging methods in the co-clinical trial using our genetically engineered mouse models of sarcoma. We anticipate that radiotherapy with PD-1 inhibitors will improve metastasis-free survival. The preclinical experiments will provide greater understanding of mechanisms involved in these combined therapies and will inform future clinical trials. Finally, the last specific aim will focus on creating a web- accessible research resource for archiving and disseminating small animal imaging protocols and data. Imaging and biologic data, including pathology, will be robustly integrated for correlative studies. The expected outcome of this project is the standardization of micro-MRI and micro-CT preclinical imaging for cancer studies. This standardization will facilitate and guide the incorporation of small animal imaging into future pre- and co- clinical trials involving new therapeutic approaches to cancer treatment. Ultimately, reduced variability in preclinical imaging studies will improve the value of quantitative correlations established between pathophysiological biomarkers and imaging biomarkers."
"9455402","ABSTRACT Advances in immunotherapy have shown efficacy in various cancers. Immunotherapeutic approaches are becoming the new treatment modality in some cancer types. However, clinical efficacy is still limited to a marginal number of patients due to a newly developing understanding of the complex tumor microenvironment and a limited ability to appropriately select patients who have specific biomarker signatures and have the potential to optimally respond to specific immunotherapy or combination strategies. An additional challenge in assessment of biomarkers that show clinical utility to predict patient benefit includes the use of different methodologies and platforms that make it difficult to make accurate conclusions on the biomarkers in question. Thus, optimized biomarker strategies that can overcome immune barriers will allow tailoring of the therapeutic approaches and result in bold interventions that would be most beneficial to individual patients. The National Cancer Moonshot was launched in 2016 with the goal of boldly combating cancer beyond incremental advances leading to the creation of a ?Cancer Immunotherapy Translational Science Network? that would facilitate translational research and clinical advances in immunotherapy.  Our proposal to create a resource center, named Translational Cancer Immune Monitoring and Analysis Center (TCIMAC) that will be a critical resource capable of serving any of the NCI-supported clinical trial networks. The TCIMAC will be co-led by Drs. Ignacio Wistuba, renowned cancer surgical and molecular pathologist, Elizabeth Mittendorf, well-known breast cancer surgeon and immunologist, and Chantale Bernatchez, cancer immunologist. They will be supported by a team that encompasses a multidisciplinary group of world-class and highly collaborative experts on cancer and immunotherapy. The main goals of TCIMAC are to: 1) provide centralized and harmonized services for sample collection, processing and quality assurance, and 2) use analytically-validated and standardized assays and platforms to offer state-of-the-art analyses for patients enrolled on NCI- sponsored early phase immunotherapy clinical trials. In Aim 1, we will assist in standardizing bio-banking activities and share/develop standard operation procedures (SOPs) for biospecimen collection, processing, quality assessment, and storage of biospecimens collected from NCI-sponsored early phase immunotherapy clinical trials and to link the specimens to relevant clinical, pathological, immune and molecular data within the TCIMAC-CIDC Network. In Aim 2, we will provide services to conduct both routine and innovative pathological, immunological and molecular analyses using standardized and validated assays to aid the completion of NCI- sponsored trials. In Aim 3, we will provide comprehensive biostatistics and computational services for data collection and analysis for each analytical platform, and to perform analyses, interpretation and predictive modeling of high dimensional (`omic?) data in the context of clinical outcomes. We envision that the TCIMAC will be an indispensable element as we make meaningful progress in cancer immunotherapeutic approaches."
"9466563","Cognitive dysfunction in the elderly population, ranging from simple forgetfulness to a diagnosis of Alzheimer?s disease, can impact one?s quality of life and ability to function in daily activities. It is crucial that decline be detected as early as possible in order to evaluate whether the cause is treatable, and to employ appropriate treatment, if applicable. The majority of older patients rely on their primary care physician for the bulk of their healthcare needs, but there is a lack of sensitive tools available to the physician, and there is a lack of physician?s time to use the tools that are available, leading to a failure to provide therapeutic intervention at the earliest stages of loss to potentially slow the progression of disease. There is a clear need for an easy-to-use and brief assessment tool designed to target early cognitive decline, and a need to introduce the tool to providers who most frequently care for the elderly population: Primary Care Physicians (PCPs). Psychology Software Tools, Inc. (PST) has developed such a tool, the Computer Assessment of Memory and Cognitive Impairment (CAMCI), a computerized screening tool for the detection of early signs of cognitive decline, which has been shown to be more effective in the identification of patients with subtle cognitive loss than the tool most frequently used within the PCP office (i.e., MMSE). With PST?s considerable experience in computerized testing and working with older populations, and in accordance with PST?s company mission to advance the fields of research and assessment, CAMCI would provide an option for PCPs and clinicians to provide therapeutic intervention prior to a diagnosis of dementia. Recent additions to CPT codes permit insurance reimbursement for neuropsychological testing by a computer, including time for the physician's or clinical psychologist's interpretation and reporting. The introduction of this new revenue stream for PCPs and clinicians, coupled with the characteristics of being brief and self-administered make CAMCI an attractive option for improving early intervention, providing an intelligent business solution for healthcare professionals, and a useful and effective tool that allows physicians to better evaluate and serve their patients. The specific aims included in the current project are focused on activities required to successfully move CAMCI to commercialization by extending support for late stage research and product development, including regulatory strategy and intellectual property development, data collection to replicate key studies, product extension through increasing minority representation, and development of a measure of meaningful change. The ultimate goal is to streamline the commercialization of CAMCI, and to provide a useful and effective tool in the detection of cognitive dysfunction to physicians, the providers of the majority of healthcare to the elderly population, to improve efficiency and effectiveness of clinical practice."
"9313515","African-American (AA) women have a higher incidence of many cancers (e.g., colon, pancreas) and higher cancer mortality (e.g., breast, colon, pancreas) relative to other American women, and many of these differences are unexplained. The Black Women's Health Study (BWHS), the largest follow-up study of AA women, was begun in 1995 to provide relevant information on these racial disparities. 59,000 AA women ages 21-69 from 17 states enrolled by completing health questionnaires. The BWHS has successfully followed them for cancer through biennial questionnaires and linkage to 24 cancer registries in the states in which >95% of participants live. Data have been collected on numerous potential risk factors (e.g, medical, reproductive, lifestyle, psychosocial, socioeconomic, air pollution). Cancer diagnoses are validated by hospital and cancer registry pathology data. A DNA/oral microbiome biorepository contains saliva-mouthwash samples from 26,800 participants. Blood sample collection, in progress, has obtained blood samples from 9,300 participants to date (14,000+ expected) . Breast tumor tissue has been collected for 750 incident breast cancers. The study has identified 5,631 incident cancers to date, including 2,651 breast cancers. The study has published extensively on nongenetic and genetic risk factors for breast cancer and other cancers. Because participants were young at baseline (median age = 38), accrual of less common cancers was slow. Participants have now reached ages of high cancer incidence, meaning that sufficient numbers will be accrued for informative assessment. This infrastructure proposal has 3 aims: (1) continue and enhance follow-up and data collection in the BWHS, adding information (including Medicare data) on cancer treatments and outcomes (2) manage and enhance biologic sample collection by adding additional samples to the saliva/mouthwash and blood repositories, collecting tumor tissue for all solid cancers in addition to breast cancer, collecting full-field digital prediagnostic mammograms, and genotyping with a genome-wide array all incident cancer cases for which we have a DNA sample (~2,800) together with an equal number of controls with DNA; (3) share the data in consortial projects. Continuation of the BWHS is a high priority because: a) 89% of participants are still cancer-free due to the young age at baseline; b) follow-up has been successful and unbiased ; c) the BWHS can assess the effects of exposures (e.g., class 2 and class 3 obesity, premature birth, experiences of racism) that are less prevalent in other populations; d) increasingly large numbers are needed to study scientific questions and BWHS genetic, nongenetic, and biospecimen data will contribute to numerous consortia to study a range of cancers; e) the BWHS has a record of high productivity; f) further work is needed to understand numerous racial disparities in cancer incidence and survival. In sum, continuation of the BWHS will contribute appreciably to knowledge about cancer etiology and survival in an underserved population; the biolospecimen and mammogram repositories will contribute greatly to that effort, as will participation in consortial studies."
"9447786","Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most aggressive and lethal primary brain tumor in humans. GBM stem cells (GSCs) are a subpopulation of GBM tumor cells that show stem-cell-like properties and play a central role in tumor propagation, therapeutic resistance and tumor recurrence. We need effective therapeutic strategies to directly deplete GSCs and/or sensitize them to current GBM therapies. Developing these therapies relies on a more complete understanding of molecular drivers of GSC tumorigenicity and therapeutic resistance. This project focuses on targeting an oncogenic signaling pathway driven by the hyaluronan-mediated motility receptor (HMMR) and its downstream effector TAZ, an oncogenic transcription factor. Our central hypothesis is that HMMR and TAZ comprise a drug-targetable pathway that promotes GSC tumorigenicity and radioresistance. We propose to fill major knowledge gaps in the function of HMMR-TAZ signaling in GSCs and therapeutic applicability of HMMR-TAZ targeting in GBM. Our recent Cancer Research paper demonstrates that HMMR is a potential therapeutic target for depleting GSCs. HMMR is hyper-expressed in clinical GBM specimens. HMMR silencing effectively inhibits GSC self-renewal in vitro and tumorigenicity in vivo. Our following studies found that HMMR forms a positive feedback loop with TAZ in GSCs. This HMMR-TAZ loop signaling is essential for cell-intrinsic radioresistance in GSCs. More interestingly, HMMR-TAZ signaling also induces the spreading of radioresistance among GSCs through paracrine mechanisms likely mediated by secretory proteins. For clinical targeting of HMMR-TAZ signaling, we identified the FDA-approved drug Verteporfin (VP) as an inhibitor of HMMR-TAZ signaling and GSC tumorigenicity. VP crosses the blood-tumor barrier, supporting the feasibility to study systemic VP treatment in GBM models. Overall, our preliminary studies justify a rigorous study of autocrine and paracrine mechanisms underlying HMMR-TAZ-driven radioresistance in GSCs, and further determining the therapeutic synergy between HMMR-TAZ targeting and radiation in pre-clinical GBM models. It is also necessary to extensively study the therapeutic efficacy of VP in GSCs, molecular mechanisms of its drug action, and the therapeutic synergy between VP and radiation. We will study two specific aims: (1) determine if targeting HMMR-TAZ signaling inhibits GSC radioresistance, and further elucidate underlying molecular mechanisms, and (2) repurpose the FDA-approved drug Verteporfin to target HMMR-TAZ signaling in GBM. If successful, Aim 1 will provide novel mechanistic insights into how GBM-associated protein HMMR drives downstream transcriptional events to promote GSC tumorigenicity and therapeutic resistance. We will reveal a novel paracrine mechanism that mediates the spreading of radioresistance among GBM cells. Aim 2 will provide a solid foundation for repurposing VP for GBM therapy. VP repurposing is a novel strategy for targeting HMMR-driven oncogenic signaling in human cancers."
"9328682","Project Summary/Abstract Bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) is the most common congenital malformation that affects 1-2% of the general population. It is associated with development of aortopathy that manifests as an ascending thoracic aortic aneurysm (TAA) or aortic dissection. Nearly 45% of patients requiring surgery to replace the ascending aorta because of TAA or aortic dissection have BAV. Unlike other congenital diseases like Marfan, Loeys-Dietz or Ehlers-Danlos syndromes, the genetic alteration causing the aortopathy associated with BAV is unknown, despite its known inheritance. The mechanism predisposing the BAV patient to the associated aortopathy is ill- defined. It is known that TAA formation and the propensity for dissection in the setting of BAV involve degeneration of the extracellular matrix (ECM) by matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and apoptosis of aortic smooth muscle cells (SMCs). Furthermore, BAV SMCs display impaired basal oxidative stress response compared to normal SMCs. However, the interplay between the ECM and SMCs has yet to be elucidated. Therefore we propose these specific aims to determine this relationship: Specific Aim 1: Determine how ROS affects ECM production and degradation by aortic SMCs. Specific Aim 2: Identify how collagen microarchitecture affects ROS-induced SMC proliferation and death. Specific Aim 3: Determine how collagen microarchitecture influences SMC function under oxidative stress. Our study will take advantage of our extensive tissue bank of native aortic specimens from patients with TAV and BAV, with and without aneurysmal disease to create high power studies. We will use innovative techniques like macromolecular crowding to modulate the ECM and multiphoton microscopy. Ultimately, with the completion of the aims, we hope to advance the clinical care of patients with BAVs by: 1) Developing pharmaceutical or other therapeutic options for patients with BAV who are at risk for aneurysmal progression, 2) Delineate the molecular mechanisms that initiates the pathogenesis of BAV, and 3) Improving the rupture risk predictions and recommendations for surgical or medical interventions."
"9289212","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT This application responds to PA-16-188 Mechanisms, Models, Measurement, & Management in Pain Research (R01). Pain management in nursing homes is sub-optimal. Sixty-two percent of nursing home residents experience pain. Although cancer is an important reason for pain in nursing homes, arthritis and musculoskeletal problems affect over three quarters of persons over 65 years of age. Despite the high prevalence of painful conditions experienced by nursing home residents, non-malignant pain in nursing homes has not been thoroughly studied. Pain is seldom an isolated symptom and is often associated with/accompanied by other symptoms in common clusters. We do know that pain is under-reported in nursing homes and when documented, its treatment is often suboptimal. For nursing home residents, a ?geriatric pharmacoparadox? exists ? i.e., despite the growing population and the high burden of medication use, geriatric nursing home residents are systematically excluded from clinical trials. The resulting dearth of information requires rigorous non-experimental study designs to quantify the risks and benefits of medication use. This study extends the literature in two ways. First, it seeks to improve measurement of pain. Second, with improved measurement in hand, it seeks to expand knowledge on how best to relieve pain using pharmacologic approaches. This application builds on previous and ongoing work conducted by our team. We are currently working on characterizing non-malignant pain symptom clusters (cross-sectional and longitudinal) using latent variable modeling approaches. The work proposed in this application will further refine these models using a contemporaneous dataset. We will update our in-house data set to include the most recent data available (the Minimum Data Set 3.0 (MDS) and Medicare eligibility and claims data (Part A & D)). The specific aims are to: 1) Validate pain symptom clusters in current data; 2) Describe correlates of pain symptom clusters; 3) Describe analgesic use by pain symptom clusters; and 4) Quantify the extent to which medications are associated with outcomes such as improvements in pain and adverse events (e.g. falls/fractures, hospitalizations). Advanced statistical techniques including latent variable models, marginal structural models, and quantile regression will be used. Untreated, potentially undertreated and inappropriately treated non- malignant pain remains common in the nursing home setting. Non-malignant pain, and how best to relieve it, is understudied in the nursing home setting. This is a novel area of exploration that will provide needed information to form the basis of effective clinical strategies to improve non-malignant pain management in nursing homes."
"9525332","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Stroke is the leading cause of serious, chronic disability in adults worldwide. Over 750,000 new strokes occur in the United States each year accounting for over half of all acute neurological hospital admissions in both civilian and Veterans' hospitals. The most persistent stroke-related motor impairments affect the upper- extremity (UE)14. Among survivors, 73-88% present with sensorimotor impairments affecting upper-extremity function and 55-75% experience difficulty using the arm for activities of daily living activities. To date, upper- extremity rehabilitation fr post-stroke hemiparesis has produced highly variable outcomes revealing minimal genuine change in motor impairment or functional use of the affected arm. Our long-term goal is to restore UE motor function following stroke. The overall objective of this proposal is to improve our understanding of neural mechanisms contributing to inter-limb and inter-hemispheric transfer following non-paretic limb exercise to task failure. We will use transcranial magnetic stimulation to probe acute adaptations in cortical excitability, intracortical and inter-hemispheri circuits that accompany behavioral facilitation of the paretic hand. The work proposed in the current application will enable us to obtain three data elements that are critical to our current working hypothesis. We will: 1) investigate changes in intracortical and interhemispheric inhibition in both hemispheres following non-paretic limb exercise to task failure; 2) test behavioral effects on paretic limb function using a motor task involving manipulation and dexterity; 3) determine the persistence (i.e., time course) of acute neural and behavioral facilitation and its consistency over repeated sessions. Our results will inform regarding the mechanisms of inter-limb and inter-hemispheric transfer post-stroke and contribute development of a clinical intervention to be tested in future studies. The data obtained in this small study wil prevent failure of a larger, clinical investigation by enabling us to develop appropriately focused mechanistic hypotheses, understand the effects elicited and therefore project a sample size to afford appropriate statistical power in our future study. Ultimately, the work conducted in this small project and future studies will advance our knowledge regarding the neurobiology of motor recovery following stroke, providing insight regarding the phenomenon of interlimb transfer and the associated mechanisms of neural plasticity.

"9326982","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The rising prevalence of severe obesity in early childhood, especially in underrepresented minorities, is a challenge to the cardio-metabolic health of our youth. Although largely attributed to the environment, heredity plays a significant role in determining adiposity. The influence of these genetic factors is largely undefined in children from underrepresented minorities where the prevalence is the highest. This study seeks to identify the rare genetic variants contributing to severe obesity in a large cohort of children with severe early onset obesity from mixed ethnic groups. The primary goal is to explain the biology of extreme obesity by understanding the effects of genetic variants on physiological attributes leading to extreme obesity. We hypothesize that the burden of genetic variants related to obesity will be higher in children with severe early onset of obesity,  The sample of subjects is selected from children with severe obesity (BMI > 120% of the 95th percentile, equivalent to Class II obesity or higher), documented at an age less than 6 years. We have established a large multi-institutional collaborative cohort including a prospective family study of children attending the clinics at Boston Children?s Hospital that serve large populations of underrepresented minorities, a cohort at Children?s Hospital of Philadelphia using data extraction from the electronic health records and samples from the biorepository and a research cohort from the Columbia University Medical Center. For the prospective family study, children with severe obesity and their first-degree relatives are invited to participate in the study. In the collaborative cohort, we will perform whole exome sequencing in children with extremes of obesity, most rapid trajectory of growth of body mass index and those with family structure favorable for mendelian pattern of inheritance. We will perform targeted sequencing of approximately 80 genes including those causing syndromic and non-syndromic forms of obesity, and those prioritized in the whole exome study in all other samples. We will develop an integrated genetic risk score based on the common and identified rare genetic variants, and correlate it with the longitudinal BMI trajectories and cardio-metabolic consequences extracted from the electronic health records. Additionally, we will perform metabolic phenotyping including energy intake and expenditure, body composition and hormonal response to a standard meal in a subgroup from the extreme tails of the genetic risk scores to understand the differences in physiology leading to severe obesity.  Individuals of different genetic ancestries can have different patterns of genetic variation. It is possible that studying multiple ethnicities may identify new genes. Children with rare variants of large effect, or varying genetic risk scores could help describe differences in physiology uncovering therapeutic targets, or a response to treatment that could eventually influence clinical care. Finally, our study cohort of underrepresented minorities will provide a unique replication/extension cohort for other large-scale genetic studies in children with severe obesity."

"9449905","There is a growing body of evidence that spontaneous cancers in dogs represent attractive translational models. In the field of immunotherapy, dogs offer an innovative model for translational research, as they present many of the challenges faced in ?scaling up? therapeutic systems dependent on complex interactions between multiple cell types yet under more controlled settings. They also allow for long-term assessment of efficacy and toxicities. Canine clinical trials offer unique access to a rich source of spontaneously occurring, genetically and immunologically diverse cancers with the benefits of reduced time, expense, and regulatory hurdles of a human trial. The similarities between canine and human cancers are increasingly being realized. The publicly available canine genome has propelled comparative genomics studies that have shown significant homology between dogs and humans for recognized cancer-associated genes including MET, IGF1R, mTOR, and KIT. Not surprisingly, cytogenetic abnormalities that define human cancers, i.e. BCR-Abl translocations in chronic myelogenous leukemia and RB1 deletions in chronic lymphocytic leukemia have been found in comparable canine cancers. Intracranial neoplasia occurs frequently in dogs with a reported prevalence from 0.15 to 4.5% compared to 18.2 cases per 100,000 human. Astrocytoma or glioma account for 20-36% of primary brain tumors in dogs and 25% in humans. Brachycephalic breeds such as Boxers, French and English bulldogs, and Boston terriers have a significantly increased risk of developing gliomas. Primary canine brain tumors have similar histologic classification as those reported by the World Health Organization for human brain tumors. Similar to that in humans, the prognosis for dogs with brain tumors in general is poor regardless of therapeutic intervention. However, much less is known about canine glioma treatment outcomes because only a small number of studies with few dogs have been reported. There is little information about median survival time for dogs with glioma that received any type of treatment, but estimates of days to 2 or 3 months are often given to owners. The clinical similarities between dogs and humans suggest that dogs may represent an outstanding model for testing targeted therapies; both dogs and humans might benefit from these studies. Herein, we are proposing a multi-pronged immunotherapeutic approach to improve efficacy and survival times. We hypothesize that combination immunotherapy in a canine glioma model will enhance efficacy and accelerate successful translation into phase I human trials for GBM. The objective is to use pet dogs with spontaneous GBM to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of combination immunotherapy. We propose two Specific Aims: 1. Determine the safety and efficacy of immune checkpoint blockade in spontaneous canine GBM in combination with standard of care, and 2. Assess the efficacy of immune-mediated gene therapy in combination with CD200 blockade to enhance anti-glioma immunotherapy. !"

The proposed research project titled ?Environmental Determinants of Lupus among African Americans? includes new aims which build upon ongoing work. This project explores the role of gut microbiota in the development of lupus-related autoimmunity. The proposed research has the strong support of the Sea Island Gullah African American community, with whom we have an established ongoing longitudinal cohort and a community-academic partnership. Participants for the proposed research project will be recruited from the existing ongoing longitudinal SLE in Gullah Health (SLEIGH) study to take advantage of genetic and clinical data already collected since the study's inception in 2003. Dr. Kamen's investigations have been continuously NIH funded, including a 5-year K23 Career Development Award from NIAMS that led to a 4-year R21 from NIEHS and a 5-year P60 project from NIAMS under Dr. Kamen's leadership. The vast amount of accumulated past exposure data, wealth of existing stored biospecimens, and enthusiasm from study participants to take part in a study of an autoimmune disease common in their community, present a unique opportunity to address the role of the gut microbiota in the development of autoimmunity."
"9479858","OVERALL PROJECT SUMMARY ? CORNELL ME/CFS COLLABORATIVE RESEARCH CENTER Despite the fact that an estimated 1 million people or more in the U.S. suffer from Myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS), remarkably little is known about the etiology of the disease and effective therapies are lacking. ME/CFS is characterized by debilitating fatigue that is not ameliorated by rest or due to any other medical condition, and a myriad of symptoms, including musculoskeletal pain, headaches, cognitive difficulties orthostatic intolerance, and sleep disturbances. There are no simple scientifically validated tests for the illness, leading to a great deal of uncertainty among clinicians when evaluating patients who report prolonged and unexplained fatigue. Fatigue and other symptoms are exacerbated following exertion beyond a patient's particular threshold, a hallmark symptom of ME/CFS known as post-exertional malaise (PEM). The absence of biomarkers for the disease and the lack of available research models for ME/CFS amplify the deficiency of research data produced in the field to date. Recent studies implicate immune dysregulation and neuroinflammation in ME/CFS. By leveraging the experience, capabilities and varied backgrounds of researchers from four different institutions (Cornell Ithaca, Weill Cornell Medicine, Ithaca College, and Boyce Thompson Institute), as well as key personnel from many other organizations, the proposed Cornell ME/CFS Collaborative Research Center will apply neuroimaging, proteomics, metabolomics, and single cell RNA and microRNA sequencing approaches to interrogate the underlying biomedical mechanisms that contribute ME/CFS, by thorough examination of biomarkers from patients and controls both before and after symptom provocation through exercise. Three research projects will seek to (1) examine oxidative stress in the brain and neuroinflammation (Project 1), (2) examine inflammatory molecules, metabolism, and cargo of extracellular vesicle (Project 2) and (3) determine levels of gene dysregulation across the immune system (Project 3). These three research projects are supported by two cores; one Clinical Core (Core 1: Cornell CRC Clinical Core), which will recruit and screen patients/controls and oversee cardiopulmonary exercise testing and a Research Core (Core 2: Integrative Data Analysis Core), which will support CRC members with data management and bioinformatics analyses, while assimilating data across the project components to provide an integrated view of the assayed characteristics about ME/CFS subjects studied by the Center. All Center activities will be coordinated through an Administrative Core, which will foster synergy and integration within the Center, while also being the platform for collaboration with other Collaborative Research Centers and the Data Management Coordinating Center. The Administrative Core will also be responsible for outreach activities, designed to increase awareness and understanding of ME/CFS within the research community, health professionals, and the general public."
"9409134","ABSTRACT: Modulation Therapeutics is developing a first in class cyclic peptide coined MTI-101 for the treatment of multiple myeloma. The company currently has a license for the parent molecule which has been awarded a patent covering the intellectual property for both composition of matter and use in cancer in the US and Europe. Modulation Therapeutics is now poised to further advance this class of compounds by the development of a second generation derivative which is PEGylated. MTI-101 is unique with respect to chemical space and mechanism of action. Treatment of myeloma cells with MTI-101 stimulates a CD44 complex resulting in activation of the necroptotic pathway and a robust and sustained increase in intracellular calcium levels leading to cell death. Importantly, MTI-101 is i) more active in patient specimens derived from patients relapsing on therapy compared to specimens obtained from newly diagnosed patients and ii) demonstrates robust synergy when combined with the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib. The goal of the Phase I grant will be to determine the in vivo efficacy and circulating half-life of the PEGylated analog compared to the parent molecule MTI-101. We predict that PEGylation of the molecule will increase the circulating efficacious dose and increase the terminal half-life leading to increased therapeutic index of the molecule. The PEGylated analog will be tested using a syngeneic myeloma in vivo model system. The goals of the Phase II application will be to perform non-GLP and GLP toxicity in rodent (rat) and non-rodent (dog) species, design the Phase I clinical trial and completion of the IND package to the FDA. Additionally, Modulation Therapeutics will invest early into the discovery of companion diagnostics to guide precision therapy for the anticipated Phase III clinical trial. Discovery of companion diagnostics will be accomplished by ex-vivo testing of primary myeloma (CD138 positive) cells using an organotypic model system coupled to gene expression profiling. Preliminary data has identified determinants of calcium flux (Ero1L) expression and necroptosis (BIRC3, TNFAIP3) as putative predictive biomarkers of response. We anticipate early discovery work focused on primary specimens will allow for further validation in phase I-11 clinical trials leading to a potential precision medicine guided phase III clinical trial."

"9549236","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term goal of this proposal is to develop an effective treatment for developmental prosopagnosia and to understand the mechanisms of treatment-related improvements. This is relevant to the National Eye Institute's mission to better treat visual disorders and understand mechanisms of visual function. The particular goal of this proposal is to build on our previous successes at improving face processing in developmental prosopagnosics (DPs) using cognitive training targeting holistic face processing. Our specific aims for this proposal are to: 1) Determine whether an improved, longer version of the holistic face training program is more effective at improving face processing and daily functioning in developmental prosopagnosics (DPs) than active control training; 2) To use functional MRI to characterize how core and extended face processing regions change after holistic face training compared to active control training; and 3) To characterize how event-related potential (ERP) signatures of face processing change after holistic face training compared to active control training. As an exploratory aim, we also seek to determine if face-selective white matter tracts in ventral occipito-temporal regions change after holistic face training compared to active control training. To achieve these aims, we propose to run a triple-blind (assessor, participant, and data analysis is blind to treatment), randomized longitudinal treatment study with 50 DPs. We propose to have 25 DPs complete 6 weeks of holistic face training and 25 complete 6 weeks of a matched active control training that uses the same faces. After screening, DPs will perform baseline cognitive and functional assessments as well as MRI scans (including fMRI and DTI) and ERP recording. Next, DPs will be randomized to either holistic face training or active control training and will train on a laptop computer at home or in the laboratory for 30 sessions (36 mins/session) over 6 weeks. During this time, a cognitive training coach will closely monitor their progress. Within one week of intervention completion, DPs will repeat the behavioral assessments, MRI scans, and ERP recording. To measure the longevity of training effects, DPs will also repeat all assessments after a 6-week no-contact period."
"9547606","Glaucoma is a diverse group of chronic diseases that causes irreversible damage to the optic nerve and is a leading cause of blindness affecting 67 million people worldwide. It is estimated that 1 in 10 people who receive ?proper? treatment for glaucoma still experience loss of vision. The only proven method of treating glaucoma is to reduce the pressure in the eye (Intraocular Pressure; IOP). Advanced glaucoma must achieve IOP in the low teens to stop progression. Unfortunately, less-invasive therapies like anti-glaucoma drugs and laser surgery do not commonly achieve these low IOPs; therefore, surgical intervention is required. Standard glaucoma surgeries are suboptimal with unpredictable outcomes and high complication rates. Camras Vision has created a biocompatible microchannel shunt capable of regulating IOP. Our preliminary data demonstrate that the prototype can be used to set in vitro pressure based on the number and length of microchannels within the outlet tube. The key to the Camras Shunt?s success is its design to drain aqueous humor externally, thereby, avoiding failure due to scarring within the drainage site associated with all other glaucoma surgeries. In this Fast-Track application, we will create a new generation shunt, the Titratable Camras Shunt (tCS), to enable precise control of IOP. In Phase I, we will construct a tCS prototype consisting of two outlet tubes (initially sealed with sutures), each containing a single microchannel, that allows for noninvasive manipulation postoperatively. Opening and closing of individual tubes controls and adjusts the target IOP range. Additionally, the tubes can be trimmed in 0.5 mm increments to fine-tune the IOP postoperatively. In vitro fluid dynamic testing (Aim 1) will be used to assess the ability to set pressure ranges to 10-14 mmHg with one open channel and 6-10 mmHg with two open channels, and to use tube trimming to reduce resistance 3-5% with each cut of the outlet tube. The feasibility of precisely controlling IOP in vivo (Aim 2) will be assessed in cynomolgus monkeys, which exhibit similar ocular fluid dynamics as humans, over 3 months in partnership with Dr. Carol Toris (University of Nebraska Medical Center). Success and justification for progression to Phase II will be indicated by the ability to set in vivo IOPs to 10-14 mmHg and 6-10 mmHg, maintain IOP lowering in a 2-month follow-up period (IOP does not increase more than ± 2 mmHg), reduce IOP by 3-5% with tube trimming with no evidence of adverse effects to the monkeys. In Phase II, we will optimize scale-up manufacturing in partnership with Sil-Pro Medical Manufacturing Solutions. The manufactured devices will be tested after sterilization (by radiation or ethylene oxide) based on FDA guidelines for ?Aqueous Shunts - 510(k) Submissions,? which will first include flow, stability, uniformity, and mechanical testing at Camras facilities (Aim 3). Biocompatibility/toxicity testing to evaluate safety (Aim 4), which includes systemic toxicity, genotoxicity, chemical testing, and 6-month rabbit ocular biocompatibility assessments, will be conducted at NAMSA, a GLP (good laboratory practice)-approved CRO with extensive ophthalmic experience. Success will be indicated if the final form tCS meets or exceeds guidelines set forth by the FDA for Aqueous Shunts to enable Camras Vision to submit a 510(k) application. Once commercialized, we anticipate that the tCS will make glaucoma surgery as accessible as cataract surgery, which is known for its elegant surgery, effectiveness, and minimal complications. Moreover, the proposed shunt should enable ophthalmologists to target IOP with a quick and simple procedures (tube opening and trimming) that can be maintained via routine follow-up outpatient visits."
"9241897","?     DESCRIPTION:     Fragility fractures that occur during everyday activities negatively impact the health and quality of life of many individuals who have a spinal cord injury (SCI). In order to decrease the incidence of fragility fractures in individuals with SCI, there is a need for the development of better rehabilitation strategies targeted at maintaining bone health. Therapeutic exercises that load the lower limbs have shown potential to modulate bone loss after SCI, but consistently beneficial results have not been demonstrated. Bone mechanobiology research indicates that the magnitude of skeletal force and the number of loading repetitions during exercising are key parameters affecting skeletal health. Yet, the mechanical stimulus imposed on the lower limbs during different types and intensities of rehabilitation exercises have not been well characterized  or compared, making it difficult to assess their relative potential to modulate bone loss after SCI The key goals of the proposed research are to evaluate skeletal loading during four different SCI rehabilitation activities and to assess their relative potential to benefit skeletal health. Th results of this study have the potential to influence clinical practice by informing clinicians in he design of exercise protocols that will supply the lower limbs with sufficient mechanical stimulus to benefit skeletal health. The key goals will be addressed by collecting three-dimensional motion and force data while individuals with SCI perform four different rehabilitation exercises which load the lower limbs: 1) static weight bearing using a standing frame; 2) standing frame therapy with functional electrical stimulation (FES); 3) FES cycling; and 4) FES rowing. Two types of subject-specific musculoskeletal models (2D analytical models and 3D computational models) will be developed to estimate skeletal loading. Musculoskeletal models and simulations will be used to calculate the FES-activated muscle forces and the skeletal forces applied to the femur and tibia during each rehabilitation exercise. Exercises will be ranked according to the magnitude of skeletal force. The bone mechanical stimulus imposed on the lower limbs during each rehabilitation exercise will be estimated using the number of loading cycles during a typical exercise session and the average peak skeletal forces from each rehabilitation activity. The relative potential of each exercise to preserve bone density will be estimated based on the mechanical stimulus. The exercise dose that would be required for each rehabilitation exercise to produce an equivalent potential for bone health will also be calculated. These results will produce a valuable clinical resource for selecting rehabilitation exercises and activity doses which have the greatest potential to benefit skeletal health after SCI. This research study and training program will also serve to advance the applicant's career development through increased clinical exposure, advanced technical knowledge in musculoskeletal modeling, further development of clinical collaborations, and experience in the translation of research results into clinically meaningful applications. The data generated by this project will be used to design a future exercise intervention study to evaluate the effect of current and newly developed rehabilitation protocols on bone health after SCI. Additionally, the models and simulations developed for this study can be used to answer key questions about the setup and use of new or existing rehabilitation equipment or exercise techniques that could enhance the effectiveness of exercises. Results from predictive simulations that apply these models can inform physicians and therapists of modifications (e.g. cycle or rower seat position, adding weights or resistance, etc.) that could increase or decrease skeletal forces in a way that would be appropriate for each individual patient given their current skeletal status. This project represents an early step towar the ultimate goal of reducing the incidence of fragility fracture by developing better rehabilitatin protocols that can maintain bone health after SCI."
"9453969","Every year in the United States over 600,000 people experience their first stroke. Indeed, stroke is the 4th leading cause of death in the U.S. and one of the leading causes of long-term disability. There are significant sex differences in the epidemiology of stroke as well as the neurological and functional outcomes following stroke. Overall, men have a higher prevalence of stroke while women have poorer outcomes. One consequence that is reported in both men and women is the onset of post-stroke depression, although it is more common in women. Post- stroke depression is associated with significant long-term disability and often interferes with rehabilitation efforts. In spite of the pervasiveness of post-stroke depression and the negative impact of depression on long-term outcomes, few animal models have investigated the development of depressive-like behaviors post stroke. Relaxin 3 is a highly conserved neuropeptide that modulates a number of behaviors with data suggesting both anxiolytic and anti-depressant properties. Importantly, the relaxin 3 system demonstrates significant sex differences. The purpose of the current proposal is to examine the development of post-stroke depression using well-validated measures of anhedonia and effort-based responding in male and female rats (Specific Aim 1). In addition, these studies will also examine the sex-specific effects of ischemic stroke on the relaxin 3 system and will investigate the efficacy of relaxin 3 as a novel therapeutic in post-stroke depression (Specific Aim 2). Together, these studies will determine sex-specific effects of stroke-induced changes in affective behaviors with an emphasis on incentive motivation and the potential role of the neuropeptide relaxin 3 in the expression of depressive-like behaviors."
"9388693","Retinal ganglion cells and Müller glia are particularly susceptible to mechanical forces which drive inflammatory activation and RGC degeneration in diseases such as glaucoma, but the pressure transduction mechanisms are not well understood. Earlier studies have been limited to phenotyping the genetic, molecular, cellular and behavioral consequences of RGC injury and glial activation induced by elevated pressure. While many biochemical pathways were shown to be altered in hypertensive eyes, the molecular sensors that transduce mechanical forces remain obscure, confounding interpretations of time-dependence of pressure-induced remodeling changes within the retina. The dominant hypotheses about pressure injury in glaucoma focus on the role of forces on the stretch of the lamina cribrosa yet mice develop the disease but do not have the collagenous lamina. The axocentric hypotheses also cannot explain how mild pressure elevations induce early changes in dendritic architecture and synaptic function, or activate glia without visible changes in axonal transport. It is also not known how physiological levels of intraocular pressure might inform RGC physiology and whether they are sufficient to integrate with the synaptic (light) responses. Finally, although glia are often the earliest responder to mechanical stress, the mechanisms that impel mechanosensitivity to these cells and how they impact RGC physiology remain largely unknown. The proposed work addresses these confounds by identifying the mechanotransducers and elucidating their role in RGC and Müller glial calcium homeostasis and polymodal integration of pressure into the (patho)physiological retinal response. The project tests the central hypothesis that pressure sensitivity of dendrites, somata and axons of RGCs and glia is governed by mechanosensitive ion channels, which maintain tensile homeostasis and modulate calcium homeostasis, excitability and gliotransmitter release in response to changes in ocular pressure or strain. Leveraging the recently derived data and using novel mechanobiological tools, Aim 1 will identify and characterize mechanosensing ion channels in the RGC plasma membrane, quantify their activation by pressure and matrix stretch, and test the hypothesis that mechanical strains are transmitted from the plasma membrane into the cell interior through the cytoskeleton. In Aim 2 we propose to characterize the polymodal mechanism through which mechanical stimuli are integrated with the effects of temperature and synaptic (light) responses, and to test a novel hypothesis regarding the regulation of RGC tensile homeostasis. Aim 3 will characterize the molecular mechanisms whereby mechanically induced glial activation influences RGC physiology, thus providing insight into the early inflammatory mechanisms in diseases such as glaucoma. Taken together, the proposed studies may deepen our understanding of retinal function by uncovering new mechanisms that respond to acute and chronic mechanical forces and by reconciling currently disparate hypotheses about retinal pressure transduction. In addition, these studies will aid in the understanding of neurodegeneration that is required to optimize early diagnosis and neuroprotective treatment, which are currently lacking in glaucoma. During the last few years, mutations in putative mechanosensing ion channels have been shown to cause many human diseases and disorders, including severe dysplasias, gliovascular abnormalities and axonal neuropathies but their impact on visual signaling is unknown due to the absence of basic studies. The information provided by these studies may thus contribute insights into mechanosensitive mechanisms that underlie retinal disease as well as transduction of mechanical stress within the CNS."
"9357526","Project Summary / Abstract The failure of humans to respond to auditory medical alarms has resulted in numerous patient injuries and deaths and is thus a major safety concern. The widely used IEC 60601-1-8 international medical alarm standard was created to improve alarm discernibility and identi?cation. It gives designers a collection of reserved sounds for use in common alarm conditions as well as instructions for designing new alarm sounds. Unfortunately, the melodic tonal patterns of IEC 60601-1-8's alarms are particularly susceptible to simultaneous masking, a condition where concurrent sounds interact in ways that make one or more of them imperceptible due to physical limitations of human perception. This is very dangerous because humans can only respond to medical alarms they can perceive. Detecting masking experimentally can be very dif?cult because it may only occur for very speci?c combinations of multiple alarms and temporal overlaps between them. To address this, we developed a novel computational method that uses formal modeling, psychophysical modeling, and veri?cation analyses to mathematically prove whether a con?guration of medical alarms can produce masking. In this work, we will update this method to enable its use in the evaluation of the masking potential of IEC 60601-1-8 medical alarms. We will then use the method to analyze the standard and identify changes to it that will prevent masking from occurring. In doing this, we will accomplish three speci?c aims. First, we will extend the method to include features not currently supported by it. This will include accounting for sub-frequencies in IEC 60601-1-8 alarm tones and the ability to search through the standard's open parameters. Second, we will use the extended method to evaluate the reserved alarms of IEC 60601-1-8 and identify open parameters within the standard that will avoid masking. Third, we will develop a procedure that engineers can use with the method to analyze and design IEC 60601-1-8-compliant alarms that will avoid masking. This project has the potential to profoundly impact patient safety. By exposing a signi?cant problem with IEC 60601-1-8, we will have identi?ed dangerous conditions that will need to be addressed. By giving engineers the information they need to design standard-compliant devices that help ensure the perceivability of alarms, newly created or updated medical devices will be safer than those from previous generations. Ultimately, by increasing the chance that medical alarms are perceivable, the responsible human will be more likely to respond appropriately and thus protect patients from preventable death and injury."
"9462271","Project Summary/Abstract: The basal ganglia are a richly interconnected group of subcortical brain nuclei that are critical for the motivation, selection, initiation and execution of actions. Consistent with these roles, dysfunction of the basal ganglia is linked to a range of debilitating psychomotor disorders including Parkinson?s disease, Huntington?s disease, dystonia, addiction, obsessive compulsive disorder and Tourette?s syndrome. The significance of the basal ganglia for both health and disease, together with the development and refinement of experimental approaches for their interrogation, have motivated the formation of large basic, translational and clinical research communities focused on these structures. Despite the importance of basal ganglia research there was until the inaugural 2014 Basal Ganglia Gordon Research Conference (GRC) only one meeting dedicated to the basal ganglia, ?IBAGS?, a triennial international meeting that is mostly held outside the USA. Furthermore, in contrast to the more interactive, discussion-focused format of a GRC, the IBAGS meeting utilizes a conventional symposium format. In 2016 the Basal Ganglia GRC incorporated a 1.5 day Gordon Research Seminar (GRS) organized by and exclusively for pre- and post-doctoral trainees. The success of the 2014 and 2016 meetings recently led the GRC board to approve the Basal Ganglia GRC & GRS as a regular, biennial meeting. The programs for the 2018 Basal Ganglia GRC & GRS were designed by an interdisciplinary committee guided by suggestions from the field. Thus, the 2018 meeting has an almost entirely new roster of speakers and covers topics that have previously received little attention including basal ganglia development, striosomes/patches, involvement of the basal ganglia in neuropsychiatric disorders, interactions of the basal ganglia with the wider motor system and basal ganglia connectomics. The unique format of the GRC and GRS, with a focus on unpublished data, discussion, and diversity in a respectful and nurturing environment, is of immense value to the basic, translational, and clinical scientific research communities and a key catalyst for basal ganglia research worldwide. The 2018 Basal Ganglia GRC and GRS have 3 specific aims: 1) accelerate advances in basal ganglia research by showcasing groundbreaking research in a uniquely interactive and respectful environment that fosters critical thinking, challenges dogma, identifies major unanswered questions, and builds collaboration and collegiality 2) promote diversity in basal ganglia research in terms of scientific approach and subject, gender balance, career stage, and minority representation through targeted programming and attendee selection and support 3) inspire, educate and mentor early career scientists at a critical phase of their careers through exposure to diverse, cutting-edge research, career mentorship, free and open discussion with more established scientists, and opportunities for scientific presentation and communication. Successful completion of these aims will strengthen and diversify research on the basal ganglia, thus accelerating discovery and translation to the clinic, consistent with the core mission of NIH."
"9408731","It is estimated that 1 in 100,000 people will experience a central retinal artery occlusion (CRAO) accompanied by acute monocular vision loss. Even when resolved by reperfusion, 80% of patients have a visual acuity of 20/400 or worse. The body?s natural response to ocular trauma is the induction of heat shock protein 72, Hsp72, to combat the acute effects of protein denaturation and aggregation and the chronic effects of apoptosis and secondary necrosis. Unfortunately, Hsp72 induction can require several valuable hours while a patient is in jeopardy of permanent vision loss. A cell-penetrating antibody, mAb 3E10, is proposed as an intracellular transporter to deliver Hsp72 into cells. Previous work with this 3E10-Hsp72 fusion (?Fv-Hsp70?) has shown cytoprotection against apoptotic cell death in vitro and in vivo. Our long-term goal is to determine the clinical effectiveness of this targeted Hsp72 in countering cell death in the retina following a CRAO. The objective here is to show our Fv-Hsp70, administered intravitreally, blocks cell death using a cerebral artery occlusion method to generate the CRAO in mice. The central hypothesis for the proposed research is that 3E10 can deliver Hsp72 directly into energy-deficient cells to minimize protein denaturation and aggregation, as well as inhibit both ATP-dependent and independent apoptosis, thus preventing significant retinal damage, particularly to the sensitive retinal ganglion cells. The rationale for the proposed research is that the cell penetrating antibody, 3E10, binds extracellular DNA and nucleosides, targets that are quite accessible where there are damaged cells, and it penetrates still viable cells through an equilibrative nucleoside salvage pathway. 3E10 is unique in that it penetrates cells without apparent harm and has been administered to humans without evidence of toxicity. Fv-Hsp70 has already been created and shown to be an effective cytoprotectant in vivo, minimizing by 68% the infarct volume in brain tissue when administered to rats after a stroke. It has also resulted in 45% less cardiomyocyte death at the heart apex of post-reperfusion treated rabbits versus 3 different sham controls. We are requesting funding to achieve the following specific aims: 1) Characterize the Fv-Hsp70?s pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics delivered to the vitreous humor. Fv- Hsp70 will be formulated in suitable ophthalmological solutions. 2) Evaluate Fv-Hsp70 efficacy at the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) by intravitreal delivery to mice in a CRAO model. 3) Evaluate the Fv-Hsp70 efficacy at the MTD at several time points after reperfusion to determine a maximal window of administration that measurably improves retinal cell survival and can be implemented in a clinical setting such as the ER. The proposed research is innovative because it utilizes a unique antibody-mediated, energy-independent intracellular delivery system for protein therapeutics. Inducing heat shock proteins in vivo takes time, whereas the impact of our product is the rapid delivery of Hsp72 into damaged cells to prevent cell death."

In short, health care is grossly under-engineered.           The Johns Hopkins Armstrong Institute Learning Lab is uniquely positioned to apply robust systems engineering methods by leveraging our transdisciplinary team of clinicians, researchers and engineers from the Johns Hopkins University's Applied Physics Lab (APL), and Schools of Medicine, Nursing, Public Health, Engineering, and Arts and Sciences. By using these methods, we will realize our goal of partnering with patients, their loved ones and others to eliminate preventable harm, optimize patient outcomes and experience, and reduce waste in healthcare. Our comprehensive program plan incorporates design thinking and systems engineering, using a model our APL team developed for the US Navy's submarine force. This can provide healthcare with a model for systematically envisioning and iterating a broad system objective and the necessary component activities required to realize that objective. In this proposal, our Learning Lab will work on three significant and interdependent patient safety areas that integrate systems engineering and health delivery research: 1) develop high-level design requirements for an Ideal ICU, utilizing design thinking and system engineering methods; 2) leverage open application programming interfaces to engineer interoperability between EHRs and infusion pumps; and 3) develop and implement an indicator of unit-level stress in an engineered care system to predict and mitigate risk"

Overall Project Summary- The Yale Center for Clinical Investigation (YCCI) was created in 2005 to strengthen Yale's infrastructure for clinical and translational research, based on the recommendation of a Medical School strategic planning committee. Soon afterwards, when NIH launched its new program of Clinical & Translational Science Awards, YCCI applied and became the home of the Yale CTSA. Since then, one of its major priorities has been to support the education and career development of the next generation of clinical and translational investigators. As described in the present application, this initiative has met with great success, underscored by the fact that graduates of YCCI's K-Scholar program have received 47 individual NIH K Awards, 43 NIH RO1 awards, and 65 Foundation grants, published >1,800 papers, and obtained >$240 million in independent research funding. Remarkably, 98% of the program's graduates have stayed in academic medicine or pursued research careers in the biotech or pharmaceutical industries. YCCI has also made substantial progress in its push to accelerate the translation of disease-related discoveries into the clinic. As will be described, it provides Yale investigators with key assistance in areas including biostatistics and bioinformatics, study design, protocol development, regulatory approval, patient recruitment, access to inpatient and outpatient research facilities, and budgeting support, and gives them ready access to pilot grants and state-of-the-art research cores. The result has been a significant upsurge in the number and scope of clinical research projects throughout the Medical Center. In the next grant cycle, YCCI will build upon these achievements with an emphasis on team-based T1 to T4 research, including studies across the lifespan. YCCI will also pursue new partnerships with the Yale School of Engineering & Applied Science to develop an innovative technology transfer program called the Center for Biological and Innovative Technology (CBIT) and with the School of Organization & Management to offer a novel program of leadership training for clinicians and physician-scientists. In addition, YCCI will take active advantage of the recent expansion of clinical services by Yale-New Haven Hospital (YNHH), which now has 1,540 beds and more than 1 million outpatients visits per year, and the growth of the Yale Medical Group (YMG), which has a network of >1,200 practicing physicians in >100 clinical specialties. The resulting clinical volume (~4 million patient records) gives Yale researchers access to a large, diverse patient base for outcomes studies and clinical trials. Overall, YCCI will leverage Yale's outstanding scientific and clinical environment and work with other CTSA hubs to foster the growth of multidisciplinary team science, to develop innovative strategies for disease prevention, diagnostics, and therapeutics, and to implement results for the benefit of the health care system and the population as a whole.

"9449320","PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT High endothelial venules (HEV) are specialized post capillary portals for lymphocyte entry into lymphoid tissues and sites of chronic inflammation from the blood. They regulate immune cell trafficking in physiologic and pathologic settings including autoimmune diseases and cancer. HEV in lymph nodes draining sites of immune challenge proliferate extensively to support enhanced lymphocyte recruitment, but the endothelial precursors that give rise to high endothelium and the molecular pathways that control their proliferation and differentiation are unclear. Our transcriptomic and immunologic studies reveal that capillary endothelial cells (CapEC) express multiple markers classically associated with stem and progenitor cells, leading to the hypothesis that capillary phenotype EC comprise a population of stem cell-like blood endothelial progenitors that contribute to HEV expansion during the immune response. Under Aim 1 we will apply state-of-the-art single cell immunofluorescence and high dimensional mass label (CyTOF) flow cytometry to uncover the diversity of EC subsets in LN and in extra lymphoid sites of immune cell recruitment, define the kinetics and subset-specificity of their proliferative responses to immune challenge, and reveal the time course of emergence of transitional phenotypes leading to the amplification and maturation of functional HEV. Trajectory analyses will reveal developmental relationships of identified subsets including identified progenitors, and immunofluorescence histology and confocal tissue imaging will define their location within the vasculature. In Aim 2, innovative fate mapping approaches will elucidate precursor-product relationships among BEC subsets and will define clonal contributions of precursors to capillary and high endothelium. Aim 3 will apply transcriptional profiling of induced EC subsets in combination with pan-EC and novel capillary EC-specific inducible gene targeting systems to define molecular mechanisms of HEV homeostasis and pathways regulating progenitor cell activation, amplification and contribution to HEV expansion in the immune response. Comprehensive phenotypic analyses of blood endothelial cell subsets and their responses to immunization will open up new areas of investigation in vascular biology and immunology. Elucidation of the mechanisms of endothelial cell specialization and homeostasis, including mechanisms regulating endothelial cells that control lymphocyte traffic, will lead to novel targets and approaches for the control of autoimmune inflammation and for therapeutic regulation of immune cell traffic for vaccination and cancer immunity."
"9408356","Abstract: A significant number of conscious hospitalized patients are unable to independently activate standard nurse call systems, and over 50% of mechanically ventilated ICU patients need assistance to communicate with their caregivers. Based on those estimates and the annual U.S. hospital discharge rate, one can extrapolate that at least 3.9 million American patients may have required some form of assistive technology (often unavailable) to be able to summon help and communicate with their healthcare providers. It is clearly essential that solutions be found that allow intubated and physically weak patients to summon help and to effectively communicate. To address that need, Iowa Adaptive Technologies (Voxello) is developing next-generation solutions to improve patient-provider communication and to allow patients to better manage their symptoms and effectively participate in their care as well as in medical decision-making and end-of-life conversations. Patients who cannot communicate with doctors, nurses, other health professionals and caregivers are at a threefold risk of experiencing adverse medical outcomes. Reducing communication barriers has the potential to annually reduce nearly 700,000 preventable adverse events and to save nearly $7 billion in healthcare costs each year. In its successful Phase I SBIR project, the Voxello team demonstrated the feasibility of using the noddleTM which allows patients to activate the nurse call and to simultaneously control a communication app with a small intentional gesture. The noddleTM uses a patented signal-processing algorithm to detect small intentional gestures such as tongue clicks, an eye blink, or any other small motor movement. Voxello has also developed the noddle-chatTM communication app to allow patients who are unable to speak to effectively communicate with their healthcare providers, thereby reducing the risk of adverse medical outcomes and increasing patient satisfaction. Voxello used an iterative design approach that was informed by feedback from patients, nurses and family members. Preliminary clinical data indicated that patients who use the Voxello technology report greater ease in summoning nurses and being able to effectively communicate. Voxello is proposing a Phase II SBIR project focused on broad-based validation and testing designed to produce the type and volume of data required to engage Phase III commercialization partners/investors. Phase II work will increase the number of intentional gestures that the noddleTM can detect and will expand the communication templates in noddle-chatTM to support medical decision-making as well as the needs of non-English-speaking patients. Voxello will conduct clinical trials during Phase II to determine how easily the noddleTM and noddle- chatTM can be implemented across clinical settings to enable patients to summon their nurses and effectively communicate. Voxello has applied to the FDA to obtain clearance for the noddleTM as a Class II medical device, and we intend to manufacture the noddleTM at our manufacturing partner's US-based certified medical device facility and develop distribution channels to serve the hospital, long-term care and home-care markets."
"9373666","PROJECT SUMMARY The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program of the National Cancer Institute serves as a national dashboard for cancer surveillance and is an authoritative resource for cancer incidence and mortality rates. However, the registry lacks information on cancer recurrence, which is a major outcome impacting decisions and policies around management of disease at both the individual and the population levels. The goal of the proposed study is to develop a scalable approach for population-based ascertainment of cancer recurrence with a specific focus on breast cancer. The first (UG3) phase of the study will develop an innovative algorithm for detecting a first recurrence by combining medical claims with patient reported outcomes (PROs). This phase will be conducted in collaboration with the Seattle-Puget Sound SEER registry and will leverage ongoing research agreements with Puget Sound payers. Different algorithms will be developed to allow for flexibility in maximizing sensitivity or specificity. The algorithms will be validated against gold-standard recurrence information based on electronic medical records from two major local providers. Study participants will consistent of stage I-III breast cancer patients diagnosed in 2013?2016 on whom ?gold standard? information on recurrence is available. A retrospective case-control design will be employed in which an equal number of recurrent cases and non-recurrent controls at each validation site will be solicited for PROs regarding their recurrence histories. All validation activities will explicitly adjust for missing data resulting from participant non-response to the PRO solicitation. The second (UH3) phase will be conducted in collaboration with the Kentucky Cancer Registry. The algorithms developed in the UG3 phase will be deployed on all Kentucky stage I-III breast cancer diagnoses in 2015?2017 on whom claims data are available. This phase will include a validation against medical records from patients diagnosed at the University of Kentucky Markey Cancer Center over a concurrent period. In this phase, the study team will develop a visual interface for summarizing recurrence risks overall and within specified prognostic subgroups. The interface will allow users to examine representativeness of the patient cohort used to estimate recurrence risks and will also provide estimates that are adjusted for participant non-response. The proposed work will represent a pioneering effort that establish whether medical claims data combined with patient self-report constitute a promising avenue towards determining whether the critical endpoint of cancer recurrence can be added to population-based cancer registries."
"9564597","PREVENTING SKELETAL AND CARDIAC MUSCLE AGING BY RESTORING MITOCHONDRIAL FUNCTION SUMMARY Aging is accompanied by slowly progressive and irreversible structural changes and functional declines in both heart and skeletal muscle that combine to contribute to exercise intolerance and frailty in the elderly. The increased rates of nursing home placement and hospitalization make the loss of muscle function with age a growing public health crisis in terms of both quality of life and economic costs to society. Despite this, there are few treatment options to reverse either skeletal or cardiac muscle degeneration in the elderly, due in large part to the poor understanding of the mechanisms that underlie these dysfunctions. Our previous work has demonstrated that treatment with the mitochondrial targeted peptide SS-31 improves skeletal and cardiac muscle performance, mitochondrial function, and reduces redox stress. These surprising results demonstrate that mitochondrial dysfunction with age is a more dynamic process than previously thought and can be reversed by late-life treatment to improve healthspan. Recent data indicates that SS-31 does not act as a traditional antioxidant by scavenging reactive oxygen species. Instead SS-31 appears to interact with mitochondrial cardiolipin to improve mitochondrial electron transport system (ETS) function and reduce mitochondrial oxidative stress. We propose that improved ETS function with short-term treatment reduces redox and energy stress which improves function and stress response of the aged heart and skeletal muscle. With long-term treatment this improved stress signaling restores mitochondrial and tissue structure, leading to further improvements in muscle performance. This proposal will define the redox and energy dependent signaling mechanisms by which SS-31 treatment reverses cardiac and skeletal muscle energetic dysfunction at late age (Aim 1), as well as the mechanisms by which these changes subsequently rejuvenates cardiac and skeletal muscle structure to improve performance (Aim 2). The final Aim 3 will test whether reducing mitochondrial oxidative stress by treating mice beginning in middle age can preserve muscle healthspan and exercise tolerance. We believe that the combined study of both heart and skeletal muscle will provide key insights into similarities and differences in how their functional impairments respond to enhanced energetics and redox signaling and how improvements in both will combine to enhance healthspan and exercise tolerance. The end result will be new insights into the mechanistic basis of this new paradigm for improving muscle health with potential for direct translation to elderly humans."
"9484404","The primary objective of the Academic-Community Engagement and Dissemination Core (ACED) of the UAB Obesity Health Disparities Research Center (OHDRC) is to build on the existing infrastructure to facilitate academic-community engagement between investigators and stakeholders across the state of Alabama in order to reduce obesity related health disparities between African American and Whites. The ACED Core will implement initiatives and targeted communications to disseminate findings based on our proposed OHDRC approach and framework taking into account stages in the life course, as well as the levels of influence (i.e., individual, interpersonal, community and societal). Specifically, the ACED will: 1) Strengthen and expand existing partnerships and coalitions to build statewide capacity for expansion of an integrated set of initiatives for obesity reduction through healthy eating and physical activity; 2) Implement a ?train-the-trainer? model to replicate healthy eating and active living initiatives designed to serve as engaged dissemination strategies aimed at individual, community and system-level changes across the life course; 3) Conduct targeted dissemination of research-based obesity-related health disparities information using mass and targeted diffusion via communication channels and established stakeholder groups; 4) Assist OHDRC pilot and research project investigators in identifying and partnering with community organizations to inform their research and disseminate findings and 5) Continuously monitor and assess the outcomes of engagement and dissemination activities. Our approach of active community engagement in developing, implementing, and disseminating community specific obesity initiatives will help individuals and communities use research findings in practical, scalable and sustainable ways. This approach capitalizes on the processes and infrastructure we developed through the COE P60 and the Mid-South TCC U54 to improve outcomes related to healthy eating and physical activity and to strengthen the applicability of our research efforts, thereby increasing the return on these previous NIH investments while building community capacity and transferring research findings into practice."
"9415197","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Chronic disease and decreased mobility associated with obesity in older (65+ yrs) adults emphasize the urgent need to identify obesity treatments in this population that are evidenced-based, effective in the long-term, and perhaps age-specific. The latest obesity treatment guidelines for all ages recommend an intensive intervention involving behavioral counseling, caloric restriction, and increased physical activity to achieve weight loss. However weight regain after treatment cessation is very common, especially in older adults in whom the currently recommended strategy of continued performance of high-volume structured exercise of 200-300 min/wk may be less feasible and effective. A key factor contributing to weight regain is the decrease in energy expenditure that occurs in response to weight loss, due mainly to a decline in non-exercise or spontaneous physical activity (SPA) that is the direct result of an increase in sedentary behavior (SB), or time spent sitting or reclining. Our pilot data show that decreases in SPA predict magnitude of weight regain. Since older adults spend 65-80% of their waking day sitting or prone, we hypothesize that intervening on SB will be a more effective method for preventing weight regain than the conventional approach of intervening on exercise behavior in this age group. The proposed research will test the efficacy of a novel, acceptable, behavioral intervention (SitLess) that focuses on increased awareness of SB employing inclinometer-based self-monitoring throughout the day. Our pilot data show that this intervention may improve weight loss during the intensive phase of treatment and prevents weight regain during a short (5-month) follow-up phase. The primary aim of this study is to determine whether addition of this intervention that targets SB to a conventional weight loss intervention that targets exercise results in lower long-term reduction in weight in older, obese adults. This will be accomplished with a 24-month trial in 225 obese (BMI=30-40 kg/m2) older (65-79 yrs) adults randomized to one of three treatments (n=75), all with dietary caloric restriction plus either: 1) moderate-intensity aerobic exercise (WL+EX); 2) intervening on SB (WL+SitLess); or 3) (WL+EX+SitLess). The primary hypothesis is that: WL+EX+SitLess will have lower 24-month body weight than either WL+EX or WL+SitLess. Secondary outcomes, including resting and physical activity energy expenditure, SB, dietary intake and appetite, body composition/bone density, physical function, cardiometabolic risk and intervention process measures, will also be examined. The results will provide the first randomized, controlled trial data on the efficacy of self-monitoring of a key contributor to the adaptive thermogenic response to weight loss. Increasing awareness of weight loss-induced reductions in SPA, and behavioral promotion of decreasing SB to counteract these reductions, may provide for a more effective, safe, non- pharmacologic, and sustainable strategy to reduce weight regain after weight loss in older adults."
"9442932","Project Summary/Abstract Many survivors of a left-hemisphere stroke are impaired at reading, at least immediately following the stroke. Reading impairments have a profound impact on one's well being. Reading typically improves over years following the stroke, though some degree of impairment remains common. Improvements in reading during recovery are thought to depend on neural plasticity, or the damaged brain reorganizing to better support the impaired reading functions. The long-term objective of our research is to characterize this neural plasticity so that we can develop new interventions that will enhance the recovery of reading following stroke. The immediate goal is to map this neural plasticity using functional neuroimaging, comparing a group of patients with reading impairments following stroke to controls, with the following three aims. Aim 1: We will investigate the extent to which there are consistent patterns of activation during reading tasks that distinguish individuals with reading impairments following stroke from control participants. Aim 2: We will use functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) decoding methods to determine whether patients and controls differ in what different parts of the brain are doing functionally. Neural plasticity has been argued to either reflect functional take-over, whereby the function previously performed by a damaged area is shifted to a different brain region, or reflect a compensatory masquerade, i.e., the refinement of an intact cognitive process not normally used to perform a task. To determine which type of neural plasticity is occurring in the reading network, new fMRI analysis techniques are needed that go beyond activity magnitude investigations of brain regions to decode the information present in the distributed patterns of activation. We will develop such techniques and apply them to our sample to determine the extent to which individuals with chronic reading problems show consistent types of neural plasticity. Aim 3: Increases in neuronal activation to language tasks are often observed in unexpected regions with brain damaged participants. Little is known about what function these regions serve for patients during their recovery. Using the methods developed in Aim 2, we will investigate the function of these additional activated regions in our sample. The proposed research will make progress towards characterizing the nature of neural plasticity in the reading system following stroke, including an innovative approach for investigating what shifts in the neuronal activation profile of patients means in terms of changes in cognitive function. This research will provide key preliminary data to support a R01 grant application that will further elucidate how patterns of neural plasticity might differ among participants depending on lesion location or behavioral impairment, mapping these changes longitudinally across the acute through chronic phases of stroke and delineating neural plasticity in response to specific treatments. The proposed project builds on the PI's solid track record of research in cognitive theories of reading, investigations of individuals with acquired written language impairments, and use of innovative, theoretically grounded analysis tools for fMRI data."
"9353754","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Mental health diagnoses are common in pediatric practice. Abundant evidence demonstrates that many medications used to treat children with mental health conditions are prescribed in circumstances or combinations for which they are not recommended. Such use may lead to patient harms such as onset of diabetes or suicidal ideation, and potentially avoidable emergency department visits and hospitalizations. This project proposes (1) to describe in detail the epidemiology of patient safety in ambulatory care settings, focusing on medication safety in children with mental health diagnoses who are enrolled in New York State Medicaid ; (2) to assess the extent to which three strategies: a) receipt of primary care in a National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA)-recognized patient-centered medical home (PCMH); b) a new state policy (carve-in) that assigns responsibility to manage the prescription pharmaceutical insurance benefit to managed care plans rather than the state Medicaid program; and c) a more patient-centered, comprehensive set of medication reconciliation (med rec) practices can reduce potentially dangerous medication use or undesirable consequences / patient harms in this populations; and (3) to assess whether or not a state Department of Health quality department's implementation of a survey to assess medication reconciliation in practices throughout Medicaid is an effective way to enhance the performance of such practices. The epidemiological study will use cross sectional, univariate, bivariate, and multivariable analyses for each year from 2014 to 2017, including logistic regression and regression risk analysis. It will look at clinical, patient, contextual, and practice characteristics that are associated with lower and higher uses of potentially dangerous medication practices and undesirable outcomes. It will describe identified disparities, considering characteristics such as gender, race/ethnicity, rural/urban residence, foster care status, and level of poverty in the home county. A propensity score analysis will help to assess the association of the specified medication practices with undesirable outcomes and patient harm. Assessment of the PCMH and med rec strategies will utilize propensity score analyses that are modified from the models developed during the epidemiological analysis. The state carve-in policy, implemented in late 2011, will be assessed using a segmented regression analysis of an interrupted time series from 2008 to 2016.=Medication reconciliation practice will be assessed using a survey instrument developed by an AHRQ- CMS CHIPRA Center of Excellence in the federal Pediatric Quality Measures Program. The impact of measurement on med rec practices will be assessed using a cluster randomized trial with a stepped wedge design, surveying one third of practices in all years, on third in years two and three and one thir in year three only. This project promises to provide more detailed insight both into an important patient safety risk in ambulatory settings for a vulnerable population and also into how well several strategies reduce risk in real world settings."

"9433511","Project Summary  The United States has a large and rapidly growing Latino population. At the same time, Latinos and transgender persons in the US carry disproportionate HIV burden. Currently, no efficacious HIV prevention interventions exist for transgender persons who have sex with men. In response to RFA-PS-16-003 ?Evaluating Locally-Developed or Adapted (Homegrown) Combination HIV Prevention Interventions for Transgender Persons who have Sex with Men?, our community-university partnership proposes a 4-year study (U01) to refine, fully implement, and rigorously evaluate a small-group combination intervention designed to promote behavioral, biomedical, and social/structural approaches to HIV prevention by increasing condom use, HIV testing, PrEP use, and use of safe transition-related healthcare services among Latina transgender women who have sex with men. The intervention, known as Chicas Creando Acceso a la Salud (ChiCAS; Girls Creating Access to Health), was developed locally by a community-based organization, in partnership with Latina transgender women, and is informed by social cognitive theory and theory of empowerment education. Although data suggest that ChiCAS is promising, it has not yet been evaluated.  The proposed study is a result of a well-established community-university partnership. A total of 100 Latina transgender women who have sex with men will be enrolled. Participants will complete an initial baseline assessment designed to measure current sexual health behaviors, healthcare use, and psychological, social, and cultural influences on sexual behaviors and healthcare use. Participants then will be randomized to the 4- session small-group combination HIV prevention intervention group or a delayed-intervention comparison group (waitlist). All participants also will complete identical assessments at 3-month and 6-month follow-up. Participants in the HIV prevention intervention, relative to their peers in the delayed-intervention comparison group, are anticipated to demonstrate (a) increased self-reported use of condoms during sexual intercourse; (b) increased HIV testing; (c) increased use of PrEP; and (d) increased use of safe transition-related healthcare services (including medical care and mental health services). The results and products from this study will be disseminated to inform public health practice, research, and policy. Results and products will include: (1) a Spanish-language combination small-group HIV prevention intervention that is: culturally congruent, designed to reduce risk among Latina transgender women, and ready for dissemination and further implementation if found to be efficacious; and (2) a deeper understanding of HIV risk, use of transition-related healthcare services, and intervention among Latina transgender women."
"9432344","Project Summary Endometriosis is one of the few disorders in women's health research with little progress made in the last 20 years relative to screening, detection, prognosis, and treatment. Reactive aldehydes, formed during oxidative stress, are produced and elevated in women with endometriosis and are metabolized intracellularly by aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (ALDH2). The central hypothesis of this K99/R00 proposal is that the balance of reactive aldehyde production and metabolism underlies endometriosis and endometriosis-associated pain. The research goal of this project is to determine the role of reactive aldehyde production and aldehyde metabolism in endometriosis to identify a novel treatment and biomarker for women suffering from endometriosis. This proposal includes a comprehensive research training and career development plan under the guidance of expert mentors, advisors, and contributors (Drs. Eric Gross, Daria Mochly-Rosen, Marcia Stefanick, Julie Christianson, and Linda Giudice). The Mentored Phase will be conducted at Stanford University School of Medicine, a world-class environment for training in cutting edge research and career development. During the K99 mentored training phase (Years 1-2): Aim 1 will determine if reactive aldehyde metabolism influences the development of endometriosis using ALDH2*2 knock-in mice with reduced aldehyde metabolism, an experimental model of endometriosis, and cutting-edge techniques to measure reactive aldehyde production and aldehyde metabolism. Aim 2 will determine if reactive aldehyde metabolism is altered in women with endometriosis using techniques from Aim 1 to analyze human endometrial tissue samples from women with and without endometriosis provided by the UCSF endometrial tissue bank. This phase will consist of training in biochemical techniques to measure reactive aldehyde production and metabolism, formal course work, mentoring, grant writing, and seminars to prepare Dr. Stacy McAllister for a career as an independent investigator in the women's health field with a particular focus on endometriosis. During the R00 independent research phase (Years 3-5): Aim 3 will determine if reactive aldehyde metabolism influences endometriosis-associated primary abdominal and secondary vaginal pain (hyperalgesia) using the skills mastered in the training phase, an endometriosis experimental model, unique equipment and specialized skills to assess hyperalgesia, and a novel ALDH2 activator (to increase reactive aldehyde metabolism). Overall, this research proposal addresses an important issue outlined by the NICHD mission statement that women suffer no harmful effects from the reproductive process. Further, this proposal will train a future leader in the endometriosis field to tackle the major health problem facing 1 in 10 women of childbearing age."
"9380894","ABSTRACT Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most commonly-diagnosed cardiac arrhythmia, affecting more than 33 million individuals throughout the world. One in four Americans above the age of 40 will be diagnosed with AF in his or her lifetime. AF accounts for one-fourth of all strokes and is also associated with an increased risk of dementia, heart failure, and death, even in patients receiving optimal evidence-based care. Despite the profound healthcare burden caused by AF, there is a limited understanding of the mechanisms that provoke the arrhythmia in patients. Hence, new pathophysiologic insights into AF susceptibility are essential to guide improved therapeutic and preventive strategies to reduce the unacceptable burden of stroke, death, and hospitalizations associated with AF. TBX5 has been associated with AF both through GWAS and familial inheritance. However, the role of TBX5 specifically in the adult atrium has not been investigated. We now generate compelling preliminary data using conditional deletion of Tbx5 in the adult mouse using a tamoxifen-inducible Cre recombinase. This strategy of conditional deletion in adult mice bypasses the developmental requirements of TBX5 and permits study of TBX5 in normally developed adult hearts. We found that deletion of Tbx5 in the mature myocardium leads to reproducible, spontaneous atrial fibrillation in the absence of heart disease or any structural abnormalities. Preliminary gene expression analysis in the atria after removal of Tbx5 reveals misregulation of many genes linked to AF, including a number of ion channels and the transcription factor Pitx2, the most frequently implicated AF susceptibility locus. We hypothesize that TBX5 drives a gene network in the adult atria which includes PITX2 and coordinates the maintenance of atrial rhythm in the adult heart. This proposal will define the mechanisms by which adult removal of Tbx5 results in atrial fibrillation, and delineate the pathways by which TBX5 and maintains normal atrial rhythm. Defining these atrial transcriptional networks will allow prediction of AF risk and a strategy for primary prevention.   "
"9347273","Project Summary/Abstract The goal of the project is to prevent young drivers from using their mobile phones (e.g., texting) while driving. An improved technological intervention and a new distribution model for that intervention are proposed. In 2009, more than 5,400 people died in crashes that were reported to involve a distracted driver and about 448,000 people were injured. Among those killed or injured in these crashes, nearly 1,000 deaths and 24,000 injuries included cellphone use as the major distraction. The CDC reports in a 2012 national survey that 52% of U.S. drivers ages 18-29 reported texting or e-mailing while driving at least once in the last 30 days, and more than a quarter report texting or e-mailing ?regularly? or ?fairly often? while driving. The proportion of drivers reportedly distracted at the time of a fatal crash has increased from 7 percent in 2005 to 11 percent in 2009. Many states are enacting laws to curb texting and cellphone use while driving; however the continued prevalence of this activity even where it is illegal illustrates the need for a technological solution. Technological solutions, in the form of hardware or software that block texting (interlocks) exist, but are not widely utilized. Hardware technologies require vehicle modifications, which limits their appeal. Almost all software technologies rely on GPS to provide vehicle velocity information as an interlock criterion. Texting is disabled when the phone is moving at more than 10 MPH for example. Unfortunately, this sensing modality cannot distinguish whether or not the smartphone is being used by a driver or passenger and therefore disables texting for all passengers in any vehicle under travel including public buses, school buses, trains, passengers in a car, etc. We propose a novel software solution that distinguishes drivers from non-drivers and a new technology distribution strategy that will more effectively engage parents."
"9336232","Project Summary Preventing and reducing the risk for youth violence remains a significant challenge for communities across the country. Researchers have consistently called for a coordinated, comprehensive public health response to youth violence, but our nation lacks the prevention infrastructure to put this approach into place ? particularly in high-burden urban communities. This project is designed to provide a replicable roadmap for building this infrastructure at the community-level. The Denver Youth Violence Prevention Center (DYVPC) builds from the efforts of our current YVPC, Montbello?s Steps to Success project, which focuses on evaluating a data-driven multi-faceted approach to youth violence prevention. We bring together a multidisciplinary team of researchers, practitioners, and community partners to implement and evaluate a prevention system that delivers community- and policy-level youth violence prevention strategies matched to local need in two high-burden Denver communities. DYVPC activities include: (1) working in collaboration with community partners in two high- burden Denver communities with different levels of readiness to implement Communities That Care (CTC) ? an evidence-based, community-level prevention system that provides a data-driven framework for community decision-making. For this project, CTC will focus on the selection and implementation of community-level prevention strategies and policies that best address community needs, values, and resources; (2) enacting a policy change in violence screening through routine health care settings to identify high-risk youth and match them to evidence-based interventions; (3) conducting an implementation process evaluation to measure community readiness and capacity to build a local prevention infrastructure and monitor implementation fidelity of the community-level prevention system; (4) using multiple quasi-experimental designs to evaluate changes in (a) neighborhood social processes and characteristics that may be influenced by the community-level prevention system and selected community- and policy-level prevention strategies and (b) rates of youth violence; (5) developing an implementation roadmap for future replication and scalability both locally and nationally. The sites participating in this study are two high-burden Denver residential neighborhoods, Montbello and Northeast Park Hill, with rates of violent activity and violent behaviors that are significantly greater than the national average. This study will enhance the body of research that focuses on effective community- and policy-level prevention strategies, contribute to understanding the relationship between community readiness/capacity and prevention strategy implementation outcomes, and examine how effective community-level strategies impact neighborhood social processes and conditions. Additionally, this project has the potential to advance understanding of community-level violence prevention efforts through cross-Center collaboration with the Chicago Center for Youth Violence Prevention. The comparability with Chicago will permit examination of the generalizability of the overall project findings to other communities."
"9442586","As synchronous population events SPW-Rs are strongly implicated in the transmission of intra- hippocampally stored representations to extra-hippocampal targets, supporting the consolidation of memory at these targets. The primary hippocampal output originates from CA1 pyramidal cells (CA1PCs), and CA1PCs with specific cortical and subcortical extra-hippocampal targets are thought to be differentially distributed along the main hippocampal anatomical axes. In turn, recent studies demonstrated the presence of a large degree of morphological and functional heterogeneity within the CA1PC populations along these same hippocampal axes, suggesting the presence of target-specific functional subdivisions within the hippocampal network. However, the precise anatomical and functional organization, recruitment mechanisms and behavioral relevance of SPW-Rs along these extra-hippocampal target-specific subdivisions remain unknown. In Project 4, we will perform an extensive set of new correlational and pertubational experiments which will provide novel insights into CA1PC target-specific SPW-R organization and function."
"9424462","PROJECT SUMMARY The overarching goal of this study is to determine how different trajectories of minority stress experienced throughout adolescence may predict behavioral health outcomes for SMA. Relying on methods established and tested in our preliminary work, we will recruit a national sample of diverse SMA (e.g., race and ethnicity, gender, urban vs. rural; N = 1,500) through both social media and respondent-driven sampling strategies in the first year of the project. We will follow participants for three years, incorporating the fundamental tenets of developmental psychopathology, which suggest that examining risk and protective factors for adolescents necessitates longitudinal exploration across critical stages of development. Guiding the proposal are three specific aims: Aim 1: Describe the individual and group trajectories of minority stress over time by following a national sample of SMA (N = 1,500) for 3 years. WH1: There will be differences in minority stress across adolescent development. Aim 2: Determine whether trajectories of minority stress are associated with differences in behavioral health outcomes over time. WH2.1: Trajectories of minority stress and behavioral health outcomes will be associated over time. WH2.2: Reporting higher levels of minority stress in early adolescence will be associated with poorer behavioral health outcomes in later adolescence. Aim 3: Determine whether the association between minority stress and behavioral health over time is different based on sociodemographic characteristics (e.g., urbanicity, gender, race and ethnicity). WH3: There will be significant differences in outcome trajectories by demographic subgroup. WH4: Trajectories of minority stress will be inversely associated with protective factors over time and will differ by demographic subgroup. To test our hypotheses, we propose cutting-edge longitudinal quantitative methodology including latent growth-curve modeling, which are rarely used to examine longitudinal risk among SMAs. The proposed research will be the first to determine how minority stress may influence health across adolescence, and this information can be used directly to inform clinical assessment and the development of targeted behavioral health interventions for this high-need population."

Since the last CCSG renewal, basic science has been strengthened substantially with recruitment of world class leaders in immunology, genomics, proteomics, drug discovery and cancer biology. Translational research has been enhanced and strategic planning implemented to accelerate reductions in cancer deaths in this decade, through MD Anderson's 'moon shot' efforts across the cancer care continuum focused on several major cancers. These planning efforts were made possible by the CCSG disease programs and their well-established multi-disciplinary interactions. Since the last renewal 21 new agents developed at MD Anderson have entered clinical trials, 8 additional agents are expected to enter clinical trials in the next year and 12 INDs were prepared by the cancer center. Clinical research has been strengthened with new leadership, further development of infrastructure and data bases, and emphasis on hypothesis driven, investigator initiated trials. Cancer is a global problem, and MD Anderson has built a network of 26 Sister Institutions in 19 countries to facilitate research and educational activities. Cancer prevention and survivorship is a priority for MD Anderson with an emphasis on molecular epidemiology, behavioral science, clinical cancer prevention and early detection research to reduce the burden of cancer within Texas and worldwide."
"9290114","ABSTRACT The long-term goal of the proposed research is to reveal how electrically non-excitable glial cells modulate synaptic transmission in response to neuronal inputs using fly visual system as a model. Previous studies on vision mostly have been focused on the visual transduction cascades and the neuronal circuits, whereas our knowledge about the role of glial cells in vision is very limited. Neurobiological research in the last decade has found that, In addition to their supportive role in neuron survival and function, the central neuropil glia astrocytes can respond to various neurotransmitters, and likely modulate neuronal synaptic transmissions. Neurotransmitter receptors are also detected in visual glia including Müller cells. However, it remains to be elucidated how glia modulate synaptic transmission in visual system, and how this glial function is controlled conversely by neurons. To study this function of perisynaptic glia, we plan to use the Drosophila visual system as a novel model, which allows genetic manipulation of signaling molecules specifically in glia or neuron, as well as subsequent observation of neuronal activities via reporters in live animals with intact glial networks. In the first visual neuropil region (lamina) of fly, photoreceptor axons release histamine upon light stimulation to hyperpolarize projective large monopolar cells (LMC). All neuronal processes are wrapped laterally by three epithelial glia cells (EG) in each laminar cartridge. We have previous found that EG concentrate a glutamate-gated chloride channel GluCl in special membrane processes abutting terminals of T1 interneuron. Our preliminary study showed that loss of GluCl diminished the Ca2+ response of LMC to light change, and impaired fly locomotion vision in dim conditions. Both dark-vision and electroretinogram defects of the GluCl mutant were phenocopied by downregulation of a glutamate transporter EAAT1 in T1, suggesting the involvement of T1 neuron and EAAT1 in the stimulation of GluCl. Finally, a cation channel NA in T1 appeared to function upstream of GluCl as well. Based on these observations, we propose to test a voltage-dependent, non-vesicular mechanism of neuron-glia communication, in which T1 neuron releases glutamate through EAAT1 to open a GluCl-gated Cl- pool in EG, thereby facilitating the inhibition of LMC by photoreceptors. This model may represent a general mechanism for interneuron to modulate synaptic weight through glia in both flies and mammals, and may occur in central brain as well. Using a combination of molecular and cell biological, genetic, histological, electrophysiological and in vivo imaging approaches, we will specifically demonstrate that 1) a GluCl-gated glial Cl- pool is essential for the inhibitory visual transmission; 2) T1 neuron releases glutamate through EAAT1 to open glial GluCl channel; and 3) depolarization of T1 is required for EAAT1 to release glutamate."

"9352383","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The formation of the mammalian neocortex is a complicated process requiring the coordination of neurogenesis and the migration postmitotic neuronal precursors. The radial glia stem cells undergoing neurogenesis oscillate their nuclei in synchrony with cell cycle progression in a process known as interkinetic nuclear migration (INM). After this, progeny migrate along the basal processes of the radial glia to their final location in the cerebral cortex. The major microtubule minus-end directed motor protein dynein has been shown to be crucial for both of these processes INM and postmitotic migration, particularly for movement of the nucleus.  Dynein depends on a variety of adaptor proteins to enhance its functionality, and recent work from our lab has shown the investigated the unique and overlapping roles of the paralog proteins NudE and NudEL (arising from the NDE1 and NDEL1 genes respectively). Both proteins are known to undergo a variety of posttranslational modifications, and phosphorylations of the proteins are known to greatly impact their function. Importantly our lab has shown that Cdk1 phosphorylation of proteins in radial glia control apical INM, and NudE is a known substrate of Cdk1. Additionally, mutations in the human NDE1 gene have been linked to severe forms of microcephaly as well as multiple cases of schizophrenia. It is fascinating that these two diseases, which are on opposing ends of the clinical spectrum in many aspects, can arise from mutations in different regions of the same protein.  The goals of this project are to: determine the effects of phosphorylation site mutations and microcephaly-causing NDE1 mutations on radial glia function in the developing rat neocortex (Aim 1), and investigate the role of NudE and NudEL during the postmitotic precursors and the effect of the schizophrenia-causing mutations of NDE1 on postmitotic neuronal migration. Using in utero electroporation of NudE with a variety of site-directed mutations to impair phosphorylation or mimic the human mutations, further insight can be gained into the pathophysiology of microcephaly and schizophrenia during neocortical development."
"9351178","Project Abstract Monitoring and evaluation of control programs for Schistosoma mansoni is currently performed by detection of parasite eggs in stool samples using the Kato-Katz technique. This method has known limitations in sensitivity and requires trained microscopists and functional microscopes to perform the assessments. Recently (in 2008), a point of care (POC) test that detects S. mansoni circulating cathodic antigen (CCA) in urine has become commercially available. It is cheaper, easy to deploy, has greater sensitivity than stool exam and rapidly becomes negative upon successful treatment. At the WHO meeting on schistosome diagnostics in February 2015, the working group and subsequently the Strategic and Technical Advisory Group (STAG) encouraged additional validation of the POC-CCA to better define what cutoffs should be used for program decision making as well as for monitoring and evaluation for S. mansoni control programs. More data are needed on the performance of newly developed schistosomal antigen tests in endemic and post-MDA settings in order to be able to develop recommendations for programmatic use of these tools. Existing evidence suggests that in areas of high prevalence (? 50%), the Kato-Katz and POC-CCA assays both provide reasonable and comparable levels of prevalence and that the current guidelines are entirely adequate for morbidity control. However, there is a paucity of comparable data in areas of low (< 30%) prevalence. Thus, we propose in this study to evaluate the diagnostic performance of the POC CCA and Kato-Katz assays in areas of low S. mansoni prevalence in western Kenya. Findings from this study will help to clarify the relationship between Kato-Katz and POC-CCA and determine whether the visual POC- CCA band intensities can be used to evaluate treatment efficacy in order to inform program interventions."
"9421062","Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), by offering the sole means of imaging human brain structure and activity with high spatial resolution, has evolved into an indispensable tool for studying brain function in health and disease. It is uniquely suited to examining the neural basis of higher order behaviors and cognition, as well as neurodegenerative and developmental disorders, for which animal models are of limited applicability. Yet, because of current experimental limitations, there is wide range of subjects and human behaviors that are completely inaccessible by MRI techniques. MRI currently depends on large, expensive, and fixed scanners in which subjects must remain motionless for long periods of time within a confined horizontal space. Thus any behavior involving motion, and especially those involving the upright real-time interaction with objects in natural environments, cannot be studied. Such studies are of enormous scientific interest, for example, in understanding the neuronal basis of motor planning, but also of considerable practical and clinical importance in order to eventually understand and address the motor deficits associated with injury, stroke, or disease which preclude everyday behaviors as important as feeding and reaching. Of particular relevance in this regard is the large population of people with limited ambulatory or vestibular function or difficulty in maintaining posture or smooth movements for which the requirements of remaining motionless in a horizontal space preclude MRI. There is thus an urgent need for a brain imaging technology that is more portable and less restricting than current MRI scanners. One way to address these issues is to decrease the size of the MRI magnet to make a head-only system which does not confine the body, but this approach leads to drastically reduced static field (B0) homogeneity which, with current technologies, precludes high resolution imaging. Now, with the support from BRAIN Initiative grant R24 MH105998, we have addressed the problem by developing new hardware, as well as new acquisition and reconstruction methods, capable of producing high quality brain images despite extreme B0 inhomogeneity. The goal of this U01 project is to build upon these efforts by designing, building, and validating the first-ever human MRI scanner requiring only the head to be inside the magnet bore and having a large window for viewing outside the magnet bore. The small size, weight, and power requirements of this 1.5 Tesla MRI system will enable it to be transported and sited almost anywhere in the world and will be able to bring the magnet to the subject rather than the other way around. To achieve this, a team of leading experts from multiple disciplines and institutions has been assembled. The hardware and software components of this revolutionary MRI system will be constructed and debugged in the first 2 years of the project, the system will be assembled and tested in years 3- 4, and finally in year 5, the MRI system will be piloted in a first of its kind study of motor coordination and planning during natural reaching behaviors. "
"9566957","Sudden death in the young (SDY) has a devastating impact on families, care providers, and the community, and attracts significant public and media attention.  The most common diagnoses that increase risk for SDY include hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, coronary artery anomalies of wrong sinus origin, arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy, ion channelopathies, and genetic forms of epilepsy such as Dravet Syndrome.  In up to 30% of cases of SDY, no specific diagnosis is found (autopsy negative).  Sudden cardiac death (SCD) has been documented at all ages and may be associated with competitive athletics.  Approximately 10-15% of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) cases may be due to ion channelopathies.  Similarly, sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) has been documented at all ages, and several risk factors have been identified, including some cases originating with ion channelopathies.  Noncompliance of antiepileptic medication usage and polytherapy in patients with refractory epilepsy are also risk factors for SUDEP. The Sudden Death in the Young (SDY) Initiative is a two-phase program to explore and provide greater understanding of SDY.  The second phase of the program will support scientific research through the use of the registry data and DNA samples using the NIH grant mechanism.  The second phase of the program will run concurrently with the SDY Registry."

"9287005","Project Summary Poly-ADP-ribosylation (PARylation) is a protein posttranslational modification (PTM) that was first documented in 1963. PARylation is catalyzed by a family of enzymes called Poly-ADP-ribose polymerases (PARPs). In particular, PARP1 is a nuclear protein that is activated as a result of sensing DNA strand breaks. The PARylation level in a quiescent cell is usually very low. In response to genotoxic stress, PARP1 is recruited to nicked DNA and is rapidly activated, resulting in the synthesis of a large number of PARylated proteins and initiation of the DNA damage repair mechanisms. The critical roles of PARP1 in mediating DNA repair and also cell death provide the rationale for developing PARP1 inhibitors to treat a number of human diseases, including cancer and ischemic stroke. In particular, cancer cells with defects in double-strand break (DSB) repair, such as BRCA1/2-mutated cells, are reliant on PARP1 activity for genome integrity. These cells undergo unsustainable genetic damage upon PARP1 inhibition. Indeed, late-stage clinical studies revealed that PARP1 inhibitor treatment significantly prolonged progression-free survival of BRCA-deficient ovarian cancer patients. This led to its recent approval by the FDA. Contrary to the fruitful efforts of characterizing the upstream regulators of PARP1, its genuine downstream targets are poorly defined, which has significantly hampered its further functional study. In particular, site-localization of protein PARylation remains a daunting challenge, due to its labile and heterogeneous nature. To address these pressing questions, we developed a large-scale mass spectrometric approach towards comprehensive characterization of the Asp- and Glu-PARylated proteome. We identified a total of 1,048 unique, endogenously modified D/E-PARylation sites on 340 proteins. These proteins are involved in not only DNA damage repair, but also a surprisingly wide array of other nuclear functions. Using a quantitative mass spectrometry experiment, we also identified many previously unknown PARP1 downstream targets, whose PARylation is sensitive to clinically relevant PARP1 inhibitors. In this proposal, we will leverage these preliminary results to continue to characterize protein ADP-ribosylation, with a long term goal of comprehensively understanding the role of PARPs and ADP-ribosylation in various pathophysiological processes. The specific aims of our proposed work are to: (1) develop a large-scale approach to site-specific characterization of the D/E-mono-ADP-ribosylated proteome; (2) develop a large- scale method to measure absolute protein PARylation stoichiometries; and (3) develop a chemoproteomic approach to systemically investigating the specificity of clinically relevant PARP1 inhibitors. We will accomplish our goals with a multi-disciplinary approach, utilizing tools including proteomics, chemical biology, biochemistry, bioinformatics and molecular biology. Knowledge we garner in this proposal will also have a profound impact on how to further explore PARPs as potential therapeutic targets for treating human diseases."
"9358711","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This study addresses research priority areas of patient-centered outcomes and health care efficiency in the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ). Operating room (OR) scheduling is critical for OR management in any hospital setting, and this project utilizes information systems and industrial engineering technologies to address a critical health service need. The perioperative (peri-op) process encompasses three stages: 1) preoperative (pre-op); 2) intraoperative (intra-op); and 3) postoperative (post-op). Solutions to improving OR performance in the intra-op stage can only have negative impact on other stages and impair the performance of the whole perioperative (peri-op) process. OR management is complicated, involving two flows (information and patient) and three phases (OR planning, scheduling, and adaptive control). Because of this complexity in OR management, the standard practice is to use simple rules in scheduling and key performance indicators to evaluate performance. Our recent studies in production scheduling theory identified inconsistencies between every two adjacent stages in the peri-op process, which explains why the currently applied simple rules and key performance indicators (KPIs) are not suitable for OR scheduling. Solutions to OR management should be efficient at the unit level and effective at the hospital level. To achieve efficiency and effectiveness in OR scheduling, we will establish a scheme to evaluate the performance of OR scheduling across the peri-op process from the perspectives of time and quality. Specific Aim 1 (effectiveness of OR scheduling at the hospital level) smoothes the information flow between units across the peri-op process and reconciles conflicting incentives of local management of different units by identifying the relationship among units from the quality perspective. Specific Aim 2 (efficiency at the unit level) smoothes the patient flow from the time perspective by simulation and revising our former heuristics for flow shop scheduling. This simulation model will enable University of Kentucky (UK) HealthCare to carry out OR scheduling for elective surgeries, emergencies and coordination among its three hospitals. Moreover, the application of multi- objective optimization to the findings while extending statistic process control (SPC) technologies in manufacturing and industrial engineering to healthcare systems."
"9437210","Peripheral neuropathy is one of the most common neurodegenerative diseases in America, with an overall prevalence of 1.66%, and 6.6% in persons older than 60 years. In spite of its prevalence, a cause cannot be identified in a substantial fraction of patients, and unless a treatable cause is identified, treatment is limited to symptoms. These sobering statistics have hung over the field for decades. However, if one accepts the idea that the genetic causes of neuropathy (which are being found at an astounding rate) will likely be informative, then exploiting this rich source of information should provide the keys to unlocking the causes and thus finding new treatments of neuropathies, not only the specific genetic causes, but also the pathways involved in the more common cause, such as diabetic neuropathy. In this view, each new cause of CMT helps to complete the ?puzzle? of how molecular defects cause neuropathy, with many unanticipated surprises. We recently described a new genetic cause of dominantly inherited demyelinating neuropathy in humans ? de novo, dominant mutations in PMP2. PMP2 encodes the myelin protein P2, which is a cytosolic protein that binds to fatty acids and cholesterol. It is minor component of compact myelin; more abundant in the PNS myelin than in CNS myelin. The disease-associated mutations described to date - p.Ile43Asn, p.Thr51Pro, and p.Ile52Thr ? are found in a similar region of the protein, giving rise to the idea that the mutants share a common toxic gain of function in myelinating Schwann cells that results in demyelination. We have made one mutation in mice, p.Ile52Thr, using CRISPR-Cas9, and propose to analyze this mouse model in the following specific aims. Aim 1: Do p.Ile52Thr mutant mice develop a demyelinating neuropathy? We generated four, independent lines of mice harboring the p.Ile52Thr mutation, and have germ line transmission in three of these lines. We will perform pathological and electrophysiological analysis on each of the three lines, comparing homozygous (p.Ile52Thr/p.Ile52Thr), heterozygous (p.Ile52Thr/+), and wild type (WT) (+/+) mice. Although heterozygous mice more accurately model the human disease, we included homozygous mice because they might have a more pronounced phenotype. Aim 2. Are PNS myelin sheaths altered in p.Ile52Thr mutant mice? Because P2 binds to fatty acids and cholesterol, we will investigate the possibility that the p.Ile43Asn mutation alters the lipid composition of myelin, by analyzing nerves by lipidomics and by performing electron microscopy of compact myelin."
"9374645","SUMMARY Nicotine addiction remains a major problem and is the leading cause of preventable mortality worldwide. Nicotine's reinforcing and rewarding effects are thought to be due to its binding to neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChR) in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) of the midbrain and ?4?2 nAChR subtype has been identified as a key receptor for the modulation of nicotine addiction. Hence selective modulation of ?4?2 nAChRs is an effective strategy for finding treatment for nicotine abuse. Varenicline, a clinically used smoking cessation agent, is a partial agonist at ?4?2 nAChRs. Dihydro-?-erythroidine (DHBE), a key constituent of the erythrina alkaloids isolated from trees and shrubs belonging to the genus Erythrina, is a potent ?4?2 nAChR antagonist with selectivity towards the ?2 subunit. Although DHBE is an excellent research standard and probe for nAChR behavioral and basic research, there has been no systematic medicinal chemistry effort done on DHBE to understand its structure activity relationships for selective modulation of ?4?2 nAChRs. Part of the reason behind this is the unavailability of a suitable synthetic route to the erythroidine core of DHBE. Moreover, it is no longer commercially available in significant amounts. Therefore, the goal of this proposal is to develop a viable enantiomeric synthesis of DHBE to obtain it in sufficient quantities for research and enable a medicinal chemistry campaign to understand its structure activity relationships. 1"
"9375655","Project Description Many trials have focused on prevention of excessive gestational weight gain (GWG), but mixed results suggest an innovative strategy may be needed. Development of an easy to use, engaging digital media intervention may increase compliance and overcome participation barriers. The Fit4Mom project will pilot test the feasibility and acceptability of mobile and social media to reduce GWG among African American postpartum women who present for OB/GYN care at Medstar Washington Hospital Center (MWHC). Internet-based interventions have shown clinically-meaningful effects on weight loss. However, there are many high risk populations for which these approaches have yet to be translated and customized. These include postpartum women and populations facing health disparities. We hypothesize that a culturally tailored digital media intervention may overcome barriers to healthy eating and active living (HEAL) and will be effective with the at risk population of postpartum African American women. The proposed Fit4Mom intervention is significant for 3 primary reasons. Previous studies have identified intervention content and used digital technologies to promote weight management and increase physical activity, but there is limited work in applying these components to postpartum women with a high risk profile, including AA women. Second, the new Fit4Mom intervention will use digital technologies so that it is easy to access from a mobile phone or other device and addresses engagement barriers, and no studies have used this approach with high risk women. These technologies will enable us to enhance social support, provide structure, and individual tailoring. Third, we will test alternative explanations (pathways) of intervention effects on outcomes. By creating a digital weight management tool that is culturally tailored and addresses time, effort, and engagement barriers, we will increase HEAL behavior and weight loss outcomes. Focusing on cultural tailoring and engagement with a digital weight loss intervention and how to maximize it is a novel approach. Engagement is crucial to translation and dissemination of evidence- based weight loss interventions. We hypothesize that development of participant identification with the Fit4Mom program and its benefits will mediate treatment effects on behavioral and weight loss outcomes. We will ?brand? Fit4Mom and thereby build participant engagement with those behaviors, leading to improved outcomes. The study has two phases: Phase I, intervention development, and Phase II, a randomized trial. We will conduct focus group and in-depth interviews to design Fit4Mom in Phase I. In Phase II, we will recruit and randomly assign 136 overweight and obese (BMI >25 and <40kg/m2) women (ages 18-40) over a 3-month recruitment period to one of two 3-month intervention arms: 1) Fit4Mom; 2) Standard Maternal and Child Care. All recruitment will take place at MWHC. We will implement the intervention with treatment participants using social media, text messages, audience co-creation of messages, and a variety of games/contests designed to increase program engagement. The study is powered to evaluate weight loss of > 2.5kg at follow up."
"9365351","Project Summary:  While hospitalizations for older patients generally provide a net benefit when appropriate, hospitalizations for older patients also carry significant risks including an irreversible decline in both physical and cognitive functional status, often resulting in loss of quality of life and greater risk of placement in nursing homes. Elderly patients are also at increased risk of in-hospital falls, delirium, medication interactions, nosocomial infections, and medical errors. Thus, while excess use of the hospital affects all age groups, overuse of the hospital has substantially disproportionate consequences for the elderly. To this point there is little empirical data to help characterize the factors associated with admission rates for the elderly or the extent to which the complex social, cognitive, and physical factors common to elderly patients contribute to higher rates of hospitalization for patients who present for care in the Emergency Department (ED). Additionally, factors related to individual emergency physicians (EPs) who typically make the decision whether to admit or not, and the hospitals where patients present for care may further influence the likelihood of admission. Payment changes in health care also may influence rates of hospitalization for elderly patients and are crucial policy levers available to influence admissions. In particular, the recent advent of Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs) with incentives to reduce spending globally and improve quality may differentially reduce admissions.  The proposed study will utilize data on Medicare beneficiaries and their care providers to accomplish three key aims. Using nationally representative data from the Medicare program aims 1 and 2 will examine the predictors of and variation in rates of admission of elderly patients from the ED focusing on discretionary conditions. We also will examine whether factors that influence the decision to admit are also associated with adverse outcomes, including mortality and ED revisits. Potential factors will be drawn from our novel conceptual framework and include patient, EP, hospital, and market characteristics. In Aim 2, we will supplement these measures with data from the Health and Retirement Study to examine measures unique to the elderly including functional status, cognition, and social support. Aim 3 will serve as a proof of concept and will evaluate the impact of Medicare's Accountable Care Organization programs, which through systems changes as a response to payment incentives would benefit from reducing potentially discretionary admissions to the hospital.  These aims are important and timely and built upon the scientific premise that safely reducing admissions from the ED could ultimately result in improved quality of care, maintenance of independence, reduced mortality, and substantial cost savings.                          "

"9347380","Project Summary: Slip and fall accidents are a major and growing source of occupational injuries. Increasing the available coefficient of friction (ACOF) between the shoe and floor surface is an effective method for reducing slipping risk. A significant need exists for portable, cost-effective shoe-floor ACOF testing equipment that is valid for predicting slip risk. Filling this need is likely to increase the use of rigorous slip-testing in the field, customizing footwear programs to a specific workplace, and selecting the most effective footwear or flooring intervention. The overall objective of this SBIR Phase II (R44) research study is to develop a portable ACOF testing device that predicts whether a person is likely to slip with sensitivity and specificity. The feasibility of this approach is supported by preliminary development of a biofidelic slip-testing device. The potential for our approach to improve the validity of slip-testing is supported by preliminary data that found that current testing methods do not reflect the kinematics of slipping and that the under-shoe testing condition are critical to the tester's ability to predict slips. The proposed research will be accomplished with four aims: Aim 1: Identify a set of testing conditions (force, sliding speed and shoe-floor angle profiles) that best predict slip events; Aim 2: Develop a slip-tester that is portable, inexpensive and biofidelic; Aim 3: Quantify reproducibility and repeatability of the device using an interlaboratory study; and Aim 4: Validate the ability of the portable testing device to predict slipping events. Aim 1 will use previously-collected human slipping data and the biofidelic slip-tester to identify testing kinematics and kinetics that best predict slips. Aim 2 will create a portable device that uses kinematic linkage systems to achieve the testing conditions identified in Aim 1 using stepper motors and calculates ACOF based on forces measured with a load cell. Aim 2 will also include a hypothesis (H2.1) that the developed device will yield ACOF values that are well correlated with the biofidelic slip-testing device developed in Phase 1. Aim 3 will perform a multiple site interlaboratory study to quantify repeatability of the device and reproducibility across operators and devices. Aim 3 will include a hypothesis (H3.1) that differences in ACOF values will not be observed across operators and devices. Aim 4 will quantify the validity of the device for prospectively predicting human slip propensity based on ACOF data collected with the device. Aim 4 includes a hypothesis (H4.1) that the device will predict slipping risk. This proposed research is expected to lead to a state-of-the art device that will promote interventions that reduce accidental injuries due to slipping. Commercializing this innovation will position Crossroads Consulting, LLC to reach new markets for both laboratory and field slip-testing, targeting safety and occupational health consultants, smaller shoe and flooring manufactures, as well as the research community. As a result, Crossroads Consulting, LLC is anticipated to grow in size and revenues through product sales and service agreements.!"
"9352292","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Most of the causes of adolescent morbidity and mortality result from participation in health risk behaviors, such as alcohol and other drug use, smoking, sexual activity without use of protection against pregnancy or sexually transmitted diseases, and unhealthy eating patterns and physical inactivity. These behaviors frequently begin during adolescence and then persist into adulthood, thereby also influencing adult health, disease, disability, healthcare burden, and premature death. In recognition of the impact of these behaviors on adolescent and adult health, professional practice guidelines from multiple organizations recommend that Primary Care Providers screen for these behaviors and provide counseling aimed at prevention and risk reduction. Despite these recommendations and the fact that over 70% of adolescents are seen in primary care each year, adolescents with health risk behaviors are underidentified in primary care settings, and are seldom provided with risk reduction counseling or follow up interventions to decrease their risks. To address this gap in recommended care, we propose to develop and test a web-based interactive Health Assessment (iHA) for implementation in primary care settings prior to adolescent healthcare visits. The iHA is designed to: 1) conduct multi-risk screening; 2) provide personalized youth-focused prevention and risk reduction feedback; 3) summarize results, in addition to youth-reported risk behaviors, goals, and consequences for Primary Care Providers (PCPs) in order to stimulate patient-provider discussions; and 4) provide decision support for PCPs in determining the next appropriate steps in care. Personalized feedback (component #2 above) is an innovative feature of this proposed intervention, as it has demonstrated robust effectiveness in reducing risky drinking among young adults, but has not yet been tested with adolescents, nor extrapolated to health behaviors beyond substance use in healthcare settings. Health areas covered by the iHA include alcohol, tobacco and drug use; physical activity; diet; sexual health; and safety. The proposed study will recruit a sample of adolescents aged 13-18 from six primary care clinics. In Phase 1, we will optimize the iHA design and content based on formal usability testing with adolescents and primary care providers, and will develop implementation processes and training materials to promote seamless integration of iHA in primary care settings. In Phase 2, we conduct a randomized, controlled trial with 300 adolescents to examine the efficacy of this iHA on increasing the provision of prevention and risk reduction counseling during the healthcare visit, and on reducing a variety of adolescent health risk behaviors at 1 and 6 month follow ups, relative to usual care."
"9353308","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Medication errors during transition of care are common; about 50% of the patients have medication discrepancy after discharge from hospitals, and medication error associated adverse drug events are a significant source of prevent harms. The long-term goal of our effort is to develop risk-informed tools for inpatient, transitional and outpatient care providers to effectively engage and support patients to improve patient safety. The overall objective of this project is to develop a patient-centric risk model of medication errors in ambulatory care. The variability and unsatisfactory results in outcomes of transitional care programs is an indication that our knowledge of medication safety in ambulatory care settings is insufficient and excludes potentially effective intervention strategies This project is based on the assumption that human factors approaches can contribute to the understanding of underlying hazards and mitigating strategies in medication safety from a patient-centered perspective, by conceptualizing the roles of health professionals as enhancing the patient work system and supporting the patient to achieve medication safety. The project's aims are: (1) Identify hazards and mitigating strategies to medication safety using a patient work system framework; (2) Develop a patient-centric risk assessment tool through prospective qualitative studies, and (3) Evaluate the risk assessment tool in a multi-site prospective study of hazards and mitigating factors medication safety and their associations with medication discrepancies and potential adverse events. Application of human factors approach is innovative to understand the mechanisms through which system factors increase and decrease the patient's ability to self-manage safely. The epidemiology of hazards and risks in the patient work system and their association with medication safety will enhance future development and deployment of improvement strategies, such as information technology tools, patient engagement and care system design, especially in the context of accountable care for the entire continuum of care. Our project will target the expected high medication error risk periods: care transitions of vulnerable patients with high risk medications. The research team is interdisciplinary with nationally known expertise in human factors, ambulatory care medication safety, patient safety, biostatistics, hospitalist program, and primary care patient safety. Multipe study sites will be used with an expected high representation of two AHRQ priority populations: the elderly and those with low socio-economic status. We also anticipate the value of the risk model to identify specific risk factors contributing to the disparities associated in medication safety."
"9441552","Project Summary (Abstract) The Columbia-Penn Clinical Consortium (CPCC) brings together an experienced multidisciplinary team of clinical and basic scientist investigators at Columbia University Medical Center and University of Pennsylvania Transplant Programs. The CPCC investigators have expertise in the fields of transplant epidemiology, immunology, genetics and ethics, as well as an extensive history of collaboration with the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) and other CPCC member transplant programs. As a result, the CPCC is well suited to recruit and retain patients for longitudinal follow up for the APOL1 Long-term Kidney Transplantation Outcomes Research Network (APOLLO). This proposed Clinical Center will comprise of 26 pediatric and adult large, medium and small size transplant centers and 9 organ procurement organizations predominantly in four contiguous states (NY, NJ, CT and PA) in the northeast US. Our primary objective is to enroll all donors of African ancestry (e.g. African-Americans and Black Hispanic) and their recipients within the consortium for genetic and genomic studies by the APOLLO Network (Aim 1). We will follow all recruited donor-recipient pairs with longitudinal collection of biospecimens and clinical outcomes along with pragmatic integration with Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network (OPTN), UNOS and the United States Renal Data System (USRDS) data (Aim 2). Our experience in the recruitment and retention of minority patients in multicenter studies, as well as the use of innovative analytics with linkage to UNOS, USRDS and other geospatial data, will be of benefit to the APOLLO Network. We expect that our unique design and implementation expertise to the APOLLO study will address the hypothesis that the presence of two APOL1 risk variants is associated with inferior allograft outcomes following kidney transplant and increases the risk of adverse renal outcomes for affected living donors."
"9382617","Program Director/Principal Investigator (Last, First, Middle): Detloff, Megan Ryan PROJECT SUMMARY  Spinal cord injury (SCI) impairs sensory transmission leads to chronic, debilitating neuropathic pain. Chronic pain afflicts over 100 million Americans and creates an enormous burden on US health care systems, costing over half a trillion dollars annually according to a recent report from the Institute of Medicine. While our understanding of the molecular basis underlying the development of chronic pain has improved, the available therapeutics provide limited relief. After SCI, rehabilitative locomotor training is widely used in the clinical SCI population with its primary goal to promote motor recovery after SCI. In the lab, we have shown the timing of exercise is critical to meaningful sensory recovery. Early administration of a sustained locomotor exercise program in spinal cord injured rats prevents the development of neuropathic pain, while delaying similar locomotor training until pain was established was ineffective at ameliorating it. The time elapsed since the injury occurred also indicates the degree of inflammation in the dorsal horn. We have previously shown that chronic SCI and the development of neuropathic pain correspond with robust increases in microglial activation and the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines. This proposal seeks to lengthen the therapeutic window where rehabilitative exercise can successfully suppress neuropathic pain by pharmacologically reducing inflammation in dorsal root ganglia. We will administer a pharmacologic agent to dampen injury-induced inflammation acutely after SCI prior to and/or at the same time as exercise initiation after spinal cord injury. This will determine whether inflammation must be reduced prior to the initiation of exercise to suppress pain development or if it is sufficient to modulate inflammation at the time exercise is initiated. We will measure changes in the electrophysiological properties of nociceptors related to the extrinsic inflammatory environment in the DRG after SCI in the presence or absence of exercise as a treatment. Information garnered from these experiments would guide future efforts to optimize the treatment of chronic SCI-induced pain by exercise.

"9333191","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The mission of NCCAM is to define, through rigorous scientific investigation, the usefulness and safety of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) interventions and their roles in improving health and health care. The most recent Strategic Plan specifically adds the goal to Enable better evidence-based decision making regarding CAM use and its integration into health care and health promotion and the strategic objective to Improve the capacity of the field to carry out rigorous research. Over the past fifteen years NCCAM has supported research into the efficacy of CAM/integrative medicine producing a rich source of evidence that can be used for clinical decisions. To better utilize this evidence CAM institutions need to improve the quality and quantity of research education for faculty and students. This was the focus of the NCCAM R25 grant program called the 'CAM Practitioner Research Education Project Grant Partnership', which was awarded to a small number of CAM institutions in partnership with research-intensive institutions. The program was specifically focused on evidence-based medicine (EBM) by enhancing understanding and appreciation of biomedical research. This initiative was very successful, and an opportunity for dissemination to other CAM institutions now exists. The goals of this K07 project are to develop evidence informed practice (EIP) for faculty development and in the acupuncture and oriental medicine (AOM) Master's program at Pacific College of Oriental Medicine (PCOM), the largest Oriental medicine college in the US. This project will leverage the two successive R25 grants that were awarded to Northwestern Health Sciences University (NWHSU), in collaboration with the University of Minnesota, which developed EIP curricula for faculty development and their CAM programs (including AOM). The candidate will be mentored by: experts in education research and integrative medical education at Albert Einstein College of Medicine (Einstein), the sponsoring institution; and the R25 co-principal investigator and lead EIP instructor at NWHSU.

"9354437","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Rural hospitals experience unique difficulties with effective and accurate application of evidence-based patient safety solutions.1-4 Patient safety concerns arising from the identification and management of acute time-sensitive critical conditions in rural Emergency Departments (ED) are especially concerning given the high probability of harm or even death when errors occur. Well-established, evidence-based guidelines for identification and safe management of acute, time-sensitive critical conditions in the ED, such as acute sepsis, have been developed in large academic centers, yet there remain significant disparities in effective and accurate implementation and application of these guidelines and outcomes in rural EDs.2,3,5,6 Telemedicine provides a unique approach for delivering consistent, safe care to patients across all settings: from large academic to small rura hospitals.7,8 Use of telemedicine to improve patient safety in rural EDs provides unique opportunities, but also significant operational challenges, as these EDs experience continuous change with respect to patient volume, presentations of clinical conditions, as well as clinician expertise, experience, and staffing. In situ simulation, simulation that takes place in the live, operational, clinical setting with clinicians performing their real roles, provides the ability to rain and evaluate the integration of new technology, such as telemedicine, along with care guidelines, such as the acute sepsis bundle, into clinical practice and workflow. The goal of this project will be to evaluate if in situ simulation improves adoption and use of telemedicine to support implementation of the Acute Sepsis Bundle, to improve the safe delivery of care in rural EDs. We will conduct a prospective delayed intervention study to evaluate the impact of the optimized Telemedicine Acute Sepsis Bundle in two rural EDs within the Order of St. Francis (OSF) Healthcare System. The large academic center within OSF Healthcare is currently engaged in a process improvement effort to improve with safety of sepsis care, has developed and piloted an Acute Sepsis Bundle, and is committed to using telemedicine to improve dissemination in the OSF-affiliated rural hospital EDs. This project will develop, pilot, and finalize an in situ simulation training program to first tailor an optimized Telemedicine Acute Sepsis Bundle for each rural ED, and then train rural ED clinicians to integrate this new technology and care process into their workflow. We will evaluate the impact of in situ simulation on both (1) process measures: telemedicine and Acute Sepsis Bundle delivery, and (2) clinical outcomes: sepsis mortality and intensive care unit length of stay. Results will be disseminated in an In situ Simulation for Patient Safety Toolkit. This project will produce results that can be easily translated to the implementation of other new technologies and care processes targeting acute, time- sensitive critical conditions, such as stroke, acute myocardial infarction, acute decompensated heart failure, pediatric critical care, and trauma, to improve patient safety in the country's many rural EDs."
"9481441","Abstract Plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDC) are an important component of the innate immune response, contributing to the immune control of viral infections by producing large amounts of anti-viral type I interferon and modulating adaptive responses. Our laboratory has elucidated many of the key pathways in human pDC activation and maturation, especially with regard to ssRNA viruses such as HIV-1 and influenza virus. We demonstrated for the first time that pDC sense HIV-1 associated single stranded RNA through Toll-like receptor (TLR) 7, a process that requires CD4-dependent internalization into endosomal compartments where downstream IFN signaling is activated via interferon regulatory factor 7 (IRF). Despite triggering the same TLR (TLR7), HIV-1 and influenza differentially impact pDC. HIV-1 induces large amounts of type I IFN but fails to fully mature pDC into antigen presenting cells or APC (?IFN? phenotype vs ?APC? phenotype), whereas influenza induces both phenotypes. Notably, we also show that HIV-2 activates pDC to become APC, similar to influenza. HIV-2 is a naturally attenuated form of HIV, which results often in control of the virus and delayed disease development. We have now identified a set of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) that can modulate both human conventional DC (cDC) and pDC function, including their IFN and maturation/APC phenotypes. We have also described sets of IFN-inducible lncRNAs in human pDC as well as pDC-unique lncRNAs that could potentially impact pDC function in response to virus sensing. The overall goal of this application is to investigate the role of virus induced-lncRNA in pDC regulation, given that viruses can induce lncRNAs, lncRNAs are important regulators of the expression and function of genes and their encoded proteins, and that lncRNAS affect immune cell behavior, including that of dendritic cells. We hypothesize that ssRNA viruses (HIV-1, influenza, HIV-2) can impact pDC function through their differential induction of regulatory lnc-RNAs. The specific aims are to: (1) Apply RNA sequencing to identify unique virus-induced lncRNA in human pDC; (2) Functionally define lncRNA that modulate the IFN response in pDC, and (3) Mechanistically distinguish lncRNA that segregate pDC responses to HIV-1 and HIV-2. Our current knowledge about the identity and function of lncRNAs in infected innate immune cells is very limited, especially for human innate immune cells. Identifying virus inducible lncRNAs may lead to the discovery of novel cellular pathways to aid the development of therapeutic tools for the treatment and eradication of HIV-1 infection."

In a proof-of-concept publication we demonstrated a novel fiber-coupled miniature microscope that achieved 3D confocal imaging of fluorescently labeled neurons in brain tissue using electrowetting lens technology for axial focusing. This low weight instrument (<2 g) is suitable for surgical implantation to achieve all optical awake behaving recording with axial focusing deep in the mouse brain, a significant advance compared to commercially available devices. In this proposal we present a major breakthrough demonstrating successful imaging through the fiber coupled microscope using two-photon microscopy. Leveraging on this result we propose to optimize our proof of concept E-FCM (electrowetting-fiber coupled microscope) by making it compatible for two-photon excitation (2PE-FCM) suitable for recording and modulating neural activity in awake behaving mice. Our 2PE-FCM will incorporate holographic two-photon opsin stimulation with a spatial light modulator (SLM) for rapid 3D volumetric two-photon imaging and modulation of neuronal activity. Optimization of the 2PE-FCM will be achieved by regular interactions of beta users with a multidisciplinary group of physicists, engineers and neuroscientists in a parallel process of design implementation and testing the device. Testing of the 2PE-FCM will employ a step-by-step approach designed for effective generation of a device suitable for studying local circuits in different brain areas in different species. We propose a solid dissemination plan partnering with Intelligent Imaging Innovations Inc. to commercialize the device. Validation of the 2PE-FCM will be a major advance in all-optical interrogation of neural circuits creating a new venue for understanding the neural basis of behavior. Aim 1. TECHNICAL APPROACH: Optogenetic activation and simultaneous readout of deep brain neurons using a novel fiber coupled microscope with a variable focus electrowetting lens using no moving parts.

"9389822","Amy Shaub Maddox Project Summary  Our bodies are intricate ensembles of trillions of cells, and these building blocks are not generic like the bricks of a building, but rather are highly specialized. One characteristic of cells that distinguishes different types is their shape, from spherical, as in your circulating immune cells, to highly elongated, exemplified by the neurons that reach from our spines far into our legs. This project is aimed at understanding the mechanisms of cell shape change, which is crucial for many cell functions, including when a cell pinches into two after duplicating its contents.  For 40 years, we have known that cell shape is maintained by some of the same cellular chemicals that cause our muscles to contract: actin, which forms long flexible polymers, and myosin, a biological motor that turns chemical energy into movement. Throughout these decades, substantial progress has been made in understanding how cells build actin polymers and turn on myosin motors, but less is known about how these essential events are attenuated. We reasoned that, just as the electronic governor on a heavy-duty truck limits its velocity, cells have ways of limiting actin-myosin work, to tune cell shape.  In this project, we present several pieces of preliminary evidence of such cellular governors. We propose to determine the microscopic rearrangements that cause larger-scale cell shape changes, and define the chemicals that control these rearrangements. First, we demonstrate that the actin-myosin meshwork ring that pinches a cell in two does not go as fast as it can, but undergoes oscillations, speeding up and slowing down as it constricts. We routinely use powerful microscopes to observe living cells as they pinch in half, and measure the rearrangements that underlie these oscillations. Second, we will focus on the regulation of myosin, testing three distinct ideas about how its activity could be limited. Last, we present three new directions for the old field of studying cells pinching in half. To discover new candidate governors, we combined several technologies in ?fishing expedition? projects, which we have already completed. This unbiased but risky work laid well- substantiated groundwork for our functional studies of these new candidates.  In sum, this project will take our field of cell pinching into novel territory, and will be relevant to the study of situations wherein cells purposefully arrest the pinching process, such as the generation of the specialized cells in your liver and heart muscle. Our findings will also contribute general principles of cell change shape, and thus help us understand normal development and diseases. Our discoveries may, in the long term, inform the development of therapies for pathologies involving cell shape regulation, such as cancers and blood diseases."
"9302964","Project Summary Metastasis accounts for over 90% of all cancer associated suffering and death, and arguably presents the most formidable challenges in cancer management. The central innovation and overall goal of this project is the development of new design radiotherapy biomaterials that could be employed to significantly boost pancreatic/lung/prostate cancer cure rate: including treatment of metastasis and overcoming radioresistance, all at no additional inconvenience to patients. The new biomaterials are designed to simply replace the inert biomaterials (fiducials/spacers), which are currently routinely implanted to ensure spatial accuracy during radiotherapy. These new biomaterials specifically incorporate a payload of non-toxic targeted radiosensitizing gold nanoparticles (GNP), and immunoadjuvants in a biodegradable polymer matrix. Once in place, the new design biomaterials controllably release the payload directly into the tumor as the polymer degrades. During radiotherapy, the released GNP will significantly enhance local tumor cell kill, substantially boosting dose to radioresistant tumor cells via Einstein?s photoelectric effect, with minimal toxicity to healthy tissue. Meanwhile, antigens from irradiated tumor cells work with the released immunoadjuvant to prime a robust T cell response, which may kill metastatic cells distant from the irradiated site (abscopal effect) and establish immune memory to prevent cancer recurrence. Slow in-situ release of the payload will minimize systemic/overlapping toxicities, which are currently a critical barrier/concern with competing approaches. Overall, our low risk, potential high-reward innovation could significantly enhance survival and quality of life for pancreatic/ung/prostate cancer patients."
"9470221","ABSTRACT  This mixed-methods study utilizes a dynamic combination of large secondary data sets and qualitative data collection, to garner a sophisticated understanding of the relationships between Religion and Spirituality (R/S) and Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) risk factors. CVD risk factors, especially high blood pressure, obesity, diabetes and depression, disproportionately affect African Americans in prevalence and/or severity, contributing to the higher associated mortality rate. Further, examining lifestyle choices (for example, diet and exercise) without appropriate sociocultural context does not provide practice-ready solutions on the manifestations, root causes and potential strategies for eliminating African American?s heightened CVD risks. As such, religion and spirituality (R/S) in the African American community have been acknowledged for their positive influence on social behaviors and emotional health, but have not been sufficiently examined for their role in attenuating or exacerbating physical health outcomes and in particular, the risks associated with CVD. Most research has compared the relationship between R/S and health outcomes by examining the specific denominations of their White participants, and blanketed Black participants? religion to the ?Black Church.? This approach disregards the diversity of beliefs, behaviors and ways of thinking found in the religious affiliation and denominations of African Americans. In a rare project that examined Black health outcomes in relation to specific religious affiliation/denomination, it was revealed that religious attendance had an inverse relationship based upon religious affiliation/denomination on black mortality rates not found in white participants. Thus, the standard of relying on religious affiliation and health studies based on White participants to determine expected outcomes for Black participants is likely to cause inaccuracies in research and interventions. The overarching goals of this research are to investigate the extent to which R/S is related to CVD risk factors (obesity, diabetes, hypertension and depression) through the use of robust secondary and primary data analysis. The two project Aims will use theoretically-, research- and data-driven evidence to bolster efforts to decrease CVD risk factors and improve health outcomes for African Americans. Aim 1 utilizes structural equational modeling to determine if R/S has direct and indirect effects on CVD risk factors through health behaviors. Aim 2 establishes how the relationships manifest through first-hand accounts of the attributes of specific denominations on the health outcomes of its congregants, thus allowing participants to explain how the relationships found in Aim 1 are manifested-or not, in their daily and R/S life. The purpose of this research project is to not only identify the direct and indirect relationships between CVD risk factors and R/S, but to provide in depth knowledge of core attitudes, beliefs, organizational structures, and/or practices that facilitate or attenuate positive health outcomes for African Americans. The precision and nuance of our project?s strategies will fill in significant gaps in research and practice that can be a catalyst for evidence-based interventions that examines of community and religious institutions to support positive health outcomes for African American."
"9562162","The biological underpinnings of Motoric Cognitive Risk syndrome: a multi-center study Motoric Cognitive Risk syndrome (MCR) is a recently described pre-dementia syndrome, characterized by the presence of subjective cognitive complaints and slow gait. MCR affects almost in 1 in 10 older adults, and has a high incidence in aging. MCR predicts risk of developing both Alzheimer?s disease (AD) and vascular dementia even after accounting for clinical overlap with Mild Cognitive Impairment syndrome (MCI). Unlike MCI, complex cognitive tests or assays are not required for diagnosing MCR, increasing its clinical utility. MCR has incremental predictive validity for dementia over its individual cognitive (cognitive complaints) and motoric (slow gait) components. While the epidemiology of MCR has been described, the biological underpinnings and neural substrates of MCR are not yet established. We draw together a multidisciplinary team to comprehensively conduct the first study to examine the pathogenesis of MCR syndrome. The MCR consortium includes an estimated 10,080 older individuals from 8 cohorts in USA, Canada, Europe, Asia and Australia. The MCR consortium has collaborated, shared and harmonized data, and published on MCR topics, establishing feasibility. Aim 1. Identify biological mechanisms underlying MCR incidence. Elevated peripheral inflammatory and oxidative stress biomarkers as well as single nucleotide polymorphisms in these pathways predicted incident MCR in our pilot studies. We will prospectively examine the role of inflammatory and oxidative stress biomarkers and explore genetic variants in these and related pathways in the pathogenesis of MCR. We will report associations in individual cohorts and as a second step in the pooled sample of 9,370 individuals in our MCR consortium with biomarker/genetic assays available or planned. Aim 2. Establish brain pathologies and substrates of MCR syndrome. Based on studies linking cerebral small vessel disease to cortical thinning, we hypothesize that cerebral small vessel disease (lacunar infarctions, cerebral microbleeds and white matter hyperintensities) may accelerate or incite gray matter loss that will clinically manifest as MCR. This aim will be prospectively tested using advanced imaging acquisition and analytical methods in individual cohorts and secondarily in the pooled sample of 3,100 individuals with neuroimaging. Aim 3. Compare and contrast biology and brain substrates for MCR and MCI syndromes. We will explore similarities and differences in new biological associations discovered in Aims 1 & 2 as well as known AD risk factors (APOE, hippocampal atrophy, etc.) with MCR and MCI. There is only partial clinical overlap between MCR and MCI. While we expect partial biological overlap, our studies show exclusive genetic predispositions, brain pathologies and brain substrates for MCR not seen with MCI. The MCR syndrome is not conceptualized as an alternate to MCI but complementary. Discovering unique biological associations of MCR may lead to new treatments that complement current MCI preventions. Our proposal is highly responsive to PAR-17-054: As per the PAR guidelines, we will use and/or harmonize existing data, collect new biological and imaging data not present in all cohorts, and add new participants as well as extend follow-up in 8 cohorts to clarify risk and protective factors for AD and related dementias via the MCR pathway. Our proposal also meets several action priorities of the National Alzheimer Plan such as accelerating efforts to identify early stages of AD, identifying biological mechanisms underlying dementia, expanding genetic epidemiology research to identify risk factors, and expanding international outreach to enhance collaboration."

"9460794","ABSTRACT Cannabis use disorder (CUD) is a well-recognized syndrome characterized by tolerance and withdrawal. Repeated cannabis exposure is associated with downregulation and desensitization of the brain endocannabinoid (eCB) system. While several medications have been tested for CUD, none are U/S Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved or clinically accepted. Substitution treatment while showing some promise in reducing the cannabis withdrawal syndrome (CWS), is limited by its psychoactive effects, abuse liability, and by its limited relapse prevention effects. In individuals with CUD, in vivo imaging studies have demonstrated: 1) lower brain cannabinoid receptors (CB1R) and 2) lower levels of the eCB-metabolizing enzyme fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) which is responsible for degrading anandamide (AEA), a principal endogenous ligand of the cannabinoid system. Thus, an alternative to substitution treatment may be to potentiate signaling through the eCB system to restore eCB tone that is altered with chronic cannabis exposure. FAAH inhibitors which increase AEA levels reduce CWS in THC-dependent animals. PF-04457845 is an orally active, long- acting, potent, and selective FAAH inhibitor. In our completed proof of concept (POC), double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, inpatient/outpatient study relative to placebo, the FAAH inhibitor PF-04457845 (4mg QD) administered for 4 weeks reduced 1) cannabis withdrawal, 2) cannabis use, and 3) disturbances in sleep, in DSM-4 cannabis dependent individuals (n=60). PF-04457845 was very well-tolerated and was not rewarding/reinforcing. Hypotheses: PF-04457845 will reduce cannabis use, withdrawal symptoms, and sleep disturbances including time in Stage N3 sleep, in treatment-seeking individuals with a cannabis use disorder (CUD). Approach: The efficacy and safety of PF-04457845 (4 mg QD) on cannabis use will be studied in treatment- seeking male and female CUD subjects (n= 260 [including 25% attrition]) in a placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized, multicenter, 12-week long (8 weeks of treatment & 4 weeks follow up) parallel-group study. Innovation: The proposed treatment for CUD is based on a plausible and novel mechanism (i.e., FAAH inhibition) that will restore eCB tone, thereby reducing cannabis use and the withdrawal syndrome. There are very few FAAH-inhibitors that are available or approved for use in humans, and none are available commercially. The proposed study builds on the promising findings of a completed POC study with the same drug at the same dose."
"9387186","Project Summary/Abstract Title: Molecular Determinants of Social Factors in Prostate Cancer  Prostate cancer disproportionately affects African American (AA) men with higher incidence, mortality and aggressive disease. Socioeconomic status (SES) and social stress such as neighborhood factors are widely regarded as the foremost driver of such health disparities however their association and translation to biological stress and mechanisms on pathogenesis are poorly understood. Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA) modulates stress response and has been suggested to mediate social stress induced effects on cellular physiology racial disparities in cancer outcomes. HPA-axis modulates cortisol levels controlling the glucocorticoid (GC) response following a social stress. In addition to cortisol, Leptin levels have been also demonstrated as effectors of stress response. Such stress hormones can modulate cancel cell signaling affecting pathogenesis and outcomes. MicroRNAs are epigenetic elements that are highly stable noncoding small 21-23nt gene- regulatory RNAs acting primarily by targeting 3?UTRs; their roles have been studied in cancer cell survival, proliferation, and metastasis as well as biomarkers of resistance and aggressive PCa. We have recently identified racially distinct differentially expressed miRNAs in PCa tissues and body fluids (serum and urine) as potential biomarker. Both Glucocorticoid and leptin signaling have been shown to affect the expression of miRNAs in human and laboratory models. In this proposal, we will test the hypothesize that social and neighborhood factors translate into continuous biological stress perturbing the levels of stress hormones such as cortisol and leptin resulting in alteration of epigenetic machinery including expression of miRNAs. The proposal will analyze circulating microRNAs and stress hormone levels in African American (AA) prostate cancer patients of the Washington DC metro area with differential socioeconomic status and social stress. Next, we will study the interplay between stress hormones and selected microRNAs in modulating cancer hallmarks. Finally, we will study miRNA-targets-stress markers by identifying miRNA targets and pathways involved to mechanistically characterize selected miRNAs for pathways modulated during social stress. This study will bridge the gap between social factors and biological determinants by studying logical epigenetic mechanisms modulated by social stress and causing health disparities. Understanding these biological implications of social stress will significantly impact diagnosis, prognosis and treatment development for aggressive PCa in African Americans."
"9332472","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The protein composition of synapses is exquisitely regulated to maintain healthy brain function. The synapse contains diverse set of centrally important transmembrane proteins, including neurotransmitter receptors, cell adhesion molecules, and ion channels. The precise architectural organization of these components establish postsynaptic function. The broad goal of this proposal is to understand how these critical postsynaptic proteins concentrate within excitatory synapses, and how regulation of their number and position contribute to mechanisms of neural plasticity in health and disease. Of particular importance is regulation of the AMPA-type glutamate receptors (AMPARs), because the number of activated AMPARs is controlled and modulated during many forms of neural plasticity. AMPARs diffuse freely on the neuronal surface membrane, and enter and exit the postsynaptic density (PSD) via this mechanism. In order to sustain synaptic strength, the synapse slows mobility of receptors to retain them. Unfortunately, despite intensive investigation, the mechanisms governing intrasynaptic receptor mobility remain unclear. Compelling data including high resolution imaging of receptor lateral movement suggest that binding to partners within the PSD, notably the scaffold PSD-95, is essential for receptor accumulation. However, numerical modeling and indirect experimental evidence suggest an alternative possibility, i.e. the synapse is so dense with proteins that this obstacle field prevens receptors from escaping. Nevertheless, this mechanism (intrasynaptic steric hindrance of receptors) is poorly understood and has not been systematically addressed. Motivated by these observations, I hypothesize that steric hindrance and biochemical binding in the PSD act in combination to regulate the mobility of synaptic transmembrane proteins like receptors. I have combined two single-molecule imaging approaches that permit discrimination of protein mobility within and around synapses with the necessary, nanometer-scale resolution. Using these approaches to monitor motion of a uniquely designed set of transmembrane protein probes will allow me to examine the influence of binding and steric hindrance separately. If the synaptic environment exerts steric influence on proteins entering the PSD, the effect should depend on protein size. The first set of experiments tests this prediction by altering the extracellular sizeof an otherwise identical binding-deficient transmembrane protein, and tracking their movements in the living synapse. I then assess whether steric hindrance in the extracellular and intracellular environment in the synapse could have different effects on receptor mobility, by altering the bulk size of the same protein on either side of the membrane and tracking their movements in the living synapse. The next experiments test the sufficiency of synaptic binding to slow transmembrane protein by following the movements of a small, generic transmembrane protein carrying a ligand which can bind to PSD- 95.

Recent advances in technologies for cloning adult stem cells resident in normal, regenerative epithelia have been adapted to cloning stem cells from Barrett's esophagus. Investigators in the proposed Center have now extended this technology, in preliminary studies, to cloning the stem cells of dysplastic Barrett's and adenocarcinoma itself. The impact of this technology for resolving key questions in Barrett's and cancer biology in general, including the precise steps in tumorigenesis from precursor lesions, the functional and genomic intra-tumor heterogeneity and its impact on chemotherapy resistance, and lastly the nature and targetability of stem cells of precursor lesions and frank adenocarcinoma, is potentially transformative. As potentially transformative is a biorepository that exploits the regenerative and clonal nature of these stem cells to extend our knowledge of discrete cases in parallel fashion. In Aim 1, we will generate high-density arrays of stem cell clones corresponding to a topological sampling across four mucosal resections of patients with early adenocarcinoma. Aim 2 will generate large libraries of cancer stem cells from advanced cases of esophageal adenocarcinoma. Aim 3 will generate an interactive database that links datasets from both the arrays of clones derived from mucosal resections as well as those associated with analyses of the cancer stem cell libraries. We anticipate that such a virtual database of datasets would greatly augment downstream studies with the same libraries and discrete clones as each would come with such linked datasets that would be further extended by ongoing and future studies by investigators within the Center and across the community.

"9355048","DESCRIPTION:      Abstract Cervical spinal cord injury (C-SCI) is a common and frequently devastating battlefield injury that can result in a broad range of life-long locomotor, spasticity, and pain disabilities. Although SCI involves a cascade of numerous pathophysiological events that evolve over time, research aimed at therapy development has almost exclusively focused on single therapies which have failed in multicenter clinical trials to decrease physical assistance required for locomotion. Positive therapeutic benefits have been reported for locomotor therapy and, independently, for therapy utilizing transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to reduce disability in a variety of neurologic conditions. The proposed studies are designed to test the potential for the combination of locomotor training and TMS to produce convergent amplification of endogenous neuroplastic and repair mechanisms to significantly enhance locomotor recovery, and reduce spasticity, gait and pain disability. Spasticity is one of the more common complications of SCI for which new therapeutic avenues are continually being pursued. Multidisciplinary studies will quantitate therapeutic impact on disability, changes in underlying mechanisms, and provide comprehensive neurological and physiological safety assessments at acute and chronic therapeutic windows using a range of doses and combinations. Three complementary specific aims are proposed that are based upon supporting preliminary data and which will employ a battery of state of the art multi-organ systems monitoring, behavioral, neurophysiological, immunohistochemical (IHC), and molecular-based techniques that have been extensively employed in this laboratory. In this proposal we aim to: 1) compare the efficacy and safety of single pulse TMS of the spinal cord (SC) (TMSsc), and treadmill locomotor training (Tm), tested alone and in combination in acute C-SCI on the excitability of stretch reflexes, gait kinematics, pain sensitivity, and selected measures of physiological safety, 2) compare the efficacy of TMSsc and Tm locomotor training, tested alone and in combination in chronic C-SCI on spasticity, on gait kinematics and pain sensitivity, 3) identify key neurobiological processes (particularly, therapy induced up-regulation of specific signaling mechanisms) correlated with changes induced by injury and treatment in regard to spasticity, gait, and pain. Immunohistochemical (IHC) and molecular expression of three factors that are essential for normal pattern of presynaptic and postsynaptic inhibition: GABA/GABAb receptors and descending noradrenergic (NE) fiber projection. In addition, specific molecular markers for pain (GCH1, GTP cyclohydrolase 1; SP, Substance P; CGRP, calcitonin gene-related peptide, a marker for pain and sprouting of SC afferents; Isolectin B4, IB4, marker for microglia) will be tested. Hypothesis: We propose that therapy induced normalization of spasticity measures will in part, be mediated by increased rate-dependent inhibition in the SC circuits, and these neurophysiological measures will correlate with significant up-regulation of immuno-expression of GABA/GABAb receptors and NE. We propose that therapy induced normalization of outcome measures for pain will correlate with reduced immune-expression of pain markers GCH1, SP, CGRP, and IB4. Translation of these findings and the demonstration of benefit from locomotor and TMSsc therapies could lead to more specific and potentially more effective locomotor therapy clinical trials in combat C-SCI patients which ultimately benefit the veterans' health care  system."

"9482979","ABSTRACT Recent efforts to identify and circumvent mechanisms of drug resistance point to the role of HER2 truncated isoforms, which lack the extracellular domain of the full-length protein targeted by trastuzumab. Understanding the biology of HER2 isoforms is crucial to developing new drugs personalized for individuals resistant to trastuzumab therapy. However, detection of these isoforms in paraffin-embedded tissue sections (FFPE) is impossible by conventional methods (Immunohistochemistry, IHC) due to the lack of isoform-specific antibodies and the loss of epitope integrity during tissue processing. To overcome these barriers, the goal of this project is to develop a robust tool that will both allow retrospective studies on HER2 isoforms and enable isoform screening on a patient-to-patient basis to tailor breast cancer treatment. Our efforts fill a major gap in cancer research: the limited ability to scrutinize tissue sections for protein targets that either lack highly specific antibody probes (analytical) or lose epitope integrity during tissue processing (pre- analytical). We introduce a whole-tissue western blot (wtWestern) that creates a novel 3D protein ?imprint? of the tissue section for stable storage and downstream antibody probing. The unique dual-functionality wtWestern electrophoretically resolves proteins (extracted from a 2D tissue section) along the depth (z-axis) of a supporting photoactive hydrogel layer. Exposure to UV light covalently links protein to the hydrogel. We benchmark the fixative-free imprint for biobanking suitability, apply the wtWestern to measurement of proteins (including isoforms) in archived frozen or FFPE tissue sections, and maximize tissue utility by enabling detection of 20+ proteins for cancer sub-type classification. This innovative wtWestern is expected to maximize the quality and utility of biospecimens for downstream analyses ? critically important to retrospective studies that form the basis for both cancer diagnostics/prognostics and personalized medicine."
"9516638","ABSTRACT This revision application entitled ?Regeneration of acutely injured lungs using adult human stem cells? is to expand the scope of the parent grant ?Modeling, pathogenesis and treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis? into studies that will further regenerative medicine and accelerate its use by developing an adult stem cell therapy for acute lung injury. The treatment modality we propose is to regenerate acutely injured lungs by targeted removal of damaged pulmonary epithelium (while preserving lung vasculature and surrounding parenchymal tissue), followed by delivery of iPSC-derived pulmonary cells. Both the parent grant and this application are based on three highly innovative translational technologies recently developed in our labs: (i) derivation of large numbers of pulmonary progenitors from adult human iPSCs, (ii) prolongation of ex vivo lung support from 6 hours to 3?5 days by normothermic cross-circulation, and (iii) a non- invasive theranostic system for real-time monitoring of cell delivery and lung regeneration. For maximal significance, we focus on one of the most common causes of acute lung injury - gastric aspiration - that frequently leads to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). For maximal translational potential, we chose to develop an in-situ approach to lung regeneration, where an interventional procedure will be performed in the patient, by replacing defective cells in the region(s) of injury with therapeutic human iPSC-derived pulmonary cells using a very thin, flexible, imaging-guided bronchoscope. We will study lung regeneration ex vivo under cross-circulation and ventilation (over 3?5 days) and in situ (over 1 month) in a clinically relevant porcine model, using protocols established in our previous and preliminary studies. The project is designed to collect data for preparing the IRB/FDA applications for Phase I human trials to treat acute lung injury with therapeutic human iPSC-derived pulmonary cells by the end of the 1-year grant."
"9439657","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The e4 allele of the Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) gene has been identified as one of the strongest genetic determinants of late-onset Alzheimer?s disease (AD). In general, the e4 allele is associated with reductions in neural protection and repair, increasing a carrier?s vulnerability to damage accumulated over his/her lifetime. Nevertheless, while the penetrance of ApoE e4 is relatively high, a significant proportion of e4 carriers will never develop AD. The overall goal of this project is to model interactions across multiple omics networks to identify the biological pathways involved in sporadic AD susceptibility versus resilience among high-risk individuals. The multifactorial nature of AD suggests that it may manifest as a result of complex interactions across the genome, epigenome, transcriptome, and proteome. Identifying the central networks involved in AD pathogenesis will require integrative Systems Biology approaches. The proposed research offers a new and innovative way to integrate networks?a dominant feature in biology?across multiple tissues and omics platforms, in order to identify innate and dynamic precursors of resilience to AD, among a high-risk population (e4+). Towards this goal, we will: (1) employ newly developed GWAS-based network analysis, to identify SNP networks that alter the association between ApoE e4 and cognitive decline/dementia; (2) generate DNA methylation and RNA-seq data from brain samples that we will analyze using weighted gene correlation network analysis (WGCNA) to identify networks associated with AD neuropathology and cognitive decline among ApoE e4+; (3) generate proteomic data from brain and CSF samples that we will analyze using WGCNA to identify networks associated with AD neuropathology and cognitive decline among ApoE e4+; (4) use advanced integromic network analysis to identify multi-omics and multi-tissue pathways and biological systems involved in AD resilience. The integration of multiple 'omics' data using systems biology will be crucial for unraveling the connections and interactions between various functional levels involved in complex diseases, such as AD. Overall, our proposed research will improve understanding of the complex biology underlying AD susceptibility. These studies have the potential to identify novel therapeutic targets that could inform the development of future pharmacologic interventions aimed at preventing or slowing AD pathogenesis."
"9472452","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT This is a new multi-PI proposal from our California Spinal Cord Injury (SCI) consortium to continue to translate exciting results from the transplantation of neural stem cells (NSCs) from rodent to primate, and to evaluate efficacy and safety in our non-human primate (NHP) cervical contusion SCI model. Our multi-center consortium has examined recovery of function and its anatomical correlates in a series of studies using a cervical hemisection model. We have discovered spontaneous and extensive plasticity of the corticospinal tract (CST) system that had not been appreciated in previous rodent studies. We have developed the first large NHP model of cervical hemicontusion SCI together with an open-field scoring system and novel in-cage forelimb activity and hand function tests to evaluate functional outcomes. The wealth of new information and directions speak to the value of this shared approach to using the very valuable primate model. This project focuses on translation of our NHP stem cell work. We now report that neural stem cells (NSCs) derived from human spinal cord grafted early to hemisection sites in NHP SCI, extend very large numbers of axons over very long distances, and that these transplants appear to enhance long-term recovery of hand function, and support CST regeneration into the graft. NSCs derived from the approved human embryonic stem cell H9 (H9 hESCNSCs) also support CST regeneration into spinal cord grafts in the NHP after SCI. Further, we have advanced our cell therapy strategy to produce the first H9 hESCNSCs caudalized to move them towards a spinal cord fate, and have shown that transplants of these cells in rodents promote much more vigorous regeneration of CST axons7. Therefore, in this proposal in NHPs, we will transplant caudalized hESCNSCs into a contusion lesion at a more chronic and clinically relevant six week time point. We hypothesize that these grafts will support robust CST regeneration and enhance recovery of forelimb function, and provide a relay for CST axons to influence forelimb circuitry in the C8-T1 cord. We will use anterograde and retrograde tracing, IHC and transfection of graft cells and correlate the connectional data with recovery, and test the long-term survival, safety, and functional effects of these transplants."
"9390172","Project Summary After stunning improvements in patient outcomes for most childhood cancers in the latter half of the last century, cure rates have plateaued. Children with metastatic solid malignancies continue to have a less than 50% chance of survival despite being treated with highly intensive cytotoxic therapies. Neuroblastoma (NB), a diverse malignancy affecting very young children that arises from the developing sympathetic nervous system, is responsible for a disproportionate amount of morbidity and mortality attributable to childhood cancer and is the main focus of the Maris translational research program. Our primary motivation is to improve patient outcomes, and we also deem NB an outstanding model of cancer in general, such that discoveries of basic mechanisms of tumorigenesis are broadly applicable to other human malignancies. Over the next seven years, the Maris lab will seek to substantively improve cure rates for patients with through a multidisciplinary and collaborative research program. Our broad goal is to discover the fundamental mechanisms that subvert normal neural development and orchestrate NB tumorigenesis, and then to translate this knowledge into patient-specific therapies that will be more effective and less toxic. We thus have a comprehensive approach with six highly integrated major research efforts planned over the next seven years. 1) Genetic susceptibility to NB. Our lab has discovered the majority of NB predisposition genes using genetic approaches. We will now define the mechanisms by which DNA variation cause malignant transformation via epistatic deregulation of normal developmental pathways using epigenomics approaches. 2) NB genomics and clonal evolution. Our lab has led the collaborative efforts to define the genomic landscape of diagnostic high-risk NB. We will now focus on NB as a dynamic ecosystem, defining how tumors adapt to the selective pressure of therapy. 3) NB drug development. The Maris lab has utilized genomic data and genetic screens to define oncogenic vulnerabilities, and many of these have been translated to the clinic. We will now focus on defining mechanisms of therapy resistance to both standard of care agents and the targeted therapies we develop. 4) Immunogenomics. The Maris lab has used an integrative approach to discover several new immunotherapeutic targets in NB. We will now intensively focus on developing antibodies, antibody drug conjugate and adoptive T-cell therapies to these targets designed to eradicate NB safely. 5) Precision NB therapies. We have developed biomarker-directed clinical trials for children with relapsed NB, and will continue our efforts here both in the relapse and newly diagnosed setting using clinical trials designed to enrich for patients most likely to benefit. We think that our research program proposes a variety of innovative experimental strategies to uncover basic mechanisms of oncogenesis, kinome reprogramming, epigenetic adaptation and immune evasion, and is steadfastly translational. The significance of the proposed program is the discovery of fundamental mechanisms of NB tumorigenesis that will lead to markedly improved probability of cure coupled with reduced morbidity."
"9376404","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The Affordable Care Act (ACA) has special implications for behavioral health, through expanded coverage, legislative mandates specific to behavioral health, and behavioral health parity with medical and surgical benefits. These changes to behavioral health coverage have the potential to shift the treatment landscape for mental health and substance use disorders. Behavioral health benefits are critical to HIV+ individuals, because mental health and substance use disorders are highly prevalent. Untreated substance use and psychiatric disorders have both been associated with poor general and HIV-related health outcomes and with increased population-level transmission of HIV. In addition, mental health conditions are often co-morbid with substance use disorders. Consequently, developing an evidence base for behavioral health will have implications for policymakers seeking to ensure availability of appropriate care for two, often strongly comorbid, groups of treatable conditions. Few studies have examined the effects of the ACA on the health outcomes of people with HIV, and there are no studies on changes in their behavioral health and ACA implementation. The overarching objective of this study is to estimate and interpret the effects of the ACA on behavioral health service utilization and behavioral health outcomes in people with HIV. The quantitative component of this study will estimate the effects of ACA implementation on mental health and corresponding treatment, with a focus on depressive symptoms, in addition to substance use disorders, examining alcohol use, illicit drug use, and associated treatment. Finally, the aims of this study include a qualitative component, which is also the focus of the proposed training plan. The qualitative aim will assess awareness and perception of the ACA's effects on behavioral health coverage and care by conducting in-depth interviews with people with HIV and behavioral health needs. This mixed-methods approach leverages the quantitative data from two longitudinal studies of HIV infection with in-depth interviews with a subset of HIV+ study participants to estimate and interpret behavioral health trends. This study will be the first to examine the effects of the ACA on the behavioral health of people with HIV and will contribute to a nuanced evidence base of the shifting behavioral health services landscape, the behavioral health needs of people with HIV, and remaining barriers to behavioral health care. These aims align with AHRQ funding priorities in that they will examine changing access to behavioral health care and associated health outcomes in a priority population of people with HIV who have behavioral health needs. In addition to the research aims, this project will provide me with the training and mentorship to apply mixed methods approaches to new questions on policy and health insurance in people with HIV. I am confident that the research project, training, and mentorship that I will receive under this fellowship will position me to submit a K series award, to continue studying the effects of health policies on vulnerable populations."
"9470983","Project Summary In-hospital cardiac arrests (IHCA) represent catastrophic, often terminal events and affect up to 700,000 patients annually. Despite the resources and opportunity to intervene early when cardiac arrests occur, fewer than a quarter of patients survive to discharge, and survival varies significantly across institutions and by race. Black patients, in particular, experience up to 12% lower odds of survival and more pronounced neurologic and functional impairment following a cardiac arrest. Disparities in cardiac arrest outcomes are largely attributed to quality gaps at the institutions where minorities receive care. Variations in the process of care delivery in these settings suggests that hospitals where Blacks receive care may be fundamentally different in their ability to detect and prevent death and significant debilitation. Our study will examine institutional mechanisms underlying IHCA disparities through a focused examination of front line care providers. In the hospital, nurses are the primary clinical surveillance system and play an integral role in the initiation and delivery of emergency responses. Nurses are at the bedside 24 hours a day; they are responsible for early warning system monitoring; they have direct knowledge of patient conditions and changes in conditions and are often the first on the scene of a cardiac arrest. The ability for nurses to respond appropriately to acute changes in patient status has been linked to nursing organizational factors, including nurse staffing, nurse education, nursing skill mix, and the nurse work environment. The relationship between the organization of nursing and minority IHCA outcomes, however, is unknown. We posit that nurses play a significant, yet underexplored, role in IHCA patient outcomes, and that variation in nursing across hospitals may help explain IHCA outcome disparities. To examine this relationship, we take advantage of multiple large and unique databases: The American Heart Association's Get with the Guidelines?Resuscitation (GWTG-R) clinical registry and the NINR-funded RN4CAST-US studies (R01-NR004513 and R01-NR014855). The clinical registry incorporates uniformly reported and precisely defined clinical variables developed by international experts. Using unique hospital identifiers to link patient outcomes with measures of nursing care from RN4CAST-US, we will identify specific, actionable elements of nursing that influence minority IHCA patient outcomes. The data set that we will assemble includes nurse survey data collected in 2006 and 2015. Using independent cross-sections of tens of thousands of patients in the same large sample of hospitals, enables us to examine trends and relationships between nursing and minority IHCA outcomes and determine if they vary over time. Knowing whether these associations are stable and enduring, in spite of changes in both patient case-mix and acuity and in the nursing characteristics that may be greater in some hospitals than others, will provide stronger evidence that the associations are persistent and that our results are generalizable."
"9295733","Project Summary Pesticides are biocidal, principally neurotoxic chemicals commonly used in the USA and throughout the world for agriculture, landscaping, household use, and insect-born disease control. Because many pesticides have been linked to risk for various neurological disorders, the proper determination of safe exposure levels for each pesticide is critical to public health. Recent epidemiological studies in our lab and others have linked perinatal exposure to pyrethroid pesticides with increased risk for autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in children. Our lab has also demonstrated that mice exposed to pyrethroid concentrations below the EPA ?no observable adverse effect? level have alterations in dopamine (DA) release, storage, and trafficking, as well as an ADHD-related behavioral phenotype. Critically, no existing animal study has evaluated the impact of pyrethroid exposure on social behaviors relevant to psychiatric disorders like ASD. There is a critical knowledge gap regarding the full extent of the behavioral and neurophysiological phenotypes caused by low-dose exposure to pyrethroids and relevant to ADHD and ASD risk. To address this knowledge gap, we will take advantage of the extraordinary expertise of the Miller lab in neurotoxicology, as well as my expertise in complex social behavior and the prairie vole, an animal model with unique social behaviors considered translationally relevant to ASD. We propose to study the effects of developmental pyrethroid exposure on neurophysiology and behavior in translational animal models relevant to human psychiatric disorders. In Aim 1, we will determine the behavioral phenotype of pyrethroid-exposed mice by testing for a broad range of behavioral deficits relevant to ASD, including social interaction, communication, repetitive behaviors, and the new generation of empathy-based behavioral tests. In Aim 2, we will use a wide range of morphological, neurochemical and electrophysiological techniques to determine the neurophysiological changes in DA storage and release in pyrethroid-exposed mice. In Aim 3, I will carry these same techniques into my independent research program, where I will use them to determine the critical disruptions in DAT in pyrethroid-exposed mice. In Aim 4, I will more fully develop my independent research program by determining the behavioral and neurophysiological phenotype of pyrethroid exposed prairie voles, focusing on alterations in unique social behaviors shared between human and vole, including social bonding, spontaneous parental care, and empathy-based consoling behavior. This project is designed to develop a successful long-term research program focused on the contribution of environmental toxins to risk for psychiatric disease. This will involve a substantial training and career development program led by primary mentor Dr. Gary Miller, an expert in neurotoxicology; and involving a mentoring team consisting of Dr. Shannon Gourley, an expert on animal models of psychopathy and psychiatric disease; Dr. Donald Rainnie, an expert on neurodevelopment and electrophysiology; and Dr. Michael Caudle, a toxicologist and expert on mouse models of developmental toxic exposure. In addition to their expert guidance and mentorship, Dr. Gourley will contribute her significant expertise on spine density morphometry and analysis, and Dr. Rainnie will contribute his significant expertise on whole cell patch clamp. Completion of these Aims, along with the extensive training and career development plan outlined in this proposal, will help to build an innovative, productive, and long-term research program focused on the contribution of environmental toxicants to risk for psychiatric and neurological disorders, which may inform treatments, preventive measures and regulations."

Project 2 will extend these studies by transferring technical expertise for designing and validating field deployable polymerase chain reaction (PCR) based nucleic acid assays and recombinant antigen based immunoassays. In Milestone 1 we will transfer technology and provide training for the development and validation of field deployable quantitative PCR tests for known and novel pathogens to enhance clinical care. Transfer of technology and training for the development and validation of field deployable immunoassays for known and novel pathogens to allow for rapid diagnosis across many sites will be provided in Milestone 2. In Milestone 3 we will perform sample collection, surveillance and investigation of the epidemiology of known and novel pathogens in Senegal, Sierra Leone and Nigeria. The availability of these diagnostic assays will improve clinical care, and enable enhanced surveillance and investigation of the epidemiology of known and novel viruses, as well as other microbial pathogens contributing to the infectious disease burden in West Africa. 1"
"9565798","PROJECT DESCRIPTION Aneurysm contributes significantly to mortality in patients with polycystic kidney disease (PKD). Thus, a better understanding of vascular pathology in PKD may lead to prevention and treatment for these patients. Primary cilia are known to be the mechanosensory organelles in vascular endothelia. Emerging evidence indicates that primary cilia are involved in PKD pathogenesis. Using inducible-PKD models for endothelia, the proposed study is designed to ask if and how improving cilia function could diminish aneurysm formation. Therefore, our hypothesis is to test PKD models to determine if enhancing cilia function will significantly prevent aneurysm formation. Since our previous studies indicated that activation of ciliary dopamine receptor-5 (DR5) could enhance the mechanosensory function of primary cilia, our Aim 1 will use DR5 as a candidate model to explore our hypothesis, because this is the only model system known to increase cilia function at the present time. More specifically, this aim will examine the cellular mechanisms of primary cilia function in aneurysm in vitro and in vivo. Our previous studies also indicated that genomic instability and abnormal mitotic polarity contribute to aneurysm formation. In Aim 2, we therefore ask if improving polyploidy and mitotic polarity could reduce aneurysm formation in vivo. The findings from these studies will provide useful information on the role of cilia in the regulation of vascular function and will generate new knowledge toward the understanding of vascular aneurysm."
"9351157","Project Summary  RNA plays a diverse set of roles in biology. Localization of RNA in different regions of the cell establishes the developmental program of multicellular organisms and errors in this process have been implicated in neurological disorders. Long non-coding RNAs and microRNAs provide sophisticated regulatory functions that are still being elucidated. Cell-to-cell variations in RNA expression have been identified as a mechanism through which cancer cells become drug tolerant. Despite the profound influence of RNA, it remains a considerable challenge to monitor in living cells the expression dynamics and localization of multiple RNAs. Existing techniques have thus far suffered from substantial drawbacks, such as inefficient delivery, high background fluorescence, limited multiplexing, or require sequence modifications or labelling of the RNA being imaged.  This proposal describes an innovative strategy for multiplexed imaging of RNAs in live cells. This strategy employs genetically encoded RNA-based probes termed molecular fuses that undergo an intramolecular chain reaction upon binding to a target RNA that mimics the propagation of a flame along a fuse. These self-assembling systems will enable direct imaging of RNAs down to the single-copy level and visualization of RNA expression in heterogeneous cell populations. Key to this imaging strategy is a new approach to triggered self-assembly in which a domino-like chain reaction is initiated within a single molecule in response to an RNA binding event. This unimolecular self-assembly paradigm stands in stark contrast to the prevailing approach that relies on interactions between multiple short probes whose reaction kinetics are limited by diffusion in the cytoplasm.  The immediate benefits of this single-molecule self-assembly strategy are threefold. First, encoding the self- assembly program within a single RNA leads to an enhanced local concentration of interacting domains and dramatically increases reaction rates. Second, the high reaction kinetics and strong thermodynamics driving the intramolecular self-assembly reaction lead to high assembly yields. Third, programming of self-assembly within a single strand of RNA leads to triggered probes with a precisely defined number of fluorescent labeling sites for each target RNA enabling highly multiplexed imaging capabilities.  To realize this innovative live-cell RNA imaging platform, we will accomplish four principal aims:  (1) Construct RNA sensors that bind to target RNAs and output aptamers with different fluorescent ligands.  (2) Develop molecular fuse RNAs that undergo intramolecular chain reactions with RNAs in the cell.  (3) Implement multicolor molecular fuses with combinations of aptamers for multiplexed RNA imaging.  (4) Generate molecular fuses that activate dozens of aptamers for single-molecule RNA imaging.  The proposed research will enable us to visualize RNA expression and localization in a deeper and less perturbative fashion than has ever been possible before. It will also provide a new strategy for triggered nucleic acid self-assembly with profound implications for medicine, biotechnology, and nanotechnology."
"9360609","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  In the first 5-year period of our BRP we had two major objectives:  1) to determine whether we could improve motor function of the lower limbs by neuromodulating the spinal lumbosacral circuitry with epidural stimulation and 2) to begin to develop and improve the technologies associated with electrode arrays and chronic implantable stimulation devices to maximize the neuromodulatory potential.  These new technologies have the potential to fine tune the epidural stimulation parameters, to help in understanding some of the underlying mechanisms of epidural stimulation., to examine synergistic effects of epidural stimulation, pharmacological modulation, and examine activity-dependent interventions that might affect the level of recovery of motor function after complete paralysis.  We have demonstrated that an adult rat with a complete, mid-thoracic spinal cord transection can regain full weight-bearing stepping over a range of speeds, loads, and even directions when the spinal cord is stimulated tonically to increase the excitability of the lumbosacral locomotor circuitry.  Furthermore, we learned that load-bearing sensory information can serve as the controller of these complex motor tasks and that the performance of these tasks can be improved even further with combinations of epidural stimulation, pharmacological, and motor training interventions.  We have shown that four humans with a motor complete spinal injury have regained independent standing, assisted stepping, and even a significant level of voluntary control of the lower limbs in the presence of epidural stimulation, with one subject now even having some volitional control without stimulation.  Improvement in bladder control, blood pressure, temperature regulation, and even sexual function has been realized.  Thus, our present challenge is to develop the capability to selectively activate combinations of neural networks that can enable standing, and probably stepping, by improving the technologies needed to make this intervention available in the clinic and in the home of individuals with complete motor paralysis using a chronic epidural electrode implant.  Specifically, we will further improve the electrode array stimulation technology needed for fine-tune control in rats and humans and transform the present hardwired technology for rats to a wireless capability to stimulate and record evoked potentials along the brain-spinal cord-muscle axis in the rat.  To advance the clinical potential, we will continue to develop, refine and validate our machine-learning strategies which automatically optimize stimulation parameters for standing, stepping, and voluntary control.  We will develop an improved interface between the devices implanted in our present subjects and the control devices for defining the specific stimulation parameters needed for a given subject to perform a motor task in the clinic or at home."
"9313130","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Because intimate partner violence (IPV) and sexual assault (SA) are major public health concerns, primary prevention strategies at all levels of the social ecology are critical. To date, however, there are few community- level IPV and SA prevention efforts that have been developed, implemented, and rigorously evaluated. The proposed study will test the effectiveness of a novel, community-level strategy (i.e., GreenDot Community) for preventing both IPV and SA. A quasi-experimental methodology will be utilized such that two communities will receive no intervention, one community will receive community-based components of GreenDot (i.e., bystander trainings), and two communities will receive the community-based components in addition to capacity building for social marketing campaign and action events hypothesized to be the catalysts of change for collective efficacy and injunctive norms. To evaluate the impacts of the community-level interventions, baseline data will be collected through multiple methods during year one of the grant and post-intervention data will be collected during year four of the grant. Multiple methods of data collection will be utilized and include: random-digit dial survey of adults, a school-based survey of adolescents (in addition to utilization of YRBS data specific to schools in participating communities), observation of hot spots, concept mapping, and content coding of social media sites. Analyses will determine if the community-level intervention leads to reductions in community rates of IPV and SA, in addition to determining the key mediating variables of these outcomes (i.e., increase collective efficacy and shift injunctive norms to be intolerant of gender-based violence) as well as moderation variables (e.g., demographic variables and community readiness). Ultimately the proposed project will shed light on whether a novel community-level IPV and SV prevention effort reduces rates of IPV and SV in communities (as well as mediating and moderating effects of such potential outcomes); if proven effective, GreenDot community could be used by communities across the U.S. in efforts to reduce gender-based violence."
"9568131","Project Summary/Abstract Autoimmune diseases like type 1 diabetes arise through a breakdown in immune tolerance. We have now come to understand that immune tolerance consists of a multi-layered network that keeps such untoward responses in check. In this program project grant, three complementary teams will be working together to further unravel how these checkpoints operate to improve our understanding of autoimmunity and ultimately improve its treatment. This program project will have three highly collaborative and interactive projects headed by Drs. Mark Anderson (Project 1), Jeff Bluestone (Project 2) and John Kappler (Project 3) along with two scientific cores (Animal core and Molecular core). The major themes of the grant are: 1. The impact of central thymic tolerance on the T effector and Treg repertoire in T1D.. 2. Insulin as a critical self-antigen specificity for both T effectors and T regulatory cells in T1D. 3. Peptide specificity of Tregulatory cells in T1D 4. Using peptide binding characteristics of islet antigens to improve bioassays and tolerance methods. The long term objectives of this work is to improve our understanding of how T cell tolerance is controlled and the further refining the specificity of the autoreactive T cell response in type 1 diabetes. The investigators will be using state of the art tools in both animal models and in human subjects with type 1 diabetes. Results of these studies will help further refine our understanding of autoimmunity and help improve methods for its treatment and diagnosis."
"9442585","In this project we explore question of how the information replayed during the SPW-R is represented, how and in which sub-networks this information may get encoded during learning, and the molecular and network mechanisms that lead to storage of information at hippocampal synapses. Project 3.1 seeks to develop a method for artificially inducing a memory using new optogenetic methods that allow small groups of neurons to be excited in awake behaving animals. A measure of success will be if the artificial memory is replayed during a SPW-R. The value of such a system will be that it will provide a controlled system for studying the biophysics of memory encoding. Project 3.2 seeks to erase a behaviorally encoded memory. Recent work suggests that memory is stored synaptically by the abundant synaptic protein, CaMKII. This work was based on the ability of dominant negative CaMKII to erase conditioned place avoidance. We will test whether dominant negative CaMKII in CA3 or DG can erase the ability of hippocampal system to replay a memory during the SPW-R. Project 3.3 explores the question of how spatial information is represented in memory. One view is that spatial memory is represented as a continuous path. We will test the alternative hypothesis that memory can be represented selectively by reward sites. Project 3.4 takes advantage of recent advances in long-term optical recording of identified cells. This will allow us to make the first observation of the long-term stability of the stored sequence content replayed during SPW-Rs, as well as longitudinally identifying the network elements associated with this long-term replay, thereby providing important insight into the mechanisms of consolidation."
"9319032","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal seeks to establish a CDC Comprehensive Prevention Research Center focused on health- promotion aligned with the disease-prevention objectives of Healthy People 2020. The proposed Health Promotion Research Center at Dartmouth (HPRCD) will leverage the strengths and reach of primary care and community mental health centers in New Hampshire (NH) to conduct dissemination and implementation research on health promotion strategies with a focus on the population health goal of reducing obesity and smoking. Our goal is to measurably decrease cardiovascular risk factors in NH by partnering with primary care, mental health, state agencies, and community partners to identify needs, provide technical assistance, implement, and study evidence-based practices that systematically address two of the CDC's primary Winnable Battles: obesity and smoking. Aim 1 of the HPRCD is to support the implementation and outcome assessment of evidence- based, clinically feasible health promotion interventions for obesity and smoking cessation as an integrated component in primary care settings across NH. We will accomplish this first aim by establishing a Comprehensive CDC Prevention Research Center with six core initiatives: 1) a primary care health promotion implementation workgroup; 2) a mobile health promotion technology workgroup; 3) a health promotion early research career mentoring program; 4) Dartmouth COOP Primary Care Research Network projects; 5) DH Community Health Improvement Plan projects; and 6) collaboration with the regional ReThink Health Initiative. The Center will support and complement these efforts by providing administration and infrastructure support; engaging community partners and providing technical assistance; communicating and disseminating knowledge; providing training in health promotion and implementation research; and evaluation of program outcomes. Aim 2 of the HPRCD is to evaluate long-term weight reduction, smoking cessation, and program sustainability of a statewide demonstration of integrated health promotion in mental health care settings across NH. We will accomplish this second aim by conducting a dissemination and implementation research project that will build on a novel, statewide Centers for Medicare and Medicaid demonstration program implementing integrated health promotion interventions in New Hampshire's Community Mental Health System. The proposed study will evaluate: 1) long-term reduced cardiovascular risk after program completion for 1,500 obese or tobacco dependent adults with mental illness; 2) facilitators of long-term weight loss and smoking cessation: and 3) the long-term sustainability and costs of integrated health promotion programs."

"9345691","ABSTRACT Trauma is the 4th leading cause of morbidity and mortality after heart disease, malignancies, and lower respiratory illnesses in the United States. Blunt abdominal trauma (BAT) is commonly caused by vehicular accidents and falls. Uncontrolled bleeding is a major factor in early mortality after trauma, contributing to 30 to 40% of trauma-related deaths. Transcatheter arterial embolization (TAE) techniques play a significant role in the comprehensive modern treatment of traumatic vascular injuries to solid organs and extremities. Current embolic agents have proven to be problematical with regard to non-resorbability or unpredictable resorption, catheter clogging, or cytotoxicity due to the presence of organic solvents. Thus, there is a need for a new multi- potent embolic agent formulated with biocompatible components that addresses these issues to more effectively manage hemorrhage in trauma patients. The long-term goal is to obtain a simple, safe, and more effective treatment method for traumatic hemorrhage control after BAT. EmboMedics is developing a resorbable hydrogel that will improve clinical practice by providing an embolotherapeutic solution that is well-suited to a trauma care setting, being easy to mix and inject, self- crosslinkable, resorbable, nontoxic, and travelling distally from the site of injection. Preliminary data show that the hydrogel has an adjustable gelation time and resorption rate, is non-cytotoxic to endothelial cells and capable of occluding arteries, which is promising for hemorrhage control. Compared with Gelfoam, a commonly used embolic agent for trauma, this hydrogel would obviate the need for manual cutting to size prior to use. Compared to liquid local hemostatic agents such as N-butyl cyanoacrylate (super glue) and Onyx, the hydrogel is advantageous as it is easier to manipulate, resorbable, and non-cytotoxic. While not radiopaque, this novel hydrogel can be loaded with contrast to ensure visibility during embolization. Therefore, EmboMedics' hypothesis is that its novel hydrogel can serve as a naturally derived, nontoxic and completely biodegradable embolic agent that is more effective than existing agents for hemorrhage control. The objective of the proposed research is to validate the use of this novel hydrogel as an embolic agent for the control of internal bleeding that occurs with BAT. This project will evaluate the efficacy of the resorbable hydrogel in a porcine renal model (Specific Aim #1). This will be accomplished by creating a trauma model in the porcine kidney following an established procedure (Aim 1A). This will be used to test the efficacy of the hydrogel as compared to a non-resorbable embolic product, in hemorrhage control (Aim 1B). The long-term hemorrhage control and resorbability of the embolics will be evaluated over 10 weeks (Aim 1C). Necropsy and histopathological analysis of the tested kidneys will be performed to evaluate the extent of infarction, non-target embolization, hydrogel resorption, recanalization and tissue response (Aim 1D)."
"9440052","ABSTRACT Persistent developmental stuttering is a speech disorder that affects ~1% of the general population and is notoriously difficult to treat, often with life-long psychosocial and emotional consequences. In adults who stutter, approximately 50% report debilitating social anxiety disorder. While negative emotional reactions commonly result from persistent stuttering, theoretical models suggest that heightened levels of anxiety in children close to symptom onset may predict persistent stuttering. Whether anxiety and stuttering in young children share common underlying mechanisms remains unknown, but a cumulative body of research suggests that abnormal brain response to errors may drive both processes. Building from this research, we will test early anxiety and a neurophysiological index of error-processing, the ?error-related negativity? (ERN), as predictors of persistent stuttering at one-year follow-up in young children who stutter.  The proposed research considers the established relationship of ERN with anxiety, in the context of ?vicious cycle? model of stuttering that posits hypersensitivity to speech-errors drives stuttering disfluency. Extending this model, we suggest that early anxiety, together with age-related increases in stuttering awareness in young children, increase reactivity of the error-monitoring system, leading to persistent speech difficulties. To test this hypothesis, we will collect a detailed speech-language assessment, clinical measures of anxiety and ERN in thirty 3.5-6.0 year old preschoolers who stutter and twenty controls during an error-eliciting cognitive task, designed for young children. Ultimately, we expect that the successful completion of this research will position us to submit an R01 application to the National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders to establish clinically informed, mechanism-based biomarkers of the course of early stuttering that, ultimately, will guide the identification of children at highest risk for persistent symptoms and serve as targets for novel interventions to prevent chronic stuttering."
"9442951","GABAA receptors are Cl? permeable ion channels that mediate hyperpolarizing fast synaptic inhibition in the adult brain, while in immature developing neurons GABAA receptors depolarize and excite neurons. This shift in the signaling of GABAA receptors is due to the postnatal increase in the activity of KCC2, the neuron-specific K+/Cl- co-transporter. KCC2 is the major protein mechanism that allows neurons to pump Cl? out of the cell. In rodents KCC2 expression is evident at birth and increases substantially during the critical periods of early brain development between postnatal days 7 and 14. Deficits in KCC2 activity in humans lead to epilepsy, and are strongly implicated in chronic pain and developmental disorders such as Fragile X and Rett syndromes. Therefore, understanding the mechanisms by which neurons determine the proper postnatal increase of KCC2 activity and its maintenance in adults is clinically significant. KCC2 function is dynamically controlled by signals within neurons that can rapidly and reversibly modify its structure. Modification of KCC2's structure in one region increases its activity, while modification of KCC2's structure in another region decreases its activity. Our overarching hypothesis is that the correct balance between these opposing modifications contributes to the proper early postnatal development and adult maintenance of synaptic inhibition in the brain. To address this issue we have created two new genetic tools that can prevent the modification of KCC2's structure. Importantly, one of the genetic tools is the first of its kind to allow scientists to increase the function of KCC2, and so our proposal constitutes the first test of the theory which states that increasing KCC2 function can be utilized as a therapy. To date, no medications exist that can directly and rapidly increase the function of KCC2. The aims of our proposal are threefold: 1) demonstrate that preventing the modification of KCC2's structure is critical during early brain development; 2) examine the mechanisms by which disease causing factors influence the structure of KCC2 both in immature and more mature neurons; and 3) demonstrate that increasing the function of KCC2 can reduce the likelihood and severity of epileptic seizures.  Our study will provide new insights on how KCC2 structure and function is controlled under normal conditions and during disease states. This information may aid in the development of new and improved treatments to alleviate the burdens of a range of neurological disorders."
"9353655","PROJECT SUMMARY Conventional treatment for conductive hearing loss normally includes hearing aids or middle ear surgery, which restores movement or continuity of the ossicular chain. However, in cases where conventional surgery is unsuitable or unsuccessful, instead of relying on sound transduction via the normal path involving the ossicular chain and the oval window, round window (RW) stimulation has been attempted with some success. A current issue with RW stimulation is the large variability in efficacy of the device between patients. The effective coupling of the device to the RW membrane has a big influence on the transmission of motion from the device to the inner ear, and may therefore affect the success of an implant. Secondly, difference in the anatomy of inner ear structures may also affect the efficacy of a device by providing paths for acoustic leak along the cochlea. Therefore, understanding the variability and significance of middle ear anatomy (for device-RW coupling interface) and inner ear structures (to further fundamental scientific knowledge on RW stimulation) is essential in the effort to improve current devices. To achieve these goals, we have three main aims. We will comprehensively study the anatomy with cadaveric whole specimens as well as histological temporal bone slide sections in Aim 1. In Aim 2, we will develop and test an effective RW stimulation device that will safely and efficiently couple the device vibration to the inner-ear. This will be tested on cadaveric human temporal bones by measuring the stapes velocity and changes in inner ear pressures in response to the stimulation at the RW. Finally, in Aim 3, we will develop a computational model utilizing the calculated impedance obtained by our experiment measurements, to aid in understanding the mechanism of RW stimulation. This model will account for the impedances both in air conduction stimulation and RW stimulation. Overall, the proposed middle and inner ear research in fresh human cadaveric specimens will provide new and thorough understanding of the RW and develop a detailed impedance model of the human cochlea. The proposed research can lead to a safe and effective RW stimulation device that will improve hearing and quality of life for patients with conductive and mixed hearing loss."
"9563524","Aging is the major risk factor for Alzheimer?s disease (AD), leading to cellular and functional changes within the brain that culminate in dementia and cognitive decline. Lessening or reversing brain aging may delay Alzheimer?s disease onset or even protect against Alzheimer?s pathogenesis, having a large effect on quality of life and health burden imposed by AD. This proposal tests the hypothesis that young plasma reverses hippocampal decline in plasticity and learning/memory in the aged brain through regulation of transcriptional programs, including gene networks involving Alzheimer?s pathogenesis. TIMP2 is a key blood-borne factor enriched in young plasma that enhances hippocampal Activator-protein 1 (AP-1) and other plasticity markers, while reversing hippocampal cognitive decline in aged mice. Experiments will examine young plasma-mediated and TIMP2-mediated enhancement of AP-1, a transcriptional regulator of genes involved in hippocampal function, including MMPs that are intimately tied to amyloid-? metabolism. I will investigate the role of TIMP2 in mediating transcriptional changes in plasticity and Alzheimer?s-related genes in the aged hippocampus and the extent to which TIMP2 is a necessary factor for the beneficial effects conferred by young plasma. The mechanism by which TIMP2 improves hippocampal function, including its site of action, duration of its transcriptional control, and the effect of long-term increased TIMP2 activity on limiting cognitive decline in aged mice will be investigated.  The results may inform therapies directed at restoring TIMP2 function as a treatment for Alzheimer?s disease.  To fully characterize transcriptional changes induced by both young plasma and blood-borne TIMP2, Aim 1 will use next-generation sequencing methods (RNA-seq and ChIP-seq) in aged hippocampal tissue from mice treated systemically with young plasma, TIMP2, or control. ChIP-seq will be performed to identify all genes bound and regulated by AP-1 following treatment. Aim 2 assesses the necessity of TIMP2 for the cognitive improvements and transcriptional changes (identified in Aim 1) mediated by young plasma. Mice treated with young plasma will be compared to those receiving TIMP2-depleted (or KO) plasma or control. Aim 3 examines TIMP2?s site of action for improvements in aged hippocampal function (peripheral vs central) using a neutralization approach. The duration of TIMP2?s transcriptional regulation following treatment and the transcriptional and cognitive consequences of long-term peripheral TIMP2 expression using a viral-mediated approach will be pursued. Together, these aims critically assess the role of systemic TIMP2 in reversing hippocampal cognitive decline as a means to limit the impact of Alzheimer?s disease."
"9502128","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Reducing Duration of Untreated Psychosis (DUP) is a primary goal for improving long-term outcomes in young people with a first episode of psychosis (FEP). The standard of FEP care within the US focuses on targeted provider education1 regarding signs and symptoms of early psychosis to motivate patient referrals to FEP services, followed by initiation of services within largely clinic-based settings 2. Experience at the Early Diagnosis and Preventive Treatment (EDAPT) FEP specialty program at U.C. Davis in Sacramento has identified two important bottlenecks to reducing DUP, consistent with reports in the literature from other FEP clinics. These are 1) delays in the identification of psychotic symptoms by referral sources, and 2) delays or disruptions of patient engagement in specialty FEP care. Building upon a comprehensive and established referral network of 20 sites across the Sacramento area (schools/universities, ER/inpatient hospitals, outpatient mental health, primary care), we will address delays in patient identification and engagement using a two- phase, cluster randomized design. We will consecutively test the impact of two interventions to reduce DUP, defined in this RFA as time from first onset of psychotic symptoms to engagement in FEP specialty care. To address identification delays, we will examine the use of standard targeted provider education plus novel technology-enhanced screening compared to standard targeted provider education alone, testing the hypothesis that the education plus technology-enhanced screening will identify more patients, earlier in their illness. To address engagement delays, we will compare the use of a mobile community-based, telepsychiatry- enhanced engagement team to standard clinic-based procedures for intake, engagement and initiation of treatment, to test the hypothesis that the mobile approach facilitates earlier and more stable engagement, thereby reducing DUP. The proposed work will provide new specific evidence-based practices for reducing DUP and improving outcomes through specialty care of individuals with a first episode of psychosis."
"9565031","The long-term goal of this project is to study mechanisms of pituitary control of ovarian and bone function in aging women. Normal ovarian function is dependent on follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), a pituitary derived heterodimeric glycoprotein consisting of a ?-and a ?-subunit. Both the subunits are glycosylated with two N- linked sugar chains in each subunit. This fully glycosylated form is designated FSH24. Glycosylation plays a major role in secretion, serum half-life and biological actions of FSH. It is known that glycosylation of pituitary gonadotropins is also estrous/menstrual cycle- and age-specific. Biochemical and physiological studies in several species have identified unique hypo-glycosylated variants consisting of sugar chains only in the ? but either one or none on the ? subunit. These variants are known as hypo-glycosylated FSH glycoforms and designated as FSH21, FSH18 or FSH15. Most importantly, the ratio of hypo- to fully-glycosylated FSH forms is found age-dependent, with high levels of fully-glycosylated variant predominantly present in peri/post- menopausal women and may contribute to the aging-associated bone loss. However, the distinct in vivo biological functions of these FSH glycoform variants are unknown in normal and aging ovarian and bone physiology. The central hypothesis is that glycosylation on FSH is an age-related switch that changes target tissue specificity from ovary to bone. This hypothesis will be tested using genetically engineered mouse models in two specific Aims. In Aim 1, we will test ovarian development and function progressively with aging using Fshb null mice expressing individual glycosylated forms of FSH. This genetic strategy will allow us to test systematically the in vivo biological actions of each glycosylated FSH variant in ovarian physiology in the absence of endogenous mouse FSH. In Aim 2, first, we will use the FSH glycoform-expressing mice and test bone development as a function of aging. To unequivocally test the direct actions of FSH on bone, in one approach, we will engineer mice in which Fshr will be selectively deleted in osteoclasts by a Cre-lox genetic approach. In a second approach, we will develop a genetically engineered mouse line that permits creating temporal loss of FSH at desired times. Functional analyses with these genetically altered mouse models will identify distinct biological actions of FSH variants in vivo during ovarian aging and by extrapolation, in human ovarian senescence. These novel mouse models will also allow us to directly test whether aging-associated bone loss is dependent on FSH ligand or FSH receptor-mediated signaling in osteoclasts in the bone. Our studies may unravel a novel phenomenon of age-dependent N-glycosylation switch on a pituitary glycoprotein hormone that results in alterations in target tissue specificity (ovary versus bone) and may potentially lead to new therapeutic options for intervention of bone loss in aging women."
"9393446","ABSTRACT Our nation?s veterans are at a high risk for developing Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) with rates of mortality and morbidity that are extremely high. CKD progressing to End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) is a disabling condition resulting in patients requiring hemodialysis thrice weekly to maintain life. Functional independence on hemodialysis requires a reliable and well-functioning vascular access to connect to the dialysis machine for treatments. Vascular access is crucial to the treatments necessary for hemodialysis patients. Due to their reliability, longevity, and lower complication rates, autogenous arteriovenous fistulas ? surgically created connections between arteries and veins ? have become increasingly prominent over other forms of vascular access. However, the uncertainty associated with fistula maturation has caused undue cost, risk, and stress to patients already undergoing significant medical procedures. Furthermore, fistula dysfunction in the dialysis unit impedes stable effective dialysis, creates undue psychological stress in patients, in addition to increasing the cost of medical care. Currently no system exists to directly and noninvasively measure the underlying causes of vascular remodeling during fistula maturation, or provides comprehensive diagnosis of fistula dysfunction at the bedside. We propose to build and clinically validate an ultrasound diagnostic platform ? referred to as the Point of Care Elastographic Sono-Angiography (eSA) that has unprecedented temporal and spatial resolution to identify vessel wall edges and measure vessel size, elastic properties, and blood-wall shear rate during the cardiac cycles, and 3D mapping of the vascular anatomy at the point of care. After validating this tool both in vitro (through phantom studies on simple and realistic fistula geometries) and in vivo (clinical study conducted on hemodialysis patients pre- and post-fistula creation), we plan to release the software as an open platform tool for researchers. This software tool will be useful for pre-operative planning and post-operative assessment to guide decisions for angioplasty and surgical revision. Given the ubiquity and noninvasive nature of ultrasound imaging and the broad open access with which we plan to release this tool, this proposal can radically accelerate safe and effective ultrasound diagnostic methods for fistula optimization. In addition, given the generalizability to other peripheral vascular systems (carotid, extremities) this system has the potential to optimize vascular diagnostics and thereby improve the functional capacity of veterans suffering from peripheral and cerebral arterial disease. By validating this technology in the dialysis fistula setting, this project will lay the foundation for further clinical research applied to expanded clinical indications in vascular medicine in the future."
"9566431","Stroke is a major public health problem in the United States. It is the fifth leading cause of death and a leading cause of serious disability in adults. There are an estimated 800,000 strokes in the United States each year, with more than 4.4 million stroke survivors. Twenty percent of stroke survivors require institutional care after 3 months and 15%-30% are permanently disabled. Recurrent events, which occur in 185,000 stroke survivors in the United States each year, are associated with higher mortality rates, greater levels of disability, and increased costs as compared with first strokes. Stroke in adults is strongly age dependent, and the rate of adverse outcomes and complications associated with stroke increases with advanced age. Because the United States population is aging, the population at risk for stroke and recurrent events will increase over the coming decades. Its high prevalence and associated deficits impose a large burden on patients, their families, and the healthcare system. Optimizing post-acute care and secondary prevention efforts for stroke survivors represents an important target to reduce the burden of recurrent stroke, particularly among the elderly. Racial- ethnic and regional disparities have been identified for stroke incidence, prevalence, and morality, but relatively little research has focused on potential disparities in the patterns of recurrent stroke events. The Patterns of Recurrent Stroke in the Elderly Study will use Medicare administrative data to achieve the following specific aims: 1) to determine rates of recurrent stroke in elderly Medicare beneficiaries hospitalized with ischemic stroke and assess disparities in recurrent rates by geographic and sociodemographic characteristics; and 2) to identify socioeconomic, healthcare access, lifestyle/comorbidity, and post-acute care factors that may contribute to variation in recurrent stroke events. Clinical practice, public policy, and reimbursement decisions are increasingly informed by data obtained from administrative datasets. The Patterns of Recurrent Stroke in the Elderly Study will be the largest contemporary investigation of recurrent stroke rates and patterns in the United States. Results from this project will identify geographic areas and subgroups that have distinctive health profiles that put them at high risk for recurrent stroke. Such information will inform care providers, insurers, public health agencies, and policy makers about communities that may derive the greatest benefit from targeted programs and community-based interventions."
"9338036","Abstract An effective bullying prevention program or strategy is one that incorporates evidence on protective factors at multiple levels including: healthy self-esteem among youth; positive student-teacher interactions; normative beliefs that sanction rather than endorse bullying; and a school climate based on fairness and trust (Guerra et al., 2011). Nationally, 20% of students have been bullied on school property (CDC, 2012). Research studies have demonstrated that bullying prevention implementation is mediated by teacher factors (e.g., self-efficacy, perceived topic relevance, job stress, experience); school factors (e.g., leadership structure); program factors (e.g., appropriate goals and teaching pedagogy) and student factors (e.g., behaviors) (Kealey et. al., 2000; Showers et al., 1987; Zhai et al., 2011). Although teachers are ?front line? providers in bullying prevention, the availability of teacher training and capacity building courses is ?woefully inadequate? (Smith, 2011). Teachers often do not have access to reliable resources to their anti-bullying efforts; and little guidance for how to implement effective strategies fit to their specific contexts and students (Domitrovich et al., 2008; Espelage & Swearer, 2008). The proposed Teen-created Online Tolerance and Anti-bullying Library (TOTAL) will offer teachers an innovative multimedia resource providing information about effective bullying prevention programs and best practices; as well as how to deliver prevention efforts employing active and meaningful youth engagement. In Year 1 we will complete development of a modular online resource that refocuses bullying prevention from negative deficient models to a positive youth development model inspired by Social and Emotional Learning principles.

"9548140","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Myopia (short-sightedness) results from a failure of emmetropization in which eyes grow too long for their optical power.  Myopia's association with sight-threatening complications and near-epidemic prevalence in several populations make it critical that effective treatments for slowing myopia progression be developed.  The chick eye has provided a very fruitful model, yielding evidence for local retinal control of eye growth, identifying multifocal (MF) optical manipulations that inhibit ocular elongation as potential myopia treatments, and providing initial insights into the mechanism underlying atropine's anti-myopia action.  The guinea pig, a mammalian model with a fibrous sclera more like human sclera, has yielded valuable translational data.  Our proposal relied on recent findings from many labs, including our own, to develop a multi-pronged approach to myopia control.  It exploits novel tools and advanced technologies to pursue 4 aims:  (1) We will use our novel optical imaging (cone) devices and MF spectacle lenses combined with neurotoxins to further investigate the mechanisms underlying MF lens  effects on eye growth, and the variables influencing treatment efficacy.  (2) We will investigate the anti-myopia actions of atropine, to better understand the roles of retinal and nonretinal mechanisms and to determine effective dosing regimens.  (3) We will investigate whether treatment efficacy can be improved by combining MF lenses designed to slow myopic growth with either or both atropine and very bright light, which is also known to slow myopia progression.  Experiments under Aim 3 will make use of results from earlier experiments (Aims 1 & 2).  We will apply molecular biology tools to study retinal/retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) signal pathways.  RPE gene expression signatures of myopic and hyperopic growth developed in the last grant period will be exploited to obtain insights into nature of treatment mechanisms and interactions.  (4) We will test MF contact lenses in guinea  pig to translate our recent related MF spectacle lens studies and look for parallels with chick retinal and RPE  molecular signatures that may be applied to understand ocular growth signals."
"9396272","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The gastric mucosa of the stomach is continually exposed to a variety of stress factors which can cause local epithelial damage, and potentially lead to larger mucosal lesions, known as peptic ulcers. Peptic ulcer disease (PUD) remains an important issue in healthcare as it occurs in 10-15% of the population and is common in the elderly. New research suggests that proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), the most widely used treatment regimens for PUD, may increase the risk of dementia and chronic kidney disease. As PUD is prevalent in the elderly, the increased risk of dementia with the use of PPIs is alarming. These latest findings highlight the need for a better understanding of the mechanisms of gastric repair that may lead to new therapeutic treatments and help to minimize ulcer incidence or accelerate the repair process. Gastric restitution is the initial event during repair in which damaged cells are expelled away from the site of injury and neighboring viable cells act to cover the denuded mucosa without proliferation. One important factor that has been shown to affect gastric epithelial restitution is the mucus secreted peptide, trefoil factor 2 (TFF2). Work from our lab has shown that TFF2 is necessary for restitution in vivo and requires the sodium hydrogen exchanger isoform 2 (NHE2) for proper repair following damage. Outside of the gastrointestinal tract, evidence points to the potential of TFF2 acting through the TFF receptor CXCR4 which transactivates EGFR. EGFR is known to activate the Erk signaling pathway which has been implicated in NHE2 activation and restitution. Additionally, intracellular calcium (Ca2+) has been shown to be a necessary component within repair. While TFF is known to stimulate protein kinase C (PKC) and Ca2+ mobilization and Ca2+ is known to modulate repair, there is no direct evidence that Ca2+ mobilization is required for TFF2 mediated repair. Due to the complexities of in vivo work and the inconsistences of in vitro immortalized cell lines, the signaling cascade behind TFF2-mediated restitution has yet to be confirmed. Preliminary data have shown that damaged gastric organoids exhibit TFF2-dependent repair, showing key parallels to in vivo findings. This proposal seeks to utilize the novel in vitro gastric organoid system, which has been previously shown to recapitulate native tissue, in order to elucidate the mechanism behind TFF2-driven repair. Based upon preliminary data and previous studies, I hypothesize that TFF2 is the initiating factor which stimulates downstream signaling cascades to promote restitution following repair. To test this hypothesis, I will pursue two specific aims: (1) to determine the role of TFF2/CXCR4 driven EGFR signaling on NHE2 activation and gastric restitution; and (2) to identify the role of PKC signaling and intracellular Ca2+ in TFF2-driven repair. By examining EGFR- and Ca2+-mediated restitution, we have the potential to draw together two separate fields and bring together a number of findings that have previously existed in isolation. The data and experiments presented herein are the logical starting place to address ulcer healing for conditions such as PUD and may provide new therapeutic clinically relevant approaches."

"9362043","SUMMARY  It has been shown that patients carrying HIV-1 accumulate damage to cells and tissues that are not directly infected by the virus itself (e.g. neurons). Importantly, these include changes known as HIV- Associated Neurodegenerative Disorder (HAND) leading to the loss of neuronal functions.  HAND is an outstanding problem in the clinical management of HIV-1 patients, because suppression of infectious virus by c-ART does not completely block neurodegenerative changes. Neuropsychological studies disclose cognitive alteration (such as loss of Spatial and Declarative Memory) in a substantial proportion of HIV-1 infected patients, and analysis of post-mortem brain tissues isolated from HIV-1 patients treated with c- ART show signs of neurodegeneration.  In the absence of HIV-1 infection of neurons, a number of mechanisms have been proposed for HAND, including indirect inflammatory effects in the CNS and direct effects of viral proteins (e.g. Tat) shed from activated HIV-1-infected cells. The fact that these viral proteins enter the neurons through several pathways suggest the presence of many competing mechanisms that can contribute to HAND, each of which has its advocates. Their relative contributions to clinical disease in vivo remain to be sorted out, and this is an outstanding problem in HIV research.  Studies from other neurodegenerative diseases described the cAMP responsive-element binding (CREB)-1 protein as a Key Regulator of the Memory. These studies also showed that loss of CREB protein expression and phosphorylation contributes to the development of neurocognitive impairments such as Spatial and Declarative Memory Alteration.  Recently, we have obtained data showing a clear-cut effect of HIV-1 Tat on CREB protein phosphorylation and function in vitro (primary human and mouse neurons and in the neuronal cell line, SH-SY5Y) and in vivo (in mice injected with Tat then treated with Rolipram [activator of CREB]) (see BACKGROUND AND PRELIMINARY RESULTS). This finding is exciting for two reasons:  (1) A correlation between CREB protein and neurodegeneration has been well-established in the literature,  suggesting that this may be a significant contributory mechanism in HAND; and  (2) Agents are available which can specifically restore CREB protein levels and function, offering an  opportunity to test directly the contribution of this mechanism in vivo in mice.  Our hypothesis is that Tat contributes to neurodegeneration via reduction of mitochondrial function, mediated by a decrease in CREB protein activity.  We propose to test this hypothesis in tissue culture cells and in vivo in mice, and verify the intermediate role of CREB protein using the specific CREB activator: Rolipram.  Therefore, in this revised application, we asked more specific and focus questions that will allow us to perform additional in vitro and in vivo studies to determine the exact mechanisms used by Tat leading to the loss of Memory by focusing mainly on the Tat-CREB function and to restore this lost declarative memory and learning.  Completion of these studies will determine for the first time involvement of HIV-1 Tat in cognitive disorders such as, Learning Deficit and Spatial & Declarative Memory Impairment that is commonly observed in HIV- 1 patients as well as in aged persons. Using an Intervention (Rolipram) approach to prevent CREB loss of functions will help establishing a new therapeutic strategy (high throughput screening) to mitigate cognitive impairments associated with HIV-1 infection in HIV/AIDS patients. (Since the relation between Tat and BDNF was amply studied, we will propose BDNF experiments to validate our hypothesis only). !"
"9449680","ABSTRACT: The dog is an ideal large animal model for diagnostic and therapeutic studies and can be used to translate successes to human patients while providing compassionate care to animals and advancing the field of veterinary medicine. Pet dogs share their environment, and oftentimes their diet, with their owners. Dogs and humans develop sporadic benign and malignant brain tumors at about the same rate and with similar histopathology. Dogs are often euthanized due to the cost of care. Thus, the spontaneously occurring canine brain tumor represents an ideal opportunity to improve the lives of people as well as pets through comparative oncology and genomics and the ?One Medicine? approach to research and direct clinical application. We propose a multi-institutional consortium to test an innovative combinatorial immunotherapeutic approach in dogs that spontaneously and sporadically develop malignant glial brain tumors that resemble in most important aspects, high-grade malignant gliomas in humans. Our approach will inject a clinical grade oncolytic herpes simplex virus (HSV) M032 that expresses human interleukin-12 (IL-12) into the resected tumor bed. Dog lymphocytes fully respond to human IL-12 [1] and oncolytic HSV infect and kill canine (as well as mouse, non-human primate, human) tumor cells, creating a potent local inflammatory response and an antigen-rich tumor cell debris field. Therefore, we would anticipate that this virally-based immunotherapeutic approach would likely be as effective in dogs with brain tumors as in humans with brain tumors. We will conduct longitudinal safety, survival and correlative biology evaluations as a means of assessing the dog as an appropriate and informative model for design and implementation of clinical studies in humans with high-grade malignant brain tumors. To extend these findings, we propose, in subsequent studies, to combine the HSV immunotherapy approach with molecules that block the action of innate checkpoint inhibitor(s). These studies are designed to address key issues of safety and efficacy of combinatorial immunotherapy in the dog that can be translated to humans with malignant gliomas. Malignant gliomas are the most common primary brain tumors in humans, accounting for 30% of all primary central nervous system (CNS) tumors in adults. [2] With few major advances in decades, there has been no significant reduction in mortality and only a modest improvement in median survival. Recently, objective responses and long-term survivals have been observed in human glioma patients who have received oncolytic virotherapy and a Phase I trial is currently underway at UAB in patients using M032 alone. New approaches to utilize checkpoint inhibitors promises improved efficacy, but the ability to develop more effective combinatorial approaches has been slow, in large part due to lack of a faithful model of spontaneous glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) in immunocompetent hosts. Thus, the spontaneously occurring canine brain tumor represents an ideal opportunity to improve the lives of people and pets through comparative oncology and genomics using the ?One Medicine? approach to research and direct clinical application."
"9336170","The lifetime prevalence of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is approximately 30% among Vietnam Veterans and 11-17% among Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans. PTSD is associated with enormous health care costs, increased suicidality, depression, poorer quality of life and functioning, physical health, and increased substance use. Prolonged exposure (PE) is an efficacious treatment for Veterans with PTSD that decreases avoidance of feared, but safe, cues. Despite PE being one of the best available treatments for PTSD, 25 to 45% of PTSD patients still meet diagnostic criteria following treatment. High rates of comorbid disorders, such as insomnia, may interfere with the efficacy of PE and limit long-term rehabilitation outcomes.  Among Veterans with PTSD, sleep disturbances are nearly universal with 70 - 87% reporting comorbid insomnia. Untreated insomnia can persist for years, is independently associated with impaired health-related quality of life, does not resolve following PTSD treatment, and can exacerbate daytime PTSD symptoms. Importantly, insomnia may interfere with the mechanisms of PE through safety learning, habituation to feared stimuli, emotional coping, emotional processing, and cognitive abilities necessary for successful treatment. Despite this, insomnia is not a primary intervention for Veterans with PTSD. Given these factors, it is critical to evaluate whether treating insomnia prior to PTSD will improve PTSD symptoms and quality of life outcomes.  Cognitive behavioral treatment for insomnia (CBT-I) is the first line treatment of chronic and severe insomnia, which produces lasting improvements in sleep. By using CBT-I prior to, and integrated with, PE offers several novel advantages that will: 1) increase client-centered treatment by addressing the number one subjective complaint among Veterans with PTSD; 2) enhance PTSD outcomes and non-response rates by addressing insomnia-related factors that interfere with PTSD treatment; 3) act as a stepping stone and help to engage patients who are not initially willing to engage in trauma-focused PE; 4) increase rehabilitation outcomes by addressing the two leading disorders that independently affect quality of life for Veterans; 5) allow patients to address both symptoms of insomnia and PTSD within a shortened timeframe; 6) increase continuity by allowing patients to work with a single provider; and 7) decrease the risk of attrition between referral clinics and waitlists. To date, no studies have capitalized on available evidence-based CBT-I prior to PE to improve insomnia, PTSD, and quality of life outcomes.  The proposed CDA-2 randomized control trial will evaluate the efficacy of integrating evidence based CBT-I into PE (CBTI-PE) compared to a non-active sleep component plus PE (hygiene-PE) to optimize PTSD, sleep, and quality of life outcomes in 90 Veterans. Our research has three overarching aims: Aim1 (primary outcome): Investigate the efficacy of CBTI-PE compared to hygiene-PE on PTSD symptoms among Veterans with comorbid PTSD and insomnia. Aim 2 (secondary outcomes): Examine the effects CBTI-PE on sleep and quality of life outcomes, when compared to a control group, in male and female Veterans with comorbid PTSD and insomnia. Aim 3 (Mediation): Investigate whether sleep mediates the relationship between treatment group and the decreases in PTSD symptoms.  Approaching insomnia as an independent target integrated with PE represents a logical, innovative, and empirically-informed method for augmenting existing treatments and optimizing outcomes consistent with the 2014-2020 VHA Strategic Plan. Findings from the proposed study will directly inform clinical practice by investigating whether treating insomnia together with PTSD increases the recovery from insomnia, PTSD, and quality of life outcomes. This translational program of research will help vulnerable Veteran populations achieve optimal and enduring recovery outcomes as well as lay the groundwork for future studies to further investigate the mechanisms between insomnia and PTSD treatment outcomes and other comorbid disorders."
"9422898","Project Summary and Relevance Many men diagnosed with prostate cancer will not die of it even without any intervention, enhancing the possibility of overtreatment. How urologists organize themselves is strongly linked to the nature and extent of treatment for localized prostate cancer. Those practicing in large urology groups, particularly urologists with an ownership stake in radiation facilities, more commonly treat men with prostate cancer who are unlikely to benefit (i.e., overtreatment). Conversely, urologists in multispecialty groups provide care at a lower cost, without compromising quality. Uncertainty surrounding the implications of evolving health policy is prompting a sea change in how physicians align themselves. Faced with increasing administrative burden to navigate reforms, urologists practicing alone or in small groups are aligning themselves with larger entities, including multispecialty groups and large urology groups. Because practice context is strongly tied to prostate cancer overtreatment and spending, policy induced realignment of urologists has significant public health implications. The goal of this national study is to understand the effects of policy on relationships between urologist practice organization and prostate cancer care (i.e., treatment, quality and payment). This grant, which uses national Medicare data, has the following three aims: 1) To determine the effect of changing practice organization on prostate cancer care; 2) To measure the effect of hospital ownership of urology practices on prostate cancer care; and, 3) To determine how policy impacts relationships between urologist practice organization and prostate cancer care. We plan to use interrupted time series and difference-in-difference methods to control for differences in baseline case-mix and temporal trends. Results from this study have real-world implications for patients, who are naturally interested in getting the best prostate cancer care at the lowest possible cost. Our findings will immediately inform policymakers on the extent to which the impact of policy is mediated by practice organization, particularly by those that have historically favored volume over value."
"9559932","Abstract  Alzheimer?s disease (AD) is a triple health threat ? with soaring prevalence, enormous costs and lack of effective treatment. However, efforts in drug discovery and repurposing for the treatment of AD have had limited success. The failure is largely attributed to the adoption of a reductionist model of ?one-drug-one-gene- one-disease?. As AD is a multi-facet complex disease, a new treatment approach is urgently needed to simultaneously target multiple pathological processes responsible for the onset and progress of AD, some of which are also common to other diseases that cause dementia. In this application, we will develop an innovative translational bioinformatics approach to addressing challenges in AD drug discovery. Our approach is based on a new paradigm of systems pharmacology, which focuses on defining multiple targets to a single drug or a drug combination, and studying the effect of the drug(s) on perturbing disease-causing networks. Over the last ten years, we have developed a novel structural systems pharmacology (SSP) platform that can predict genome-wide high-resolution protein-chemical interactions and correlate molecular interactions with phenotype responses. The SSP platform synergistically combines novel methods from machine learning, bioinformatics, biophysics, and systems biology. We have successfully applied the SSP platform to drug repurposing, polypharmacology, side effect prediction, precision medicine, and Genome-Wide Association Studies. Building on our successful proof-of-concept studies, and in close collaborations with experimental laboratories, we will develop, and rigorously test a novel SSP approach to AD drug repurposing and polypharmacology. Firstly, we will develop a multi-layered drug-gene-pathway-disease-side effect network model (MULAN) that links FDA-approved drugs with dementia and side effects through protein-chemical interactions, gene-disease associations, chemical-disease associations, and dementia-associated biological pathways through integrating multiple omics data. Secondly, we will improve and apply our proven successful SSP platform, which can accurately infer novel relations from sparse and noisy MULAN, to identify safe FDA- approved drugs that can be repurposed for AD treatment. Finally, we will experimentally test FDA-approved drugs identified for their binding activity of drug targets and anti-AD potency in cell and animal models. The successful completion of this project will provide an integrated computational modeling framework for AD drug repurposing and polypharmacology as well as identify novel targeted anti-AD therapeutics toward pre-clinical trials."
"9357380","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Heart disease is the leading cause of death in the United States, and as lifespans continue to extend, the incidence of cardiovascular deterioration and heart failure in humans has dramatically increased. With prolonged aging there is significant remodeling within the cellular microenvironment leading to pathological alterations of myocardial tissue structure such as fibrosis and hypertrophy. These alterations largely result from deposition of extracellular matrix (ECM) components that adversely affect the mechanical properties of the tissue and lead to decreased contractile performance. Studying age-related heart failure in genetically tractable models is critical in order to determine what genetic influences and cellular mechanisms result in the decline of cardiac performance with age. Drosophila melanogaster, commonly known as the fruit fly, has been used previously as a model organism for cardiac genetics due to the relative conservation of human genes; however, it is also an ideal model for studying age-induced cardiac decline due to its short life span. The multilayered design of the heart provides a simpler structure in which to study how any age-associated ECM remodeling alters mechanical coupling between layers via modified ECM-costamere-sarcomere mechanotransduction to adversely impact cardiomyocyte contraction. Preliminary data suggests a correlation between ECM remodeling and contraction through reduced diastolic diameter and increased arrhythmicity. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) analysis previously used for measuring passive myocardial stiffness in Drosophila has also identified differences in the stiffness and thickness of the ECM layer between the ventral muscle and underlying cardiomyocytes. From these data, I propose that age-related ECM remodeling, i.e. ECM composition and assembly changes, alters the adhesive cross talk between fly heart layers, leading to distinct genotype-specific cardiomyopathies. I will first [1] examine ECM compositional, structural, and mechanical changes between the ventral and cardiomyocyte muscle layers in Drosophila strains to assess the effect of ECM on age-associated diastolic decline. I then will [2] functionally assess the contribution of major cardiac ECM proteins in mediating cell-ECM adhesion between layers during aging. Using the Drosophila cardiac aging model I hope to gain a better understanding of how in vivo cell integrin-ECM cross-talk affects mechanoelectric coupling of layers within cardiac tissue."
"9418969","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The Ponce Health Sciences University (PHSU) and the Moffitt Cancer Center (MCC) have forged a strong working relationship founded on seamless communication with mutual support and benefits. With Partnership resources and significant commitment from both institutions, we have established joint programs enhancing basic and clinical research, enriching cancer outreach, expanding cancer education, and creating a unique Hispanic/Latino (H/L) Biobank, leading to the development of a robust network and infrastructure necessary for a sustained long-term collaboration to improve cancer outcomes in the H/L population. The U54 Partnership?s immediate impact includes the identification of new mutations in breast and lung cancer in H/L patients, recruitment of new faculty essential for sustainability and growth, and 84 community outreach educational activities for H/Ls in Florida (FL) and Puerto Rico (PR). The development of the Puerto Rico Biobank (PRBB) and the training of clinical researchers, with 25 clinical intervention trials activated in Ponce, demonstrate the broad impact realized through the Partnership. Furthermore the Partnership had a critical role in the ACGME re-accreditation of the Hematology/Oncology Fellowship in PR, in the establishment of two stem cell transplant programs in PR by fellows trained in the MCC Bone Marrow Transplant unit, and in the establishment of an ACGME-accredited surgical residency in Ponce with surgical oncology rotations at MCC. The short-term metrics of the first 4 years of the U54 Partnership grant include 48 student participants, 35 peer-reviewed manuscripts published, and 29 grants funded out of a total of 64 submitted.  Our vision for the U54 PACHE renewal is to further grow and engage faculty and students in cancer precision medicine research that directly impacts the H/L populations in FL and PR. The Partnership has the requisite components to fully execute precision medicine in an underserved population?a biobank, quantitative science core (QSC) to analyze data, culturally sensitive outreach materials, expertise in the latest technologies, and a robust research portfolio. The four specific aims for the U54 Partnership renewal are the following. Aim 1: To increase the number of researchers at PHSU focused on basic/translational research in cancer and to augment the number of researchers in cancer health disparities at MCC. This is facilitated with joint projects in ovarian and breast cancer. Aim 2: To further develop outreach programs and research efforts in the H/L communities at both PHSU and MCC. An epidemiological project will examine the impact of receipt of MC1R genotypes on personal sun protection behaviors. Aim 3: To increase support for basic, translational and clinical research in the H/L population by establishing the QSC and further developing the PRBB. The MCC Total Cancer Care protocol will be developed in Ponce hospitals and leveraged by the PRBB to facilitate tissue collection. Aim 4: To provide comprehensive and structured student research education at both PHSU and MCC to facilitate the expansion and success of cancer researchers and clinicians in the H/L population."
"9451080","Project Summary During behavior, the oculomotor system is tasked with selecting objects from an ever-changing visual field and guiding eye movements to these locations. The attentional priority given to sensory targets during selection can be strongly influenced by external stimulus properties (?bottom-up?) or internal goals based on previous experience (?top-down?). Although these exogenous and endogenous drivers of selection are known to operate across partially overlapping time scales, how neural circuits mechanistically support top-down and bottom-up processing has been difficult to disentangle. This is because the neural circuits for spatial attention and selection are distributed across the frontal and parietal cortices and operate across multiple spatial scales spanning the activity of individual neurons and neuronal populations. In this Targeted Brain Circuit R01 Project proposal, an experimental group (Pesaran/NYU) and a theory group (Shanechi/USC) will use cutting-edge techniques developed under the NIH BRAIN Initiative support to validate predictive models of neuronal dynamics and test hypotheses about how frontal-parietal cortices perform attentional selection. A behavioral task that dissociates bottom up and top-down processing will let us define bottom-up and top-down target states. We will then build predictive models of neuronal dynamics within and between frontal and parietal cortex and empirically validate the models by stimulating neural activity to achieve the desired neural state. Aim 1 validates predictive models of local circuit dynamics. We will stimulate within PFC to achieve target states in PFC. Aim 2 validates predictive models of long-range circuit dynamics. We will stimulate sites in PPC that functionally connect to PFC in order to achieve target states in PFC. Aim 3 validates predictive models of distributed circuit dynamics. We will simultaneously stimulate both PFC and PPC to achieve the target states. In each case, successfully directing activity toward the target state will indicate the model is valid. If the target state reflects a causal role in attention, as opposed to correlating with attentional processes, we predict that behavioral choices will be biased. This proposal tackles several of the major topic areas of the BRAIN 2025 report. We will identify fundamental principles about circuit dynamics and functional connectivity for understanding the biological basis of mental processes through development of new theoretical and data analysis tools (Topic 5). We will produce a dynamic picture of the functioning brain by developing and applying improved methods for large-scale monitoring of neural activity (Topic 3). We will demonstrate causality by linking brain activity to behavior with precise interventional tools that change neural circuit dynamics (Topic 4). Recent years have seen dramatic advances in our ability to experimentally interface with the primate brain with increasing precision scale. A fruitful interplay between multiscale experiments and predictive modeling that we propose will let us test hypotheses about how flexible behaviors are controlled by large-scale neural circuits."
"9348600","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Venous thromboembolism (VTE) remains a frequent, but preventable complication for hospitalized patients that can lead to significant morbidity and mortality. It has been estimated that more than 900,000 VTE cases occur in the US every year. A range of VTE prevention interventions have been evaluated, such as electronic reminders and clinical decision support (CDS) for VTE risk assessment. Health information (IT) may provide an opportunity for improving the prevention and management of VTE. However, studies of electronic alerts based on computerized VTE risk assessment have produced limited benefits. These studies have been restricted to high-risk patients, have focused on prophylaxis (i.e. VTE prevention) with little or no consideration for VTE diagnosis and treatment (i.e. VTE management), and have not addressed sociotechnical challenges related to CDS design identified in numerous reports. We propose to use a sociotechnical systems approach to the design of health IT specifically for preventing and managing VTE; this approach can address the range of sociotechnical system issues that have limited the effectiveness of health IT for VTE. Using the SEIPS model and the human factors multi-level system model, we will develop a deep understanding of the cognitive and team work involved in VTE prevention and management, and then use the outputs of this analysis to define sociotechnical design requirements for a CDS that supports cognitive and team work for preventing and managing VTE. Our specific aims are: (1) to evaluate the cognitive and team work involved in VTE prevention and management; and (2) to develop design requirements for a CDS that supports cognitive and team work for preventing and managing VTE. The study will be conducted in four hospitals of an integrated healthcare system. Methods for analyzing cognitive and team work will be diverse (i.e. observation, interview, focus group and survey) (Aim 1) and will produce a range of outputs (e.g., decision ladders, process map, information flow diagram) that will be used to define the CDS design requirements (Aim 2). Using a collaborative process between the human factors engineers and the physicians on the research team, we will develop preliminary design requirements that will be embedded in CDS mock-ups; the CDS mock-ups will then be evaluated through scenario-based usability evaluation and group debriefings. The results of this analysis will help to define additional questions to address in the data collection for Aim 1. When all Aim 1 data have been collected and analyzed, we will finalize the CDS design requirements (Aim 2). This research focuses on VTE, but the broader objective is to develop an approach to design health IT applications for healthcare quality and safety problems that can benefit from improved integration of guidelines in clinical workflows. This study is significant and innovative because we are (a) addressing a common, but preventable complication, i.e. VTE; (b) using a sociotechnical systems approach and human factors principles and methods to design health IT; and (c) involving a highly experienced multidisciplinary team of human factors engineers and physicians."
"9446227","Project Summary ? Project 2 Melanoma, the most aggressive form of skin cancer, is characterized by a very high rate of somatic mutations. Approximately 50% of cutaneous melanomas have a mutation that affects the V600 residue in Braf. The activity of the mutant form of the protein (BRAFV600) is markedly increased and results in constitutive activation of the RAS-RAF-MAPK signaling pathway. This information has rapidly translated into clinical benefit, as five targeted therapy regimens have been approved for the treatment of metastatic melanoma patients with a BrafV600 mutation. While these agents have very high clinical response rates, unfortunately the majority of patients develop resistance within 2 years. Further, these targeted therapies cannot be used in patients who do not have a BrafV600 mutation. Thus, there remain unmet clinical needs to identify strategies to prevent resistance to approved targeted therapies in metastatic melanoma patients with an activating BrafV600 mutation, and new targeted therapy approaches for patients without a BrafV600 mutation (BRAF Wild-Type). While many studies are ongoing to evaluate the therapeutic potential of other kinase inhibitors, there is growing evidence to support the rationale for the testing of agents that target the apoptotic machinery. In contrast to many other cancers, cutaneous melanomas have a low rate (~20%) of mutations in Tp53. Additional studies have shown anti-apoptotic members of the BCL2 family of proteins can promote resistance to targeted therapies against the RAS-RAF-MAPK pathway, and that pro-apoptotic proteins (i.e., BIM) are critical to their effectiveness. Based on promising results in a limited number of preclinical models, clinical trials targeting the apoptotic machinery in combination with RAS-RAF-MAPK pathway inhibitors are ongoing in metastatic melanoma patients. However, currently there are no biomarkers to optimize patient selection for these strategies, nor understanding of resistance mechanisms to them. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that specific molecular features will predict sensitivity and resistance to combinatorial strategies utilizing pro- apoptotic agents and MAPK pathway targeted therapies. In order to test this hypothesis we will evaluate pro-apoptotic agents in combination with MAPK pathway inhibitors in molecularly characterized melanoma PDX models, which accurately replicate the molecular features and heterogeneity of this disease. In AIM 1 we will evaluate the efficacy and molecular effects of navitoclax, a BH3 mimetic that inhibits BCL2, alone and in combination with dabrafenib (BRAFi) and trametinib (MEKi) in melanoma PDX with a BrafV600 mutation. These experiments mirror an ongoing randomized phase II of these agents in metastatic melanoma patients, and the results of that trial will be used to clinically validate markers associated with resistance in the PDX. In AIM 2 we will evaluate the efficacy of the MDM2 inhibitor AMG232, alone and in combination with trametinib. Testing will be performed in BRAF WT melanomas with wild-type Tp53, including a subset with MDM2 amplification.

TACT2M is a companion study to TACT2 and will be integrated into the clinical trial platform of TACT2, which will enroll 1200 post-MI patients with diabetes who are at least 50 years old and have a creatinine of 2.0 mg/dL or less. TACT2, a replication study of TACT (referred to as TACT1), will be a 2X2 factorial trial, randomizing patients to 4 groups, defined by both active vs placebo infusions and active vs placebo oral multivitamins and multiminerals (OMVM). NCCIH has funded the UG3 1-year Planning Phase of TACT2. The co-primary endpoints of TACT2M are: 1] the change in blood lead level from baseline to infusion 40 or 1 year, whichever is first, and 2] the change in urine cadmium controlled for creatinine (Cd mcg/ gram creatinine) from baseline to infusion 40 or 1 year, whichever is first. TACT2M has 3 Specific Aims: 1] Compare the change in metal internal dose (blood lead and urine cadmium) in TACT2 participants, from baseline to infusion 40 or 1 year in the active infusion arm; 2] Evaluate whether higher baseline metal internal dose (blood lead and urine cadmium) and the extent of depletion of those stores identifies patients more likely to show benefit from chelation; 3] Collect a biorepository of specimens to support future mechanistic work. Samples of whole blood and urine will be stored at -80ºC in a secured biorepository to ensure their availability for the evaluation of future hypotheses that will be guided by the results of the trial. Moreover, TACT2M represents a unique opportunity to assess the following Exploratory Aims: a] whether post- infusion urine measurements, alone and in comparison to the corresponding pre-infusion measurements, have clinical significance; b] whether OMVM interact with edetate disodium-mediated metal excretion; and c] whether the suite of additional toxic and essential metals measured in blood and urine by the ICPMS analytic technique used by the metals lab, many of which are not chelated by edetate disodium, have clinical significance in preliminary testing. In summary, TACT2M will assess whether metal chelation is a possible mechanism for improved clinical outcomes in post-MI diabetic patients receiving edetate disodium chelation. The integration of TACT2M into the existing TACT2 study is an efficient method to inform the treatment of patients with a history of MI and diabetes."
"9565801","Project Summary Congenital heart defect (CHD) occurs in nearly 1 of 1000 live births, and approximately one third involves malformations of the cardiac outflow tract (OFT). Double outlet right ventricle (DORV) and overriding aorta (AO) are anomalies resulting from OFT misalignment. Currently the etiology of CHDs associated with OFT misalignment is largely unknown and the cellular, genetic, molecular basis of OFT development has remained elusive. Osr1 encodes a zinc finger protein and is strongly expressed in the dorsal mesocardium during early heart development. We found that precursor cells expressing Osr1 contributed to the pulmonary trunk and deletion of Osr1 caused DORV or OA. The Osr1 null mouse embryos had OFT rotation problem and had abnormal patterning of the SHF precursor cells in the dorsal mesocardium, which might result from proliferation defects in SHF. Interestingly, we and others reported that reduction of Pten, a well-established negative proliferation regulator, could rescue SHF proliferation defects, implying an inhibition role of Pten in modulating Osr1 regulated-SHF proliferation. We further identified potential Osr1 direct targets: Cdk6 and CycD2 involving cell cycle regulators, and Hh-signaling modulator Smo. The latter suggested an interaction between Osr1 and Hh-signaling, which is further supported by the finding that double compound heterozygous mutation of Osr1 and Smo caused a high penetration of DORV. Overall, these results strongly suggested a genetic regulatory of Osr1, Hh-signaling and cell cycle genes in SHF for OFT development. We hypothesize: Balanced by Pten inhibition, Osr1 modulates proliferation in SHF during OFT development by transcriptional regulation of proliferation related genes and Hh-signaling. To test this hypothesis, we propose the following three aims: (1) to determine how Osr1 modulates SHF cell proliferation for proper OFT alignment; (2) to investigate if and how Osr1 functions upstream of Hh-signaling in regulating OFT development; (3) to determine that Osr1 regulation on SHF proliferation and DORV is balanced by Pten inhibition. This work will uncover new candidate genes and mechanisms underlying common forms of CHDs."
"9350466","Abstract: Ions and membrane phospholipids can undergo dynamic transbilayer movement. While membrane ion transport mediated by ion channels and pumps is well appreciated in health and disease, the molecular mechanism, cellular function, physiological and pathological importance of membrane phospholipid transport are still poorly understood. Recently, I and others discovered that the newly discovered TMEM16 membrane protein family includes both ion channels and lipid scramblases. These findings open up unique opportunities to tackle the poorly understood lipid transport phenomenon. I propose herein a novel phospholipid-mediated cell signaling paradigm that is distinct from the canonical lipid signaling mechanism. In this paradigm, phospholipids, instead of being enzymatically metabolized, undergo dynamic transbilayer redistribution. This rapid transbilayer lipid transport mediated by TMEM16F lipid scramblase can spatiotemporally change the local/global lipid composition, and subsequently alter the membrane association of various signaling proteins and their downstream signaling cascades. I will test this new signaling paradigm by genetically and pharmacologically manipulating the TMEM16F- mediated phosphatidylserine (PS) exposure. Particularly, I will examine the effects of TMEM16F- mediated phospholipid transport on the PS binding proteins and their downstream signaling pathways in vitro. I will examine the physiological roles of TMEM16F in the excitable neurons and nonexcitable glial cells, two major cell types in the brain, to investigate the in vivo functions of the lipid scramblase. I will also develop pharmacological reagents to manipulate TMEM16F function. My overall goal is to understand the molecular, cellular and physiological mechanisms of transbilayer lipid phenomenon and its impacts on human health and disease."
"9337497","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         The overarching long-term vision of our research is to create novel technologies for processing clinical free text. We will build upon the previous work of our ongoing project Temporal relation discovery for clinical text (R01LM010090) dubbed Temporal Histories of Your Medical Events (THYME; thyme.healthnlp.org) which has been focusing on methodology for event, temporal expressions and temporal relations discovery from the clinical text residing in the Electronic Health Records (EHR). We developed a comprehensive approach to temporality in the clinical text and innovated in computable temporal representations, methods for temporal relation discovery and their evaluation, rendering temporality to end users - resulting in over 35+ papers and presentations. Our dissemination is international and far-reaching as the best performing methods are released open source as part of the Apache Clinical Text Analysis and Knowledge Extraction System (ctakes.apache.org). The methods we developed are now being used in such nation-wide initiatives as the Electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE), Pharmacogenomics Network (PGRN), Informatics for Integrating the Biology and the Bedside (i2b2), Patient Centered Outcomes Research Institute and National Cancer Institute's Informatics Technology for Cancer Research (ITCR). Through our participation in organizing major international bakeoffs - CLEF/ShARe 2014, SemEval 2014 Analysis of Clinical Text Task 7, SemEval 2015 Analysis of Clinical Text Task 14, SemEval 2015 Clinical TempEval Task 6 - we further disseminated the THYME resources and challenged the international research community to explore new solutions to the unsolved temporality task. Through all these activities it became clear that computational approaches to temporality still present great challenges and usability of the output is still limited. Therefore, we propose to further innovate on methodologies and end user experience.             Specific Aim 1: Extract enhanced representations and novel features to support deriving timeline information.

"9439431","Shorter allograft survival is observed for kidneys transplanted from deceased African American donors relative to those from deceased European American donors. Recent retrospective reports have indicated that the presence of two apolipoprotein L1 gene (APOL1) renal-risk variants in the kidney donors significantly contributes to this disparity. APOL1 renal-risk variants are common in U.S. populations with African ancestry (primarily African Americans) and are strongly associated with end-stage renal disease for patients with non- diabetic kidney disease, yet these risk variants are rare in other ethnic groups. Before APOL1 genotypic data can be widely applied in the transplant community, however, a prospective multi-center study must be performed to evaluate outcomes of kidneys from donors with African ancestry. Critical clinical post-transplant information that was lacking in the prior retrospective studies needs to be collected, particularly kidney-biopsy data and key potential modifiers such as development of viral infections, donor-specific antibodies, and episodes of acute rejection. The NIH will fund a nationwide prospective study to assess the impact of APOL1 renal-risk variants on the outcomes of recipients of a kidney from a deceased or living donor with African ancestry and on the kidney health of living donors with African ancestry after nephrectomy. The study will consist of as many as 15 Clinical Centers and a central Scientific Data Research Center (SDRC). The Clinical Centers will collect one-time blood samples from each participant for APOL1 genotyping at the SDRC and will submit longitudinal clinical data for the recipients and living donors to the SDRC to assess the impact of APOL1 genotype on development of chronic kidney disease or end-stage renal disease. The results from this national study have the potential to transform organ allocation and informed consent processes in the transplantation of kidneys from donors with African ancestry, improve renal allograft survival, and provide a better understanding of the mechanisms whereby APOL1 renal-risk variants produce kidney disease."
"9469025","PROJECT SUMMARY Comorbidity between alcoholism and other psychiatric disorders such as depression is extremely common. Determining how the circuitries of these conditions overlap is critical for the development of therapeutics targeting specific populations of alcoholic patients. Our group has recently determined a bidirectional relationship between alcohol exposure and stress-sensitivity which will be further investigated in this proposal. The neuroimmune system has gained attention in recent decades for its involvement in psychiatric conditions, indicating its signaling processes as promising targets for treating comorbid disorders. Of specific interest to our laboratory is the transcription factor nuclear factor ? light chain enhancer of activated B cells (NFkB). NFkB is activated following alcohol exposure and is implicated in behavioral processes such as consumption and reward. NFkB is also involved in the development of depressive-like symptoms that arise from exposure to social defeat stress (SDS), a major preclinical model of depression. As such, the multifaceted roles of NFkB suggest that this transcription factor may influence the circuitries underlying the development of both alcohol abuse and depression. To further study the role of NFkB in these processes, Aim 1 will examine the effects of SDS on alcohol reward via conditioned place preference (CPP) in NFkB-LacZ reporter mice. We expect that mice susceptible to defeat stress will display enhanced alcohol reward, and this elevated reward will associate with increased NFkB activity in regions of interest such as the nucleus accumbens. With selective inhibition of NFkB in the regions identified using the novel prodrug Daun02, we suspect that the increase in reward in susceptible animals will be attenuated. Aim 2 will explore the opposite phenomenon, that alcohol exposure increases sensitivity to subthreshold SDS. We expect that chronic alcohol exposure stimulates NFkB activity in specific regions of interest such as the basolateral and central amygdala, and selectively blocking NFkB in these regions with Daun02 will diminish sensitivity to SDS. We also suspect that lipopolysaccharide, a potent inducer of the neuroimmune system and NFkB activity, will mimic these effects and increase sensitivity to SDS. These studies will advance our current knowledge of the mechanisms underlying alcohol reward and stress- sensitivity as well as the involvement of NFkB in these circuitries. The results obtained from this proposal will further corroborate the promising therapeutic potential of targeting NFkB, as evidenced by its pivotal involvement in many important behavioral processes linking alcoholism and stress-sensitivity."
"9333956","Abstract  Bone conduction (BC) is the transmission of sound to the inner ear by way of skull vibration. Both bone conduction and air conduction (AC), the usual pathway by which sound reaches the inner ear, stimulate the organ of hearing within the cochlea in the same manner. Bone conduction is important clinically, as it is used to diagnose and treat chronic and congenital middle-ear disease. BC hearing aids overcome conductive hearing loss by bypassing the middle ear, allowing the inner-ear mechanisms of BC to stimulate the sensory hair cells of the cochlea. Bone-conduction headphones are being used in noisy environments to aid in communication while simultaneously allowing for the use of hearing protection to AC stimulus. Additionally, BC headphones may be used when it is necessary to maintain an open external ear, so as to not compromise AC hearing. In order improve such devices and to develop more-controlled tests for hearing loss, we need a complete model of BC stimulation of the normal and pathological ear.  BC hearing comprises three major components that act primarily on the 1) external, 2) middle, and 3) inner ear. Their relative contributions to hearing are not fully understood. We aim to quantify the contributions of the external- and inner-ear components in chinchilla, as they are comprised of several mechanisms, and to develop and test a network model for BC hearing in chinchilla and human. The contribution of the inner-ear mechanisms (fluid inertia, compression by bone, and transmission of sound pressure via cerebrospinal fluid) will be determined from measurements of intracochlear pressures (stapes velocity and cochlear sound pressure) during BC stimulation. Contribution of the external-ear mechanisms (ear canal compression, motion of the tympanic membrane with respect to the skull bone, and vibration of the jaw bone) will be determined from measurements of ear canal sound pressure and tympanic membrane velocity during AC and BC stimulation.  For further understanding of BC mechanisms, we optimize a simple model of the middle ear to fit modern AC sound data from chinchilla, an animal with human-like middle-ear structures and frequency range of hearing that has been used to study noise-related hearing loss. We add suitable BC sources to our model, with their frequency dependence defined by our measurements. We will optimize our model parameters using novel techniques we have developed. The model will be generalized to a human BC model, and tested and optimized using existing human BC data. Our model will allow us to investigate the effects of ear disease on hearing and to develop better BC-based devices for both treatment of ear disease and alternative modes of communication."
"9445027","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Despite the ubiquitous inclusion of engineered nanomaterials (ENM) in widespread applications, and their projected proliferation in human endeavors; the consequences of maternal ENM inhalation on the developing fetus and their impacts on future health are at best, vague. The advancement of nanotechnology, and ?nano- enabled? devices holds tremendous potential to advance human health exponentially, yet their unknown health effects remain the critical rate limiting step. To date, studies focus on the fetal consequences of artificially injected ENM or the ability of co-incubated ENM to cross the placenta. These fail to address the most relevant health risks: 1) how do inhaled ENM impair the development of a healthy uterine vasculature, and 2) how do inhaled ENM impair placental development, or compromise its function? We will define the fetal consequences of maternal ENM exposure in terms of altered mechanisms of uterine and placental vascular health. ENM aerosol generation and rodent exposures will be performed in state-of-the-art inhalation exposure facilities that have recently undergone significant expansion to directly meet the unique demands of this project. AIM 1: Determine the impact of maternal ENM inhalation on uterine microvascular health during gestation, and characterize the underlying mechanisms of dysfunction. We have defined the impact of ENM inhalation on microvascular health, in the virgin uterus, with novel intravital microscopy studies. We now expand this investigation to discrete stages of pregnancy. We hypothesize that the vasculogenic and angiogenic mechanisms initiated by pregnancy and stimulate rapid microvascular network growth are susceptible targets of the extrapulmonary mediators activated by ENM inhalation. AIM 2: Identify the impact of maternal ENM inhalation on placental health during gestation and characterize the underlying mechanisms of dysfunction. The placenta is a highly vascularized organ critical to fetal health/development, and is a systemic target of extrapulmonary mediators. A second novel technique, the ex vivo perfused placenta will be used to test our working hypothesis ? maternal ENM inhalation disrupts placental vascular integrity via prostanoid and nitric oxide mediated mechanisms. AIM 3: Define the cardiovascular health consequences that persist into adulthood that stem from fetal epigenetic alterations that occur during maternal ENM inhalation during gestation. We hypothesize that the hostile gestational environment created by maternal ENM inhalation produces a genotype that not only displays impaired cardiovascular function, but also elevated sensitivity to xenobiotic exposures in adulthood. Project outcomes: the fundamental relationships between uterine, placental, and fetal microvascular health after maternal ENM exposure will be identified. We also expect to have clarified many of the major mechanisms mediating these outcomes. Identifying these relationships will assist and facilitate efforts towards: risk evaluation, development of exposure controls, and safety by design. The integration of such knowledge will be a critical step in advancing sustainable nanotechnologies."
"9565015","Project Summary Alzheimer's disease (AD) creates substantial human suffering and social financial burdens. At present, the search for effective disease-modifying AD treatments is substantially hampered by our incomplete understanding of the cellular mechanisms and pathways that change in human neurons during AD. Here we propose to substantially increase our understanding of these problems by testing an overarching hypothesis tying variation in Amyloid Precursor Protein (APP) transcytotic trafficking to pathways that lead to AD. Specifically, we propose to test the hypothesis that one major contributor to the molecular and cellular complexity of AD derives from variability in branches of pathways controlling trafficking of APP and its fragments to the neuronal axon. This hypothesis emerges in part from the likely endocytic nature of a number of functions identified by GWAS and in part from our recent work on neuronal trafficking defects in a series of FAD mutations we generated and analyzed using human induced pluripotent stem cell (hIPSC) technology. We also propose to increase our understanding of the uniquely neuronal endocytic and transcytotic pathways mediating APP trafficking to neuronal axons. This trafficking is key to the anatomical location of A? secretion, plaque formation, APP proteolytic processing and the control of axon-specific tau phosphorylation leading to the formation of pathogenic tau aggregates called neurofibrillary tangles (NFT). Thus, we also propose to test a unique model we have developed that describes two different pathways for APP entry into neuronal axons, one of which we suggest controls axonal tau phosphorylation. We will then extend this work to study FAD and AD-protective APP mutations and their interaction with the traffic pathways of APP to the axon. The proposed three specific aims are: 1) Test the hypothesis that there are two somatodendritic pathways that traffic APP to neuronal axons. 2) Test the mechanistic hypothesis that direct interactions of APP and SORLA mediate transcytotic functions that modulate axonal entry and amyloidogenic processing of APP. 3) Test the hypothesis that ESCRT- functions control endo-lysosomal trafficking of APP and subsequent transcytotic amyloidogenic processing and axonal entry. Collectively, the proposed experiments will provide mechanistic insights into the various branches of APP trafficking which are critical for amyloidogenic APP processing and phospho-tau levels, opening up new avenues in AD research and identification of potential targets for therapeutic intervention."
"9447454","Abstract: New technologies such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) have aided our ability to understand human brain function. Distinguishing causal from spurious relationships is of great interest and importance for both basic neuroscience and applications in medicine, drug development, and clinical practice. Neuroscientists want to know how experimental stimuli affect brain function, how neural activity in different brain regions are causally linked, and how neural activity mediates the relationship between a stimulus and an outcome. Researchers apply various statistical procedures (e.g., Granger causality, dynamic causal models, structural equation models, and directed graphical models) to fMRI data, interpreting the resulting associations as effects, often inappropriately. This is a major problem. The previous funding cycle of this grant laid the groundwork for a principled approach to casual inference in neuroscience research, employing the potential outcomes notation used in the statistical literature on causal inference. Here we seek to extend the frame- work developed there to better study mediation, where neural activity in one or more brain regions mediates a treatment-outcome relationship, and effective connectivity, where activations in different regions are causally linked. To begin, we de?ne new causal effects and construct a new whole brain model that will facilitate the study of localization, mediation, and effective connectivity at the regional level under assumptions more realistic than those typically made in modeling fMRI data. Further, we create a new statistical method for conduct- ing high-dimensional mediation analysis that identi?es networks that may mediate the relationship between a treatment and outcome. Finally, building on the literature on instrumental variables and structural equation mod- els, we develop new methods for studying mediation and effective connectivity after the application of external neurostimulation using recently developed technologies such as transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) that are starting to see widespread use in both theoretical neuro- science and applied contexts. We apply the methods to fMRI data from studies of post-traumatic stress disorder, thermal pain and social evaluation."
"9315702","Project Summary/Abstract  Opioid Use Disorder has seen an epidemic rise in the United States over the past decade. More than 250 million prescriptions for opioids are written each year along with increasing rates of illegal heroin use. Greater than 4 million Americans report using prescription pain medicine for non-medical reasons. Colorado has outpaced the rest of the nation and recently ranked as high as number 2 in the nation for rates of self-reported nonmedical use of prescription pain killers. Opioid overdoses killed 41 Coloradans per month in 2014 and 14 of the 24 counties in our proposed project have drug overdose rates greater than 16 per 100,000 placing them among the worst in the nation.  There are evidence-based guidelines and recommendations for prescribing opioids and for treating Opioid Use Disorder (OUD). However, the magnitude of the work required to disseminate and implement evidence from medical research into clinical practice has been underestimated. Myriad barriers to implementation include: complex definitions, the diverse nature of primary care, and unique cultural aspects or rural communities. Implementation must be more than simply transposing one program into another venue.  Over the past 5 years, the High Plains Research Network in rural eastern and southern Colorado has identified Opioid Use Disorder as a primary concern to our physicians, practices, and community members. HPRN providers and community members point out the problems they face; lack of community knowledge and awareness of OUD and medication assisted treatment (MAT), limited access to diagnostic and treatment services for OUD, and the complete lack of MAT.  The HPRN has a goal to change the trajectory of this epidemic, improve the community level awareness of OUD, and successfully manage patients with OUD through primary care practice-based Medication Assisted Treatment. First, we propose to increase local community awareness and knowledge by completing a Boot Camp Translation, transforming the complex language and concepts of OUD and MAT into locally relevant, actionable messages and materials. Second, we will provide up-to-date evidence-based education on OUD and MAT comparing onsite and online training models. Finally, we will provide rural primary care practices with Opisafe, a robust web-based opioid and MAT patient engagement and monitoring system that provides valuable patient-centered follow-up tracking and complies with and meets all federal and state regulatory requirements. Mixed-method evaluation will identify the impact of community awareness on implementation success, identify the best methods for practice and provider team- based education, and the impact of an innovative web-based registry and tracking system on implementation and patient outcomes."
"9564362","PROJECT SUMMARY  Children with a genetic disease or birth defect are hospitalized at a younger age, stay longer, and have a higher death rate than children hospitalized for other reasons. One in 33 infants born in the US has a birth defect; the number one cause of infant mortality. Our long-term goal is to change these dire statistics by delineating the mechanisms that reduce game quality by increasing mutagenesis in male gametes with increasing age, i.e., the paternal age effect. The paternal age effect is increasingly significant with increasing birth rates to older fathers, and is directly relevant to male reproductive health and child health. Previously published studies revealed that reduced base excision repair protein APE1, results in reduced base excision repair and increased mutagenesis in spermatogenic cells with increasing age. Preliminary data leads us to test the hypothesis that MDM2 ubiquitination of APE1 is triggered by TRP53 Ser18/23 phosphorylation resulting in reduced APE1. Aim 1: Test whether MDM2 ubiquitinates APE1, leading to greater amounts of highly ubiquitinated APE1 in germ cells of older mice, proteasomal degradation of APE1, and a greater spontaneous mutation frequency. Aim 2: Test whether phosphorylation of TRP53 at Ser18/23 triggers degradation of APE1 in spermatogenic cells from older mice. Aim 3: Test whether changes in APE1 abundance, and mechanisms driving those changes, originate in the spermatogonial stem cell population. Methods: Defined spermatogenic cells will be prepared from male mice carrying targeted changes in Mdm2 and Trp53 to test whether these tumor suppressors regulate APE1 abundance in young mice and become chronically activated in old wild type mice resulting in reduced APE1 abundance, reduced base excision repair and increased mutagenesis. The importance of proteasome degradation and MDM2 activity will be tested using inhibitors. CometChip arrays will analyze DNA damage in single cells to determine if increased DNA damage may trigger TRP53 activation. Duplex tag next generation sequencing will determine if increases in mutation frequency initiate in the spermatogonial stem cell population. We propose a novel model in which tumor suppressors that function normally to safeguard genome integrity, instead cause decreased gamete quality and increased mutagenesis by reducing APE1 abundance in the unique biological context of germ cells and aging. This is a paradigm shift from the widely-held view of mutations accumulating passively in stem cells as the major driving force of reduced genetic quality in male gametes with aging and for the role of TRP53 and MDM2 as protectors of the genome."
"9455430","Summary The neural growth factors known as neurotrophins are hypothesized to play central roles in sleep homeostasis; an enigmatic process that regulates sleep need. Brain neurotrophin mRNA and protein levels increase with wakefulness and administration of exogenous neurotrophin increases sleep time and indices of sleep intensity. Neurotrophins are secreted by active neurons where they can act globally throughout the brain, or locally in a use-dependent fashion. Neurotrophins also govern cellular processes linked to sleep function including brain cell survival and synaptic plasticity. Nevertheless, the precise role of neurotrophins in sleep and sleep regulation is unclear. This is because previous investigations have relied on non-selective pharmacological agents, non-physiological neurotrophin concentrations, or are principally correlational in nature. We will more precisely determine the role of neurotrophins in sleep regulation using a novel chemo-genetic technique that allows for rapid and reversible inhibition of all three neurotrophin-TrK receptors in vivo. This is accomplished using transgenic mice with knock-in TrKA, B or C receptors that are potently inhibited in the presence of a small, brain permeable molecule. We will use this model to determine the role of each TrK receptor in sleep homeostasis and genome-wide changes in mRNA expression that accompany the accumulation and discharge of sleep need."
"9448277","Project Summary / Abstract  Cholesterol metabolism in Mtb is an attractive target for basic research and new drug development efforts. The Mtb cholesterol metabolic pathway is specific to the bacteria and mutants defective in this pathway are attenuated in various infection models. This suggests that chemically inhibiting this pathway will also attenuate Mtb virulence in vivo. We recently discovered a compound series that blocks cholesterol uptake in Mtb and stimulates cAMP overproduction in the bacteria. This is important since cAMP regulates mycobacterial central metabolism, transcription, pathogenicity, dormancy, and stress responses. Thus, chemically stimulating cAMP production in Mtb will perturb multiple different aspects of bacterial physiology in addition to cholesterol utilization.  Granulomas are a major pathologic barrier that limits immune cell recruitment and antibiotic diffusion. Within a granuloma Mtb is sequestered in a cholesterol rich and hypoxic microenvironment that is thought to favor bacterial persistence. During infection, M??s produce TNF-? which drives TB tissue pathology and is required to form and maintain granulomas. It is thought that TNF-? depletion can disturb the granuloma architecture and promote enhanced antibiotic availability or disrupt the granuloma microenvironment making TB antibiotics more effective. It has long been known that TNF-? production by M??s can be down regulated in response to high levels of cytosolic cAMP and it is also known that Mtb-derived cAMP down regulates TNF-? production in M??s. Our compound series stimulates enough Mtb-derived cAMP to down regulate TNF-? production at the infected cell level. Thus, stimulating cAMP overproduction in Mtb could be a novel strategy to reduce TNF-? levels specifically in infected M??s to enhance the activity of current TB drugs.  Here we propose to characterize the molecular mechanisms of how these probes block cholesterol uptake and stimulate the overproduction of cAMP in Mtb (Aim 1). We also will determine how Mtb-derived cAMP modulates: (i) the host immune response, (ii) M? function, and (iii) evaluate the efficacy of V-59 alone and in combination with known TB antibiotics in vivo with a goal of evaluating the therapeutic potential of V-59 (Aim 2). Because we already have a compound that has excellent potency and demonstrates in vivo efficacy via the oral route, we are well positioned to make progress with a potential TB drug candidate and novel treatment strategy."
"9312420","Summary The principal goal of this proposal is to increase the accuracy and precision of a low-cost autorefraction device called the QuickSee, in order to improve access to refractive eye care for underserved populations. Poor vision due to a lack of eyeglasses is highly prevalent in low-resource settings throughout the world and significantly reduces quality of life, education, and productivity. The existing QuickSee only extracts the lower- order aberration information contained within a wavefront profile of the eye, to roughly estimate an eyeglass prescription. This proposal will further improve the accuracy of the QuickSee device by exploiting both the lower- and higher-order aberrations contained within the complete wavefront. To realize this goal, we will enroll 300 subjects (600 eyes) in Baltimore, MD, and will obtain subjective refraction and visual acuity (VA) measurements and will use machine learning on this large dataset of wavefront profiles to optimize the wavefront-to-refraction algorithm of the QuickSee device. The main output of this project will be a robust and improved-accuracy next-generation QuickSee device that will increase efficiency of and decrease the training requirements of eye care professionals, and potentially dispense refractive correction that provides similar or better VA than correction from an eye care professional. Successful completion of this work will be an important step towards dramatically improving eyeglass accessibility for health disparity populations in the USA and internationally in low-resource settings. Upon completion of this proposal, we will apply for a Phase II award proposing to work with Wilmer Eye Institute research faculty to assess widespread deployment of the next-generation QuickSee with minimally-trained personnel in order to accurately and reliably provide thousands of pairs of low-cost corrective eyeglasses to underserved communities."
"9547730","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The objective of this grant proposal is to perform a clinical study which will allow the first foldable and injectable artificial cornea, the KeraKlear, to be used in the United States market for treatment of corneal blindness. This device may be implanted through an incision size that is approximately 1/10th the size of the incision that is required for the most popular artificial cornea available in the U.S. The smaller incision size is expected to allow a much quicker surgery for patients and a more accelerated recovery as compared to the currently available artificial corneas. In addition, the KeraKlear artificial cornea may be implanted in many patients with cornea blindness without penetration into the anterior chamber. This avoids two of the most serious complications of artificial cornea implantation including internal infection of the eye (endophthalmitis) and severe bleeding (expulsive hemorrhage). The use of the KeraKlear artificial cornea also avoids the common complications of corneal transplantation including high astigmatism, corneal graft failure and corneal graft rejection. Finally, the KeraKlear would enable the treatment of cornea blindness in a much larger number of patients. Currently, corneal transplantation is limited to about 100,000 per year worldwide because of the lack of suitable donor corneas. This represents only 1% of the 10 million people worldwide who have cornea blindness in both eyes. By making the KeraKlear artificial cornea available a significantly larger percentage of the cornea blind patients around the world could be treated."
"9398480","The most prevalent primary brain tumor, glioblastoma (GBM), ranks among the most lethal of human cancers. Like the normal brain, GBMs contain cellular hierarchies with self-renewing, multi-lineage cells at the apex. These brain tumor initiating cells (BTICs), or GBM stem cells, display therapeutic resistance, promote tumor angiogenesis, and invade into normal tissues. BTICs are not uniformly distributed, but rather concentrated in specific regions, or niches, including around blood vessels (the perivascular niche) and in perinecrotic (hypoxic) regions. These niches provide essential cues that maintain stem-like tumor cells through several pathways that appear specific for each location. In preliminary studies, we find that biopsies of specific GBM regions contain tumor cells with divergent transcriptional profiles and precursor markers. Cellular differentiation states reflect the cumulative regulation of chromatin, so we examined the expression and activity of two core epigenetic regulatory nodes: polycomb repressive complexes 1 and 2 (PRC1/2). Vascular tumor regions were associated with PRC2 activity, whereas hypoxic regions were associated with measures of PRC1. Collectively, these results suggest that stem-like cancer cells residing in different locations may be regulated by different epigenetic programs. Enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) is a histone-lysine N-methyltransferase enzyme that serves as the enzymatic component of PRC2. B lymphoma Mo-MLV insertion region 1 homolog (BMI1) is an essential component of PRC1. Both EZH2 and BMI1 have been linked to normal and neoplastic stem cells, as well as therapeutic resistance. Clinical relevance for BMI1 and EZH2 is supported by the development of targeted therapies against each molecule. We find that mesenchymal BTICs display preferential activity and dependence on BMI1, whereas proneural BTICs display preferential activity and dependence on EZH2. As GBMs contain a mixture of proneural and mesenchymal tumor cells, we hypothesized that combined targeting of BMI1 and EZH2 will offer improved tumor control with acceptable toxicity. Further, we have identified a novel molecular regulatory mechanism of BMI1 linked to the hypoxic microenvironment that may inform patient selection for precision (personalized) medicine application of epigenetic targeting. Finally, additional studies will determine the potential of this therapeutic regimen to synergize with conventional therapies against glioblastoma. Collectively, these studies will investigate novel molecular regulation by the tumor microenvironment of neoplastic stem cells that can be directly translated into clinical trials."
"9470491","Project Summary: The development of the central nervous system requires the precise control of axon outgrowth. This outgrowth is primarily achieved by a highly motile, actin-rich structure at the tips of axons, called the axon growth cone. The growth cone is highly responsive to extracellular cues, which are transduced by finger-like protrusions called filopodia. These cues drive rearrangement of the actin cytoskeleton to produce specific growth cone behaviors. While much is known about guidance cues and their receptors, the pathways by which cues drive cytoskeletal rearrangement are not well understood. LIM and SH3 Protein 1 (LASP1) is a unique actin-binding protein that contains multiple protein interaction domains and several phosphorylation sites, thus may function to mediate complex signaling pathways to regulate actin dynamics. The LASP1 gene is implicated in autism and schizophrenia, and LASP1 expression is correlated with cellular motility of many types of cancer cells. Within the brain, LASP1 has been shown to be highly expressed in the growth cone during development. Our preliminary data indicate that LASP1 localizes to the leading edge of growth cones, which is known to be the site of actin polymerization and protrusion. However, the role of LASP1 in actin dynamics and growth cone behaviors are not well understood. Given that LASP1 expression levels positively correlate with actin-based cellular motility, and that LASP1 has been shown to be essential for chemokine-directed motility of immune cells, I hypothesize that LASP1 promotes actin polymerization downstream of axon guidance cues in the growth cone. I will test this hypothesis using high resolution microscopy and molecular approaches, in both in vivo and in vitro models. Specifically, I propose to complete experiments that examine the role of LASP1 function at the leading edge, as well as its function in axonal outgrowth, guidance, and branching. Completion of these experiments will elucidate the mechanism of LASP1 in actin-based motility as well as neurological disease and cancer metastasis."
"9302363","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): 1 Slip and fall accidents are a major and growing source of occupational injuries. Shoes that are heavily worn 2 have reduced coefficient of friction (COF) and are associated with increased slipping risk. The mechanism 3 causing this loss of friction is that worn tread can no longer channel fluids from beneath the shoe, which causes 4 the fluid to become pressurized, the COF to decrease and the slip risk to increase. Key knowledge gaps exist 5 regarding the factors that contribute to shoe wear rate and the wear thresholds at which COF begins to 6 decrease. This gap inhibits selection of wear-resistant shoes and programs that replace shoes before they 7 become too worn. The overall objective of this R01 study is to fill this gap by identifying the underlying 8 causes to shoe wear and identifying the tread thresholds where shoes become unsafe. The proposed research  9 will accomplish this goal with: 1) experiments that identify the factors that contribute to wear rate (Aim 1) and 10 replacement thresholds for worn shoes (Aim 2); 2) a computational model that predicts wear rate and the life 11 expectancy of shoes (Aim 3); 3) a validation of Aims 1 and 3 based on tracking wear in occupational settings 12 (Aim 4); and 4) a validation of Aim 2 based on unexpected slips of participants donning naturally worn shoes 13 (Aim 5). To accomplish Aims 1 and 2, a shoe wear tester will reproduce the kinetics of stepping repeatedly to 14 accelerate the wear of the shoe tread. For Aim 1, the effects of shoe material and tread design on tread wear 15 rate will be quantified. For Aim 2, the impact of wear on COF and under-shoe fluid pressures will be 16 determined and tread thresholds where fluid pressures start to significantly increase will be identified. The 17 impact of fluid pressures on COF will be tested. For Aim 3, an iterative FEA model will be developed that 18 calculates wear based on the contact pressures and then updates the shoe geometry based on the calculated 19 wear. For Aim 4, two cohorts of twenty participants (one from Nabors Industries and one cohort from general 20 industry) will wear two different shoe designs. Shoe wear and number of steps will be tracked to validate the 21 degree to which the wear rates observed in the experiments (Aim 1) and the model (Aim 3) reflect actual wear 22 experienced in industry. For Aim 5, sixty individuals will be unexpectedly slipped while wearing naturally 23 worn shoes. This aim will validate the effect of shoes worn beyond their replacement limits (determined in Aim 24 2) on slip risk. This proposal will meet NIOSH's Research to Practice (R2P) initiative by identifying the 25 factors that affect the life of shoes and their replacement limits, which will be translated to practice through 26 industry partners, publications and training programs. The outputs of this research will be new knowledge on 27 when worn shoes should be replaced, what factors influence wear, and a computational model of shoe wear. 28 The outcomes will be improved shoe design and replacement policies that lead to a reduction in slip and fall 29 accidents from worn shoes. This research will address NORA Strategic Goals for Manufacturing (Goal 2), 30 Wholesale and Retail Trade (Goal 2) and Oil and Gas Extraction (Goal 4.2)."
"9421009","Project Summary In this application we propose to develop the endoscopic ultrasound fine-needle optical diagnostic system that can determine the cellular composition of pancreatic cysts in vivo and identify cystic lesions with early stage cancer features.  Pancreatic cancer is the 3rd leading cause of cancer-related death in the United States, surpassing breast cancer. With a median survival of 3 months, it has the highest mortality rate of all major cancers. The poor prognosis of pancreatic cancer is due in large part to the inability to detect this cancer at an early stage, when the option of a curative surgical resection is still possible. It is estimated that 8 million Americans have pancreatic cystic lesions. Pancreatic cysts are the only readily identifiable precursors of pancreatic cancer. Most commonly, these asymptomatic cysts are found incidentally when MRI/CT imaging is performed for other purposes and then monitored with these imaging techniques for interval growth since about 1 in 10 cysts have malignant potential. While CT and MRI could be used to screen for cystic lesions, they have poor accuracy with regard to distinguishing cancerous and pre-cancerous cysts from benign cysts. Currently, there is no accurate diagnostic technique that can distinguish cancerous and pre-cancerous cysts from benign cysts, resulting in dire consequences, including the development of cancer in cysts thought to be benign, or unnecessary pancreatic surgery for benign cysts, often with significant morbidity and mortality. Thus, there is a critical need for a new diagnostic approach that accurately identifies those pancreatic cysts that require surgical intervention and those that do not.  Recently we introduced a new diagnostic technology based on light scattering spectroscopy (LSS) that identifies the malignant potential of pancreatic cystic lesions during routine diagnostic minimally invasive endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration (EUS- FNA) procedures. It employs a single-point forward looking spatial gating contact probe that fits into a standard aspiration needle and samples a fraction of the internal surface of the cyst forward hemisphere in approximately 2 minutes. To improve accuracy and ensure clinical acceptance of the technique, scanning the entire internal cyst surface in a shorter time would be a significant advance. Our preliminary results are very encouraging, indicating that the proposed technology could be a tremendous aid in identifying both precursor lesions and early stage pancreatic cancers."
"9354204","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Percutaneous osseointegrated prosthetic attachment or the direct skeletal attachment of artificial limbs, across the amputation stump skin into the residual bone, is a rapidly evolving technology that is now ready to be introduced into the United States, following greater than a decade of European trials that largely involved transfemoral amputees. Translational animal research carried out over the past seven years at the Bone and Joint Research Laboratory, VAH, Salt Lake City, Utah, has clarified principles of osseointegration, and bone and skin interface responses to chronic weight bearing of the residual bone containing a percutaneous implant. This information has produced new prosthetic designs that make the technique safer and more likely to succeed over the long-term. This translational animal data, gathered parallel to the European human data, has made possible an Early Feasibility Device Exemption (IDE) Pilot Program under the direction of the FDA. This trial is anticipated to begin in May 2014, at the VAH in Salt Lake City, Utah, and is funded by VA RR&D grant (RX001208-01). Ten transfemoral amputees, selected from the veteran and active military populations will receive the device. The critical limiting factor to the prior U.S. introduction of this technology has been an up to 30% infection rate at the implant/skin interface in European patients. Evolving designs and surgical techniques have lowered this incidence, but it remains remarkable that 70% to perhaps 95% of European patients now remain infection free with simply mild soap and shower hygiene at the stoma, and avoid the use of antibiotics. In fact antibiotics and disinfectants are often counter productive, and lead to antibiotic resistance. It seems increasingly evident that the key to this improbable success is the biology and mutualistic-commensal microbiota at the skin/implant interface: the bacterial guard dogs at the gate.  This pending 10 patient Pilot Tria offers a unique, 1 year long, opportunity to study the evolving microbiota (Aim 1), and the wound healing and inflammatory cytokine environment of the skin/implant interface and surrounding skin as well as the systemic immune protein response to this percutaneous device (Aim 2); all determined at the same time points. Hopefully, this study will give measurable understanding as to why stomas do or don't become infected and to anticipate the onset of infection (Primary Goal). Serial skin swab bacterial DNA samples will be collected beginning with the Stage 1 surgery (device implantation with wound closure and primary wound healing) and 6 weeks later the Stage 2 surgery (establishment of the stoma; a chronic wound). Amplification of the bacterial 16S rRNA genes, obtained from this DNA, will be followed by sequencing on the Illumina MiSeq platform and will determine the resident microbiota at the stoma and adjacent thigh skin throughout the processes of primary wound healing and chronic stomal maturation. Simultaneous to the microbiome collection, venous blood and stomal exudate specimens will be obtained to compare systemic versus local inflammatory protein responses. The serial venous blood samples will be used to determine the instantaneous status of the host immune system and will be subjected to microarray analysis of immune system proteins using custom TaqMan microfluidic array cards (192 genes). This will measure the up and down regulation of host mRNA that translates the synthesis of immune system proteins i.e. cytokines and chemokines. Analysis of the stomal-exudate, using the BioPlex multiplex immunoassay and MagPix platform, will measure the levels of 27 wound healing and inflammatory cytokines in the local wound environment. Statistical analyses will compare each patient against himself/herself over time, and against the others (commonality of microbiota and infection vs. a stable, and uninfected stoma)."
"9353755","In order to qualify for substantial tax exemptions, nonprofit hospitals must provide certain types of community benefit in the jurisdictions they serve. Due to specific requirements associated with the Affordable Care Act (ACA) and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), as well as changing market conditions, it is anticipated that a significant portion of hospital community benefit expenditures will shift from charity care toward other activities. There are vast resources at stake, an excess of $60 billion annually is currently spent on community benefit activities and there is tremendous potential for those resources to serve an important role in integrating healthcare and public health infrastructure. Our proposed research targets a critical need to understand (1) how hospitals fulfill their community benefit requirements, (2) the ways in which hospital community benefit activities evolve in response to the ACA, (3) what factors facilitate authentic engagement with community and public health infrastructure by nonprofit hospitals, and (4) which community benefit activities are effective at improving the population health and well-being. We propose an iterative mixed quantitative and qualitative approach. The findings that emerge from the quantitative study will inform the design and sample of the qualitative study. The information generated in the qualitative study will be tested quantitatively to assess their generalizability to other hospitals and market areas. The ultimate goal is to develop evidence-based recommendations for hospital administrators and policy-makers about best practices with the goal of increasing the effectiveness of community benefit spending to improve population health and well-being.  The quantitative study is focused on analyzing the shift from uncompensated/charity care spending to the multitude of ways in which nonprofit hospitals respond to the changing community benefit landscape. We propose to apply econometric techniques to analyze pre- and post-ACA changes in the type and magnitude of spending by comparing pre-post changes in spending by hospitals in states that expanded Medicaid to those that did not expand Medicaid. This approach will be used to identify and characterize the substitution between types of spending and assess the degree that spending is responsive to local market needs. Our primary data sources include (1) IRS tax filings that provide qualitative and quantitative detail on the type and amount of community benefit spending and (2) hospital financial data from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) Hospital Cost Report Information System (HCRIS). The results will also be used to identify dynamic systems and hospitals for in-depth qualitative interviews. The qualitative analysis will identify innovative models and approaches to community benefit activities. This analysis is critical to understanding ways in which nonprofit hospital community benefit activities improve the health and well-being of the populations they serve. This knowledge will be useful to nonprofit hospitals and policy-makers at all levels as they consider potential alternative avenues for expending community benefit dollars."

"9416386","Project Summary Systematically collecting patient-reported outcomes measures (PROMs) and using them in both the care of individual patients and as aggregate data for quality improvement of care processes has been a healthcare dream for the past 15 years. However, few organizations make even partial use of such a complete outcomes system. Furthermore, the evidence of impact on those outcomes is of poor quality, and the results are mixed. By partnering with operational leaders in a large medical group that has prioritized building a health information technology (HIT)-based PROMs system as well as obtaining input from both clinicians and patients, we propose to enhance the information collected, improve survey response rates from patients, and facilitate the likelihood of using the information in both the care of individual patients and for quality improvement. The medical group has already begun this initiative, focused initially on patients undergoing knee or hip replacements or spine surgery. We propose to supplement the initiative and to provide a much more complete and thorough scientific evaluation of its use and impacts than would otherwise be possible. Specifically, we propose to:  1. Interview and survey patients to learn what outcomes are important to them (Patient Preferred  Outcomes [PPOs]) and what contextual information (Patient Contextual Information [PCI]) would be  helpful to their clinicians in planning care  2. Test the impact of adding this information to the PROMs survey and HIT outreach on item and survey  response rates in collecting outcomes information  3. Test the impact on outcomes and experience (satisfaction and shared decision-making) from making  individual outcome scores available via the electronic medical record and Internet access during care  4. Test the impact on outcomes and costs over time from providing surgeons with both their aggregate  PROM/PPO scores and the associated care costs in comparison with their peers The results of this research will be used by the medical group as it spreads an advanced PROMs system to other conditions and specialties while also serving as a real-life model system that will be disseminated widely through its strong links to other care systems regionally and nationally."
"9454678","Developmental defects in cranial neural crest (CNC) result in numerous human congenital anomalies. The role of the Hippo-signaling pathway, an evolutionarily conserved organ size control pathway, in neural crest development is poorly understood. To investigate Hippo signaling in CNC derivatives such as calvarial bones, we specifically inactivated the Hippo component Salv, and Hippo downstream effectors Yap and Taz in CNC using the Wnt1cre driver and Wnt1cre2SOR drivers. Salv conditional knock-out (CKO) mutants had dramatically enlarged calvarial bones and cranial sutures with increased calvarial bone density, whereas Taz homozygous mutants that were also Yap heterozygous (Taz hom;Yap het CKO) mutants had a range of survival times from E14.5 to postnatal 8 weeks with a range of calvarial bone defects with Wormian bones and decreased calvarial bone density. In this proposed R03 study, we hypothesize that Yap/Taz-mediated signaling crosstalk in neural crest is required for normal cranial bone development and will study two aims: 1) To investigate the hypothesis that Yap/Taz mediate regulation by Hippo kinases and matrix stiffness during cranial bone development. 2) To investigate the hypothesis that Yap/Taz regulate genes important for proliferation and differentiation during cranial bone development. My research will focus on bone regeneration and treatment of severely injured bone. This R03 study will provide preliminary data and potential targets in bone regenerative medicine for my subsequent R01 application, which I hypothesize that Hippo signaling impedes while Yap promotes bone regeneration and recovery after injury."
"9350588","Our understanding of biological phenomena is often shaped by the technology available to query our system of interest. For years, our understanding of embryonic development has been dictated by static snapshots stemming from technologies that rely on the examination of dead, fixed embryos. In this case, the spatiotemporal evolution of the gene expression programs that shape animal body plans is inferred from static images. The main hypothesis of the proposed work is that the reliance on snapshots rather than movies has hidden deep insights from view relevant to embryonic development. We propose to break free from the reign of static snapshots in the study of developmental biology by introducing new technologies that will make it possible to redo the subject of embryonic development from the standpoint of dynamics through the imaging and quantification of the central dogma in real time at the single cell level within living embryos. We will use the embryonic development of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster as a proof of principle in order to (i) develop new technology to quantify fast changing transcription factor concentrations and the resulting transcriptional output in development, (ii) develop new in vivo fluorescent probes to augment cutting-edge lattice light-sheet microscopy to make it possible to directly visualize how single activators and repressors bind to the DNA, and (iii) combine these input-output measurements with our single-molecule measurements in order to directly visualize the molecular mechanisms by which transcription factors perform their regulatory function in real time in living embryos. We argue that only by enabling this real-time description of gene regulatory programs in development can we reach a quantitative understanding that makes it possible to predict how DNA sequence dictates cellular commitment and how, when this regulation goes awry, developmental defects and states of unchecked cellular proliferation ensue."
"9311446","Deficiencies in choroidal blood flow (ChBF) have long been suggested to underlie age-related retinal decline, and cause the outer retinal abnormalities that set the stage for the inflammatory cascade leading to AMD. Nonetheless, experimental evidence that this is the case has been lacking. We have been investigating both the parasympathetic and sympathetic control of ChBF, and found that the vasodilatory parasympathetic input helps maintain basal ChBF during low systemic blood pressure (BP), while the vasoconstrictory sympathetic input helps maintain basal ChBF during high systemic BP. We have found that this adaptive control, which we term ChBF baroregulation, is impaired by age, and when impaired by experimental manipulations leads to declines in retinal function. The studies proposed here will build on these findings and experimentally determine if impaired neurogenic ChBF baroregulation in the long term leads to the types of outer retinal pathologies that characterize early AMD progression. Three Aims will be pursued. In the first Aim, we will determine the impact of disrupted parasympathetic and/or disrupted sympathetic regulation of ChBF on retinal health and function in rats housed in normal diurnal light. Whole- field scotopic ERG, visual acuity, and contrast sensitivity will be determined at 6 and 12 months post lesion. Choroidal baroregulatory defects will be assessed at the same time points, and animals then sacrificed for morphological and neurochemical analysis of outer retina at these same time points. In the morphological and neurochemical analysis, we will quantify photoreceptor and RPE cell loss, RPE-Bruch's membrane interface pathologies, and the accumulation of oxidized protein, lipid waste and inflammatory proteins typical of AMD progression. We will also determine if choroidal vessel attenuation and pericyte loss are a long-term consequence of disrupted parasympathetic and/or sympathetic control of ChBF.  In our second Aim, we will determine if neurogenic ChBF baroregulation and autonomic innervation are prematurely impaired in complement factor H (CFH) - deficient mice, which show progressive outer retinal and choriocapillaris pathology resembling that in AMD. CFH normally inhibits the alternative complement pathway, and polymorphisms that reduce protein function are AMD risk factors in humans. Assessments of retinal function (ERG, visual acuity and contrast sensitivity) and morphological and neurochemical analyses of outer retina and choroid, as in Aim 1, will be performed in these mice in separate cohorts at 4, 8 and 12 months of age. In the third Aim, we will use immunolabeling to assess the association between outer retinal AMD pathology and loss of innervation of choroid, and the relation of AMD risk genes to innervation loss. Our studies may lead to testing of adaptive regulation of choroidal blood flow (especially in response to blood pressure fluctuations) as an AMD risk assessment, as well as lead to use of drugs that improve neural regulation of choroidal blood flow to slow AMD onset and progression."
"9330221","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Neuropathic pain is a worldwide health problem with limited treatment options due to gaps in our understanding of the underlying mechanisms of this disorder. Nerve-injury induced neuropathic pain is associated with changes in the expression of channels, proteins, and enzymes within the dorsal root ganglion (DRG). Kv1.2, one subtype of voltage-gated potassium channels (Kv) that are responsible for neuronal hyperpolarization, was found to be down-regulated in the injured DRG following nerve- injury. This down-regulation contributes to neuropathic pain genesis, however, the mechanism of how nerve injury causes DRG Kv1.2 channel down-regulation is still incompletely understood. DNA methylation is an epigenetic mechanism of gene transcription regulation that governs gene expression by interfering with interactions of transcription factors with gene promoter. The promoter of the Kv1.2 gene has the binding motif of Oct-1, a transcriptional activator. We recently found that DNMT3a, one of the enzymes that catalyze methylation at CpG islands in genes, was up-regulated in the injured DRG following spinal nerve ligation (SNL). Our preliminary data strongly suggest that DNMT3a is involved in nerve injury-induced DRG Kv1.2 downregulation and contributes to neuropathic pain.  This proposal will determine whether and how nerve injury-induced DRG Kv1.2 down-regulation is triggered by DRG DNMT3a and whether DNMT3a regulates Kv1.2 expression and function, and neuronal excitability in DRG and contributes to neuropathic pain. In Aim 1, we will first examine whether and how DNMT3a contributes to the nerve injury-induced downregulation of Kv1.2 in the injured DRG. We will determine if Kv1.2 reduction is dependent on DNMT3a methylation and decreased Oct 1 binding. In Aim 2, we will observe whether blocking the SNL-induced increase in DRG DNMT3a alters Kv1.2 expression, total Kv current and excitability in DRG neurons and behavioral responses. The proposed studies will provide major conceptual advances in our understanding of the molecular mechanism of neuropathic pain and might open a door for developing new strategies for treating neuropathic pain."
"9314234","Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBO), which include Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), are chronic  immune-mediated conditions of the digestive system that affect an estimated 1.4 million Americans of all ages,  races and ethnicities. Time trends in both industrialized and developing countries suggest rising incidence and  prevalence worldwide. Epidemiologic data are scarce, however, in the United States, given-the lack of a  national healthcare system and of a readily available population sampling method for disease surveillance. The  conditions generally relapse and remit unpredictably with symptomatic flares that may include diarrhea,  abdominal pain, rectal bleeding, fatigue, weight loss, and a variety of complications and extra-intestinal  manifestations, including developmental effects in children. Medications are used to control symptoms and  prevent progression by diminishing inflammatory and immune responses, while surgery may be needed to  treat disease complications. The personal impact of IBO varies widely among individuals, however, and likely  reflects individual differences in disease biology, variations in the timing and choice of therapies, and disparate  psychosocial and economic characteristics. Understanding the impact of IBO on affected individuals, and the  biological, medical and psychosocial determinants of that impact, is critical if individual outcomes are to be  improved through rationally designed interventions. In addition, if a national surveillance program for IBO could  be created, disease trends in the US could be tracked, with appropriate dedication of resources to meet the  population's needs. The Crohn's & Colitis Foundation of America (CCFA) is the nation's largest non-profit  organization devoted to lBO, with robust lay and professional involvement. Through advocacy, research grants  and initiatives supported through its own fundraising efforts, and a long-standing collaboration with the CDC  through earlier U01 research cooperative agreements, the CCFA has been working to achieve an improved  understanding of the epidemiology of IBO and the basis of disease heterogeneity as a means of improving  outcomes. The overarching goal of this proposal is to identify the population health needs of  individuals afflicted with lBO, and to design and implement interventions to improve their disease  outcomes. This proposal leverages the unique assets of the CCFA to address key issues in the epidemiology  and outcomes of IBO. These include coordination and involvement of lay stakeholders; an active National  Scientific Advisory Committee with Professional Affairs and Patient Education Committees dedicated to  creating and disseminating significant interventions; a website and a variety of other avenues to channel  information to patients and providers; CCFA Partners, a novel online cohort of patients with self-reported  disease outcomes, and OSCCAR (the Ocean State Crohn's and Colitis Area Registry), a unique, community-based  prospective IBO inception cohort created through the CCFA's work with the CDC over the last 5 years."
"9349608","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The first neuroanatomical sex difference in mammals was reported in 1978, and named the sexually dimorphic nucleus (SDN) due to its larger size in males compared to females. The SDN is located within the preoptic area (POA), a region critical to copulatory and maternal behaviors. Studies of these differences in SDN volume have established that males and females generate the same number of neurons in this brain region early in development. However, the lack of estradiol in females causes neurons in the SDN to selectively die off early in life, whereas the production of estradiol from precursor androgens in males exerts a neuroprotective effect. A mechanistic explanation for the neuroprotective effects of estradiol in this system is currently unknown. Recent discoveries on the critical role of non-neuronal cells, such as microglia, in sculpting the developing brain have led us to explore the role of these cells in development of sex differences in neuronal architecture. Our lab has demonstrated that microglia are essential for the masculinization of spine density on dendrites of POA neurons, as well as male copulatory behavior. I recently discovered that the female POA contains a higher percentage of surveying phagocytic microglia than the male POA. I speculate that robust volumetric sex differences in the SDN are achieved by this higher percentage of phagocytic microglia in the female SDN. Current evidence suggests that microglia play a crucial role in phagoptosis (engulfment of stressed, but viable cells) as well as phagocytosis (engulfment of dead cells) during development. This notion, coupled with the known role of estradiol in this system, has led me to predict that estradiol suppresses microglial phagoptosis in the male SDN, rather than preventing conventional neuron-initiated apoptosis. We anticipate that microglia are the initiators of the apoptotic events in females, where there is an absence of estradiol. We have proposed the following aims to test this hypothesis: 1.1) Identify the critical period for microglial phagocytosis in the developing SDN. 1.2) Determine the impact of estradiol on microglial phagocytosis in the developing SDN 2.1) Determine the cellular targets of microglial phagocytosis in the developing SDN and 2.2) Determine the role of microglia (phagoptosis versus conventional phagocytosis) in establishing the sex difference in size of the SDN. Completion of the experiments proposed will challenge the dogma that estradiol prevents neuronal apoptosis in the male SDN; and reveal novel hormone and neuroimmune mechanisms that regulate apoptotic and neuroprotective cascades during normal brain development. Understanding these mechanisms will not only facilitate studies of sex differences in other brain regions, but may also lead to novel insights into windows of vulnerability during development. è?More specifically, perinatal hypoxic events are more frequently associated with an increased risk of brain damage in males compared to females. The results of the proposed studies will provide new information on the neuroprotective roles of immune cells and hormones, and potential sex differences in efficacy of estradiol and/or microglial inhibitors as neuroprotective agents."
"9457753","ABSTRACT Resting state networks are a fascinating yet poorly understood phenomenon. Sets of spatially separated regions show correlated slow fluctuations in fMRI BOLD signals, most obvious when subjects are at rest. These networks appear to have clinical imporantance: brain injuries perturb resting state networks, and multiple clinical disorders, including depression, dyslexia and prosopagnosia, are associated with specific resting state network abnormalities. Resting state data are used to infer functional connections between regions, but little is known about how neuronal activity gives rise to these networks. Furthermore, despite much speculation, little is known about how resting network state might influence task-related neuronal activity. Understanding the reciprocal relationships between resting state networks and neural activity has the potential to revolutionize our understanding of brain function. The reason that a gap in our knowledge exists is primarily due to the fact that it is difficult to characterize resting state networks without being within an active MRI scanner, and difficult to record spikes from neurons in such an environment (and even more difficult to record from multiple cells at once in such an environment). Alternative methods most involve serial recording of resting state networks and neuronal activity, recording of lower frequency electrical signals (LFP), or the use of optical methods in mouse which provide a close but not exact surrogate of neuronal activity (e.g., calcium signals) and access only to the uppermost layers of cortex. We propose to develop an innovative method to address this issue: high density parallel recording and oxygen polarography using carbon fiber microwires widely dispersed across the cortex of an awake behaving non-human primate. We have already demonstrated long-range correlations using oxygen polarography recorded on standard size micro-electrodes, paired with standard unit-recording electrodes. These correlations resemble resting state phenomenon, but in order to capture and relate the dynamics of neural activity to the dynamics of resting state networks, much denser spatial sampling is required."
"9475429","Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is the most common motor neuron disease in adults and has a global incidence of 1-2.6/100,000 annually. Known risk factors include age, certain genetic mutations, and male sex prior to older age. With largely unknown etiology, identifying modifiable risk factors for ALS is an important approach to minimizing the burden of this disease; however, findings have been inconsistent for environmental risk factors for ALS, such as metal, solvent, and pesticide exposure and past studies have been limited in their ability to examine the presence of genetic mutations with individual level risk factors for ALS and gene- environment interactions. Although ambient air pollutants have been examined with regard to other neurologic conditions, such as Parkinson?s disease and Alzheimer?s disease, only one study to date has explored the potential relationship with ALS. The study aims to investigate associations of environmental and occupational exposures including persistent environmental toxicants and ambient air pollutants and ALS. A case control study is proposed and will involve identification of persons with ALS from the National ALS Registry with available biorepository samples and risk factor data (cases, n=330), and recruitment of controls from the same county or state matched by age, race, and sex (n=330). The questionnaire will obtain information on sociodemographic factors, smoking history, military service history, environmental/occupational exposures (pesticides, metals, solvents), and lifetime residential and occupational history, as available. Environmental/occupational exposures (i.e., self-report and ambient air pollutants) will be examined in relation to ALS risk with verification of toxicant levels in blood samples. Residential history will be used to calculate a time weighted average exposure of PM2.5 and ozone for the period 2002-2012. Data on 35 neurotoxic air pollutants identified through the US EPA National-Scale Air Toxics Assessment (NATA) will be used to calculate average annual average residential exposure for cases and controls for available NATA years (1999, 2002, 2005, and 2011). We will measure exposures to solvents and pesticides in blood concentrations of cases (n=330) and controls (n=330) using a battery of tests for persistent environmental pollutants (organochlorine pesticides, polychlorinated biphenyls, and brominated flame retardants). This will help verify the responses for estimated exposures. Odds ratios and 95% CIs will be estimated using conditional logistic regression with adjustment for demographics, confounders, and smoking. Additionally, among ALS cases (n=330), we will examine the functional relationship between environmental toxicants in human biological samples and key biological pathways and common genes (e.g., C9ORF72, SOD1, NEK1) associated with the development and/or progression of ALS. The proposed study will be one of the first to examine blood levels of environmental toxicants and presence of genetic mutations in combination with data on environmental and occupational exposures from interview data (i.e., self-report and ambient air pollutants) in relation to ALS risk."
"9565759","Studies proposed in this application are designed to develop an understanding of the molecular and cellular basis for age-related changes in lipid metabolism that impact the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD). To achieve this goal we will use a cross-disciplinary approach that will combine unique sets of clinical data and human biospecimens together with mechanistic hypotheses testing using a mouse model of AD with a relevant targeted genetic abnormality in phospholipid metabolism. There is strong evidence that phospholipid metabo- lism is abnormal in AD brain and there are data indicating that prodromal and frank clinical AD have correlates in the blood plasma lipidome that include apparent abnormalities of the turnover of phosphatidylcholine (PC) ? a major constituent of all biological membranes, including those in neurons and glial cells. This is reflected by reduced plasma levels of certain molecular species of PC containing eicosapentaenoic- [EPA, 20:5n-3] and docosahexaenoic acid [DHA, 22:6n-3] in AD. Together, the data suggest the hypothesis that AD pathophysiol- ogy may be characterized by lipidomic abnormalities that occur early in the disease and encompass both the periphery (as reflected by plasma lipidomic changes) and the brain. However, heretofore it has not been possi- ble to address this idea directly due to the lack of an appropriately optimized scientific and clinical infrastructure that incorporates blood and brain samples. We propose to test this hypothesis by interdisciplinary approaches that will employ sets of data and biorepositories of plasma and postmortem brain tissue derived from the par- ticipants of the Framingham Heart Study (FHS) population. The FHS has epidemiology of dementia and brain donation programs (over 200 brains available), resulting in longitudinal clinical and neuropsychological data for subjects whose diagnoses range from cognitively intact to mild cognitive impairment to dementia. The neuro- pathological diagnoses of these subjects range from normal to advanced AD. The FHS has food frequency questionnaire data and has collected plasma samples longitudinally over time from these subjects, making it an optimal resource to identify abnormalities in the metabolism of lipids, associated with cognitive impairment and AD pathology, that may serve as biomarkers and targets for therapy. The polyunsaturated species of PC (such as PC-DHA) are primarily synthesized by the enzyme phosphatidylethanolamine N-methyltransferase (PEMT). PEMT abnormalities reduce plasma PC-DHA concentrations in humans and have been associated with increased risk of AD. Therefore, abnormal PEMT activity may contribute to AD pathophysiology. We pro- pose the following aims: 1) To identify lipidomic- and PEMT activity changes associated with age and AD de- velopment in brain tissue; 2) To determine lipidomic profiles of serial, stored plasma samples obtained in life from the above subjects, and correlate the plasma lipidomic data with the information obtained in Aim 1 and 3) To determine the effect of PEMT activity and PC-DHA levels on the development of AD-like pathology in AD model mice with 2, 1, or 0 copies of the Pemt gene, for mechanistic hypothesis testing."

"9436363","Recent molecular studies reveal global chromatin disorganization in glioblastoma (GBM), but how that affects individual gene loci to drive tumor growth and migration in vivo is still poorly understood. Previously, we have shown remarkable similarities in chromatin remodeling between germinal matrix stem/progenitors (NSPCs) and gliomas at the EGFR promoter, and implicated several epigenetic modifiers for the transcriptional activation of this oncogenic locus (Erfani et al, 2015). We now expand our study focus to investigate more systematically and in functionally distinct populations how developmentally regulated transcriptional networks become pathologically co-opted in gliomas to maintain tumorigenic properties of cell migration and cell proliferation. To this end, we have developed a simple EGF ligand-binding strategy to prospectively isolate populations with stem cell properties from fresh human samples and patient-derived glioma xenografts (PDX), in which the migratory human GBM cells can be regionally separated from those at the tumor core (Tome- Garcia et al, Stem Cell Rep, accepted in final revisions). Full transcriptome and chromatin accessibility analyses in these freshly sorted human GBM stem cell populations revealed distinct regulatory regions related to cell migration vs. self-renewal, the latter also present in NSPCs. We thus hypothesized that tumor properties of cell growth and migration in GBM are regulated through unique transcription factors (TFs) at regions of open chromatin, some of which are co-opted from a normal neural developmental state. To test this hypothesis, here we intend to profile the transcriptome (by RNA-seq) and associated open chromatin landscape (by ATAC-seq) in phenotypically defined migratory vs. core-proliferative human GBM populations, isolated from PDX gliomas, and compare them to our previously generated data in developing NSPCs. Differential analysis of RNAseq and ATACseq data in infiltrative vs. tumor-core GBM cells will allow us to define the transcriptional pathways and chromatin accessibility regulatory regions driving adaptations for a migratory GBM cell fate in vivo, while comparative analysis with similar data in NSPCs will elucidate how developmental pathways are aberrantly co- opted and re-activated in GBM. Combined ATACseq/RNAseq data analysis will provide a blueprint for specific TF binding occupancy at gene loci activated in infiltrative tumor cells, generating a candidate list of TF regulators for cell migration in GBM, which we will confirm biochemically. Defining the specific epigenetic landscape and associated transcriptional phenotype in neoplastic and progenitor populations derived from fresh human and PDX samples will advance deeply our understanding of the mechanisms maintaining plasticity in GBM stem cells and the specific molecular adaptations in a subset of these cells towards a migratory cell fate. By depositing our data in an open access platform, we will maximize data dissemination and facilitate further investigation into the role of cell migration in GBM, hoping to uncover new avenues for therapy aimed at targeting infiltrative tumor cells that currently evade surgical resection."
"9565885","Project Summary/ Abstract The loss of motor function that occurs with aging is closely associated with adverse health outcomes. To date, the contribution of different components of the motor system to age-related motor deficits remains unknown and despite extensive efforts. In addition, there are no therapeutics that can prevent the cellular and molecular changes that underlie loss of motor function with aging. The purpose of this proposal is to identify the contribution of the neuromuscular system to loss of motor function. We also seek to identify and test factors that function to maintain healthy skeletal muscles and motor neurons in the spinal cord, and thus preserve motor function. Specifically, we will determine whether maintaining normal levels of acetylcholine, genetically and pharmacologically, is sufficient to slow aging of skeletal muscle and motor neurons."

"9313523","Project Title: Detection of microsatellite instability biomarkers for therapeutic clinical trial eligibility Project Summary When enrolling patients with advanced cancer in clinical trials, there is a need for clinical grade diagnostics to detect predictive biomarkers for novel immunotherapies. Microsatellite instability (MSI) has been identified as a novel predictive biomarker for cancer immunotherapy. Detecting MSI is currently accomplished with multiple redundant assays including immunohistochemistry for four proteins in the DNA repair pathway (MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, PMS2) and PCR for five selected microsatellite positions on finite tumor specimens (2). These diagnostic tests have been optimized for patients with colorectal cancer suspected of having germline Lynch Syndrome. Unfortunately, these assays oftentimes exhaust finite clinical specimens. The use of next generation sequencing (NGS)-based tests has expanded the profile of molecular diagnostics and raises the potential to integrate detection of MSI and eliminate the requirement for multiple parallel tests. While patients undergo genomic testing for other types of mutations such as point mutations, there is a critical need to augment current assays to include detection of microsatellite instability given its predictive value. Furthermore, current microsatellite detection algorithms have been specifically developed for a small number of cancer types and therefore are not accurate for MSI testing in most cancers. Our Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA)--compliant Cancer Genomics Lab has extensive experience in developing clinical grade tumor sequencing, bioinformatics, and mutation-driven trials (3-6). We hypothesize that targeted DNA sequencing and analysis enables the detection of microsatellite instability in patient specimens from diverse cancer types. During the UH2 Phase of Analytic Validation, we will determine the sensitivity, specificity, reproducibility and reportable ranges of a targeted DNA microsatellite sequencing assay, MSI-Dx, utilizing clinical tumor specimens (Aim 1). We will demonstrate scalability, rapid turnaround, and use of MSI-Dx on a desktop sequencer. During the UH3 Phase of Clinical Validation, the MSI-Dx assay will be applied on a diverse collection of samples comprised of known MSI-H tumors including colorectal, endometrial, and other cancer types (Aim 2). Further, we will utilize the MSI-Dx assay for patients enrolled in a real time clinical tumor sequencing study (Aim 3). Importantly, MSI-Dx can be integrated with other NGS-based testing strategies. This assay will have a broad therapeutic impact by facilitating precision medicine clinical trials for patients with MSI-H tumors."
"9354181","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Insulin resistance (IR) is a state of metabolic dysfunction that precedes Type II diabetes (T2D) and cardiovascular disease. IR is characterized by an impaired ability of insulin to promote plasma glucose disposal into insulin-sensitive tissue, the majority of which is skeletal muscle (SkM). Before insulin can stimulate muscle glucose uptake (MGU), it must first be physically transported from the plasma, across the continuous endothelium of SkM capillaries and into the interstitial fluid that bathes myocytes. In fact, the ability of insulin to stimulate MGU depends on the rate at which insulin crosses the capillary endothelium. Furthermore, preliminary data from our laboratory and others have demonstrated that insulin transport across the endothelium is impaired in the insulin resistant state. Despite the importance of insulin transport to insulin action, the mechanism of endothelial insulin transport and its long-term regulation in vivo are poorly understood. This proposal will focus on two Specific Aims to define the mechanisms that regulate insulin transport in vivo. These Specific Aims will test the hypotheses that (1) endothelial insulin transport is an active process that requires caveolar vesicles and the insulin receptor and (2) obesity-induced defects in insulin transport are rescued by exercise training through a nitric oxide(NO)-dependent mechanism. To study insulin transport in vivo, I have developed a highly innovative imaging technique to measure capillary permeability to a fluorescent insulin probe in live mice. This technique will be combined with conditional, endothelial-specific genetic modifications in mice to delineate the role of caveolin-1, the insulin receptor, and NO to insulin transport. The effects of these manipulations on SkM insulin sensitivity will be assessed using hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamps with isotopic glucose tracers in conscious, unstressed mice. The proposed studies will elucidate the mechanisms by which insulin transport is regulated acutely and in response to chronic stimuli (obesity and exercise). The results of these studies will improve the prospect of developing therapeutic strategies that target the vasculature and SkM insulin delivery in the treatment of T2D."
"9396046","Large-scale genetic data has become increasingly available, providing many clues about the genetic basis of human traits and diseases. However, ~90% of genome-wide association study (GWAS) signals are from common, noncoding variants. Such variants are difficult to interpret and connect to biological insight because (1) there are generally multiple possible causal genes at each locus and (2) linking noncoding variants to the genes they regulate is challenging, which obscures the biological processes involved. Many strategies for mitigating this problem have been proposed. One such strategy is applying algorithms that look for commonalities across loci, which can implicate biological processes through gene set enrichment analysis, pinpoint important epigenetic marks, and/or prioritize likely causal genes. A second strategy is assaying rare and low-frequency coding variants, which have less linkage disequilibrium and therefore more directly pinpoint causal genes. To facilitate progress from genetic association to biological hypotheses, I propose extending and combining these strategies to develop several different methods. Specifically, I will take DEPICT, a gene set enrichment analysis method developed by our lab for GWAS data, and adapt it for use with the ExomeChip (which genotypes coding rare- and low-frequency variants). DEPICT has the particular advantage of using gene sets that have been extended via coexpression data to make predictions about the function of uncharacterized genes, so it is especially powerful as a tool for biological interpretation. DEPICT also prioritizes causal genes for GWAS based on the similarity of their gene set memberships. However, many other methods for prioritization have been developed and it is difficult to know which are the most accurate. I will therefore develop a method for rigorous comparison of existing prioritization strategies and use it to determine which are the most effective. Finally, interpretation of whole-genome sequencing data is hampered by the challenge of linking noncoding variants to genes and the large sample sizes needed to achieve sufficient power to detect associations. I will develop a gene-set-based approach that incorporates epigenetic information and will use it to improve power for detection of rare and low-frequency noncoding variation in anthropometric traits. Completion of this project will result in a number of useful tools for extracting biological insight from genetic association data that draw on the advantages of gene set enrichment analysis and the power of focusing on rare- and low-frequency variation."
"9482281","ABSTRACT: INVESTIGATOR DEVELOPMENT CORE Pilot projects are a critical step in the research process. They provide information on the likely success of study methods, the burden to participants, and the time and resources needed to complete specific tasks. However, early stage investigators often have little training in effective research processes. As a result, the pilot funding period may end before all pilot project tasks have been completed. In our previous work, we established a Research Consult Service to assist investigators in refining research questions and methods, obtaining funding, addressing challenges in completing research tasks, and interpreting and disseminating findings. We developed and published a conceptual framework to guide the work of this Consult Service. The framework envisions assistance as progressing through sequential phases that involve publicizing availability, determining needs, providing assistance, referring to outside resources when necessary, monitoring progress, and evaluating outcomes. We also established a Community-Based Research Network (CBRN) consisting of community organizations working on collaborative research projects that are relevant to their organizations. We now propose to use the Research Consult Service, conceptual framework, and CBRN to develop and manage a pilot project program that is consistent with and synergistic to the theme of our proposed NIMHD Center of Excellence, i.e. involving communities in delivering and disseminating health disparity interventions. Specifically, we will i) publicize the availability of pilot grants; ii) help early stage investigators develop competitive applications; iii) utilize an online system for submission and rigorous review of applications; and iv) provide assistance, oversight, and evaluation to awardees. This pilot project program will focus on our institution's post-doctoral fellows, junior faculty, and early stage investigators, particularly those from underrepresented groups in order to develop a diverse workforce for conducting health disparities research. Both our Research Consult Service and our CBRN will meet regularly with awardees, provide assistance in completing project tasks, monitor progress, create innovative learning opportunities, and help them prepare for subsequent projects and grant applications. Awardees will also be active participants in other research, educational, and dissemination activities organized by the Center of Excellence. This pilot project program will develop investigators with a high capacity to engage in partnerships with communities, will expand the scientific workforce in the thematic focus area of the Center of Excellence, and will contribute to best practices on assisting early stage investigators to successfully complete pilot projects."
"9565756","ABSTRACT  Every human has a body burden of endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs), and levels of EDCs correlate with reproductive, endocrine, and neurobehavioral deficiencies. As environmental stressors, EDCs interact with other types of stressors to increase chronic disease and impair the quality of life. This proposal seeks to understand how the developmental trajectory of an individual is shaped by the interaction of behavioral stress during two life stages in the context of contamination. We focus on the social behavioral phenotype, as shifts in the reaction norms of social behavior can profoundly change an individual?s relationship to its community, his/her reproductive success, and mental health. We postulate that neurodevelopment in a contaminated world changes an individual?s baseline social phenotype, and that further life stressors overlaid upon the EDC phenotype create greater deflections from the behavioral norm. We will approach this question in several novel ways. First, we will model constant low-level exposure to a mixture of common-use EDCs throughout life, and assess emotional reactivity and sociality. Second, we will examine the effects of a typical life challenge (mild stress) during two critical life periods: to the mother (during pregnancy), to the individual during adolescence, or both. Third, we will compare males and females; this enables us to identify susceptibilities that may relate to well-established gender differences in disease and neurobehavioral dysfunction. Finally, by measuring changes in neuromolecular activity and neuroanatomical organization in a defined network of interconnected limbic and forebrain nuclei regulating the social phenotype, we can gain mechanistic insights into these processes. Thus, our overarching hypothesis is that each life stressor (lifelong EDC exposures, mild prenatal stress, and mild stress during adolescence) concatenates to shift the reaction norms for neurodevelopment and social behavior, and that the combination of stressors exacerbates adverse outcomes for neurobiological health. Mechanistically, we further propose that EDCs and stressors modulate this phenotype through perturbing the normal complementarity of estrogen and androgen signaling in the social decision-making network of the brain. There are 3 Specific Aims. Aim I will establish the sexually dimorphic behavioral phenotype of a lifetime of exposure to low levels of a mixture of common-use EDCs, upon which is superimposed mild stress during critical life stages (gestational, adolescent, or both). Aim II will determine underlying neuromolecular mechanisms for the changes caused by lifelong EDC exposures and gestational/adolescent stressors, focusing on estrogen/androgen-sensitive circuits. Aim III will identify neuroanatomical and cytoarchitectural substrates for the changes caused by EDCs and stressors, prioritizing estrogen-androgen signaling pathways. Proposed work has the potential to have a broad impact, ranging from societal and government policies, the health crisis caused by increasing chronic disease, and understanding fundamental biological principles at the molecular, cellular and organismal levels."
"9432389","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The disparities in suicidal behavior among American teenagers, particularly girls, have been documented now for over two decades. Since 1991, CDC surveys consistently show that adolescent Latinas attempt suicide at rates much higher than any other group of American adolescents. Even with three decades of surveys, no studies have systematically compared Latinas to other girls in order to understand the reasons Latinas? propensity to suicidal behavior. While family dynamics often account for the suicide attempts of adolescents, we do not know what the qualitative differences in Hispanic family dynamics that influence daughters to attempt suicide more than peers. What, if any, are the substantive differences with non-Hispanic peers? The overarching goal of this developmental/exploratory application is to deepen knowledge of the higher likelihood of Latinas toward suicide attempts (SAs) in contrast to non-Hispanic peers. We will examine the influence of family dynamics on suicidal behavior among Latinas, and contrast the reports of Latinas with those of non-Latina attempters. This study examines intensively family functioning of female suicide attempters of Latino, non-Hispanic White, and African American cultural heritage using in-depth interviews with the girls and the primary female caregiver. Twenty adolescent-caregiver dyads in racial/ethnic groups will be recruited to address two aims: (1) explore the psychological vulnerability of teenage suicide attempters in three racial/ethnic groups and the life contexts that influenced suicidal behaviors. Data on individual susceptibility, viz., emotional vulnerability, family factors, and life context, that girls in each racial/ethnic group indicate influenced the suicide attempts, including thoughts, meanings, and interpretations will generate testable hypotheses about underlying reasons that increase Latina teens? propensity to suicidal behaviors and why they choose this action; and (2) describe the life histories and trajectories of family dynamics that influenced the attempt for each racial/ethnic group. We will seek answers to such questions as, What are family-adolescent dynamics that shaped the suicidal behavior for each group? To what extent do Latinas? and caregivers? histories and trajectories differ from those of the two other racial/ethnic groups? This aim identifies variations in patterns of family dynamics and sociocultural elements that reveal differences in manifestations of suicide attempts across racial/ethnic groups. Achieving these two aims via this mechanism can set the stage for a larger study and inform preventive and intervention programs."
"9482052","Project Summary: An estimated 50% of HIV+ patients still exhibits central nervous system (CNS) viral infection, with 30% of patients progressing to some form of HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND) despite combined anti- retroviral therapy (cART). In the previously funded NIH R01 (NS063897-01A2) project ? Viral evolution in peripheral macrophages and brain during progression to AIDS ? we used the SIV-infected macaque model of neuroAIDS to show that in untreated animals SIV can enter the CNS multiple times, as early as 10 days post infection, throughout the course of the disease. SIV subpopulations infecting the brain are evolutionarily related to viral strains infecting myeloid cells in peripheral tissues, such as bone marrow and lung, which accumulate in the meninges and choroid plexus in early infection, and in the perivascular space and SIV-associated encephalitis (SIVE) lesions in late infection. Moreover, we found evidence that ongoing evolution in peripheral tissues leads, late in infection, to the emergence of viral lineages adapted to enter and replicate in the CNS microenvironment that may be linked to SIVE onset. However, the impact of cART on the timing and mode of entry of virus into the CNS has yet to be analyzed, which is crucial to explain why HAND is present even in virally suppressed patients. The present proposal for a competitive renewal seeks to extend the studies of the original project by characterizing the evolutionary behavior of the virus leading up to CNS infection and subsequent regulation of CNS-specific viral and host genes expression in the presence of cART. We seek to evaluate, in particular, peripheral blood monocytes and monocyte/macrophage rich tissues as potential source of CNS virus during cART, and the contribution of persisting CNS (and peripheral tissues) virus to viral rebound after therapy interruption. Two specific aims are proposed: Specific Aim 1 ? Determine the impact of early cART on viral evolutionary patterns, as well as viral and host gene expression patterns, associated with viral entry and replication in the CNS of SIV-infected rhesus macaques; Specific Aim 2 ? Determine relative contribution of SIV-infected macrophage subsets in the CNS and peripheral tissues to low-level viremia during cART and viral rebound following cART interruption. The elucidation of viral evolutionary patterns and the contribution of specific infected tissues/cell populations to CNS infection, in the presence or subsequent absence of cART, would be highly beneficial to future studies designed to adjust current therapeutic strategies toward the prevention and elimination of neuroAIDS, and formation of the CNS reservoir, which is a necessary step for the development of an HIV cure."
"9393235","Combination interventions to reduce disparities in HIV infection for transgender women (TW) who have sex with men are sorely needed, as this population is one of the highest risk and most underserved groups in the United States. The goal of this proposed research project is to evaluate a locally developed and potentially effective intervention, the TransLife Center (TLC), which provides combination (i.e., biomedical, behavioral, social/structural) HIV prevention services to adult TW at high risk for HIV infection, in a culturally specific and highly accessible affirming environment. The TLC intervention directly addresses the structural barriers to health promotion among TW through a coordinated screening and service model, including direct access to services most needed and requested by TW: employment, housing, legal, and health services, following a social determinants of health conceptual model. To date there are no evidence-based HIV prevention interventions (EBIs) for TW listed in the CDC compendium of EBIs. The proposed study will address this gap through collaboration between Chicago House and Social Service Agency (Chicago House), a long-standing HIV/AIDS service provider and HIV prevention researchers who have been actively engaged in the development of HIV prevention interventions for TW. Our experience suggests that Chicago House's TLC intervention is feasible and acceptable to the target population, with over 200 HIV-uninfected TW participating in services over the past three years and evidence suggesting potential efficacy of the intervention for both sexual risk reduction and health promotion. We propose to test the TLC intervention in a single arm trial among 100 HIV-uninfected and sexually active TW, ages 18 and older, and evaluate intervention effectiveness over a 12-month period with visits at 6-month intervals (baseline, 6-months, 12-months). All participants will receive standard-of-care HIV/STI prevention and testing services, assessment and linkage to pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), as indicated. We will evaluate the TLC intervention via the following aims: AIM 1) To determine the pre-post efficacy of the TLC intervention on the primary outcome: number of condomless anal sex acts without protection by PrEP. 1a) To assess the dose response relationship between intervention exposure as well as exposure to specific components (i.e., employment, housing, legal, and health) on reductions in the primary outcome. 1b) To assess mediation of intervention effects on protective processes (gender affirmation, collective self-esteem, social support) theorized to increase with intervention exposure; AIM 2) To examine intervention implementation experiences through semi-structured interviews with 20 TLC participants and 10 Chicago House staff members. AIM 3) Exploratory Aims: 3a) To describe the trajectory of PrEP indication, uptake, retention and adherence in the community-based sample over a 12-month follow-up period and evaluate the impact of the TLC intervention on the PrEP continuum of care. 3b) To explore whether reductions in HIV risk are associated with epidemiologically-linked moderators including age and race/ethnicity.  "
"9402467","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Crohn?s disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), also known as the inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), are characterized by chronic relapsing inflammation of the digestive tract. Although diagnostics and treatments of IBD have improved over the years, patients with IBD still have a much lower quality-of-life than healthy individuals. During the course of this past decade, the medical researchers leading the proposed project, along with their colleagues that make up the NIDDK IBD Genetics Consortium and in collaboration with their international collaborators, have identified 200 regions in the human genome that influence a person?s chances of developing CD or UC ? either increasing or decreasing their chances. Each one of these regions contains zero, one or multiple genes, and hundreds of variations in the genetic code (the genetic code is slightly different from one individual to the next). As part of this project, the researchers will recruit patients and healthy controls, collect biosamples and clinical data that will be part of the NIDDK Central Repositories (in an anonymous fashion to protect participants). The researchers of the proposed project, the NIDDK IBD Genetics Consortium members, and any other qualified researcher will use these samples and data for the discovery of additional risk factors for IBD. The researchers of the proposed project will determine the biological mechanisms by which some these specific changes in the genetic code influence the balance between health and disease (in this case CD or UC), and potentially identify molecules in the blood that can be used as clinical markers of disease, disease subtypes and inflammation status. The objective is to identify the root causes of disease, so that we reveal the key targets for more precise and effective therapies for CD and UC in order to improve the quality of life of patients with CD and UC and eventually lead to the cure of these otherwise lifelong debilitating diseases."
"9366875","Project Summary: Endothelin B (ETB) receptors have been shown to be elevated in various ocular tissues in animal models of glaucoma. Our preliminary data suggest that ETA receptors are also increased in retinas of rats with elevated IOP. Previous work from our laboratory showed that many of the deleterious effects of ocular hypertension including optic nerve axonal injury and retinal ganglion cell (RGC) loss are attenuated in ETB receptor-deficient rats. This suggests a causative role of ETB receptors in neurodegeneration. However, the mechanisms underlying endothelin mediated neurodegeneration of the optic nerve and RGCs are not understood. The main hypothesis that antagonism of the endothelin receptors promotes neuroprotection by attenuating the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38 MAP kinase pathway during ocular hypertension. The current grant application will comprise of the following specific aims: 1) Determine if the endothelin receptors mediate neurodegeneration of RGCs and their axons by activating c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38 MAP kinase signaling pathways in rodents. 2) Elucidate the signaling mechanisms involved in endothelin mediated apoptosis of cultured primary retinal ganglion cells. 3) Investigate if endothelin receptor antagonism is neuroprotective in a rodent model of ocular hypertension. The highlights of this project include a gene therapy intervention using adeno-associated viral knock down of ETA as well as the ETB receptor to determine its neuroprotective effects during ocular hypertension in rats. Another approach proposed in the grant is the use of endothelin receptor antagonists to block endothelin receptors and promote neuroprotection in IOP elevated rats. The project will assess the contribution of endothelin receptors to neurodegeneration and delineate the role of the JNK and p38 MAP kinase pathway in endothelin receptor-mediated neurodegeneration during ocular hypertension in rats. The project will also generate possibilities for molecular as well as pharmacological interventions to block endothelin receptors thereby promote neuroprotection of RGCs and their axons. The basic information gained from these studies would facilitate development of neuroprotective agents for treatment of glaucoma."
"9483169","Abstract Many cancer types including pancreatic cancer have very high mortality rates because it is difficult to detect their presence in the early stage. Current biomarkers for pancreatic cancer such as serum CA-19-9 protein face high false positive and negative rates. The proposed studies seek to develop a robust and user-friendly novel molecular beacon and lipoplex nanoparticle biochip technology and validate its clinic potential by detecting Glypican 1 mRNA and protein in extracellular vesicles from pancreatic cancer patient serum samples for imminent use in the field of early cancer diagnosis. The specific aims of this project are: Aim 1: Development of Robust Biochip Technology. 1-1. Improved MBs for high stability and mis-match specificity; 1-2. Standard vesicles (SVs) for chip and analyzer calibration and analytical quantification; 1-3. Non-TIRF fluorescence microscope as a low-cost analyzer and automated software module for fast and user-friendly image acquisition and analysis. Specific Aim 2: Multi-site Technology Validation for Pancreatic Cancer Diagnosis. 2-1. Comparison with qRT-PCR, NGS and ELISA for performance, cost, assay time, and user friendliness. 2-2. Multi-site blind validation: Lab-to-lab repeatability and blind validation comparison at OSU and MSKCC using patient and normal donor serum samples."
"9566411","ABSTRACT Pneumonia and its complication of post-discharge disability are increasingly common and survivable. Treatment has had important advances in the last decade. Yet it has also become clear that pneumonia is often life-altering for patients who survive. Many survivors develop new long-term disability and cognitive impairment, at least among older survivors. Unfortunately, we have few interventions to improve these problems. While we have learned that post-discharge disability after pneumonia is an important public health problem, we have little empirical data on the trajectories of recovery for patients. We propose to address this problem through a collaboration from two research teams (the University of Michigan, including the Institute for Social Research, and the Kaiser Permanente Division of Research's Systems Research Initiative) and do so in a community setting. Kaiser Permanente Northern California is an integrated healthcare delivery system with comprehensive electronic records. Starting with an explicit goal of defining patient trajectories, we will follow a community-based inception cohort of 1,232 patients with pneumonia with 868 completing follow up. This cohort will be interviewed within 1 week of hospital discharge and again at 1½, 3, 4½, 6, 9, and 12 months after hospital discharge with a focused phone survey to assess post-discharge disability. Frequent brief interviews will provide the first disease-specific trajectory measurements for patients with the common condition of pneumonia. Our Aims are:  Aim 1: We will quantify archetypical trajectories of recovery or disability in the year after pneumonia using  advanced statistical methods to understand what are the common trajectories, and what modifies those  trajectories?characteristics of the patient, of the pneumonia hospitalization, and recurrent hospitalizations.  Aim 2: We will identify testable `Recipes for Success' to understand how do some patients beat the odds  and experience a substantially faster recovery using detailed in person testing and interviews with patients  identified as doing far better than would have been expected based on their hospitalizations and prior life. This proposal is significant in that it addresses a large but understudied public health problem and will inform translational clinical trials, basic biological research, clinical practice, and public policy about readmissions. It is innovative in its conceptualization of recovery from pneumonia as a trajectory over time requiring high- resolution quantitative mapping with frequent surveys in order to be appropriately understood. Further, it innovatively combines detailed physiologic and health services data with repeated surveys to map the patient experience; uses innovative statistical methods to quantitatively define trajectories of recovery; focuses on the full age-range of a diverse, community-based sample; and unites a multi-disciplinary team's varied expertise."

Analysis will focus on descriptive measures of disease prevalence and patient characteristics associated with various infections.        The second study will focus on evaluation of the impact of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine by    enrolling approximately 500 children evenly distributed from 0 to 5 years of age and collecting    nasopharyngeal specimens to be tested via isolation and conventional serotyping methods at the National Public Health Reference lab in Port-au-Prince.        The third study will assess the determinants of HIV mortality through two rounds, retrospective    and prospective. The target population will be HIV positive adults of both sexes aged 18 years seen at 15 health institutions from 2005-2009 and the study will compare the survival of ARV-treated versus PLHIV that did not receive treatment.        The fourth study will focus on early treatment of PLHIV compared to the standard of care (after CD4 determination. Patients in the test and treat arm will receive treatment within a week of diagnosis concurrent with the pretreatment preparation counseling. The standard of care arm will receive treatment as per current practice (when CD4 <350 and after, pretreatment counseling). All participants will be tested periodically for VL and drug resistance when suppression is not reached (VL > 1000). The primary outcome of the study will be viral load (VL) suppression at 12 months after initiation of therapy.        Outcomes will be measured for a period of 5 years."
"9419088","Project Summary This study aims to leverage the power of behavioral economics with electronic health record technology to promote appropriate diabetes care for older adults. Despite a variety of efforts, inappropriate care persists. The ABIM Foundation?s Choosing Wisely Campaign identifies focus areas for improvement; one of ten Choosing Wisely initiatives chosen by the American Geriatrics Society promotes less aggressive glycemic targets and limited pharmacologic therapy for older adults with diabetes. Changing provider behavior, however, is challenging, and existing information-based approaches fall short. Novel concepts from behavioral economics, a field that blends insights from economics and psychology to recognize that humans make predictable decision errors, have shown promise in a variety of healthcare settings. Incorporating such approaches within the electronic health record (EHR) will allow seamless integration into clinical workflow with minimal additional cognitive burden, and provide a mechanism for widespread scaling of effective interventions. We propose to develop a behavioral economics-based EHR module to promote appropriate clinical care of older adults with diabetes. Specific aims include: 1) To develop a scalable, EHR customization toolkit that leverages behavioral economic insights (the BE-EHR module) to promote appropriate diabetes care in older adults based on the American Geriatric Society?s Choosing Wisely guideline. We will implement a user-centered design process to incorporate behavioral economic approaches into existing clinical decision support tools and clinical workflows to design, iteratively refine, and usability test the new module. 2) To pilot test the new BE-EHR module?s feasibility and acceptability and generate preliminary estimates of clinician compliance with the Choosing Wisely guideline. We will conduct a 6-month, single-arm pilot study of the BE- EHR module in 4 outpatient primary care and/or geriatrics clinics to measure utilization and feasibility, and to estimate its impact on appropriate care delivery. 3) To test the ability of the BE-EHR module to reduce inappropriate diabetes treatment among older adults. We will conduct an 18-month, rigorous, pragmatic, cluster-randomized, controlled trial in 70 sites within the NYU Langone Medical Center ambulatory network to determine the BE-EHR module?s impact on appropriate diabetes care among older adults. This proposal combines a unique, experienced multi-disciplinary team with a ground-breaking approach to improve the care of older Americans with diabetes."
"9331319","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): FHI 360, a global nonprofit organization, and the YMCA of the USA propose to conduct an evaluation study of CDC's Heads Up Initiative in Youth Sports. Specifically, the FHI 360 study team will promote Heads Up materials designed for coaches of youth sports, parents, and youth athletes in local YMCA facilities across the country to assess changes in concussion prevention and treatment awareness knowledge, attitudes, intentions, and behaviors. In addition, administrators of YMCA chapters will be interviewed to collect data on sports policies and practices, to assess any changes from the use of the materials. YMCA facilities will be randomized to receive promotion efforts and distribution of the materials, or a delayed promotion. Study subjects from the two groups of facilities will be compared. FHI 360 and the YMCA of the USA expect that this evaluation study will provide much needed information about how local youth sports leagues prevent and treat concussion, as well as how well Heads Up materials communicate needed information. The study also will provide actionable findings for the YMCA of the USA to use to further promote policies and practices for concussion prevention."
"9208558","Proposed Approach: We will develop a novel 24-state cohort of injured children presenting to emergency departments (EDs) over an 8-year period. We will then use this research data resource and an inter- disciplinary team to describe and evaluate the value of ?pediatric readiness? in the emergency care of injured children. Importance: Unintentional injury remains the leading cause of death and years of potential life lost in children. Use of emergency services following injury is common, with large variability in the readiness to care for injured children. While several national and state efforts have sought to improve pediatric readiness, it remains unclear whether increased readiness improves quality and health outcomes, and at what cost. This project seeks to build a unique data resource for the scientific community and to use this resource and an inter-disciplinary team to rigorously evaluate the emergency care system for injured children in terms of quality, outcomes and costs. This project will fill key scientific gaps in pediatric trauma care and seeks to identify a re-engineered, high-value emergency care system for injured children that optimizes quality, outcomes and costs. Objectives: The proposal has 3 specific aims: Specific Aim 1. To build a novel 24-state research data resource and use these data to describe and quantify the emergency care of injured children in the context of pediatric readiness, including out-of-hospital, ED and inpatient care. Specific Aim 2. To evaluate how pediatric readiness affects the quality of care, health outcomes and costs of care for injured children. Specific Aim 3. To assess the value of pediatric readiness in the emergency care of injured children, including the balance of quality, outcomes and costs. Study Design: This will be a cohort analysis of a 24-state, population-based cohort of injured children presenting to 2,280 EDs in 24 states. Nine unique data sources will be matched at the patient level to create the master dataset. ?Pediatric readiness? will be defined using a variety of EMS, ED and hospital measures. Setting: The setting includes 2,280 hospitals in 24 states, representing diverse facilities, geographic regions, patient demographics, pediatric readiness and systems of care. Participants: The study will enroll 21.6 million injured children 0 ? 19 years presenting to 2,280 EDs following an injury event from 1/1/2012 through 12/31/2019, representing the entire denominator of injured children seeking emergency services in these states. The cohort will include 541,096 children with serious injuries (Injury Severity Score ? 16), representing high-risk patients. Outcome measures: We will evaluate 12 pediatric trauma quality measures, 2 patient-centered outcomes and acute care costs."
"9377473","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Circulating sex hormones, particularly estrogens, provide neuroprotective effects in the hippocampus to promote synaptic plasticity and verbal/spatial memory throughout adulthood. For women, these effects are lost with the cessation of ovarian estrogen synthesis at menopause, compounding age-related hippocampal neurodegeneration and cognitive decline(6, 7). Furthermore, these neurological changes increase a woman's susceptibility to develop age-related disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD)(8, 9). No hormone therapy exists to maintain cognitive function during menopause. Only short-term use of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) is FDA recommended for the management of menopausal symptoms because estrogens in HRT can increase carcinogenic proliferation of breast and uterine tissue and increase cardiovascular disease risk in older women(21-26). These adverse health risks preclude current formulations of HRT from becoming a long- term treatment for preventing hippocampal decline following ovarian estrogen loss. While both estrogen receptors ? and ? (ER?) have been associated with estrogen-mediated neuroprotection and memory following loss of ovarian estrogen, the ER-expressing cell-type mediating these functions is unknown, and the estrogen-regulated gene network has not been characterized at the cell-specific level. We have recently identified estriol, a clinically safe alternative to estrogens in HRT(23-26, 30, 31), as protective for hippocampal synaptic plasticity and spatial memory following loss of ovarian estrogen in a rodent ovariectomy (OVX) model. We hypothesize that estriol treatment is sufficient to maintain hippocampal plasticity and function following the loss of ovarian estrogen, and that these peripheral estrogen effects are mediated primarily by ER? expressed on neurons through the regulation of synapse-associated, cytoskeletal, and survival genes. We will characterize estriol-mediated neuroprotection in the hippocampus using behavioral, electrophysiological, and neuropathological outcome measures in adult and middle-aged OVX mice. Furthermore, we will determine the cell-type and the ER responsible for mediating this effect using ER- conditional knockout mice generated in our lab. Finally, we will characterize the estrogen-sensitive transcriptome of hippocampal neurons in adult and middle-aged mice. This work is significant because it will evaluate a treatment with high clinical relevance specifically for cognitive decline during menopause, use innovative conditional knockout models to reveal the cellular and molecular targets of the protective effects of estrogen in the hippocampus, and identify gene expression changes in adult and middle-aged mice to help characterize the estrogen-sensitive gene network in hippocampal neurons occurring during both surgical/early menopause and natural menopause. It will also warrant clinical trials of estriol to prevent cognitive decline from menopause. Together, this proposal supports the National Institute on Aging mission to explore research questions that significantly contribute to informed decision-making for relieving menopausal symptoms."
"9565802","Our long-term goal is to understand molecular mechanisms involved in circadian regulation of lipid metabolism and atherosclerosis and to find out how perturbations in this regulation contribute to atherosclerosis. During the previous study, we showed that mutant Clock enhances atherosclerosis by increasing cholesterol absorption in the intestine, augmenting uptake of modified lipoproteins by macrophages, and reducing cholesterol efflux from macrophages. Mechanistic studies revealed that Clock, a critical component of the circadian regulatory loop, controls diurnal regulation of MTP in the intestine and liver via Shp as well as the regulation of ATP binding cassette protein family A member 1 (ABCA1) expression in macrophages by modulating USF2 expression. As the central circadian pacemaker and regulator in peripheral tissues, the Clock:Bmal1 heterodimer has been shown to act as a metabolic sensor that directly links circadian rhythms to lipid metabolism and homeostasis. The overall goal of this proposal is to determine the underlying physiology and molecular mechanisms through which the transcription factor Bmal1 regulates cholesterol efflux from macrophages and development of atherosclerosis. Hence, we hypothesize that Bmal1 is expressed in a circadian manner in macrophages and drives rhythmic expression of genes involved in cholesterol efflux and reverse cholesterol transport (RCT) to impact atherogenesis. The two aims to be investigated in this project are: One is to investigate the impact of global (Bmal1-/-) or macrophage-specific ablation (M- Bmal1-/-) on the progression of atherosclerosis in Apoe-/- background mice fed chow or Western diets. We will then to elucidate the physiological mechanisms (such as cholesterol efflux, RCT, and bone marrow transplant) controlled by macrophage Bmal1 that are critical in atherogenesis. Two is to explore molecular mechanisms involved in regulating cholesterol efflux by macrophage Bmal1. Our approach will be to ablate Bmal1 expression in tissue culture and then to compare various biochemical, and molecular aspects with controls. We will then extend these studies in vivo using Npas2-/-Apoe-/- mice to quantify the contribution of NPAS2 to ABCA1/ABCG1 regulation through zinc finger protein 202 (ZNF202) and atherosclerosis. Together, we expect to demonstrate that macrophage Bmal1 is vital for maintaining cholesterol efflux and preventing atherosclerosis. The outcomes from these studies will impact two fields of biology?atherosclerosis and circadian regulation. New paradigms on the role of Bmal1 in the regulation of cholesterol efflux from macrophage will be established. Regulatory interrelationships between macrophage function and circadian rhythms will be uncovered."
"9357519","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Palliative care and hospice focus on the relief of suffering and achieving the best possible quality of life, including ameliorating symptoms, relieving psychological distress, and promoting spiritual well-being for patients their caregivers. The growth of palliative care programs and services in the United States has paralleled the increased realization of the need for a rational, specialized approach to the care for people with advanced life-limiting chronic illness. A relatively new subspecialty, palliative care is building ts evidence base supporting clinical practice. A new National Institute of Nursing Research funded national research network, the Palliative Care Research Cooperative Group (PCRC), is an efficient mechanism for evidence development including comparative effectiveness research. The fundamental next step is efficient implementation of new evidence and emerging clinical care guidelines into practice. Quality monitoring and performance improvement initiatives are an important approach to reinforce evidence implementation. Over the past 5 years, a regional point-of-care quality monitoring program called QDACT-PC has been developed and piloted in North Carolina; it has been demonstrated to be well-liked by clinicians, usable, feasible, and able to generate reliable information that can be used to benchmark conformance with palliative care quality metrics, drive continuous quality improvement (CQI) activities, and reinforce best practice. One example of low conformance with quality metrics identified in QDACT-PC was related to constipation management; data demonstrate that less than 50% of patients are receiving current best practice interventions to manage constipation and that the symptom is persisting at moderate to severe levels until death.  We propose to introduce QDACT-PC within engaged research and clinical care footprint of the PCRC to create a national network for point-of-care palliative care quality monitoring, and demonstrate its capabilities for conducting CQI projects and reinforcing contemporary standards for clinical best practice. Specific aims of the project include: (1) To develop and nationally implement a PCRC specific version of QDACT-PC (named QDACT-PCRC). Upgrades planned for QDACT-PCRC include the addition of new data elements and question modules about caregivers, clinical sites characteristics, hospital-based palliative care, and questions relevant to Aims 2 and 3. (2) To demonstrate the use of QDACT-PCRC for CQI by conducting a network-wide CQI project in constipation management. QDACT-PCRC will be used to benchmark current conformance across all sites. PCRC clinical providers will develop a performance improvement program to address the symptom and its management. We will use QDACT-PCRC to monitor impact of the initiative, implementing iterative enhancements to the performance improvement program in order to achieve a goal of >90% conformance. (3) To test the use QDACT-PCRC as a mechanism for delivering clinical decision support that reinforces agreed best clinical practice. Palliative Medicine has recently proposed five clinical activities that should not be conducted as a part of ABIM's Choosing Wisely campaign (e.g. PEG tubes at end of life). We will use QDACT-PCRC to measure current rates of these activities being conducted at PCRC sites, to deliver a point- of-care real time education and clinical decision support module to reinforce best practice and to monitor impact, with iterative cycles of system updates as needed based upon impact. The expected outcome of this project is a national system of real-time point-of-care quality monitoring for palliative care, wit demonstrated capabilities to support CQI and implementation of best evidence. A corollary outcome is an aggregating dataset of quality monitoring and clinical implementation information, forming the PCRC Registry - intended to be a national resource to support quality monitoring, research and learning health care."
"9278041","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Project 2 ? Opioid Treatment for Pain: Causes and Consequences Pain is arguably the most prevalent and most expensive public health condition in the U.S., and assessment and treatment of pain have emerged as markers of high-quality health care. Yet one common treatment? opioid pain medication?itself carries serious health risks, including increased pain sensitivity, dependence, and addiction. Opioid use, misuse, and abuse have skyrocketed in the the past two decades, creating a major public health crisis. This crisis has revealed the lack of research evidence to guide health care providers on the appropriate management of chronic pain and the safe prescribing of opioid analgesics. Pain is vastly under- studied compared to other priority conditions such as heart disease, cancer, and dementia, and even less is known about effective pain management in middle-aged and older adults. Using descriptive and quasi-experimental methods, our goal is to understand why opioid use has risen and how this increased use has affected the health and functional outcomes of middle-aged and older Americans. We will use longitudinal survey data and very large administrative medical claims databases that contain detailed information about opioid treatment among commercially insured, publicly insured, and uninsured patients, and which also include information about physicians and their prescribing behavior. Our first Aim is to understand the initiation and use of opioid treatment for pain by different types of patients over time and across geographic regions, with a special focus on the pathways by which individuals progress from short-term opioid use to long-term opioid use. Our second Aim is to identify factors influencing physician prescribing of opioid pain medications, and to measure the concentration of opioid prescribing among physicians by geographic area. Our third Aim is to evaluate how state and federal policies, along with physician prescribing behavior, have affected opioid use, health, and functional outcomes. This project will contribute to the program project's overall goal of understanding trends in population health, with emphasis on how health care providers and public policies shape those trends to improve the health of an aging population."
"9388049","Perioperative visual loss (POVL) is a devastating complication, with no known treatment or prevention, most commonly due to ischemic optic neuropathy (ION), or retinal arterial occlusion (RAO). The highest inci- dence is associated with two of the most commonly performed inpatient surgical procedures in the United States, spinal fusion, and cardiac surgery. The medical and economic burden of sudden, unexpected visual loss is considerable; the emotional toll is immeasurable. It is imperative to understand the risk factors for POVL in order to develop means to prevent these blinding complications. There also exists here a unique opportunity to study the natural history and risk factors for perioperative and spontaneous eye diseases that are among the most common causes of sudden adult vision loss. A most pressing problem in POVL is predicting the high risk individual. Using the National Inpatient Sample, the pro- ject will examine postulated risk factors for POVL, and construct a predictive risk model based on these factors (Aim 1). The risk model will be externally validated using a large commercial insurance database (Aim 2). The central hypothesis is that the presence of specific patient factors, and specific surgical factors, can predict the risk of developing POVL.  Aim 1 will study risk factors and develop a predictive model for perioperative visual loss (POVL) in spinal fusion and cardiac surgery using the NIS, with the following specific hypotheses based on the literature and preliminary data: 1) Perioperative RAO and ION are associated with pre-existing abnormalities of the retina and/or optic nerve; 2) Carotid stenosis and specific forms of stroke increase risk of POVL; 3) Specific surgical factors are associ- ated with POVL, including valvular heart surgery, and extent of fusions in spine surgery; 4) Female sex signifi- cantly decreases risk of POVL.  Aim 2 will externally validate the predictive model from Aim 1 using Optum. We will test the hypothesis that combinations of patient specific and surgical factors are synergistic in defining risk level, such that the ma- jority of POVL incidents are predictable a priori.  The research fits the specific goals of this RFA for 2o analysis of existing data to generate new hypotheses. Innovation includes: 1) the new concept relating pre-existing ophthalmic disease to POVL, 2) using diagnostic and procedural data, and statistical modeling to build a risk profile index, and 3) cross-validation with another database. In addition to direct clinical relevance of both the risk factor determination and the risk model, the translational significance of both is the high likelihood of resulting changes in the care of surgical patients, and development of prevention strategies. The underlying research significance is that the studies will set the groundwork to enable vertical advancement of the field into mechanisms of injury."
"9446022","PROJECT SUMMARY The overarching aim of this proposed project is to develop, optimize, and quantitatively evaluate magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) methods for assessing bone fracture risk. The current standard diagnostic of bone health, dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA), provides an approximate measure of bone mineral density, but it is a projection method that does not incorporate the full contribution of macro-structure, micro- architecture, collagen, or porosity to fracture resistance. Quantitative computed tomography (qCT) is able to partially circumvent these shortcomings of DXA, but remains limited in that it, and other X-ray based methods, are sensitive only to the mineral content of bone, which accounts for only ?40% of bone by volume. This project has demonstrated that bound- and pore-water signals from cortical bone can be independently measured in vivo using MRI, and that these measures report on mechanical properties of bone. The next phase of this project will undertake a combination of technical developments and imaging studies to prepare these MRI methods for clinical use. In Aim 1, the current MRI methods will be accelerated by replacing 3D ultra- short-echo time (UTE) MRI with 2D methods, will be modi?ed to provide more accurate and informative measures, and will be extended to the lumbar vertebra. In Aim 2 the newly developed MRI methods will be evaluated as predictors of the biomechanical properties of cadaver bones (lumbar vertebra and radius). In Aim 3, the methods will be evaluated in vivo in patients with elevated fracture risk. Ultimately, this project will result in MRI methods with the potential for improved clinical diagnostic evaluation of fracture risk and novel imaging biomarkers for the study of bone diseases and pharmacological treatment response."
"9386291","Project Summary/Abstract Cataracts, defined as any opacity in the eye lens, remain the leading cause of blindness in the world despite the success of cataract surgeries. Decades of studies have increased our knowledge about cataract formation, but the underlying mechanisms that regulate lens growth and facilitate lifelong homeostasis remain unclear. The avascular lens maintains fluid and ion homeostasis through a vast network of gap junctions that couple neighboring fibers, and decreased gap junction communication leads to congenital and age-related cataracts in humans. Recent studies have reported that mutations of the EphA2 or ephrin-A5 gene are associated with variable congenital and age-related cataracts in humans and mice, and these bidirectional signaling molecules are key components for regulating lens fiber cell organization and stability.  While EphA2 and ephrin-A5 are a receptor-ligand pair in other cell types, our previous studies and our new preliminary data from EphA2 and ephrin-A5 double knockout lenses indicate that, in mouse lenses, EphA2- ephrin-A5 is not a receptor-ligand pair. Therefore, we hypothesize that ephrin-A5 interacts with another Eph receptor to maintain the anterior epithelium while EphA2 partners with another ephrin ligand to regulate the organization of equatorial epithelial cells and differentiating fiber cells. Members of Eph/ephrin protein family likely play diverse and/or redundant functions to spatially and temporally coordinate the signal transduction network to control distinct properties of lens epithelial cells and fibers. We will evaluate the spatiotemporal expression and localization of Ephs and ephrins in the lens and determine the canonical ligand-mediated bidirectional signaling and non-canonical ligand-independent Eph receptor signaling pathways are that are important for maintaining lens homeostasis. This work will identify the lens Eph-ephrin pairs and determine the downstream pathways activated by Eph-ephrin signaling in the lens.  Intriguingly, our preliminary data also indicates that gap junctions may be compromised in EphA2 knockout lenses that often have mild nuclear cataracts. Our results show that gap junction plaque formation is altered in peripheral knockout lens fibers. We will study age-related changes in EphA2 knockout and ephrin-A5 knockout lenses and test whether disruptions in Eph-ephrin signaling lead to changes in gap junction communication or non-communication-related functions of connexins, including regulation of cell cycle and cell-cell adhesion, in the lens. We will determine whether knockout lenses have altered growth and fiber cell differentiation or adhesion, and/or changes connexin transcript and protein levels, connexin protein cleavage and gap junction plaque assembly/stability. Lens physiology experiments will reveal whether knockout lenses have compromised gap junction conductance and/or ion/fluid homeostasis. This data will provide a better understanding of coordinated signaling mechanisms for maintaining homeostasis in normal lenses, which may lead to the development of new non-surgical approaches to delay or prevent age-related cataract formation."
"9445918","Abstract Up to 80% of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) will suffer from cognitive symptoms, including impaired attention, planning, reasoning and working memory as well as hallucinations, visuospatial dysfunction, and delusions. These impairments lead to mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI) and dementia (PDD) in PD. Cognitive symptoms of PD are associated with enormous cost to our society. There are no clear biomarkers and few effective treatments for PD-MCI/PDD. Because risk for PD increases dramatically with age, this problem will surge as our population grows older. The mechanisms contributing to PD-MCI/PDD are unknown. Our group has found that low-frequency (1-8 Hz; or delta/theta bands) brain rhythms might be helpful in diagnosing cognitive dysfunction in PD. This delta/theta activity originates from areas of medial frontal cortex such as the anterior cingulate, and is detectable by mid-frontal scalp EEG electrodes. We have found that mid-frontal delta/theta brain rhythms are engaged when healthy individuals detect novelty, errors, and conflict, or make decisions. These rhythms are attenuated in PD patients. Our working model is that PD patients manifest diverse neuronal and network deficits that impair mid-frontal delta/theta activity, leading to failures in engaging cognitive control. These abnormalities contribute to PD-MCI and PDD. In this proposal we combine `big-data' machine learning tools, intraoperative neurophysiology in humans, and new brain-stimulation paradigms to investigate the role of mid-frontal delta/theta rhythms in PD. We will test the overall hypothesis that mid-frontal delta/theta impairments are a mechanism of cognitive dysfunction in PD. In Aim 1 we will determine if mid-frontal delta/theta activity predicts PD-MCI/PDD. In Aim 2 we will use unique intraoperative recordings to determine how delta/theta activity within medial frontal cortex influences neurons in the subthalamic nucleus, a key site of functional convergence that is targeted by current deep-brain stimulation for PD. Notably, the subthalamic nucleus is a compact structure that receives highly overlapping input from cognitive and motor cortical regions, making it likely that our recordings will capture cognitive processing within this nucleus. Finally, in Aim 3 we will determine if subthalamic nucleus deep-brain stimulation at delta/theta frequencies improves cognitive control in PD patients. Because these experiments involve recordings across several PD patient populations (Aim 1), from single subthalamic neurons (Aim 2), and brain stimulation (Aim 3), each of these aims will provide independent mechanistic insight into cognitive dysfunction in PD. PD is a complex disease, but if cortical EEG abnormalities are a consistent theme it might inspire new diagnostic tools or new brain-stimulation therapies for cognitive dysfunction in PD. Results from this proposal could also be important for other neurodegenerative diseases such as dementia with Lewy bodies and Alzheimer's disease.  "
"9403478","Summary  Restoring vision to the blind has been an age?old dream, but it took an avalanche of biomedical research and  development over the last few decades to begin turning this dream into reality.  In recent years the potential of saving  and restoring sight has been demonstrated in vitro, in animal models, and in some cases even in human patients.  With  the advent of early clinical trials for these therapies, often primarily aimed at safety and enrolling patients with profound  vision loss, there is a growing need for vision assessments that not only can measure rudimentary vision, but reliably  demonstrate small changes.  Ideally these measures should also demonstrate efficacy in real?world situations, and  include the use of vision for tasks such as eye?hand coordination, orientation, and mobility.  In our laboratory we have demonstrated that the properties of rudimentary ?native? vision can be assessed with a  visual functioning questionnaire specifically designed for ultra?low vision, the ULV?VFQ, and with a set of standardized  visual activities of daily living, the ULV?ADL.  Moreover, we demonstrated that the performance of users of the Argus II  retinal prosthesis system and the BrainPort vision substitution device is very similar to that of individuals with native  ULV.  This application lays out a program to validate the previously completed assessments in a larger ULV population  (Aim 1), to develop a range of additional assessments (Aim 2), to translate a subset of the visual activities used in these  assessments to real?world situations and minimize redundancies (Aim 3), and to assess the similarity in performance  between individuals with native ULV and recipients of the Argus II, BrainPort, and other sight?restoring treatments (Aim  4).  The new assessments under Aim 2 will cover instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) and orientation & mobility  (O&M), and all assessments will cover both static and dynamic scenarios.  Our long?term collaborator Dr. Duane  Geruschat will act as a consultant in the design and evaluation of these assess.ements.  Human subjects testing will be carried out at the Johns Hopkins Wilmer Eye Institute and the Chicago Lighthouse,  which not only counts a substantial ULV population among its employees and clients, but also a number of BrainPort  users.  Investigators at both sites have extensive research experience with this population.  O&M scenarios under Aim 2  will be realized in virtual reality with the assistance of our partners at Balti Virtual.  The resulting assessments promise to  not only have a major impact on future clinical trials of sight?restoring therapies, but also lay the foundation to  rehabilitation approaches for recipients of such therapies.      "
"9441643","Project Summary Alzheimer?s disease (AD) is a devastating neurodegenerative disease that particularly affects people over 65 years old. The major symptom of AD is a difficulty in forming long-term memories of newly acquired information, which requires proper development of synaptic connections between brain neurons at the cellular level. Arc is a neuronal protein specifically linked to the formation of long-term memory: Arc-knockout mice showed substantial deficits in long-lasting memories, but their short-term memories were not affected. However, a substantial knowledge gap exists to explain the molecular mechanism that allows Arc to regulate synaptic connections and affect memory formation, and this shortcoming in the literature has prevented Arc becoming a potential drug target for the treatment of AD. The long-term objective of the PI?s research program is to fill this gap and validate Arc as a new drug target specifically for the treatment of AD. The specific aims in this proposal address some of the fundamental problems in Arc research. These aims include: (1) the elucidation of the 3D structure of the full-length Arc protein; (2) the residue-specific characterization of Arc's binding sites for endophilin, dynamin, and presenilin; and (3) the determination of calcium ions' effect on the structure and function of Arc. These studies will help explain how Arc regulates AMPA receptor trafficking and ?-amyloid generation. They will also provide the knowledge base to understand Arc?s synaptic tagging, degradation, and nuclear transportation processes. To achieve Aim 1, the subdomain proteins of Arc will be produced using bacterial expression system, and their 3D structures will be determined using solution NMR techniques. The obtained structures will be used to help analyze the NMR spectra of the full-length Arc and construct its 3D structure. To achieve Aim 2, the NMR spectra of Arc will be compared with the spectra of Arc binding with endophilin/dynamin/presenilin. The spectra differences can be used to identify amino-acid residues that are responsible for Arc?s binding to different molecules. To achieve Aim 3, calcium ions will be titrated into Arc solutions with or without dynamin/endophilin/presenilin. The changes of the NMR spectra upon titration can be used to determine how calcium ions affect the structure and function of Arc. In our preliminary experiments, we successfully produced a C-terminal subdomain of the Arc protein and determined its 3D structure using NMR, which has laid the foundation for the proposed experiments. Achieving the proposed specific aims will provide new insights into the molecular mechanism of how Arc can modify synaptic connections to regulate memory formation. In the long term, this contributes to the field to use Arc as a drug target to treat AD."
"9449587","Abstract Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a deadly disease with a 5-year survival rate of only 8%. Despite success in other cancer types, immunotherapy approaches in PDAC have not shown efficacy. PDAC demonstrates a heterogeneous and immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) that is poorly understood and serves as a barrier to effective immunotherapy strategies in this disease. We propose that an improved understanding of the TME and novel approaches that target key tumor-stroma interactions will enable remodeling of the immunosuppressive TME to enhance the efficacy of current and future immunotherapy strategies. In particular, we believe that successful combination immunotherapy approaches in PDAC will include strategies that alter myeloid cells to relieve immunosuppression, cytotoxic therapies that target tumor cells to improve immune response, and agents that augment anti-tumor T cell activity. In this project, we will perform a comprehensive characterization of the PDAC TME in both primary and metastatic PDAC in the baseline untreated context as well as across multiple different clinical therapies. In Aim 1, we will utilize single-cell transcriptomic and proteomic technologies to provide a cellular atlas of the PDAC TME at unprecedented resolution. In Aim 2, we will examine how the PDAC TME changes with chemotherapy, radiation therapy and a novel CCR2 inhibitor that modulates macrophage recruitment in the TME. For these studies, we will utilize human samples derived from both resectable and metastatic patients on clinical trials at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. We will employ a novel ex vivo co-culture approach to enable rapid functional evaluation of tumor-stroma interactions and how they may impact immunotherapy responses. Lastly, in Aim 3 we will employ faithful immune competent PDAC mouse models and a novel cytokine delivery platform to investigate how targeted cytokine delivery to the TME may alter myeloid cell recruitment and function and improve immune responses. We have assembled a multi-disciplinary collaborative team including experts in PDAC biology and genetics, immunologists and translational oncologists to comprehensively study PDAC TME and identify novel opportunities to develop combination immunotherapy approaches in this devastating disease."
"9434873","Project Summary/Abstract While the devastating neural consequences (e.g., microcephaly) of fetal ZIKV infection are clear, the neural mechanisms that create those outcomes are not clear. Accumulating research from human cell lines and mice suggest that ZIKV's ability to infect neural progenitors may be one mechanism, but the extent to which these processes impact neuroanatomy in whole organisms and in primate (including human) brains are unknown. The proposed work takes the first step in understanding how ZIKV disrupts brain structure and function by performing whole-brain neuroanatomical analyses on brains from nonhuman primates infected with or exposed to ZIKV. We capitalize upon an already existing NIH-funded resource ? the brains and other biological samples from rhesus macaques exposed to or infected with ZIKV as part of ongoing work establishing the rhesus macaque as a model for human ZIKV infection and testing vaccines for ZIKV. We will quantify the number, density, and cell size of neurons, glia, and dividing cells in a number of representative cortical and subcortical areas in macaques exposed to or infected with ZIKV at various times of fetal development or in adulthood. The overarching goal of the proposed work is to develop an understanding of how the timing of ZIKV infection relative to development and subsequent manifestation of ZIKV both in terms of clinical symptoms (fever, weight loss) and viremia (magnitude of infection, time of active infection) influence disruption of normal central nervous system neuroanatomy."

To meet this objective, the society has since then provided a forum for scientists to interact and exchange information in the field of genetics and genomics. This has been successfully achieved through earlier meetings held in Accra, Ghana - 2003, Washington DC - 2004, Johannesburg, south Africa -2005, Addis Abba, Ethiopia - 2006, Cairo, Egypt - 2007, Yaounde, Cameroon - 2009, Cape Town. South Africa - 2011 , Accra - 2013 and Dakar, Senegal - 2016. Scientists and physicians from over 21 African countries, several European countries, Asia, and the Americas attended these meetings. These meetings have Advanced the fundamental goals of the society including education, networking, capacity building, and research development. In addition, this Society through previous meetings has been instrumental in the development of the African Genome Project. The theme of the upcoming meeting will be Human genetics and genomics in Africa: Challenges for both rare and common genetic disorders. The current proposal is requesting funding for this meeting, one to be held in Rwanda in in 2018 and a third to be held in 2019 in an African host country to be determined. We recognize that as the genomic revolution develops it is important that equity in genetic research and translation into clinical practice needs to be seriously addressed. Previous meetings have dealt with some of these issues, and the results of these meetings have been incorporated into the global genomics enterprise to the extent that African studies, although still relatively rare, are gaining prominence in the genetics literature. The theme of the upcoming meeting has been chosen to specially incorporate several issues in modem genomics research, including the use of Next Generation Sequencing to detect all variants, the role of stem cell research in genetics research and the practical and ethical issues surrounding biobanking of samples in Africa. The Microbiome and Health , Human History and Population Genetics, Genomic Medicine, Networking/Resource Building and Developing Collaborations, and Bioethics and Benefit Sharing are themes that will be explored during the meeting. Invited speakers include Stylianos Antonarakis (Geneva), Raj Ramesar (Cape Town). Clement Adebomowo (Maryland), Moses Joloba (Uganda), Collen Masimirembwa (Harare, Zimbabwe). Chris Mathew (Johannesburg) and Charles Rotimi (NIH), several of whom have attended previous Meetings of the AfSHG. Finally, to better integrate the development of genetic research in Africa, the AfSHG meeting in Cairo will be held jointly with the National Society of Human Genetics of Egypt. This is a strategy that has been used successfully in previous meetings to engage existing African scientific organizations in genomics."
"9484406","The proposed study addresses obesity and health-related disparities among socioeconomically disadvantaged mothers and their young children enrolled in federally-funded home visitation programs. This is important because low-income and racial/ethnic minority mothers and their young children are especially at-risk of obesity. The lack of access to evidence-based obesity efforts further contributes to these disparities. The proposed randomized controlled trial tests the effectiveness of (1) a simple, evidence-based and ecologically relevant obesity intervention (HABITS) delivered as part of ongoing home visitation services, compared to (2) the existing home visitation curriculum without obesity-related content on mothers? and children?s obesity risks. HABITS focuses on habit formation and modifications to the food/activity home environment to promote changes in the targeted weight-related behaviors. Participants will be 298 mothers (>50% African American; 100% meet federal poverty level) and their children (3-5yo at baseline) enrolled in our home visitation partner in central Alabama. Home visitors will be randomly assigned to deliver the home visitation curriculum with or without HABITS as part of their weekly home visits for 12 months. Assessments of mothers (weight, waist circumference, feeding practices and habit strength of targeted behaviors), children (rate of weight gain), and household environment (availability/accessibility/visibility of cues conducive to targeted food, activity and monitoring behaviors) will be conducted at enrollment, 12, and 24mo (1y post-treatment follow-up). Aim 1 (primary outcomes). To compare the effects of treatment on children and mothers? weight outcomes at 12 and 24mo. Hypothesis 1a: Mothers receiving HABITS will have a lower weight and waist circumference than mothers receiving standard services. Hypothesis 1b: Children receiving HABITS will have slower rate of weight gain than children receiving standard services. Aim 2 (secondary outcomes). To compare the effects of treatment on maternal feeding practices, habit strength of targeted behaviors, and features of the household environment relevant to targeted behaviors at 12 and 24 mo. Hypothesis 2: Compared to standard services, HABITS will result in heathier maternal feeding practices (less fried foods and SSB; more vegetables/fruits), greater habit strength of targeted behaviors, and greater home availability/accessibility/visibility of cues that support targeted behaviors. Aim 3 (maternal/environmental transmission of children?s obesity risk). To test whether maternal and household environment variables mediate the effect of HABITS on children?s rate of weight gain at 12 and 24mo. Hypothesis 3: Maternal weight, feeding practices, habit strength of targeted behaviors, and household environment will mediate the relationship between HABITS and children?s rate of weight gain. We will further explore whether primary (Aim 1) and secondary (Aim 2) outcomes differ for African American and White mothers and children, and whether race moderates the relationships between maternal and household environment variables and children?s rate of weight gain (Aim 3)."

"9484829","Abstract - Project 2  TITLE: The effect of a clinician communication coaching intervention on racial  disparities in the quality of communication in cardiology encounters   High quality care depends squarely on communication between clinicians and patients.  Robust evidence links effective communication to important patient outcomes, such as higher  adherence, higher satisfaction, and lower malpractice suits. One study even linked physician  empathy with lower hbA1c levels. Quality of communication differs, however, for African  American compared to white patients. Many have reported race differences both in the  perception of communication and in observed ratings of communication. These race differences  can impact not just the patient experience of care but also the actual care patients receive.  Cardiology is an area where race differences in communication can lead to life altering  outcomes. When cardiologists provide different care based on patient race, disparities in  comorbidity and mortality persist. Although many have documented race differences, few have  attempted to reduce the gap in patient-physician communication between African Americans  and whites.   One strategy for reducing the gap of care involves improving overall communication,  particularly focusing on expressing empathy and attempting to improve patient engagement.  This is especially important in race-discordant (white physician, African-American patient) given  evidence that physicians often struggle communicating with patients of other races. Research  indicates that African Americans engage in less participatory behaviors and physicians elicit  less participatory behaviors among their African American patients compared to Whites.  Teaching physicians how to promote more question asking and support for autonomy for all  patients could reduce this gap. In this application, our multidisciplinary team applies a well-  established approach to achieving clinician-patient alignment in the cardiology setting. We  propose to conduct a two-arm randomized controlled trial with cardiologists in which half of the  cardiologists receive a coaching intervention that focuses on teaching empathic skills and  eliciting participatory behaviors. Our primary outcome is improved physician communication as  assessed by analysis of audio recordings of patient-physician encounters. Our secondary  outcome is patients' perceptions of the quality of patient centered communication. Our premise  is that incorporation of these techniques will improve providers' ability to effectively  communicate with all patients and will reduce racial disparities in actual and perceived quality of  provider communication quality with African-American and White patients."
"9428224","ABSTRACT  Our work to date on the current grant has yielded the following results: a) single mouse parotid cells were found to form three-dimensional (3D) cell clusters displaying TJ and agonist-induced secretory responses when grown on Growth Factor-Reduced Matrigel (GFR-MG) in combination with Fibrin Hydrogel1 (FH), b) the ratio of GRF-MG and FH was optimized with the ultimate goal of creating a functional and clinically safe scaffold1, c) our salivary cell isolation method was improved to maintain secretory granules, form TJ and facilitate cell survival, d) mouse submandibular gland (mSMG) cells, rather than parotid or sublingual glands, were found to be the best choice for creating salivary cell clusters displaying organized morphology, e) critical components were identified within GFR-MG (i.e., EGF and IGF-1) that enhance salivary gland (SG) differentiation when polymerized to FH, f) EGF and IGF-1 were found to be incapable of independently producing organized cell clusters; however, this goal was achieved using Laminin-1 (L1), g) peptides (corresponding to four L1 regions that promote intact SG formation) were synthesized and conjugated to FH, h) specific L1 peptides induced formation of acinar spheres in the rat parotid cell line Par-C10 (as compared to cells grown on FH alone), i) addition of a conditioned medium from human hair follicle mesenchymal stem cells (hHF-MSC CM) improved salivary cell cluster organization and lumen formation in mSMG cells, j) salivary cell clusters maintained acinar, ductal and myoepithelial cells while responding to secretory agonists, k) lumen formation was impeded with the blocking of FGF10 in hHF-MSC CM, l) high amounts of FGF2 were detected in a hHF-MSC CM in which intact salivary cell clusters were grown, m) L1 peptides chemically conjugated to fluorescent FH were applied to wounded mSMG in vivo to form new salivary tissue, as compared to FH alone or no scaffold, and mice were healthy after the treatment. Taken as a whole, the above studies indicate we have accomplished the majority of our initial goals during the first three years of this grant and found viable alternatives for the difficulties encountered (e.g., use of L1 peptides to enhance FH and improve salivary cell clusters formation, as noted above). In the coming grant period, we will refine our design for a clinically safe environment as follows: a) produce a FH modified with L1 peptides and growth factors, b) grow differentiated salivary cell clusters in these matrices and c) use modified FH scaffold to form new and functional tissue in vivo (with aim of later applying these findings to humans with SG dysfunction due to Sjögren's syndrome as well as head and neck ?-irradiation treatments).  "
"9457761","To understand oligodendrocyte differentiation and myelin formation in the CNS, it is essential to define how intracellular signaling pathways regulate the cytoplasmic and nuclear events that drive myelination. A number of signaling pathways have been implicated in driving CNS myelination. The collaborative project between the Macklin and Wood laboratories was initiated to define the function specifically of mTOR signaling in oligodendrocyte and myelin biology. Over the past several years, our laboratories have contributed significant findings on the function of mTOR and its associated complexes through this successful collaboration. The current application addresses a fundamental gap in understanding the mechanisms by which mTOR regulates oligodendrocyte differentiation and myelination through regulating specific downstream targets. Our earlier studies demonstrated that oligodendrocyte loss of mTOR or raptor, the mTORC1-associated protein, results in deficits in oligodendrocyte differentiation and initiation of myelination in the spinal cord. Moreover, we found that these mice have reduced myelin thickness that was sustained in the adult spinal cord. A significant strength of the studies is that we have also begun to define distinct mTOR-dependent and ?independent pathways that regulate developmental myelination in the brain versus spinal cord. The goal of the current studies is to address the fundamental questions of 1) what are the mTOR-dependent mechanisms that regulate the conversion of oligodendrocyte progenitors to differentiating oligodendrocytes through regulating transcriptional machinery, 2) how does mTOR regulate specific cytoskeletal changes necessary for initiation of myelination and myelin wrapping, and 3) how does the crosstalk between mTORC2 and integrin-linked kinase (ILK) pathways regulate myelination in the corpus callosum? We will address these questions in both rodent and zebrafish models by testing the following hypotheses: 1) mTOR promotes oligodendrocyte differentiation by suppressing bone morphogenetic pathway (BMP) signaling and down-regulating transcriptional inhibitors, 2) mTOR promotes initiation of myelination through regulating specific cytoskeletal targets during both process extension and axon wrapping, and 3) rictor regulates myelination in the corpus callosum through promoting Akt473 phosphorylation in coordination with both mTOR and ILK."
"9310644","Project Summary/Abstract Retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells of the eye amass a complex mixture of vitamin A aldehyde adducts with age. These fluorophores have bisretinoid structures, form randomly in photoreceptor cells due to inadvertent reactions and accumulate as the lipofuscin of the cells. The damaging effects of these compounds on RPE cells are implicated in a number of age-associated and early-onset forms of retinal disease including recessive Stargardt disease and age-related macular degeneration. The adverse effects of these pigments are likely due, at least in part, to their propensity to photogenerate reactive oxygen species and to photodegrade into dicarbonyl and aldehyde-bearing fragments. The broad objectives of the studies proposed in this application are to understand mechanisms by which bisretinoids of retina contribute to disease processes that threaten vision. We aim to elucidate therapeutic possibilities and to contribute to interpretations of fundus autofluorescence. We will address both the bisretinoid pigments constituting RPE lipofuscin and the bisretinoid precursors of these compounds in photoreceptor cells. This work will elucidate therapeutic avenues. Additionally since bisretinoids are the major source of fundus autofluorescence, these studies will contribute to clinical interpretations of fundus autofluorescence images. In Specific Aim 1, we will explore interactions between CS and RPE bisretinoids. We will determine whether constituents of CS accelerate bisretinoid lipofuscin formation and outer nuclear layer thinning in Abca4-/- mice. We will investigate interactions between the oxidative stress imposed by cigarette smoke exposure and the photoxidative insult resulting from the deposition of bisretinoids in RPE. In Specific Aim 2, we will explore amine-carrying small molecules for their ability to reduce bisretinoid formation and/or to scavenge carbonyls released by photodegradation of bisretinoid. In Specific Aim 3 we will probe the sources of short-wavelength and near-infrared fundus autofluorescence. These aims will be achieved using animal and in vitro models and by employing biochemical, histological and cellular assays. Completion of this research will advance our understanding of risks associated with age-related macular degeneration and will contribute to an understanding of how light and oxidative mechanisms are factors in photoreceptor cell death in age-related and monogenic retinal disorders."
"9352294","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): My career goal is to mature as an independent health services researcher, with a focus on quality and palliative care, to improve the experience of patients with serious and chronic illness and their caregivers. Palliative care is a newer clinical discipline focused on improving quality of life for all patients, independent of prognosis. Palliative care has achieved remarkable growth, with clinical services present in 66% of all hospitals. Despite such growth, a standardized clinical approach does not yet exist. Such an approach requires evaluating which care processes, recommended by published quality measures, improve patient-centered outcomes the most. Then, the care processes and associated quality measures with the greatest impact can be prioritized. We have developed the infrastructure to perform this investigation. Specifically, I led the development of QDACT-PC (Quality Data Collection Tool Palliative Care), a point-of-care, iPad(tm)-based data collection system that simultaneously populates a registry of care processes, quality measure adherence, and patient and health system outcomes. In September 2013, we were awarded an AHRQ R18 grant to implement QDACT-PC nationally in the Palliative Care Research Cooperative Group (PCRC), the first national research collaborative for palliative care. Analysis aims were reserved by my mentor and the PI of that proposal, Dr. Amy Abernethy, for this K08 application. My research goal is to use this quickly growing registry to explore the impact of quality measure adherence on outcomes in the palliative care setting. Under the guidance of my mentors, I will first, I will describe variability in clinician adherence to a set of 20 core palliative care qualiy measures among 1000 patients. Then, I will use quantitative and qualitative methods to determine the relationship between adherence to a set of palliative care quality measures and patient-reported outcomes, including satisfaction with care, quality of life, and symptom relief. Last, I will investigate the relationship between adherence to a set of quality measures and health service utilization, as measured by 30-day readmission rates, length of stay, and overall health care costs. Together, these aims alongside a robust career development plan and dedicated mentorship, will prepare me for an R01-level submission prospectively testing the identified core set on patient-centered outcomes."
"9409406","Abstract Malignant Pleural Mesothelioma (MPM) is an aggressive cancer effecting the lining of the lungs and is most often caused by exposure to asbestos. MPM is difficult to detect and is typically diagnosed late resulting in a median survival of just one year and a 5-year median survival of only 5-10%. Pemetrexed (Pmx) is the standard of care but quality of life is poor due to Pmx toxicities. The purpose of this Direct to Phase II SBIR grant application is to examine several novel therapeutic molecules as a treatment for patients with MPM. These molecules are unique as they are designed to be small molecule targeted therapeutics. These FTAC (facilitative transporter anti-cancer) molecules (AGF-series) are potent chemotherapeutics which kill cells by inhibiting GARFTase (glycinamide ribonucleotide formyltransferase), which inhibits purine synthesis and results in cell death. But what differentiates FTAC molecules and makes them uniquely effective, is that FTAC molecules exhibit selective uptake by the PCFT (proton-coupled facilitative transporter). The PCFT is a scavenger system that only exists in cancer cells and thereby offers a mechanism to differentiate a cancer cell from a normal healthy cell for a targeted therapeutics approach. Initial studies have shown FTAC molecules to be 100-fold more selective to cancer cells when compared to standard of care (SOC) chemotherapeutics and comparable or superior in cytotoxicity in early animal studies. As the testing of our FTAC molecules is in its infancy but with very exciting and promising results, we plan to thoroughly examine several FTAC molecules to identify those compounds that show maximal selectivity and efficacy with minimal side effects. MPM was chosen as the initial disease to study as it has very few effective therapeutic treatment options for patients and MPM tissues express high levels of PCFT, which should increase FTAC?s targeting efficiency and produce a superior therapeutic with fewer negative side effects. In order to achieve this goal, the following Specific Aims are proposed: Aim 1: Synthesize and test analogs of AGF-094/-238 for improved potency and PCFT selectivity. Aim 2: Testing of compounds for potency and PCFT selectivity in vitro and in vivo. Aim 3: Testing the efficacy of up to 2 compounds in MPM PDX SCID mice models. Aim 4: Initiation of IND enabling safety and DMPK studies on the top compounds for clinical development To the best of our knowledge, these molecules are the first cytotoxic compounds with selective uptake and therefore have the potential to provide a significant clinical benefit to MPM patients."
"9410287","Project Summary  Atrophic (?dry?) age related macular degeneration (AMD) is the leading cause of severe loss of vision for those over age 50. Dietary supplements containing lutein and zeaxanthin are recommended by the NEI for those at risk of late AMD. There has been a corresponding growth in demand for these two xanthophylls.  Lutein and zeaxanthin are currently sourced from marigolds grown mostly overseas. The purity and reliability of these sources is highly variable. A synthetic source for lutein would ensure quality and secure adequate supplies for the predicted ever increasing demand for this eye health product. However, there is no commercially viable synthesis of the natural, enantiomerically correct form (3R,3'R,6'R) of lutein. This barrier prevents the development of a secure, reliable, and scalable source for lutein. Furthermore, the unavailability of pure synthetic isomers prevents definitive experimental studies on their relative effectiveness.  The current proposal seeks to remove this barrier by demonstrating a reliable synthesis of enantiomerically correct lutein and zeaxanthin. The hypothesis is that highly enantiomerically-enriched (4S)-(+)-ipsdienol or (4R)-(?)-ipsdienol can be used to synthesize nature identical lutein or zeaxanthin, respectively. We have developed an innovative enzymatic process that eliminates the current prohibitively high cost to produce enantiomerically-enriched ipsdienol. Furthermore, we will optimize production of recombinant enzymes used in our process, further reducing costs.  Completion of this Phase I project will show the practicality of new production methods for lutein and zeaxanthin. This should lead to significant price reductions for highly pure forms of these chemicals, thus enabling further research into their protective properties. Phase II efforts will confirm the bioactivity of our products and confirm that possible contaminants in natural preparations do not confer the protective effects assigned to lutein and zeaxanthin. We will also seek to expand the potential market for these chemicals as food supplements."
"9458405","Attention deficit symptoms are frequently observed in psychiatric disorders, yet finite understanding of the neural circuits mediating attentional behavior has limited pathophysiologic insight. Previous studies in humans and rodent demonstrate that the frontal cortex?especially the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC)? plays a key role in implementing a top-down control of attention. However, the precise neural circuit mechanisms mediating attention remain largely unknown. The goal of this study is to identify the specific frontal cortex projecting neural circuits that mediate top-down control of attentional behavior. Conserved long-range frontal cortico- cortical projections regulate visual cortex (VIS) responses to visual stimuli in attention based tasks in macaque, and optogenetic manipulation in mice shows that this circuit can enhance visual discrimination sensitivity. Improper frontal modulation of VIS activity in ADHD, schizophrenia, and autism accompanying visual attention deficits may be in part due to the dysfunction of direct long-range projections. However, activity in this circuit has never been directly and specifically examined during attentional behavior, nor has been selectively manipulated to causally improve attentional behavior. Here we will test the hypothesis that long-range top- down cortical circuits directly projecting from frontal cortex to sensory cortex coordinate temporal dynamics between these regions to effectively modulate attentional behavior by implementing an intersectional viral strategy to combinatorially (1) monitor and (2) manipulate neural activity within specific circuits of mice with a translation touchscreen system to assess attention during naturalistic freely moving behavior. In Aim1, we will identify when top-down circuits are activated during attentional behavior. In Aim2, we will manipulate top-down cortical circuit activity to modulate attentional behavior. Here, we will test the hypothesis that top-down cortical circuits coordinate temporal dynamics between ACC and VIS to effectively modulate attentional behavior. At the completion of this study, we will have established a strong basis for the causal role of top-down cortical circuit on attentional behavior."
"9482918","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Cancer is driven both by genetic mutations and microenvironmental factors (e.g. cell-cell interactions). It is now clear that in order to develop effective therapies and predict patient response we need to better understand these interactions. Biomimetic tissue-engineered technologies and models hold the promise of incorporating more components into in vitro/ex vivo models and, thus, make them more accurately reflect human disease. Here we focus on kidney cancer and specifically, on the interactions between cancer cells and the vasculature (i.e. endothelial cells) - an interaction that is understudied, yet critical to better understanding, applying anti-angiogenic drugs and developing new such therapies. Our proposal describes an integrated approach that increases relevance by enabling physiologically relevant models that replicate structure/function relationships while providing patient specificity. Our approach is transdisciplinary including expertise in oncology (Christos Kyriakopoulos), surgery (Jason Abel), pathology (Wei Huang), clinical imaging (Steve Cho), biostatistics/clinical analysis (Kyungmann Kim) and microtechnology/organotypic models (David Beebe). Specifically, we will develop a robust microvessel culture approach (uVESSEL) to create an in vitro/ex vivo model of kidney cancer-vascular interactions using the patient's own cells to measure therapy response of patient specific uVESSEL model (Aim 1), measure patient response via multiple endpoints (incl. PSMA-based PET/CT imaging) (Aim 2), and evaluate predictive value of patient specific uVESSEL model (Aim 3). Our approach is bench to bedside and back again taking advantage of our teams' location with the University of Wisconsin Carbone Cancer Center and access to patient samples. Our goal is to push the boundaries between in vitro models and ex vivo experiments by putting the patient's cells into biomimetic models."
"9474743","Innovative Design Labs (IDL) proposes to create a system to improve the mobility and control of exoskeletons. Recent research has found that 3.86 million Americans require wheelchairs and the number has been increasing annually by an average annual rate of 5.9% per year. While wheelchairs provide freedom, allowing users to be independent as well as reducing dependence upon others, wheelchair use is not physically or emotionally equivalent to walking and is often thought to limit community participation and thus exacerbate social isolation. Robotic exoskeletons/bionic suits have the potential to enable these individuals to stand up and walk, thus providing a way to more fully reintegrate these individuals into society. Our proposal seeks to address one of the hurdles limiting the widespread adoption of exoskeletons in the home and community?the inability of the user to dynamically control gait parameters. This concept has the potential to significantly change the way exoskeletons work and facilitate their adoption into the market. Hypothesis: We hypothesize that the proposed solution will provide users a practical way to adjust their suit?s gait to precisely achieve their navigational goals. Specific Aims: Phase I: 1) Build a prototype and Perform Preliminary Laboratory Testing; 2) Develop and Benchmark Algorithms; and 3) Perform Pilot Human Study of Prototype with Exoskeleton Subjects. Phase II: 1) Develop Customized, Production-Ready Hardware and Firmware 2) Integrate with Exoskeleton Control System; and 3) Perform an evaluation of the system through human study testing."
"9385454","ABSTRACT Leukemia is the most common pediatric cancer affecting more than 40,000 children worldwide each year. During the last three decades, childhood leukemia (CL) incidence has increased in the US by ~35% overall, with an even larger rise among Latinos. This rapid increase implicates environmental factors in CL etiology, possibly in combination with genetic factors. Despite improved treatments for many types of CL, survivors remain at risk for serious complications. The role of environmental factors play in the development of long-term CL complications is unknown. The overarching objective of this proposal is to maintain, enhance, and enrich the infrastructure of two existing NIEHS-funded environmental case-control studies of CL conducted in ethnically-diverse populations of California (California Childhood Leukemia Study; CCLS, 1995-2016) and Guatemala (CRECERÉ study; 2013- 2015). The CCLS has collected a wealth of environmental and genetic data, and assembled a rich inventory of biospecimens and dust samples for up to 2213 CL cases and 1310 controls, making it the most comprehensive CL study worldwide. The CCLS has produced seminal findings, documenting the prenatal origin of CL and identifying many factors that contribute to the development of the disease including: chemical exposures, diet, immune response, and genetic factors. CCLS also supported the development of novel laboratory methods for genome-, epigenome-, and exposome-wide studies of archived newborn dried blood specimens. The maintenance of CCLS resources and the enhancement of data sharing procedures are needed to efficiently expand ongoing etiologic and tumor-biology studies of CL and also to begin new studies on emerging research areas such as prevention, early detection, intervention, and survivorship. Our group has also completed a pilot study of CL in Guatemala that enrolled 50 cases and 50 controls in collaboration with established hospital networks, and collected biospecimens as well as genetic and environmental data with a focus on indoor air pollution. Maintaining these resources is critical to support future expansion of the study in this vulnerable population. In addition, the CCLS--45% of which is comprised of Latino children--and the Guatemala study will support future projects dedicated to identifying the causes of the ethnic disparity in CL risk. These studies will also continue to participate in the Childhood Leukemia International Consortium, as one of the select member cohorts from around the world that include children of Latin American descent. To achieve our goal, we plan to 1) curate and manage the inventory of existing biospecimens (e.g., bone marrow, blood, DBS, saliva, urine), dust samples, and data from medical records, interviews, geographic information system, and laboratory assays; (2) upgrade the biorepository and database capabilities, and (3) enhance data sharing by improving the relational databases used for timely data queries and project planning, developing a database for tracking requests, and designing a website for data sharing. In addition, we propose to enrich the CCLS by measuring novel biomarkers of in-utero psychosocial stress for which the impact on immune function and CL risk is unknown."
"9350201","Project summary  The innate immune system is our first line of defense against viruses, bacteria, and cancer cells. How the innate immune system regulates itself is poorly understood, but we do know that over-activation of innate immunity can cause autoimmune diseases (e.g. lupus and gout) and neurodegenerative diseases (e.g. multiple sclerosis). Worryingly, most current modulators of innate immunity, such as attenuated bacteria, alum crystals, and steroids, are broad, non-specific, and poorly characterized. Thus, while strategies to modulate innate immune defense mechanisms have strong therapeutic potential, such interventions require deep understanding of their molecular underpinnings and their resulting effects on human physiology.  I propose to exploit my interdisciplinary training in chemical biology and innate immunology to drastically increase the cure rates for human cancers by expanding our molecular understanding of innate immunity, which has lagged behind the pack of current immunotherapeutic strategies for treating cancer. I am captivated by the recently discovered innate immune second messenger 2'3'-cGAMP, which is immediately synthesized in the cytosol upon viral infection to elicit downstream immune responses. During my postdoctoral research, my hypothesis that 2'3'-cGAMP has anti-cancer therapeutic potential led me to develop stable, degradation-resistant analogs that caused remarkable tumor shrinkage in mouse models and are currently being tested in clinical trials by a pharmaceutical company.  To preemptively learn how to minimize the adverse effects of 2'3'-cGAMP analogs in humans, I propose to characterize how 2'3'-cGAMP is regulated, either by active transport or enzymatic inactivation. We will illuminate how 2'3'-cGAMP, a small molecule with two negative charges, crosses the cell membrane and why its dominant hydrolase (ENPP1) is extracellular even though 2'3'-cGAMP only functions in the cytosol. We will also develop tool compounds to pharmacologically manipulate 2'3'-cGAMP transport and metabolism and to test their physiological roles in real disease settings. By dramatically increasing our knowledge of key molecular mechanisms that control 2'3'-cGAMP compartmentalization and physiology, both in cell-culture models and in disease models, the proposed high-risk, high-reward investigations will set the stage for developing effective strategies to manipulate these mechanisms, thus revolutionizing our paradigm for cancer immunotherapy."

"9222327","ABSTRACT / PROJECT SUMMARY Overweight and obesity are significant public health problems in the US and contribute to numerous chronic diseases. The National Center for Complementary and Integrated Health (NCCIH) has identified obesity as a priority area for funding, and has issued a Program Announcement (PA-14-182) that uses the R34 mechanism to enhance research in priority areas. This R34 application is designed to build on our pilot studies in the areas of yoga and mindfulness as potential intervention approaches to improve weight loss in adults who are overweight or obese, with these results informing our subsequent R01application. Lifestyle interventions delivered as a standard behavioral weight loss intervention (SBWI) that include diet and physical activity result in weight loss that is associated with improved health-related outcomes. Despite the success of these intervention approaches, there is wide variability in weight loss success. Thus, therapies that are adjunctive to a SBWI approach may be necessary to improve weight loss success. An alternative therapy that may have promise for improved weight control is yoga. Yoga may be beneficial for treating obesity because of its potential to decrease stress, mitigate pain, enhance mood and diminish depression, enhance sleep, and to increase energy expenditure. Despite this potential, few studies have examined the effect of including yoga within the context of a SBWI. In one of the few studies conducted, our pilot study showed that this may contribute to additional weight loss with the context of a SBWI. Within the context of yoga, there are various styles to consider. Our pilot data that included yoga include a restorative style of Hatha yoga. We also have pilot data to demonstrate that Vinyasa yoga, a more vigorous style of yoga, meets the criteria of moderate intensity physical activity, which is consistent across both normal weight, overweight, and obese. However, whether the style of yoga may influence it effectiveness within the context of a SBWI is unclear and has not been examined.  Thus, this R34 application build on our very promising pilot data to prepare us for a subsequent R01 by pursing the following aims: 1. We will refine our standard behavioral weight loss intervention to include two forms of yoga (restorative Hatha yoga and Vinyasa yoga).  This will be accomplished through: a. Refinement of our yoga interventions to assure that they are appropriate for adults with obesity within the context of a behavioral weight loss intervention, and to develop the yoga videos that will also be used by the participants outside of the in-person clinical sessions to enhance engagement. NOTE: Within these aspects of development and refinement we will seek feedback from independent colleagues with expertise in yoga and mind-body interventions, and we will conduct focus groups of study participants following a short intervention to determine if additional refinement is needed. 2. We will examine the feasibility of randomizing and retaining participants within the context of a behavioral weight loss intervention that also includes either style of yoga (restorative Hatha or Vinyasa). 3. We will examine compliance to the yoga components of the intervention. 4. Based on the information obtained within this R34 we will finalize the study protocol and manual of procedures that will be used in the R01 application. NOTE: Following successful completion of this R34, the aim of the subsequent R01 application will be to examine whether weight loss, compliance to dietary recommendations, and compliance to physical activity is enhanced in adults with obesity when different styles of yoga are added to a SBWI, and to better understand the pathways by which yoga may contribute to weight control and related behaviors (diet and physical activity)."
"9515429","ABSTRACT Using human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) as a source of platelets (Plt)s for transfusion medicine is being pursued by a number of groups with several proposing that such a product will soon be available. To achieve this goal, it would be important to generate a Plt product that overcomes challenges associated with donors Plts, including the issue that iPSC-derived hematopoietic progenitors tend to be primitive in nature and the subsequent megakaryocytes, termed Prim-Megs, and the platelets they produce are primitive as well with many quantitative and qualitative limitations due to this immature developmental stage. In our parent R01 application, we follow a number of strategies to define the proper hematopoietic progenitor to generate the highest quality of megakaryocyte with the potential to generate the highest yield and function of derivative Plts. We have focused in the parent grant on obtaining hematopoietic lineages of later developmental stages collectively called definitive hematopoiesis that can generate definitive megakaryocytes, termed Def-Megs. These cells are distinct and have differing abilities to generate Plts with appropriate biologic activity than Prim- Megs. While our parent R01 aims to compare these two populations generated from pluripotent stem cells and optimize the generation of the highest quality megakaryocyte possible, we did not address a final maturation event that occurs after birth: While both neonatal and adult hematopoietic progenitors are definitive and are derived from the same developmental program, the megakaryocytes derived from these populations are distinct. Neonate-Megs are low ploidy and generate Plts with poor activity in clotting assays compared to adult- Megs. Recent work suggests that the RNA binding protein IGF2BP3 may regulate this maturation process. Its expression is lost in adult-Megs and suppression of IGF2BP3 in cord blood neonate-Megs results in maturation more similar to adult-Megs. We show preliminary data that iPSC-derived megakaryocytes (iMegs) also express high levels of IGF2BP3 and its suppression results in higher ploidy megakaryocytes. We now wish to apply these findings to enhance maturation of iMegs in the following 2 Specific Aims (SAs): SA#1: To determine the effect of IGF2BP3 inhibition on maturation of iMegs in vitro. We will utilize various methods to inhibit IGF2BP3 in iMegs and examine the impact on megakaryocyte maturation in vitro. SA#2: To determine the effect of IGF2BP3 inhibition on release of platelets from iMegs in vivo. Using the same methodologies to inhibit IGF2BP3 as in SA#1, we will examine the ability of the megakaryocytes to function in a mouse xeno- infusion model, examining Plt yield, half-life and ability to contribute to clot formation. We believe that these studies will not only be important in bringing such Plts closer to clinical application, but serve as a role model of how one can improve regenerative medicine in general by obtaining adult rather than less functional embryonic tissues."
"9366088","ABSTRACT Retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells in the retina are the major site of disease pathogenesis in numerous macular degenerative diseases. In a subset of these maculopathies, the primary pathological manifestations are localized to the RPE-extracellular matrix (RPE-ECM) complex, suggesting that ECM abnormalities contribute to the underlying disease mechanisms and RPE dysfunction in these maculopathies. In fact, mutations in TIMP3, a gene involved in ECM regulation, leads to Sorsby's fundus dystrophy (SFD), an inherited maculopathy with phenotypic alterations that mimic age-related macular degeneration (AMD). In addition, rare variants of TIMP3 are strongly linked to AMD development and TIMP3 accumulates underneath the RPE in both SFD and AMD. Together, these findings suggest that TIMP3 biology plays a central role in maintaining RPE-ECM homeostasis and that TIMP3 dysfunction contributes to pathophysiology of some maculopathies. However, the consequence of TIMP3 dysfunction on RPE physiology and its role in the development of macular degeneration has not been established. In this proposal, we will elucidate the molecular and pathological consequences of TIMP3 mutation in RPE cells using a patient-derived human- induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-RPE model of SFD. In preliminary studies, SFD hiPSC-RPE develops key pathological manifestation of the disease including, drusen formation and accumulation of TIMP3 in the extracellular matrix. Furthermore, consistent with TIMP3's biological function and pathophysiology of maculopathies affecting RPE-ECM integrity, SFD hiPSC-RPE displays altered expression of 1) pro-angiogenic TIMP3-target matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs; MMP2, MMP14), 2) TNF converting enzyme (TACE) and 3) complement pathway genes. These results support the hypothesis that TIMP3 dysfunction in SFD leads to dysregulation of ECM-turnover and activation of pro-angiogenic and pro-inflammatory signaling that consequently leads to drusen formation and RPE-mediated CNV. To test this hypothesis, we will assess the following predictions in our model system 1)) increased TIMP3 accumulation in ECM in SFD alters ECM composition/turnover and instigates complement activation in turn promoting drusen formation, 2) TIMP3 dysfunction leads to increased expression/activity of MMPs, MMP2 and MMP14, and thereby impaired barrier integrity and VEGF release by RPE cells in SFD and 3) TIMP3 dysfunction leads to TNF-induced pro- inflammatory signaling by RPE. These proposed experiments will provide clear answers the specific role of TIMP3 mutation/dysfunction in drusen biogenesis and RPE-mediated CNV. Ultimately, the knowledge gained in this study will help identify potential drug therapies for targeting TIMP3-induced RPE-ECM alterations in SFD and other maculopathies.!"
"9408988","PROJECT SUMMARY DR is a secondary complication of diabetes and a leading cause of blindness in the world. Although it is well known that DR is driven by ischemia, the current grading of DR severity is based only on structural alterations such as the presence of abnormal retinal microvasculature in non-proliferative DR and angiogenesis in proliferative DR. As a result, when their diagnosis is first received, most patients have already suffered from irreversible retinal functional impairment. DR develops through progressively increasing capillary non- perfusion, leading to insufficient blood supply to meet the metabolic demand of the inner retinal neurons. This causes retinal ischemia, which activates signaling pathways that promote angiogenesis and herald the proliferative phase of retinopathy. If not managed in a timely fashion, proliferative DR can ultimately lead to blindness. Therefore, non-invasive imaging of rMRO2 should improve our understanding of DR pathophysiology as well as significantly enhance our ability to diagnose and manage high-risk DR. Currently, laser panretinal photocoagulation (PRP) remains the standard-of-care intervention for proliferative DR, while anti-VEGF therapy is being aggressively explored as an alternative. In these treatments, the goal is to presumably reduce the overall retinal oxygen demand and ameliorate retinal ischemia or suppress the pathological angiogenesis. However, the exact mechanisms of both PRP and anti-VEGF effects have yet to be confirmed, as there are no human studies that document rMRO2 before and after these treatments. Hence, the failure of treating proliferative DR patients can only be gauged by monitoring the recurrence of angiogenesis, development of vitreous hemorrhage, or progressive retinal tractional detachment, all of which are associated with significant, and occasionally, permanent vision loss. Therefore, non-invasive monitoring of rMRO2 has the potential to significantly improve the management of proliferative DR. Prof. Hao F. Zhang?s group at Northwestern University demonstrated in 2013 that visible light optical coherence tomography (vis-OCT) can accurately quantify retinal sO2 and blood flow. In 2015, the Zhang lab further confirmed that vis-OCT can accurately quantify rMRO2 noninvasively in various rodent models of retinal ischemia and vis-OCT is safe for human use. Therefore, vis-OCT is the ideal candidate to investigate the role of rMRO2 dysregulation in early development, progression, and management of DR. Collaborating with the Zhang lab, Opticent Health?s goal is to translate vis-OCT from bench to bedside and to provide physicians with advanced clinical tools that can accurately and rapidly quantify rMRO2 in patients. Given the fact that vis-OCT is new and there has been limited clinical studies using vis-OCT, the crucial next step is to overcome obstacles that prevent vis-OCT from being smoothly integrated with clinical practices and to examine vis-OCT?s clinical impact. The proposed work addresses this need by developing robust algorithms to enable photographers with limited knowledge in optics and data processing to quickly and reliably measure patient?s rMRO2."
"9338114","ABSTRACT Converging evidence documents moderate to high rates of sexual violence against youth. The 2011 Youth Risk Behavior Survey, a national survey of students in grades 9-12, found a lifetime reported prevalence for unwanted physically forced sexual intercourse of 11.8% for girls and 4.5% for boys (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2012). In addition, physical or verbal sexual harassment is extremely common in schools among adolescents, with one national study reporting that 57% of boys and 50% of girls reported sexually harassing a peer. Despite the importance of this public health problem, sexual violence prevention has a limited evidence base. Equally challenging, most school-based anti-violence programs have focused on individual types of aggression, typically physical aggression occurring within relationships (Leff, Power, Manz, Costigan, & Nabors, 2001). At present few programs systematically address broader social-ecological factors such as school-wide norms and youth-adult connectedness that research identifies as major drivers of SV (Basile, Espelage, Rivers, McMahon, & Simon, 2009). To address this gap, this application proposes a large- scale RCT evaluation of Sources of Strength to evaluate for sexual violence perpetration outcomes. Sources of Strength is an evidence based program for youth suicide that trains student key leaders to strengthen social connectedness and healthy norms school-wide (Wyman et al., 2010) and is listed on the National Registry of Evidence Based Programs and Practices (NREPP). This project will expand the existing evidence base by evaluating Sources of Strength for sexual violence outcomes, which has never been done before. Twenty-four high schools will be recruited and stratified (rural or urban) and randomly assigned to one of two conditions: (a) immediate Sources of Strength intervention, (b) wait-list for Sources of Strength Implementation after 16 months. A representative sample of each school (grades 9-11, in total n = 7200) will be enrolled for repeated longitudinal assessment to assess SoS impact as well as moderators and mediators of its efficacy. The intervention will be rolled out between spring 2017 and spring 2020 with cohorts receiving the intervention for 16 months and completing a total of four assessments. This study is highly innovative and could have substantial public health impact by targeting shared risk and protective factors to demonstrate impact on multiple forms of violence. This approach builds on the call to evaluate `cross over' effective of preventive interventions (Reider & Sims, 2016) in order to identify common prevention pathways to multiple health behavior problems. A strength of our proposed study is measurement of factors across student (behaviors, attitudes, norms), interpersonal (peer social networks), and school-level (school climate based on aggregate school staff reports).  "
"9442191","Abstract Cryo-Electron Microscopy (cryo-EM) is a powerful technique produces volumetric images of large molecules. The images produced at near-atomic (<5Å) resolution can be used to determine the structure of those molecules. Due to experimental difficulties, only small portion of the images are produced at near-atomic resolution while the dominant number of available images is produced at sub/nanometer resolution. At subnanometer  (5-10Å)  resolution,  the backbone of the structure cannot be constructed directly from those images. Nevertheless, de novo modeling can be used to derive the atomic structure of the molecules. The  detection  of  secondary  structure  elements  (helices  and sheets) from the volumetric images is crucial for de novo tools. Moreover, the observation of the structural connections between these elements is extremely helpful in order to answer the topology determination problem. Topology determination problem can be defined as the correspondence between the secondary structure elements found on the sequence of the protein molecule and those found on its cryo-EM volumetric image. This problem is proven to be NP-hard. In this project, a complete de novo system that is capable of efficiently deriving the structure of large molecules from the authentic cryo-EM volumetric images will be developed. The proposed de novo system is divided into a number of components each of which will address an important sub-problem. De novo modeling will be accomplished by three main sub-systems (1) extracting a fine-quality skeleton of the molecule from its noisy cryo-EM image (2) addressing the topology determination problem and (3) building the atomic structure of the target molecule. The extracted skeleton of the protein molecule will be used to confront the problem of topology determination so that the search space size can be drastically reduced. In addition, the skeleton will be used to construct the structure of the molecule. The system will be evaluated using a benchmark of authentic and synthesized images. The novel algorithms that will be developed in the proposed de novo system  are  significant  to  various  fields.  For example, the proposed algorithm of skeletonization can be used by biomedical sciences that use the skeletons. Moreover, the dynamic matching algorithm of this research can be generalized to be used for similar matching problems in any field of study. Further, the proposed system will help understanding the fundamental functions of some protein types such as membrane proteins and large protein molecules that are hard to study using the traditional experimental techniques. This project will bring the effort and skills of the collaborators, Dr. Kamal Al Nasr, Dr. Wei Chen, and Dr. Matthew Hayes from the Department of Computer Science at Tennessee State  University  (TSU),  and  the  consultant,  Dr.  Montserrat Samso from Virginia Commonwealth University (VCU), with the undergraduate and graduate students. The principal investigators will be responsible to develop the proposed algorithms and carry out the design and analysis part of the project. The students will be exposed to bioinformatics research and they will gain hands-on experience  with  some important bioinformatics problems. The students, with the guidance of the principle investigators, will collect data, implement the proposed algorithms, and analyze the results. Further, this project will help TSU prepare a  strong workforce of minority students who can compete with their peers in industry or academia in various areas of bioinformatics. The proposed activities will enhance integration of research and  education  in  biology  and  computer science and it is expected that undergraduate students will be more motivated to pursue career in medical fields."
"9455023","Abstract As new recording methods emerge in neuroscience, new statistical techniques are needed to properly relate neural activity to behavior, a given stimulus, or an internal process. Calcium imaging techniques are now widely used in the ?eld of neuroscience due to their ability to easily record many neurons simultaneously. However, many existing statistical techniques and are formulated for spiketime data. In particular, generalized linear mod- els (GLMs), are developed under the assumption that neural data is in the form of individual spike times. Here, in Aim 1, we propose a framework for extending GLMs to rapidly characterize high-dimensional neural recep- tive ?elds directly from calcium traces. We additionally extend the capabilities of these methods by introducing smoothing priors over receptive ?eld statistics and methods to learn the properties of individual calcium traces on a per-neuron basis that will allow for rapid and ?exible implementation. In Aim 2, we will use these algorithms on two existing datasets from Ilana Witten (Princeton) and Spencer Smith (UNC) to characterize neural response properties in a spatial reward task and a visual psychophysical task. We will formally quantify both spatial tuning in prefrontal neurons and receptive ?eld properties in a range of cortical visual areas in rodents. In Aim 3, we will extend our model to elucidate neural properties as functions of internal network dynamics. This will include identifying pairwise neural in?uences by including post-spike ?lters from simultaneously recorded neural units, and additionally learning a latent dynamic signal that may be shared across all neurons in a given cortical re- gion. Due to the many simultaneously recorded calcium traces in our dataset, we will be able to use to our GLM framework to offer insight into how neural networks process and communicate information to different cortical regions for a range of experimental tasks. Our formalized GLM framework will be ef?cient, ?exible, and generalizable across experiments, brain regions, and even animals. We will make our models available for public use upon their publication such that the calcium imaging community can easily adopt them to help answer their own experimental questions."
"9319031","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Strategies to reduce cardiovascular disease (CVD) and diabetes burden and disparities require the adoption, dissemination and implementation of evidence-based strategies involving both clinical and community partners in alignment with a consistent set of goals that are advanced by multi-sector stakeholders, including front-line public  health agencies, federal agencies, health providers and payors. The proposed application seeks to establish an innovative public-private partnership between the currently funded New York University (NYU) Prevention Research Center (PRC) and the City University of New York School of Public Health (CUNY SPH) that leverages existing collaborations in public health practice and research collaborations between partner institutions and their local, state, and federal public health agencies. The proposed NYU- CUNY PRC focuses on improving the health of communities at risk for CVD disparities through the adoption, dissemination and implementation of integrated, evidence-based community and clinical strategies to advance goals of the Million Hearts Initiative. Our focus will be on Asian and Hispanic American communities, which share commonalities related to immigration, migration, acculturation, language access, and cultural diversity. For the Core Research Project, the NYU-CUNY PRC is partnering with a large health plan to test integrated combinations of community health worker (CHW) models and electronic health record (EHR)-based clinical interventions for CVD prevention in South Asian communities, with an aim.to advance implementation of the Million Hearts Initiative. PRC research activities align with CDC strategic priorities of disseminating health systems interventions to improve the effective delivery and use of clinical and preventive services and improve community-clinical linkages. In addition, the PRC efforts will support efforts to improve physical activity and nutrition, a core component of the Million Hearts Initiatie and a CDC-defined winnable battle. The PRC also aligns with EHR intervention efforts by local and state public health agencies and incorporates a population health surveillance perspective. PRC activities will contribute to understanding of how best to reduce CVD health disparities in Asian and Latino American communities through research, community engagement and training involving the full range of public health practitioners, community partners, academic researchers, and students of public health and medicine. The NYU-CUNY PRC application harnesses the vast breadth of population health resources and expertise across NYC and builds upon the partner institutions' rich foundation of community engagement and strong governmental linkages to address cardiovascular prevention among diverse Asian and Hispanic communities."
"9340335","PROJECT SUMMARY A critical mass of clinical researchers is needed to reduce health disparities affecting minority and underserved communities. The health status of Oklahomans is far below the United States average for many metrics, consistently ranking as one of the five states with the worst overall health. Furthermore, chronic health conditions disproportionately affect minority and underserved communities in the state. Clinical researchers require training, and practical research experiences, in population health, epidemiology, quantitative and qualitative research methods, cultural sensitivity, and community-based participatory research methods in order to form effective partnerships with communities to address health needs. The University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center (OUHSC), with its long-standing mission to educate a diverse body of students at the professional and graduate levels to become highly qualified health services practitioners, educators, and research scientists, is uniquely poised to address health disparities among Native American, Hispanic, African American, and rural populations in Oklahoma by enhancing the training programs and research career development programs for clinical investigators, specifically minority and underrepresented investigators. Furthermore, a critical mass of senior investigators with extensive mentoring experience and a diverse portfolio of health disparities research projects is available to mentor the cohort of program participants. With an overall goal to enhance clinical research methods expertise and research careers among minority researchers, we will complete the following specific aims: (1)To enrich the existing Master of Science in Clinical and Translational Science degree curriculum to include expanded coursework in methods of qualitative research, community assessment and intervention, cultural sensitivity, and community-based participatory research with a focus on health disparities affecting minority and underserved communities, (2) To support and guide post-doctoral minority clinical and population health investigators in their development of independent research programs focused on cardiovascular, cancer, diabetes, and rheumatic disease-related health disparities among minority and underserved communities through mentored research experiences, and (3) To expand the cadre of minority investigators who have research skills necessary to meaningfully engage with minority and underserved communities in health disparities research through dissemination of program components to improve the health of Oklahomans, tribal nation citizens, and communities with similar health challenges. The training programs will undergo ongoing program evaluation and revision to address the skill development needs of the researchers. The impact of this proposed project will be broadened through the dissemination of the resulting training and educational programs."
"9339711","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The growing family of optogenetic tools seeks to control and monitor cellular activity through light. These genetically encoded proteins have revolutionized neuroscience. Recent advances in the field have discovered a new generation of channelrhodopsin tools (CheRiff, ChrimsonR, and Chronos), whose improved properties have allowed the demonstration of all-optical electrophysiology and multicolor stimulation of a cell population. However, the structural basis of these functional gains is unknown. To date, the C1C2 chimera is the only channelrhodopsin (ChR) with a solved crystal structure. To support increasingly challenging experiments in neurobiology and to facilitate the use of optogenetics in other disciplines, improved channelrhodopsin tools are required. To understand the functional advances discovered in the latest generation of ChRs, structural information is required. I propose to solve a new ChR structure to support and guide efforts in protein engineering. A membrane protein structure is a challenging task, but we have several options and opportunities to overcome common obstacles. In parallel, I will use protein recombination to explore the structure-function relationship of the latest generation of ChRs. Guided by structural information, this SCHEMA method of protein engineering involves swapping blocks of sequence between parental ChRs while minimizing disruption of the tertiary structure. Accurate structural information of a parental ChR will allow for more robust SCHEMA predictions. However, preliminary tests will make use of a homology model (CheRiff model based on C1C2) and a conservative, low- energy chimera library. A representative fraction of this library will be synthesized and transfected into mammalian cells, where several ChR properties will be characterized. This test set will establish links between function and blocks of structure, which will enable modeling and prediction of new block combinations that have desired properties. Throughout the process of recombination we will gain valuable information about structure-function links, and I will produce several functional chimeras. Screening chimeric proteins was a key factor in solving the C1C2 crystal structure, and those chimeras with properties that rival their parents will be added into the structure target pool. Likewise structural information can be used to guide more ambitious chimeragenesis. In this way protein engineering and structural analysis may be used synergistically."
"9437068","TITLE: Popular Opinion Leaders as a Sports Concussion Prevention Strategy in Middle Schools FOA: RFA-CE-17-002, Development and Evaluation of Sports Concussion Prevention Strategies PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT: Prevention of concussion is a key priority in the safety of young athletes participating in sport. Accordingly, a major focus over the past decade has been increasing the knowledge and awareness of concussion signs, symptoms, and management strategies. However, few studies have addressed primary and secondary prevention in the youth sport, particularly the middle school sport setting. Research is needed to develop and understand the most effective strategies for concussion prevention and management in this young population. Additionally, these strategies and interventions should be feasible and sustainable. We will address these research needs by developing and piloting a new intervention utilizing a Popular Opinion Leader (POL) model to prevent concussions in middle school sports. The study will include a diverse group of middle school sports teams from two school districts. Five youth sports with a high incidence of concussion and diverse participants (football, boys? soccer, girls? soccer, boys? basketball, and girls? basketball) will be studied. The project has three key aims. First, using formative methods, we will identify the institutional (Aim 1.1), team (Aim 1.2), peer (Aim 1.3) and personal (Aim 1.4) facilitators and barriers to adopting and implementing a POL concussion intervention in middle school football, basketball, and soccer sports communities. Second, we will determine the effect of a POL intervention on concussion-related behavioral and environmental determinants, including attitudes, beliefs, intentions, perceived control, and normative perceptions, among parents (Aim 2.1), coaches (Aim 2.2), and student-athletes (Aim 2.3) participating in middle school football, basketball, and soccer. Third, we will determine the effect of a POL intervention on concussion risk and clinical management, through decreased head impact frequency (Aim 3.1), increased reporting of suspected concussions (Aim 3.2), changes in concussion incidence (Aim 3.3), and improved management of confirmed concussions (Aim 3.4) among middle school student-athletes participating in football, basketball, and soccer. This study will significantly advance our scientific knowledge on the impact of a local concussion prevention programs on knowledge, attitudes, behaviors, and health outcomes in youth sports."
"9395305","Direct readout of spiking and subthreshold voltage activity from genetically-specified neural populations will facilitate major advances in our understanding of neural computation at the network level. For this reason, developing a genetically encoded voltage indicator (GEVI) with adequate speed, membrane localization, and brightness to report action potentials in mammalian cells has been a major goal in neuroscience for the past two decades. Recently, we developed an opsin-based GEVI, called Archon, which exhibits good localization in neurons of multiple species, several fold improved brightness over previous opsin-based reporters, order-of-magnitude improvements in voltage sensitivity and photo bleaching over GFP-like reporters, and compatibility with optogenetic control. However, action potential imaging, even in a single Archon-expressing neuron, requires a state of the art sCMOS camera to meet sample-rate and signal-to-noise (SNR) requirements. These devices are large, power-hungry, bandwidth intensive, and support a limited field of view at maximal frame rate. This precludes their integration into head-mountable devices and greatly limits their ability to image large numbers of cells. The goal of this proposal is to create a head mountable miniature microscope (?miniscope?) that enables high speed (>1000 frames per second; FPS) voltage imaging of neural populations in freely moving animals. To do this, we will adapt our recently developed integrated compressed sensing CMOS image sensor with pixel-wise exposure (?CS-PCE Camera?) for GEVI imaging. The CS- PCE camera's key innovation is to permit independent exposure of each pixel on the sensor array instead of exposing the entire array in lock-step with a frame clock. This enables CS reconstruction of high speed video from samples acquired much more slowly than the Shannon/Nyquist rate. In this proposal, we demonstrate that a 1000 FPS video of Archon readout of neuronal action potentials can be accurately reconstructed from a CS-PCE camera operated at 100 FPS. We demonstrate that using long pixel-wise exposure and slow readout saves power, reduces system size, and increases the SNR while maintaining action potential detectability compared to state of the art sCMOS imaging devices. Taken together, we aim to provide a genetically-targetable replacement for microelectrode-based recordings, which has been a long sought after goal in systems neuroscience research. To evaluate device performance, we will use the CS-PCE miniscope to record hippocampal place-cell sequence replay, which exceeds the temporal bandwidth of calcium-based functional imaging techniques and is currently only accessible using electrical recordings."
"9520730","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Delirium, consisting of the acute onset of inattention, global cognitive impairment, and other neuropsychiatric symptoms, is a common, serious, and often preventable syndrome among hospitalized and institutionalized elders. At a cost of over $118 billion per year, delirium is associated with adverse outcomes including persistent cognitive decline, loss of independence, and death. A major challenge in advancing treatment trials and prognostic studies has been inadequacies in the current measurement of delirium severity, such as a tendency to overweight hyperactive features or to require highly skilled clinician raters. To address these limitations, our goal is to develop a Delirium Severity Toolkit,a dynamic set of six new measures developed with expert clinical judgment and patient/family/nurse input using modern psychometric theory. Our measures will capture the severity of delirium in various phenomenological presentations (e.g., hypoactive, hyperactive), incorporate multiple perspectives (patient, family member, and nurse), will be useful to a broad array of stakeholders (physicians, nurses, patients, family caregivers, researchers, and policy-makers), and will be developed using state-of-the-art procedures that combine qualitative and quantitative approaches such as those developed and utilized in current major NIH-supported measurement initiatives (e.g., PROMIS, NIH Toolbox, Neuro-QOL). Moreover, our development work will be in compliance with FDA guidance on instrument development to assure applicability for future clinical trials. Our aims are to (1) develop clinical measures of delirium severity that reflect the presence and intensity of multiple dimensions of symptoms; (2) compare these against subjective ratings of delirium severity by patient, family, and nurses; and (3) determine the predictive validity of the measures of delirium severity against adverse clinical outcomes (e.g., functional decline, hospital or post-acute length of stay, institutionalization, healthcare utilization and costs). In the course of instrument development we will demonstrate face, content, and criterion validity, and test responsiveness to change and reliability. To accomplish our aims, we will convene panels of clinical experts, conduct in-depth qualitative interviews with 30 patients, 30 family members, and 30 nurses; develop and refine delirium severity instruments, conduct a field study in 300 patients on 3 services (medicine, surgery, and post-acute care), calibrate and publish final versions (short, long, and computerized adaptive versions) of our 6 delirium severity measures that are ready to use in clinical and research settings. Our approach is innovative since it will fundamentally advance the conceptualization of delirium severity, result in new measures that address limitations in current severity measures, and provide a publicly available item bank for ongoing improvement, validation, and dissemination. We believe that the proposed measurement is essential to advance our understanding of the syndrome of delirium and our ability to effectively treat this important problem."
"9564267","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Glaucoma is a leading cause of irreversible blindness in the world. Elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) is a strong risk factor and remains the only modifiable target for intervention. However, the mechanisms causing elevated IOP remain poorly understood. Using Oculocerebrorenal syndrome of Lowe, a rare X-linked disease that presents with congenital glaucoma, we have found evidence that OCRL is an important regulator of trafficking in the eye that controls IOP. OCRL is an inositol phosphatase mutated in Lowe syndrome. OCRL localizes within the primary cilium, a subcellular organelle that plays a mechanosensory role in fluid flow. We have identified patients with Lowe syndrome who are born with congenital glaucoma and have characterized their mutations. We discovered that OCRL interacts with TRPV4, a mechanosensory channel in the primary cilia and that modulation of TRPV4 affects IOP in mice. Thus we hypothesize that OCRL plays a critical role in the recruitment of TRPV4 to the cilia in the trabecular meshwork to regulate aqueous outflow. Our aims are to (1) determine the mechanism of OCRL transport in the primary cilium in the trabecular meshwork, (2) determine the functional role of OCRL and TRPV4 interaction in the primary cilium, (3) determine whether targeting TRPV4 can reduce IOP in murine models. The experiments of this proposal may facilitate the discovery of new glaucoma therapies that can reduce the burden of blindness."
"9218495","Objectives: The goals of this proposal are to evaluate the effectiveness of a novel culturally- tailored dementia education intervention to a) teach young children to recognize dementia symptoms and demonstrate an appropriate action plan (which we have termed dementia literacy) and b) have these dementia literate children teach and improve dementia literacy their parents and grandparents. Background: Dementia is common among elderly individuals, becomes more prevalent with age, is medically refractory, reduces life expectancy, and diminishes quality of life for patients and their caregivers. Cultural barriers to dementia diagnosis exist and are potentially modifiable. Interventions that target younger generations may shift cultural perceptions and improve acceptance of dementia and reduce barriers to early diagnosis. Emerging evidence suggests that early cognitive impairment may have modifiable or preventable components and a combination of medical and lifestyle interventions may delay or reduce cognitive decline, particularly when delivered early in the course of disease. Health literacy, including perceptions of cognitive aging and awareness of possible modifiable determinants, could be unrealized barriers to diminishing the health disparity of dementia. Youth education programs focused on dementia could increase community dementia awareness, improve AD literacy of parents and grandparents of dementia- literate children, shift cultural perceptions of AD to improve its acceptance, and reduce barriers to early diagnosis. Such an approach could uniquely engage minority populations who are least engaged and at greatest risk for AD. Methods: The Intervention. ?Old SCHOOL Hip Hop? (Seniors Can Have Optimal aging and Ongoing Longevity) is a validated model using a brief multimedia culturally tailored intervention designed to teach minority children key dementia signs and symptoms, and actions taken when dementia is recognized, which is early clinical evaluation by a physician. Twenty schools (with 3000 total students) will be randomly assigned to either the OSHH intervention arm or attentional control. This program will test the hypotheses that the program will lead to significant improvement of dementia knowledge in parents, and that gains are influenced by child knowledge, the degree of child-parent communication about the topic, and socioeconomic status. The program is additionally designed to create a novel, brief ?dementia action test? to fulfill a critical missing tool for efficiently assessing dementia recognition and behavioral response."
"9354448","Background: In 2011, 721,800 healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) were reported in the United States. The hospital environment has been increasingly recognized as an important determinant of HAI acquisition and prevention of HAIs has become a top priority for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). Terminal cleaning of a patient room is recognized as a critically important process to help prevent HAIs and involves extensive cleaning and disinfection of the room after a patient has been discharged from the room and before the subsequent patient has been admitted to the room. Pulsed xenon ultraviolet light (PX-UV) has been shown to be effective in killing a variety of pathogens including endospores of Clostridium difficile. PX-UV works quickly ? the entire cycle time for use in a hospital room is 15 minutes. To date, the clinical impact of adding PX-UV to terminal cleaning has not been demonstrated in clinical trials with sham controls or in a crossover design. The long-term goal of this project is to establish the efficacy of terminal cleaning plus PX-UV in reducing rates of HAIs due to the following multi-drug resistant oranisms (MDROs): C. difficile, vancomycin- resistant enterococci (VRE), Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichiae coli producing extended-spectrum beta- lactamases (ESBLs), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Acinetobacter baumannii. The objective of this application is to conduct a prospective, sham controlled, double-blinded, interventional crossover trial to compare standard terminal cleaning plus PX-UV (intervention) with standard terminal cleaning plus sham PX-UV (control) with crossover at 12 months, following a 6-month washout period. Outcome measures include the rates of HAIs, as well as the recurrence of genetically identical clinical strains of HAIs among patients on study units. The study will be conducted in 2 hospitals covering 16 total hospital units at Detroit Medical Center. Our central hypothesis is that the addition of PX-UV to standard terminal cleaning will be associated with a significant reduction in the rate of HAIs, as well as a reduction in the recovery of genetically identical strains of MDROs. The impact of PX-UV disinfection on rates of HAIs on study units will be determined by comparing rates of HAIs on a) study units where PX-UV is added to standard terminal cleaning practices to b) units where a sham UV disinfection system is added to standard terminal cleaning; and by comparing rates of HAIs on the same medical ward during each of two 12-month phases of a crossover study (one phase when a PX-UV device is added and one when a sham device is added to standard terminal cleaning). At the conclusion of the proposed project, novel data will be generated from this rigorously controlled study regarding the effectiveness of PX-UV in reducing HAIs in a representative, real-world healthcare setting."
"9465934","Project Summary/Abstract The cerebellum is a brain structure found in all vertebrates, and it has been studied for decades primarily for its role in coordinating motor activity. More recently, an abundance of evidence has surfaced linking the cerebellum to cognitive functions, such as working memory and reward prediction. It is known that the cerebellum is anatomically connected to the cerebral cortex, and specifically to multiple regions known to be important for supporting memory and reward-learning functions. However, it remains unknown how the cerebellum contributes to these cognitive functions, and more generally, what cellular and circuit mechanisms it employs to process information. To advance our understanding of this region and its role in disease, we will use a mouse behavioral paradigm that will allow us to investigate the cellular activity of the cerebellum, and to characterize how it computes information to make these contributions to behavior. We have developed a behavioral task that is well suited to quantitatively address these questions. We will employ modern technologies to image and manipulate the activity of cerebellar neurons in awake, behaving mice performing the task. With two-photon microscopy and genetically encoded calcium indicators, we will visualize the live activity of hundreds of neurons simultaneously while mice behave. With optogenetics, we will inactivate the cerebellum during temporally precise phases of the behavior. This will allow us to determine which aspects of behavior are dependent upon cerebellum. These experiments will enable us to characterize the relationship between the activity of cerebellar neuronal networks and behavior. By studying cerebellar activity at the level of neural circuits during behavior, we will characterize how the cerebellum contributes to normal and abnormal cognitive function. With improved characterization of the circuits that are commonly dysfunctional in prevalent neuropsychiatric diseases like autism and schizophrenia, we will come closer to understanding the underlying causes of these disorders and of normal brain function."
"9432769","Project Summary (Abstract) Although receiving significantly growing attention, reconstruction of long-segment tracheal defect still remains challenging in many non-malignant tracheal diseases. Transplantation of trachea can be exceptionally difficult given the recalcitrant restoration of blood supply to the graft. Tissue-engineering approaches, on the other hand, have been met with failure due to the complex anatomy and functions of trachea. To date, engineered solutions, where either synthetic or decellularized scaffolds are used, have still been confronted with a variety of insurmountable hurdles, including: 1) inadequate length and diameter, 2) incomplete endoluminal healing (epithelialization) that result in perforations/air leaks/strictures/infection, 3) absence of glandular function, 4) limited vascularity, 5) inadequate mechanical properties to accommodate luminal pressure changes, and 6) inability to grow with the patient. Here we propose a new design of a hybrid trachea that integrates the complementary strengths from autologous grafting, allogeneic tissue niches, and synthetic scaffolding to form a novel construct. We aim to use the hybrid trachea to address simultaneously all these hurdles. The unique helical design of the hybrid trachea enables the construct with increased flexibility to adapt to desired dimensions, avoiding complications seen with incompatible transplants. To test the concept and preliminary efficacy of the designed hybrid, two overarching aims have been developed. The first objective of the project is to utilize an image-based technique we have developed to design the structure of a synthetic scaffold as the spiral backbone that will be fabricated with polycaprolactone by 3-D printing. The scaffold will then be coated with decellularized, morselized tracheal matrix to form a bio-inspired substrate. In the meantime, a decellularized trachea allograft will be prepared as a complimentary helix to the backbone scaffold. Both components will then be assembled into a tracheal construct for the following implantation. The final assembly will be mechanically assessed to ensure the initial structural integrity. The second objective is to test the efficacy of the designed hybrid trachea in a porcine model with complete tracheal resection. This will be performed with the two-staged homograft technique that has been shown to retain functional cilia and mucin production in our previous work in a rabbit model. Reconstructed tracheas will be harvested and assessed for restoration of structure and functions. Although these aims have an enormous potential to address the major hurdles identified in long-segment tracheal reconstruction, the idea also has a high level of risk with the uncertainty for how both synthetic and naturally derived components can be integrated in an optimal way to facilitate the tracheal reconstruction. We hope to utilize this unique funding opportunity to explore the development phase of the new hybrid trachea. If successful, the venture may lead to the future phase of pursuing larger scale funding support through Bioengineering Research Grants."
"9565014","ABSTRACT  Alzheimer?s disease (AD) is the most common and severe age-associated neurodegenerative dementia for which finding a resolving cure is a pressing national priority. The discovery of resilient individuals who remain cognitively intact despite the presence of AD neuropathology normally associated with a fully symptomatic stages of the disease, suggests that there is a way for the brain to evade dementia even in the face of AD. It follows that understanding the mechanism(s) involved in such extraordinary resistance would reveal targets for the development of a novel, effective therapeutic concept based on inducing cognitive resilience in anyone challenged with AD neuropathology. With this goal in mind, we have discovered that brain synapses in these unaffected individuals are resistant to the disrupting binding of toxic oligomers of both amyloid beta (A?) and tau (an event linked to onset of dementia in AD) and that this resistance is associated with the presence of higher numbers of neural stem cells (NSC) in the hippocampus as compared to either AD patients and control subjects. While these observations suggest a link between sustained neurogenesis and synaptic resistance to damaging amyloid oligomers, the involved mechanism (an obvious treatment target) remains unknown. Based on exciting new, compelling preliminary data involving exosomes specifically released from NSC as mediators of this phenomenon, in this project we will test the hypothesis that NSC-derived exosomes render synapses resistant to the disrupting binding of A? and tau oligomers and thus protect from memory deficits. Employing both ex vivo and in vivo models of A? and tau oligomer-induced synaptic dysfunction and cognitive impairment, in Specific Aim 1 we will test the hypothesis that NSC-derived exosomes reduce synaptic susceptibility to amyloid oligomers binding and its functional consequences. In Specific Aim 2 we will characterize microRNAs present in NSC-exosomes responsible for these effects.  At the completion of the proposed studies we will have documented a previously unappreciated phenomenon of synaptic resistance to A? and tau oligomers mediated by NSC-exosomes and discovered specific miRNAs that can promote it. Given the translational value of miRNAs for drug development, this discovery will have a substantial impact in the field by illustrating targets for the development of an innovative treatment concept for AD centered on promoting synaptic resistance to toxic oligomers, a strategy expected to be effective in humans as suggested by the existence of NDAN subjects. A uniquely qualified investigative team has been assembled to successfully accomplish this project, bringing together expertise in AD molecular neurobiology (Taglialatela), NSC biology (Micci), biochemistry of amyloid proteins (Kayed), miRNA sequencing and analysis (Widen), electrophysiology and animal behavior (Krishnan)."
"9564290","PROJECT SUMMARY It has been shown that in utero tobacco exposure increases offspring risk for a number of diseases including obesity and diabetes, which are significant burdens on the healthcare system in the US and worldwide. As part of a pilot study in Kentucky, 30% of pregnant mothers reported that they actively smoked cigarettes during their pregnancy, and it was shown that tissues from babies born to smoking mothers had altered metabolic gene expression and DNA methylation levels compared to babies born to nonsmokers. Further, primary fibroblasts isolated from babies born to smokers took up more lipids and had impaired insulin signaling compared to cells isolated from babies born to nonsmokers. These observations form the basis of the hypotheses that 1) the DNA methylation pattern and expression of key energy metabolism genes and their resulting proteins will be significantly altered in the neonatal tissue of babies born to active smokers compared to those born to nonsmokers, 2) living cells isolated from babies born to active smokers will be functionally dysregulated compared to cells taken from babies of nonsmokers, and 3) biomarkers that are identified will be predictive of increased growth rates and pediatric obesity. The goal of Specific Aim 1 is to establish biomarkers and potential mechanisms contributing to offspring obesity and diabetes risk resulting from in utero cigarette exposure. Gene expression and epigenetic alterations will be quantified in neonatal tissue in order to establish differences between exposure groups. Specific Aim 2 will determine the extent to which neonatal cells are uniquely programmed by in utero smoke exposure. Primary skin fibroblasts will be isolated from neonates and grown in culture. Glucose uptake and susceptibility to differentiate into adipocyte-like cells will be assessed as it is likely these cells are already dysfunctional at birth. Finally, the goal of Specific Aim 3 is to use gene expression data, DNA methylation changes, and cell function measures as potential biomarkers that will predict increased growth rates and obesity susceptibility in male infants that were exposed to tobacco smoke in utero. Using primary fibroblasts isolated from neonates in order to measure adipogenesis and glucose uptake in live cells is not currently possible using any other model system to explore the effects of maternal smoking on offspring. The proposed study provides a human system to demonstrate the mechanisms through which tobacco smoke exposure in utero contributes to the epidemic of childhood obesity. Research findings and this system could also provide an innovative approach to understand the effects of various other in utero exposures on metabolic outcomes in children. Future work can also utilize this model to investigate new preventative and intervention approaches targeting these pathways."
"9547614","PROJECT SUMMARY  The NEI Audacious Goals Initiative is a bold effort to ?to restore vision through regeneration of neurons and neural connections in the eye and visual system.? One of the major roadblocks in mammalian photoreceptor transplantation experiments has been, and continues to be, the low efficiency of integration and synapse formation following transplantation of photoreceptor populations. In order to address this roadblock, and in response to RFA-EY-15-002 (which is directed at ?discovery-based approaches to identify unknown factors critical to the regeneration of neurons, guiding their axons to targets, and making new functional connections?), we propose to combine state-of-the-art stem cell methodologies with high content screening approaches to identify novel small molecules and molecular pathways that promote human photoreceptor axonal outgrowth and synapse formation. To accomplish this ambitious goal, we have assembled a multidisciplinary group of investigators who have years of experience in human retinal stem cell biology, retinal cell and molecular biology, high content screening (HCS) assay development and drug screening, axonal guidance, synaptic biology, and microfluidics.  Members of the research team have already carried out screens that have successfully identified molecules that promote neurite outgrowth of murine retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) and other retinal neurons, and that increase synapse formation in cultures of human stem cell-derived neurons. For this project, we propose to extend this prior work and develop robust and reproducible in vitro neurite outgrowth and synaptogenesis assays using photoreceptors (PRs) obtained from human pluripotent stem cell (hPSCs) derived 3-dimensional optic vesicle-like structures, and then to use these assays to identify and characterize biologically and clinically relevant molecules. More specifically, SA1 will focus on the development and execution of a two-tiered in vitro screen designed to identify molecules that influence hPSC-PRs axon outgrowth and/or guidance; SA2 will focus on a screen to identify molecules that enhance hPSC-PR synaptic marker expression; and SA3 will focus on the development of assays to confirm functional PR synapse formation in culture. Successful completion of these aims and milestones will yield the first in vitro human assay system designed to rapidly screen and rigorously test molecules for their ability to promote hPSC-PR connectivity. This platform should not only accelerate efforts to achieve functional PR replacement in patients, but could also serve as a valuable human preclinical model system."
"9470326","Summary We are requesting support for the 2018 Neuroelectronic Interfaces: Beyond Feasibility - Bridging the Gap in Neuroelectronic Interfaces GRC, which will be held March 25th ? March 30th, 2018, at the Hotel Galzez, in Galveston, TX. The Neuroelectronic Interfaces Gordon Research Conference is the first ever of its kind for neural interfaces. The conference promises to rapidly become a highly successful venue to bringing together world-class clinicians, scientists, and engineers with a multi-disciplinary skillset in cellular neuroscience, brain pathology, neuro-technology and materials science in order to discuss, and eventually solve or discard the obstacles to chronically useful and reliable neural interface. The expectation for Gordon Research Conferences is that vigorous formal and informal discussions will be maximized between prominent investigators and junior attendees of the conferences, with particular emphasis being placed on underrepresented groups, women, minorities, and persons with disabilities. Because of the funds we hope to acquire from the pending proposal, support for travel and registration for speakers, discussions leaders, post-doctoral fellows and graduate students who attend the conference with priority going toward the support of members of underrepresented groups. Thus, we will foster the development of and continued involvement of qualified students and researchers from minority groups in neural engineering research. Additionally, the 2018 conference program is inspiring in the range of topics and in the quality and diversity of speakers. We have assembled a program (100% confirmed) that we are confident will lead to a lively and inspiring conference that is at the cutting edge of science and engineering. The program covers major recent trends in Neuroelectronic Interface research, including the state of the art, critical hurdles to be overcome, and inspiring sessions from tangential fields that could pave the way to success. This GRC will provide a forum for the findings of established scientists engaged in other biomedical areas to enable identification of new concepts for, and potential collaboration in, neural interfaces research. Therefore, we expect to change the landscape of the Neural Interfacing Community's conference circuit, and become a lasting tradition, worthy of the prestige of the Gordon Conferences, effectively becoming a ?go to meeting for neural interfacing.?"
"9319037","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose a Prevention Research Center that uses community-based prevention marketing (CBPM) to adapt, implement, evaluate, and disseminate evidence-based approaches to strengthen state and local health departments' and community coalitions' capacity for sustained disease prevention and health promotion. The FPRC's health priority will be the reduction of cancer disparities, and the core research project for the next five years will focus on the promotion of colorectal cancer screening (CRCS). The FPRC's mission and core research are responsive to the Guide to Community Preventive Services' focus on multilevel interventions to increase screening for cancer. The core research project will focus on colorectal cancer (CRC), selected by our State partner - the Florida Department of Health (FDOH), because it is the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths among men and women in the U.S. While scientific cancer advances are occurring, racial ethnic minorities and the medically underserved have consistently experienced the highest CRC mortality rates. The aims of the core research project are to: 1) examine disparities in late stage  colorectal cancer incidence and screening rates to identify priority populations; 2) identify appropriate and feasible evidence-based interventions (EBI) for the priority populations; 3) conduct formative research with priority populations and key stakeholders to assess the EBIs' acceptability and to tailor EBIs to better meet priority population(s)' preferences and needs; and 4) implement and evaluate the multilevel intervention and make recommendations for future programs and policies in the state of Florida. This proposal makes three significant contributions to prevention research. First, the FPRC will work with FDOH, a community committee and other stakeholders (e.g., American Cancer Society) to test the CBPM for Systems Change framework's ability to select, tailor, promote, monitor, evaluate, and disseminate EBIs to reduce colorectal cancer screening (CRCS) health disparities. This planning framework has the potential to equip prevention researchers, health department and community partners with an effective planning framework that accelerates the translation of research to practice. Lessons learned from this demonstration project will be used to enhance the FPRC's training website and provide technical assistance to other State health departments and community partners. Second, the FPRC and its partners will create a computer simulation model of the system in which CRCS disparities are embedded and identify evidence-based interventions appropriate for addressing determinants at multiple levels in that system. This model and formative research results will be used to design an integrated, multilevel intervention for reducing CRC disparities.  The intervention will be evaluated and the feasibility of scaling it up to other communities assessed. A dissemination plan will be created for effective components. Third, the FPRC will use lessons learned from the new and previous demonstration projects to enhance the CBPM training website and mentor other public health agencies and community partners that adopt it."
"9565691","Project Summary Background Palliative care is known to improve patient outcomes and reduce health care utiliza- tion in patients with cancer. But we know little on how to deliver palliative care to the large and growing population of older patients with multiple chronic conditions. Palliative care clinicians are a scarce resource, so care must be targeted to the subset of patients who would benefit most: those at highest risk of near-term death. This is a major challenge outside of specific diseases with known trajectories. Clinicians struggle with prognosis, and current statistical models perform poorly. Aims We will use novel predictive modeling methods (`machine learning') to identify complex old- er patients at high risk of one-year mortality, drawing on our team's prior work in data analytics and machine learning. We will apply these methods to a diverse population of older patients with multi- ple chronic conditions, in a large academic primary care network. Building on our team's track rec- ord of successful clinical trials, we will conduct a randomized controlled trial of palliative care inte- grated with primary care, targeting older patients at the highest predicted risk of death. We will as- sess impact on a range of measurable patient-reported outcomes and health care utilization. Study design We will develop a model to predict one-year mortality in primary care patients over 65, using a rich set of variables from electronic health records. Our preliminary data indicate that machine learning models are highly accurate for predicting mortality out-of-sample, i.e., in patients the model has never seen. We will identify patients at the highest risk of death?who would benefit most from scarce palliative care resources?and approach them to participate in a randomized trial, comparing usual primary care to primary care integrated with palliative care. The intervention, a series of home-based visits by palliative care clinicians, will build a longitudinal relationship with the patient and primary care team. This strategy is designed specifically to meet the needs of older pa- tients, as well as busy primary care clinicians. We will power the study to detect changes in two primary outcomes: quality of life and care intensity, measured by hospital and emergency visits. Other outcomes include symptom burden, advanced care planning, hospice use, and mortality. Implications This project will generate the first evidence on a new model of palliative care for older adults with multiple chronic illnesses, delivered `upstream' in the disease trajectory. We will build the technical and clinical infrastructure needed to target palliative care interventions for older adults outside of specific disease-based programs. A successful trial would facilitate broader adop- tion of similar interventions for older adults, and fundamentally transform the scale and scope of palliative care efforts in this population."
"9363841","Project summary/Abstract Glaucoma is the second leading cause of blindness worldwide. The prevalence of this age-related disease is expected to increase substantially in coming years because of the aging population. Currently, the only clinically approved glaucoma intervention targets at lowering intraocular pressure (IOP). However, the exact roles of IOP elevation in glaucomatous pathogenesis remain unclear. In addition, glaucoma may continue to progress in some patients even after lowering IOP to normal levels, which indicates that additional key factors may be contributing to the disease. The goal of this project is to better understand glaucoma mechanisms by determining non-invasively and quantitatively the pathophysiological events and disease progression in the visual system using novel, multi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques in both human glaucoma patients and experimental glaucoma models. We will test the central hypothesis that glaucoma involves impairments of the brain's visual system apart from the eye. Furthermore, such impairments may be ameliorated by early neuroprotective treatments. We will investigate the structural, metabolic and functional brain changes longitudinally using the 3-Tesla human MRI scanner and the 9.4-Tesla animal MRI scanner, and relate brain MRI findings with glaucoma disease severity using retinal thickness measurements and visual outcome assessments. The project?s primary objective is to use the developed in vivo imaging model system to find out the structural-metabolic-functional brain relationships and eye-brain-behavior relationships in both humans and animal models of glaucoma for clinical and translational applications. This information will be valuable for identifying glaucoma mechanisms in the brain, monitoring glaucoma progression in the visual system, and guiding interventions to the visual system, in order to reduce the burden of this irreversible but preventable disease. The Specific Aims to be tested are as follows: Aim 1: To test the hypothesis that experimental glaucoma impairs the visual system and visuomotor behavior in rodents. We will elevate IOP to different levels and durations to determine their contributions to the structure, metabolism and function of the visual system. We will also determine whether oral choline supplements can ameliorate the neurobehavioral effects of experimental glaucoma on the visual system. Lastly, we will determine the specificity of glaucomatous damages to the visual system by comparing the neurobehavioral effects between experimental glaucoma and other retinal or optic nerve injuries over time. Aim 2: To test the hypothesis that vision loss in human glaucoma involves impairments of the visual system. Diffusion tensor MRI, proton MR spectroscopy and functional MRI at 3 Tesla will be used to determine the structural, metabolic and functional brain changes in glaucoma patients with different degrees of vision loss. The in vivo brain MRI measures will be compared with clinical assessments by optical coherence tomography of the retina and Humphrey visual field functional tests. The visual system in glaucoma will also be compared with healthy control brains and other retinal or optic nerve injuries."
"9523400","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this proposal is to advance an orally bioavailable first-in-class somatostatin receptor subtype-4 selective drug candidate with disease-modifying attributes for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The hit compound has been validated to enhance learning and memory in mouse models of AD and cognitive decline, with a reduction of beta-amyloid (Aß) oligomer levels within the brain. Our program has now advanced to lead optimization, which is accomplished through enhancement of drug-like properties of the lead series in tandem with well-defined advancement criteria, respective to modeling, in vitro screens and in vivo/ex vivo validation. This study will be accomplished via three specific aims. Based on outcomes within each aim, additional design adjustments and testing may be performed. Aim-1: Design and synthesis. Rational drug design strategies employing iterative in silico modeling, synthesis, and structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies will be conducted to enhance potency and selectivity, reduce potential toxicity, and enhance physiochemical properties for oral bioavailability. Synthetic methods will be further developed and applied to iterative and parallel medicinal chemistry where appropriate. Aim-2: In vitro screens. Using established in vitro methods, critical properties (i.e. solubility, receptor affinity and selectivity, activity, plasma binding, stability, permeability, and toxicity potential will be assessed in a sequential manner to delineate compound viability. Aim-3: In vivo/ex vivo assessments. Compounds meeting necessary criteria will be advanced to pharmacokinetic evaluations (i.v. and p.o.) for further delineation and identification of a primary lead. This lead will be tested via chronic p.o. administration in the 3xTg mouse model of AD at age-dependent intervals that coincide with critical periods of neuropathological development and learning/memory decline. Dosing range will be determined from pharmacokinetic data. Delineation of lead compound impact on learning and memory will be assessed via Morris water-maze, T-maze, and object recognition testing. Following final behavioral testing, cortical and hippocampal tissues will be evaluated to delineate changes in critical proteins/enzymes associated with AD pathology and proposed drug mechanism. This study will culminate in the advancement of a first-in-class AD drug candidate to the next stage of development. The aims of this study address priorities of National Institutes of Health, specific to drug discovery for nervous system disorders respective to drug-candidate lead optimization: FOA number: PAR-13-048."
"9330866","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Macrophage infiltrates play a variety of key roles in the immune defense system, including a central role in innate or natural immunity. We have shown by immunostaining using anti-F4/80 and CD11b antibodies that resident corneal macrophages are not detectable in cornea of uninfected mice. In contrast, following infection of mice with herpes simplex virus type-1 (HSV-1), macrophages appear to be the most dominant infiltrate of the eye. Thus, macrophages may play a central role in both exacerbation and control of acute and chronic HSV-1 infection. In line with our previous studies, our Preliminary studies also suggest that: 1. Injection of mice with macrophage-colony stimulating factor (M-CSF) DNA reduced virus replication in the eye and establishment of latency in trigeminal ganglia (TG) of ocularly infected mice. 2. Similar to M-CSF injection, injection of mice with IL-12p35 DNA also reduced virus replication in the eye and establishment of latency in TGs of latently infected mice.  Thus, since macrophages are the most abundant infiltrates in the eye of HSV-1 ocularly infected mice and also appear the fastest in the eye (as early as 4 hours) after ocular infection, we will use macrophage stimulatory factors (i.e., M-CSF and IL-12p35) to reduce virus replication in the eye and establishment of latency in the TGs of ocularly infected mice. We propose to:  Aim: Test the hypothesis that macrophage stimulation by a combination of IL-12p35 and M-CSF DNA as molecular adjuvants will enhance TH1/TC1 responses in the eye and lead to a more rapid clearance of virus from the eye and trigeminal ganglia (TG) during primary ocular HSV-1 infection. This will, lead to a significant reduction in establishment of latency and reactivation in TG of latently infected mice. Our preliminary studies suggest that administration of IL-12p35 and M-CSF DNA improves immunization efficacy as judged by a greater reduction in virus replication in the eye after ocular infection compare with control mice, or mice that are immunized with IL-12p35 or M-CSF alone. This improved efficacy correlated with higher activities of local ocular responses (i.e., IL-2, IFN-?, IFN-ß,  IFN- ?). We propose to test the hypothesis that; (1) a cocktail of IL-12p35 and M-CSF DNA will result in reduction in primary virus replication in the eyes as well as reduction of latency in TGs of infected mice; (2) these reductions are associated with generation of strong and rapid TH1/TC1 responses in addition to IFN-? and IFN-ß in the eye and TGs of infected mice; and (3) Co-administration of IL-12p35 + M-CSF + 5gP DNA will further reduce latency in immunized mice compared with mice that treated with 5gP alone. Overall, we expect to determine that a combination of IL-12p35 and M-CSF enhances the cytokine secretion and antigen presentation functions of macrophages rather than their phagocytosis function."
"9388253","Developing ASCL1 and NEUROD1 lineage oncogene targeted therapy for small cell lung cancer (SCLC) This application focuses on developing new targeted therapy for SCLC focusing on two key lineage oncogenes involved in SCLC pathogenesis and malignant behavior, ASCL1 and NEUROD1. Nearly 90% of SCLCs express ASCL1, NEUROD1 or both. In the preclinical models, including human SCLC lines and xenografts and genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs) of SCLC, tumors that express either ASCL1 or NEUROD1 appear ?addicted? to their expression and function. The presence of ASCL1 or NEUROD1 also are associated with expression of important downstream oncogenes and regulatory genes. If ASCL1/NEUROD1 are removed (through genetic knockdown) SCLCs undergo many logs of tumor cell kill. Using state of the art technology in human preclinical models, we propose to systematically study the dependency of a large number of SCLC lines and xenografts (including patient derived xenografts, PDXs, and circulating tumor cell derived xenografts, CDXs) on ASCL1 and NEUROD1 through genetic knockdown, and systematically test the ability of blocking genetically and pharmacologically downstream potentially ?druggable? targets of these two transcription factors to kill SCLCs. We have three specific aims: Aim 1. Determine ASCL1 and NEUROD1 expression patterns and clinical and molecular correlates in preclinical SCLC models and tumor specimens; Aim 2. Determine ASCL1 and NEUROD1 genetic dependency phenotypes, potential molecular biomarkers predicting response, and frequency and mechanisms of resistance in SCLC preclinical models; Aim 3. Determine the role of ASCL1 and NEUROD1 directly regulated ?downstream? targets as vulnerabilities that can be exploited for therapeutic effect using in vivo xenograft shRNA mini-library ?drop out? screens and selected drugs that inhibit downstream ?druggable? targets. As part of these aims we will also determine if resistance to ASCL1 or NEUROD1 targeted therapy in SCLCs develops using CRISPR-CAS9 technology including potential mechanisms of this resistance, and we will explore the possible use of ASCL1 and NEUROD1 expression as SCLC enrollment biomarkers for developing ?precision medicine? to predict the response of such targeted therapy in individual SCLCs. We have developed a large amount of preliminary data on which this application is based including 1) assembling the world?s largest collection of clinically and molecularly annotated human SCLC lines and xenografts, as well as important GEMMs of SCLC, 2) generating a comprehensive list of directly regulated downstream targets of ASCL1 and NEUROD1 through ChipSeq/RNASeq and chromatin landscape studies, and 3) developing experimental approaches to systematically study the dependency of SCLCs on ASCL1 and NEUORD1 downstream targets. We have assembled a world class team of investigators, including a patient advocate, with complementary skills to assure the successful completion of this project. The final deliverables will serve as the basis for new ASCL1 and NEUROD1 targeted therapeutics for SCLC."

"9361731","ABSTRACT  Research indicates that Marshallese (a Pacific Islander population from the Republic of the Marshall Islands) suffer from a significant and disproportionate burden of type 2 diabetes with rates ranging from 24% to 50%.1-4 This is ~400% higher than the general population.1-4 Researchers have noted inadequacies in existing interventions to address the health disparities related to diabetes in Marshallese and other Pacific Islander groups. Current interventions are limited in two ways: 1) interventions are not culturally relevant; and 2) the interventions focus primarily on individual-level motivations that are not likely to be persuasive within the highly collectivistic Pacific Islander cultures.22, 23 Our overall goal is to adapt, test, and disseminate an intervention that is effective at reducing the risk and impact of diabetes among Pacific Islander communities. This application uses a CBPR approach to culturally adapt, implement, and test the Healthy Bodies, Health Souls intervention in Marshallese churches. Healthy Bodies, Healthy Souls is a faith-based intervention originally developed for implementation in African American churches. Health Bodies, Healthy Souls uses a multilevel approach to primary and secondary diabetes prevention. The proposed research builds upon four years of CBPR with Marshallese living in northwest Arkansas.50-54 In phase one of the project, a transdisciplinary CBPR team of university researchers, community co-investigators and the broader Marshallese community will culturally adapt Healthy Bodies, Healthy Souls. The 22-week program addresses diabetes risk at multiple levels by focusing on individual, social, and organizational factors associated with sustained improvements in diet and physical activity. The team will use Bernal's eight dimensions of cultural sensitivity to guide the adaptation process. In phase two, we will implement and test the culturally-adapted program in Marshallese churches. The study will use a mixed-methods approach to evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, and effectiveness of the adapted intervention. We have two specific aims: Aim 1: Culturally adapt the Healthy Bodies, Healthy Souls intervention for delivery in Marshallese churches using a community-engaged approach and Bernal's cultural adaptation framework. Aim 2: Implement and test the culturally adapted intervention in Marshallese churches using methods of community-engaged research and a mixed methods approach to assess the program's feasibility, acceptability, and effectiveness. The study's findings will add to a very limited scientific knowledge base that informs work with Marshallese and other Pacific Islander communities. The study will generate pilot data to inform other areas with limited research including engaged research with communities that have a history of trauma;59-63 faith-based approaches to diabetes prevention;64 community- engaged cultural adaptation;38, 65-67 and multilevel approaches to diabetes prevention.31-36 The investigative team includes highly qualified academic and community co-investigators with complimentary areas of expertise that have demonstrated success conducting engaged research with Pacific Islanders."
"9448204","ABSTRACT The neuron is the basic cellular unit of the brain. For neurons to work properly, they must be plastic and constantly capable of changing in response to stimuli, forming and stabilizing new connections. This process requires proteins to be added to the new synaptic contact, and this in turn results from the targeting of mRNA to these sites of activity. This is the mechanistic basis of learning and memory since the synapse is stabilized by the production of proteins in response to stimulation that are important for its structural integrity. How this mRNA is regulated in neurons to make the right protein at the right place and time has been the subject of our investigations over the years of this funding. This proposal exploits the tools we generated during the last funding period to address how mRNA is regulated in dendrites. One of these tools is a mouse where we have tagged the ?-actin gene with a fluorescent marker to follow individual mRNAs in live neurons. We have found that the mRNA is encased in an inert form as it travels around in the dendrite. When it comes into the proximity of a stimulated dendritic spine, it unfurls its RNA payload and makes a burst of protein, but then returns to a dormant state after 16 minutes. The mRNA sits at the place where it was last stimulated for hours, awaiting the next signal, wherein it will initiate another round of proteins. In this way, the synaptic contact is built up, consistent with a learning and memory paradigm that relies on repetitive stimulation. If there are no further activating signals, the mRNA continues its search, moving in short processive movements broken by periods of diffusion. The current proposal follows up on the discovery of the particular protein that binds to the mRNA zipcode responsible for directing it to its site (zipcode binding protein, ZBP1), anchors the mRNA at the site of stimulation. The model we have constructed suggests that the mRNA translates upon a further stimulation and we intend to focus on this point of regulation by describing the kinetics of these events and the proteins that play a role in these events. Up to this point we have investigated ?-actin mRNA because actin is the major structural protein in cells, and in the synapse as well. However the regulatory mechanism leading to a complex structure such as a synapse must orchestrate the expression of many proteins. For this reason, we have constructed another mouse with an mRNA important for learning, Arc, that has been tagged with a different fluorescent marker. In this proposal, we will characterize the mRNAs for ?-actin and Arc in mice together where both mRNAs are individually detectable by different colored fluorochromes. We propose eventually a third hybrid-color mRNA for CaMKII?, an essential protein in synapses. Our goal is to uncover the mechanisms that govern the regulation of different mRNAs in response to stimulatory activations of the neuron: the timing of their synthesis, localization into dendrites to activated spines, their translational repression, activation and eventual degradation, and some proteins associated with each of these events. The tools are now in place to characterize each of these steps at the single molecule level in live neurons."
"9324720","Project Summary There is growing evidence that myelin, the insulating sheath enveloping axons and enabling rapid information transmission throughout the mammalian brain, may undergo dynamic changes throughout the course of adult life. These changes may be adaptive, and may play an underappreciated role in normal processes of learning and memory. Currently, the mechanisms underlying adaptive myelination are unclear. Intriguingly, the proliferation rate of oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs), the resident stem cells in the brain that differentiate to form myelinating oligodendrocytes, in mice is regulated by neuronal activity, suggesting that communication between neurons and OPCs may mediate adaptive myelin change. A leading candidate for the mode of this communication is neuron-OPC synaptic communication, which has been described in rodents but whose role remains unclear. We have recently found that neuroligin 3 ? a key regulator of neuronal synaptic function ? is highly expressed in OPCs. In this proposal, we intend to shed light on how neuroligin 3 may contribute to adaptive myelination. Understanding mechanisms behind neural activity-induced OPC proliferation is of critical importance in human disease as well, given that many human neural cancers are thought to derive from oligodendrocyte-lineage cells and that selective oligodendrocyte depletion is a hallmark of a range of white matter diseases. In our first aim, we will assess whether neuroligin 3 expression in OPCs is required for myelination. This will be the first cell-specific investigation of the role of a synaptic regulatory protein in white matter development in vivo. In our second aim, we will examine whether deletion of neuroligin 3 in OPCs impacts neuron-OPC synaptic communication, the first study of synaptic regulation at neuron-OPC synapses. In our final aim, we will employ optogenetics ? a technology enabling activation of genetically-defined ensembles of neurons in freely behaving animals ? to determine whether neuroligin 3 is required for neuronal activity-induced adaptive myelination. Taken together, this proposal will enable groundbreaking studies of a leading hypothesized mechanism for neuron-OPC communication that could modulate OPC proliferation and contribute to adaptive myelination. Understanding these mechanisms is likely to prove critical for building our knowledge of how neuron-OPC interactions contribute to learning and memory, development of brain tumors, and pathogenesis and potential therapeutic interventions in white matter disease."
"9427377","PROJECT SUMMARY  The Alzheimer?s Disease Sequencing Project (ADSP) is a national sequencing initiative focused on identifying genetic risk and protective factors for Alzheimer?s Disease (AD) in an effort to identify new pathways for prevention and new targets for drug development. The projects? discovery phase included whole exome sequencing (WES) of 10,914 unrelated cases (N=5,778) and controls (N=5,136) and whole genome sequencing (WGS) of 1,019 familial samples. A majority of these samples are non-Hispanic white (NHW) in origin, making the addition of ethnically diverse samples to the study critical to identification of both shared and novel genetic risk factors for AD between populations. This ethnic diversity was emphasized in the ?ADSP Follow-Up Study (FUS) Phase? planning stage with a directive that additional existing cohorts with unrelated AD cases that ?encompass the richest possible ethnic diversity? be given the highest priority for inclusion.  To fulfill the goals of this RFA and this FUS Phase Mandate, this proposal identifies seven existing elderly cohorts of African-American (AA) and pan-HI ancestry with a total of 10,430 samples (N=2,322 AA AD cases and 1,843 AA controls and 2,928 Hispanic AD cases and 2,875 Hispanic controls) for WGS and processing in collaboration with existing NIH-funded AD infrastructure. Combining these cohorts with existing African America (AA) and Hispanic (HI) sequencing from the Washington Heights-Hamilton Heights-Inwood Community Aging Project (WHICAP), the Alzheimer?s Disease Genetics Consortium (ADGC) and the ADSP will provide large ethnically diverse datasets for both validation of ADSP discovery phase findings and discovery of novel risk and/or protective variants for AD. Importantly, these data will allow for admixture mapping, a powerful method of gene mapping for diseases that show differential risk by ancestry, by comparing allele frequency differences between populations. They will also become an invaluable resource for the AD research community at-large, and will help to address the health disparities that contribute to AA and HI populations having higher rates of AD than NHW. Thus, we will address these important issues by creating a large dataset of AA and pan-HI AD cases and controls for study.  Specifically we propose to: 1) increase the ethnic diversity of the ADSP by assembling samples from existing cohorts with AA and HI AD cases and controls; 2) collaborate with the National Cell Repository for Alzheimer?s Disease (NCRAD) in assemblage, storage, and distribution of DNA on these cohorts; 3) generating genome-wide SNP array data and WGS for all collected samples; and 4) collaborate with the NIA Genetics of Alzheimer?s Disease Data Storage Site (NIAGADS) and The Genome Center for Alzheimer?s Disease (GCAD) in processing, quality controls, storage and distribution of the final datasets. Our overall goal is to enhance the discovery of AD risk factors by facilitating research on AD in ethnically diverse datasets."
"9448571","PROJECT SUMMARY Intestinal helminth parasites infect billions worldwide. Mammalian hosts mount a Type 2 inflammatory response to infection, which is characterized by immune cell activation and intestinal epithelial cell mucus secretion that lead to worm expulsion but can also cause pathological excess mucus production. Previous work has focused on how host-derived proteins called cytokines control Type 2 inflammation, but other factors such as the lipid prostaglandin D2 (PGD2) are also produced during infection. PGD2 promotes Type 2 allergic lung inflammation by binding to CRTH2 (chemoattractant receptor-homologous molecule expressed on Th2 cells). However, how the PGD2-CRTH2 pathway interacts with cytokines to regulate Type 2 inflammation during intestinal helminth infection is unclear. Our preliminary studies revealed that following infection with the helminth Nippostrongylus brasiliensis, CRTH2-deficient mice had decreased Type 2 immune activation compared to controls, but surprisingly also had increased epithelial mucin responses and accelerated worm clearance. This phenotype was also observed in infected bone marrow chimeric mice in which only non- hematopoietic cells lacked CRTH2, suggesting that the PGD2-CRTH2 pathway suppresses intestinal epithelial cell mucus responses. Notably, how PGD2 production is regulated is unclear. The epithelial cell-derived cytokine interleukin (IL)-33, which activates immune cells during helminth infection, elicits PGD2 production from mast cells in vitro. Thus, IL-33 may activate the PGD2-CRTH2 pathway in vivo. Our preliminary studies showed that following IL-33 treatment, CRTH2-deficient mice had impaired population expansion of IL-33- responsive group 2 innate lymphoid cells compared to controls, suggesting that optimal responses to IL-33 in vivo require CRTH2. Together, these data provoke the central hypothesis that during helminth infection, IL-33 activates the PGD2-CRTH2 pathway to balance Type 2 inflammatory responses, expelling worms efficiently while limiting pathology. To test this hypothesis, we propose 2 Specific Aims. Aim 1 will test if PGD2 acts directly on small intestinal epithelial cells to inhibit mucin production during Type 2 inflammation, dependent on CRTH2, using small intestinal organoid cultures and a new mouse model that allows for deletion of CRTH2 only in intestinal epithelial cells. Aim 2 will test how IL-33 regulates PGD2 production by mast cells to shape immune responses during Type 2 inflammation, using gain- and loss-of-function experiments, adoptive transfer approaches, and bone marrow chimeric mice coupled with N. brasiliensis infection. These data will support the generation of a new paradigm of helminth-induced Type 2 intestinal inflammation that incorporates the effects of PGD2 and CRTH2, and will inform the development and use of drugs that target the PGD2-CRTH2 pathway to treat diseases associated with Type 2 inflammation."
"9316249","Project Description This proposal aims to linearize, immobilize and perform super-resolution imaging of native chromatin fibers using a platform of elastomeric nanochannels. The immediate biological goal is to track the transmission of histones during DNA replication and the redistribution of histone modifications during transcription activation, revealing how epigenetic information is coordinated on individual chromatin fibers.  Conventional nanochannels, while capable of linearizing DNA and chromatin, do not allow super-resolution imaging due to mobility of the biopolymers within the channels. This proposal will overcome this key limitation by using completely collapsible elastomeric nanochannels to not only linearize chromatin but also immobilize it. The required nanochannels will be fabricated by guided fracture of elastomer-sandwiched brittle thin films. The ?tunable? channels are opened to enable efficient loading of the relatively large chromatin in their coiled states. Then the channels are gradually closed in several steps. The combined hydrodynamic flow and confinement within the nanochannel linearize and immobilize individual chromatin fibers, which will be imaged and mapped with super-resolution optical microscopy. The process can be reversed and repeated, allowing the same chromatin fiber to be examined multiple times. This will not only improve confidence of the chromatin status revealed, but also enable us to study various epigenetic marks, particularly histone modifications, on the same chromatin fiber. For biology, we will focus on Tetrahymena rDNA mini-chromosome, which can also be engineered as a high copy number expression vector. Its size (~20 kb) is optimal for linearization in nanochannels. Labelling with fluorescent proteins or antibodies coupled with fluorescent dyes enables optical differentiation of old and new histones, as well as various histone modifications. This will allow direct visualization of how histones are transmitted during DNA replication. We will also examine redistribution of various histone modifications accompanying transcription activation. Importantly, we will be able to directly examine the status of histones and histone modifications in nucleosomes discretely positioned in individual chromatin fibers. This will reveal the connectivity or coordination between different epigenetic marks. The aims of this project are: Aim 1. Computational analysis of fabrication and operation of normally-closed tunable nanochannels Aim 2. Construction of straining system, and optimization of chromatin linearization and imaging Aim 3. Analysis of histones and histone modifications on individual chromatin fibers We will examine the  inheritance of old histones during DNA replication, in normal as well as replicative stress conditions. We will also analyse the redistribution of histone variants and histone modifications, upon induction of transcription activation or silencing. These studies will be extended to mutants deficient in epigenetic pathways, as well as in pharmacologically perturbed cells."

The UCSF Brain Health Assessment was developed to efficiently measure the cognitive domains that can be affected in the earliest stages of neurocognitive decline, including memory, executive functions / speed, visuospatial skills, language, behavior, and function. Four subtests and an optional informant survey are administered via an appealing tablet interface and with automated scoring and provider feedback. Preliminary validation studies indicate excellent combined sensitivity and specificity to cognitive impairment among English-speaking older adults with moderate to high levels of education. The primary goals of the proposed work are to optimize and validate the BHA for older adults who are diverse in terms of education and language spoken, to perform cross-validation studies of other paradigms funded by this award, and to evaluate and address barriers to detecting cognitive impairment in primary care. Education and English as a second language each impact cognitive test performance and are barriers to accurate detection of cognitive impairment. This project will address these health disparities by including persons with diverse levels of education and persons whose primary language is Spanish, Mandarin, or Cantonese in both validation and implementation studies. In Aim 1, we will evaluate the validity of the BHA for the detection of cognitive impairment in well-characterized and expertly diagnosed English-speaking older adults with low, moderate, or high education. In Aim 2, we will evaluate the validity of the BHA for the detection of cognitive impairment in well-characterized and expertly diagnosed Spanish-, Cantonese-, or Mandarin-speaking older adults. In Aim 3, we will identify and address implementation challenges in primary care practices that serve patients diverse in terms of education and language spoken. If successful, this project will lead to increased detection of cognitive impairment in everyday community settings, which is essential to enable differential diagnosis and to improve medical management for people with cognitive impairment, including dementia, in the United States."
"9301253","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT: Microglia are resident myeloid-lineage cells in both the CNS and in the eye and function in the maintenance of normal tissue. Retinal microglia can become activated and/or dysregulated during disease, and thus affect disease progression in retinitis pigmentosa. Understanding the biology of microglia is a challenge due to absence of markers and molecular microglia signatures. Recently, we identified a homeostatic molecular microglia signature which provides new tools for investigating retinal microglial biology and the possibility of targeting retinal microglia for the treatment of retinitis pigmentosa.  Using our new microglial markers, we investigated microglia in the rd1 murine models of RP. We found increased numbers of resident microglia but no infiltration of monocytes in the retinal. Most importantly, we found that intravitreal transfer of microglia from animals with RP into normal animals, resulted in photoreceptor loss. Consistent with this, intravitreal transfer of retinal microglia from normal animals into animals with RP reduced photoreceptors loss. We hypothesize that in RP, microglia proliferate and acquire a cytotoxic phenotype mediated by intrinsic activation of the TREM2-APOE pathway which suppresses microglia homeostatic molecular properties and leads to uncontrolled chronic inflammation and photoreceptors damage. Treatments aimed to target microglia by suppressing the TREM2-APOE pathway is associated with activation of both the TGF? pathway and MERTK which abrogates the inflammatory microglial phenotype and restores retinal microglial homeostatic properties. This provides a new direction for studying RP and development of novel therapies that target microglia. We believe that an innovative feature of our approach is that it is a mutation- independent approach that applies to RP independent of the genetic mutation. In addition, there is a translational aspect to the proposed work as we will investigate human eyes with our recently described microglial antibodies. We will address the following specific aims: Aim 1. Identify molecular pathways affected in retinal microglia in mouse models and human RP. Aim 2. Target the TREM2-APOE-SPP1 pathway to inhibit MGnD-cytotoxic microglia in rd mice. Aim 3. Restore M0-homeostatic microglia via TGF?1-MERTK signaling in rd mice.  "
"9237767","Abstract  Chronic exposure of environmental arsenic promotes skin, bladder, liver and lung cancers. However, the mechanism underlying arsenic lung carcinogenesis is unclear. Evidence from animal models and studies in cancer patients indicate that the immune system monitors the host body recognizing and reacting against newly arising transformed/tumor cells to stop/control tumor formation. The encounter between the immune system and transformed/tumor cells initiates a process termed ?immunoediting? that can bring about three outcomes: elimination, equilibrium or escape of transformed/tumor cells from immune control. Host immunity suppresses tumor development, whereas tumor formation implies the successful escape of transformed/tumor cells from the surveillance of the immune system. Effector T cells, particularly cytotoxic T (Tc) cells, represent a major component of cell-mediated anti-tumor immunity. One of the mechanisms modulating T cell antitumor effector function involves the activation/inhibition receptors on a T cell membrane. Inhibition of T cell antitumor function through the activation of immune checkpoint pathways (e.g. PD-1/PD-L1 pathway) has been shown to promote tumor cell immune escape and tumor formation. In addition, previous reports indicate that the aberrant activation of STAT3 occurs in many human tumors and STAT3-mediated PD-L1 up-regulation impedes T cell antitumor function. Our previous in vitro study showed that the IL-6/STAT3 axis plays a critical role in arsenic- induced transformation in human bronchial epithelial cells. Using a lung tumor mouse model, our new preliminary data show that long-term arsenic exposure increased lung tumor incidence rate and multiplicity of A/J mice. In addition, arsenic exposure dose-dependently activated STAT3, increased the binding of STAT3 to the promoter of the PD-L1 gene and up-regulated PD-L1 in mouse lungs. Flow cytometry data further indicated that arsenic increased PD-1+ T cell numbers and decreased CD8+/CD4+ T cell ratio in the lungs, while injection of PD-1 or PD-L1 antibodies reversed the decreased CD8+/CD4+ ratio. Since PD-1/PD-L1 up-regulation may inhibit T cell antitumor function and promote escape of transformed cells from host immunosurveillance and eventually lead to tumor formation, we hypothesize that arsenic promotes lung tumor formation through STAT3/PD-1/PD-L1-mediated inhibition of T cell antitumor function. Three specific aims are proposed: Aim 1: To determine if chronic arsenic exposure inhibits T cell antitumor function and the types of cells in which PD-1 or PD-L1 is up-regulated by arsenic in the lungs of A/J mice. Aim 2: To determine if inhibition of the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway ameliorates arsenic-promoted T cell dysfunction and tumor formation in the lungs of A/J mice. Aim 3: To determine if activation of STAT3 is the mechanism underlying arsenic-enhanced PD-L1 up- regulation, T cell dysfunction and tumor formation in the lungs of A/J mice."
"9309410","Exfoliation syndrome (XFS) is a common condition that causes high-tension open-angle glaucoma (XFG), pre- mature cataract formation, and complications during cataract surgery. Evidence suggests that XFS/XFG is genetically complex. LOXL1 is a major genetic risk factor for XFS/XFG, with LOXL1 variants occurring in up to 98% of patients. However, these same variants are also present in up to 80% of unaffected individuals, indicating that additional genetic and/or environmental factors are necessary for disease development. Our goal is to comprehensively define risk factors (both genetic and environmental) for XFS/XFG, which will facilitate effective screening and prevention strategies and the development of novel therapies. In the previous funding period, using data from large ongoing prospective cohorts of Nurses' Health Study (NHS) and Health Professionals Follow-up Study (HPFS), we have identified major environmental exposures significantly influencing the risk of XFS/XFG including time spent outdoors, heavy coffee consumption and low dietary folate intake (related to elevated homocysteine). Using a case control sample from Mass Eye and Ear, we have assessed the contributions of CLU variants to XFS/XFG and have contributed to an international study identifying CACNA1A as a novel genetic risk factor. From 7 different US sites, we have collected DNA samples for 1241 XFS/XFG cases and genome-wide genotyping for both common and rare SNPs has been completed at CIDR. In NHS and HPFS, we project to have incident 600 cases of XFS/XFG among 100,000+ participants followed prospectively for 30+ years. For the next funding period, we propose the following specific aims: 1) complete genetic analyses to identify new genetic risk factors for XFS/XFG, including contributions of rare variants and explore complex genetic interactions; 2) investigate the role of environmental exposures related to homocysteine (DASH dietary pattern) and UV light exposure and explore interactions with LOXL1, and 3) complete the first pre-diagnostic metabolomic analysis for XFS/XFG focusing on metabolites related to homocysteine and folate and interactions for individual metabolites with LOXL1. This proposed research is significant because it is expected to advance and expand our understanding of the genetic etiology of XFS/XFG as it will leverage data from a large case/control study for genetic analyses and will be the first study of copy number variants and rare variants for this condition. The project is innovative in using prospectively collected environmental exposure data and pre-diagnostic serum for metabolomic studies in NHS/HPFS, to investigate factors present in cases prior to disease development. Overall these studies will advance our understanding of the predispoing events that could be therapeutic targets and biomarkers of disease risk."
"9419743","The advancement of research into effective medical treatments that counteract the toxic effects of chemical warfare nerve agent (CWNA) poisoning is heavily dependent on the use of animal models that accurately predict toxicity in humans. Rodents, which are commonly used as small animal models in toxicity research, offer the main benefit of relatively inexpensive in vivo screening of potential countermeasures compared to larger animals and are commonly used in medical chemical defense studies. However, the presence of plasma carboxylesterase activity in rats and mice confounds toxicity reports due to the role that the enzyme has in the detoxification of organophosphorous (OP) compounds. The recently developed carboxylesterase knockout (CaE KO) mouse model may more closely resemble human OP toxicity compared to wildtype mice. However, a comprehensive characterization of the acute and chronic toxic effects of CWNA exposure and medical countermeasures in this innovative animal model is still lacking. A hallmark of CWNA exposure is the onset of status epilepticus (SE), a prolonged seizure that, if uncontrolled, leads to benzodiazepine-resistant SE, and can lead to extensive neuronal damage, cognitive impairment, and epilepsy in animal models. In civilian populations, delayed anticonvulsant treatment is highly likely and currently there are no drugs approved for the delayed treatment of CWNA-induced SE. This project will determine the validity of using the CaE KO mouse as a model to evaluate treatment efficacy against benzodiazepine-resistant OP-induced seizures. The primary objectives are to: 1) characterize the efficacy of the treatment model using the antimuscarinic atropine sulfate and the acetylcholinesterase reactivator HI-6 to increase survival and the anticonvulsant midazolam in the CaE KO mouse model of soman (GD)-exposure when the midazolam treatment is delayed (Specific Aim 1); 2) validate the CaE KO mouse as a model to screen innovative delayed treatments by testing medical countermeasures that are effective in reducing seizure activity and neuropathology in a rat model of GD toxicity (Specific Aim 2); and 3) evaluate in the CaE KO mouse the efficacy of a novel delayed treatment against the acute and long-term effects of GD exposure (Specific Aim 2). This study provides the quantitative characterization of the effectiveness of delayed midazolam treatment in a mouse model that more closely models human OP toxicity, so that the outcome (i.e. seizure activity, behavioral consequences, epileptogenesis and neuropathology) of delayed midazolam can be compared with the addition of novel adjunct medical countermeasures."
"9315501","Project Summary/Abstract Declining mobility function is a common age-related phenomenon that is associated with reduced quality of life and high societal costs. Recently, the brain's critical role in mobility function has been recognized using imaging approaches assessing white matter characteristics. A new paradigm considering the brain as a complex network uses MRI to directly characterize the brain as a functional network. Brain Networks and Mobility Function: B-NET brings together national leaders in brain network science, neurology and mobility assessment to apply this innovative network paradigm to elucidate the aging brain's role in declining mobility. We propose that functional connectivity within and between the sensorimotor cortex -- community structure (SMC-CS) -- predicts declining mobility; and that SMC-CS will be associated with mobility independent of known relationships between white matter integrity and mobility function. B-Net will establish a cohort of 240 community-dwelling older adults (age range 70-85) and measure mobility function at baseline, 6, 18 and 30 months using the extended short physical performance battery (eSPPB). The MRI will be repeated at 30 months. B-Net's specific aims are to: Specific Aim 1. Determine the baseline association between SMC-CS and eSPPB score. We hypothesize that SMC-CS will be associated with eSPPB performance independent of known correlates of mobility function and white matter integrity (i.e. fractional anisotropy and white matter lesions). Specific Aim 2. Determine whether baseline SMC-CS predicts mobility decline. We hypothesize that poorer baseline SMC-CS will be predict declining eSPPB scores after accounting for known correlates of mobility impairment including white matter integrity, cardiovascular fitness, and muscle strength. Specific Aim 3. Repeat brain MRI imaging to determine the longitudinal association between changes in SMC-CS and changes in eSPPB score. We hypothesize that longitudinal declines in SMC-CS will be significantly associated with declining eSPPB performance independent of known correlates of lower extremity function decline and white matter integrity. B-NET tests a novel emerging paradigm regarding the CNS's role in age-related functional decline to support the development of innovative strategies to sustain mobility function in older adults, a critical public health need."
"9426075","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Influenza A viruses (IAV) kill most of the cell types in which they replicate, both in cell culture and in infected lungs in vivo. While regulated cell death represents a host defense mechanism that limits both virus spread and host immunopathology early in an infection, unbridled cell death, particularly necrosis, can lead to severe degradation of bronchioalveolar epithelia and consequent mortality despite control of virus replication in vivo. Indeed, severe illness following infection with highly pathogenic strains of IAV is well-correlated with widespread pulmonary epithelial cell death and bronchioalveolar tissue damage in humans. Despite this, remarkably little is known of the molecular mechanisms by which IAV activates cell death in relevant lung cell types. Thus (1) understanding the mechanisms by which IAV triggers cell death, (2) determining the identity and importance of lung cell types that die by these mechanisms during IAV infection in vivo; and (3) determining if pharmacological manipulation of cell death represents a new therapeutic entry-point for respiratory IAV are each important unmet objectives. We have recently discovered a mechanism of cell death that appears to account for almost all IAV- activated death in infected airway epithelial cells. This pathway is initiated when the protein DAI senses IAV genomic RNA and nucleates the kinase RIPK3. RIPK3 then activates parallel pathways of programmed necrosis (necroptosis), as well as apoptosis. Necroptosis downstream of RIPK3 relies on MLKL and apoptosis on FADD, such that deletion of DAI, RIPK3, or MLKL+FADD renders mice extraordinarily susceptible to respiratory IAV replication and lethality. Remarkably, eliminating MLKL alone has no discernible effect, demonstrating that the FADD apoptosis axis can fully compensate for loss of MLKL and necroptosis. To our knowledge, these findings represent the first description of a dedicated IAV activated cell death pathway, the first implication of DAI as a sensor of RNA viruses, and the first identification of a virus that triggers both apoptosis and necroptosis downstream of RIPK3. The redundancy of necroptosis with apoptosis to IAV clearance also provides an unexpected therapeutic opportunity in cases where necrotic death is implicated in IAV pathogenesis. Based on these and other observations, the goals of this proposal are to: (1) identify the molecular mechanisms by which the DAI-RIPK3 axis recognizes IAV and activates cell death; (2) employ cutting-edge mouse reporter models to isolate and identify lung cell types that succumb to IAV by RIPK3-driven apoptosis versus necroptosis, and determine in which of these cell types is RIPK3 signaling important for virus control; and (3) test if selective blockade of necroptosis will have clinical benefit following infection with highly-pathogenic strains of IAV. Successful completion of these Aims has the potential to transform our understanding of IAV pathogenesis, with immediate clinical ramifications."
"9360565","PROJECT SUMMARY  The dentate gyrus (DG) is a subfield of the hippocampus that has been implicated in multiple psychiatric diseases, including schizophrenia. Functions of the DG include pattern separation, novelty detection, and the expression of innate anxiety, which have all been disrupted in patients with schizophrenia and in schizophrenia mouse models. While neuromodulators including dopamine are thought to be involved in the pathogenesis of hippocampal dysfunction in schizophrenia, the biological mechanisms that underlie defects in DG-dependent behaviors in schizophrenia are unknown.  Most studies of DG function and its role in disease have examined the DG principal cells, granule cells (GCs), and their unique ability to undergo adult neurogenesis. The DG also contains a second population of excitatory neurons called mossy cells (MCs), which have unique anatomical properties and extensive hippocampal connections that position them to modulate DG activity and affect behavior. They have also recently been linked to schizophrenia, in which the schizophrenia-associated protein dysbindin-1 localized to MCs. The involvement of MCs in schizophrenia may be tied to dopamine, as they are the only hippocampal neurons to express the dopamine D2 receptor subtype, and dopamine was recently shown to have a prolonged excitatory effect on them. This is significant in light of the fact that antipsychotics act at the D2 receptor and produce hippocampal changes, suggesting that these changes may be mediated by MCs.  Despite recent evidence that MCs contribute to clinically relevant DG functions and are involved in psychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia, so far there has been a lack of studies directly examining their role in DG circuitry and in behavior. This proposal will utilize a recently developed Cre-transgenic mouse line in combination with Cre-dependent viral vectors to answer a number of outstanding questions about dopamine inputs to MCs, the role of MCs in the DG circuit, and the link between MCs, dopamine, and behaviors that are dysfunctional in disorders, particularly schizophrenia. The first aim will use a modified rabies virus in MC- selective Drd2-Cre mice to perform monosynaptic retrograde tracing to specifically identify monosynaptic inputs to MCs, especially dopaminergic and neuromodulatory projections. Aim 2 will employ specific optogenetic activation and silencing of MCs in hippocampal slices of Drd2-Cre mice to determine the effect of MC activity on GC output, and the influence of dopamine on the MC ? GC synapse. The third aim will utilize DREADD-mediated silencing of MCs in Drd2-Cre mice in vivo, and probe the resulting effects on DG-linked behaviors that are influenced by dopamine and are impaired in schizophrenia. Overall, this research will greatly enhance our understanding of MC anatomy and function at both a circuit and behavioral level, and will help elucidate the role of MCs, dopamine, and DG dysfunction in the pathogenesis of disorders like schizophrenia."
"9217487","PROJECT SUMMARY Membrane fission is associated with the breakage of a tiny nanometer-scale membrane neck connecting two separating/dividing membrane compartments at the late stages of division. Severing this neck in a timely and leakage-free manner is critical for normal functioning of endomembrane systems, hence membrane fission is performed by specialized and tightly-regulated protein machinery assembling on the neck. While our current mechanistic understanding of fission, in life and disease, is heavily based upon in vitro reconstitution approaches, such approaches rarely (if at all) reproduce confined and crowded environment of the neck. Instead, in vitro reconstitution has been mostly performed using large (sub-micron to micron scale) membrane templates of various physico-chemical properties, resulting in controversial outcomes and precluding rigorous mechanistic analysis of fission. This project is focused on creation of the next- generation in vitro approaches that reconstruct and quantify membrane fission at physiological length/time scales. We will combine nanotechnology with modern biophysical approaches and protein engineering to solve the long-standing puzzle of membrane fission mediated by the proteins of dynamin superfamily, which are intimately involved in intracellular fusion/fission and directly linked to various human pathologies. We will approach this problem from several different angles:  - We will perform single-molecule analysis of dynamin oligomerization on membrane surfaces with  precisely (2 nm) calibrated curvature (10-1 to 10-2 nm range) to identify and characterize  elementary mechano-chemical units assembled by dynamin. We will determine (i) the  pathways of dynamin oligomerization/self-assembly on a curved membrane surface, (ii) the  size/geometrical arrangement of minimal oligomers capable of cooperative GTP hydrolysis and (iii)  the effects of membrane curvature on self-assembly and GTPase activity of small dynamin oligomers.  - We will assess membrane activity of individual dynamin oligomers (dimers and higher order  multimers) at nano-confined membrane templates to determine how the force fields  produced by dynamin are coupled to lipid rearrangements throughout fission. We will  (i) measure the local forces produced by different dynamin oligomers and quantify associated  membrane deformations and instabilities, and (ii) determine pathway(s) of lipid rearrangements and  their dependence on the size/geometry of dynamin complexes and geometrical/mechanical  parameters of membrane templates.  - We will analyze effects of auxiliary proteins and critical mutations of dynamins, compare the self-  assembly and fission pathways for different members of dynamin superfamily to distinguish  general and protein-specific parameters (perhaps, even specific pathways) of  membrane fission and unravel molecular mechanisms behind functional evolution  and regulation of dynamin fission machinery."
"9434895","Project summary/Abstract Cardiovascular disease is a leading cause of death globally. In vitro engineering of replacement blood vessels has emerged as a promising area of research that has the potential to provide lifesaving therapy in patients where autologous bypass grafts are not possible. The challenges of vascular tissue engineering require the developing samples to be monitored at regular intervals, however conventional assessment techniques are slow, laborious and destructive. The goal of this proposal is to realize and validate a multimodal optical imaging platform that uses a single flexible fiber optic interface to acquire non-destructive measurements on-demand from the luminal surface of vascular constructs developing inside a bioreactor. The platform is designed such that three independent but complimentary imaging modalities will be able to operate in parallel, these include fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIm) for monitoring changes in construct biochemistry; optical coherence tomography (OCT) for monitoring construct morphology and microstructure; and steady state fluorescence imaging (SSFI) to track the proliferation of green fluorescent protein labeled endothelial cells across the luminal surface. The specific aims of this proposal are as follows: (1) To realize a multimodal imaging platform compatible with non-destructive in vitro assessment of the luminal surface regions of vascular constructs inside a bioreactor; (2) To validate the performance of the multimodal imaging platform using tissue phantoms and engineered vascular constructs. The significance of this proposal is it presents an opportunity for a paradigm shift in the assessment of engineered tissue, where conventional destructive techniques are supplanted with faster, non- destructive ones. The innovation of this proposal is that it will allow FLIm, OCT and SSFI to operate in parallel, using the same double-clad fiber interface to guide light to and from the sample. The successful completion of this work has the potential for significant impact in the field of regenerative medicine where supplanting destructive measurements for non-destructive ones will lower costs and allow for faster prototyping of novel biomaterials."
"9357514","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Patients with advanced cancer face challenges affecting quality of life (QOL). As the National Cancer Policy Board has identified, research addressing the needs of patients with incurable cancers is severely deficient and effectiveness has rarely been displayed by prospective trials. Malignant bowel obstruction (MBO) is a common problem for advanced cancer patients that involves considerable suffering. There are two major treatment approaches for MBO: surgical management and medical management with specific classes of medications. There is little evidence-based information to choose the optimal clinical care for most patients with a MBO. Goals for these patients may include the ability to eat, relief of nausea, pain control, being at home, and along with an increase in survival. Treatments may improve QOL outcomes in many, but there is no consistent measure defining improvement. The aim of this study is to compare the current treatment algorithms of surgical and non-surgical approaches to MBO in terms of minimizing days in hospital and improving QOL. This will be a five-year multi-site prospective comparative effectiveness study of patients who are admitted to the hospital with an MBO. We have devised a mixed-design study of a smaller randomized population and a larger observational cohort to ensure validity of observational results while enabling adequate accrual. To accomplish this goal we will need to accrue 180 patients (50 in randomized sub-study, 130 in observational study). The preponderance of MBO patients will be accrued to be prospectively followed utilizing general modeling strategy along with propensity score techniques to compare treatment approaches. In addition, we will have a smaller subset of patients who will be randomized to surgical versus non-surgical interventions. Our data collection strategies are designed to minimize patient burden by this alternate research approach with clinically meaningful outcome measures as well as limited health-related quality of life surveys. The primary inclusion criteria for the study are whether a surgical option is being considered in the setting of MBO and there is equipoise to outcomes. The interventions to be compared are an initial surgical versus a non-surgical approach for MBO. Data forms will include demographic and disease history, hospital stay, days with NG tubes, TPN and other hydration, ability to eat or drink with dietary histories, complications, recurrence, total hospital days, and survival. In addition, research coordinators will serially acquire subjective QOL data from the MD Anderson Symptom Inventory - Gastrointestinal, which should not take more than 10 minutes to complete. The primary outcome measure will be good days, defined as being at home (out of the hospital) and alive. The difference we hope to find is two weeks in a 90 day span (20% difference). Secondary endpoints include days with NG tube, days of intravenous hydration, days eating solid foods, days drinking, and amount of intake, recurrence, morbidity, and survival. We will include a cost analysis plan as well. We anticipate results to be clinically useful to practitioners caring for MB patients."

Individuals with SMI die 25 years earlier, on average, than the general population and are designated a health disparity population by the National Association of State Mental Health Program Directors. While the Internet provides exciting opportunities to support person-centered health care, web-based resources may convey new barriers and, consequently, contribute to even greater health disparities for individuals with SMI. For those with limited access to computers, mobile devices may provide promising opportunities to enhance Internet access, if resources are appropriately designed and accessible. Specific Aims include: (1) Employ user experience design to make strategic recommendations for eMH redesign including the eMH4me training module and the eMH Bridges component prototypes. We will conduct structured, systematic reviews by experts and users of existing eHealth information resources (n < 20) including the current eMH resource; two focus groups of users with SMI (n < 20) to ensure the selection of appropriate content, level of complexity, and technology; and a review of eMH web analytics data from the previous 12 months. Design recommendations will comprise the eMH Strategic Plan to inform next project phases. (2) Conduct in-person usability testing to develop the fully functional eMH4me and eMH Bridges prototypes. We will conduct iterative, side-by-side sessions with individuals with SMI in the laboratory or office environment (n = 20). Appropriate modifications will be made, based on testing, to finalize the prototypes. (3) Conduct remote testing of the acceptability and feasibilit of the eMH4me and eMH Bridges prototypes with individuals with SMI (n = 100) with access to the resources for two months, to assess satisfaction, usefulness, and ease of use and learning. We will obtain feedback via telephone interviews with a purposive subsample of these users (n = 20); and evaluate usage metrics. Findings will inform refinements to eMH4me and eMH Bridges. Final products will also include the eMH Satisfaction Survey and Quality Metrics Profile for ongoing use. eMental Health will be actively sustained by long-standing partners, and will be an essential resource to individuals, organizations and institutions across the country committed to improving health outcomes for individuals with SMI."
"9402477","PROJECT SUMMARY Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) are complex genetic disorders of the gastrointestinal tract, and a major health burden to patients and society. Tremendous progress has been made in dissecting IBD genetic etiology with identification of over 200 IBD loci by genome wide association studies (GWAS) but mainly limited to persons of European ancestry. The IBD Genetics Consortium (IBDGC) was established to facilitate multicenter collaborative studies of 6 Genetics Research Centers (GRCs) organized with a Data Coordinating Center (DCC). Our GRC at Johns Hopkins (JHGRC) has contributed to all IBDGC studies, meeting recruitment objectives and taking roles in IBDGC leadership positions. Our particular focus is on African American (AA) IBD genetics. We performed the first large-scale evaluation of European loci in the AA population, replicating several genes, but also finding unique African-ancestral variants within these loci, as well as identified multiple admixture significant loci. We also published the first AA IBD genome-wide association study (GWAS), a collaborative effort that identified two African-specific gene loci, and replicated multiple additional European loci. We have also explored why some loci with proven risk variants in Europeans and other populations only cause disease in one ancestral population but not others. More research in AA IBD is needed to understand the etiology of IBD in this ancestrally distinct, major American population. In this application we will re-evaluate the AA GWAS by better imputation, evaluate whole genome sequencing data to test low frequency and rare variants, and perform an evaluation for chromosome X variants. We will recruit a large number of AA IBD patients through our own and multiple Satellite Recruitment Centers to power a second AA IBD GWAS, both UC and CD, and meta-analyze with the first to identify more novel loci, identify more African specific risk variants, and replicate known loci for this population and replicate our admixture loci. We will also incorporate diverse data sources to incorporate into our GWAS analyses including RNA-Seq currently being generated on lymophoblastoid cell lines from AA CD cases and controls, and RNA-Seq that we will generate in colonic biopsies from UC cases and controls. We will evaluate chromatin differences and expression of genes in cell types relevant to IBD from European, AA and East Asian ancestries in an effort to better understand locus heterogeneity by ancestry. We will continue to participate in all IBDGC activities to maximize the Impact of IBD genetics research by this cooperative funding mechanism."
"9526664","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The goal of this project is to establish that use of the macrolide azithromycin (AZM) during severe RSV bronchiolitis is an effective, simple, inexpensive, and safe intervention that substantially reduces the occurrence of post-RSV recurrent wheezing and potentially represents the first successful strategy for the prevention of asthma following RSV bronchiolitis. Asthma is the most common chronic disease of childhood, resulting in significant long-term morbidity. As asthma is not curable, investigation of asthma prevention strategies is highly desirable. Early life RSV bronchiolitis is a major risk factor for recurrent wheezing and asthma. The highest risk is among infants with severe bronchiolitis requiring hospitalization: up to 75% of hospitalized infants experience recurrent (?3) wheezing episodes and almost 50% are diagnosed with asthma by the age of 7 yrs. Therefore, prevention of recurrent wheeze following hospitalization for RSV bronchiolitis may reduce the subsequent diagnosis of asthma. Conventional asthma therapies are ineffective in attenuating post-RSV recurrent wheezing. Therefore, we have begun to investigate an             innovative approach for the prevention of post-RSV wheeze: the utilization of the antibiotic AZM, which has beneficial effects in other inflammatory airway diseases. Our previous proof-of-concept trial in 40 infants hospitalized with RSV bronchiolitis has shown that AZM reduced the occurrence of recurrent wheeze during the subsequent year by approximately 50% and decreased markers of airway inflammation. Moreover, our preliminary studies have suggested that AZM's beneficial effects may also be related to its anti-bacterial effect on the airway microbiome. Based on our previous observations we propose to investigate the 2 following domains: 1. to perform a clinical trial evaluating if the addition of AZM, compared to placebo, to routine bronchiolitis care in 188 infants hospitalized with RSV bronchiolitis reduces the occurrence of recurrent (?3) wheezing episodes during the preschool years. 2. To examine how AZM changes the upper airway microbiome community structure over time; and to determine if these changes are related to the reduction in the occurrence of post-RSV recurrent wheeze. This trial may identify the first effective intervention to apply during severe RSV bronchiolitis wth the goal of preventing post-RSV recurrent wheeze, and ultimately asthma. If successful, this would have significant impact on society and the health system through reductions in morbidity and health care utilization associated with recurrent wheeze and asthma. The microbiome studies in this project should inform us how the AZM modifies the microbiome, and how these changes relate to the development of recurrent wheeze. Moreover, these findings may inform the development of microbiome-directed therapies for asthma prevention."
"9332119","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The SEARCH for Diabetes in Youth Study documented a 31% increase in the prevalence of type 2 diabetes (T2D) between 2001 and 2009, as well as an increase of 21 % in the prevalence of type 1 diabetes (T1D). Increases occurred across most but not all major subgroups of age, sex and race/ethnicity. Further, we documented an annual increase in the incidence of T1D among non-Hispanic White (NHW) youth of approximately 2.7% per year. In contrast, studies from Europe suggest that incidence of T1D may be stabilizing. Thus, compelling questions remain regarding long term trends in incidence and prevalence for both T1 and T2 in youth, particularly among various racial and ethnic population subgroups. Ongoing, efficient surveillance of diabetes diagnosed in youth is essential to inform health care systems and generate testable hypotheses related to the natural history of diabetes in youth. SEARCH is uniquely positioned to address these critical questions through continued surveillance of childhood diabetes employing our well-established infrastructure for surveillance, and its highly experienced, collaborative and multi-disciplinary investigative team. Therefore, in response to RFA-DP-15-002, Component A, we propose the continuation of the SEARCH for Diabetes in Youth Registry Study (SEARCH Phase 4) during which we will continue to ascertain newly diagnosed incident diabetes cases throughout the study period and one additional prevalent cohort (index year 2017) for youth age < 20 years across our five well-established geographically dispersed Study Centers. Our approach is informed by our substantial accrued experience that allows us to conduct surveillance work in a highly efficient manner. We frame our surveillance as an innovative three-tiered approach, starting with the most broad based and cost efficient approach at the highest tier (tier 1) and becoming the most focused in tier 3, with each tier optimizing use of electronic health records (EHRs). Specific Aims are: Aim 1: TIER 1 SURVEILLANCE (Prevalence)- To ascertain cases of prevalent diabetes in calendar year 2017 among youth age < 20 years at diagnosis; Aim 2: TIER 2 SURVEILLANCE (Incidence)- To continue to ascertain newly diagnosed (2015-2020) incident diabetes cases in youth age < 20 years; Aim 3: TIER 3 SURVEILLANCE (Clinical Characteristics) - To confirm classification of diabetes type using biochemical markers, to describe selected clinical characteristics at diagnosis, and to maintain an infrastructure that facilitates the development of more detailed ancillary studies by storing biological samples and preserving contact with potential study participants; Aim 4: OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCY: To optimize efficiency of the SEARCH Surveillance activities through targeted development and validation projects designed to utilize relevant electronic health data to operationalize each of the three tiers of surveillance. Thus, the well-established and highly productive SEARCH team is uniquely positioned to provide critical information on the prevalence, incidence and early clinical course of diabetes in youth."
"9378705","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):          Cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk estimation has focused on outpatient data from whites according to age, sex, LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C), HDL-cholesterol (HDL-C), diabetes, smoking, and blood pressure (BP) information. Risk factors (RFs) and overall CVD risk are associated with genetic variations in genome-wide association studies (GWAS), and phenotypes have largely been based on single RF measurements using a Framingham approach. Previous research has focused on European Americans (EA), and generally has not included Veterans. There is little information on CVD risk factor genes in African Americans (AA) or Hispanic Americans (HA), two population groups that are extremely important in the VA. With the availability of the Million Veteran Program (MVP) cohort, we have a unique opportunity to study genes and CVD risk among these subgroups. Up to now methods have not been developed to link MVP questionnaire and genetic data to the Veteran's electronic healthcare information. We propose to address scientific gaps by focusing on multiple ethnicities, rare variants, and antecedent risk factor levels using the MVP cohort. In the proposed study, we first create a virtual baseline exam by developing methods to link data from MVP baseline examination to the VA electronic health record using a systematic approach. Results for Veterans are influenced by geographic region in the U.S., race/ethnicity, frequency of outpatient clinic visits, and other variables. Based on our systematic approach of handling MVP questionnaire data and the electronic healthcare data, we assess the genome-wide associations of both common and rare alleles with CVD RFs in causal pathways, with consideration of the environment (diet quality, pharmacological treatment), and assessment of current and antecedent RF levels. Methods include single VA outpatient measurements of quantitative CVD RFs (LDL-C, non- HDL-C, triglycerides, body mass index) with and without diet quality adjustment using the Willett Food Frequency Questionnaire performed at the MVP baseline visit. Other methods include pharmacologic treatment of CVD RFs to derive imputed untreated RF levels, and antecedent quantitative CVD RFs measured at VA outpatient visits 5 and 10 years before the MVP baseline visit when such data are available. We will perform common variant association studies (CVAS) and rare variant association studies (RVAS) testing the association of genetic variants to quantitative CVD risk for a) prevalent coronary heart disease (CHD) [myocardial infarction, history of coronary bypass grafting (CABG), history of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI)] and b) prevalent atherothrombotic stroke, with comparison of effects by race and ethnicity, and c) examine the multigenic association of CHD and stroke using the genetic risk score (GRS) of validated CVD-associated SNPs within and across ethnicity. This project will provide a platform for CVD incidence analyses for MVP participants across the VA in the future. Furthermore, the proposed study findings will allow for the comparison of the impact of genetic variants on cardio metabolic RFs risk factors and atherosclerotic disease prevalence across AA, HA, and EA Veterans. CVD accounts for an extremely large health care burden in veterans. This project will investigate the role of genetic and environmental determinants of CVD risk factors in MVP participants across different ethnic and racial groups."
"9467160","Project Summary More than 4,000 systematic reviews are performed each year in the fields of environmental health and evidence- based medicine, with each review requiring, on average, between six months to one year of effort to complete. In order to remain accurate, systematic reviews require regular updates after their initial publication, with most reviews out of date within five years. In the screening phase of systematic review, researchers use detailed inclusion/exclusion criteria to decide whether each article in a set of candidate citations is relevant to the research question under consideration. For each article considered, a researcher reads the title and abstract and evaluates its content with respect to the prespecified criteria. A typical review may require screening thousands or tens of thousands of articles in this manner. Under the assumption that it takes a skilled reviewer 30-90 seconds, on average, to screen a single abstract, dual-screening a set of 10,000 abstracts may require between 150 to 500 hours of labor. We have shown in previous work that automated machine learning methods for article prioritization can reduce by more than 50% the human effort required to screen articles for inclusion in a systematic review. Recently, we have further extended these methods and packaged them into a web-based, collaborative systematic review software application called SWIFT-Active Screener. Active Screener has been used successfully to reduce the effort required to screen articles for systematic reviews conducted at a variety of organizations including the National Institute of Environmental Health Science (NIEHS), the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), The Endocrine Disruption Exchange (TEDX), and the Evidence Based Toxicology Collaboration (EBTC). These early adopters have provided us with an abundance of useful data and user feedback, and we have identified several areas where we can continue to improve our methods and software. Our goal for the current proposal is to conduct additional research and development to make significant improvements to SWIFT-Active Screener, including several innovations that will be necessary for commercial success. The research we propose encompasses three specific aims: (1) Investigate several improvements to statistical algorithms used for article prioritization and recall estimation. We will explore promising avenues for further improving the performance of our existing algorithms and address critical technical issues that limit the applicability of our current methods (Aim 1 ? Improved Statistical Models). (2) Explore ways in which we can improve our models and methods to handle the scenario in which an existing systematic review is updated with new data several years after its initial publication (Aim 2 ? New Methods for Systematic Review Updates). (3) Investigate several questions related to scaling the system to support hundreds to thousands of simultaneous screeners (Aim 3 - Software Engineering for Scalability, Usability and Full Text Extraction)."
"9391145","PROJECT ABSTRACT: The overall goal of this project is to evaluate novel strategies for identifying genetic variation that contributes to common, complex diseases, with a specific focus on variants that contribute to cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk through parent of origin effects. CVD is the leading cause of death among men and women, and while genome wide association studies (GWAS) have identified some genetic loci that contribute to CVD risk, a lot still remains unknown. The risk alleles identified by GWAS explain little of the heritability of the trait and some of this ?missing heritability? has been attributed to parent of origin effects. I propose to bridge this gap of knowledge by characterizing parent of origin effects on gene expression and on CVD associated phenotypes and calculate parent of origin heritability for CVD phenotypes in the Hutterites. The Hutterites are a founder population of European descent and our group studies a group of ~1400 individuals who descend from 64 founders and are related to each other in a 13 generation pedigree. The Hutterites live communally in the northern plains states and western Canada. With an extended and well recorded pedigree and technological advances in sequencing, we can impute Hutterite genotypes with high accuracy and identify the parent of origin of alleles from 98 Hutterite whole genome sequences to the remaining >1400 individuals in our sample. In addition to gene expression in LCLs and whole blood, we recorded CVD-association phenotypes for a subset of this sample that include measurements of lipids (LDL-c, HDL-c, total cholesterol, triglycerides, and Lp(a)), blood pressure (systolic and diastolic), carotid artery media thickness (CIMT), and echocardiographic traits (left ventricular mass, left atrial volume, among many others), as well as inflammatory cell counts. With this unique population resource, we can disentangle the contribution of maternally inherited alleles and paternally inherited alleles to CVD-associated phenotypes and ultimately to risk for cardiovascular disease."
"9393803","PROJECT SUMMARY (30 lines) Exposure to childhood adversity (CA) is associated with elevated risk for psychopathology. One consistently documented consequence of CA exposure in females is earlier age of pubertal onset. Early pubertal timing in females is also associated with elevated risk for mood and anxiety disorders?although the mechanisms through which early pubertal timing conveys risk for psychopathology are not well understood. In males, non- normative (i.e., early or late) pubertal timing is associated with risk for psychopathology, but associations of CA with pubertal timing in males have rarely been studied. Exposure to sex hormones at a non-normative age may alter neural development in ways that enhance vulnerability for adolescent psychopathology. However, scant research has examined how CA influences pubertal timing, how CA and pubertal timing impact brain development, and how these factors might ultimately contribute to risk for psychopathology. Even less research has examined whether and how these pathways might differ for males and females. The proposed studies address these gaps, with the goal of identifying mechanisms through which CA, pubertal timing, and brain development influence risk for psychopathology in adolescents. First, the proposed work will examine how different dimension of CA influence pubertal timing, in adolescent males and females. Second, we will investigate whether non-normative pubertal timing is a mechanism explaining the association between CA and psychopathology in adolescent males and females. Third, we will investigate whether pubertal timing-related changes in cortical-limbic circuitry mediate the association between CA and psychopathology in early adolescent females. Data will come from two samples. The first two aims will be examined in a large, nationally-representative sample of 6,483 adolescents aged 13-17 years who participated in in the National Comorbidity Survey-Adolescent Sample (NCS-A). This sample will allow us to investigate how different dimensions of CA influence pubertal timing and whether pubertal timing is a mechanism linking CA and psychopathology in adolescent males and females. The second sample comes from an ongoing longitudinal sample of 300 children followed annually from age 3 years. Data will be drawn from the most recent wave, at age 10-11 years where participants are completing fMRI scanning during a fear conditioning task. This study will permit examination of how alterations in pubertal timing and CA exposure impact cortical-limbic circuitry and, ultimately, adolescent psychopathology. The results of these studies will provide insight into the pathways through which CA, pubertal timing and brain development contribute to adolescent psychopathology. This award will provide the candidate, who has a strong background in clinical neuroscience in adolescence, with training in childhood adversity, pubertal development, and neurodevelopment models of adolescence to facilitate her transition to an independent research career."
"9566428","Abstract  The external anal sphincter (EAS) is essential for maintaining fecal continence, which affects 6% to 19% of elderly individuals aged 65 years and older living in the community. Aging significantly affects anorectal function both neurogenically and myogenically. However, there is an unmet need of advanced and less- invasive approaches to quantitatively and objectively evaluate the neuromuscular function of the EAS. Anorectal imaging techniques with ultrasound or magnetic resonance imaging provide useful information in detecting anatomical defects in the EAS, but they are not capable of detecting neurogenic injuries. Intramuscular electromyography (EMG) is the only technique available for documenting neurogenic sphincter injury, but its application is limited by its highly invasive nature, poor repeatability and inability to describe global innervation. Pudendal nerve terminal motor latency has several limitations including the fact that a normal latency time does not exclude neuropathy and its clinical significance remains controversial. Anorectal manometry measures pressures of the anal sphincter muscles, sensation in the rectum, and neural reflexes that are necessary for normal bowel movements. However, normal ranges of various parameters measured are highly variable and poorly reproducible.  The goal of this project is to develop a minimally invasive EAS innervation pattern characterization technique using the most recent advances in high-density (HD) surface EMG recording and signal processing techniques, to quantitatively and objectively assess the neuromuscular function of the EAS, 1) at rest when only tonic activities are present, 2) during voluntary contraction when motor units are selectively recruited, and 3) under supramaximal pudendal stimulation when all motor units are simultaneously activated, as well as to investigate specific alterations of the EAS innervation associated with aging.  This research represents the first effort to quantitatively and objectively characterize the innervation patterns of the EAS under three different physiological conditions. The innervation patterns of the EAS characterized at rest, during voluntary contraction and under supramaximal pudendal nerve stimulation provide specific EAS function information associated with the resting tone, voluntary activation and global innervation of the EAS respectively. Aging effects on specific changes of the EAS innervation under these three conditions will be investigated. The proposed EAS innervation pattern characterization technique will serve as a novel phenotyping and predictive tool for anorectal dysfunctions caused by neurogenic weaknesses of the EAS. The results will advance our understanding of the pathophysiology of anorectal neuromuscular dysfunctions associated with aging, will also have clinical significance with regard to future therapeutic ?choice? of biofeedback or surgical intervention."

"9351579","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Gaucher's disease (GD), the most common lysosomal storage disorder, is caused by recessively inherited mutations in the glucosidase, beta, acid (GBA1) gene, which encodes glucocerebrosidase, a lysosomal enzyme that catalyzes the breakdown of the sphingolipid glucosylceramide. GD encompasses a wide spectrum of clinical symptoms, including severe and untreatable neurological abnormalities. Over the past ten years it has become increasingly clear that patients with GD also have a dramatically elevated risk of Parkinson's disease (PD), a common movement disorder characterized by the death of dopaminergic neurons in the midbrain and the accumulation of intracellular neuronal protein aggregates known as Lewy bodies. More recently, this finding has led to the discovery that heterozygous mutations in GBA1 are the most common genetic association with PD and Lewy body dementia (LBD), possibly accounting for 7-10% of these diseases. The mechanisms by which GBA1 mutations cause neurological symptoms of GD, and increase the risk of PD and LBD, are poorly understood. We hypothesize that the neurological symptoms of GD derive from the lysosomal accumulation of glucosylceramide, and a consequent defect in the degradative capacity of the lysosome. We further hypothesize that mutations in GBA1 increase the risk for PD and LBD by impairing the lysosomal degradation of ?-synuclein protein, a major component of the Lewy body aggregates that define both of these diseases. Finally, we hypothesize that genetic modifiers largely account for the poor genotype-phenotype correlation observed in GD and the low penetrance of GBA1 mutations in PD and LBD. To explore these hypotheses, we have created a Drosophila model of glucocerebrosidase deficiency that exhibits shortened lifespan, locomotor and memory deficits, neurodegeneration, and accumulation of protein aggregates. We propose to use our Drosophila model of glucocerebrosidase deficiency, as well as an existing mouse model of glucocerebrosidase deficiency, to pursue three aims. First, we will test the hypothesis that lysosomal glucosylceramide accumulation is responsible for the phenotypes of our Drosophila model of glucocerebrosidase deficiency. Second, we will test the hypothesis that glucocerebrosidase deficiency impairs lysosomal protein degradation, including the degradation of ?-synuclein. Third, we will conduct a genetic screen to identify novel modifiers of the phenotypes caused by glucocerebrosidase deficiency. Our work will contribute to a mechanistic understanding of GD, PD and LBD, and this insight will facilitate risk assessment in the clinic and provide a foundation for the development of treatments."
"9311655","Vision loss in a wide range of ischemic retinopathies such as retinopathy of prematurity and proliferative diabetic retinopathy is caused by aberrant neovascular growth and altered vascular barrier integrity. The overreaching goal of this proposal is to gain new insights into the pathogenesis of neovascular diseases by elucidating yet undefined vascular and inflammatory mechanisms driving sprouting angiogenesis and regressive remodeling of the retinal vasculature. a novel angiomodulatory system controlled byThe project focuses on the matricellular Cysteine-rich protein 61 referred to as CCN1. CCN1 is a central element of a pericellular network of bioactive extracellular matrix proteins acting through interaction with integrins to regulate diverse cellular functions. CCN1 is highly expressed by angiogenic endothelial cells (ECs) and macrophages at sites of active angiogenesis and inflammation. Research from the previous funding period has shown that CCN1-integrin signaling regulates vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) signaling, induces Notch-dependent intercellular communication and vessel specification and maintains barrier function. In cultured ECs, CCN1 is engaged in bidirectional molecular cross talks with the Hippo-Yes-Associated protein (YAP) pathway, a key checkpoint of tissue growth and homeostasis. We hypothesize that such functional interactions regulate the phenotypic plasticity of ECs during sprouting angiogenesis. Meanwhile, CCN1 is strongly expressed in macrophages involved in vasoobliteration and/or vessel involution so that CCN1 deficiency suppresses both macrophage-induced programmed fetal vessel regression and EC death. We hypothesize that CCN1-derived signals coordinate in cell type- and context-specific manner, the execution of multiple angiogenic and inflammatory programs that determine the angiogenic outcome under pathological conditions. Specific Aim 1 will (i) tease out the molecular bases of the CCN1-Hippo-YAP-regulatory axis in the endothelium, (ii) determine whether and how the CCN1-Hippo-YAP signaling pathway integrates other signaling cues (e.g., Notch, Wnt, VEGF) to produce a uniform angiogenic response, and (iii) define how this novel layer of extracellular signaling integration feeds on YAP function at the  . Specific Aim 2 will determine (i) the role and significance of the CCN1-Hippo-YAP regulatory axis in retinal neovascularization and loss of barrier function using mouse models of oxygen-induced retinopathy and vascular permeability, and (ii) how CCN1 and YAP inter-regulation molecularly affects barrier gene expression level integrity. Specific Aim 3 will define the macrophage-derived CCN1 signals driving physiological remodeling of ocular vessels and the inflammatory response under ischemic conditions. It will identify macrophage-derived CCN1 signals critical for programmed pruning of retinal vessels and regressive remodeling of hylaoid vessels during development and determine whether priming macrophage-progenitors with CCN1 prevent retinal vascular damages induced by ischemia. This research will provide novel insights into the pathogenesis of ischemic retinopathies and identify effective targeted therapeutics curtailing both neovascular growth and inflammation."

"9341531","PROJECT SUMMARY Computed tomography is used in about 80 million imaging studies per year in the USA. Iodinated contrast agents are used in roughly half of these studies. Computed tomography is particularly important for the diagnosis of coronary artery disease, where it depends on the use of iodinated contrast agents to visualize the arteries. However, these agents have a number of shortcomings, such as short circulation times, causing allergic reactions and contrast-induced nephropathy. The latter condition results in higher morbidity, mortality and costs and is most common in patients with poor kidney function. The proportion of patients over 65 with kidney disease is 26%. This percentage is rapidly rising, since the incidence of diabetes is rapidly increasing (projected to affect 30% of the US population by 2050) and kidney disease is a common complication of diabetes. The risk of cardiovascular disease is trebled for diabetics. Therefore there is a growing population that will suffer cardiovascular disease, but for whom the current diagnostic agents can be harmful, creating a pressing need for new CT contrast agents. Others and we have shown gold nanoparticles to be highly effective, biocompatible CT contrast agents that have long circulation times. However, gold nanoparticles are typically very slowly excreted, leading to the risk of long term toxicities and would preclude FDA-approval. Penn faculty, together with PolyAurum LLC, propose to address this issue via development of biodegradable gold nanoparticles. We have chosen a comparatively simple, yet flexible nanoparticle design in order to improve the likelihood of translation. The nanoparticles should circulate in the blood for some hours, before gradually breaking down into their components for renal excretion. Rapid excretion should be avoided to prevent a burden on the kidneys, but excretion should be reasonably fast to avoid the potential for long-term safety issues and confounding follow-up imaging studies. We will therefore study how to tune degradation to occur over 48 hours. We will confirm the biocompatibility of the new formulations in vitro. We will then ensure that the new formulation provides excellent in vivo CT contrast, as well as determining in vivo biocompatibility and excretion. After these experiments, we will be well placed to raise additional funds to complete toxicology screening to allow us to apply for investigational new drug (IND) status. Approval of the IND application would set the stage for clinical trials of the formulation."
"9392449","PROJECT SUMMARY  The goal of this research project proposal is to develop a physiologic model of ex vivo tumor culture to study responsiveness to immune checkpoint blockade. Although inhibitors of the PD-1/PD-L1 and CTLA4 immune checkpoints have led to remarkable and durable responses in cancers such as malignant melanoma, the ability to predict the activity for individual patients remains limited, and have relied on measurements from fixed tumor tissue. While the ability to grow patient derived tumors in organoid models, for example, has been rigorously demonstrated over the past several years, these systems lack key features of the tumor microenvironment, including a vascular network and immune cells. Thus, an ex vivo system that supports tumor and immune cell culture by recapitulating a physiologic microenvironment will almost certainly be essential to the development of functional assays that can predict patient response to immunotherapy.  Recently, we demonstrated that our three-dimensional microfluidic culture system can support growth of primary human tumor spheroids derived from multiple different cancer types, including melanoma. Importantly, immune profiling of the cells within the spheroids reveals that they also contain a significant proportion of tumor associated immune cells, including macrophages, dendritic cells, and antigen experienced T lymphocytes. Exposure of these short term spheroid cultures to immune checkpoint inhibitors such as anti- PD1 antibodies results in evidence of immunologic response and robust cytokine secretion into conditioned medium, as well as evidence of cell killing in some cases.  The broad, long term objective of this proposal is to extend this preliminary model to leverage the capabilities developed in our labs to incorporate a microcirculatory network in the 3D matrix surrounding the tumor and use this as a means of subsequently introducing selected myeloid cells. Both the initial model and these extensions to it will be subject to detailed validation in order to develop a realistic physiologic culture system that enables prediction of immunotherapy response. A unique aspect of this work is that it spans basic and translational research, including the use of animal models to help engineer vascularized networks, and patient-derived samples and clinical response to immune checkpoint blockade to validate the system. Specific aims are to: 1) Refine and validate an existing microfluidic tumor culture model to assess response to immune checkpoint inhibitor therapies 2) Incorporate vascular flow of immune cells to monitor extravasation and expansion of immune effector cells in tumor culture, and 3) Directly compare ex vivo experiments with patient specific response to immune checkpoint blockade. Through these complementary studies, the ultimate goal is to develop a robust model that can eventually be adapted to clinical use to help target immune checkpoint inhibitor therapies to the appropriate subgroup of patients. This basic platform will also be useful in other settings, once it has been fully evaluations"
"9306566","Project Abstract With the SARS outbreak in 2002 and more recently with Ebola in West Africa, the threat of emerging and re-emerging infections is a real and present danger facing the global community. Uganda is located in a hot spot for these infections. We propose to leverage the research and capacity building experience of the Infectious Diseases Institute (IDI) and its collaborative and productive relationship with the government of Uganda (GOU) to develop a generate evidence-based approaches to diseases surveillance and potentially enhance the country capacity to prevent, detect and effectively respond to emerging infectious disease threats. The IDI is a research, clinical and training center of excellence based that the pre-eminent institution of learning in Uganda-Makerere University. Established in 2002, the IDI has established a strong track record in performing locally relevant research that leads to improved models of care and changes in policy and practice in the area of HIV and related infections. In addition, the outreach programs largely funded by the CDC and 12 PEPFAR as the key implementing partner took a strong health systems institutional strengthening approach to provide prevention care and treatment to more than 100,000 patients. The proposal seeks to address specific high-priority implementation gaps in diseases surveillance in Uganda by evaluating current approaches; designing candidate model and to rigorously test their impact in enhancing surveillance. It is innovative because it leverages on-going surveillance approaches implemented under the leadership of the emergency operation centre (EOC) and the ministry of Health (MOH); to develop and rigorously evaluate innovative surveillance models. Additionally, the proposed research which is co-sponsored by the Uganda MOH will potentially lead to changes in policy and practice, as well as enhance the Ugandan MOH?s capacity to undertake future operational research/implementation science studies."
"9512303","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Cerebral palsy (CP) is a devastating disease usually originating from hypoxia-ischemia (H-I) before birth. It has one of the very highest indices of burden of disease because of the life-long consequences to the patient, the care-takers, and social institutions. The costs to society are huge, to the tune of $11.5 billion, not counting the loss of potential productive members of society. Prevention of a single CP patient would save almost $1.2 million, not factoring loss in productivity of the young parents of CP children. The number of affected CP patients, 800,000 in USA, and burden of disease is higher than many adult neurological diseases affecting the twilight years. Yet, there is a paucity of effective therapies for CP. The lack of progress in CP has been probably because of a lack of sufficient allocated resources, lack of a clinically relevant animal model and a lack of a systematic approach to tackle the problem. The latter two are addressed in this proposal. We will use the rabbit model of CP that develops after acute placental insufficiency at preterm gestation, based on the human disease of abruptio placentae. This H-I model is the first to reliably lead to CP, allowing us to rigorously test not only mechanistic pathways but possible therapies for CP for which there is none currently available. We have identified new novel drugs aimed at inhibiting neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) and shown that these drugs prevent CP in the rabbit when given antenatally. We have also shown that antenatal antioxidants also similarly prevent CP. With the development of a surrogate marker of MRI, we can predict which fetuses will develop postnatal motor deficits. With H-I, cell death occurs in many forms, including two forms that specifically involve oxidants, called necroptosis and ferroptosis. The main question asked in this proposal is whether the two forms of cell death triggered by oxidants, causes the development of motor deficits. The first Aim will determine which forms of cell death are critically associated specifically with motor deficits. The second Aim will determine if oxidants trigger the critical forms of cell death that lead to motor deficits. The underlying biochemical mechanisms will be studied utilizing the identification of fetuses destined to get postnatal hypertonia and studying entire brain, brain regions and cell suspensions. New innovations proposed are the systemic integration of MRI as a surrogate marker with flow cytometry techniques, electron microscopy, electron paramagnetic spectroscopy and high performance liquid chromatography into the unique animal model to probe the biochemical basis of two forms of cell death. These studies will elucidate the early events around critical cell death that cause motor deficits. The clinical importance is that the proposed studies provides the mechanistic understanding for the systematic development of much-needed therapies for CP, and thus expedites the clinical application of these therapies."
"9564546","Soon after beginning our program, we converted the animal room that housed classroom animals into an animal care facility for research animals. We hired a veterinarian and three animal technicians, bought supplies and animals, all with RCMI funds. In 2007, the College, again with its commitment to our program, institutionalized our facility and constructed an eight room, 5,000 square foot vivarium, which is attached to the science building through a short hallway. The animal care facility operates under an Assurance with the Office of Laboratory Animal Welfare and is registered with the United States Department of Agriculture and the New York State Department of Health. The facility consists of, 3,500 square feet for animal housing. There are two separate heating and cooling units (both have a main unit and a backup unit). There is an oil fueled emergency generator to protect against power loss. The facility uses Opti mice caging which uses the buildings exhaust system to ventilate the cages. This allows us to properly maintain our cages without the added noise or heat of traditional ventilated cages, making this a more environmentally friendly system. Our cage washer has a pass thru rack washer (from a dirty room to a clean room) as well as a pass thru autoclave. We use filtered and reverse osmosis-treated water for all animals. The facility is new and was designed to be able to house a variety of animals. We house mice, rats, rabbits and ferrets. There is a room for transgenic mice, available within this facility however, birds are maintained in an auxiliary facility on the 8th floor of the science building. The entire facility is monitored by Semen's monitoring system, which is will notify essential personnel in emergency situations. A manager, three technicians and a consulting veterinarian staff the facility. The veterinarian for the facility is Dr. Sulli Popilskis DVM, DACLAM, a Diplomat of the American Collage of Laboratory Animal Medicine (ACLAM), and is also a member of The City Collage Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. He is responsible for the Program of Veterinary Care (a USDA requirement) at CCNY. He is the former Associate Director of the Institute of Comparative Medicine at Columbia University. With his experience at Columbia University and his credentials, he is an expert on USDA, PHS and New York State regulations for the Housing and care of laboratory animals and the requirements to maintain an approved animal facility. He provides the IACUC committee and program manager with information on the reporting requirements for various species, reviews and approves all animal protocols and conducts at least two inspections of the facilities per year. He is also on call to advise researchers on techniques, anesthesia, and all other areas of animal care and research. He does regular serological testing to ensure the health of the colonies and necropsies on animals whose cause of death is unknown. In accordance with our USDA registration and PHS Assurance, he reviews our facilities program and prepared the Plan of Veterinary Care at CCNY. As the attending Veterinarian, he also attends to sick animals in the facility, assessing their health, treating them when applicable and assessing the potential ramifications to the specific colony. As the City collage of New York veterinarian of record, he meets with others involved in the planning, designing, and implementation of the renovation of the animal facility. We also have a backup veterinarian who is available when Dr. Popilskis is unavailable. Dr. Steven Brunnert D.V.M., DACLAM, DACVP. The facility manager, Harry Acosta is a Licensed Veterinary Technician, Certified LATG, and ILAM Certified. We currently have three caretakers, paid by the College and the RCMI is proposing to hire a forth in this proposal. There is a room for transgenic mice, available within this facility however, birds are maintained in an auxiliary facility on the 8th floor of the science building. Other birds are located on floors 7 and 13. It is important to re-state that there are only three technicians in the entire facility. As a result of building the new facility the number of animals rose quickly (4,500 mice, 362 rats, 300 finches, 52 chicks, 8 ferrets). This was unexpected and not a part of the College's new animal room budget. To aid in this transition and to relieve the overload of work, we propose to hire one additional animal technician in this proposal. This will ensure the success of the Animal Facility with respect to the College's appropriation of $6M to the construction of this facility. We propose to hire a person with experience working with mice, rats, rabbits and chickens. Although this individual will work with all of the animals listed above, his/her primary focus will be with birds. Birds are housed in our auxiliary facility, which requires much more attention than previously estimated. The person hired will be asked to provide general care and maintenance of laboratory animals under the standards and regulations set by the NIH and the Board of Health. They must have training in daily record keeping and monthly census tracking. This person should also have the educational background to indicate his/her ability to learn basic experimental procedures. In addition to animal care, this individual will be asked to provide technical assistance when necessary. These procedures include preparation procedures for surgery, basic surgical procedures, dissections, and experimental documentations. Finally, in addition to his work with the birds (Wallman) this animal caretaker will be asked to assist with breeding, surgery and genotyping of mice & rats. We believe that the addition of one more caretaker will aid in the successful application for AAALAC approval, to be submitted by December 2011. This individual will work with Drs. Pezzano, Ali, Wallman, Guyden, Spatz, Levitt, and Saleque."

The PRC examines how to link evidence to practice and policy through translation, dissemination, and implementation research. In response to community needs and CDC priorities, we focus our research and scholarship on reducing the burden of obesity (Winnable Battles1), diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and certain cancers. Our commitment is to investigate and discover solutions to the burden of disease experienced by under-represented populations, especially American Indians and Hispanics, living in under-resourced rural communities. Specifically, we address the underlying risk factors for chronic diseases that have high prevalence in these populations. Utilizing our well-established infrastructure, multidisciplinary research team, strong  partnerships and proven record of accomplishments, we propose to investigate, expand and disseminate what is most effective and feasible in rural communities based upon the findings of our prior research. We plan to study the process of dissemination and implementation (D&I) of evidence-based strategies for increasing physical activity, improving nutrition, and promoting tobacco free living. We are calling our research project Village Interventions and Venues for Action II, (VIVA II) to indicate that our proposed study is both a continuation, and major expansion and scaling-up of VIVA-Step into Cuba, our 2010-2014 research project. We have worked successfully with partners in Cuba, New Mexico to evaluate the translation, dissemination and implementation of 5 evidence-based recommendations from the Guide to Community Preventive Services. The PRC plans to continue and expand the existing study (Beta Site), scale up its successful strategies to rural communities county-wide (Proximity Spread) through a health council partnership, disseminate and implement strategies state-wide (Widespread Application) with the help of key organizational partners, and study the process for its successes and failures. Building on national, state, community and PRC priorities, the UNM PRC will address existing gaps in translating evidence-based interventions into practice by expanding our knowledge and understanding of the D&I process. We will do this through a prospective study of the D&I of effective strategies to promote active living, healthy eating, and tobacco free living in tri-ethnic, rural populations in New Mexico."
"9343374","Summary/Abstract A cell's history determines its fate and physiology, but it has been technically challenging to follow cellular history at a large scale and over extended periods. It has therefore been difficult to answer many important questions in biology and medicine: how are the cells in an organism related through their lineage? When was a cell exposed to a signal? Which neurons were active during a particular behavioral state? Answering these questions is fundamental for understanding the dynamics of multicellular systems. The premise of this proposal is that just as evolutionary history is recorded in genome sequence changes, a cell's history can be recorded by the introduction of changes in the genome. Recent genome editing studies have resulted in the development of a technology called GESTALT that uses the combinatorial and cumulative editing of a genomic barcode to permanently mark cells and through sequencing uncovers their lineage relationships. This and complementary studies have demonstrated the remarkable potential for DNA-mediated recording. The proposed project aims to optimize DNA-mediated recording and combine it with other nascent technologies to (1) record the lineage trees that generate the juvenile brain; (2) record the cellular history of Notch and TGFß signaling pathway activation; and (3) record the history of neuronal activity during day/wake and night/sleep. Zebrafish will be used as a model system because of the powerful application of genomic, genetic and imaging approaches and its relevance to other vertebrates, including humans.  "

"9395232","PROJECT SUMMARY  The inner hair cells reside in a highly polarized ionic environment that is critical for proper transduction of sound waves into neural signals. Potassium-rich endolymph bathes the apical surface of the sensory epithelium, prompting a passive, depolarizing influx of K+ into the hair cells through transduction channels when their stereocilia are deflected, and a repolarizing efflux when K+ flows down its concentration gradient through basally-located K+ channels. The appositional supporting cells are thought to clear K+ and recycle it back into the endolymphatic space through gap-junction coupling, but how supporting cells regulate and remove extracellular K+ remains unclear.  This proposal seeks to investigate the novel hypothesis that supporting cells can directly influence the excitability of nearby hair cells by regulating the local K+ concentration in response to extracellular cues. Preliminary data demonstrate that inhibiting the metabotropic purinergic P2Y1 receptor (P2ry1), which appears to be expressed exclusively in supporting cells, results in tonic activation of the inner hair cells. Given the known sensitivity of hair cells to extracellular K+, it is likely that slow K+ accumulation occurs after loss of P2ry1 signaling, leading to a depolarization of hair cells. Using whole-cell electrophysiology, the membrane potential of inner hair cells will be measured after inhibition of P2ry1 and in P2ry1-/- mice to test this hypothesis. Similar experiments will be performed with and without K+ channel blockers in the recording pipette to determine if K+ is mediating this effect.  Astrocytes, which maintain extracellular K+ in the brain, increase K+ uptake following purinergic activation and subsequent stimulation of the Na,K-ATPase. Given many similarities between astrocytes and supporting cells, it is possible that similar mechanisms for K+ clearance are employed by these cells. This leads to the hypothesis that P2Y1 inhibition reduces the activity of the Na,K-ATPase in supporting cells, resulting in accumulation of extracellular K+ and tonic activation of hair cells. Preliminary data suggest that the Na,K- ATPase promotes K+ clearance in the supporting cells. Whole-cell electrophysiology in both hair cells and supporting cells will be used to investigate the interaction between Na,K-ATPase and P2ry1.  The effect of blocking or removing P2ry1 in ex vivo preps is clear: hair cells become tonically active. To investigate this mechanism in vivo, neural activity of auditory neurons in the inferior colliculus will be imaged using genetically-encoded indicators in P2ry1-/- and wildtype littermate controls. If P2ry1 regulates the excitability of hair cells, increased uncorrelated activity is expected in P2ry1-/- mice. These studies will extend our knowledge about sound transduction, the consequences of purinergic signaling following acoustic trauma, and peripheral tinnitus, which is thought to arise from hyperexcitability in the inner ear."
"9352771","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): With the recognition that medical care is often poorly provided, deficient, and excessively costly without benefit, there has been increasing scrutiny on the safety and quality of healthcare in the U.S. Two interrelated clinical areas that are at a nascent stage in the study of patient safety are maternal and neonatal care. As the U.S. continues to have higher maternal and neonatal mortality compared to other developed countries, we have an exciting opportunity to advance the science of safety in healthcare with a multidisciplinary approach including qualitative research methods, design thought, simulation, controlled trials, and implementation science. This project will focus on the safety of perinatal care, with a focus on labor and delivery, which is the most common reason for hospitalization in the U.S. The principles learned from our approach may also serve to study safety issues in other areas of the hospital. Therefore, this project has the potential to not only contribute to improving safety and quality for mothers and newborns, but also contribute to the general science of safety in healthcare. Our proposal will also have the potential to have an immediate impact on patient outcomes, as stages of the research will necessarily be carried out in patient care settings. In this proposed project, we will perform work that will: 1) establish a perinatal safety learning laboratory, 2) develop and test an optimal neonatal resuscitation data display, 3) develop and test an optimal maternal data display, 4) develop a process to recognize and prevent maternal clinical deterioration, and 5) develop the optimal physical design of a labor and delivery suite. Our safety learning laboratory will perform work on four interrelated projects: Project #1: An optimal interactive data display for neonatal resuscitation. Project #2: An optimal data display for labor and delivery. Project #3: Improving recognition of maternal clinical deterioration, and Project #4: Physical design of the optimal delivery suite. We will expand the knowledge base on patient safety for neonatal and maternal care by establishing a safety learning laboratory, bringing together obstetrics, neonatology, nursing, design specialists, engineers, and parent representatives, and using simulation methodology to develop, pilot, and test innovative designs in the four projects."
"9313624","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): ABSTRACT  The present research advances the science of sexual assault prevention research by rigorously evaluating two theoretically-driven, multi-session sexual assault prevention programs for high school boys with different administration approaches: (1) Your Voice Your View, developed and currently administered in Rhode Island high schools by the CDC RPE-funded agency Day One of Rhode Island; and (2) The High School Workshop, adapted from the Men's Workshop, which was previously evaluated among college men by members of this research team. Our approach to this efficacy research is not only rigorous, but also novel; exemplifying how mutually beneficial partnerships between well-established researchers and community agencies advance the science of sexual assault prevention by enhancing the capacity of community agencies to conduct rigorous program evaluations and enriching the ability of researchers to develop interventions that are sustainable outside of a laboratory setting. In the Refinement and Planning Phase, we will refine the program manuals through informant interviews, focus groups, stakeholder interviews, establishment of a Research Advisory Board, and administration of a small open pilot trial. An online survey will also be conducted to gather social norms data, and The High School Workshop will be adapted to be feasible and sustainable in a high school setting. In order to consistently administer Your Voice Your View in the context of this research design, the program will be further manualized, training manuals will be produced, and measures assessing the fidelity of program administration (i.e., adherence/competence measures) will be developed. In the Intervention Phase, we will conduct a randomized controlled trial with a sample of 1200 10th grade boys to demonstrate efficacy of each intervention in reducing rates of sexual aggression, dating violence involvement, and related risk/protective factors over a 6-month follow-up relative to a dose- and attention-matched General Health Promotion control group. At least six schools will be matched on demographic characteristics (i.e., % receiving subsidized lunch, racial/ethnic minority enrollment) then randomized to receive Your Voice Your View (N = 400), the High School Workshop (N = 400), or General Health Promotion (N = 400). In the Analysis and Dissemination Phase, we will conduct additional stakeholder interviews (N = 12), analyze study data, conduct cost-effectiveness analyses, prepare project reports, and share study findings with the schools as well as the local and national scientific communities. By addressing the weaknesses of both the community-based prevention program (i.e., lacking rigorous evaluation) and the research-based prevention program (i.e., lacking real-world applicability), testing both programs in comparison to a dose-and attention-matched control group, and conducting a preliminary examination of the differential efficacy of the two interventions, the results of this research will make a significant contribution to the evidence base for preventing sexual aggression among high school boys. The knowledge, infrastructure and experience provided to the community agency and research team as a result of conducting the present research will also enhance the capacities of both parties to more effectively integrate research and practice in future sexual assault prevention work."
"9418435","Project Summary/Abstract  Cardiovascular disease, such as heart failure, atrial and ventricular arrhythmias, hypertensive and valvular heart disease is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the USA and the world. Importantly, over 500,000 cardiac surgeries and procedures, which require detailed cardiac diagnostics and intense monitoring, are performed to treat arrhythmias and structural heart disease in the US each year, which together carry a morbidity and mortality risk of 1-30%, depending on a patient's comorbidities. Cardiovascular specialists are required to monitor the heart routinely during interventions and almost exclusively rely on surface ECG and pressure measurements from the heart and vascular compartments and in selected cases electrical mapping of the heart. Current state-of-art technologies for cardiac electrophysiological and surgical therapies for management of complex atrial and ventricular arrhythmias provide limited and time-disparate data to guide interventions and monitor patients, primarily relying on hemodynamic parameters, gross and time-consuming point-by-point electrophysiological mapping techniques, and intermittent evaluation of blood chemistries. At present these data, in addition to being limited, often have substantial time delays from sampling to usable readouts leading to increase intraoperative and post-operative recovery time.  This proposal outlines development of a conceptually new approach to cardiac monitoring that can impact diagnostics, therapeutics, and ultimately lead to closed-loop bioelectronics control of the heart. For Quantum Phase 1, three aims are proposed: Aim 1: Development of bioelectronic interfaces, platforms/modules, and analytical tools for real-time assessments of the cardiac interstitial and vascular parameters (catecholamine levels, acid-base and metabolic indices), along with high-density thin-film microarrays for mapping of cardiac electrical function and recording of peripheral cardiac autonomic neural activity. Aim 2: Integration of monitoring platforms, technologies, and analytics for cardiac electrophysiological mapping, multi-point cardiac pacing, hemodynamics, autonomic function, and real-time assessments of interstitial (and plasma) neurotransmitters and neuropeptide levels, acid-base levels, and metabolic factors. Aim 3: Discovery and validation of critical autonomic, metabolic, and electrophysiological parameters that precede and predict adverse cardiac events in infarcted porcine hearts and initial proof-of-concept human studies. Developing and optimizing new mapping arrays and systems for real-time measurement and evaluation of multiple electrophysiological parameters simultaneously with instantaneous ?read-outs? of regional autonomic function (neural and cardiac interstitial neurotransmitters) has the potential to revolutionize the practice of medicine and patient care."
"9346056","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The objective of the proposed NIDDK K01 award is to develop an independent research program that investigates environmental and behavioral approaches to mitigating multigenerational effects maternal obesity. The candidate is an obesity epidemiologist with strong expertise in environmental and behavioral influences on obesity in adolescents and adults, and a wide range of quantitative methods. The candidate has recent expertise in the perinatal period of the life course and fetal programming of obesity. The candidate's long-term goal is to contribute understanding of how biological susceptibilities programmed in early life interact with a complex system of behaviors and environments through the life course and through multiple generations. The proposed career development goals include gaining expertise in (1) placental biology and its linkages to fetal programming and (2) systems science. This expertise is necessary for innovative transdisciplinary research that integrates biological and epidemiological knowledge to investigate multigenerational obesity processes. This training will be supported by an interdisciplinary mentorship team composed of experts in chronic disease epidemiology (Fortmann; primary mentor), fetal programming and placentology (Thornburg), maternal-fetal medicine (Caughey), and systems science (Wakeland). The proposed research will develop a novel methodology for investigating the effects of maternal obesity over multiple generations. It overcomes the challenge that fetal programming is an inherently multigenerational phenomenon, yet multigenerational research in human populations is not feasible with traditional methods. It uses a complex system modeling technique - agent-based models - to integrate robust empirical data on fetal programming processes and multi-level influences on human behavior in a synthetic population. The model will account for the biological effects of maternal obesity on offspring obesity susceptibility, cumulative impacts of childhood behaviors on prenatal behaviors and health, and other complexities. We will (1) develop and validate the agent-based model, then use it to (2) determine the effects of fetal programming on population-wide and subgroup-specific obesity prevalence over four generations and (3) determine the effects of simulated diet and physical activity changes on population-wide obesity prevalence over four generations. This research will quantify how maternal obesity can induce a positive feedback loop of escalating obesity and provide the first assessment of optimal strategies that yield optimal long-term reductions in obesity prevalence within a complex system. Research and training activities will culminate in submission of R01 applications to investigate how fetal programming propagates multigenerational race/ethnic disparities in obesity-related health (agent-based model), and integration of placental metrics in an epidemiologic study of behavioral factors that remediate fetal programming alterations."
"9440022","Project Summary/Abstract Rapid social and environmental development in low and middle income countries (LMIC) has contributed to the increasing prevalence of obesity and cardiometabolic disease in children and adults. Changes in diet, however, have outpaced water and sanitation improvements, contributing to a dual burden of overweight/noncommunicable disease (OWT/NCD) and persistent undernutrition and infectious disease (UND/ID) within individuals and households. Disentangling the biological, social and environmental pathways leading to the dual burden of disease is particularly critical in LMIC, like Ecuador, where economic development has been rapid and accompanied by dramatic shifts in diet, disease burden and lifestyle. Yet, little work has examined the independent and joint impact of water and food access, quality and security on the development of OWT/NCD and UND/ID or how psychological distress (PD) associated with insecure access to clean water and market foods may mediate the dual burden at the household level. Our team will fill this gap. We will capitalize on secondary analysis of an existing dataset, the nationally-representative Encuensta National de Salud and Nutricion-Ecuador 2012 (Ensanut) and the existing partnership between the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and the Universidad San Francisco Quito (USFQ) on the Galapagos Islands to guide an exploratory, in-depth survey of 125 urban and rural households. We will incorporate biological, ecological, spatial, and survey data, to 1) examine the socioeconomic and development factors associated with household water access and diet quality, 2) test the pathways linking water and food access, quality, and security to the dual burden of OWT/NCD and UND/ID, and 3) examine whether PD mediates these pathways at the individual and household-levels. Our results will advance knowledge by: 1) describing the burden of disease in this model LMIC setting, 2) documenting the pathways linking water and food exposures to the dual burden and 3) showing how PD may contribute to UND/ID and OWT/NCD at the household-level, creating a triple burden of disease. The Galapagos Islands provide a unique opportunity to study the impact of the environmental and social changes facing LMICs impacted by migration, urbanization and shifting diet and disease burdens within a relatively closed ecosystem. Our secondary data analysis and primary data collection will inform an R01 that will scale up our novel measures (water security, water quality, and PD) to more widely examine the triple burden of disease in Ecuador. This R21 will capitalize upon an existing relationship between UNC and USFQ, build our collaborative research capacity, provide training in statistical and biomarker analysis to LMIC researchers, and improve the research infrastructure in Ecuador to permit the development of an expanded R01 project to address important health research needs and identify avenues for intervention."
"9387012","Project Summary ? Project 3 Viral diseases are remarkably heterogeneous in their presentation and clinical course. Although diseases such as Lassa Fever and Ebola Virus Disease are thought to be severe and rapidly fatal, they can often present with mild symptoms or remain asymptomatic. Host genetic variability is likely an important mediator of this heterogeneity. Complete characterization of the clinical, laboratory, and host genetic features of these illnesses is not only imperative to rapid diagnosis and effective clinical care, but also important for further scientific study. In this project, we propose to address this need through deep characterization of the clinical and laboratory features of viral disease and through study of genetic mediators of resistance to Lassa Fever and Ebola Virus Disease. In Milestone 1, we will carry out deep clinical characterization and laboratory assessment of viral febrile cases at two West African Collaborative Centers, and will use this data to develop prognostic models using cutting-edge tools in exploratory data visualization and machine learning. In Milestone 2, we will investigate host genetic factors of Lassa Fever and Ebola Virus Disease through genome-wide association studies. We will then develop field-deployable genotyping assays for the top-associated variants, and apply them in new cohorts to replicate our findings and investigate patterns of genetic resistance in clinical subgroups. This project can shed light on the clinical manifestations of viral illness and their host genetic mediators, leading to potential new insights in disease biology and pathophysiology. We will also create a rich resource of clinical, laboratory, and genetic data for these illnesses in two countries in West Africa, which will serve as a foundation for advancing the clinical care and scientific study of viral disease in the region."
"9555110","Supraphysiological GABA, the primary inhibitory neurotransmitter, can disrupt autophagy resulting in increased mitochondrial number and oxidative stress, an effect mitigated by rapalog drugs (rapamycin, Torin 1) via interaction with the autophagy regulator, mTOR (mechanistic target of rapamycin). GABA-related pathology is manifest in genetic and drug-induced states, including heritable succinate semialdehyde dehydrogenase deficiency (SSADHD), and intervention with the antiepileptic drug (AED) vigabatrin (VGB), whose irreversible inactivation of GABA-transaminase (GABA-T) is mechanistically unique among AEDs. Long-term VGB intervention (the sole FDA-approved treatment for infantile spasms), however, is curtailed due to the development of retinal toxicity. Hypothesis 1 posits that autophagic pathways involving GABA, mTOR and mitochondrial function can be mitigated with rapalogs that will provide clinical benefit in patients with heritable, or medication-induced (VGB), dysfunction of GABA-T and SSADH. Hypothesis 2 posits that rapalogs applied locally (eye), in combination with VGB, will ameliorate retinal toxicity and extend the utility of this AED. Aim 1 chronically administers VGB to wild type mice in clinically relevant dosages, followed by characterization of systemic/ocular effects and the potential of rapalogs to mitigate pathology. Aim 1a will employ visual evoked potentials (VEPs) in the visual cerebral cortex to assess VGB ocular (retinal) toxicity, while aim 1b systematically examines the retina of VGB-treated mice using light/electron microscopy and immunohistochemistry to pinpoint cell layers associated with VGB-induced toxicity. Aim 2 evaluates the efficacy of preclinical rapalog administration in a murine model of SSADHD. Aim 2a interrogates the neurobehavioral and neurophysiological effects of rapalog intervention in aldh5a1-/- mice, while aim 2b examines the efficacy of rapalogs in reversing cell signaling-autophagy-mTOR abnormalities, coupled to a preliminary in vitro assessment of drug safety and toxicity. We will employ ANOVA to understand the impact of rapalog intervention on phenotype, and their interactions, followed by adjusted post hoc t-tests. Ongoing clinical evaluation of rapalogs in patients with heritable tuberous sclerosis provides the precedent for translating our preclinical outcomes to the bedside. Pharmaceutical agents that eliminate the retinal toxicity of VGB will have enormous clinical value in epilepsy therapeutics. Such agents will also have therapeutic relevance to SSADHD, while potentially leading to novel treatment paradigms for other disorders (autism, addiction, Down syndrome) in which elevated GABA may well have pathophysiological roles, further highlighting the broad clinical impact of our proposal."
"9282293","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Carpal tunnel syndrome is the most expensive upper extremity work-related musculoskeletal disorder, impacting 10 million people annually and costing employers up to $113,695 per incident. Although many etiologic mechanisms have been identified, one set of factors cannot accurately predict carpal tunnel syndrome development. As a result, carpal tunnel syndrome interventions are often provided reactively after initial symptom reports or inefficiently to employees perceived to be at risk. As the disorder progresses, it becomes increasingly expensive to treat and functional limitations become more challenging to remediate. There is currently no established method to detect this disorder prior to the onset of symptoms and nerve damage. Preliminary research suggests that sonography-a relatively inexpensive, widely available, increasingly portable technology-can provide a non-invasive and pain-free method of early detection that could reduce incidence, improve targeted interventions and ultimately reduce costs. Sonographic imaging has been used in an animal model to observe early progressive increases in median nerve size due to task exposure. By understanding this progression in humans, it would be possible to develop an early detection technique to stop, slow, or reverse this disorder before it becomes costly and debilitating. Thus, the long-term goal of this work is to develop a model of morphologic changes predictive of the onset and development of work-related carpal tunnel syndrome. As a first step, this study will establish predictive validity of a novel method for early detection using sonographic imaging and identify task components of intensive functional hand activity associated with morphologic changes. This longitudinal study will follow dental hygiene students-a high-risk population with minimal retrospective and controlled prospective task exposure-for two years to investigate these aims. This research is directed at the National Occupational Research Agenda's (NORA) Healthcare and Social Assistance sector with a focus on the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health's (NIOSH) Exposure Assessment and Musculoskeletal Disorders cross-sectors. Intermediate outcomes of this research will establish sonographic imaging as an early detection tool for workplace-screening and inform methods for combining measures of nerve morphology, neurophysiology, and subjective symptoms for predicting the development of work-related carpal tunnel syndrome. This work will also inform the development of targeted preventive interventions for task components of intensive hand activities that are related to changes in tissue morphology. Finally, this work will provide access to a cohort of individuals who can be followed as they transition into the workforce to document the natural development of work-related musculoskeletal disorders. Identifying morphologic changes in early-stages of pathology and the specific task components linked to these changes are the first steps toward early detection and prevention of work-related carpal tunnel syndrome."
"9338112","Project Summary Although sexual violence (SV) among youth is a critical public health issue, there are few prevention initiatives that have demonstrated long-term reductions in SV. There is increasing recognition that SV prevention efforts may be most effective if youth are central to the development and implementation of such efforts. However, to date, there are no rigorously evaluated youth-led SV prevention efforts, nor how they can be best informed by research and knowledge on prevention best practices. Further, we know little about the actual process by which youth create prevention initiatives. Teen UP (TU) is a youth-led program in Rapid City, SD that focuses on addressing a variety of public health issues, including awareness about SV. This ?homegrown? positive youth development initiative is well-integrated in the community and is the ideal platform on which additional multi-level, evidence-based SV prevention strategies can be added. Researchers and SV prevention specialists at the University of New Hampshire, in partnership with Rape Prevention Education-funded agencies in South Dakota (SD) (i.e., Network Against Family Violence and Sexual Assault and Working Against Violence Inc.) will work together along with a number of community stakeholders (e.g., educators, peers, elders), youth, and expert consultants to enhance TU to include additional SV prevention strategies including a youth prevention summit. During the Refinement and Planning Phase of the project, we will form a Research and Programming Advisory Board (RPAB); obtain data via focus groups and individual interviews with stakeholders and key informants, including youth and adults from the community; and develop a detailed enhanced prevention toolkit. Together, we will document the process of using youth-adult partnerships to create and implement SV prevention across several levels of the ecological model using a variety of strategies (e.g., photovoice, social network analysis). In addition to a detailed process evaluation, we will employ a single-case multiple baseline design as well as a matched comparison design to determine the impact that engagement with and exposure to different TU enhancement components (and dosage) has on primary (i.e., reductions in SV), intermediary (e.g., perceptions of social norms, emotion regulation), and secondary (e.g., dating violence, suicidal thoughts) outcomes among middle and high school youth. We will also examine the behavioral and attitudinal impact that the enhanced TU program has on school personnel and parents of youth. If TU is deemed effective, the products (e.g., toolkits) that result from this project can be readily disseminated to communities across the U.S. who wish to implement and sustain a theoretically-grounded, multi-level, youth-led SV prevention initiative."
"9469824","(F.220) 7. Project Summary Racial/ethnic health disparities have been well-documented in the onset, rate, course, and consequences of alcohol and other drug (AOD) use problems, often with substantially poorer outcomes in non-White racial/ethnic groups compared to non-Hispanic Whites. As a result, the NIAAA has made it a central strategic aim to investigate and eliminate health disparities. Despite 30 years of research documenting the presence of AOD-related racial/ethnic health disparities, the degree to which disparities negatively impact the emerging standard of assessing the effectiveness of AOD treatments (i.e., ? 5 years AOD problem resolution),53 which is also when risk of problematic use is no higher than in the general population,84 is unknown. Publicly available datasets are very limited by their ability to directly measure AOD recovery-related constructs and national prevalence rates of non-White racial/ethnic groups who have achieved long-term problem resolution. In turn, this compromises our ability to assess the extent to which racial/ethnic health equality exists in terms of long- term AOD problem resolution and the recovery-related mechanisms associated with potential disparities. To begin to fill this knowledge gap, we propose to conduct secondary data analyses of the first recovery-focused nationally representative probability-based study to test if racial/ethnic health disparities exist. The National Recovery Study (PI: Kelly) consists of a web-based probability sampling frame of 39,809 adults who were screened to identify if they once had a problem with drugs or alcohol and no longer do. Complete data on 2,002 participants who answered ?yes? is available. Participants were assessed with a battery of quantitative and qualitative survey items in 2016 which captured their AOD clinical history and recovery-related mechanisms associated racial/ethnic health equality in AOD problem resolution. This design will enable us to address the following aims: 1a. Test if racial/ethnic health disparities exist in (i) the duration between onset of alcohol and other drug problems and onset of problem resolution; and, (ii) the likelihood of achieving long-term problem resolution (? 5 years) 1b. If health disparities are observed, explore the mediating potential of psychosocial (accrued recovery capital, degree of treatment utilization, degree of recovery support-service utilization) and structural recovery-related factors (health insurance coverage, socioeconomic status, and recovery-related discrimination) in explaining observed disparities. 2. Conduct concurrent qualitative analysis to identify the top three strategies that participants report having used to resolve their alcohol or other drug problem (e.g., social support, secure accommodations, mental and physical health, financial management, employment, and recreation) and compare these strategies according to racial/ethnic characteristics. Mix the qualitative and quantitative data to determine if race/ethnicity is associated with themes identified in the recovery strategies."
"9443341","Project Summary Middle ear infection or otitis media (OM) is the most predominant bacterial disease of childhood and results in significant morbidity in the U.S. and globally. Episodes of OM can substantially affect a child?s ability to hear normally. This loss of hearing is of great concern due to the long-term consequences on language development. Multiple different bacterial species and viruses cause middle ear infections. Nontypeable Haemophilus influenza (NTHI) is the primary bacterial pathogen of chronic OM, recurrent OM and OM wherein there is treatment failure. Several human pathogens, including NTHI, have evolved a novel genetic system, termed the phasevarion (for phase variable regulon), which mediates a rapid and reversible change in the expression of many genes throughout the chromosome. This epigenetic regulation occurs via phase variation of a single gene (modA) that encodes a DNA methyltransferase, and results in two phenotypically distinct subpopulations, ON and OFF. Our preliminary data clearly demonstrated that differences in the gene expression between these subpopulations have a significant affect on in vitro phenotypes known to be critical to the disease course of OM. We further showed that the status of the phasevarion, as well as switching from one status to the other, significantly affects disease severity in a chinchilla model of experimental OM. However, ModA2-regualted gene expression during ascension from the site of colonization, the nasopharynx, to the site of disease, the middle ear is unknown. In Specific Aim 1, we will assess site-specific expression of genes regulated by the ModA2 phasevarion in a model of ascending experimental model that mimics the disease course in children. Studies to determine gene expression within the host during experimental OM are absolutely necessary to fully understand the mechanisms by which the phasevarion contributes to both disease severity and bacterial persistence in various anatomical niches. Additionally, phasevarion regulation occurs through epigenetic methylation and cannot be discerned in silico. In Specific Aim 2, we will define immune cell recruitment, define cytokine expression profiles and identify antibodies developed against each modA2 population as well as a shift in ModA2 state over the course of disease development. A comprehensive understanding of when, where and how the phasevarion regulates expression of virulence factors combined with subsequent host immune responses to these changes in NTHI gene expression is required for the development of optimal disease treatment and prevention strategies. We expect to contribute significantly to this improved understanding of the role of the phasevarion in bacterial-host interactions via successful completion of Specific Aims of this proposal."
"9336962","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long term goal of our ongoing project, Discovering and applying knowledge in clinical databases, is to learn from data in the electronic health record (EHR) and to apply that knowledge to relevant problems. The advent of the electronic health record (EHR) greatly amplifies the ability to carry out observational research, opening the possibility of covering emerging problems, diverse populations, rare diseases, and chronic diseases in long-term longitudinal studies. Unfortunately, the EHR carries additional challenges. We believe that the biggest challenge comes from the inaccuracy, incompleteness, complexity, and resulting bias inherent in the recording of the health care process. Put another way, EHR data are not simply research data with more noise and missing some values; instead the EHR carries systematic biases that must be addressed before the data can reach their potential. We propose to characterize the effects of the health care process on EHR data, to enumerate the potential biases, and to provide mechanisms to circumvent them. In effect, we propose to study the EHR as an object of interest in itself, using new models, data mining, existing knowledge bases, and innovative algorithms to better understand EHR biases so that we can identify them and correct them or avoid them. We include expertise from two of the nation's major phenotyping projects, eMERGE and OMOP.     We hypothesize that we can learn about biases due to the health process through data mining and knowledge engineering and that we can correct or at least avoid those biases, enabling us to better answer informatics and clinical questions. Our aims are as follows: (1) Study health care process biases by correlating raw EHR variables with a panel of health care process-related variables (e.g., admission), using lagged correlation to account for temporal effects, and populating a health care process resource with the correlations and observations. (2) Find associations among raw EHR variables using lagged correlation, information theory, Granger causality, and temporally ordered N-tuples of events, correcting for the health care process biases discovered in Aim 1. (3) Facilitate the definition of higher-level clinical phenotype concepts by applying knowledge resources-including eMERGE and OMOP phenotype definitions and ontologies such as our Medical Entities Dictionary and the UMLS-to the fruit of Aims 1 and 2 to produce semi-automated and automated phenotype query definitions. (4) Develop a high-throughput method to validate phenotype definitions by measuring the ability to uncover known associations, use the generated phenotypes and associations to answer clinical questions, and disseminate the results, including a large knowledge base of correlations that can be used by other researchers to conduct their own studies."
"9318653","Summary This proposal focuses on UBQLN2, missense mutations in which cause dominant inheritance of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis with frontotemporal dementia (ALS-FTD). UBQLN proteins facilitate clearance of misfolded proteins from cells through the autophagy and proteasome degradation pathways, including in ER-associated degradation (ERAD). Disturbances in ERAD lead to induction of ER stress, chronic induction of which is implicated in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases, including ALS. There is growing appreciation that ER stress may be involved in ALS pathogenesis because targeting of elements that regulate this signaling response can alleviate disease. However, we not only lack good understanding of the underlying mechanisms by which mutations in ALS genes trigger ER stress, but also good animal models of the mutations. We recently generated transgenic mice lines that express either wild type (WT) or the P497S or P506T UBQLN2 mutations that cause ALS-FTD. The lines expressing the UBQLN2 mutations develop motor neuron disease and cognitive deficits, recapitulating key features of the human disease. By contrast, the WT lines are devoid of disease. Examination of protein changes in the spinal cord of early and the end-stage mutant UBQLN2 lines revealed robust elevation of ER stress and autophagy markers, suggesting protein homeostasis has been perturbed. ER stress triggers the activation of Ire1?, PERK and ATF6 signaling pathways, collectively called the unfolded protein response (UPR). There are two phases of UPR: an adaptive phase, where attempts are made to restore protein homeostasis, which, if unsuccessful, triggers a terminal cell death phase. Studies have shown that genetic or pharmacological methods that prolong the adaptive phase, or which block the cell death phase, delay disease in SOD1 mouse models of ALS. In this application we will utilize similar strategies to directly test whether modulation of UPR signaling, or autophagy, will alleviate disease in our UBQLN2 mouse models of ALS-FTD. There are six aims. In Aim 1 we will use in vitro cell and biochemical assays to gain mechanistic insight into how UBQLN2 mutations interfere with ERAD. In Aim 2 we will evaluate if prolongation of the adaptive phase of ER stress, by genetic deletion of GADD34, alleviates disease symptoms in mice carrying the P497S UBQLN2 mutation. In Aim 2 we will evaluate if genetic deletion of CHOP, a molecule involved in execution of cell death, alleviates disease in mutant P497S mice. In Aim 4 we will evaluate whether genetic deletion of ASK1, a kinase that acts downstream of Ire1? to drive cell death signaling, alleviates disease in P497S mutant mice. In Aim 5 we will assess if enhancement of autophagy will alleviate any disease in our UBQLN2 lines. In Aim 6 we will use co-culture experiments to determine if astrocytes from our UBQLN2 mouse models can induce non-cell autonomous death of MN. The results of this research will provide important insight into the underlying mechanisms by which UBQLN2 mutations cause disease, the lessons of which could be exploited for therapeutic intervention in ALS-FTD."

"9353307","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  We are proposing to establish the Brain Health Patient Safety Learning Laboratory (Brain Safety Lab) at the Indiana University School of Medicine in collaboration with the Indiana University School of Informatics and Computing, The Indiana University School of Nursing, The Purdue University Schools of Biomedical and Industrial Engineering, the Purdue College of Pharmacy, the Regenstrief Institute, Inc., and a safety net health care system, Eskenazi Health.  The Brain Safety Lab will allow this new professional network to brainstorm about solutions to brain safety and to rapidly deploy and test novel ideas in real-world clinical settings serving vulnerable elders.  Vulnerable elders, includin low-income and minority elders and those who suffer from multimorbility, are AHQ priority populations            The specific aim of this proposal is to establish a patient safety learning laboratory focused on preventing harms to brain health among an AHRQ priority population at high risk for avoidable harm.          Brain health is one of the highest priorities for successful aging.  Brain health includes both cognitive and emotional health as well as positive sense of well-being.  Within the context of brain health, we will focus initially on patient safety harms related to the use of medications among older adults.  Use of medications that have the potential to harm brain health is widely accepted as a patient safety problem that has been resistant to early intervention efforts.  The institute of Medicine recently issued a report on cognitive aging that included a call for joint an collaborative actions among policy-makers, health care professionals, patients, and families to review patient medications, paying attention to medications known to have an impact on cognition.  We focus on older adults because they are the largest reservoir of medication use, over-use, and misuse and are particularly vulnerable to brain safety concerns."
"9565690","ABSTRACT The goal of this project is two-fold: 1) to determine how age compounds the effect of myocardial infarct (MI) on heart function and how this affects skeletal muscle function and exercise tolerance; and 2) to determine the ability of 2 deoxy-ATP (dATP) to affect heart and skeletal muscle performance, metabolism and exercise tolerance in age and MI induced heart failure. Most studies of performance decline with MI are done with young animal models, to look at infarct specific effects. However, MI occurs most often in the elderly, and it is not clear the extent to which this compounds pathologic effects at the system, organ and cell levels. Thus, we will study how age impacts the effects of MI on heart and skeletal muscle contractile and metabolic function. We will then use this model to study cardiac-specific vs. cardiac + skeletal muscle elevation of dATP. We have previously reported that dATP enhances contraction in demembranated cardiac and skeletal muscle by increasing myosin binding to actin (crossbridge formation) and crossbridge cycling. We have also reported that cellular levels of dATP can be elevated in the heart and skeletal muscle via transgenic or viral vector-mediated or over-expression of the enzyme Ribonucleotide Reductase (RNR). Both of these approaches enhance left ventricular (LV) heart function and increases the magnitude and speed of cardiomyocyte contraction & relaxation in normal hearts and rescues LV function of infarcted hearts of rodents and pigs. These previous MI studies were done in young adult animal and we did not determine how cardiac-specific elevation of dATP affected skeletal muscle or exercise tolerance. In preliminary data we demonstrate that 1) both demembranated cardiac and skeletal muscle from old mice have enhanced contraction when dATP (vs. ATP) is the substrate for contraction, 2) transgenic young mice with elevated heart and skeletal muscle [dATP] have greater exercise capacity, faster treadmill running and fatigue resistance, and 3) elevated cardiac RNR and dATP may protect against transition from an oxidative to glycolytic cardiac metabolic profile following MI (in young mice) and rescue this `more youthful' oxidative profile in old mice. In the proposed experiments we will determine if AAV-RNR vectors can improve cardiac and skeletal muscle performance, exercise capacity and metabolic performance of old mice with and without MI. We will compare vectors with cardiac-specific vs. striated muscle-specific expression of RNR. Thus our proposal offers a unique model to study how specifically targeting the heart to improve its performance can have secondary beneficial effects in skeletal muscle. Function will be measured at whole organ, cell and myofibril levels for both cardiac and skeletal muscle and coupled with measures of metabolic efficiency and activity, mitochondrial function, and metabolomics and proteomic analysis. This multi- scale analysis, using interdisciplinary approaches, will provide information for mechanistic interpretations. The results from these studies will determine feasibility of our approach (AAV-RNR mediated elevation of dATP in muscle) for treatment of heart failure and other age-related declines in cardiac function and exercise tolerance."
"9332103","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The SEARCH for Diabetes in Youth Study documented a 31% increase in the prevalence of type 2 diabetes (T2D) between 2001 and 2009, as well as an increase of 21 % in the prevalence of type 1 diabetes (T1D) in youth diagnosed at age<20. Increases occurred across most but not all major subgroups of age, sex and race/ethnicity. Further, we documented an annual increase in the incidence of T1D among non-Hispanic white youth of approximately 2.7% per year. In contrast, studies from Europe suggest that incidence of T1D may be stabilizing. Ongoing, efficient surveillance of diabetes diagnosed in youth is essential to inform health care systems and generate testable hypotheses related to the natural history of diabetes in youth. SEARCH is uniquely positioned to address these critical questions through continued surveillance of childhood diabetes employing our well-established infrastructure for surveillance, and our highly experienced, collaborative and multi-disciplinary investigative team. Therefore, in response to RFA-DP-15-002, Component B, we propose the continuation of the SEARCH for Diabetes in Youth Registry Study (SEARCH Phase 4) during which we will continue to serve as the Coordinating Center (CC). Our approach is informed by our substantial accrued experience that allows us to provide statistical and operational leadership in a highly efficient manner. The overarching aim of the CC is to support the population based registries of Component A described in the RFA, specifically the activities of the surveillance network and the validation of diabetes cases. The main objectives of the registries are to ascertain, among youth diagnosed at age < 20 years, cases of prevalent diabetes in calendar year 2017; ascertain newly diagnosed (2015-2020) incident diabetes cases; confirm classification of diabetes type using biochemical markers; and optimize efficiency of the surveillance activities through targeted projects designed to utilize relevant electronic health data. The main objectives of the CC to support the surveillance network are to: (1) Maintain a central data repository and create protocols and mechanisms to secure transmission of data and relevant data management reports between the CC and the registry sites; (2) Ensure the training and certification of staff on measurements and procedures as outlined in the protocol and manual of operations; (3) Provide expertise and leadership in population-based surveillance development, methodology, implementation, and evaluation; (4) Provide statistical and other analytic support to the registry network; (5) Provide for a central laboratory for the analysis of biological specimens; (6) Provide operational support to the registry network (communication and meetings). The main objectives of the CC to support the validation of diabetes cases are to: (1) Develop analytic methods for case validation; (2) Provide statistical/analytic support for validation analysis; (3) Maintain diabetes case validation protocols. Thus, the CC is uniquely positioned to provide leadership in statistical and operational issues that will support continued collection of data on the prevalence, incidence and early clinical course of diabetes in youth."
"9380415","Fetal growth restriction is an important risk factor for future child and adult morbidity and mortality. Thus, un- derstanding biological mechanisms and preventing exposures during pregnancy that can impact fetal growth have important implications for future child and adult health. Outdoor air pollution has been deemed a signifi- cant health risk contributing annually to 3.2 million premature deaths and 76 million years of healthy life lost globally. Work by our group and others have shown associations between increased air pollution and de- creased birth weight (a proxy of fetal growth restriction). In our previous R01 study, we found that when the ambient concentrations of particulate matter and gaseous pollutants were substantially reduced during the 2008 Beijing Olympics (August 8-September 24; 47 days), babies born to pregnant women living in Beijing whose 8th month of pregnancy was during this period, were 23g (95% CI = 5g, 40g) larger than babies born to pregnant women with their 8th month of pregnancy during the same calendar dates in 2007 or 2009. However, the biological mechanisms by which late pregnancy exposure may impair fetal growth (hence birth weight) are largely unknown to date. It is well appreciated that oxidative stress and inflammation can alter growth and de- velopment in utero, with both associated with preeclampsia and fetal growth restriction. Metabolic deficiencies have also been associated with fetal growth restriction. A factor that may mediate interactions between these pathways is the growth and development of the placenta, the conduit, controller, and anchor for the growth and development of the fetus. Alterations in placental growth and circulatory pattern development may have pro- found impacts on the growth of the fetus. Fetal growth is also controlled in part by genes that are genomically imprinted, a unique form of epigenetic regulation resulting in parent-of-origin-dependent methylation and ex- pression. Imprinted genes play a substantial role in placental function, including regulation of nutrient ex- change. With an overall goal to understand the pathophysiologic pathways linking air pollution and birth weight, we propose to enroll 660 newly pregnant women in Beijing, and measure biomarkers of these pathways in ma- ternal blood or urine at 5 visits during pregnancy and at birth, and in cord blood and placental tissue at birth. We will measure internal doses of combustion-generated pollutants at the same visits, and estimate address- specific ambient concentrations of air pollutants throughout pregnancy, to assess personal pollutant expo- sures. The multiple exposure metrics representing different exposure durations allow us to examine critical time windows during which pollutants may have strong effects on biomarkers and birth weight. This will be the first study to simultaneously examine whether air pollution induces changes in biomarkers of these pathways in pregnant women, the placenta, and/or the fetus, the first study to examine effects of air pollution on epigenetic regulation of critical growth regulatory genes in the placenta, and the first to explore whether these pathways mediate any birth weight (i.e. fetal growth) response to air pollution exposure."
"9321596","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The New York State Department of Health (NYSDOH) has been a leader in protecting and advancing the health of New Yorkers through a comprehensive network of public health activities and services. The complexity of the state, from densely populated urban, to rural and suburban areas, the diversity of the state with respect to race, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status, warrants a public health system that is comprehensive and flexible to govern the state's public health successfully. Since the EHS-Net's inception in 2000, there have been a number of critical barriers to overcome. In regards to foodborne outbreak situations and environmental assessments, the geographic size of NYS can be challenging when coordinating a rapid and effective response. Over the past number of years, some state and local departments have experienced as much as a 30% reduction in staff due to retirements and attrition. To overcome these barriers, in part, the specific aims of this project involves engaging and strengthening the partnership with other State and local partners from environmental health, disease surveillance and laboratory authorities to improve environmental assessment data collection and foodborne disease outbreak investigations, establish and implement program evaluations and compare to national standards and disseminate educational materials to the public through a variety of mechanisms. This will allow Local Health Departments (LHDs) and State personnel from numerous agencies to apply best practices and interventions using national standards and new forms of technology identified by EHS-Net, the Council to Improve Foodborne Outbreak Response (CIFOR), Centers of Excellence and other Rapid Response Teams (RRT) to improve the overall health and safety of New Yorkers. The nature of outbreaks and investigations has changed considerably with the implementation of new laboratory techniques such as pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS). Sporadic cases of illness across many jurisdictions can now be linked to a common source by using PFGE technology and WGS, the complete DNA make-up of an organism can be determined to enable us to better understand variations both within and between species. These new technologies, including computerized sharing of information, will allow us to perform basic foodborne pathogen identification during foodborne illness outbreaks and apply it in novel ways that have the potential to help reduce foodborne illness. The use of these technologies and our collaboration across programs will improve investigations of illness clusters or outbreaks."
"9338115","Project Summary/Abstract Sexual violence (SV) is a highly prevalent, significant public health problem resulting in serious health, economic, and social consequences. Like other forms of violence, SV is preventable. Through its Rape Prevention and Education (RPE) program, the CDC has funded states to strengthen the SV prevention efforts of community organizations. However, the evidence base for these efforts is weak, and how best to prevent SV perpetration remains unclear. Our study will rigorously evaluate an ongoing RPE-funded program, Wise Guys: The Next Level (WGNL), which addresses SV perpetration by addressing known risk and protective factors, such as rape culture and unhealthy masculinity, gender stereotyping, communication and consent in relationships. WGNL is based on an evidence-informed theory of change and is implemented by Children's Home Society of North Carolina (CHSNC), a well-established community-based organization that has been working with men and boys since the 1990s. CHS currently implements WGNL in numerous sites that serve boys and young men at high risk for SV perpetration. In Year 1, our research team will work with CHSNC and the North Carolina Coalition Against Sexual Assault, as well as our Research Advisory Board, to identify, refine, and document the core components and activities of WGNL and formalize its implementation by CHSNC personnel. In Years 2 to 4, we will use a cluster-randomized design to randomize WGNL implementation by site and time. A total of 520 participants will be enrolled. Participants will be evaluated at pre-program (baseline), immediate post-program (2-month), and 12-month follow-up. The evaluation will be designed to measure the effect of WGNL on the primary outcome of preventing SV perpetration and, secondarily, on preventing dating violence, bullying, sexual risk behavior, and harassment. We will document the implementation costs of WGNL to inform future research and SV prevention interventions. Our proposed research addresses several research priorities identified in the CDC Injury Research Agenda for 2009-2018, including ?evaluating approaches to prevent SV that target high-risk populations and shared risk factors with other health outcomes? and ?evaluating the effectiveness of SV prevention approaches with substantial uptake and informed by evidence, but without evaluation research evidence.? Our research team has a long history of collaboration with practitioners in the SV prevention community. Our use of a practice-informed evidence research paradigm will optimize dissemination of study results to the practitioner community, and increase the probability that this program, if found to be effective, can replicated with fidelity and sustainability in other communities."
"9444898","PROJECT SUMMARY ? Overall Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is one of the most common hematologic malignancies, representing a diverse collection of complex diseases. Treatment strategies for AML have not changed in 30-40 years. Single-agent targeted therapies based on AML genetics or microenvironmental disease features have been disappointing, at best. The investigators on this DRSC Program, Drug Combinations to Circumvent Resistance (D2CR), have collaborated for over a decade and have developed functional genomic pipelines for evaluation of primary AML patient samples that have collectively led to numerous discoveries with diagnostic and therapeutic implications. For this Program, our long-term goals are to translate effective drug combinations that target tumor- intrinsic and microenvironmental pathways into the clinic for patients with AML. Our immediate goals are to prioritize the most relevant tumor-intrinsic and microenvironmental pathways for each AML disease subset and establish sufficient preclinical data to facilitate immediate clinical investigation of drug combinations. Based on the central hypothesis that drug combinations targeting tumor intrinsic and extrinsic features of AML biology will be essential to the development of more effective and durable therapeutic strategies, we predict that the drug combinations established by this D2CR-DRSC Program will substantially improve outcomes for patients with AML. To accomplish these goals, 3 Projects are proposed: 1) What are the tumor-intrinsic genes and pathways that contribute to drug sensitivity and resistance? Genome-wide CRISPR/Cas screens on parental and drug-resistant AML cells will be integrated with computational analysis of the largest functional genomic AML cohort in the world. The result will nominate genes/pathways for validation on patient samples in gene-edited models and for drug combination studies in Project 3. 2) What are the tumor-extrinsic pathways promoting tumor cell growth, drug resistance, and immune suppression? Inflammatory cytokine profiling of our large bank of AML patient samples will be conducted. Our bank of AML patient bone marrow stromal cells will also be accessed for studies of the reactive signature of these stromal cells when exposed to specific drugs. Finally, high-parameter immunophenotyping and T-cell functional assays will be used to define the immune landscape with candidate drugs tested in an immune-competent, spontaneous mouse model of AML. Candidate targets will be nominated for combination studies with tumor-intrinsic targets. 3) What are the drug combinations that most effectively bridge tumor- intrinsic and microenvironmental biology to eliminate AML cells and circumvent resistance? Drug combinations from targets nominated in Project 1 and 2 will be tested ex vivo on primary AML patient samples and in vivo using AML patient-derived xenografts. Cumulatively, we expect these innovative analyses to have a major impact on our understanding of AML biology, with successful clinical translation of new, more effective drug combination strategies."
"9330914","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Trauma is the number one cause of death among people younger than 44 years of age, and 33% of all traumatic deaths are attributed to aortic injuries within the thorax. Endovascular reconstruction of traumatized aorta using stent-grafts has evolved as a first line therapy for trauma patients, but these stent-grafts were designed for elderly patients with chronic degenerative arterial diseases and are less than ideal for the smaller and more angulated thoracic aortas of young patients. In addition, the increased patient activity and high cyclic loads imposed by more dynamic younger cardiovascular systems may push stent-graft materials to failure resulting in higher morbidity, mortality and expensive reinterventions over the course of a lifetime. The goal of this project is to create a computationa tool that can determine the optimal stent-graft characteristics for the aorta of trauma patients and the mechanical behavior of the implanted stent-grafts over the long-term. This tool will be able to measure the conformability of the stent-graft when implanted in the young thoracic aorta and the long-term durability of the stent-graft as determined by its capability to withstand high-cycle fatigue loads. We propose to accomplish this by three Specific Aims: In Aim 1 we will determine the morphometric features of the thoracic aorta in different young trauma populations (<20, 20-29, 30-45 years old) that are critical for stent-graft deployment using comprehensive 3D arterial reconstructions derived from thin-section CTA scans. In Aim 2 we will build in silico models of stent-grafts deployed in the aortas of young trauma patients using biaxial mechanical properties of thoracic aortic wall obtained from tissue donors of each age group, and experimentally determined mechanical properties of two stent-grafts (GORE C-Tag and Medtronic Valiant) that are currently approved for trauma. We will then use mathematical modeling to subject the stent-grafts to typical cyclic physiologic loads and assess the resulting stress-strain fields. In Aim 3 we will determine stent-graft conformability to the inner aortic wal when subjected to simulated in vivo loads, and long-term durability as determined by the capability of the device to withstand high-cycle fatigue loads assessed by using stress analysis and Goodman diagrams. These data will be acquired for each trauma population to identify specific characteristics of the devices that may enhance the acute and long-term outcomes of endovascular treatments in each trauma group. The proposed study will lay the foundation for in silico comparative effectiveness studies for existing and yet-to-be developed endovascular devices for young patient populations and will set new standards for analysis of trauma-oriented endovascular devices, facilitating the development of better stent-grafts. This work will promote integration of the applicant into the biomedical field and enhance her potential for independent research career while carving out an excellent niche for her to pursue independent funding in the future."

"9353758","Project Summary/Abstract: We will design and implement a health information technology-enabled system to improve care coordination following an inpatient admission or emergency department visit. Care coordination is required in the absence of continuity of care or when care is fragmented. Americans increasingly live with chronic diseases, and receive care in regions where care is fragmented across care systems and providers. Despite the increasing ubiquity of electronic health records, these systems are often unable to support coordination between clinicians and settings. Resulting failures in care coordination result in billions of dollars in wasteful spending, including outcomes such as hospital readmissions. Although selected care coordination interventions can reduce hospital admissions and improve patient-reported outcomes in chronically ill populations, care coordination programs often fail to achieve their stated objectives and are not globally cost saving. New, potentially replicable approaches to coordinating care are therefore urgently needed. Smartphones may offer a new, more nimble approach to information transfer that facilitates care coordination. Location-sensing technologies are already used in a host of smartphone applications (apps), and have the potential to reliably detect when patients receive care at any hospital or emergency department based on a phone?s Global Positioning System (GPS) coordinates. Following exploratory research by our team, the proposed study will develop and test a new system for care coordination in which a smartphone app sends location-based alerts to care managers at a federally qualified health center when their high-risk patients receive care at a regional hospital or emergency room. We will use a ?hybrid effectiveness- implementation? design in which our primary research questions focus on intervention impact and our secondary research questions focus on barriers and facilitators to implementation. The aims of this study are to: 1) Develop a care coordination system in which a novel smartphone app, CHASER (Coordinating Hospital And emergency use with Smartphone-Enabled Reminders), facilitates information transfer and care coordination following inpatient admissions and emergency visits, and; 2) Conduct a feasibility study examining the system?s preliminary impacts and implementation in a care management program for high-risk patients."
"9434136","PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT Adults with severe mental illness (SMI) are three times more likely to smoke than non-SMI adults, consuming 35-44% of all cigarettes in the U.S.; and, the highest rates of tobacco-related illnesses and death are among smokers with schizophrenia. Unfortunately, not only are patients with schizophrenia less likely to receive smoking treatments, but cessation medications are only modestly effective in helping this subset of smokers quit. Therefore, it is vital to discover new treatment adjuncts that specifically aid this high- risk subset of smokers to achieve successful abstinence. Toward that end, we propose a novel non- pharmacologic technique that directly targets both cognitive impairment, an avenue considerable past research suggests may be particularly effective to exploit in smokers with schizophrenia, and reactivity to prepotent stimuli, shown to be enhanced in smokers with schizophrenia. Combining a subset of cognitive enhancement therapy known as Cognitive Remediation (CR), with another safe and effective technique, Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS), we propose a new cognitive training method aimed at enabling smokers with schizophrenia to gain greater control over smoking and stimuli-induced reactivity (e.g., craving). Recent studies have found significant tDCS-induced cognitive enhancement, as well as reduction in both cue-induced craving and smoking behavior among healthy smokers. This combined with knowledge of the cognitive deficits that exist among individuals with schizophrenia, and clear evidence of a relationship between cognitive function and smoking treatment success, provides the rationale for testing novel CR + tDCS to target underlying mechanisms of smoking among individuals with schizophrenia. Specifically, the proposed study will examine the extent to which targeted cognitive enhancement with CR + tDCS, leads to changes in cognitive control, cue-provoked craving, reaction time and ERP measures of attentional bias; as well as the impact of these changes on smoking behavior and intention and confidence to quit among 80 smokers with schizophrenia. The goal of this study is to inform the development of new non-medication, noninvasive, therapeutic techniques to specifically target smoking among patients with schizophrenia. Our long term goal is to establish an effective treatment adjunct to help smokers with schizophrenia successfully achieve abstinence."
"9565687","Program Director/Principal Investigator (Last, First, Middle): Ochsner, Kevin N. By 2040, the number of adults aged 65+ is expected to comprise approximately 22% of the U.S. population1. Given this 175% increase in the older adult population, it is imperative that basic research expand the evidence base concerning normative age-related maturational shifts in emotion regulation processes ? processes that support adaptive responding to life stressors and promote health and well-being. RFA-MH-17-405 calls for exactly this type of research, with a key question concerning what mechanisms underlie the paradoxical finding that health and cognitive abilities decline with age but older adults report more positive emotion in their daily lives and preferentially attend to and remember positive stimuli and events. Emotion regulation has been advanced as a possible key factor underlying this positivity bias. Studies now show that older adults can effectively use certain classes of regulatory strategies, including situation-focused, attentional, and response- focused strategies. Although early studies appeared to show age-related impairments in older adults use of the powerful and widely deployable cognitive strategy reappraisal, our recent pilot studies show that this depends on how one reappraises: older adults are less able to cognitively minimize the impact of negative events but can positivize their reponses by finding positive meaning in them. Evolving models of emotion regulation from our lab and others suggest a major limitation of such work, however: It focuses exclusively on the ability to implement regulatory strategies when instructed to do so, and ignores two critical processing stages that may necessarily precede strategy implementation: First, the identification of one's current emotional state and second, the decision whether and how to change this state. To date, little to no attention has been paid to potential age-related changes in these two key regulatory stages. In three Aims, this grant will test this evolving model and address these critical gaps in knowledge. Aim 1 will combine fMRI with a novel psychophyisical task to ask how different ways of identifying you emotions can have different emotion regulatory effects for older vs. younger adults. Aim 2 will use a novel variant of our established fMRI methods for studying reappraisal to ask whether and how older and younger adults differ in decisions to reappraise, and if so, using minimizing vs. positivizing reappraisals. Exploratory Aim 3 attempts to connect these lab-based behavioral and brain markers of emotional response and regulation to measures of daily emotional experience and regulatory goals as assessed using ecological momentary assessment (EMA). Together, the proposed research could provide new answers for the emotion paradox of aging ? suggesting that the positivity bias could arise in part from age- related differences in the unappreciated regulatory effects of identifying your emotions and the ways decisions are made to regulate those emotions. In so doing, we will broaden the knowledge base concerning the psychological and neural underpinnings of emotion regulation and how they change across the lifespan, with implications for designing possible future interventions to improve emotional well-being.

"9513857","Abstract  Polymorphic antigens on RBCs contribute to the high incidence of allo-immunization and to the presence of multiple antibodies in the serum of sickle cell disease (SCD) patients. Identifying the specificity of these antibodies is critical for providing compatible blood. However, the current process can be complex, involve costly reference laboratory testing, lacks standardization, and is hampered by the lack of suitable reagent RBCs for timely provision of transfusion service. The major goals of the parent application to this revision application are to develop a panel of reagent cultured RBCs (cRBCs) specifically targeted for SCD patients to identify the presence of clinically significant antibodies to donor antigens. This panel of reagent cRBCs will be produced from iPSCs derived from donors carrying rare blood groups. We have made significant progress toward this goal and are now proposing to expand the scope of the parent application by accomplishing three novel Aims. In Aim 1, we propose to optimize cRBC production in a stirred mini-bioreactor setting which has become affordable because we have developed R5, an inexpensive, chemically-defined, albumin-free medium to differentiate erythroid progenitors into enucleated RBCs. In Aim 2, we will characterize in details and optimize the growth conditions of the 704D cell line, an iPSC-derived immortalized erythroid cell line that can differentiate into cRBCs that we recently developed by targeting dCAS9-VP64 to the promoter of an endogenous immortalizing gene to activate it in an inducible manner. The 704D cell line was generated by transducing iPSCs with lentiviral vectors leading to variable expression levels of the transduced genes. In order to generate a panel of immortalized erythroblasts that can be used to produce RBCs, we need to reproducibly engineer cell lines similar to 704D from each of the donors that constitute our proposed panel of cRBCs. We propose in Aim 3 to generate these cell lines using a site-specific integration approach that obviate the problems associated with lentiviruses. Accomplishments of these three Aims will accelerate the development of our panel of reagent cRBCs."
"9455391","Project Summary Human and animal data indicate that the hippocampus encodes events and the spatial context in which they occur. To understand how this is accomplished, we will use a systems-level approach that compares and contrasts the function of specialized microcircuits within the mouse hippocampus. We will focus on the proximal and distal segments of CA1, which are thought to encode an animal?s spatial location and the location of objects in the environment. To control the activity of these regions during behavior, we will develop new genetic tools that can be used to express the inhibitory opsin ArchT in specified segments of CA1. Targeted laser stimulation will then be used to silence these segments during newly developed place and object learning tasks. We predict that visuospatial learning will require activity in proximal CA1 while object learning will require activity in distal CA1. The information gained from these analyses will improve our models of hippocampal organization and allow us to better understand how this structure stores and retrieves distinct types of memory. In addition, these tools can be used in mouse models of human disease to modify activity or control gene expression in distinct segments of the hippocampus."

Core B Leader, Dr. Wang, and Co-Leader, Dr. Baladandayuthapani, have been working closely and synergistically for several years with core and projects leaders and co-leaders, and are capable of supporting study designs, data analysis, and management of data resources of the entire PDTC program. Core B will use robust IT structure and an extensive computing environment that includes Windows, Unix/Linux, Mac OS X, and two quad-processor Sun SPARC SMP systems. In addition, Core B will rely on two primary institutional computing resources, an HPC cluster of 336 compute nodes (each node with 32GB RAM; 1.3 GB RAM per core) with dual, 12-core Opteron processors (8,064 CPUs total), and an Itanium-2 SMP compute server with 32CPUs and 128GB RAM. The core Leader and Co-Leader have built various pipelines for sequencing data and protein expression data processing and analysis, which will be applied to analyze data. Standard design principles and statistical algorithms will be used and new methods will be developed as needed. These include: a) Parametric and nonparametric methods for estimation and hypothesis testing; b) Linear models and generalized additive models to find the best models that fit complex data structures; c) Kaplan-Meier method to estimate the distributions of time-to-event outcomes; d) Log-rank test to compare the distributions among different PDX groups; and e) Proportional hazards models to test for PDXs treatment with single drugs and combinations. Drs. Wang and Baladandayuthapani will work closely with UTPDTC investigators to facilitate hypothesis testing across projects by integrating datasets from multiple laboratories using various algorithms, including principal components, partial least squares, and Bayesian network-based models. Data analyses will be performed using R and Bioconductor packages. The Core will document all the analyses and produce HTML or PDF reports (using R packages: Sweave, knitR, and R markdown)."
"9547114","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Humans and other advanced animals have an impressive capacity to recognize the behavioral significance, or category membership, of a wide range of sensory stimuli. This ability, which is disrupted by a number of brain diseases and conditions such as Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia, stroke, and attention deficit disorder, is critical because it allows us to respond appropriately to the continuous stream of stimuli and events that we encounter in our interactions with the environment. Of course, we are not born with a built in library of meaningful categories, such as tables and chairs, which we are preprogrammed to recognize. Instead, we learn to recognize the meaning of such stimuli through experience. The goal of the studies proposed here is to move towards a more detailed understanding of the brain mechanisms underlying the learning and recognition visual categories. Recently, we found evidence that the posterior parietal cortex plays a surprisingly direct role in encoding the category membership of visual stimuli. In these studies, we recorded from neurons in the parietal cortex during performance of a categorization task in which 360 degrees of motion directions were grouped into two arbitrary categories that were divided by a learned category boundary. These recordings revealed that parietal neurons robustly encoded stimuli according to their learned category membership, suggesting that parietal visual representations can reflect abstract information about the learned significance of visual stimuli. The goals of the proposed studies are to develop a mechanistic understanding of how visual feature representations in visual cortex are transformed into category encoding in parietal cortex, and to determine how neuronal category signals develop in real time during the category learning process. While much is known about how the brain processes simple sensory features (such as color, orientation, and direction of motion), less is known about how the brain learns and represents the meaning, or category, of stimuli. A greater understanding of visual learning and categorization is critical for addressing a number of brain diseases and conditions (e.g. stroke, Alzheimer's disease, attention deficit disorder, schizophrenia, and stroke) that leave patients impaired in everyday tasks that require visual learning, recognition and/or evaluating and responding appropriately to sensory information. The long-term goal of this project is to guide the next generation of treatments for these brain-based diseases and disorders by helping to develop a detailed understanding of the brain mechanisms that underlie learning, memory and recognition. These studies also have relevance for understanding and addressing learning disabilities, such as attention deficit disorder and dyslexia, which affect a substantial fraction f school age children and young adults. Thus, a more detailed understanding of the basic brain mechanisms underlying learning and attention will likely give important insights into the causes and potential treatments for disorders involving these cognitive faculties."
"9353305","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The quality of surgical care varies widely in the United States, and identifying appropriate quality indicators is essential. Our current paradigm of quality assessment in surgery primarily focuses on clinical outcomes, such as complication rates, mortality, and readmission. This approach effectively captures perioperative safety and technical performance, but overlooks the patient perspective. Patient-reported outcomes (PROs), such as self-reported health status, function, and quality of life, could offer a more complete assessment of quality. However, little is known about their potential as a quality metric. This proposal will explore the determinants of variation in PROs at the hospital and surgeon level, their advantages and limitations as an indicator of quality, and their value and application for patients considering surgery. In addition to the innovative research plan, this proposal will provide the career development candidate (Dr. Jennifer Waljee) with a rich methodological training and mentorship experience. The research proposal focuses specifically on the variation of PROs at the population level for four surgical conditions: bariatric, urologic, wrist, and spine surgery. These conditions were chosen from the regional surgical collaborative quality improvement programs led by the University of Michigan at the Center for Healthcare Outcomes and Policy with funding from the Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Michigan/Blue Care Network. Each of these collaborative programs gathers clinical and patient-reported data from patients undergoing surgery from each participating hospital, and is a unique clinical laboratory to study PROs across hospitals and surgeons on a population-based level. The proposal's research aims include (1) examining the variation in PROs across hospitals and surgeons, and the patient, surgeon, and hospital-level factors that drive this variation; (2) the extent to which PROs are independent measures of quality compared with clinical outcomes; and (3) the way in which patients might use PROs in conjunction with clinical outcomes as measures of hospital and surgeon performance. This project, the multidisciplinary mentorship team, and the research environment are ideally suited to address the career goals and educational needs of Dr. Waljee. Her prior research experience examining PROs following surgery has prepared her to conduct the work outlined in this proposal. However, to achieve her career goal of improving quality assessment in surgery by integrating patient reported outcomes as performance measures, she will need additional training. Her educational goals, including obtaining expertise in survey research, advanced statistical methods for comparing provider performance, and approaches to healthcare organization and policy, are feasible with the grant's educational plan and highly accomplished mentorship team. This proposal includes graduate-level courses in each educational component as well as interactive research seminars and one-on-one mentorship through project-based learning. In summary, this research project, mentorship team, and educational plan will lay the groundwork for Dr. Waljee to perform ongoing and innovative research to improve quality assessment in surgery, and mature as an independent surgeon scientist."
"9564583","Genome-wide microarray and RNA sequencing studies have revealed changes in the expression of hundreds of genes during aging in diverse organisms. Transcriptional regulation clearly plays an important role in the control of gene expression during aging; however, translation efficiency likely plays an equally important role in determining protein abundance, but has been woefully understudied in this context. Here we propose to study translational changes that are associated with increased longevity and examine the mechanisms of post- transcriptional gene regulation in aging using yeast as a model system. We will test the hypothesis that, in re- sponse to genetic alterations that extend lifespan, mRNA-binding proteins (RBPs) coordinately regulate di- verse cytoprotective genes by affecting their translation efficiency. To identify RBPs involved in regulation of these processes, we will apply RNA-Seq and ribosome profiling combined with next-generation sequencing and characterize transcriptional and translational changes in a panel of long-lived gene deletion mutants identi- fied in genome-wide screens. We propose to integrate translational profiling data obtained for long-lived mu- tants with information about structural and sequence elements recognized by RBPs and build a regulatory in- teraction network. We also propose to carry out ribosome profiling in replicatively aged wild-type cells and long-lived mutant strains to globally identify genes whose expression is affected by translational regulation dur- ing aging. Finally, we will utilize cutting-edge microfluidic technologies to validate and extend these discover- ies at the single-cell level. Comparing translational profiles in young and replicatively aged wild-type yeast and multiple long-lived deletion mutants will reveal genetic signatures associated with increased longevity and will allow us to identify novel RBPs involved in translational regulation during aging. We will then characterize RBPs and directly identify their mRNA-binding targets using CLIP-Seq. These data will allow us to uncover specific mechanisms and identify cis-regulatory elements that are responsible for translational changes ob- served in long-lived mutants. We will also use fluorescence microscopy and microfluidic cell trapping in order to monitor how the abundance of RBPs changes with age in individual mother cells. Finally, we will test if the candidate RBPs identified from CLIP-Seq and microfluidics experiments play a causal role in mediating the lifespan extension through genetic epistasis analysis in order to determine whether candidate RBPs are nec- essary and sufficient for lifespan extension. Successful completion of this study will add valuable insight into translational regulation of aging, and may provide a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms that regulate aging in humans."
"9345109","The past five years have seen extraordinary advances in genome engineering technologies, yet we still lack efficient, robust tools for precise genome manipulation, particularly the ability to insert a desired sequence at a target site. Such tools would revolutionize our approach to treating human diseases and significantly increase the pace of functional genetic studies throughout the biological sciences. Current approaches are focused on the development of nucleases, such as TALENs, zinc-fingers, and Cas proteins, but there is a limit to the utility of these enzymes and they all rely on the host endogenous DNA repair machinery. Moreover, the use of a nuclease to achieve therapeutic gene editing requires additional efforts to safeguard against off-target mutagenic events. A partial solution to this challenge already exists in the form of mobile genetic elements (MGEs), systems that microbes have been using (or fighting) for millennia to achieve precise genome manipulation. We will explore the diverse pool of MGEs and identify those with characteristics that can be leveraged for eukaryotic genome editing. Precision genome manipulation can be broadly divided into three subcategories: insertions, deletions, and rearrangements, each of which forms the foundation for an array of applications. Our approach will be to consider each of these modes of operation separately to first select candidate MGEs or components of these systems through bioinformatics analysis and extrapolating from known systems. For example, transposases and recombinases may be harnessed for insertions, whereas the RNA-templated genome unscrambling that occurs in the ciliates may be suitable for adaptation for genome rearrangements. Once candidates for these three modes have been identified, we will functionally characterize them in vitro and then develop them for genome editing. Finally, we will assess the specificity, efficacy, and safety of these novel precision genome editors in vivo. This approach represents an innovative new direction in the development of genome engineering technology that overcomes the reliance on nucleases by designing new, self-contained enzymatic tools that can accomplish all three operational modes of genome manipulation. This work will complement our on-going research efforts to develop effective delivery methods for genome engineering components. Together, these technologies will allow us to realize the full potential of genome engineering, particularly as an avenue for treatment of human diseases."
"9468284","Abstract: Current evidence suggests that Mexican-American adolescents living on the U.S.-Mexico border experience higher rates of substance use-related problems compared to non-border Mexican-Americans and their non- Hispanic white counterparts. Because environmental factors are central to the experimentation with and initiation of substance use among adolescents , the unique environmental context of the U.S. Mexico border might exacerbate the risk of substance use for adolescents residing there. However, despite the socioeconomic and environmental risk factors that should increase substance use among these adolescents, the sociocultural characteristics of the border region might be protective against substance use among adolescents. The examination of environmental factors that increase the risk of, or protect against, substance use among border adolescents, as well as their patterns of substance use, is unprecedented, leaving a critical gap in the literature on adolescent substance use at the U.S.-Mexico border. This lack of data, coupled with the evidence to suggest that the border region is exceptionally unique due to its socioeconomic and sociocultural characteristics, warrants the need for substance use research that engages the adolescents that exist and interact in this environment. Ms. Valdez has extensive training in health behavior and adolescent substance use, and has lived experience within/of the unique context of the border region, which makes her well-versed in the study of sociocultural and socioeconomic risk factors and how they relate to specific risk behavior among adolescents. However, she requires additional training to extend her instrument design and testing skills, and her advanced quantitative analysis skills. This predoctoral fellowship will help Ms. Valdez to (1) develop/adapt a culturally- and regionally-responsive survey, (2) assess the reliability and validity of the measure, and (3) refine her quantitative data collection and analysis skills. With mentorship from Dr. Scott Carvajal and a panel of experts, Ms. Valdez and a local youth health coalition will engage in a Youth Participatory Action Research (YPAR) project in the border community of Douglas, AZ, to develop a mixed methods study to examine the environmental factors that influence substance use among border adolescents. Using YPAR methods, the research team will use the Photovoice process to examine the perceived environmental factors that increase risk of, or protect against, substance use among adolescents living at the border. Themes that are elicited and identified from the Photovoice Process will inform the development and delivery of the Border Adolescent Substance Use Survey (BASUS) to assess environmental factors that influence patterns of adolescent substance use at the border. This research is critical to our understanding of adolescent substance use at the U.S.-Mexico border and its rich, YPAR-informed data will help advance the field of prevention. The training plan and research strategy in this application will give Ms. Valdez the time, resources, and mentorship that she needs to succeed as an independent researcher and allow her to make significant contributions to the field."
"9551737","Summary  The master mammalian circadian clock, located in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) maintains the proper phase relationship between circadian clocks located in tissues throughout the body and entrains the circadian system to the environment. The SCN is composed of individual neuronal oscillators linked by intercellular communication into a neural network that generates a robust and precise rhythm. The long-term goal of our research is to understand the intercellular signaling mechanisms that couple SCN neurons into a neural network that generates circadian rhythms. GABA is the most abundant neurotransmitter in the SCN, where it regulates light-induced phase shifts, synchronization of the dorsal and ventral SCN, synchronization of the circadian phase of individual SCN neurons, and the sensitivity of the circadian clock to light-entraining signals. The strength and functional consequences of GABA(A) receptor activation (whether inhibitory or excitatory) are dynamically regulated by the circadian clock. GABA activates postsynaptic GABA(A) receptors located at structurally specialized synapses, which mediates fast interneuronal communication and extrasynaptic receptors which mediate a tonic GABA current. However, it remains unknown how these two GABA currents regulate the activity and synchrony of the SCN neural network. We hypothesize that two membrane transporter families play critical roles in the regulation of the circadian activity of GABA neurotransmission in the SCN. The GABA transporters GAT-1 and GAT-3 regulate the amount and duration of neurotransmitter GABA in the synaptic cleft and extrasynaptic space. We recently demonstrated that in the SCN the GATs are only expressed in astrocytes suggesting that astrocytes play a vital role in regulating the physiological actions of GABA in the SCN network. The chloride cotransporters of the sodium-potassium- chloride (NKCC) and potassium-chloride (KCC) families control the intracellular Cl- concentration and the polarity and magnitude of the GABA(A) receptor-mediated current. In the adult SCN, GABA may serve as both an inhibitory and excitatory neurotransmitter. We propose that the circadian clock uses WNK/SPAK kinases and Ca2+- and cyclic AMP-activated kinases to regulate the activity of the Cl- cotransporters. The goal of this application is to understand better the regulation of GABAergic signaling and how GABA-mediated signaling contributes to the generation of circadian timing signals in the suprachiasmatic nucleus. To accomplish this goal, we will use single cell electrophysiological and imaging techniques together with transgenic mouse models to study GABAergic neurotransmission identified populations of SCN neurons and examine the roles that synaptic and tonic GABAergic neurotransmission and astrocytes play in synchronizing the circadian clocks of individual SCN neurons. We will also kinase signaling pathways in the circadian control of the polarity of GABA(A) receptor-mediated neurotransmission in the SCN and determine the role of the NKCC and KCC families of chloride cotransporters in regulating the synchronization of SCN neuronal oscillators."
"9278038","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Core B ? Data Management, Acquisition, and Resource Sharing The nexus of research proposed in this program project draws on a wide and complex array of data sources. The goal of the data core is to build, manage securely, and facilitate access to a myriad of both traditional and innovative data resources that enable cutting-edge scientific research on health and aging. With the increasing use of complex and restricted-access databases, administrative records from government agencies, data from health care providers and insurers, employer data, linked data, and new data collections, it is imperative that our data are managed professionally. Issues of data security, adherence to data use protocols, and protection of confidentiality in the data are critical aspects of the research environment in which we work. Beyond routine data management responsibilities, the core has the goal of creating a rich data infrastructure for health-related research that takes full advantage of new data opportunities in the evolving landscape of health, health care, and health policy. The data core will serve the research investigators and activities that comprise the program project grant, but it also anchors the data support systems for the NBER's health and aging programs more broadly. A number of specialized tasks are planned for the continuation grant. First, the core will continue to maintain, update, enhance, and promote the use of a Medicare claims database with health and health care information for over 100 million Medicare beneficiaries over the past 30 years. Second, the core will develop as a research resource medical claims data covering populations beyond our Medicare data, taking advantage of the diversity of health plan provisions, state-specific programs, accountable care organizations, Medicaid policies, and other policy and payment variations system-wide. Third, the core will enhance as a research resource the SEER cancer registry data, including the construction of more sophisticated analytic variables on patient diagnoses. Fourth, the core will compile and manage new analytic resources based on hospital and other provider records. The core will also continue in its role of facilitating researcher access to data resources, overseeing and enforcing all data security and restricted use protocols associated with sensitive and proprietary data, and seeking out and developing new data resources useful for health and aging research."
"9520875","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The use of antipsychotic and other psychotropic medications to address behavior and mood among older adults residing in long-term care settings has become a national concern. In 2011, 24% of nursing home residents received antipsychotic medications, despite strong black box warnings issued by the federal Food and Drug Administration of their risk of life-threatening adverse effects, as well as the availability f effective non-pharmacological alternatives. In response, in 2012 the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services launched a national initiative that to date has reduced antipsychotic use in nursing homes by 17 percent. Emerging evidence suggests grave cause for concern in assisted living residences (ALRs) as well, which provide care for almost 750,000 older adults. Seventy percent of assisted living residents have cognitive impairment, 38% have behavioral symptoms, and 25% have symptoms of depression. New data indicate that 69% of ALRs regularly administer medication to control behavior, and 57% of residents with behavioral symptoms are prescribed a medication - including 42% who have no cognitive impairment and 46% who have only mild cognitive impairment. Further, unlicensed staff administer medications in more than 20% of ALRs, and these same individuals determine when an as needed (pro re nata; PRN) medication should be administered. It is no surprise, then, that concern about antipsychotic prescribing in assisted living has become a focus of attention for numerous organizations. Despite notable concern and national attention, there is insufficient information about the actual use of antipsychotic and other psychotropic drugs in ALRs, and virtually no information regarding the settings in which they are most likely to be used and the feasibility of implementing evidence-based alternatives to care. Consequently, it is not possible to develop policies and benchmarks to promote better care as is now occurring in nursing homes. In response, this project, conducted by clinical and health services experts in assisted living research - with close involvement of an advisory board composed of national and state leaders in ALR policy, regulation, practice, education, and advocacy - will obtain and disseminate information to help stakeholders understand the scope of the problem and promote change. Specifically, in a stratified random sample of 280 ALRs across seven states in two regions of the country noted to have the highest and lowest prescribing rates, the proposed study will ascertain (1) the scope and patterns of antipsychotic and other psychotropic medication use; (2) organizational and person-level characteristics related to medication use and potentially inappropriate prescribing; and (3) alternate strategies in use or feasible to address resident distress. It also will (4) disseminate the results to practice, policy, and advocacy stakeholders. t is hypothesized that antipsychotic and other psychotropic medication use, as well as the capacity to implement evidence-based, non-pharmacological practices, will relate to modifiable organizational characteristics that have implications for policy and practice."
"9572650","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Next generation sequencing is gradually changing the face of human genetic studies. Instead of being largely confined to the analysis of common SNPs shared across many populations and amenable to microarray genotyping, genome-wide studies can now examine a wider range of genetic variants - including more diverse types of variation (such as insertion-deletion polymorphisms), variants specific to particular samples or populations, and rare and low frequency variants. Here, we request continued support for our genetic analysis of aging related traits - with a focus on cardiovascular risk factors - in the isolated population from the island of Sardinia, Italy. Over the next several years, we will use next-generation sequencing technology and high-throughput genotyping to study the relationship between rare genetic variation and key cardiovascular risk factors in a family sample containing ~6,000 individuals (and >30,000 close relative pairs) recruited in the Lanusei valley. As part of our planned experiments, we will evaluate problems related to the selection of samples for sequencing, the design of sequencing experiments and protocols, the analysis and curation of the resulting sequence data, and - finally - association analyses that connect the resulting variants to relevant biomedical traits. Individuals being studies are part of a longitudial study of aging and have been characterized for cardiovascular traits and outcomes, including multiple measurements of key traits such as blood lipid levels and blood pressure. We have previously studied this sample to identify common genetic variants that are associated with these cardiovascular traits and that also contribute to the risk of heart disease and obesity. Our proposed experimental plan presents a unique opportunity to evaluate the role of rare variation in this unique sample. We expect that these studies will result in experimental strategies and analysis tools that will be readily deployable by many laboratories to study the genomes of many other individuals and further our understanding of the genetics and biology of many different traits and conditions."
"9453426","Project Summary/Abstract My scientific training includes protein biochemistry during my doctorate and post-doctoral training in neuroscience. My long-term career goal is to become an independent investigator focusing on mechanisms of neurologic diseases related to the AAA+ ATPase Thorase. My goal over the next three years is to acquire additional knowledge and expertise in structural biology in order to elucidate how Thorase is structured and organized in oligomeric complexes to interact with ?-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4- isoxazolepropionic acid receptors (AMPARs). With the help of a team of outstanding mentors, we have developed a structured training program that includes extensive hands-on research training in protein crystallization, negative staining, and single particle cryo-electron microscopy, as well as taking formal courses, presenting at seminars, attending scientific meetings, and training in grant writing. This training program will help me achieve the goals proposed in this K01 and ultimately prepare me to be in a position to compete for R01 funding. Thorase plays a critical role in controlling synaptic plasticity, learning, and memory by modulating the expression of surface AMPARs. Mutations in Thorase have been associated with schizophrenia and in some cases, neonates expressing loss-of-function Thorase demonstrate extreme hypertonia, encephalopathy, seizures, and early death. Mice with Thorase mutations have defects in glutamatergic signaling and deficits in behavior. The abnormalities linked to defects in Thorase function can be normalized by the AMPAR antagonist, perampanel, both in patients and mice. These findings suggest that Thorase could be an important mediator of neurologic diseases, such as schizophrenia, that are linked to compromised AMPAR-mediated glutamatergic neurotransmission. How Thorase modulates AMPAR- mediated glutamatergic neurotransmission remains to be elucidated. AAA+ ATPases are known to form oligomeric complexes that are critical for their functions. The structure of Thorase and the exact number of protomers present in its oligomeric complex are currently unknown. To probe these questions, my mentors and I have designed a series of studies that will provide vital information underlying the mechanism of Thorase-mediated AMPAR trafficking/recycling, as well as other Thorase functions in neurons. To attain these goals, the research aims of the proposal are to (i) determine the different oligomeric states of Thorase using single particle cryo-EM; (ii) identify specific residues of Thorase that are critical for AMPAR trafficking; (iii) determine the crystal structure of Thorase bound to the C-terminus of the AMPAR subunit GluA2 using x-ray crystallography; and (iv) identify new interacting protein partners of Thorase oligomeric complexes. Knowing the structure of Thorase and how its oligomeric complex interacts with AMPARs will advance our understanding of how Thorase mediates changes in synaptic plasticity via AMPAR signaling. This study may also identify new potential therapeutic targets for Thorase and AMPAR-mediated neurologic disease."
"9457283","Bioluminescence assays and imaging methods have been widely adopted for drug discovery because of their simplicity, robustness, and low-cost. The inherently low background and lack of need for excitation light makes bioluminescence superior to fluorescence methods for many applications. Nevertheless, bioluminescence has yet to reach its full potential. We propose the following specific aims: 1) Expand the scope of bioluminescence imaging with synthetic luciferins; 2) Develop bright and functionally orthogonal luciferases suitable for in vivo imaging; and 3) Leverage ?portable reporters? for imaging in any animal. We will exploit the properties of synthetic luciferin analogs to enhance the imaging of invasive brain tumors, viral infection of the CNS, and circadian rhythms. We will develop fully orthogonal luciferin-luciferase pairs that can serve as internal controls and enable multiplexed imaging. Finally, we will overcome the restricted set of available luciferase-expressing animals by developing bioluminescent reporters that can be introduced into any animal of interest."

"9485173","ABSTRACT Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a common form of dementia, but little data exist on the risk and prevalence of AD among American Indians and Alaska Natives (AI/ANs). Precision medicine (PM) has potential for detecting and treating diseases such as AD. PM combines data on clinical, genomic, biomarker, and environmental factors with data on health behaviors to assess individual risk of a given disease. It can maximize the effectiveness of tailored clinical management. However, no research has addressed AI/AN preferences for communicating educational or recruitment information for AD or PM studies. AI/ANs experience communication barriers to research participation, as well as prefer visual aids that assist comprehension and communication that align with Native traditions. In 2015, President Obama announced a $215 million PM initiative which emphasizes adequate representation of racial and ethnic minorities. In 2016, NIH funded 8 healthcare organizations to assemble a cohort of 1 million people who will contribute blood and urine samples along with health, environmental, and lifestyle data to a population-based repository for PM research (the All of Us Research Program). We will collaborate with one grantee ? the University of Arizona/Banner Health ? that will enroll 10,000 AI/ANs -- to evaluate methods to recruit AI/ANs at their Phoenix-Tucson clinical facilities. AI/AN informants will help create culturally appropriate recruitment materials (brochures, digital stories) for AD and PM research. Finally, we will conduct a pragmatic randomized controlled trial with 4,000 AI/ANs enrollees in the All of Us cohort. Participants will receive either a standard educational brochure on AD and PM and the importance of research (control) or a culturally tailored, graphics-rich brochure with identical information, and view a digital story featuring personal narratives of AI/ANs on AD (intervention). Participants will then be invited to complete an optional AD-PM Module to assesses AD knowledge and attitudes, health literacy, ethnic identify, and cognition. Upon completion, they will join other AI/ANs who are interested in future AD and PM research, and link their All of Us data and biospecimens to their AD-PM Module data. Our 2 primary outcomes will be completion of the AD-PM Module and enrollment in the AD-PM Cohort. The Specific Aims are to: 1) to evaluate recruitment strategies for AI/ANs in the UAZB program, and address factors that might affect implementation of our trial; 2) create culturally tailored materials on AD and PM, and evaluate their clarity and acceptability; 3) conduct a randomized controlled trial to test the effect of these materials on completion of the AD-PM Module and enrollment in the AD-PM Cohort; and 4) identify patient-level predictors of AD-PM Cohort enrollment, and evaluate potential differences in the effectiveness of recruitment approach by age, sex, education, cultural identity, and rurality. The AD-PM Cohort will represent a unique resource for alleviating the stark underrepresentation of AI/ANs in AD and PM research. Results will highlight communication strategies that facilitate or hinder AI/AN recruitment, elucidate knowledge gaps regarding AD and PM."
"9443894","Antibiotics and opioids are the top therapeutic categories prescribed by Dentists. Interestingly, factors associ- ated with prescribing behaviors of these medication classes are similar. Our preliminary data on dental pre- scribing demonstrates that high prescribers of opioids are also high prescribers of antibiotics. However, there is a current knowledge gap in our understanding of medication prescribing and overprescribing (for inappro- priate indications and/or excessive quantity/potency/duration) by Dentists. This gap is significant because Dentists prescribe 1 out of every 10 prescriptions (Rx) for both antibiotics and opioids in the US. Inappro- priate and appropriate use of antibiotic and opioids are a risk to patient safety, including: bacterial resistance, Clostridium difficile infection, opioid overdose, drug dependence and diversion. Opioid overprescribing is con- cerning because substance users commonly seek opioids from dentists, dentists infrequently use prescription drug monitoring programs (PDMP) and fatalities secondary to opioid use have been linked to dental prescrib- ing. Use of antibiotics for infection prophylaxis prior to dental procedures has been associated with C. difficile. Guidelines for infective endocarditis and prosthetic joint infection prophylaxis during dental procedures were recently updated, significantly reducing the number of patients requiring antibiotic prophylaxis. However, de- spite infection prophylaxis being the primary indication for antibiotics prescribed by dentists, our preliminary data shows only a small (0.7%) decrease in overall dental antibiotic prescribing. Although efforts are increas- ing to curtail inappropriate use of these medication classes, most interventions are focused on physicians and midlevel providers (nurse practitioners, physician assistants). Guided by preliminary data, we will be pursuing [2] specific aims: 1) [Assess] dental prescribing of antibiotics and opioid medications and identify patient and prescriber characteristics associated with high rates of overprescribing and 2) [Compare attitudes to- wards prescribing antibiotics and opioids for dentist with practices located in high and low prescribing com- munities across the United States.] The proposed study is aligned with the research priority areas of AHRQ (safer health care; improvements in health care practice, especially in ambulatory care) and 2 White House National Action Plans focused on antibiotic resistance and adverse drug events associated with opioid use. We propose to conduct a mixed-methods study to assess antibiotic and opioid dental prescribing based on American Dental Association treatment recommendations and identify factors related to prescribing. The ex- pected outcomes of this study include providing baseline data on the extent of antibiotic and opioid overpre- scribing by dentists, identification of barriers and facilitators to improving prescribing of antibiotics and opioids and selection of a pilot implementation project to improve the quality of dental care. Our long-term goal is to improve patient dental care by implementing interventions that will increase prudent antimicrobial use, de- crease opioid overprescribing and decrease serious adverse events."
"9352286","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): As chronic illnesses progress over time, patients experience clinical status changes that require care transitions across health care settings or to new phases of care. All transitions present opportunities for high quality patient-centered care; however, in practice many care transitions are poorly managed and many decisions do not respect patient values or take available evidence into account. This application proposes to develop a center for patient-centered outcomes research (PCOR) at the University of Missouri (MU) with a thematic focus on improving patient care transitions across health care settings or from one phase of care to another. To build long-term sustainability for conducting patient-centered outcomes research the MU Center will: (1) develop MU's capabilities in PCOR by mentoring investigators, supporting pilot studies, providing research training, and new hiring; (2) foster development of skills and capabilities to work with large data sets using advanced analytic methods to study comparative treatment effectiveness; (3) build research expertise on practice-changing interventions to support care transitions; and (4) engage stakeholders through focus groups, a patient advisory panel, and a novel social networking and tailored messaging platform that facilitates information gathering, feedback from participants to investigators, and dissemination. The MU Center will also develop digital infrastructure to support data collection and analysis, test novel research designs, and facilitate building a regional vascular surgery registry. The three associated projects will include patients with ischemic limbs undergoing an inpatient procedure, patients transitioning from skilled nursing facilities to the community, and patients receiving or being considered for opioid therapy for chronic pain in primary care practices in the American Academy of Family Physicians National Research Network. They will enhance the Center's expertise in using large data sets and developing strategies for practice change while engaging stakeholders both to improve the research and to facilitate its dissemination and implementation. The MU Center will be supported by strong internal and external advisors, and the application proposes a robust evaluation process."
"9566583","Project Summary / Abstract Stem/progenitor cell transplantation-based replacement of astrocytes is a novel and potentially powerful therapeutic strategy for treating CNS diseases such as traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI). Towards this goal, we propose to test transplantation of human induced Pluripotent Stem (iPS) cell-derived astrocytes (hiPSAs) for mitigating SCI-induced neuropathic pain. A major portion of SCI patients suffer from neuropathic pain, resulting in often long-term physical and psychological burdens. Effective treatments for this debilitating outcome of SCI are currently lacking; therefore, novel and robust therapeutic approaches are urgently needed.  Following SCI, chronic dysregulation of extracellular glutamate homeostasis plays a key role in persistent central hyperexcitability of superficial dorsal horn (DH) neurons that mediate pain neurotransmission, leading to neuropathic pain. Astrocytes are the principal cell type that expresses the glutamate transporter, GLT1, which is responsible for the vast majority of glutamate uptake in the intact CNS, particularly in spinal cord. In our rodent model of cervical contusion SCI that results in persistent neuropathic pain, we find significant and long-lasting reductions in GLT1 expression and functional GLT1-mediated glutamate uptake in cervical DH.  iPS cells are a novel and clinically-relevant source for homogeneous derivation of mature cell types in large quantities for applications such as transplantation, potentially in an autologous fashion from the eventual patient recipient. The use of iPS cell transplantation to deliver astrocytes represents an exciting strategy that has not been extensively studied to date, particularly with respect both to targeting key astrocyte functions such as glutamate uptake at a mechanistic level and to addressing neuropathic pain.  Importantly, a majority of human spinal cord trauma cases affect cervical regions and are of the contusion/compression type, urgently calling for the assessment of disease etiology and treatment of neuropathic pain specifically in models of cervical contusion SCI to provide relevance to the patient population.  In Aim 1a, we will determine whether hiPSA transplantation can reverse several forms of established neuropathic pain-related behavior in a rat model of cervical contusion. Importantly, we will assess motivational and affective components of pain using an operant paradigm. In Aim 1b, we will determine whether hiPSAs can reduce hyperexcitability of DH pain neurons using whole-cell patch clamp recording in an intact ex vivo preparation. In Aim 2a, we will examine the ability of hiPSA transplants to express GLT1 and to restore GLT1- mediated glutamate uptake levels in DH after cervical contusion. We will also engineer hiPSAs to overexpress GLT1 to enhance their therapeutic potential. In Aim 2b, we will examine whether hiPSAs can alter the DH microglia/macrophage response that plays a central role in hyperexcitability and chronic pain. We will assess whether hiPSAs can shift this response after SCI away from a M1 pro-inflammatory phenotype (and toward a M2 reparative phenotype) as an additional - and potentially powerful - mechanism of hiPSA transplant action."
"9222295","PROJECT SUMMARY The mission of our VA Rehabilitation Research and Development Center for Limb Loss Prevention and Prosthetic Engineering is to improve the quality of life and functional status of veterans who are at risk for, or have undergone, a lower extremity amputation. The Center brings together investigative teams that identify clinical problems, model them into hypothesis-driven research, conduct experiments, and make evidence- based conclusions before disseminating the results to veteran, clinical, and scientific audiences. Our Center includes three major cores: (1) Limb Loss Prevention, (2) Prosthetic Engineering, and (3) Rehabilitation Outcomes. The Limb Loss Prevention core aims to reduce functional and anatomical limb loss by studying the disease processes that lead to aberrant limb function and by developing novel, state-of-the-art technologies for studying the foot. Highly specialized techniques, such as biplane fluoroscopy, cadaveric gait simulation, gated MRI loading, and computational modeling, will be employed to quantify the effects of foot deformity, ankle arthritis and diabetes, and to compare the effect of different treatment options. The Prosthetic Engineering core aims are to enhance mobility, reduce the risk of injury, and improve the comfort of veteran amputees. We address these needs by designing and evaluating novel state-of-the-art prostheses that leverage advances in robotics, computation, and instrumentation. The Rehabilitation Outcomes core integrates the complex multi-dimensional issues of medical co-morbidity, psychological status, and social factors and their impact on amputee functional outcome. The development and evaluation of group-based therapeutic interventions, and the improvement of the amputation level decision making process are the foci of this core. Since our last Center renewal in 2012, we have been awarded $5.4M in intramural funding via 15 VA RR&D grants and $3.3M in extramural funding via 6 non-VA federal grants. During the same fiscal period (2013- 2015), the Center has published 69 peer-reviewed articles, 5 book chapters, 3 conference papers, 67 conference abstracts, and our investigators have given 108 presentations and invited lectures. We have also expanded our research capabilities through many successful collaborations with multiple departments at the University of Washington, other top-tier research Universities, leading research institutions, VAPSHCS Health Services, and ERIC (Epidemiology Research an Informatics Center) investigators, as well as clinician/scientists at other VA Medical Centers. Our current 6,300 square feet of laboratory and office space will nearly double, and be transformed into state-of-the-art research facilities when we transition into the new Mental Health and Research Building in 2017. Our Center includes a group of highly productive and recognized senior investigators including two who have won the prestigious Paul B. Magnuson Award for Rehabilitation Research and two recipients of VA Research Career Scientist awards. We have also recruited three early-career PhD researchers and two Career Development Award winners who bring important skillsets to further advance the Center mission. Our Center investigative team includes clinician/scientists with expertise in Orthopaedics, Rehabilitation Medicine, and Rehabilitation Psychology. This strong clinical linkage ensures that our research is relevant to the veteran patients who are the focus of our work. We have developed an impressive training program to create a new generation of scientists who will contribute to veteran care including: undergraduate, graduate and medical students, post-doctoral fellows, interns/residents, and clinical fellows. Our Center?s work is further enhanced by a skilled research team including: MS engineers, research assistants, a biostatistician, and a prosthetist. In summary, this Center has developed a remarkable infrastructure that has enabled it to conduct both high quality, and highly prolific research that is responsive to the emerging needs of our veterans."
"9435991","MS damages white matter pathways that connect brain regions, i.e. the structural connectome (SC), disrupting flow of electrical signals, i.e. the functional connectome (FC), causing cognitive and physical disability. Howev- er, the burden of disease in the brain is not always proportional to an individual's disability. How the brain com- pensates for damage in resilient patients remains a mystery, making it difficult to develop accurate prognoses and treatments that can leverage this process in less fortunate patients. Without this knowledge it will not be possible to create individualized therapies based on the brain's natural resiliency mechanism or to establish reliable ways to predict potential for recovery. The thriving field of brain connectivity network analysis, or con- nectomics, provides a promising tool with which to capture, model and understand mechanisms of resiliency. The long-term goal is to develop novel, personalized rehabilitation methods that mimic and enhance the brain's resiliency process to restore cognitive and physical abilities after damage due to neurological conditions. The overall objective of this work is to identify connectome-based imaging biomarkers of resiliency in MS, i.e. those that separate patients with high disease burden and low disability (high-adapters) from those with similar dis- ease burden and high disability (low-adapters). Our central hypothesis, the functional rerouting hypothesis, states that resilient patients' brains recover from injury by restoring normal functional connections using alter- nate white matter pathways to circumvent irrevocably damaged structural connections. This hypothesis is based on published and preliminary work in simulated studies, severe brain injury and mild to moderate trau- matic brain injury. The rationale for the proposed research is that insight into the brain's ability to compensate for injury would allow for more accurate prognostication and enable the development of novel therapeutic strategies for MS. Guided by strong preliminary data, this hypothesis will be tested by pursuing two specific aims: to identify global and regional metrics of the 1) structural and functional connectomes and 2) structure- function relationship between the connectomes that differentiate high-adapting and low-adapting MS patients. We will collect functional, diffusion and anatomical MRIs from 25 controls and 42 high- and 42 low-adapting MS patients to extract structural and functional connectomes and test central hypotheses. The approach is in- novative, in the applicant's opinion, as it implements cutting-edge machine learning techniques and a novel mathematical model to formalize the relationship between structural and functional connectomes and capture network-level functional rerouting in resiliency to MS-related damage. The proposed research is significant in that it is expected to have broad translational impact on the development of more accurate prognoses as well as targeted, personalized treatments for patients with MS and other neurological disorders. Ultimately, such knowledge has the potential to open up new horizons for innovative therapies, e.g. through non-invasive brain stimulation, that can dramatically improve the quality of life for patients with debilitating neurological disease."
"9423503","PROJECT SUMMARY A significant number of patients Alzheimer's disease or related dementia diagnoses will be cared for in nursing homes near the end of life. Unfortunately, many of these patients experience unwanted and burdensome medical treatments, such as potentially avoidable hospitalizations, that negatively impact quality of life. Advance care planning (ACP) discussions with patients and family caregivers are important to explore goals in advance of a crisis and support informed, values-based decision-making. The ACP process helps ensure that preferences about treatments such as hospitalization are known, documented, and honored. Research indicates that ACP can reduce burdensome treatments and increase the likelihood that care will match documented preferences. Nursing homes are currently required by regulations to offer ACP to patients and families. However, there are no training requirements for nursing home staff and approaches to fulfilling this regulatory and ethical responsibility vary widely, resulting in inconsistent ACP. The ?Aligning Patient Preferences ? a Role Offering Alzheimer's patients, Caregivers, and Healthcare providers Education and Support (APPROACHES)? trial will test the ACP Specialist Program. Existing nursing home staff members will be trained to enhance care and reduce unwanted, burdensome hospitalizations through improved ACP procedures, standardized staff education on ACP, and systematic ACP facilitation. The primary trial outcome is hospital transfers (admissions and emergency department visits) per 1000 person-days alive. Consistent with the spirit of a pragmatic trial, study outcomes rely on data already collected for quality improvement, clinical or billing purposes. In the 18 month R21 pilot phase, the aims are to: 1) Establish the trial's organizational structure and processes; and 2) Pilot test the intervention in 4 nursing homes. In the R33 phase, a pragmatic cluster randomized clinical trial will be conducted in partnership with 3 nursing home corporations who operate a combined total of 206 diverse urban and rural facilities in 14 states. The aims of the 42 month R33 phase are to: 3) Evaluate the primary outcome of hospital transfers over 12 months among patients with dementia in intervention versus control nursing homes; and 4) Compare ACP documentation, measures of quality of care at the end of life, and patient and family satisfaction between the intervention versus control nursing homes. If successful, the ACP Specialist Program will be primed for rapid translation into nursing home practice to reduce unwanted, burdensome hospitalizations and improve quality of care for patients with dementia."
"9466175","Prostate cancer (PCa) is the second leading cause of cancer death in American men, with 26,130 deaths and 161,360 new cases estimated in the US in 2017. Radiation therapy is one of the standard therapies for high and intermediate risk patients, and is a non-surgical therapy option for low risk patients. A combined chemo-radiation therapy (CRT) approach has been shown in several trials to improve survival in multiple cancers, compared with monotherapies. However, systemic chemotherapy accompanying CRT typically come at the price of increased toxicity and thus require synchronization of the two modalities to achieve maximum benefit. Here, an immediate need exists to deliver the drug specifically at tumor site in locally recurrent patients while avoiding toxicities associated with systemic delivery and resulting in preferential radiosensitization of the prostate compared to the normal structures. Northeastern University and Theranano LLC in collaboration with clinicians at Brigham and Womens Hospital and Dana Farber Cancer Institute have developed an innovative combinatorial treatment strategy of Local Chemo-Radiation Therapy (LCRT) using a modified brachytherapy spacer platform in the form of a INCeRT (ImplaNts for ChemoRadiation Therapy) spacer loaded with Docetaxel (DTX) to locally radiosensitize the prostate, enabling a synergistic cure with the use of lower radiation doses, thereby leading to less rectal radiation toxicity and minimal chemotherapeutic systemic side effects. These new INCeRT spacers are physically similar to the inert spacers routinely used in prostate brachytherapy but now loaded with formulations of DTX which can be tuned to release the drug payload from a week to several months. The technology has been exclusively licensed to TheraNano LLC for commercialization and translation to the clinic. The phase 1 project goals will be achieved through the following specific aims: Specific Aim 1: Development, scale up and quality control of docetaxel loaded INCeRT brachytherapy spacers. Develop INCeRT brachytherapy spacers loaded with DTX with analysis of quality control, reproducibility, drug loading and drug release using optimized SOPs. Earlier work at Northeastern University has produced INCeRT spacers in batches of <20. Here, we plan to scale-up the process to routinely manufacture DTX INCeRT spacers in batches of several 100s in GLP conditions. The study design will include setting up a pilot plant for fabrication, characterization of INCeRT spacers loaded with docetaxel and quality control assessment in terms of reproducibility, size, drug loading and release kinetics under GLP conditions. Specific Aim 2: In vivo therapeutic efficacy of combined Chemo-Radiation treatment and toxicity assessment in Prostate cancer models. We will evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of INCeRT spacers combined with Brachytherapy/EBRT by locally implanting the spacers at the tumor site in PCa animal models. We will also assess gross immunotoxicity associated with the combined treatment."
"9401865","ABSTRACT Primates, including humans, are expert at coordinating their two arms together with their gaze to facilitate skilled behavior. Our overall goal is to understand the neural correlates of ?hand-eye-hand? coordination. We view bimanual and eye-hand coordination as flexible behavior that reflects task-specific interactions among neuronal circuits. A classical description of eye-hand coordination is that saccade and reach reaction times are correlated. Yet coordination is much more than just correlated start times, and coordination can take many forms. For example, we can use each of our hands to perform the same action at the same time, the same action at different times, or different actions at similar times. In seeking the neural correlates of coordination, particular circuits and structures in the brain appear to be associated with particular effectors and/or actions. We hypothesize that coordination involves specific modules exchanging information at specific times and, importantly, in a task-specific manner. This proposal will assess inter-areal and inter-hemispheric exchanges of information and gather evidence that they subserve a range of hand-eye-hand coordination challenges. We focus on motor planning in posterior parietal reach region (PRR) and the lateral intraparietal area (LIP), early modules in the visuomotor pathways for reaches and saccades, respectively. Animals will perform simple, natural unimanual and bimanual reaches and saccades while we measure cross-area LFP-LFP and spike-LFP coherence to identify task-speci?c patterns of information ?ow. We also introduce a new method to determine the direction of information transfer, a critical factor in understanding the overall computational picture. By describing hand-eye-hand coordination as a set of behaviors that are flexibly recruited to meet specific task goals, and by characterizing the neural correlates of this recruitment as a shifting network of inter-areal connectivity, this work has the potential to change the way we think about motor coordination."
"9418877","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT In existence for more than 50 years, the Birth Defects Research Laboratory (BDRL) is now the only NIH- funded fetal tissue repository available to scientific recipients in the US. It is therefore a crucial scientific resource to retain for facilitating biomedical research, especially since alternative commercial laboratories are embroiled in controversy related to accusations of trade in fetal tissues. The scientific importance of fetal tissues to scientific research progress and health care is highlighted in a recent high profile Nature news-feature article (PMID 26659164). In fiscal year 2014, NIH funded 164 projects that utilized fetal tissues for a total expenditure of $76 million, with our laboratory as the only NIH fetal tissue repository, being the primary resource for many of these projects. The track record and success of the BDRL has therefore been proven many times over in its consistent provision of a host of scientific recipient-related services with fetal tissues, fully compliant with strict ethical and research guidelines, without misdemeanor. Spectacular technological advances in epigenetics, genomics, cellular and tissue imaging, and developmental biology have greatly expanded research opportunities for utilizing these precious tissues to facilitate current and future biomedical research progress. These advances establish the rationale for the laboratory to innovate and undertake multiple collaborations to both evaluate and demonstrate the utility of novel experimental approaches to maximize the scientific utility of these tissues. This application seeks to develop the resource beyond the core fundamental goal of the resource aka the systematic collection, staging, identification and processing of fetal specimens for distribution of tissues and derivatives to scientific recipients. We, therefore, propose to develop the research resource utility further by engaging with key collaborators to synergistically develop new services and thereby concurrently promote scientific awareness of these approaches to increase recipient recruitment and enhance research progress into the bases of human development and disease."
"9428586","Project Summary Health disparities among sexual and gender minority people exist across the lifespan, and are increasingly well-documented, yet gaps remain in our basic understanding of how health varies within these groups. This was emphasized in the Institute of Medicine's 2011 report on LGBT health, which pointed specifically to the need for more research among bisexual populations. While bisexual men experience notable health disparities related to both outcomes and access to care, we know very little about the unique risk factors that bisexual- identified men experience. The minority stress model posits that minority groups face stressors associated with their minority status that are unique and additive to everyday life stressors. The majority of work related to sexual minority stressors and health has presumed that experiences of lesbian, gay and bisexual groups are the same. Additionally, there is little work assessing the health effects of daily-level, identity-based stressors and health among SGM populations. The proposed study will address these gaps in the literature, using a novel, multi-method approach. Through qualitative interviews, use of daily electronic diaries over 28 consecutive days, and survey measures, we will test the hypothesis that racially diverse bisexual men who more frequently report microaggressions will have poorer mental and physical health outcomes than bisexual men who less frequently report microaggressions. Aims are: 1)Identify the characteristics of racially diverse bisexual men's microaggressive experiences, e.g., context, content and source, including their responses to such experiences; 2) Determine the frequency and source of sexual orientation and racial/ethnic microaggressions among bisexual men and test their association(s) with daily mental and physical health; 3) Assess lifetime stressors that may influence associations between MAs and daily and lifetime mental and physical health. This study is a companion to a similar study among bisexual women, and will allow for cross- gender comparisons. This preliminary exploration of within-group differences can significantly advance our knowledge of the risk factors associated with health disparities among racially diverse bisexual men. Findings will be critical for informing directions for future research and practice through the identification of relevant research questions and/or foci for preventative interventions."
"9470628","Schizopphrenia (SZ) affects 1% of the world population. Allelic variants of the dystrobrevin binding protein 1 (DTNBP1) gene, now a top SZ candidate gene, are associated with fiber tract impairments in healthy people and reduced brain volume in preteens- both SZ symptoms. However, the downstream effects of decreased dysbindin are poorly understood. Dysfunctional dysbindin decreases the copper-transporting P-type ATPase (ATP7A) and the copper transporter CTR1. ATP7A and CTR1 facilitate copper transport between the blood and the brain. The role of copper in SZ has been controversial, with many studies finding increased blood copper in patients. However, these studies have not considered copper may build up in the blood because it cannot get into the brain. Copper-decreasing experimental manipulations produce demyelination, dopamine increases, and SZ-like behavioral impairments. Taken together, dysbindin/copper alterations can result in SZ- like pathology such as impaired white matter integrity, excess dopamine, and altered mitochondrial activity, and yet this combined pathway remains largely unstudied. Overall, I hypothesize copper transport alterations contribute to SZ pathology, potentially through decreased dysbindin expression. I will test this in postmortem SZ brain, first-episode antipsychotic-naïve SZ patients, and a dysbindin knockout mouse model.  Specific Aim 1: I have learned western blotting, and am now learning immunohistochemical analysis.  Specific Aim 2A. We will test the copper state of postmortem substantia nigra and hippocampus, and the relationship of this state to copper transporters ATP7A/CTR1 in both treated and untreated SZ. Furthermore, we will assess the mechanism of action of antipsychotics in relation to these variables.  Specific Aim 2B. To discover potential schizophrenia biomarkers, we will assess peripheral copper state and its relationship to copper transporters and methylation status of DTNBP1, SLC31A1(CTR1), and ATP7A before and after 6 weeks of antipsychotic treatment in first-episode, antipsychotic-naïve SZ patients.  Specific Aim 2C. In dysbindin knockout, heterozygous, and wild-type mice, we will test peripheral, hippocampal, and nigral copper state, and the relation to copper transporters ATP7A/CTR1, cognitive deficits, and the mechanism of antipsychotic mediated changes before and after 28 days quetiapine treatment.  Specific Aim 3: These studies will provide the first evidence of SZ brain copper state, and resolve the juxtaposition between excess copper in SZ blood and the SZ-like symptoms induced by copper deficit. Furthermore, these studies will provide new data about risk gene dysbindin and its effects on copper transporters (a previously unstudied pathway in SZ) and a potential mechanism of antipsychotic rescue of copper starvation deficits, which could yield novel targets for drug development. I will learn quantitative RT- PCR, methylation assay, immunohistochemistry, electron microscopy and tissue sectioning, brain collection, scientific writing, lab and animal management, and all that these skills entail, as well as proficient teaching."
"9445096","! SUMMARY Errors made by the RAG1/RAG2 endonuclease during V(D)J recombination can lead to genome instability and the development of leukemia and lymphoma. One important cause of such instability is improper action of RAG at cryptic recombination signal sequences (RSSs) that are present abundantly in the genome. Our prior work provided mechanistic and structural insights into RAG protein-DNA complexes and revealed that RAG1 and RAG2 bind to numerous sites in the genome outside of the antigen receptor loci, virtually all of which are active promoters or enhancers. We further demonstrated that such off-target RAG binding occurs through two modes, one driven by a histone code reader function of RAG2 (largely at promoters) and the other dependent on regulatory portions of RAG1 (largely at enhancers). The thousands of off-target RAG binding sites and the millions of cryptic RSSs in the genome raise fundamental questions about how the genome is protected from devastating instability caused by RAG. The central objective of our proposed experiments is to determine the rules that govern RAG off-target activity by understanding the interactions that dictate RAG localization in the genome and the mechanisms that determine which cryptic RSSs are cleaved by RAG and which are spared. We will use complementary biochemical, biophysical, genetic, and genomic approaches to achieve the following aims: Aim 1. Determine the rules governing the selection of cryptic RSS targets by RAG. We and others have identified intriguing sequence and topological features of the cryptic RSSs cleaved by RAG, but it is unknown to what extent, or how, these features dictate RAG activity. We will systematically determine how cryptic RSS orientation, location, and sequence influence RAG off-target activity and in the process, test a provocative new hypothesis that RAG acquires its targets in part through linear tracking along DNA. Aim 2. Determine the domains and interactions directing RAG1 to active enhancers. Much off-target cutting by RAG occurs in enhancers, but the molecular interactions that dictate localization of RAG to these regions are not known. We will identify the portions of RAG1 and the RAG1-binding partners that specify enhancer binding and test the hypothesis that RAG1, like RAG2, is a reader of the histone code. Aim 3. Determine how retargeting of RAG alters cRSS selection and off-target cleavage patterns. We will use RAG mutants and a novel, inducible in vivo targeting system to direct RAG to new sites in the genome and determine the spectrum of new cleavage sites that arise. We will also reconstitute RAG- mediated cleavage at strong cryptic RSSs normally ignored by RAG to uncover the epigenetic and chromatin architectural parameters that specify RAG off-target activity.  Together, our proposed studies have a dual significance, both for basic mechanisms of RAG function and for the causes of cancer."
"9402516","The inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), are significant causes of morbidity with recent estimates suggesting there are more than 3 million Americans with IBD with very significant financial burden to the US economy. More than 200 genetic loci that increase susceptibility to IBD have been identified with the anticipation that an understanding of the molecular architecture of IBD will lead to improved outcomes for patients. However, there are significant challenges remaining to achieve this and this proposal seeks to address some of these key issues. 1) The majority of advances have been made in European ancestry populations and we aim to continue our efforts to recruit and study non European populations to extend the benefits of these advances to all parts of society. 2) We will address unmet medical needs by focusing on genetic discovery in two areas: peri anal fistulizing CD is associated with poor quality of life, significant morbidity, and poor response to treatment; and non response to anti TNF therapy which happens in the majority of subjects with IBD. This latter phenotype is increasingly important to define as new therapeutic options become available for treating IBD. 3) Many of the IBD associated loci fall in intergenic ('junk' DNA) regions and their functional consequences remain unclear. Using innovative genomic approaches together with state of the art bioinformatics strategies we propose to identify the processes that are influenced by the susceptibility loci we have identified. 4) And finally we will extend our previous observations that Paneth cell phenotypes are an important readout of gene environment interactions, as well as an important clinical biomarker, in CD to populations from a variety of ethnicities and geographical locations. Collectively, these approaches will shed additional insights into the underlying causes of IBD as well as identify additional biomarkers for use in clinical practice and highlight novel potential therapeutic pathways for IBD."
"9464143","PROJECT SUMMARY Over 36.7 million people worldwide, including 1.2 million people in the USA are HIV positive. HIV-associated sensory neuropathy (HIV-SN) is the most frequent neurological manifestation of HIV and is characterized as a distal symmetrical, predominantly sensory, polyneuropathy. HIV-SN may represent 2 clinically indistinguishable neuropathies with distinct pathogenesis: a distal axonal degeneration caused by interaction of sensory neurons with HIV-associated proteins such as gp120 and Tat and also an anti-retroviral therapy (ART)-induced toxic neuropathy, ART may also potentiate the HIV-SN induced by HIV proteins. Recent studies have implicated mitochondrial dysfunction in the pathogenesis of HIV-SN and disruption of neuronal mitochondrial biogenesis and quality control (biogenesis-mitophagy axis) occurs in HIV-SN patients. There is no current treatment that targets a pathological process underlying HIV-SN, but the emerging appreciation of the role of mitochondrial dysfunction in the underlying pathogenesis provides a potential therapeutic approach. The academic founders of WinSanTor recently reported that neurite outgrowth from peripheral sensory neurons is under a cholinergic constraint mechanism mediated by type 1 muscarinic receptors (M1R). Stimulation of the M1R restrains mitochondrial function, thereby limiting neuronal energy supply and neurite growth. Conversely, inhibition of M1R activates AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) with subsequent enhancement of mitochondrial bioenergetic function and neurite regeneration. M1R inhibition also prevents and reverses indices of distal degenerative neuropathy in animal models of diabetic and chemotherapy-induced neuropathy. These promising findings suggest that the therapeutic efficacy of M1R antagonists has the potential to extend across diverse peripheral neuropathies in which mitochondrial function is compromised. We have recently found that mouse models that overexpress HIV-associated proteins exhibit mitochondrial dysfunction and develop symptoms of neuropathy. Further, reduced neurite outgrowth from sensory neurons exposed to the HIV protein gp120 in vitro was prevented by treatment with the M1R antagonist pirenzepine, while loss of corneal nerves induced by delivery of gp120 to the eye of normal mice was both prevented and reversed by concurrent topical application of a M1R antagonist. Based on these results, the goal of this Phase I STTR project is to 1) evaluate efficacy of pirenzepine against neuropathy in mice expressing HIV-Tat protein; 2) evaluate efficacy of pirenzepine against neuropathy in mice expressing HIV-gp120 protein with concurrent ART therapy. Successful completion of this Phase I project will support further pre-clinical development of pirenzepine as a novel therapeutic for treatment of HIV- SN. In Phase II, we will further define the safety/toxicology profiles of pirenzepine to support filing of an IND application with the FDA."
"9470487","Project Summary Glucocorticoids (GCs) including betamethasone (BM) are routine therapy administered to women at risk of early preterm labor to facilitate fetal lung development and reduce infant mortality rates. However, fetal steroid exposure may lead to negative long term consequences for autonomic regulation. In a sheep model of fetal programming, BM-exposed (BMX) adult offspring exhibit elevated mean arterial pressure (MAP), decreased baroreflex sensitivity (BRS) for control of heart rate and insulin resistance accompanied by dysregulation of the brain, renal and circulating renin-angiotensin system (RAS).In the brain solitary tract nucleus of the dorsal medulla and cerebrospinal fluid from 4th ventricle, a major area of autonomic integration, there is a shift towards the sympathetic activator angiotensin II (Ang II) and actions through the AT1 receptor that oppose the beneficial actions of angiotensin-(1-7) [Ang-(1-7)] at the Mas receptor for BRS regulation in both sexes. The signaling mechanisms and extent of alterations in oxidative stress and/or inflammatory pathway within the brain in animals given BMX has yet to be established. My dissertation has established consequences of fetal exposure to GCs on intracellular signaling within the adult brain medulla at 12 months of age in particular, two key pathways that are prominent in the actions of angiotensins, insulin and leptin: mitogen activated kinase pathway (MAPK) and phosphoinositide 3-kinase pathway (PI3K). My data shows that sex-specific mal-adaptive changes in these two signaling pathways (increased phosphorylated ERK1/2 in males; decreased phosphorylated Akt and GSK-3? in females) within cardiovascular centers of the brain accompanies the improper processing of Ang peptides, which in turn may impact oxidative stress, inflammation and sympathetic outflow. I then tested the hypothesis that replacement of Ang-(1-7) via intracerebroventricular infusion in 4-5 month old BMX sheep, that already shown to prevent the increase in blood pressure and improve baroreflex sensitivity, reverse programming effects on signaling, oxidative stress and inflammation, providing insight into mechanisms of Ang-(1-7) actions. Preliminary data shows that replacement of Ang-(1-7) in male BMX sheep at this early age significantly lowers phosphorylated protein expression of ERK1/2 compared to BMX males given aCSF. There is a trend for an inverse correlation of the BRS and ERK1/2 and a significant inverse correlation of Mas receptor expression and blood pressure. My future studies will provide information on alterations in signaling pathways and their downstream effector mechanisms (reactive oxygen species, nitric oxide and inflammation) resulting from BMX-induced down-regulation of the Ang-(1-7)-Mas receptor axis that may lead to a host of neural dysregulation and disease; indeed, the MAPK and PI3K pathway has been implicated in Alzheimer's disease plaque formation. My future interest is to investigate in the human population the role of RAS and cardiometabolic function on cognitive decline. With a more epidemiological and public health approach I hope to contribute to better understanding of factors related to diseases of aging."
"9349491","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Ambulatory medication error can be a lethal problem in children with chronic conditions; overdoses can be fatal and chronic under-doses (non-adherence) lead to serious injury. One in four children has a chronic condition and one in five takes a daily medication. While it is known that children with chronic conditions take only half of their medications, the amount of non-adherence which is caused by error has not been studied in any population. Ambulatory children are particularly vulnerable to preventable adverse drug events, due to the complexity of medication weight-based dosing, coordination between multiple caregivers, and the use of liquid medications. There is a critical need for generalizable, rigorous study of medication error and injury in children with chronic conditions to inform intervention. Pediatric cancer is an ideal model condition to understand chronic disease care: medication under- and overdoses are life-threatening, all forms of medication are nationally (intravenous, pills, liquids), and our preliminary data indicates that the prevalence of injuries due to medicatin error is very high (3.6% children). Our long term objective is to support the safe and effective use of medications among ambulatory children. In this proposal, among children with cancer, we aim to: 1) categorize rates and types of ambulatory medication error, including caregiver error, and preventable adverse drug events; 2) identify the contribution of error to non-adherence; and 3) identify individual, family, and healthcare system factors that contribute to ambulatory medication error. Our team is ideally suited to perform the proposed work, combining nationally known experts in ambulatory medication errors, including caregiver administration, adherence, and human factors. We will conduct a longitudinal cohort study of 300 children with leukemia and lymphoma from three centers. Families will participate in three home visits. Errors will be measured using a four-component approach we developed and validated: medical record review, medication bottles review, observation of administration, and caregiver interview. Non-adherence will be measured electronic monitoring devices and self-report. We will identify factors that contribute to error using an environmental scan and standardized online questionnaires completed by caregivers. The proposed work will substantially contribute to our knowledge of the epidemiology of error and the range of types of injuries due to medication error. In addition, we will identify factors contributing to ambulatory safety, including provider-family interaction, protective behaviors and tools, and the role of the health system in ambulatory safety. This will be the first study, to our knowledge, of the relationship of adherence and error. Knowledge gained will immediately benefit patients, families, and clinicians who can then take steps to minimize errors and associated injury. Researchers may build on this knowledge to apply human factor theory, widely used in the inpatient setting, to the ambulatory setting in children. The proposed work provides the critical information needed to develop and test novel interventions targeting ambulatory medication error and associated injury."
"9551740","ABSTRACT These are exciting times as a blood test for traumatic brain injury (TBI) is on the horizon. This R01 competitive renewal is a large-scale validation study that will extend the work that was successfully completed on serum TBI biomarkers in adults to children and youth, a previously understudied group. This multicenter study will systematically validate the diagnostic and prognostic ability of well-studied brain-specific protein and novel microRNA blood-based biomarkers in children and youth with mild traumatic brain injury (MTBI) and concussion using methods that have been systematically used in the adult studies. The protein biomarkers proposed here have been studied in adults and were shown to provide strong correlation to level of injury. This study will expand the focus to include promising microRNA biomarkers that have shown great promise in recently published pilot work. Young trauma patients will be enrolled from the emergency departments of adult and pediatric Level 1 Trauma Centers and will have blood drawn as soon after injury as possible. The first aim of this study will be to determine the brain-specificity of candidate biomarkers in children and youth with MTBI within four hours of injury. These markers' levels will be measured to see if they are present in those with other types of traumatic injuries and in those who hit their head but have no symptoms. The study will also assess concussion symptom severity. Being able to objectively distinguish someone with and without a concussion would be especially helpful in children who are too young to talk, in those who are confused after their injury, or in those with conditions that limit their ability to communicate (such as autism). The second aim will be to determine the diagnostic performance of the candidate biomarkers in young patients to detect critical injuries such as intracranial injuries on CT scan and those requiring urgent neurosurgery. The goal is help physicians make decisions on whether a CT scan is warranted. This will potentially decrease the number of CT scans performed, thereby reducing children's exposure to ionizing radiation. The third aim will be to assess the subacute and chronic diagnostic and prognostic utility of serially measured biomarkers over six months post- injury to determine neuropsychological function. The protocol calls for taking blood samples over 6 months to assess the ability of the biomarkers to predict whether children and youth will have neuropsychological problems. It will also assist in understanding the pattern of biomarker release during recovery. The ultimate goal of this research is to improve the clinical care of children and youth with MTBI and concussion by early recognition of injury and clinically validating a panel of blood-based markers that could be used by clinicians in the acute, subacute, and chronic phases of injury to determine the need for diagnostic imaging (CT or MRI), neurosurgery, specialized rehabilitation or risk for neuropsychological problems. Hopefully the results of this proposal will change clinical practice by providing medical professionals with more sensitive and accessible tools to detect brain injury and help patients and their families better understand their injury and recovery."
"9395642","Fluidic Microdrives for Minimally Invasive Implantation and Actuation of Flexible Neural Electrodes Abstract Flexible microelectrodes that match the mechanical properties of the brain promise to increase the quality and longevity of neural recordings by reducing chronic inflammatory reactions; however, these microelectrodes are traditionally difficult to implant without causing acute damage. Because these flexible electrodes are typically more flexible than a human hair, stiffening agents are presently used to temporarily increase the overall size and rigidity of the electrode during implantation. The resulting increase in the electrode footprint damages the tissue, leading to cell loss and glial activation that persists even after the stiffening agents are removed or dissolve. Furthermore, once the electrodes are inserted, they remain fixed in place and cannot be repositioned to record from different brain regions.  To overcome the limitations of current flexible electrode implantation methods we propose ?fluidic microdrives?: specially designed microfluidic devices that can insert and microactuate bare flexible electrodes with no need for stiffening agents, thus reducing acute damage during electrode implantation. In this project we will demonstrate that fluidic microdrives can implant and actuate state-of-the art flexible multichannel electrodes in vivo. These experiments will represent the first studies of flexible electrode performance following a minimally invasive implantation. As part of this project we will assess the quality and longevity of neural recordings following fluidic implantation compared to conventional implantation using removable stiffeners. Overall, fluidic microdrive technology proposed here will provide a versatile method to reduce tissue damage associated with implantation and actuation of flexible neural electrodes that could be adapted to support a variety of electrode materials and geometries."
"9567704","Project Summary: Although there are numerous genetic variants associated with age-related degeneration (AMD), a meaningful fraction of missing heritability has yet to be exlained. Many studies have focused on identifying the common variants contributing to this disease in the general population. One aim of this project is to discover rare, highly penetrant genetic variants contributing to familial forms of AMD. The AMD Registry and Biorepository is a large cohort with unique characteristics that include standardized clinical phenotype data and longitudinal prospective data. Some families from this cohort have multiple members with advanced AMD that cannot be explained by known AMD-associated genetic variants and will be sequenced using next-generation sequencing to discover novel variants. Variants found to perfectly segregate with the disease in these families will be assessed for association with AMD in an independent case-control cohort. To discover additional genetic variants contributing to the missing heritability, a second aim is to assess known and novel genetic variants for their role in progression of AMD over time, particularly the effect each variant has on the initiation of the disease and the transition to early, intermediate, and advanced stages. To further the understanding of AMD as a complex trait, quantitative and semi-quantitative intermediate sub-phenotypes will be assessed for association with these genetic variants. Results from this study will fill gaps in our knowledge about the genetics of AMD. We will use these discoveries to develop improved predictive models for AMD progression, and our results may lead to more accurate diagnoses and better therapeutic targets. The ultimate goal is to prevent or slow the progression of AMD and reduce the burden of visual loss due to this disease."
"9327666","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Diabetes and its complications are among the largest contributors to healthcare costs, cost growth, and patient morbidity and mortality. Diabetes is often not timely diagnosed. When it is diagnosed, patients often fail to comply with a complex treatment regimen. The health burden of diabetes falls disproportionately on the poor and on ethnic minorities.  A central goal of our project is to examine how the ACA expansion of Medicaid will affect diabetes diagnosis, treatment, and outcomes among the newly enrolled. We will do so using the natural experiment that results from some states expanding Medicaid and others choosing not to do so; combined with detailed, longitudinal electronic health records (EHR) for a large population of 9 million persons in four expansion and five non-expansion states.  The combination of a multi-state shock to Medicaid eligibility and large-scale access to EHR is unique. Prior studies of adult Medicaid expansions have been small-scale, short-duration, lacked detailed health records, or a combination of these limitations. The best available study, the Oregon Health Insurance Experiment, compared 6,000 new Medicaid recipients to 6,000 controls in a single state, for a two-year period. The Oregon research found large increases in diabetes diagnosis and use of diabetes medication, but no significant change in blood sugar levels. Yet any effect of Medicaid on outcomes will emerge slowly. In contrast, we estimate that we will have 100-150,000 new Medicaid recipients, 5 years of pre-treatment data to establish baseline health and match treated individuals to controls, 6 years of post-treatment data in the study period (with potential follow-up after that), and several treated state, with different Medicaid programs, and potential to expand to additional states. This will let us study both near- and medium term outcomes, and assess whether treatment effects vary with personal characteristics or the nature of the Medicaid program.  A second project goal is to innovate in causal inference methods. We will combine difference-in-differences (DiD), matching, and multiple imputation methods. We will use matching and multiple imputation methods to match control persons in non-expansion states, to match to new Medicaid enrollees in expansion states. We will use distributed lag regressions to map the emergence of any treatment effect over time. DiD, matching, and multiple imputation methods have not to our knowledge been combined in a single study. This combined design will be useful in studying other health insurance expansions."

"9388399","Project Summary Combination therapy holds considerable promise for overcoming intrinsic and acquired resistance to targeted therapies but will rely on our ability to precisely identify the best drug combination for particular tumors. While immense focus exists on using genomic information to direct therapeutic approach, many resistance mechanisms do not rely on genetic changes and, in fact, can arise from entirely tumor-extrinsic factors within the microenvironment. For example, though the receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) AXL is widely implicated in resistance to targeted therapies such as those directed against EGFR, its regulation by phosphatidylserine, as opposed to mutation, amplification or autocrine ligand, make identifying the tumors that will respond to AXL- targeted therapy especially challenging.  We propose to study both downstream and receptor-proximal signaling during bypass resistance mediated by AXL, and then across a wider panel of RTKs. Integrating these measurements with quantitative modeling will identify the connectivity between receptors, interacting adapters, and downstream signaling events, thereby defining the essential set of signaling network changes required for tumor cell survival in response to targeted therapeutics. We will then apply this understanding by measuring RTK-adapter interaction using proximity ligation to predict the RTKs driving bypass resistance and test these predictions in a panel of patient-derived xenograft tumors.  This work will considerably improve our ability to identify effective drug combinations by (a) developing a mechanism-based assay for identifying which among many RTKs tumor cells are relying upon for survival, (b) improving our basic understanding of exactly how network-level bypass resistance arises due to activation of non-targeted RTKs both at the receptor-proximal and downstream signaling layer, and (c) expanding our understanding of the RTK AXL with links to resistance, tumor spread, and immune avoidance."
"9455067","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT One in 100 people worldwide has epilepsy, which causes substantial morbidity and mortality. A third of individuals with epilepsy do not respond to anticonvulsant medications; in these cases surgical resection of the seizure focus may lead to seizure freedom. However, surgical success depends upon identification of a structural epileptogenic lesion on MRI, and up to 50% of individuals with focal epilepsy have no lesion on standard MRI. Patients without identified lesions often require invasive intracranial monitoring to localize the seizure focus for surgery, with a greater risk of complications. Better tools are needed to identify the seizure onset zone and improve treatment for NLFE. Failure to identify lesions in focal epilepsy may result from two possible causes: 1) a structural lesion exists but is not detectable by current clinical MRI or 2) a structural lesion may not exist, i.e. the tissue abnormality is at the cellular or molecular level, or may not be discrete and spatially localized. This proposal focuses on the undetected structural lesion, aiming to improve upon current MRI techniques to increase the likelihood of finding a lesion responsible for seizures. The most frequently identified histopathology at surgery for NLFE is focal cortical dysplasia (FCD), particularly Type 1 where subtle laminar disorganization is present. We hypothesize that epileptogenic abnormalities, particularly FCD Type 1, can be detected preoperatively in NLFE by identification of 1) increased regional blurring of the cortical grey matter/white matter (GM/WM) boundary, 2) microstructural tissue diffusion abnormalities, and 3) decreased regional cortical thickness. We will apply advanced MRI technologies and computational morphometric analysis to identify these subtle structural abnormalities in individuals with NLFE. The Co-PI (Winawer) has an NIH-funded R01 to identify molecular abnormalities in resected brain tissue of individuals undergoing surgery for NLFE. This provides a framework for recruitment of participants for our imaging study and a unique opportunity to compare histology and imaging in a well-characterized cohort. Our Study Aims are to: 1: Use advanced whole brain 3T MRI paired with computational morphometric analysis and multi-shell diffusion imaging to detect regional blurring of the GM/WM boundary and microstructural tissue diffusion abnormalities, and identify areas of decreased regional cortical thickness in our cohort of individuals with NLFE; and 2: Use high-resolution 7T MRI paired with computational morphometric analysis to detect regional blurring of the GM/WM boundary and reduced cortical thickness in NLFE. Novel computational morphometric techniques will allow objective statistical assessment of structural differences. The immediate goal of our project is to detect epileptogenic lesions undiscovered by current clinical MRI and other noninvasive imaging modalities, and to better understand structural pathologies underlying NLFE. Our long-term goal is to improve surgical outcome in NLFE, resulting in better seizure control and quality of life."
"9384354","Project Summary The long-term goal of this project is to improve both the diagnoses and the treatments of Leber congenital amaurosis (LCA). LCA is a set of inherited, early onset retinopathies that affect about 1 in 50,000 in the general U.S. population and accounts for more than 5% of all retinal dystrophies. The molecular basis for LCA is heterogeneous with mutations in 22 different genes that have been associated with the disease. Strikingly, ciliopathy has been identified as one of the major causes of LCA with 25% of the known disease- causing genes involved in proper cilia formation and function in photoreceptor cells. However, despite the large number of retinal disease genes related to cilium function, the precise disease mechanisms remain largely unknown. We have recently identified that Spata7, a ciliopathy gene, maintains a photoreceptor- specific transition zone (PSTZ), which is a specialized structure in photoreceptor connecting cilia and plays a critical role in protein trafficking. In this proposal, we plan to utilize Spata7 as an entry point to better understand the function of this novel PSTZ zone in the connecting cilium of photoreceptor cells. Our Specific Aims are to: Specific Aim 1: Define and characterize two novel zones of the connecting cilium. Specific Aim 2. Determine the mechanism of SPATA7 action in RPGR complex assembly and function in the distal TZ of photoreceptor cilia. Specific Aim 3: Determine the role of Spata7 in PSTZ structure and function. Together these studies will provide a systematic evaluation of the PSTZ structure, key protein composition, regulation, and function, thereby providing novel insights concerning the molecular mechanisms of protein trafficking through the connecting cilium of photoreceptor cells. Given the central role primary cilia play not only in retinal disease, but also many other syndromic pathologies, these aims have the potential to make a high impact in our understanding of and ability to diagnose and treat human disease."
"9526730","Substance use disorder (SUD), a chronic, relapsing disorder with limited treatment options, costs the US ~$700 billion annually. A few, moderately effective replacement therapies exist for opiate, nicotine and alcohol dependence. However, no such options exist for stimulant dependence and, further, there are no pharmacotherapies to prevent or even reduce relapse associated with any drug class. Associations that have formed during periods of drug use serve as powerful relapse factors by triggering motivation to seek the drug. Recently, the synaptic actin cytoskeleton, a critical regulator of memory, was identified as a biological target for the selective disruption of these associations. Indeed, intra-CNS actin depolymerization produces an immediate and persistent loss of well-established memories associated with the stimulant methamphetamine (METH), without affecting other types of memories. However, ?-actin, the isoform implicated in neuronal plasticity, serves critical functions throughout the body. Therefore, efforts turned to an upstream regulator of the actin cytoskeleton, nonmuscle myosin II (NMII), a more selectively expressed molecular motor that promotes synaptic actin polymerization. All results with direct actin depolymerization have been recapitulated with Blebbistatin, a small molecule inhibitor of NMIIs. Importantly, a single treatment with Blebbistatin is sufficient to produce a seemingly permanent loss of METH-associated memories. In addition to its efficacy in animal relapse models, several properties make Blebbistatin an excellent scaffold for medicinal chemistry. Paramount among these are the molecule?s small size, selectivity for myosin IIs, high brain penetration, and rapid clearance from plasma and brain (short-acting is sufficient and reduces unwanted peripheral and central effects). Unfortunately, Blebbistatin?s activity at cardiac muscle myosin IIs is likely a liability. Optimization efforts have been limited because the therapeutic potentials of NMII inhibition have only been realized in the past few years. Thus, the central goal of this proposal is to develop a safe and selective NMII small molecule inhibitor with improved potency and solubility, that retains its existing, advantageous DMPK properties with minimized toxicological parameters. To accomplish the overall goal of developing an IND ready compound, an extensive pharmaceutical approach to drug discovery and development centered on Blebbistatin analogs will be employed, centered on a detailed structure activity relationship approach. A team has been assembled with many years of preclinical drug development experience that encompasses all of the methodologies employed in this project (medicinal chemistry, biochemistry, cell biology, neurobiology, in vivo pharmacology, drug metabolism and pharmacokinetics (DMPK), toxicology, and clinical research), making this team uniquely qualified to direct the program. By capitalizing on the unique therapeutic discovery and development capabilities at Scripps Florida, this proposal is expected to yield a safe, efficacious compound with sufficient preclinical safety data to support human clinical trials focused on SUD relapse."
"9538992","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This Application seeks funding for a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial of aspirin in primary prevention in healthy elderly people aged 70 years and over. Its purpose is to determine whether low dose aspirin will extend the duration of disability-free life in an aging population. The study will examine whether the potential benefits of this drug (particularly the prevention of heart disease, stroke and vascular dementia) outweigh the risks of severe bleeding in this age group.      19,000 participants will be recruited from community settings in the United States and Australia and randomized to daily 100 mg of enteric-coated aspirin or placebo. Follow-up is for an average of 5 years. The trial methods are based around the successful conduct of large-scale clinical outcome studies in both countries, e.g., ALLHAT, 2nd Australian National Blood Pressure study.      The ASPREE study accords with the first of the four major goals of the National Institute of Aging - to improve the health and quality of life of older people. The Action Plan for Aging Research of the NIA points out that since the beginning of the 20th century, life expectancy at birth in the U.S. has increased from less than 50 years to more than 76 years. From 1960 to 2000 there was an approximate doubling of people aged 65 and over. It is further predicted that by the year 2030, the number of individuals aged 65 and over will double again to reach 70.3 million (constituting 20% of the population). Dramatic growth in the elderly population is also predicted in the number of Americans aged 85 and over to reach 19.4 million (4.8% of the population in 2050). As life expectancy increases, there is now a greater need to keep these additional years free of disease and disability.      At present, the use of aspirin for primary prevention is based largely on studies in middle aged adults where the incidence of adverse affects is low. However, the risk benefit ratio of this agent in older persons is an area of continuing controversy. This is reflected by incorporating aspirin therapy into some widely respected clinical guidelines, despite the failure of the FDA cardio-renal Drugs Panel to endorse its use in this setting. The result of the ASPREE aspirin study will have the potential to alter clinical practice for the majority of the older U.S. population where approximately 60% of those over 65 are free of heart disease, stroke and mental or physical disability. Its relevance is enhanced by the data suggesting that aspirin may delay the onset of cognitive decline and some forms of cancer. However, recent experience with other major drug therapies newly introduced, e.g., HRT, COX-2 inhibitors and anti-oxidant vitamins, has emphasized the need to formally establish safety and efficacy before such therapies enter routine practice."
"9346373","VIGILANT DIAGNOSTICS  NIAID/NIH STTR Phase I Application Vastly improved influenza diagnostics through the development of a portable thermal contrast reader PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Despite recent advances in rapid influenza diagnostic tests, false negatives stemming from poor sensitivity contribute to nosocomial transmission and prevent thousands from receiving appropriate antiviral treatment. Among vulnerable populations, the consequences can be grave. The population under five years of age experienced hospitalization rates of 46.9/100,000, with 96 influenza-associated pediatric deaths during the 2013- 2014 influenza season and 348 deaths in the 2009 pandemic. Influenza-associated hospitalization rates were 54.3/100,000 for those 50-64 years and 88.1/100,000 for those over 65 years.  We have developed a desktop system that uses a thermal contrast assay (TCA) reader to detect gold nanoparticles used in nearly all lateral flow assays (LFAs) for influenza. With this TCA reader, we have demonstrated an 8-fold improvement in sensitivity over results from the industry-leading handheld BD Veritor? system in a flu A antigen dilution study. We propose to begin commercializing this TCA reader technology by 1) Building a prototype portable TCA reader that is functionally equivalent to the existing desktop TCA reader and 2) Testing this prototype portable TCA reader alongside an existing visual flu LFA (i.e. BD Veritor? or other) system, the desktop TCA reader, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing in a clinical setting. To build a prototype of the portable TCA reader, we will first test and validate new (and cheaper) handheld components for functional equivalency with the corresponding fully characterized component in the desktop TCA reader. We will then assemble the parts with a custom-designed LFA holder into a functioning portable TCA reader. Further, we will work to develop proprietary Windows based software and algorithms for control of the prototype. The prototype TCA reader will be tested on up to 400 discarded influenza LFAs. We will also compare to the corresponding nasopharyngeal samples that generated the LFAs to allow for correlative ?gold standard? PCR testing. The visual results of these LFAs will be known. We will then test the visually negative LFAs with the portable TCR reader prototype. After the corresponding nasopharyngeal swabs undergo PCR testing, all results will be compared.  This portable TCA reader system will then be a prototype for a low-cost, high-sensitivity, easy-to-use point- of-care influenza diagnostic system that will reduce false negatives over today?s industry-leading handheld BD Veritor? and other visual based flu LFAs."
"9394533","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Infants born very preterm (28-31 weeks post-menstrual age (PMA)) are at an increased risk for impaired neurodevelopment as a result of their preterm birth and extended hospitalization in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). Very preterm infants experience poorer cognitive, motor, behavioral, and socioemotional functioning compared to healthy infants born at term, which may persist into late childhood and early adulthood. Preterm infants are exposed to numerous experiential (e.g. painful procedures), environmental (e.g. sensory stimulation), and physiologic (e.g. sepsis, critical illness) stressors during their hospitalization which may affect their long-term neurodevelopment. Researchers have suggested a direct causal pathway linking inflammation with brain injury and impaired neurodevelopment in preterm infants. Determining the potentially modifiable mediators linking stress and neurodevelopment is paramount to improve the long-term outcomes of very preterm infants. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the relationships among stress exposure, inflammation, and neurodevelopment in very preterm infants. This study will accomplish the following specific aims: (1) determine the relationships among stress exposure, inflammation, and neurodevelopment in very preterm infants, (2) determine the effect of stress exposure on weekly changes in inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines from one week of age until 35 weeks PMA, and (3) examine the correlation between a published scale of NICU stress exposure and chronic stress response measured by hair cortisol concentration in very preterm infants. Cumulative and weekly stress exposure scores will be calculated using the Neonatal Infant Stressor Scale (NISS). Inflammation will be measured with a panel of pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines, quantified by multi-plex assay. Neurodevelopment will be assessed using the Neurobehavioral Assessment of the Preterm Infant (NAPI). The study includes an exploratory aim to measure the correlation between NISS scores and hair cortisol concentration, an innovative approach to the measurement of a chronic stress response in hospitalized preterm infants. This study aligns with the National Institute of Nursing Research?s mission to promote life-long wellness and is an important step in the development of targeted interventions to optimize neurodevelopmental outcomes for preterm infants. The training plan will provide the applicant with numerous formal and informal opportunities for professional development while allowing the applicant to build a solid foundation for a successful career as an independent researcher. This study builds on the applicant?s experiences as a NICU nurse and research assistant and integrates her knowledge of biology, nursing, and molecular biology lab techniques."

"9508782","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This renewal builds on the progress in current funding. ADAM10 was shown to be quite important in humoral immune function. Mice in which their B cells lack ADAM10 (ADAM10B-/-) had defective lymphoid architecture. We will examine whether multiple antigen injections can overcome the defects seen. Newly data indicates that B cell TNF production is responsible for the altered germinal center architecture seen in the ADAM10B-/- mice and that this is due to increased expression of the TNF sheddase ADAM17. The opposite effects for ADAM10 will also be examined, namely what happens when ADAM10 is overexpressed in B cells. Early overexpression in hematopoietic stem cells was shown to block B cell production in the current funding period. Incorporation of a floxxed stop site in fron of the ADAM10 will allow delay of the overexpression until B cells develop. In addition, the ADAM17B-/- mouse should also have elevated ADAM10 expression and enhanced Ig production. Of particular interest is IgE production and we hypothesize that elevated IgE production will correlate with elevated B cell ADAM10. With respect to ADAM10 targets important in B cell function, based on preliminary data, we will concentrate on two substrates, CD23 and fractalkine. Finally, we will examine whether B cell exosomes play a role in the immunostimulatory activity of IgE-antigen complexes. In the second aim, mice with elevated B cell ADAM10 will be examined for enhanced lung inflammation in mouse asthma models and the effect of ADAM10 inhibitors will be examined to determine if this mechanism is solely ADAM10 related. The effect of ADAM10 inhibitors on the lymphoid architecture of the bronchial associated lymphoid tissues will be determined. Using IgE reporter mice, we will specifically determine the effect of ADAM10 inhibitors and ADAM10B-/- mice for germinal center and IgE plasma cell levels. We anticipate that when ADAM10 levels are inhibited we can specifically inhibit the IgE response. Using a model we have developed for suppression of an ongoing asthma response, ADAM10 inhibitors will be examined for their capacity to block this response. Mice lacking ADAM10 in their epithelial cells will be studied to determine whether ADAM10 inhibitors are working primarily by their effect on immune cells. Preliminary evidence indicates that a subpopulation of active allergic patients have elevated B cell ADAM10 levels when compared to controls. We will examine if the B cells from these patients have enhanced IgE production, using in vitro B cell stimulation models. Overall, the project will continue studies ino new promising avenues for understanding and harnessing ADAM10 to control the immune response. In addition, these two aims test the hypothesis that the ratio of ADAM10 to ADAM17 is important especially with respect to the allergic phenotype."
"9338116","ABSTRACT Sexual Violence (SV) and Teen Dating Violence (TDV) are significant public health concerns in the United States. Within Michigan, 5,500 sexual assaults were reported, more that 20% of which occur in Wayne County. More than 100,000 domestic violence offenses were reported to police in Michigan in 2009, however factors including gender, race, and socio-economic status influence decisions to contact legal systems. Understanding modifiable protective factors that may be efficacious in prevention is essential, including social norms and social connectedness, and how these may be leveraged in a context-specific approach to prevent IPV and SV. The aim of the research is to adapt, implement and evaluate an empirically-based developmentally appropriate, primary prevention strategy for SV and TDV perpetration, focused on influencing community-level change through youth empowerment and positive youth development to build social connectedness, improve bystander intervention, and improve social norms. The role of technology in TDV and SV, as well as a gender sensitive lens regarding the similarities and difference in the mechanism, meaning and context of violence will be examined. The central hypothesis is that a student-driven primary prevention strategy, focusing on social norms and school and community connectedness, implemented in middle school settings will be effective in reducing the incidence of SV and TDV. Using a group randomized trial, the proposed study seeks to disentangle relationships between SV and IPV perpetration, youth empowerment, social connectedness, and social norms. The intervention and research will be conducted in collaboration with six high schools in Wayne County, Michigan, including focus groups, process observation, and biannual survey research. The intervention will be infused within the school curriculum as an elective for ninth and tenth grades students. Students who provide youth assent and parental consent will be surveyed six times over three years, starting with the ninth and tenth grades. Youth and parents will be recruited to participate in focus groups to inform the adaptation of the intervention strategy and provide greater understanding of the survey research. Extensive measures will be taken to preserve the confidentiality of research participants. At the end of each year, data sharing and assistance with interpretation will take place in a collaboration between the research team and intervention schools to strengthen infrastructure. Intervention and comparison schools will also be provided training and capacity building at the end of the project to promote sustainability. Analysis will be conducted using hierarchical linear modeling and structural equation modeling. A nested model structure that analyzes the hierarchical nature of the study variables will be used to estimate the effects of individual, relational, school, and community-level risk and protective factors for IPV and SV perpetration. An initial sample of 2,000 is desired have adequate power for complex analysis despite attrition."
"9323298","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a multifaceted disorder that almost certainly arises (most commonly) from a complex interplay between genetic risk, environmental exposure and stochastic events. Increasingly, it is also recognized that the clinical course of disease is determined independently of the risk of disease. And while some genetic determinants of disease progression have been identified, almost nothing is known about the environmental factors that impact the course of disease. This study will examine the influence of non-genetic factors and gene-environmental interactions on ALS disease progression, and will also explore the influence of gene-environmental interactions on the odds of developing ALS. These goals will be accomplished by leveraging the significant opportunity afforded to us by the recent establishment of the Clinical Research in ALS and related disorders for Therapeutic Development (CReATe) Consortium as part of the NIH-funded Rare Diseases Clinical Research Network (RDCRN). We will add detailed environmental exposure data to the prospectively and systematically collected deep phenotypic data and whole genome sequencing data that CReATe will collect on 500 patients with ALS, and will employ innovative approaches such as case-only analyses and Mendelian Randomization to address our specific aims. Importantly, this work will also elucidate an approach for future meaningful use of the `case-only' environmental exposure data being collected through the online portal of the National ALS Registry. This work, therefore, advances of the over-arching aims of the National ALS Registry and looks to the future as the scope of the National ALS Registry potentially broadens to encompass longitudinal data collection as well as banking of biological samples (including DNA)."
"9287461","Project Summary Age-related cataract is associated with extensive deamidation, racemization, and isomerization of crystallins, the major refractive proteins of the lens. Extensive studies by our laboratories and others have found deamidation significantly decreases the stability of crystallins with minimal structural perturbations. However, these deamidation mimics created using mutagenesis did not readily aggregate in vitro. We hypothesize that this is because they were lacking racemization and isomerization, two modifications accompanying deamidation that may be more disruptive to crystallin structure than deamidation alone. Unlike deamidation, these modifications cannot be introduced into crystallins by genetic means. This has prevented studies to gauge the importance of these additional modifications in age-related cataract. Therefore, the purpose of these experiments is to create ?S-crystallins containing specific sites of physiologically relevant racemized and isomerized aspartates that result from the age-related deamidation process and determine their effect on protein structure. The specific aims are to: 1) use synthetic heavy peptide standards and high-resolution mass spectrometry to determine the relative proportion of different racemized and isomerized aspartates in ?S- crystallin from the insoluble protein of aged cataractous human lenses so that relevant species can be selected, 2) introduce these racemized and isomerized residues into ?S-crystallin using semi-synthetic processes that have never before been used in the lens field, and 3) examine the result of these modifications on ?S-crystallin structure using protein stability and light scattering measurements, hydrogen/deuterium exchange mass spectrometry, and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. These experiments will, for the first time, critically test the potential impact of age-related racemization and isomerization on crystallin structure. These results could play an important role in slowing cataract development by developing drugs that specifically prevent the aggregation and light scatter of racemized and isomerized crystallins in aged lenses."
"9321802","The impact of meditation on the regulation of emotion is perhaps the most salient effect of meditation for the  average practitioner. Yet the mechanisms responsible for these alterations are pooriy understood and the  consequences of these changes have not been characterized. The purpose of this project is to examine the  impact of these two forms of meditation on the neural, biobehavioral and hormonal correlates of emotion  regulation among naive practitioners who learn Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) and among  Long-Term Meditators (LTMs). The MBSR group will be compared with our rigorous comparison  intervention, the Health Enhancement Program (HEP) and to Wait List (WL) controls. Both of the active  groups will be administered booster training following the completion of the 8-week course to maximize  consolidation of learning and increase the amount of practice. These groups will be tested before and after  training. The LTMs will be studied on three occasions: once with no practice period prior to testing, once  after an intensive day of MM practice and once after an intensive day of LKM-CO practice. Participants will  be tested on an emotion regulation task in the scanner during which four conditions will be randomly  interspersed across blocks: MM, LKM-CO, relaxation and listening to music. The task will consist of the  presentation of pictures depicting human suffering (negative) or human flourishing (positive) while  participants engage in one of the four regulatory conditions. Facial electromyography (fEMG) will be  recorded from corrugator and zygomatic muscle regions in the scanner to provide real-time online objective  measures of emotion during the regulation conditions. Saliva will be collected for three consecutive days,  three times/day just prior to each lab visit to provide measures of Cortisol and total Cortisol output to relate to  the fMRI measures. We predict that MM will primarily impact fronto-amgydala circutiry and LKM-CO will  impact fronto-striatal circuitry and that these neural changes will have downstream biobehavioral effects on  reports of daily mood, Cortisol and immune measures collected in this and the other two CERC projects."
"9531663","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal investigates the underlying causes of human ocular diseases using mouse models, focusing on both the Notch signaling pathway, which is broadly required during development, and two classes of bHLH transcription factors (Atoh7/Neurog2 or Hes genes). The activities of both types of factors are regulated by Notch signaling, in particular developmental contexts. The Notch pathway is also responsible for regulating cell proliferation, morphogenesis, differentiation, apoptosis and stem cell maintenance. Dominant mutations in the human Notch pathway genes JAG1 and NOTCH2 cause Alagille syndrome, in which some patients exhibit eye deformities. This proposal will use complex conditional (cre-lox) mouse strains, including double and triple mutants, histology, immunohistochemistry, confocal microscopy, in situ hybridization, mouse embryology, flow cytometry, NEXTgen sequencing, bioinformatics, ChIP, qPCR, and PCR technologies to address basic, mechanistic questions about retinal neuron formation. We will address two important questions, namely 1) Which genes regulate optic nerve head development and maintain the boundary between the retina and optic stalk? 2) What controls retinal progenitor cell differentiation into either a retinal ganglion cell or a cone photoreceptor neuron?"
"9359988","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this research is to investigate the effect of children's early language exposure on the neural mechanisms underlying language development. Neuroscience research provides increasing evidence that early experiences interact with genes to shape the brain and its functioning. Though the brain remains plastic throughout life, many critical neural circuits, such as those for language and communication, are established during sensitive periods in the first few years of life, after which new learning is more difficult to accomplish. Furthermore, abundant child development research reveals that both the quantity and quality of a child's language exposure during this sensitive period impacts his/her linguistic and cognitive abilities throughout life, and that parents from lower socioeconomic status (SES; a combination of education, occupation, and income) backgrounds tend to speak fewer and lower quality utterances to their children. Currently, there is work linkin neural structure and function with distal social contexts such as SES; however, there is no research examining the effect of more malleable proximal social contexts, such daily language exposure, on the brain. This is not a trivial gap, because proximal environments are the most amenable to intervention. I will investigate this experience-brain connection in an SES-diverse sample of five-year-old children and their parents. I will record an entire day of the child's auditory exposure from his/her perspective, and then analyze the recording for the quantity of language input (total number of adult words and conversational turns) and the quality of language input (the diversity and sophistication of vocabulary/grammar). Children and parents will also complete standardized behavioral assessments of their language facility and cognitive skills, and children will participate in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and diffusion  tensor imaging (DTI). I will test the hypothesis that, controlling for SES, reported stress levels,  and other non-linguistic environmental factors, the quantity and quality of children's linguistic input will have a significant and separable effect on their (1) behavioral linguistic abilities, (2 pattern of neural activation during a sentence comprehension task, and (3) hemispheric asymmetry in the gray and white matter supporting the canonical language network of the brain (left inferior frontal and superior temporal regions). Furthermore, I will compare across SES groups to see if low-SES children exhibit stronger input-output relationships, which would highlight the importance of language experience in at-risk populations, and I will look within the low-SES group specifically to explore which aspect of language stimulation (quantity, quality, or both) most facilitates linguistic and cognitive development, despite environmental risks. In sum, this is an innovative approach to directly relate daily experience to the developing brain in order  to elucidate factors contributing to drastic SES-related differences language and cognitive abilities. Importantly, the results will shed light on a malleable experiential factor and early intervention target that may transcend these group-level trends to shape both brain and behavior."
"9323805","Endocytic trafficking is central to normal cell function, and dysregulation is the underlying cause for diseases as diverse as atherosclerosis, diabetes and cancer. My laboratory has contributed to understanding the mechanisms by which membranes and receptors are recycled via the endocytic recycling compartment (ERC) to the plasma membrane (PM). Endocytic recycling remains one of the least studied endocytic pathways; in particular, the involvement of membrane tubules in the recycling process is poorly understood, and the roles of the various forms of tubular endosomes, and the mechanisms by which these structures are generated and undergo vesiculation remain a major unanswered question. There are multiple `types' of endosome-derived tubular carriers (EDTC), including sorting nexin-BAR (SNX-BAR) domain and retromer-derived tubules, and networks of endosomal tubules, such as tubular recycling endosomes (TRE) decorated by MICAL-L1, Syndapin2 (Synd2) and Eps15 Homology Domain (EHD) proteins. Little is known about how these apparently different EDTC integrate their functions, or even whether retromer and SXN-BAR EDTC are distinct from TRE. Recent studies demonstrate that EHD proteins and MICAL-L1 interact with components of the retromer complex, suggesting that these tubular networks are related. Our central hypothesis is that overlapping and distinct tubular membranes coordinate transport from endosomes to the PM and the Golgi. In this proposal, we will uncover the functional and physical relationships between TRE, retromer and SNX-BAR-derived EDTC. Moreover, we will focus on a mechanistic understanding of the mode by which EDTC are generated, and how they undergo vesiculation to promote transport within the cell. Aim 1: To examine the relationship and functional roles of EDTC. Tubular endosomes play major roles in endocytic membrane trafficking. EDTC include a number of retromer-containing structures, retromer-independent tubules generated by SNX-BAR domain proteins, and TRE decorated by MICAL-L1, the BAR domain protein Synd2, and EHD proteins. We will examine the cross-talk and cross-regulation of these pathways with regard to the generation and fission of recycling tubules, and the control of endocytic recycling. Aim 2: To define and elucidate the spatio-temporal regulation and mechanism of TRE biogenesis and vesiculation. Our working hypothesis is that phosphatidic acid generation leads to recruitment of the membrane hub, MICAL-L1 and the F-BAR protein Synd2, to generate and remodel TRE. We further hypothesize that EHD3 plays an essential role in this process by stabilizing MICAL-L1-Synd2 interactions. Our studies on the cellular, organellar, molecular and atomic levels will use techniques ranging from structural biology to super-resolution microscopy and novel biophysical vesiculation assays, providing crucial knowledge of the functional role of the poorly understood TRE and retromer-SNX-BAR derived tubules, and their biogenesis and vesiculation."
"9326004","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): An EHS-Net site is proposed consisting of the three largest governmental jurisdictions within Harris County, Texas, the third largest county in the United States. The jurisdictions, responsible for a total of 23,700 fixed retail and mobile food establishments with a combined force of 58 food inspectors, have a support network of a food safety science research program within a large local university, city and county epidemiologists, health educators, audio-visual technologists, public information specialists, and access to state and state laboratories. The site is capable and willing to collect environmental data during foodborne illness outbreak investigations, participate in national EHS-Net studies, and implement its own practice-based research study. To ensure maximum efficiency and effectiveness in its efforts to reduce foodborne illness risk factors in Harris County, the Harris County EHS-Network proposes a non-conventional food safety training technique in the form of behavior modification methods supported by non-verbal and bilingual training aids for small retail food establishment that lack an internal support network to promote and ensure food safety best practices. The research team, including professors experienced in organizational culture and diversity issues, will identify the most prevalent foodborne illness risk factors in a study of small, non-incorporated restaurants, meat markets, flea market food establishments and mobile food establishments in Harris County by administering the FDA foodborne illness risk factor survey, a knowledge-based survey for food managers and food handlers as well as by collecting and analyzing food and environmental samples. An educational toolkit consisting of behavior modification methods and bi-lingual and non-verbal training materials will be created and tested at a sample of the four establishment types. The research team will assess and analyze the effectiveness of the toolkit through re-administration of the knowledge and risk factor surveys after the training intervention, modifying the behavior modification methods and training aids as needed. The educational toolkit will be available through electronic means for simple and fast application by other jurisdictions and managers. The practice-based research in this proposal is significant because developing behavior modification training methods through the use of modeling and non-verbal training aids tailored to meet needs of small food operations with a diverse population of food handlers will help ensure that food safety is not only being learned, but the knowledge is being translated into practice and incorporated into standard operating procedures and into a culture of food safety."
"9240057","Project Summary/Abstract Studies of visual working memory, the process of maintenance and manipulation of information during goal directed behaviors, often involve comparisons of visual stimuli across time and space. Such tasks require subjects to identify these stimuli, retain them in memory and retrieve them at the time of comparison. Thus, the circuitry underlying such tasks must involve cortical regions sub-serving sensory processing, maintenance, attention and decision-making. For our studies of visual working memory we chose tasks involving memory-guided comparisons of visual motion since the neural code of this dimension and the cortical areas involved in its processing have been examined in some detail. For that reason, we focused on two reciprocally interconnected regions, the area playing a key role in processing of visual motion, area MT, and the lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC), linked to attention, memory and executive control. Our lesion and single cell recording studies linked both areas to the ability to remember visual motion. Specifically, the damage of either LPFC or MT resulted in deficits in remembering visual motion. Furthermore, recording studies revealed motion signals in the LPFC likely to be supplied by MT and memory and comparison signals in MT likely to reflect influences from LPFC neurons. We hypothesize that the content and the dynamics of memory-related activity in MT and LPFC is a product of the interactions between neurons in the two areas during which they process and exchange motion signals generated during the task. In this renewal application we will address this hypothesis directly by simultaneously recording activity of multiple neurons in both areas, with the focus on memory-related signals represented in each area and on dynamic interactions between them during comparisons of directions of two moving stimuli separated by a delay. In our analysis we will focus on the nature of activity recorded simultaneously from multiple MT and LPFC neurons during the memory delay and during the comparison phase of the task and examine the interactions between neurons in the two areas (Aim 1). We will also reversibly inactivate localized sites in the LPFC, to examine LPFC influences on memory-related activity recorded in area MT during working memory tasks (Aim 2). To reveal the nature of memory-related signals and their interactions in the two areas we will focus on the memory delay and the comparison stage of the task. We will examine activity of simultaneously recorded neurons in each area on a trial-by-trial basis, apply population decoding algorithms, examine inter-neuronal and inter-areal noise correlations and synchrony while manipulating stimulus locations and task demands. The focus on the activity of simultaneously recorded neurons across the MT-LPFC network represents an important shift of emphasis from individual neurons to a more synergistic view of cortical function. This change of focus and the use of state-of-the-art techniques will allow us to identify network dynamics and codes that underlie memory and comparison processes during motion direction discrimination tasks."

"9331323","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Youth violence is a serious public health issue, particularly in the disproportionate burden upon economically disadvantaged, inner city, and minority populations. Intentional injury is the leading cause of death among persons 10 to 24 years of age in Kentucky, and the second leading cause of death for this age group nationally. Alarmingly, Kentucky's homicide rate for this same age group is 10 times higher for Black males (38.7/100,000) than for White males (3.9/100,000). In Louisville, KY, substantial social and health disparities-including violence and related risk factors-are concentrated in West Louisville (WL), an economically disadvantaged, urban, primarily Black community. Led by the School of Public Health & Information Sciences (SPHIS), researchers at the University of Louisville (UofL) propose to establish the UofL Youth Violence Prevention Center, partnering with researchers from Vanderbilt University. The specific aims of the proposed center include: 1. Strengthen the infrastructure to support youth violence prevention research and practice at the University of Louisville. 2. Develop, implement and evaluate a community-level social norming campaign to change the norms of violence among youth in West Louisville using mass and social media. 3. Document the development and implementation of the social norming campaign to improve replication and scalability in other settings or communities. 4. Evaluate the relationship between community readiness, community capacity, and the implementation of the community-level social norming campaign. 5. Disseminate study findings in meaningful and actionable format to a variety of relevant audiences (i.e., community, local organizations and leaders, youth violence prevention researchers and practitioners, academic peers, and policy-makers). The interdisciplinary research team proposes a quasi-experimental design to examine the effectiveness of using a community-level 3-year social norming campaign utilizing new media to change norms of violence among youth 10-24 and introduce prosocial norms driven by cultural identity, with WL as the intervention community and East Nashville, TN as the control community. The researchers and a team of community collaborators will with a professional advertising agency to plan and design the campaign, which will be deployed in Year 2. Surveys and interviews will capture data measuring our dependent variables of social norms and violent behavior (independent variables: campaign exposure by media type, demographics), and population-level youth violence data from schools, emergency departments, and local police departments will offer measures of change in serious youth violence at the population level."

"9484828","Abstract - Project 1  TITLE: Development and pilot testing of an implicit bias training intervention for  providers to advance equity in healthcare  The overall goal and theme of the Duke Center for Research to Advance Equity in Healthcare is  to reduce racial and ethnic disparities in health through interventions that affect the clinical  encounter. To achieve this goal, there is an urgent need for interventions that address implicit  bias in healthcare. Implicit bias training is widely used to raise self-awareness and provide self-  management tools. Our overall objective is to test the hypothesis that implicit bias training for  healthcare providers will reduce racial/ethnic disparities in patient-centered care. The proposed  project will lay the groundwork for testing that hypothesis by using patient focus groups to  garner a deeper understanding of perceptions of implicit bias in the clinical encounter; provider  and health system stakeholder semi-structured interviews to inform refinement of the existing  implicit bias training at Duke; and perform a pilot study of implicit bias training for providers. At  the conclusion of this study, we will have the necessary preliminary data to propose a definitive  trial to determine the impact of an implicit bias training intervention for providers on racial/ethnic  disparities in patient-centered care. This research will ultimately lead to the delivery of equitable,  evidence-based, patient-centered care for all."
"9367887","Barriers to medication adherence are common in youth with chronic illness and are a source of racial/ethnic disparities in underserved communities. An inherited blood disease, Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) is characterized by chronic and acute illness and reduced quality of life (QOL). It affects African Americans and other underserved communities. Hydroxyurea (HU) is the sole FDA-approved drug therapy for SCD and is highly effective and improves QOL. Poor adherence is common among youth and young adults with SCD. This application, ?Hydroxyurea Adherence for Personal Best in Sickle Cell Treatment: HABIT,? responds to PA-14-029, ?Chronic Condition Self-Management in Children and Adolescents.? The proposed study, a 5-site four-year randomized control trial (RCT), stems directly from our recent R21-funded feasibility study of the same title. Overall goals of reducing barriers to HU use and improving adherence for youth 10-18 years through creation of a daily medication habit. The HABIT feasibility study was delivered to a multi-ethnic sample of parent-youth dyads by culturally aligned community health workers (CHWs), augmented by customized text messaging. The 2-site study demonstrated intervention feasibility and acceptability in a multi-ethnic sample, as well as a sufficient effect on the primary outcomes to power a multi-site efficacy trial. The goal of the proposed multi-site study is to test the efficacy of the HABIT intervention at 6 months and sustainability of the effect at 12 months. The importance of the problem of poor medication adherence, use of CHWs to bridge the gap between health services and underserved parent-youth dyads affected by SCD, the strength of the science, the success of our multi-ethnic feasibility study and the potential application of study findings to youth with other serious chronic illnesses speak to the importance of this trial. Specific Aims: Study aims are to test the efficacy of the HABIT intervention to: Aim 1: Improve daily HU adherence, the primary outcome operationalized two ways: biomarker (approach or exceed a historical Personal best HbF) and pharmacy refill (primary outcome); Aim 2: Improve youth quality of life and self-management responsibility concordance measured by three secondary outcomes: generic and disease-specific QOL and parent/youth concordance regarding delegation of self-management responsibility (secondary outcome); Aim 3: Improve health status measured by two secondary outcomes: acute hospital use (12 month hospital length of stay, admissions and emergency room visits) and self-reported disease symptoms (fatigue, pain interference and intensity); Aim 4: Qualitatively assess impact and sustainability of the intervention on developing a daily medication HU habit from the perspectives of the community health workers (CHWs) and youth-parent-dyads using focus group and individual interviews. If proven efficacious, this approach could be adapted to youth affected by other serious chronic conditions."
"9350055","A significant, but under-recognized problem in clinical medicine is the accuracy of test interpretation and decision-making regarding treatment. Fewer than 20% of physicians understand the frequency of false positives in testing. When given an example of testing for a rare disease with a 95% specific test, most physicians answered that 95% of positive tests were true positive (vs. ~2% in reality). Similar results were found in real life examples of mammograms with practicing gynecologists, in which the majority incorrectly reported a positive test was >80% likely to be a true positive (the correct answer was only 7%). Our group and others have found, when asked about the benefits of common treatments for hypertension, myocardial infarction and stroke prevention, physicians overestimate the benefits of treatments, with less than 25% accurately identifying the absolute benefit of treatment (and many estimating an effect 2-10 times larger than reality). These misunderstandings lead to overdiagnosis, overtreatment and overuse, which may account for up to one third of medical care services. The benefits of medical care could be achieved with less patient harm and more satisfaction if test interpretation and decision-making were improved. Diagnostic probabilities underlie nearly all physician testing and treatment decisions. Bayesian reasoning is thought to be the most rational way to assess this. One application of Bayesian reasoning is in diagnosis. Given an initial assessment of the likelihood of a disease and clinical test results, Bayesian reasoning is the mathematically valid method to quantify the probability that the disease is truly present. Psychological techniques for online training in Bayesian reasoning or displaying the results of such reasoning in visual aids has improved performance on physician testing but we know of no interventions that have applied training or visual aids to improve clinician ability to interpret tests or understand treatment effects for actual patients. To reach our overall goal of reducing harms of medical care while maintaining benefits, we propose 3 objectives:1) explore physician factors associated with accurate Bayesian reasoning, 2) develop educational training and visual aids to improve physician understanding of tests and treatment, and 3) pilot these tools in a stepped wedge cluster trial. The PI is well suited for this innovative research based on a non-traditional background in psychology, epidemiology, quality improvement and clinical medicine and has assembled experts in evidence based medicine, visual presentation, qualitative and quantitative research methods. This project has the potential to transform clinical medicine, making it more evidence based with more patient involvement while improving patient outcomes and healthcare costs."
"9444092","Project summary Burden of acute respiratory infections (ARI) and associated viral respiratory pathogens is not well documented in India. Previous studies have identified respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and influenza as among the common viruses involved in respiratory infection. Vaccination is among most effective strategies for prevention of influenza virus infection and its severe complications. However there are economic, operational as well as attitudinal barriers for adoption of Influenza vaccination. This calls for an evidence based concerted advocacy which is in keeping with the disease burden and epidemiology of influenza in India. Therefore, this project tries to assess the burden of ARI and associated respiratory pathogens among elderly population, and attempts to uncover excess influenza related mortality in India using modeling techniques. It also seeks to assess attitude of priority populations viz. elderly individuals and health care workers regarding influenza vaccination at multiple sites in different regions of the country. Such an approach towards introduction of vaccine for priority populations especially elderly is most likely to succeed. A community cohort of elderly (over 60 year) population will be recruited from four sites from different regions of the country for a two-year follow-up. By way of weekly visits, information on incident cases of ARIs will be collected. ARI cases will be classified into acute upper (AURI) or lower respiratory infection (ALRI). Naso- and oro-pharyngeal swabs will be collected from all cases of ALRI and a sub-sample of AURI, and age and sex matched neighborhood controls for testing for influenza and other respiratory viral pathogens. Incidence of ARI, both total and pathogen specific, as well as outpatient visit and hospitalization rates will be estimated from the cohort. Direct and indirect cost of influenza related respiratory illness will be ascertained from patients recruited from identified hospitals. Modeling techniques using virological and mortality data at national level will be used to generate estimates for influenza related mortality. One fifty to two hundred healthcare workers from the hospitals recruited for earlier study and 250 subjects from elderly cohort from each site will be recruited to assess their attitude and practices regarding influenza vaccination using standardized questionnaire."
"9456205","ABSTRACT  Digital subtraction angiography (DSA) is a proven tool for the diagnosis and treatment of cerebral and peripheral vascular diseases, providing 2D and 3D images of complex vascular anatomy without background anatomic clutter. Still, there are classes of interventional procedures in the thorax and abdomen for which DSA is challenging and often not performed, even though vessels of interest may be obscured by anatomic background. In these body regions, motion of background tissues can be difficult to fully control, leading to subtraction artifacts in DSA images which can easily be as large as the vessel signal itself. The overall goal of this project is to eliminate these limitations through the development of mask-free dual-energy DSA. The clinical application addressed is the interventional treatment of pulmonary embolism, which involves both complex 3D pulmonary artery anatomy and challenging catheter device guidance tasks. In the U.S., pulmonary embolism accounts for as many as 100,000 annual deaths and is a growing cause for hospitalization. Catheter-based treatments using x-ray image guidance are being adopted at most centers for pulmonary embolism patients, yet current imaging techniques remain firmly rooted in 2D non-subtracted methods. Dual-energy DSA (DESA) based on fast kV-switching enables the generation of subtraction images from high and low energy projections which are acquired very close in time, and eliminates the traditional mask phase entirely. We hypothesize that DESA will be insensitive to motion of background tissue when compared to conventional time-subtracted DSA, and additionally, DESA will eliminate background clutter present in non-subtracted angiography. The specific aims are to i) implement a fast kV-switching C-arm prototype and develop dual-energy techniques, ii) evaluate the performance of 2D DESA in phantoms, and iii) evaluate 3D DESA in phantoms and in an animal model of pulmonary embolism. Successful completion will establish a new interventional imaging technique for procedures which traditionally suffer from DSA subtraction artifacts. Beyond the pulmonary application, we anticipate these techniques will be extendable to interventions in the abdomen, the head, and in peripheral procedures."
"9482382","Abstract The Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 1 (HIV-1, hereafter referred to as HIV) currently infects ~37 million people worldwide, and the number of infected individuals continues to rise. In the absence of a cure, antiretroviral therapy (ART) represents the primary treatment option, as it slows disease progression, and limits new infections. Integrase (IN) Strand Transfer Inhibitors (INSTIs) are a class of ART that block integration of viral DNA into host chromosomes, a process that is mediated by the viral IN enzyme, which assembles into oligomeric nucleoprotein complexes on the ends of viral DNA, termed ?intasomes?. INSTIs selectively target intasomes and represent first-line therapies in the clinic. However, the emergence of IN variants resistant to INSTIs is a major clinical problem. Structural biology approaches can decipher the molecular mechanisms underlying drug action and resistance, providing useful information for rationally improving current therapies. In this proposal, approaches centered around revolutionary advances in cryo-electron microscopy for structural studies will be used to understand how INSTIs interact with their natural drug target, the HIV intasome, as well as mechanisms by which resistance to these drugs emerges.  The proposed aims will address several major themes. Aim 1 will define the mechanisms of action of clinical and developmental INSTIs in the context of HIV intasomes. Procedures used to perform high-resolution structural studies of INSTI-bound complexes by cryo-EM will then be adopted to decipher novel, clinically relevant mechanisms of drug resistance that arise in response to INSTI treatment. This work will be complemented using biochemical and virology assays designed to dissect key interactions between HIV intasomes and INSTIs and to validate structural findings. Aim 2 will extend these findings to define INSTI mechanism of action in the presence of biologically relevant cellular factors, including methylated mononucleosomes (mMNs; the natural target for HIV integration) and lens epithelium-derived growth factor (LEDGF). Aim 2 will therefore define the biochemical and structural mechanisms by which INSTIs interact with and inhibit IN catalytic activity in the context of the intasome-LEDGF-mMN complex, thereby elucidating how INSTIs function in infected cells and their precise stage of activity.  In addition to providing the first structural information for INSTI interactions with their natural drug target in the presence of relevant cellular factors, this work will: 1) elucidate how mutations within the IN active site disrupt drug binding, 2) define the precise stage and mechanism of action of this important class of drugs in a cellular context, and 3) provide blueprints for the rational improvement of future INSTIs. !"
"9384510","Project Summary/Abstract Pharmacogenomics prescribing guidance, currently provided for more than 150 drug-gene pairs, is improving drug efficacy and reducing adverse drug reactions for millions of Americans. However, much of this current guidance is more relevant to Caucasians than minority patient populations. It has long been understood that racial differences regarding the frequencies of genetic polymorphisms exist, but more recent investigations are demonstrating that significant racial differences exist also regarding the effects resulting from those genetic polymorphisms. This has set the stage for significant racial disparities in Pharmacogenomics and Precision Medicine, and such disparities continue to grow as pharmacogenomics research is largely conducted in patient populations that are predominantly or exclusively Caucasian. To reduce this disparity the National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities (NIMHD) funds investigator-initiated research on health disparities, and one focus is pharmacogenomic studies to determine medication response and optimal dosing in health disparity populations. Candidate-gene studies in minority health populations, such as the proposed research in this grant application, are indicated not only for the translation of newly discovered polymorphisms but also to ensure that clinical guidance regarding pharmacogenomics testing has relevance for minority patients. Our previous work uncovered a common functional genetic polymorphism, CYP3A4*22, to be associated with significantly higher concentrations (nearly 3-fold increase) of simvastatin in African Americans but not in Caucasians. Importantly, simvastatin is one of the most commonly prescribed medications, and greater systemic exposure to simvastatin increases the likelihood of simvastatin-induced myopathy. Hundreds of thousands of the approximate 10 million African Americans prescribed simvastatin on an annual basis are carriers of at least one copy of the CYP3A4*22 polymorphism and therefore are likely at a significantly increased risk of simvastatin-induced myopathy. This increased risk could potentially be readily mitigated by a prescribed lower dose, alternate statin type or alternate lipid-lowering strategy. The basic science, translational and clinical investigations proposed in this grant provide the evidence needed to potentially translate this into clinical practice. Specifically, in vitro molecular genetics studies of liver tissue (predominant site of CYP3A4 metabolism) will be performed to better characterize the extent and mechanisms underlying the decrease of CYP3A4 metabolism associated with CYP3A4*22 in African Americans as well as to potentially elucidate any additional polymorphisms in CYP3A4 relevant to African Americans. The proposed clinical investigation will compare daily simvastatin systemic exposure in African American CYP3A4*22 carriers and non-carriers, providing better quantification of the increased simvastatin exposure of muscle and better estimation of the resulting increase in risk of simvastatin myopathy. Importantly, this work can be extended to future studies of other medications dependent on CYP3A4 metabolism. This holds substantial promise because CYP3A4 is responsible for the metabolism of more than half of the most commonly used medications in the United States. In summary, the research proposed in the study has significant potential for advancing Pharmacogenomics and Personalized Health Care in African Americans - an important minority health and health disparity patient population in the United States."
"9421423","Effects of Informal Care for persons with Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias  The current debate about how best to meet the growing demand for patient-centered, high-quality long- term care for persons with ADRD in the least restrictive setting possible has centered almost solely on the direct and indirect costs of each type of care. A crucial missing piece is a comparison of the benefits. While receiving informal care may seem intuitively appealing, we currently know surprisingly little about the implications of this choice for outcomes of the individuals receiving the care.  Our study would be the first to measure the causal impact of receiving informal versus formal long-term care on key and multi-faceted outcomes for the care recipient, primarily using the Health and Retirement Study, a nationally-representative dataset of Americans age 50+. Our analysis would include all individuals receiving long-term care, as well as a sub-sample of individuals living with ADRD, since informal care costs account for approximately half the total costs of the disease. Our health outcomes include a rich set of self-reported physical, mental, emotional, and social health measures, as well as self-reported and administrative health care utilization measures. In order to estimate the causal impact of formal and informal care, we employ instrumental variable techniques and a set of instruments that have been successfully used to predict informal care receipt in previous work using the same dataset. In addition, we propose new and promising instruments, including the supply of formal care available in the market. Finally, our study is the first to take a comprehensive look at all forms of formal care, including the plethora of private-pay residential care options. To do so, this research brings together the Area Health Resource Files (AHRF) and the NIC-MAP database, the industry's premiere dataset concerning the long-term care market.  Using this approach, our study proposes to address the following specific aims: to describe comprehensively an expanded profile of the supply of publicly and privately financed formal care in local markets and its correlation with informal care, and to quantify the difference in care recipient outcomes caused by receiving informal versus formal care. This proposal will inform the policy tradeoffs between supporting informal care providers and expanding publicly financed formal care options."

"9393800","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death in the United States. Atherosclerosis, the major cause of CVD, is an inflammatory disease resulting from the accumulation of cholesterol in plaque along the artery walls. High density lipoprotein (HDL) protects against CVD, as it carries peripheral cholesterol to the liver for biliary excretion in a process known as reverse cholesterol transport (RCT). Efficient RCT and the selective uptake of cholesteryl esters (CE) from HDL into cells require interactions between HDL and its high affinity receptor, scavenger receptor-BI (SR-BI). The presence of SR-BI dimers and higher-order oligomers is important for facilitating the selective uptake of HDL-CE; however, the mechanisms that drive oligomerization remain unknown. Both the N-terminal and C-terminal transmembrane domains (N-TMD and C-TMD, respectively) of SR-BI contain putative dimerization motifs that, when disrupted, impair SR-BI dimerization as well as cholesterol transport functions. Recently, our lab used NMR techniques to solve the high-resolution 3D structure of a peptide of SR-BI (residues 405-475) that spans the C-TMD, as well as a leucine zipper dimerization motif. Using this structure to our full advantage, we have designed experiments in this fellowship application to test the hypothesis that SR-BI oligomerization and flexibility between the transmembrane domains of neighboring SR-BI monomers are essential for efficient RCT. In Aim 1, we will test the importance of key structural features of SR-BI?s C-TMD on cholesterol transport functions of SR-BI. In Aim 1.1, we will study the significance of a proline kink within the C-TMD, while in Aim 1.2, we will examine the effects of reduced flexibility between C-TMDs of SR-BI monomers using a ?locked dimer? approach. In Aim 1.3, we will determine the physiological relevance of oligomerization by testing the leucine zipper SR-BI mutant in an in vivo model of RCT. In Aim 2, we will determine the NMR structure of SR-BI?s N-TMD in order to identify structural features of this domain that may be functionally relevant (Aim 2.1). Then, armed with NMR structures of both transmembrane domains, we will map the dimer interface(s) that support SR-BI oligomerization between the C-TMDs and/or N-TMDs using paramagnetic relaxation enhancement strategies in Aim 2.2. These studies will help us to better understand how SR-BI/HDL interactions, together with SR-BI oligomerization, promote efficient RCT and improve net cholesterol excretion. Our findings will hopefully lead to the design of a new class of therapeutics directed at improving clearance of plasma cholesterol and preventing atherosclerosis."
"9344292","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT: HIV viral load (VL) monitoring is a crucial component of the ongoing scale-up of antiretroviral therapy (ART) in Sub-Saharan Africa. Uganda recently launched a nationwide VL testing system; however, significant implementation gaps have emerged in three critical areas: (1) inadequate VL ordering, (2) slow generation and reporting of VL results, and (3) suboptimal interpretation of VL results for adherence counseling. Additionally, significant disparities exist in sub-populations at high-risk of virologic failure including (1) pregnant women, (2) children and adolescents, (3) persons whose last VL was detectable, and (4) persons missing a VL test. To address the implementation gaps on how best to improve VL ordering, speed up VL turnaround time, and improve VL counseling, we propose a comparative effectiveness, clinic-level cluster randomized trial of a targeted, multi-component intervention package called ?RAPID-VL? among 1,200 high-risk and non-high-risk patients in 20 PEPFAR-supported ART clinics in southwest Uganda. Anchored in the PRECEDE implementation science framework, ?RAPID-VL? consists of (1) a VL ordering flowsheet to increase correct VL ordering, coupled with a performance feedback system to reinforce best practices, (2) a point-of-care VL machine at a hub near the clinics that will speed up the generation and delivery of VL results to clinicians, and (3) a VL counseling package that teaches clinicians an efficient method for counseling patients on VL results. Aim 1: Determine the comparative effectiveness of the RAPID-VL intervention on VL ordering and VL turnaround time: We will randomize HIV clinics to RAPID-VL vs. standard VL procedures (n=10 clinics each, 60 patients/clinic, comprised of 20 non-high risk patients plus 10 high risk patients in each of 4 categories), and will compare (1) guideline-indicated VL ordering, (2) VL turnaround time, (3) VL suppression, (4) VL re- suppression after a detectable result, and (5) switching to 2nd line ART. Aim 2: Identify facilitators and barriers to implementation, as well as perceived utility of RAPID-VL from both patient and clinician perspectives. We will measure fidelity to each RAPID-VL component via in-clinic observations and training assessments. We will perform qualitative interviews of 20 clinicians and 40 patients to capture facilitators, barriers, acceptability and sustainability of RAPID-VL and examine its perceived utility.  Aim 3: Determine the costs, cost-effectiveness, and incremental gain costs of RAPID-VL: We will conduct micro-costing analyses of key cost inputs including training, clinician effort, point-of-care VL machinery, and transportation costs. We will compare these to costs of the current standard of care DBS-based system on unit cost and ?cost-per-added success.? We will also estimate cost per disability-adjusted life year (DALY) averted for RAPID-VL. Our overall objective is to rigorously test a novel intervention to improve VL operations in PEPFAR- supported Ugandan HIV clinics. Our long-term goal is to maximize the public health impact of ART by optimizing processes for VL testing. This will improve health, lower mortality, and accelerate ART expansion.    "
"9483034","Precision oncology places an increased demand on cancer diagnostics to characterize tumors at the time of diagnosis. Tissue diagnostics for precision oncology increasingly rely on multi-valent assays to characterize cancer biology and identify therapeutic targets. The power of molecular imaging for cancer diagnosis has been well demonstrated by [18F]fluorodexoyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG PET/CT), widely used in clinical oncology. PET tracers targeted to facets of tumor biology now enable multi-valent molecular imaging to identify therapeutic targets. Early studies show that combined tracer studies, commonly FDG plus a target- specific tracer, are highly predictive of tumor response to targeted therapy. However, emissions from different PET tracers are indistinguishable to a PET scanner, requiring separate imaging sessions on separate days for multiple 18F-based tracers (~ 2 hour half-life) in the same patient. This limits the clinical practicality of multi-tracer PET, and fails to exploit the full power of multi-tracer PET to quantify tumor in vivo biology and biologic heterogeneity for highly variable process such as cancer metabolism. We will overcome this limitation by taking advantage of recent developments in volumetric PET scanners, fast reconstruction, and 4D image analysis methods from our laboratories to develop Multi-Tracer Volumetric PET (MTV-PET) to generate multi-valent, quantitative biologic parametric images for two or more tracers in a single session to guide precision oncology and translational cancer biology research. As such, our proposed technology development project addresses a need, described under Priority Area B for ?new capabilities for advancing precise clinical diagnosis of cancer patients?. Using methods developed in our laboratories, we now propose to integrate and enhance these methodologies to develop and validate Multi-Tracer Volumetric PET (MTV-PET) to generate quantitative biologic parametric images for two or more tracers in a single session. We will develop and test this approach for simultaneous glucose and glutamine metabolism imaging, with the goal of guiding metabolism-targeted therapy such as inhibitors of glutaminase (GLS) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). The project will focus on the technology developments (largely computational) that enable multi-tracer imaging. Ongoing and separately funded work on clinical studies will acquire data from two separate imaging PET sessions using current technology and will provide data for method development. We will first optimize tracer dose timing, image reconstruction, and image time binning for dual tracer MTV-PET (Aim 1), followed by implementation and technical validation of image analysis using a mixture analysis approach (Aim 2). This will set the stage for technical validation of MTV-PET (Aim 3) and an exploratory aim (Aim 4) testing image analytics based on machine learning. Successful completion of our technology development will yield a new method for multi-tracer PET that would change the landscape for cancer imaging diagnostic biomarker and precision oncology research, consistent with goals of RFA-CA-17-023 Priority Area B."
"9321614","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): ALS affects people in middle to late ages, during a time of life where it is common to suffer from more than one health problem, yet there is little understanding of the effect of chronic medical conditions and medication use on susceptibility to ALS. There is mounting concern and recent evidence that certain medical conditions and medications are associated with an increased risk of developing ALS, while other conditions and medications appear to be inversely associated with ALS risk. We propose to investigate the role of hyperlipidemia, diabetes, autoimmune diseases, as well as the drugs used to treat these disorders, as both risk and prognostic factors for ALS. This study has three specific aims: Aim 1, to investigate the association between antecedent medical conditions and the risk of developing ALS; Aim 2, to examine the relationship between certain classes of medication and the risk of developing ALS; and Aim 3, to determine whether medical conditions or medications present at diagnosis of ALS adversely or positively affect survival with ALS. We will assemble a retrospective cohort of Medicare beneficiaries who were continuously enrolled in fee-for-service Medicare (Parts A, B and D) during the years 2006 through 2014. To address aims 1 and 2, we will conduct a nested case-control study to identify newly diagnosed (incident) patients with ALS in this cohort between 2008 and 2014 using a modified version of the case definition algorithm used by the National ALS Registry. We expect to identify 11,000 incident ALS cases. Using incidence density sampling, ten age- and sex-matched controls will be randomly chosen for each case from among Medicare beneficiaries who entered the Medicare cohort in the same year as the case, but had who had no codes for ALS, MND or closely related conditions prior to their matched cases' diagnosis dates. We will use Medicare inpatient, outpatient, and laboratory health claims to document the occurrence of metabolic, cardiovascular, and autoimmune conditions among the study subjects both before and after the diagnosis of ALS. The availability of Part D (pharmaceutical) claims for Medicare beneficiaries from 2006 onward will provide the opportunity to examine the association of commonly used medications with the risk and prognosis of ALS. We will use conditional logistic regression analyses to identify premorbid medical conditions and medications associated with the risk of developing ALS. To address specific aim 3, we will link the data from our incident ALS case group to mortality data and conduct survival analyses to determine whether antecedent medical conditions and medications present at diagnosis are associated with either shortened or prolonged survival with ALS. We will use survival analysis to determine whether there is an association between these conditions/medications and survival with ALS. This study will contribute significantly to the understanding of the role that metabolic factors, hyperlipidemia, cardiovascular disease and autoimmunity play in the etiology and prognosis of ALS, and could lead to the development of new preventive or therapeutic interventions to prolong survival in ALS patients."
"9449723","Project Summary/Abstract While small molecule inhibitors have made an impact in human diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), immunotherapy, specifically using anti-CD20 based approaches, has had the most profound effect on treatment strategies and long-term outcomes. Despite this progress, up to 40% of patients will ultimately succumb to their disease. Furthermore, even when treatment is successful, cytotoxic chemotherapy carries a high risk of long- term morbidities that impact quality of life. The recent success of targeted therapies and immune checkpoint inhibitors in the setting of lymphoma demonstrates the potential for additional progress in long-term disease control of DLBCL, with less toxicity. The molecular and genetic phenotype of canine DLBCL has been studied and it often resembles the activated B cell (ABC) category typically associated with aggressive DLBCL in people. Moreover, there is now substantial data that specific genetic changes and pathway aberrations are conserved across dogs and people with DLBCL supporting the notion that the canine disease can be used as a relevant spontaneous large animal model of the human counterpart. Toward this end, the purpose of this proposal is to use dogs with spontaneous naïve DLBCL to rapidly evaluate rational small molecule/immunotherapy combination approaches, with the ultimate goal of identifying the most effective combination to move forward in human patients with DLBCL. Specifically, we hypothesize that optimal combinations of anti-CD20, anti- PD1, XPO1 inhibition, NAMPT/PAK4 and PI3Kdelta inhibition will have better outcomes than doxorubicin based chemotherapy, resulting in a ?chemo-free? blueprint for future human trials. Using an adaptive mini-pilot trial approach, those combinations deemed antagonistic and/or associated with unacceptable adverse events can be rapidly removed from consideration, while those with clear therapeutic promise can be most effectively studied in the front-line setting and enhanced. We will accomplish this by first determining the optimal chemo-free regimen with small molecule/ anti-CD20 combinations, then identifying the optimal chemo-free regimen with small molecule/anti-PD1 combinations and finally, by evaluating a frontline chemo-free novel combination regimen in canine DLBCL to demonstrate superiority to standard R-CHOP-based chemotherapy. Additionally, we will interrogate correlative biomarkers based on RNA sequencing of tumor samples obtained from dogs enrolled into the prospective trials and develop signatures that can be used to predict not only response to therapy, but more importantly long-term progression-free survival. Together, the data generated from this proposal will create a framework for effectively leveraging information gained from integrated immunotherapeutic trials in canine patients with DLBCL to develop chemo-free strategies that ultimately improve human outcomes."
"9436149","Project Summary Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is a genetic disorder that often causes neurologic pathology such as epilepsy, developmental disability, or neuropsychiatric disease. TSC is caused by heterozygous, inactivating mutations in the TSC1 or TSC2 genes that encode protein binding partners hamartin and tuberin. Dimerized hamartin and tuberin negatively regulate mTORC1, the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1. In response to anabolic signals, activated mTORC1 stimulates protein synthesis, cell growth and cell cycle progression. The pathogenesis of TSC is largely due to constitutive mTORC1 activation and consequent cellular anabolism. Despite advances in our knowledge about the molecular basis of TSC, the downstream events causing TSC pathology remain unclear. Using an unbiased, global metabolomic profiling approach, we assayed hippocampal tissue from a well-characterized mouse model of TSC in which the Tsc2 gene is conditionally disrupted in radial glial precursor cells (Tsc2-RG). These and subsequent data revealed an upregulation of the polyamine putrescine and increase in ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) activity, the rate limiting enzyme in polyamine synthesis, in Tsc2-RG mutants. Polyamines are essential for cell proliferation and survival and evidence suggests an interaction between polyamines and mTORC signaling. In this proposal, we will determine if directly reducing ODC activity ameliorates TSC-associated neuropathology and dampens mTORC signaling in mice. We will use complementary genetic and pharmacological approaches to reduce ODC activity and concomitant putrescine levels and polyamine flux. We propose to generate Tsc2-RG; Odc+/- compound mutants and determine if Odc haploinsufficiency affects (1) ODC activity and polyamine levels in brain lysates; (2) markers of neuropathology typical of TSC; and (3) levels of TSC/mTORC1 signaling proteins. Similarly, we will treat Tsc2-RG and control mice from postnatal days 1-21 with the ODC inhibitor difluoromethylornithine (DFMO) and determine its effects on these same phenotypic parameters. This project is expected to expand our understanding of the molecular basis of TSC by establishing a novel function for polyamines in determining TSC pathology. Additionally, these studies may define novel targets for TSC therapeutics."
"9420418","Abstract: Our brain is a complex network with multiple levels of organization in white matter (WM) and gray matter (GM). The axonal and dendritic organizations of local GM tissue form one of the structural bases of normal brain functions. In addition, recent histopathology evidence has consistently demonstrated alterations in GM architectures in several neurological diseases, e.g., the Alzheimer's disease, multiple sclerosis, autism and epilepsy. Capturing these microstructural changes using non-invasive imaging techniques is extremely important but has not been achieved. It is therefore critical to develop the next generation imaging technologies that can visualize complex microstructural organizations in human cortical and subcortical GM. Diffusion MRI is the main technique for non-invasive mapping of WM tracts and a key component of the human connectome project. However, its low spatial resolution and the distinct organization of GM microstructures have been the major barriers for this technique to be used for characterization of GM micro-architectures and their abnormalities. We propose to develop an ultra-high-resolution diffusion MRI technique for improved human GM microarchitecture characterization at a 0.5 x 0.5 x 0.5 mm3 or finer resolution. This represents a 64- fold reduction in individual pixel volume from the status quo (2 mm isotropic), a dramatic improvement in spatial resolution, and fits the requirement of RFA-EB-17-001. In this application, we first demonstrate that the current state-of-the-art clinical MRI systems meet the theoretical SNR limit necessary to support imaging at such a high resolution for at least the cortical GM region. We then demonstrate the feasibility of using selective excitation to significantly shorten the acquisition of three- dimensional (3D) high-resolution diffusion MRI data. This will be further aided by a fast 3D imaging sequence that combines compressed sensing and parallel imaging. Altogether, we expect to acquire ultra-high-resolution diffusion MRI data from local GM regions at approximately 0.5 mm isotropic resolution within 20 minutes and use it to map the structural organization of the human cortex and hippocampus (Aim 1). We will integrate the high-resolution local GM data with whole-brain diffusion MRI data at 2 mm resolution and generate a group- average atlas of the hippocampus and temporal lobe based on ultra-high-resolution diffusion MRI data from 20 healthy volunteers (Aim 2). The proposed approach promises to provide an important set of tools for neuroscientists and clinicians to investigate structural organizations and connectivity of human GM."
"9554327","PROJECT SUMMARY In this SBIR Phase I proposal, we aim to develop a retinal imaging based automated screening system to identify individuals at an early or intermediate stage of age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and thus enable treatment to prevent late AMD. Late AMD, in the dry or wet form, is the leading cause of vision loss in the developed countries. The Age-Related Eye Disease Study (AREDS) showed that specific antioxidant vitamin supplementation reduces the risk of progression from intermediate stages to late AMD and maintains visual acuity in approximately 25% of patients. Indeed, there is no present treatment for dry advanced AMD. While treatment of wet AMD with Intraocular injections can be effective in maintaining vision, such treatments are costly, and may be associated with significant cardiovascular risks, or even progression of dry AMD. While the direct impact of AMD is vision loss, it has other indirect complications such as depression, social dependency and risk of fall and injury. Hence, it is critical to identify patients at the earlier stages. Unfortunately, there is no effective, automated large scale screening tool to accomplish this, and the patients themselves may be asymptomatic. The goal of this proposal is to provide such a tool. The current few screening systems are mainly semi-automatic and rely on color fundus (CF) photography to identify drusen, the classic lesions of early AMD. However, no screening system captures Reticular Pseudo Drusen (RPD), a recently found and common early AMD lesion that carries an even worse prognosis for late AMD than ordinary drusen. Therefore, we will utilize both CF photography for drusen and high contrast Red-free (RF) imaging for RPD detection in a multimodal automatic screening tool to detect both forms of early AMD with high accuracy. Furthermore, lack of ophthalmologists in underserved areas may preclude the timely detection of early AMD. Therefore, we will next incorporate our screening tool in a telemedicine platform that can be deployed in such underserved areas to identify patients with AMD for referral to an ophthalmologist. In the current proposal, we will develop and validate the necessary algorithms to demonstrate that an automated screening system for early/intermediate AMD is feasible. In our Phase II SBIR proposal we will develop and test the complete system along with CF and RF retinal image capture devices that can be suitable for use of our system in a telemedicine platform."
"9419650","The main goal of this CounterACT R21 (exploratory) project is to determine the therapeutic potential of epigenetic therapy in attenuating subchronic and long-term neurological effects from acute organophosphate pesticide and nerve agent (OPNA) exposure. Although the acute lethal effects of OPNAs are well described, non- lethal short- and long-term effects remain unclear. Immediately after exposure, nerve agent intoxication leads to a progression from miosis to seizures and status epilepticus, and then to death due to respiratory failure. If one survives this cholinergic crisis, there is usually damage to the brain and chronic neurological dysfunction. However, there are no treatment options available to prevent or mitigate these devastating long-term effects of OPNAs. A variety of agents targeting excitotoxicity, oxidation, and inflammation have been proposed, but epigenetic agents are not widely studied in OPNAs. Epigenetics refers to specific changes in gene expression mediated by chromatin-based mechanisms in response to environmental cues. In this project, we seek to identify an epigenetic intervention to limit long-term effects following OPNAs, with the ultimate goal of identifying a promising drug for common neuroprotection. The histone deacetylation (HDAC) pathway represents a logical target for such intervention, because HDACs regulate specific physiological functions in the brain. The proposed epigenetic therapy is based on the hypothesis that acute OPNA neurotoxicity imparts long-lasting activation of the epigenetically- regulated HDAC pathway and therefore, selective HDAC inhibition prevents long-term neurodegeneration and neurological dysfunction. We will test this hypothesis by utilizing two FDA-approved drugs: (Aim 1) To determine whether HDAC inhibitors sodium butyrate and vorinostat prevents or attenuates long-term neurodegeneration and neurological dysfunction following acute DFP exposure in rats; and (Aim 2) To determine whether HDAC inhibitors sodium butyrate and vorinostat prevents or attenuates long-term neurodegeneration and neurological dysfunction following acute soman exposure in rats. Test drugs will be tested as per the NIH rigor criteria in a dose-related design in male and females for 2 weeks and behavior/neuropathology will be checked at 3 months post-exposure. The project will be implemented as per the ?go/no-go? milestones plan. Two primary outcome measures will be addressed for therapy effectiveness: (i) chronic neuroprotectant efficacy; and (ii) prevention of neurological and behavioral deficits. The primary measures of neuroprotection include extent of neurodegeneration, neuroinflammation, neurogenesis, and mossy fiber sprouting. Key neurological outcomes include epileptic seizures, memory deficits, depression, anxiety behavior, and neurological/motor deficits. The outcome of this project will provide ?proof-of-efficacy? of a ground-breaking therapy with two FDA-approved drugs with promising potential to limit long-term effects of OPNAs in humans. Thus, the overall impact of the outcome is enormous for civilians, especially in developing a post-exposure medical countermeasure for chemical agents."
"9409931","iFACS: Imaging Florescence Activated Cell Sorter to sort cells based on images NanoCellect Biomedical, Inc. RESEARCH & RELATED Other Project Information 7. PROJECT SUMMARY Advances in reagents (e.g. CRiSPR) and analytical tools (e.g. flow cytometers) have improved the ability to alter and characterize cellular phenotypes. Ultimately, many key applications in biomedicine require efficient and accurate isolation of cell populations according to features contained in high content images. Unfortunately, microscopic laser microdissection systems have a throughput that is too slow to be practical in many applications; while the existing flow cytometers that can sort cells (fluorescence-activated cell sorters or FACS) provide only size, internal complexity, and fluorescence intensity information and lack the rich data of imaging. Another critical limitation is that the existing flow cytometers that can image, cannot sort cells. NanoCellect has made a highly affordable FACS to increase access to this important high-throughput tool for cell analysis. Here we propose to enhance our existing low-cost FACS with the ability to image cells and sort them based on image features. This will allow users to pursue new strategies in drug screening and mechanism of action research; as well as work with suspension cell lines, such as those that dominate the recent advances in immuno-oncology. In Phase I research, we have demonstrated the world's first imaging flow cytometer with cell sorting capabilities (iFACS) in a unique design of space-time coding with an optical spatial filter. The approach adds negligible cost to the system for the desirable features of cell imaging and sorting. To fully realize the enormous potential of the design and to meet the demands for most applications, in Phase II we will develop high-throughput image-based cell sorting with innovative image-guided gating schemes supported by machine learning and interactive user/machine interface. Essentially, image-based flow cytometry gating uses similar cell isolation criteria as the techniques of laser capture microdissection or cell aspiration to isolate cells of interest, with 10,000X throughput improvements to 1000+ cells per second. We envision such unique capabilities will become common, default features for tomorrow's users as the tool becomes as intuitive and ubiquitous as fluorescent microscopy. The proposed iFACS will be transformative and benefit numerous biomedical applications, such as isolation of cells based on organelle translocation, cell cycle analyses, detection and counting of phagocytosed particles, and protein co-localization, to name just a few."
"9354189","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Heart transplant is the gold standard therapy for patients with end-stage heart failure, with more than 5,000 transplants performed worldwide annually. Primary graft dysfunction (PGD) represents the most common cause of early mortality after cardiac transplantation, accounting for up to 40% of deaths occurring in the first thirty postoperative days. It represents a significant barrier to expansion of cardiac transplantation as definitive therapy for patients with end-stage heart failure. Despite its clinical impact, significnt gaps remain in our understanding of PGD. Factors related to the donor, the transplant procedure itself, and systemic recipient factors potentially contribute to the pathogenesis of PGD. However, PGD is not adequately predicted by donor factors, pre-transplant organ function, or compatibility. Importantly, cardiac allografts objectively considered to be of margina status by these metrics do not demonstrate an increased rate of PGD. Emerging evidence suggests a fundamental role for mitochondrial dysfunction in PGD, specifically as a result of oxidative stress. Furthermore, oxidative stress-induced mitochondrial injury likely further stimulates pro-inflammatory signaling, thus contributing to dysfunction in aggregate with an augmented alloimmune response.  Our central hypothesis is that mitochondrial injury and subsequent immune consequences of mitochondrial dysfunction are critical in development of the PGD phenotype. The proposed studies will investigate the fundamental injury processes underlying PGD following cardiac transplantation and subsequent immune consequences that may contribute to graft dysfunction. The goal of these studies is to interrogate the fundamental injury processes and subsequent immune consequences that contribute to graft dysfunction. These studies will inform the design of new strategies to facilitate improved prediction, prevention, and management of PGD."
"9348610","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Accountable care organizations (ACOs) are a recent health reform that seeks to provide higher quality care at lower cost. Since starting in 2012, Medicare ACOs already cover more than 5 million patients. In ACOs, clinicians and/or hospitals contract with payers to share accountability for patients' health outcomes and expenditures. Effectively engaging patients in ACOs will be critical to their success. Using a patient centered outcomes research (PCOR) engagement framework, this project proposes a novel investigation of system- level patient engagement, defined as integrating patients' preferences, values, and priorities into the design and governance of health care organizations. Medicare regulations require a beneficiary representative on ACO leadership boards as part of system-level engagement. Whether this effectively represents all ACO patients remains unknown, and ACOs have flexibility to develop novel methods. This proposal integrates qualitative and quantitative research to elicit patient preferences about system-level engagement in order to fill this knowledge gap and design a new patient engagement intervention. Working within Medicare ACOs led by academic medical centers, it will accomplish four aims: AIM1 will define a taxonomy of existing engagement strategies in use by ACOs and collect rich qualitative data about these strategies (e.g., regarding successes and challenges) from ACO leaders. AIM2 will elicit beneficiary representatives' perceptions of system-level engagement. The information gained from AIMS1-2 will be disseminated to assist ACOs' ongoing development of system-level engagement methods. It will also inform AIM3, which will elicit patients' expressed preferences regarding system-level engagement and assess their knowledge and attitudes toward ACOs via an in-depth study of 5 urban ACOs. Information from AIMS1-3 will be used to design a novel system-level engagement strategy and evaluate its feasibility in AIM4. The candidate is an Assistant Professor at Johns Hopkins in the Division of General Internal Medicine (GIM) and the Berman Institute of Bioethics. His long-term career goal is to become an independent clinician investigator whose innovative PCOR enhances patients' experiences of care, improves health outcomes, and lowers costs through ethically-designed, meaningful patient engagement. He has a unique background as a practicing internist with PhD training in philosophy who in 2013 completed a joint fellowship in GIM and bioethics and health policy. In the short-term, he seeks additional training necessary for PCOR, focusing on advanced qualitative methods, survey design, and the theory and practice of patient engagement. His career development plan meets his unique training needs via didactic courses at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, practical research experience, and a strong multi-disciplinary mentorship team comprising expertise in PCOR, patient engagement, health system reform, and ACOs. The mentorship team includes Drs. Jeremy Sugarman, Albert Wu, Ruth Faden, Gerard Anderson, and Scott Berkowitz. The institutional environment for the project includes several institutes and centers at Johns Hopkins. First is the Johns Hopkins Berman Institute of Bioethics (BI), an internationally recognized leader in empirical research on the ethics of medicine, public health, and health policy. Recent emphases of BI research include a Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI) funded evaluation of stakeholder views of comparative effectiveness research (CER) and an effort at engaging stakeholders in the move toward Learning Health Systems (both under Ruth Faden), as well as research eliciting stakeholder views within the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Health Care Systems Research Collaboratory (under Jeremy Sugarman). Second is the Division of GIM, which supports over 90 faculty members with diverse research interests. GIM is an exceptionally active division with a track record of successfully training junior faculty. It includes a GIM Methods Core that provides research consulting services, such as study design and statistical analysis. Third is the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health (JHBSPH), an international leader in public health research and education. JHBSPH is home to the Center for Health Services and Outcomes Research (CHSOR, directed by Albert Wu). CHSOR is devoted to research on the organization and financing of health services, including their impact on care quality and costs, with a recent focus on PCOR, CER, and patient engagement. JHBSPH is also home to the Center for Hospital Finance and Management (directed by Gerard Anderson), which specializes in policy-relevant research on payment reform and other approaches to reducing health care costs. A final key part of the institutional environment is the Johns Hopkins Medicine Alliance for Patients (JMAP), the Johns Hopkins Medicare ACO, which was approved in December 2013. Collaborating with JMAP and its executive director, Scott Berkowitz, affords the opportunity to study engagement in ACOs real-time and to ensure the project addresses issues of concern to ACO implementation. This project synergistically integrates these institutional components and applies them to a novel health care system reform context: system-level patient engagement in ACOs. Its findings - though ACO focused - will be relevant to health system reform generally and provide a strong foundation for future PCOR studies examining the comparative effectiveness of different system-level engagement strategies in terms of health outcomes, patient satisfaction, and costs."
"9355868","SUMMARY This collaborative R01 application between a neuroscience lab (led by Stuart Lipton at Scintllon Inst./UC San Diego) and a chemistry lab (led by Steve Tannenbaum at MIT) will identify the redox posttranslational modification of proteins called S-nitrosylation by developing a more effective and integrated Mass Spec-based platform to screen for the S-nitrosoproteome and resulting alterations in protein function that contribute to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer?s disease (AD). Our hypothesis is that entire biochemical pathways critical to neuronal function are affected by aberrant S-nitrosylation of multiple proteins, these aberrant redox reactions (which are located, at least in part, downstream of Aß insult) contribute to the pathogenesis of AD, and the reactions occur in both sporadic and familial cases of the disease. Chemical and functional analysis of S- nitrosylated proteins will be assessed by biochemical assays, and by imaging of cells and tissues, including human AD brain and various in vitro and in vivo models of AD, ranging from transgenic mice to hiPSC-based model systems. We will also use site-directed mutagenesis and CRISPR/Cas9 techniques to generate DNA constructs or genes encoding proteins that that cannot be S-nitrosylated (thus forming non-nitrosylatable proteins). Accordingly, our Specific Aims are as follows: AIM #1. To determine the S-nitrosoproteome in human AD brain and transgenic mouse models. We will validate our recent S-nitrosoproteome findings in the CK-p25 mouse model of AD (published in PNAS, 2016) and determine if it generalizes to human AD brain and other transgenic mouse models of AD, e.g., hAPP-J20 and Tg2576. AIM #2. To use hiPSC-derived cerebrocortical neurons generated from human AD patients or WT exposed to oligomeric Aß (as a model of sporadic AD) as an in vitro model system to study the S-nitrosoproteome and how it affects biochemical pathways. This approach will allow us to study the functional effect of SNO-proteins in AD in a human context. AIM #3. To screen the effects of various S-nitrosoproteins in hiPSC-based models for impact on potential biological functions, e.g., effect on synaptic loss or neuronal cell death. This will be accomplished by generating non-nitrosylatable constructs of proteins (e.g., substituting Ala for Cys) by replacing the underling gene by CRISPR/Cas9 technology. For selected gene products that manifest profound effects of S- nitrosylation on synaptic functions and neuronal cell survival in hiPSC-based models, the non-nitrosylatable version of the gene can also be created in mice using CRISPR/Cas9 to mechanistically test its effect in vivo."
"9356329","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The blood-brain barrier (BBB) is a tight barrier formed by microvessels and capillaries that control the passage of nutrients, fluids, metabolic products, and drugs between the blood and the brain. Impaired function of the BBB is involved in a number of major pathologies afflicting the brain, such as Alzheimer's disease, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, brain manifestations of AIDS, stroke, and cancer. Although the neurotherapeutics sector is among the largest and fastest growing markets in the pharmaceutical industry, progress is currently impaired by the lack of in vitro assays that reliabl predict in vivo BBB permeability. None of the existing models adequately replicates the organotypic microenvironment of the BBB, in which brain endothelial cells (ECs), pericytes (PCs) and astrocytes (ACs) are arranged in a characteristic architecture. The proposed work utilizes organ-on-chip technology recently developed by Nortis, Inc. for creating 3D tissue microenvironments in disposable microfluidic chips. The chip design enables the integration of living, lumenally perfused microvasculature, making it suitable for studying barrier function. Strikingly, extensive preliminary data indicate that human brain ECs, PCs, and ACs have the capacity to self-assemble into a BBB-like architecture within the Nortis chip. This data will be leveraged to further develop and eventually commercialize BBB models of mouse and human. The objective of Phase I is to achieve a model that replicates critical BBB functions of the mouse brain. The mouse model will be developed and optimized for viability, structure, and function. Expression of tight-junction (TJ) proteins and the transporter P-glycoprotein, an important functional characteristic of the BBB, will be measured. Microvessel permeability will be assessed by perfusion with fluorescently labelled molecules (Aim 1). The model will then be challenged with the barrier-modulating compound lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and evaluated for associated changes in TJ protein expression, molecule permeability, and leukocyte transendothelial migration (Aim 2). During Phase II, the mouse BBB chip will be used to develop and qualify specific BBB assays, such as transferrin receptor transporter activity, BBB permeability challenge with LPS, and stimuli-induced leukocyte transmigration (Aim 1). Success criteria is an assay robustness of Z' ? 0.2. Aim 2 of Phase II is to develop a human BBB model. The human model will be optimized to recapitulate key structural and functional features of the BBB, including TJ formation, permeability, and transporter activity. To demonstrate utility, the model will be treated with LPS, mannitol, and angiotensin II and evaluated for associated changes in BBB structure and function. Each of these compounds has clinical relevance but acts by a different mechanism. Aim 3 is to qualify specific human BBB assays and establish relevance to clinical data. The products developed with support from this grant will significantly enhance progress in basic, translational, and clinical neuroscience research and will significantly advance therapy for numerous devastating diseases."
"9354029","An overarching, central question in all of neuroscience is the specificity, modification, and function of the immense diversity of function-specific circuitry? a question still inaccessible in multiple core aspects. This is what underlies how the brain-nervous system senses, integrates, moves the body, thinks, functions with precision, malfunctions with specificity in disease, degenerates with circuit specificity, might be regenerated, and/or might be modeled in culture. What actually implements and maintains circuit specificity is a key, core issue from developmental specificity of circuits, to developmental abnormalities, to proper function (or dysfunction) and circuit type-specific molecular regulators, to subtype-specific degeneration (e.g. in ALS, Huntington's, Parkinson's diseases), to regeneration (or typical lack thereof) in the CNS for spinal cord injury or with optimal accuracy in the PNS, to mechanistic and therapeutic modeling of disease using iPS/ES-derived neurons. Growth cones (GCs) ?build? circuits and mature into synapses, where human genomic risk associations are showing up in neuropsychiatric diseases such as schizophrenia, autism, bipolar disorder, developmental intellectual disabilities. I propose uniquely enabling, pioneering work on these issues? now possible by our innovative approaches. We are now able to directly investigate molecular machinery of distinct GC subtypes, thus distinct circuits.  Despite their importance, we know little about the diversity and specialization of circuit-specific GCs? the subcellular molecular machines that implement specific circuit wiring, mature with precision into presynaptic halves of immensely diverse synapses, and control the long-standing ?sorting problem?. GCs perform these functions over many days of development for each pathway, often 103-105 cell body diameters away from the nucleus and transcriptional control. Remarkably, but rarely considered, one nucleus, with one transcriptional regulatory machinery, can control 2 or more divergent GCs to wire multi-target circuitry. I propose entirely new, highly innovative, pioneering work in development, cell biology, disease, and regeneration (also relevant to modeling) to uniquely address this critical gap in knowledge.  We developed new approaches to investigate subtype- and stage-specific GCs directly from brains, with high-depth, quantitative proteomic and RNA analysis, and have already completed proof-of-concept experiments enabling a range of pioneering new work. We selectively purify GCs based on neuron subtype, projection trajectory, and developmental stage using a combination of molecular, anatomic, and genetic labeling strategies; subcellular biochemistry; newly developed small-particle sorting; peptide mass spectrometry; and Next Gen sequencing. Simultaneous isolation of protein and RNA from parent somas and their GCs identifies hundreds of proteins and transcripts enriched orders of magnitude in GCs, essentially not detected in parent somas. This indicates that investigation of GCs might actually be required to understand subtype-specific circuitry. GCs appear to be ?programmed? early, then ?poised? to exert quite autonomous local control.  I propose ambitious and venturesome investigations of subtype-, stage-, and target-specific GC proteins and RNAs in multiple specific settings to study mechanisms of development, cell biology, disease, regeneration, & iPS/ES models. These directions range from immediate, to ~5 yrs, to an ~10 yr horizon. Results will generate new hypotheses and investigations."

"9352296","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Errors in medical documents represent a critical issue that can adversely affect healthcare quality and safety. Physician use of speech recognition (SR) technology has risen in recent years due to its ease of use and efficiency at the point of care. However, high error rates, upwards of 10-23%, have been observed in SR-generated medical documents. Error correction and content editing can be time consuming for clinicians. A solution to this problem is to improve accuracy through automated error detection using natural language processing (NLP). In this study, we will provide solutions to these challenges by addressing the following specific aims: 1) build a large corpus of clinical documents dictated via SR across different healthcare institutions and clinical settings; 2) conduct error analysis to estimate the prevalence and severity of SR errors; 3) develop innovative methods based on NLP for automated error detection and correction and create a comprehensive knowledge base that contains confusion sets, error frequencies and other error patterns; 4) evaluate the performance of the proposed methods and tool; and 5) distribute our methods and findings to make them available to other researchers.  We believe this application aligns with AHRQ's HIT and Patient Safety portfolios as well as AHRQ's Special Emphasis Notice to support projects to generate new evidence on health IT system safety (NOT- HS-15-005)."

"9543634","X-ray phase contrast imaging (XPCI) is widely regarded as one of the most exciting techniques to have emerged in x-ray physics, and has potential to significantly change the face of biomedical imaging. XPCI, which is based on the refraction of X-rays rather than their absorption, can provide up to 1000 times greater contrast in soft tissues than absorption contrast, which is the current method employed by x-ray equipment. The technique offers enormous potential for earlier diagnosis of diseases and visualization of features currently not visible through conventional techniques, as well as dramatic reduction in dosage to enable safer screening for cancer. Of the several approaches to XPCI, Talbot interferometry is considered to have the most potential for clinical use, as it does not require a synchrotron source. However, the current approach to Talbot phase contrast requires a grating placed near a conventional laboratory X-ray source (the addition of the source grating is called the Talbot-Lau technique). This has led to limits on the X-ray energies used in Talbot-Lau interferometers of less than <20 keV, which has restricted its use (35-80 keV being more optimal for clinical applications), in addition to reduced source efficiency. We propose to develop a high brightness X-ray source that is optimized to enable clinical Talbot interferometers at the higher energies that are relevant to clinical applications. The source employs a novel microstructured anode, which is comprised of an array of tungsten micron-sized X-ray emitters embedded in a material of excellent thermal conductivity and low density (diamond). These micro-emitters act as an array of small sources, which would remove the need for the source grating, and the inclusion of diamond provides superior thermal properties for high brightness. The proposed Phase I 9-month project is a proof-of-principle demonstration that the novel microstructured anode can be manufactured and would provide the desired thermal benefits and x-ray output, and the proposed Phase II 24-month project would produce two working prototypes of the source."
"9352677","Project Summary Obesity is a global epidemic that is linked to a number of devastating diseases, such as type 2 diabetes and heart disease. Studies of obesity and adipose tissue function can help us comprehend these diseases and identify possible strategies to prevent them. Thermogenic adipocytes are a type of fat cell that upregulates a thermogenic program in response to cold stimuli. This upregulation of the thermogenic program causes adipocytes to disperse energy as heat, as opposed to storing it. Thermogenic adipocytes recently have been identified in adult humans, and studies have shown that active thermogenic adipocytes in humans are correlated with improved metabolic parameters, suggesting that these cells are a promising target for diabetes and obesity therapies. My preliminary data show that treatment of adipocytes with the transient receptor potential cation channel A1 (TRPA1) agonists cinnamaldehyde (CA) and allyl isothiosyanate (AITC) increases thermogenic gene expression. I hypothesize that TRPA1 mediates a thermogenic response in adipocytes and that TRPA1 agonism will improve cold tolerance and counteract obesity. I propose to study the thermogenesis- associated changes in mouse and human thermogenic adipocytes in response to TRPA1 activation and the effect that TRPA1 agonism or knockout has on regulating thermogenesis and glucose metabolism in vivo. Aim 1: To characterize the mechanisms by which TRPA1 mediates regulation of thermogenesis at the cellular level. My preliminary data have shown that both mouse and human subcutaneous adipocytes upregulate thermogenic gene expression in response to treatment with the TRPA1 agonists CA and AITC. Additionally, both mouse and human subcutaneous cells upregulate thermogenic gene expression in response to cold exposure. In this aim I will characterize the mechanisms by which TRPA1 agonism upregulates thermogenesis in fat cells by investigating the role that TRPA1 agonism plays in regulating both mitochondrial function and lipolysis. Aim 2: To determine the role that TRPA1 plays in regulating whole-body metabolism. Past studies have shown that inducing thermogenesis in thermogenic fat can counteract obesity and improve glucose metabolism. In this aim I will use mouse models to investigate the role that TRPA1 knockout or agonism has on regulating the thermogenic response to cold and improving glucose metabolism by studying the effects that TRPA1 agonist oral gavage has on regulating thermogenesis in fat tissue and in counteracting high fat diet induced obesity."
"9339316","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant) Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a highly aggressive and metastatic form of breast cancer that is characterized by a lack of the estrogen, progesterone, and HER2 receptor, which renders it resistant to targeted and hormone therapies. TNBC patients tend to be young, thus, the need to develop effective targeted therapies for this subgroup of patients is particularly urgent. The molecular basis for the high metastatic potential of TNBC is unknown. TNBC expresses high levels of a metastasis-inducing protein, CUB-domain containing protein 1 (CDCP1), which has been correlated with the aggressive nature of many forms of cancer, including TNBC.  CDCP1 can be proteolytically processed from a full-length, 135 kDa (flCDCP1), to a cleaved, 70 kDa (cCDCP1), isoform by trypsin, matriptase, and plasmin. Recent reports have highlighted the unique signaling cascades induced by 70 kDa cCDCP1, which include degradation of adherens junctions, evasion of PARP1 mediated apoptosis, and enhancement of PKC?, Akt, and FAK signaling. Furthermore, we and others have observed that CDCP1 exists mostly in the cleaved state in multiple TNBC cell lines.  Our lab and others have shown that CDCP1 is phosphorylated by Src family kinase (SFKs), which stimulates the recruitment of PKC? to the CDCP1/SFK complex, resulting in PKC? phosphorylation. PKC? activation results in migration of cells in vitro. It is not clear if phosphorylation and cleavage are the only steps in activation of CDCP1 and its downstream signaling. The objective of this project is to dissect the mechanism of CDCP1 activation and determine a strategy to block it and inhibit CDCP1-induced migration.  My recent work in HEK 293T cells shows a dramatic increase PKC?, p38 MAPK, ERK1/2, and Akt phosphorylation in cCDCP1 transfected HEK 293T cells, as opposed to flCDCP1 transfected cells. These findings support the necessity of CDCP1 cleavage for its activation. Furthermore, I found that only cCDCP1 can form a dimer, which we propose to occur through its CUB domains known to be involved in protein-protein interactions. The importance for this dimer in CDCP1 pro-migratory signaling remains to be investigated.  These studies aim to determine the role of the CDCP1 dimer in CDCP1-mediated metastasis. I propose that inhibiting CDCP1 dimerization is a rationale therapeutic to inhibit CDCP1-mediated metastasis as some current FDA approved anti-cancer therapies inhibit dimerization of their respective targets; Herceptin, Pertuzumab, and Cetuximab."

"9321799","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose to extend our Center for Excellence for Research in Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CERC)-The Wisconsin Center for the Neuroscience and Psychophysiology of Meditation-for a second five-year period. This will be a highly focused center dedicated to novel and cutting edge research on the mechanisms by meditation works. In the next five-year period, two of the original three projects will continue wih important new components. Project 1 (Davidson, PI) will examine the impact of the explicit use of mindfulness and loving-kindness-compassion strategies on emotion regulation, specifically neural, hormonal and behavioral (including facial electromyography in the scanner) indices of reactivity to and recovery from pictures of human suffering and flourishing. Project 2 will be directed by William Busse, a well-known asthma researcher at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Based upon collaborative work by Busse and Davidson that established the neural circuitry activated by asthma-relevant emotional stimuli that predicts inflammatory response in asthmatics, we propose to examine the impact of Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) on altering the neural signals and inflammatory response in the lung in a group of asthmatics. The third project will be focused on sleep and directed by Giulio Tononi. This project will extend our previous findings by examining whether the increase in gamma oscillations during NREM sleep in meditators is associated with changes in mental content during sleep. In addition, relations between sleep and waking EEG and between sleep EEG changes and waking performance on cognitive and attentional measures, and experience sampling measures, will be studied. Each of these projects will be conducted with the identical group of participants recruited through our Core that will include those randomized assigned to MBSR, the active comparison intervention we explicitly developed to test against MBSR~the Health Enhancement Program (HEP)~or a wait list (WL), as well as Long-Term Meditators (LTMs). We believe that the understanding of the mechanisms by which meditation produces changes in behavioral and biological processes will be dramatically advanced through the work of this CERC."
"9484830","Abstract - Research Project 3  TITLE: The effect of a needs-targeted intervention on racial disparities in unmet needs of  patients and families in the intensive care unit  The quality of palliative care is highly variable for the nearly 5 million annual ICU admissions.  Many patients and families report unmet needs and poor communication and decision making;  however, these reports are more common among African Americans and their families who are  less satisfied with the quality of ICU care. Improving ICU care quality on a broad scale is  challenging because of a limited palliative care workforce and ICU clinicians' difficulties in  proactively identifying and addressing unmet needs among diverse patients and family  members. To address these challenges to care delivery, we developed a mobile app that allows  patients and families to self-report needs, receive information about palliative care, and get  examples of questions that can improve understanding. Clinicians can visualize patient/family  needs and decisional support on how to address them. In a series of pilot studies, we found  that the need app is acceptable, feasible, and can reduce unmet palliative care needs in  race/ethnically diverse populations.   While our pilot data are promising, we need to definitively determine the effectiveness of the  intervention and its effect on racial disparities in care. The proposed study will: (1) Optimize the  app platform's usability in a racially diverse population, (2) Test the impact of app-augmented  care vs usual care in a stepped-wedge trial on reducing racial disparities (African Americans  and Whites) in unmet needs and satisfaction with care; and (3) Explore patient, family member,  and clinician experiences using mixed methods to understand intervention mechanisms within  unique case contexts. We hypothesize that compared to usual care, needs app-augmented  care will reduce family members' unmet needs and psychological distress, increase the  frequency of patients' receipt of goal concordant treatment, and reduce hospital length of stay in  both whites and African Americans."
"9505872","Program Director/Principal Investigator (Last, First, Middle): Makadzange, Azure Tariro In 2014 UNAIDS set ambitious goals to achieve 90% virologic suppression rates among individuals on ART. In Zimbabwe this is an ambitious target particularly among adolescents; <5% of HIV infected individuals received HIV viral load (VL) testing in 2015 and treatment failure rates among adolescents range between 35-42%. Adolescents failing ART also have high rates of drug resistance. Scalable strategies to facilitate improved VL monitoring, adherence support and genotyping for those with persistent viremia are urgently needed. We have shown that dried blood spot (DBS) samples can be used for routine VL monitoring on existing technologies. We have also adapted an evidence based, widely used, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) adherence intervention (Life-Steps) for use in Zimbabwe and have identified a low-cost genotyping strategy that can facilitate detection of drug resistance mutations using already existing RT-PCR technology. We hypothesize that our proposed package of care will result in a decrease in virologic failure rates among adolescents. Our primary study objective is to determine if implementation of a package of care that includes DBS based viral load monitoring, coupled with an evidence-based intervention to improve ART adherence using cognitive- behavioral principles and genotyping for those with persistent viremia decreases 12-month virologic failure rates among HIV-infected adolescents compared with standard of care. We will also adapt and integrate Nzira Itsva for Adolescents (NI), a cultural adaptation of Life-Steps into routine care as an adherence support intervention for HIV infected adolescents, and implement a novel low-cost genotyping assay using Pan Degenerate Amplification and Adaptation (PANDAA) of viral RNA as a point mutation assay for the detection of drug resistance. Process and cost data will be collected for subsequent cost-analysis. The proposed intervention will be a two-arm cluster-randomized trial in Mashonaland West and Matabeleland North provinces of Zimbabwe. The units of randomization will be public and largely rural clinics within the provinces, with sites randomized to the intervention or to the standard of care. The study is anticipated to show that the use of DBS in routine monitoring of adolescents is feasible, to show that CBT if incorporated into routine counseling activities can complement viral load monitoring and genotyping to reduce treatment failure rates and preserve therapeutic options for infected adolescents. The results of this study will have important implications in Zimbabwe and other low-income countries in sub-Saharan Africa with a large proportion of HIV infected adolescents. The study will include young adolescents 10-14 years, as well as older adolescents 14-19 years and therefore provide data that will guide implementation of strategies for virologic success in the growing number of children who are surviving on ART into adolescents, as well as for behaviorally infected adolescents.

"9536976","This study is designed to test a novel paradigm that the human genome dynamically interacts with the environment and that epigenetic mechanisms are at the interface of genome- environment interactions. The human genome is marked by structural variations including large copy number variations and differences in repetitive sequences. Environmental pollutants such as polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are associated with DNA methylation changes. Chromosome 15q11-q13 duplication syndrome (Dup15q), is one of the most common copy number variations (CNV) observed in neurodevelopmental disorders. This proposal is based on the findings that human brain samples with Dup15q syndrome showed significantly higher levels of the persistent organic pollutant PCB 95 than controls or idiopathic autism cases, and that the interaction of both Dup15q and PCB 95 cumulatively impacted the methylation of over 1000 genes, enriched for autism candidate genes with synaptic functions. Three aims are proposed to test the overarching hypothesis that the cumulative impact of multiple risk factors converge on common gene pathways and are detectable as epigenetic signatures in early life tissues. The first aim seeks to determine the mechanism by which UBE3A overexpression interacts with PCB-95 exposure on histone H2A.Z biding sites genome-wide using next generation sequencing, siRNA knockdown, and CRISPR/Cas9 technologies. The second aim investigates the interaction between a human-relevant mixture of PCB congeners and UBE3A overexpression on the methylome and transcriptome in dental pulp stem cells derived from baby teeth from Dup15q and control children. The third aim seeks to identify potential methylation biomarkers of POP exposures and CNV in placenta samples from a human prospective autism study and a rhesus macaque model of maternal obesity. The results of these studies are expected to formally test the hypothesis that DNA methylation levels reduced by cumulative impacts of environmental pollutants and genetic changes may result in alterations in chromatin, leading to transcriptional changes and adverse health outcomes. In addition, epigenetic alterations of autism candidate genes involved in synaptogenesis are expected to be uncovered by this approach and be established as perinatal epigenetic biomarkers of cumulative risk assessments, as well as guiding future behavioral and pharmacological treatments. Finally, the results of these studies are expected to be broadly relevant to understanding the relationship between the genome, environmental exposures, and the epigenome in human health and disease."
"9353867","Abstract Diabetic retinopathy is the leading cause of blindness among US adults between the ages of 20 and 74 years. Laser photocoagulation surgery has been established as an effective way of treating retinopathy if it is detected early. Yearly retinal screening examinations are a potent tool in the battle to reduce the incidence of blindness from diabetic retinopathy because they provide diabetic patients with timely diagnoses and consequently, the potential for timely treatment. Primary care safety net clinics provide monitoring and other services for diabetic patients but they are often not equipped to provide specialty care services such as retinal screenings. Access to specialists who can provide retinal screenings can be increased through the use of telemedicine, which has shown great promise as a means of screening for diabetic retinopathy in the US and internationally. A pilot study by Charles Drew University investigators had a total of 2,876 teleretinal screenings performed for diabetic retinopathy, with 2,732 unique diabetic patients from six South Los Angeles safety net clinics screened. The present study aims to build on this prior work by: (a) developing novel software that utilizes information from clinical records to detect latent diabetic retinopathy in diabetic patients who have not yet received an annual eye examination, and (b) devising methods to speed up the diabetic retinopathy detection process for diabetic patients who have had digital retinal images taken by partially automating the process using image processing and machine learning techniques. Specifically, we propose to: 1. Develop predictive models for diabetic retinopathy using risk factors collected from patient clinical records. 2. Develop predictive models for automated diabetic retinopathy assessment using a combination of patient  risk factor data and data from digital retinal images previously evaluated by experts. 3. Evaluate the predictive accuracy of: a) the models developed for specific aim 2, and, b) the assessments of  optometrist readers against standard of care dilated retinal examinations by board certified  ophthalmologists for 300 diabetic patients utilizing a new Los Angeles County reading center. 4. Create web-based software tools based on the predictive models developed in specific aim 1 that can be  used to initiate outreach to high-risk patients in under-resourced settings, boosting detection rates for those  patients who are most at risk for diabetic retinopathy. 5. Establish targeted outreach methods to promote screening for patients that the predictive models from  specific aim 1 identify as potentially having undetected diabetic retinopathy."
"9571405","Abstract The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) set the standards for large-scale cancer genome projects worldwide. In the next phase, the National Cancer Institute and its Center for Cancer Genomics are planning large-scale projects closely tied to clinical questions and trials. In order to perform the analysis of these data, the NCI is creating a Genome Data Analysis Network (GDAN) of different types of Genome Data Analysis Centers (GDACs). Central to this Network is a single Processing GDAC, which will take all the harmonized data, as stored in the NCI's Genomics Data Commons, and perform higher level integrated analyses on these data to support both the Analysis Working Groups (AWGs) within the Network (which will be formed for each project to perform special analyses of the data and write manuscripts) as well as the entire biomedical research community. Herein we propose to build the centralized Processing GDAC on top of our FireCloud platform, an infrastructure to run large scale computation on the cloud in a fully rigorous and reproducible fashion. FireCloud development was based on our experience with Firehose, the Broad internal platform on which the standard TCGA data and analyses currently run. We propose to create and operate the GDAN Standard Workflow, incorporating tools actively developed and used within the GDAN and across the entire field, with particular emphasis on clinical tools. This Workflow will serve as the starting point for AWGs and set the highest standards of transparency, reproducibility and rigor for cancer genome analysis. The results of the Standard Workflow will be stored in a public database, and accessible via standard APIs, and used together with a continuously updated database of prior knowledge to create scientific reports that will be made available to the community, in a pre-publication manner. Finally, a major innovation is that AWG members will be able to login into FireCloud and rerun the entire workflow, or parts of it, with their own parameters and subsets of the data ? thus making the entire GDAN analysis fully reproducible and scalable. Our goals are therefore: (1) To create a global infrastructure for collaborative extreme- scale cancer analysis; (2) Operate the Standard Workflows at scale; (3) Rapidly and continuously evolve the Standard Workflows; and (4) created improved capabilities for reporting, exploring the results, clinical diagnostics and reproducibility."
"9440610","The NIH APOL1 Long-term Transplantation Outcomes Network (APOLLO) Collaborative U01 will perform a national prospective evaluation of donor and recipient APOL1 renal-risk variants in all US kidney transplants from African American kidney donors to determine their effect on transplant outcomes. In addition, the post- donation health and kidney function of African American living kidney donors will be assessed. We are applying to be the APOLLO Scientific and Data Research Center (SDRC) for this NIH Funding Announcement. Shorter renal allograft survival is observed for transplantations from deceased African American kidney donors, relative to deceased European American kidney donors. Reasons for this are unknown, but retrospective reports suggest that presence of two apolipoprotein L1 gene (APOL1) renal-risk variants in kidney donors may contribute to the disparity. These variants are common in populations with recent African ancestry (such as African Americans), where they are strongly associated with non-diabetic end-stage kidney disease, but rare in other racial/ethnic groups. APOL1 genotype data may provide more accurate assessment of the likelihood for long-term renal allograft function in donor kidneys, thereby improving the matching of donor kidneys with potential recipients in order to optimize renal allograft and patient survival. This information may better inform physicians about organ quality prior to decisions on allocation are made and regarding the safety of living kidney donation. Before this genotypic data can be used clinically, a prospective national study is required to evaluate all kidney transplantation outcomes from African American donors and recipients of their kidneys based on APOL1 genotypes. Information lacking from retrospective studies needs to be collected, including recipient APOL1 genotypes, renal histologic data in failed allografts and presence or development of BK viral infections, donor specific antibodies, and acute rejections after kidney transplantation. We will perform the following activities for the APOLLO Network: overall study coordination, assist with preparation of the final protocol and Manual of Procedures, develop data tracking tools and the study website, collect and archive clinical and outcomes data, perform genotyping, statistical analyses, assessment of the primary outcome ?time to allograft failure in transplanted kidneys from African American donors, based on donor APOL1 genotypes? and create a bio-repository. We will longitudinally assess vital status, kidney function and proteinuria in living African American kidney donors based on APOL1 genotypes. Prospective assessment of the effects of kidney donor APOL1 genotypes on serum creatinine concentration, estimated glomerular filtration rate, and proteinuria in transplant recipients with functioning allografts will also be performed. Results have the potential to transform the organ allocation and informed consent processes in kidney transplantation, optimize renal allograft survival, reduce the discard of good-quality kidneys, and protect the health of living kidney donors."
"9217377","Research Abstract  The goal of this project is to elucidate the enzymatic pathways that underlie the biosynthesis of lipids that are produced by human meibomian glands (HMG) and are collectively known as meibum. Meibum is a critically important part of the tear film (TF) that, among other functions, protects the ocular surface from desiccating. Meibum is formed predominantly from a unique mixture of very, and extremely, long chain complex lipids. Our previous projects were devoted to biochemical and biophysical characterization of meibomian lipids (ML). Now we propose to investigate the biosynthetic pathways that lead to the formation of meibum in HMG. The following three lines of research are proposed: (I). Despite recent progress in the characterization of the lipidomes of meibum and TF, there is no clear understanding of the biosynthetic path- ways involved in the biosynthesis of meibum. The unusual and, often, unique qualities of ML imply their in situ and/or de novo origination, which, in turn, requires proper molecular mechanisms to be implemented in HMG. We will study the levels of expression, and map, major lipid-metabolizing enzymes and related proteins, which, based on our preliminary studies, are expected to be present in HMG. This will be achieved by using a combination of approaches, such as microarray RNA analyses, immunohistochemistry/immunocytochemistry, in-situ hybridization, proteomics, and lipidomics. (II). Recent reports indicate that high total blood lipid levels, including cholesterol and TAG, are correlated with higher incidence and/or severity of MG dysfunction. Also, a positive impact of ?3 fatty acids (?3FA) supplements on the ocular surface was reported for humans and mice. Yet, the reasons and molecular mechanisms of these effects are unknown. We will determine the balance between the in situ/de novo biosynthesis of ML and the levels and composition of blood lipids. We will test if 1) enhanced intake of pharmaceutical doses of ?3FA, and (2) use of statins, can have a positive impact on the biosynthesis, composition and properties of meibum. (III). Recently, we reported that: (1) up to 20% of normal meibum is formed of non-lipid components; (2) there are considerable differences between normal and DE meibum: the latter is enriched with non-lipid material, and forms lipid layers that are less structurally stable than those formed of healthy meibum. Based on those findings, we propose to assess the non-lipid content of mei- bum using: (a) metabolomic approaches based on HPLC-MS, GC-MS, and 2D-DESI MS; (b) Western blot with specific antibodies against major meibum and TF proteins; (c) histochemical approaches targeting proteins and polysaccharides; (d) various biophysical methods, such as hot stage polarized light microscopy, microcalori- metry, Brewster angle microscopy, to study rheological and melting characteristics of meibum and tear film lipids. We believe that our work will provide innovative information that may lead to new concepts in medical treatment of MG-related diseases and conditions, and may establish a link between them and dyslipidemia."

"9287116","The perception of complex motion patterns, which requires integration of multiple moving elements, is impaired in a range of developmental disorders. In the brain, processing of complex motion signals is handled by a dedicated visual pathway that includes primary visual cortex (V1) and a higher order motion area. Very little is known about the mechanisms that determine its development, as is the case for most higher level visual functions. Here, we will test one factor likely to play a major role in its development, visual experience. We will investigate when visual experience is required for the motion pathway to develop, and what kind of visual experience is required. We will perform these experiments in the ferret, which has become a major animal model for visual development because of its relative immaturity at birth. The ferret?s motion pathway includes V1 and area PSS, a higher order visual area. We will investigate the influence of visual experience on this pathway in 2 sets of experiments. In the first set of experiments, we will investigate during which time visual experience is required for the motion pathway to develop normally. To this end, we will raise animals either normally, or withhold visual experience for certain time periods. We will then investigate how lack of visual experience impacts the pathway?s function by measuring direction selectivity in V1 and PSS, and signatures of motion integration in V1 and PSS. These experiments will be performed using extracellular recordings in PSS, and two-photon imaging combined with retrograde tracers in V1 to selectively study the responses of PSS- projecting V1 neurons. We will also perform behavioral experiments in adult animals to investigate whether there are lasting consequences on motion perception. We expect to find 2 critical periods during which vision is required, an initial period for the development of direction selectivity, and a later period for motion integration. This would demonstrate that visual experience has a sustained impact on the developing visual system. In a second set of experiments, we will test which kinds of visual experience are required for motion pathway development by testing the impact of different kinds of visual experience on the immature motion pathway. More precisely, we will determine whether complex motion stimuli containing multiple moving elements, simple moving stimuli containing only one moving element, or static stimuli can enhance immature direction selectivity and motion integration. We expect to find that only simple motion, but not static stimuli, can enhance direction selectivity. We also expect to find that complex motion, but none of the other stimuli can enhance motion integration. These findings would demonstrate that different visual functions require different kinds of visual experience for their development. In summary, our experiments would be a systematic investigation of how visual experience impacts the development of an important higher vision pathway. They would contribute important insights into the mechanisms shaping the development of higher visual cortex, and may help identify reasons for the deficits in motion processing observed in a range of developmental disorders."

We provide support, services, datasets, and biospecimens to institutional, regional, national, and international investigators.  The KU ADC transforms AD-relevant research at our home institution and is an indispensable part of the KU neuroscience landscape. We benefit from and enhance an institutional T32 program, receive regular support from an institutional neuroscientist training fund, work closely with KU departments on neuroscientist faculty recruitment, and are a key component of the KU Institute for Neurologic Discoveries (KU IND). We further maintain interactive collaborations with other KU entities including the KU Landon Center on Aging (LCOA), Clinical Translational Science Award (CTSA) Center, NeuroNext site, and KU Cancer Center. We create AD-related clinical and educational infrastructure, making us a vital community and regional set-piece.  While the KU ADC promotes an array of AD research, a prominent Center objective is to support, promote, and advance studies that address the causes and consequences of altered energy metabolism in aging and AD. Changes in energy metabolism (i.e, bioenergetics) have been linked to brain aging and AD. The KU ADC has developed a unique infrastructure that enables innovative research pertinent to basic, translational, and clinical energy metabolism-relevant questions. We are uniquely positioned to explore how altered energy metabolism contributes to brain aging and AD, and test the therapeutic potential of energy metabolism manipulations for the treatment of AD. We currently support state of the art programs that are testing the effects of physical exercise and dietary interventions on brain health, developing pharmacologic approaches to manipulate brain energy metabolism, exploring the contribution of mitochondrial genes to AD, and validating mitochondrial and other energy metabolism-related biomarkers. By advancing our understanding of energy metabolism's role in AD at multiple levels, developing novel capabilities, and testing innovative approaches intended to measure, characterize, and treat AD energy metabolism dysfunction we address a critical AD knowledge gap and position ourselves to potentially shift current AD research and clinical practice paradigms.  Our first funding cycle (2011-16) focused on Center infrastructure, and our second funding cycle will extend our portfolio of federally funded investigator projects to further complement the first class, innovative research programs we currently support. Through these efforts and the research infrastructure we provide, we will pursue our mission to develop interventions that can prevent and treat AD. We will accomplish these goals through the following Specific Aims: (1) Advance AD and brain aging research; (2) Serve as a Midwestern hub for AD research, clinical care, and education; and (3) Enhance the ADC network."

"9468919","ABSTRACT Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) are at an alarming risk of cardiovascular disease and fracture- associated mortality. CKD results in a sequelae of physiological changes, including a triad of abnormal biochemistries, bone remodeling changes and vascular calcification, that culminate in increased morbidity and mortality. There is a critical need to better understand the underlying mechanism driving altered cardiovascular and skeletal homeostasis, as well as any connection between the two. Chronic kidney disease has been shown to have negative effects on vascular reactivity and end-organ perfusion. Extensive work in CKD has documented vascular changes to the aorta, coronary vessels and gastrointestinal resistance arteries. Surprisingly, exploration of skeletal perfusion and vasculature has not been undertaken in CKD even though hyperparathyroidism is common in CKD and the role of PTH in modulating vasculature, including that of the bone, has been well- established in the literature. Alterations in bone blood flow are linked to dysregulation of bone remodeling and mass in multiple conditions. Based on the above scientific premise, the goal of the present study is to test the hypothesis that elevated PTH contributes to maladaptive changes to the skeletal vasculature that contribute to the skeletal deterioration in CKD. This study will explore connections between the cardiovascular and skeletal systems by studying the contributions of bone remodeling rate and parathyroid hormone levels on skeletal blood flow and vascular properties in the setting of CKD. This will be tested through the use of a slowly progressive model of CKD-MBD, the Cy/+ rat. The first Aim is to establish the effect of CKD on skeletal blood flow and vascular properties. This will be accomplished by examining bone blood flow and vascular reactivity of the principal nutrient artery (PNA) of the femur in 30 and 35-week-old Cy/+ rats and their normal littermates. These time points represent mild and severe CKD. Specifically, outcomes will include regional bone perfusion (tissue fluorescence density of injected fluorescent microspheres), PNA vascular reactivity (myogenic tone, endothelial- independent relaxation, endothelial-dependent relaxation and response to PTH), bone turnover (histomorphometry), and biochemistries. The second Aim is to uncouple the effects of remodeling suppression and PTH suppression on bone vasculature properties. This will be accomplished by treating Cy/+ rats with either parathyroidectomy (PTX; to lower PTH and bone remodeling) or bisphosphonate (to lower bone remodeling without affecting PTH). We expect that PTX will normalize both bone blood flow and PNA vascular reactivity, while bisphosphonate will not normalize bone blood flow or PNA vascular reactivity. An understanding of the detrimental impact of CKD on bone blood flow is a crucial step in understanding bone disease in these patients. This study provides an important step in achieving this goal by examining these changes and their potential corrections in a rat model with the spontaneous and progressive development of chronic kidney disease."

"9446733","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Tremor is the most common movement disorder. It impairs voluntary actions by causing intense shaking during walking, eating, and speaking. The shaking is repetitive and highly rhythmic as the affected body parts ?oscillate? back and forth. Oscillation frequency is a defining feature of tremor; distinct tremors are found in Parkinson's disease, dystonia, and essential tremor (ET). Because tremor disorders have a neurological basis, it implies that specific brain oscillations drive the body to oscillate at the same frequency. However, it is still not clear where in the central nervous system the oscillations begin, and the processes that lead to oscillations in the connected brain regions remain unknown. In ET, which is the most prevalent form of pathological tremor, a hindbrain motor region called the cerebellum has been heavily implicated as the major source of abnormal activity. But, how abnormal cerebellar activity leads to oscillating motions has been challenging to test. This is largely because of the lack of an appropriate animal model. To address this problem, we identified a mouse genetic model that exhibits the core features of ET. We have generated compelling preliminary data showing that the loss of a Purkinje cell gene, Car8, causes an ET-like tremor that mimics the human condition in its frequency, progression with age, and responsiveness to alcohol. Here, we will expand on this work by testing the hypothesis that loss of Car8 function causes cerebellar oscillations that drive tremorgenic activity in the thalamocortical circuit. In our first aim, we will trace the path of the 4- 12Hz tremor oscillations from the cerebellum to the inferior olive, thalamus, and motor cortex in active mice. We will therefore identify the major brain oscillators that contribute to ET pathophysiology. In our second aim, we define the cellular origin of the tremor by testing if genetically and optogenetically altering Purkinje cell firing modulates tremor in Car8 mice. Because cerebellar inhibitory interneurons are also implicated in ET, we will also test if modulating their activity onto Purkinje cells influences tremor. This experiment will address how local circuit wiring impacts network-wide oscillations. Next we will take advantage of the robust connectivity of the cerebellar nuclei with the rest of the motor system, plus the efficacy of deep brain stimulation (DBS). In our third aim, we will use the Car8 mice to test whether the cerebellar nuclei are an effective target for DBS. We hypothesize that directing the DBS to the cerebellar nuclei will prevent the spread of pathological oscillations away from the source. The utility of Car8 as a preclinical model shows promise towards uncovering the mechanisms for how DBS works. Our research has importance to human health because we introduce a multi-disciplinary approach to study a broad spectrum of tremors that are all challenging to define, diagnose, and treat."

"9567278","ABSTRACT  Adropin is a recently identified and highly conserved polypeptide abundantly expressed in the brain. Adropin plays a critical role in the regulation of endothelial function, insulin sensitivity, and metabolism. Recent findings from our group and others reveal that adropin can significantly reduce endothelial permeability in rat brain and human vascular endothelial cells. Clinical studies show a significant association between low plasma levels of adropin and endothelial dysfunction in several human diseases. Endothelial dysfunction is one of the critical factors contributing to the pathogenesis of ischemic stroke. Deficient production of nitric oxide (NO) by endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) is a key factor contributing to endothelial dysfunction in diabetes, obesity, and hyperlipidemia, which are important risks factors for stroke. Our overall goal in this proposal is to demonstrate the protective role of adropin in ischemic stroke and investigate the underlying molecular mechanisms of this protection. Our hypothesis is that adropin confers protection against ischemic stroke injury by reducing damage to the blood-brain barrier (BBB)/neurovascular unit. Our preliminary data support this hypothesis by showing that treatment with synthetic adropin dramatically reduces stroke injury in a mouse model, which was associated with a significant increase in eNOS phosphorylation and reduced BBB damage. Moreover, adropin protection was completely abolished in eNOS deficient mice suggesting an eNOS-dependent mechanism underlying the protective effects of adropin in stroke. Aim 1 is to determine the long-term effects of adropin treatment on infarct size and functional recovery in a mouse model of ischemic stroke. In Aim 2, we will determine the ability of adropin to reduce the detrimental effects of endothelial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and neuroinflammation on BBB function following ischemic stroke. In Aim 3, we will test the neuroprotective efficacy of adropin in relation to age, sex, species, and comorbid conditions (obesity and diabetes). It is our expectation that this study will provide significant knowledge on the protective efficacy of adropin in ischemic stroke. Such results would be expected to have an important positive impact, since they would set the stage for expanded preclinical work on the neuroprotective efficacy of adropin in cerebral ischemia, and would identify novel and much-needed approaches to reduce the devastating consequences of neurovascular injury after stroke."

"9317282","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Reducing the risk of food allergic episodes at retail food establishments. Food allergies are a serious public health concern. It is estimated that each year food allergies are responsible for roughly 30,000 medical emergencies and 150-200 deaths. Research suggests that food allergic episodes are significantly associated with eating at restaurants or other food service establishments. There is no cure for food allergens however, with a basic knowledge of what food allergens are, and how to avoid cross contact during food preparation, food allergic episodes can be prevented. This study will focus on food allergen educational and food preparation interventions that would increase the likelihood of food workers to engage in food allergen avoidance practices and thereby preventing or reducing the risk of food allergic episodes. The goal of this practice research study will be to design and implement evidence based, cost effective training strategy based on food allergy educational and practice needs at retail food establishments. The first objective of this practice research study will be to assess food allergen knowledge and avoidance practices at restaurants to better understand educational and practice needs of food managers, workers, and wait staff, design and implement an effective and practical training intervention, then measure the effectiveness of the training through the improved knowledge and practices at the facilities in food allergen avoidance. The second objective will be to provide a food allergen prevention training strategy to the local food regulatory communities to enhance their food allergen illness awareness and prevention educational efforts during the inspection process or in a classroom setting. To accomplish both of these objectives, CA EHS-Net will:  1. Establish strategic partnerships with food service industry and the regulatory community.  2. Increase awareness of food allergens, its associated risk and avoidance strategies.  3. Develop, design and implement evidence based, cost effective training strategy,  based on food allergy educational and practice needs at retail food establishments. The anticipated outcome of this practice-research intervention study and forthcoming food allergen training strategy, is that it will be used by local food regulatory personnel to enhance food allergen illness awareness and prevention educational efforts during the inspection process or in a classroom setting, and thereby increasing the likelihood of food workers to engage in food allergen avoidance practices. Measurable outcomes of this research practice study will be in alignment with the EHS-Net performance goals to prevent or reduce illness, injury and death related to environmental risk factors. The results of this practice research intervention study may also create a shift in programmatic focus for the food regulatory community, policy changes at local government level, and legislative changes at the state level to promote greater awareness, education and prevention regarding food allergens at retail food establishments."
"9566397","Iron concentration in deep gray matter (DGM) regions is associated with neurodegenerative disease, but DGM iron also increases with adult age, in the absence of disease. Previous studies have reported association between age-related DGM iron accumulation and decline in some aspects of neurocognitive function. However, previous studies have typically focused on a limited number of neurocognitive outcome measures, often biased towards motor functioning, and have relied on less than optimal MRI methods to estimate iron concentration, such as MRI relaxometry. Further, although decline in structural and functional brain connectivity appears to contribute to neurocognitive decline in healthy aging, the role of iron in this decline is not clear. In this project we test a model of the influence of age-related DGM iron accumulation on neurocognitive function, proposing that age-related DGM iron contributes to oxidative stress and consequently to a decline in network connectivity. The research will investigate the effects of DGM iron using Quantitative Susceptibility Mapping (QSM), a novel and validated technique that has several advantages over previous methods for estimating GM iron (e.g., relaxometry). This research comprises imaging and neurocognitive testing of 270 healthy, community-dwelling individuals, with 45 individuals in each of six age decades: 20s, 30s, 40s, 50s, 60s, and 70s. The participants in their 60s and 70s will be tested at two time points, approximately 3 years apart. Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that iron in the head of the caudate will have a greater mediating or moderating influence, on the relation between age and the neurocognitive measures, relative to other DGM regions, and that this influence will extend to measures of the efficiency of decision processes (drift rate). Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that age-related increase in DGM iron, particularly in the head of the caudate, influences structural and functional connectivity in a serial manner, with regionally specific associations among DGM iron, the white matter (WM) integrity of frontostriatal circuits, and the functional connectivity of associated resting-state networks (RSNs). Aim 3 will test the hypothesis that the age-related influences of DGM iron identified in Aims 1 and 2, in cross-sectional analyses, can be confirmed longitudinally, across a three-year interval. The project will consequently contribute to a more comprehensive theoretical model, than presently available, of the influence of DGM iron on the relation between age and neurocognitive performance. The findings will also be relevant to assessing the potential role of DGM iron as a biomarker of neurodegenerative disease."
"9428388","Project Summary/Abstract Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a devastating complex neurological degenerative disorder affecting 10% of people over 65 with no cure. The overarching goal of the proposed study is to identify and functionally characterize AD-associated SNPs utilizing novel functional genomic approaches and iPSC-derived cellular models. Our plans include: (1) Determine the functional significance of candidate SNPs in three iPSC-drived 2D AD relevant cell types. (2) Identify genes regulated by distal non-coding SNPs in three iPSC-drived 2D AD relevant cell types. (3) Test the biological consequences of high confidence AD rSNPs from (1) and (2) in isogenic iPSC- derived 2D cell cultures and 3D minibrain organoids. The designed study will be very first comprehensive investigation of AD associated SNPs, thus will shed light on how non-coding genetic variations contribute to AD. Obtaining knowledge for the fundamental genetic mechanisms of AD will expand our horizons to develop improved preventative and diagnostic methods, and also yield targets for novel therapeutic interventions, ultimately leading to a cure for AD."
"9352769","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  ANti-infective Stewardship using the Wisca tool in the Electronic medical Record (The ANSWER study) Beginning in the mid-to late 1980s and accelerating through the 1990s and 2000s the shield of antibiotic invincibility began to crack sufficiently so tat it was apparent to everyone we faced a serious problem. Resistance began to be reported in Gram-negative bacteria toward the newer cephalosporin, fluoroquinolone, and even the carbapenem drugs. During this same period we also witnessed the emergence and spread of a new healthcare associated infection called Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea as well as MRSA becoming pandemic. We now face a healthcare setting where as many as 70% of the bacterial infections afflicting our patients are resistant to at least one antimicrobial that was initially active againt their historical ancestors. Our objectives will be in the main area that describes our focus for this application, which is Antimicrobial Stewardship: Preventing the development and spread of resistant organisms in the healthcare setting. There are two specific aims for this research program to accomplish. They are:  1) Specific Aim 1: Complete development of the personalized weighted-incidence, syndromic,  combination antibiogram (WISCA) tool and validate its performance as a comprehensive strategy to  improve the treatment of infectious diseases for all hospitalized patiens.  - We will demonstrate and expand the use of information technology based on the WISCA for the  widespread use of automated clinician prompts enhancing empiric antibiotic therapy as part of a  comprehensive infection control stewardship program that reduces antibiotic resistance.  2) Specifi Aim 2: Demonstrate that use of such a tool improves outcome, lowers antimicrobial resistance  and reduces cost.  - The clinical and economic outcome measures will include changes in length of stay, duration of  treatment, use of therapeutic drug monitoring, inpatient mortality, adverse events fro  antibacterial therapy, admission and discharge location (with the goal being fewer persons  needing skilled care after discharge than is now required), 30 day readmission rates,  unintended consequences from antimicrobial agent use, such as Clostridium difficile infection,  antimicrobial rug cost and antimicrobial susceptibility. All our faculty are well aware of current developments in thir respective fields and are actively involved in cutting edge research that will be applied in a comprehensive, integrated fashion to solve the problem of antimicrobial resistant HAIs. We look forward to working on this Large Research Project with the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) in its mission to improve the quality, safety, efficiency, and effectiveness of healh care for all Americans."
"9391611","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):      Project Summary Objectives: This proposal is written in direct response to a specific request for new therapeutic directions for neurodegenerative disease (Alzheimer's) treatment as well as the development of new animal models of neurodegenerative disease useful for monitoring the effects of new therapies on the dementing process. We plan to test a well-characterized small molecule peptide fragment, JM4 synthesized from erythropoietin for long-term therapy in three transgenic mouse models of neurodegenerative disease. We believe that part of the progression in Alzheimer's disease is related to protracted inflammatory processes and that our newly discovered potent Immunomodulatory compound, JM4 that appears to work through downregulation of the innate immune system may be beneficial. Our compound may or may not attack a root cause of Alzheimer's disease but if secondary inflammation is critical to onset or progression in this disorder, then our compounds may be of long-term benefit. Specific aims S.A.1: Determine the therapeutic effect of our small EPO peptide on three animal models of neurodegenerative disease and/or AD with different clinical and pathologic characteristics. The drug will be tested against the triple transgenic AD mouse model, a more aggressive 5xFAD beta-amyloid model and early on in a third model (P301S) where tau-mediated pathology, microglial activation and hind limb paresis are prominent. The functional effects of long-term therapy will be assessed using PBS sham-treated animals as controls. (Neurobehavioral assessment, time to disease onset, Kaplan- Meier survival curve, drug effect on preventing both ventricular enlargement and hippocampal atrophy. We will also employ immunohistochemistry and flow cytometric assays for determining the effects of therapy on microglial/macrophage immunoreactivity using MHCII, Lectin, Iba1, CD11b, CD11c, F4/80, on neurons (NeuN) using monoclonal antibodies for phosphorylated tau (AT8), conformational specific tau antibody (MC1), synaptophysin, 6E10 for ¿-amyloid products and APP, and by ThioS staining). S.A. 2: Develop a refined animal model of dementia using both 5xFAD amyloid and P301S tau mice further encoded with an additional transgene specific for GFAP-luciferase. These enhanced neurodegenerative models can be followed long-term in single animals non-invasively from early childhood (asymptomatic) through disease onset to full-blown disease. Our pilot data indicates that the GFAP-luc/P301S tau animals will manifest markedly increased bioluminescence as they become symptomatic. Importantly, positive effects of therapy induced by our small JM4 EPO peptide, JM4 should be reflected by suppressed or greatly reduced bioluminescence when compared to bioluminescent levels in symptomatic sham treated animals. Controls for the bioluminescence studies will include immunohistochemistry for GFAP, Western Immunoblots for GFAP and RT-PCR of GFAP transcripts to control for message abundance and extent of bioluminescent signal. S.A. 3: In aged symptomatic 5xFAD or P301S tau animals, determine if interventional JM4 therapy (3 month) initiated at 6 or 9 months of age is as effective as chronic very long duration therapy in delaying onset or progression of the neurodegenerative process using the criteria enumerated in S.A. 1 and 2 (neurobehavioral, drug effect on degree of GFAP bioluminescence and immunohistochemical assessment). S.A. 4: Using IV administered radiolabeled JM4, determine JM4 blood-brain barrier permeability in normal mice (whole brain counts from post-perfused animals and as an alternate by microdialysis in hippocampus). Potential Impact on Veterans Health Care: There is a pressing need for a therapy for Alzheimer's disease where there is currently no effective treatment. The Alzheimer foundation states that if the dementing process could be slowed by 5 years, US health care costs for this condition would drop by 50%. lf this is true, the remarkable delays we have been observing in our novel compound (JM4) treated AD mice, while well short of a complete cure, could likely slow progression by 5 years or more. lf positive findings are consistently confirmed in the proposed animal studies, then it would be a clear cut indication that the immune response and its modulation in Alzheimer's are likely critical components of the puzzle, Our compounds appear to work like no other immunomodulating compounds described to date and we believe since it is a naturally occurring motif hidden within the human and animal EPO molecule, its efficacy will be favorable and side effect profile minimal."
"9449037","Abstract Short-term memory (STM) is a core cognitive function, critical for reasoning, decision-making, and flexible behavior. Though it has been recognized as a key function of interest for many decades, the critical neural substrate of STM is little understood. Recording experiments have found distributed persistent activity related to STM across multiple brain areas, yet it is unclear what the critical circuit nodes are, whether STM is supported by a single distributed circuit or involves many distinct parallel representations at the same time, and what if any are the causal relations between STM related activity in different brain areas. This gap in knowledge stems from lacks of a holistic view of the neural dynamics giving rise to STM. Comprehensive studies that examine multiple brain regions within a single STM behavior are severely lacking. Moreover, recordings alone cannot assess how signals across multiple brain regions are related to each other and to behavior. Transient perturbation is a powerful approach to probe recurrent neural networks. The response of neural dynamics following a transient perturbation are related to the network structure. The objective of this proposal is to use region-specific and temporally-precise perturbations in multiple brain regions to probe critical circuit nodes for STM. This will demonstrate the potential of our approach for identifying multi-regional circuits driving behavior and generate hypotheses regarding their network structure. We focus on a frontal cortical region (ALM) that is critical for a STM behavior we developed. Mice make a sensory discrimination, followed by a delay epoch in which they maintain a STM of their upcoming motor response. ALM neurons exhibit persistent activity that are causally related to the upcoming movement. STM neural dynamics are funneled through ALM projections to the brainstem to trigger a behavioral response. These properties make ALM an ideal entry point to read out the dynamics arising from the interactions of different circuit nodes and relate the dynamics to behavior. We will first obtain a comprehensive dataset where we transiently perturb all of the candidate brain regions for STM (identified using recordings and anatomy) while monitoring their consequences on STM dynamics in ALM with population recordings using the latest silicon probe technology (Aim1). We will then perform theoretical analysis of the perturbed dynamics leading to model classes that relate specific dynamics to behavior and serve as hypotheses for the underlying circuit structure (Aim2). If successful, this approach will identify the critical anatomical substrate and the relevant STM neural dynamics in a single behavior. The model outcome will subsequently guide a truly targeted yet comprehensive investigation of the multi-regional STM circuit."
"9343478","Intricate social hierarchies that go through both dynamic and stable phases exist in species ranging from humans to mice to insects and have been richly described in psychology and ecology, but virtually nothing is known about the neural circuit mechanisms that govern the remarkable coordination of large groups of animals. Systems neuroscience has exploded with a number of novel technologies, yet the culture of this field has been largely reductionist ? focusing on animals living in isolation or with a single-digit number of cage mates performing highly-controlled tasks. Although there is abundant ongoing research in the domain of social reward (motivation to engage in social behavior for hedonic value that social interaction provides), there is no ongoing research (to my knowledge) examining the neural representation of a negative valence need state (a loneliness-like state), the social homeostatic set-point, or how this is related to social rank. Indeed, this unexplored face of social behavior may have greater relevance to mental health and the burden on society. This proposal is completely different from any previous work done by myself or any investigator because we will do the following: 1) present a model for social homeostasis where social rank dictates the set-point for quality/quantity of social contact; 2) bridge behavioral ecology and systems neuroscience by using complex, naturalistic vivariums of large groups of mice in combination with nascent neural recording technology and expertise across a wide range of functional circuit dissection techniques; 3) simultaneously record across many brains using wireless recording devices to determine how composite dominance hierarchy is represented and determine whether meta-brain patterns for group social homeostasis (in both stable and dynamic phases) exist and observe how they change during dominance hierarchical reorganizations; and 4) identify site(s) and circuit(s) that represent social rank by applying machine learning approaches to decode ensembles that accurately predict the animal?s social rank, and use this information to move towards a mathematical model for social homeostasis on a supraorganismal group level."
"9355052","DESCRIPTION:      Pain management has been identified as a priority area in VA clinical care, and chronic back pain is a leading cause of disability for US veterans. The role in back pain of psychiatric disorders such as post- traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) has not been well studied in Veterans. For example, while there is a high co-occurrence of PTSD with chronic pain in Veterans, it remains unknown whether PTSD is a risk factor for the development of pain, or whether this co-occurrence is due to other factors such as shared familial predispositions. In addition, there have been no studies to date examining the genomics of back pain in Veterans. We propose a study of back pain in older Veterans who are members of the Vietnam Era Twin (VET) Registry. The Registry is comprised of 7369 male-male twin pairs, both of whom served in the military during the Vietnam conflict (1964-1975). We will capitalize on the rich data available in the Registry, and the recently completed study entitled, 'CSP 569: A Twin Study of the Course and Consequences of PTSD in Vietnam Era Veterans'. Our project consists of 3 interrelated components. First, we will analyze detailed information on PTSD and back pain from amongst the 7332 veterans who participated in CSP 569. Second, we will follow 171 MZ twin pairs who are discordant for PTSD symptoms, but are concordant for absence of back pain at baseline, for the occurrence of back pain. The longitudinal MZ co-twin design allows examination of the effect of an exposure while controlling for shared genetics and family environment. Third, we will conduct an epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) identifying differentially methylated regions (DMRs) associated with prevalent chronic back pain and back pain risk factors using recently acquired biospecimens from the VET Registry Biorepository. We will further cross-reference identified DMRs with existing databases of genes associated with known pain mechanisms, and conduct pathway analyses to identify specific biological networks which may be implicated in the production of pain. The candidate, Dr. Pradeep Suriyaarachchi, MD, MS is a physiatrist with subspecialty training in Pain Medicine and clinical expertise in back pain management. His career goal is to become an independent VA Investigator conducting epidemiologic research focused on the prevention of back pain, and improving function for Veterans with chronic back pain. His background is in clinical epidemiology, but he seeks to gain training in contemporary genetic epidemiology, genomics, and bioinformatics, in order to gain insights into the etiology of back pain, and to develop new interventions for back pain and related disability. He has assembled an outstanding mentorship team under the leadership of primary mentor Dr. Edward Boyko, MD, MPH. This mentorship team includes renowned experts in clinical epidemiology, genetic epidemiology, genomics, and bioinformatics, as well as the clinical domains of back pain and rehabilitation. The CDA-2 will allow Dr. Suriyaarachchi the structured coursework, mentorship, and applied learning needed to acquire new research skills in genetic epidemiology and genomics. Structured learning experiences will include formal coursework and seminars, regular local conferences, and attendance at scientific meetings. He will take advantage of key local resources to carry out the proposed research and training in the centers where his mentors are based, including the VA Seattle Epidemiologic Research and Information Center (where he is an investigator), the VET Registry, and the University of Washington's Department of Genome Sciences and Comparative Effectiveness, Cost, and Outcomes Research Center (which specializes in back pain research). This outstanding local environment will help ensure Dr. Suriyaarachchi's success."
"9383660","ABSTRACT  Eukaryotic cells are characterized by their exquisite compartmentalization. Membrane-bound organelles form highly dynamic and interconnected networks. This complexity makes a permanent crosstalk between the organelles a necessity for the coordination of cellular functions. The tight juxtaposition of membranes from different types of organelles is essential to the controlled exchanges of matter and information within cells and is mediated by various organelle-tethering protein complexes. Small metabolites and messengers such as phospholipids (PLs) and Ca2+ are exchanged at these membrane contact sites (MCSs). Understanding the molecular mechanisms that regulate interactions between organelles will offer new insights into this fundamental aspect of eukaryotic cell biology. Our research focuses on the Endoplasmic Reticulum- Mitochondrion Encounter Structure (ERMES), a tether identified in the model eukaryote organism yeast, and functioning at ER-mitochondrial junctions also named Mitochondrion-Associated Membranes (MAMs). While many groups investigate MCSs, most of them use approaches based on genetic screens and cellular imaging methods combined with proteomics or metabolomics. We bring to bear biochemical, biophysical and structural methods to characterize ERMES at the level of molecular structure to understand its precise cellular functions and mechanism of action. ERMES is composed of five subunits, but besides its subunit composition nothing else is known about its architecture and mode of assembly at MAMs. Three of these subunits, the ER- anchored protein Mmm1, the soluble subunit Mdm12, and the mitochondrial membrane protein Mdm34, contain a SMP domain, a lipid-binding protein domain exclusively found in proteins located at MCSs from yeast to humans. Using mass-spectrometry, we showed that Mdm12 preferentially binds phosphatidylcholines while our 17-Å resolution negative-stain EM structure of the Mmm1/Mdm12 hetero-tetramer revealed that the soluble SMP domains not only bind phospholipids but also function as specific protein scaffolds to assemble the tether. This led us to propose a first and very rudimentary structural model for the ERMES-mediated exchange of PLs at MAMs. The lack of a biochemically tractable system reconstituted in vitro has hindered efforts to definitely establish the function(s) of ERMES. Here, we propose to complete the reconstitution of ERMES to characterize its subunit stoichiometry and identify its bona-fide lipid ligands. Using purified subunits we will reconstitute the SMP-core of ERMES on two distinctly labeled types of proteoliposomes and assess tethering and PL exchange using fluorescence-based biophysical methods in vitro. With this system, we will also dissect the mechanisms of ERMES regulation by the tail-anchored mitochondrial GTPase Gem1, an integral ERMES subunit that was shown to control tether assembly and lipid exchange. Last, we will determine the structure of ERMES by a `hybrid' approach combining single particle high-resolution cryo-EM analysis to improve the resolution of our current reconstructions, and X-ray diffraction analysis of recently obtained crystals of complex."

In doing so, AzPRC goals and objectives will carry forward existing efforts of AzPRC personnel and partners to further the National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion's mission to support people and communities in preventing chronic disease and promoting health for all, specifically through our efforts to: 1) integrating evidence-based strategies across health systems; 2) working with public health systems to apply and evaluate policy, systems & environmental change (PSE) efforts designed to create healthy places for people to work, learn and play; and 3) improving community-clinical linkages to ensure access to, and quality of, culturally relevant prevention and promotion efforts. Over the next five years the AzPRC will work with the Arizona Department of Health Services, County Health Departments, Federally Qualified Health Centers and other community organizations to improve the health and wellbeing of communities on the Arizona-Sonora Border and statewide. The AzPRC will achieve this goal through the integrated impact of efforts in infrastructure, community engagement, partnering and technical assistance; communication and dissemination, training, and evaluation. The AzPRC, using state of the art and efficient methodologies, will also execute a rigorous practice- based Public Health research project that will identify evidence-based guidelines for Community Health Worker (CHW) practices to address chronic disease and interrelated mental health needs, and translate these findings into an implemented and evaluated CHW-delivered preventive program model linking primary care settings dedicated to reaching the under-served with community services of county health departments. In the latter stages of this research, guiding by our prior successful statewide public health system-based efforts and being responsive to evolving reimbursement mechanism of CHWs promoted by the Affordable Care Act and other policy efforts, the sustainability and scalable of this program throughout the State will be focal."
"9296607","SUMMARY Multiple studies using different methodologies have found that compared to non-Hispanic whites (NHWs), Hispanic women who are survivors of breast cancer are more likely to report impairments in health-related quality of life (hr-QOL) attributable to emotional functioning (increased depression and distress), physical functioning (fatigue), and social functioning. This increased survivorship burden or the combination of different hr-QOL domains has been found to exist even when controlling for cancer treatment factors. Evidence suggests that socioeconomic factors, socio-cultural factors, and inflammation may be involved in the survivorship burden. With respect to the latter, the PI and others have shown that inflammation is associated with the severity of depression and fatigue in NHW breast cancer survivors. Stress-based theories of health suggest that in addition to socioeconomic factors, socio-cultural factors are also important for understanding the survivorship burden. These include acculturation and acculturation stress, social status, stigmatization, social support, and familism. Low acculturation has been associated with poor emotional functioning in Hispanic breast cancer survivors. Interestingly, acculturation stress has also been linked to increased inflammation in other racial groups, suggesting that stress related to socio-cultural factors may impact the biology of hr-QOL impairments in Hispanic breast cancer survivors. Connections between stress and inflammation involved with the survivorship burden have been studied using short-term psychological stress challenges in the laboratory. Specifically, exaggerated inflammation responsiveness to short-term laboratory stress has been found in individuals of low socioeconomic status, suggesting that stress in the laboratory may reveal unique aspects of the pathophysiology of hr-QOL impairments not otherwise apparent at rest. The PI and others have used similar procedures (the Trier Social Stress Test [TSST]), to reveal increased inflammation in individuals with depression. The overarching goal of this proposal is to determine if hr- QOL impairments experienced by Hispanic breast cancer survivors are associated with stress- associated inflammation in a manner that involves socio-cultural factors. Accordingly, the current proposal features two specific aims. First, the study will work to determine if inflammation in response to short- term psychological stress challenge in the laboratory with the TSST predicts hr-QOL disparities experienced by Hispanic compared to non-Hispanic white breast cancer survivors. And second, the study will explore the relationships among stress-related inflammation and socio-cultural factors to predict hr-QOL disparities experienced by Hispanic breast cancer survivors. Accomplishment of these aims will provide critical insight into the likely stress pathophysiological mechanisms of inflammation and socio-cultural factors involved in the survivorship burden experienced by Hispanic breast cancer survivors, and may eventually result in novel risk screening strategies and interventions for this important and underserved group."
"9454009","7. Project Summary/Abstract Opioid receptors (ORs), consisting of ?-, ?-, and ?-ORs, are neuropeptide receptors that are broadly involved in regulating analgesia, mood, reward, and motor coordination. Opioid signaling is correspondingly implicated in a variety of behavioral disorders, including depression, drug addiction, stress, and dyskinesia. Understanding how OR circuit activity influences behavior is therefore critical to developing better treatments for disorders such as depression and addiction. Since these neural circuits are deeply embedded together in the brain at high density, very high resolution tools are needed for modulating and studying individual circuits in detail. Current high resolution optical methods for dissecting neuronal circuits are limited to altering membrane ion gradients. However, neuropeptide receptors, including ORs, are G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) that trigger multiple biochemical signaling cascades inside the cell when activated. These signaling cascades affect diverse processes in the neuron from membrane potential and firing rates to DNA transcription and growth. Thus, a critical barrier to understanding OR signaling is the lack of high-resolution tools that can fully replicate both membrane electrophysiological and biochemical consequences of OR activation. The Avena sativa Light, Oxygen, Voltage sensing domain 2 (LOV2) is an optogenetic platform that has been successfully utilized to photoregulate interactions between peptides and their partners by fusing peptides to LOV2 in a way that couples the peptide binding reaction to a light-dependent conformational change in LOV2. This LOV2-peptide caging strategy will be used in this proposal to overcome the current barriers to opioid signaling research through the following specific aims: 1) develop a screening platform for the rapid design of LOV2-based optogenetic opioid peptide modulators, and 2) develop a LOV2-opioid peptide (LOV-OP) fusion protein capable of light-dependent activation of ORs in cell culture and brain slice models. OR activation by LOV-OP proteins will be evaluated in Aim 1 using a high-throughput GPCR cAMP activation assay. Aim 2 will optimize a LOV-OP protein to show light-dependent OR activation via mutagenesis, creating a high resolution tool for studying OR activation. Electrophysiological measurements of light-dependent depression of neuron firing by ORs activated by LOV-OP will validate LOV-OP function in primary neuron culture and brain slice. The broad, long-term objectives of this proposal are to enable high spatiotemporal resolution studies of opioid peptide activity in the brain that lead to breakthroughs in the understanding of how specific opioid peptidergic circuits contribute to cognition and behavioral disorders. The high-throughput screening methods developed in the proposal can also be rapidly extended to studying circuits of other neuropeptides in the brain."
"9470553","Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is the leading cause of death and disability for people <45 years of age, accounting for nearly 30% of all injury-related fatalities. An estimated 5.3 million Americans are currently living with long-term TBI-related disability. Severe injuries can increase the risk of complications that further compound injury severity. Indeed, TBI patients are considered to be at high risk for infection. Nearly 50% of all TBI patients will develop a secondary infection in the hospital setting. The infection-related mortality rate for TBI patients is ~30%, disproportionately higher than stroke or burn injury, further underscoring the importance of the bidirectional communication between the brain and the immune system. The events that lead to post-TBI immune paralysis are rarely modeled, and as a result, our understanding of the cellular mechanisms underlying the increased vulnerability to infection remains poor. Moreover, the long-term consequences of TBI on systemic immunity are unknown. The dearth of experimental data and lack of long-term patient follow-up studies means that the potential for TBI to permanently alter microglia/macrophage behavior remains an open question. Previously published data from our laboratory has shown that TBI drives progressive neurodegenerative changes due to chronic microglial activation. New preliminary data suggests that TBI induces a persistent immune dysfunction that simulates age-related senescence as evidenced by chronic microglial dystrophy and impaired macrophage responses to secondary immune challenges. At the cellular level, these include deficits in lysosomal function, phagocytosis and respiratory burst activity, as well as elevated cytokine production and oxidative stress. In this proposal we will determine whether TBI causes injury-induced microglia/macrophage senescence, permanent immune dysfunction, and if the targeted removal of senescent cells in TBI mice improves functional outcomes. Aim 1 will characterize the functional properties and senescent signature of microglia and bone marrow (BM)-derived macrophages isolated from young TBI mice at chronic timepoints compared to sham and aged controls. Aim 2 will determine whether post-TBI changes in macrophage function are epigenetically driven, and will determine the functional effect that chronically altered BM cells have on CNS behavior using BM chimeras. Aim 3 will employ the senolytic drug Navitoclax (ABT263) for proof- of-principle of a therapeutic strategy to treat the chronic effects of TBI. The overall goal of this proposal is to identify key hallmarks of TBI-induced immune paralysis, and investigate mechanisms underlying chronic microglia/macrophage dysfunction in TBI. Targeted elimination of senescent immune cells may offer a novel therapeutic approach to restore beneficial properties of the inflammatory response and enhance functional recovery after TBI."
"9291950","Background Intimate partner violence (IPV) is a major health concern for women Veterans. IPV is associated with numerous physical and mental health conditions. VHA is implementing IPV screening programs to identify female patients who experience past-year IPV. Despite strong evidence that screening increases detection of IPV, less is established about how to intervene following IPV disclosure in health care settings, in order to improve health outcomes. Existing healthcare- based interventions result in minimal effects on health and well-being, likely because they are too brief and generic. In response, the PI has developed Recovering from IPV through Strengths and Empowerment (RISE), based on the IPV-related health care needs and preferences of women Veterans. RISE is designed to be delivered in primary care and is an individualized, variable-length, modular-based intervention that addresses 1) safety planning; 2) education on the health effects of IPV; 3) increasing coping skills and self-care; 4) enhancing social support; 5) making difficult decisions; and 6) connecting with resources. Objectives The objective of this proposal is to refine and formally evaluate RISE for women Veterans who experience IPV. The aims are to: 1) tailor and refine RISE to accommodate differences in service structures and personnel in different primary care settings; 2) conduct a formative evaluation of RISE with women Veterans to inform the development of a user-friendly, tailored implementation protocol and intervention manual; and 3) examine the effects of RISE on women Veterans? individual psychosocial outcomes. Methods We will conduct the proposed research at two Women?s Health Practice-Based Research Network sites (Boston, MA and West Haven, CT). For Aim 1, we will tailor and refine RISE through input from a Stakeholder Advisory Board, focus groups with Women Veterans (n=24- 32), and interviews with providers (n=24). To achieve Aim 2, we will conduct a formative open trial of RISE (n=up to 20 women Veterans). Qualitative and quantitative findings from patients and providers will inform the development of a user-friendly, tailored implementation protocol and intervention manual. For Aim 3, we will conduct a Hybrid 1 randomized clinical trial (n=60) to examine the effects of RISE on women Veterans? psychosocial outcomes (e.g., empowerment, self-efficacy, health, and service use). Anticipated Impacts on Veteran?s Health Care VHA?s Blueprint for Excellence identifies patient-centeredness and ?advancing innovations in women Veterans? health care? as key strategic transformational strategies. This project will help achieve these aims by evaluating a patient-centered IPV intervention that is tailored to women Veterans? needs, preferences, and circumstances. It is imperative to complement current VHA IPV screening efforts with an effective intervention. RISE fills an essential unmet need in our healthcare system, ensuring that women Veterans who experience IPV receive care that leads to improved health and psychosocial outcomes."
"9253568","ABSTRACT Traditional mon-therapeutic, target driven approaches to drug development for Alzheimer?s disease (AD) are becoming increasingly expensive and in many cases disappointingly unsuccessful. Based on preliminary in vitro and in vivo studies we have identified a novel small molecule (methyl 2,4-dimethyl-5-oxo-5,6-dihydrobenzo[c][2,7]naphthyridine-1-carboxylate; (BNC-1)) that significantly decreases neuroinflammation and production of A?42 in mouse models of AD pathology through Elk-1 mediated transcriptional repression of presenilin-1 but not presenilin-2. Although our preliminary data show BNC-1 effectively modulates 2 of the main pathologic features of AD without the adverse effects associated with current mono- therapeutics, there is a need for characterization of its basic pharmacology/toxicity and for identification of the most efficacious treatment regimen in a well characterized mouse model of A? deposition and neuroinflammation (5X FAD mice). If successful, the data obtained in this proposal will provide necessary pharmacology/safety toxicology data to de-risk the drug for potential corporate partners thus increasing the likelihood of successful commercialization."

The SPDN will support the Dissemination and Policy Core in the advertisement of DRDC/NCBDDD research and other funding opportunities, and in providing expertise and support for the many activities of the Coordinating Center. The DRDC has demonstrated both efficiency and flexibility in the solicitation and management of research projects, during the past 4½ years, in order to adapt to the changing needs of the NCBDDD. Over the next five-year period we hope to continue to support NCBDDD's agenda through the funding of research and systematic approaches to translate research to practice, for public health and medical professionals and to increase scientific and public awareness about these issues."
"9397621","ABSTRACT  Talin is a key component in the intracellular complex of proteins linking the extracellular martrix to the actin cytoskeleton via integrins at the plasma membrane. Talin interacts with ?-integrin tails and actin to control integrin activation and force generation. It also binds to phosphatidylinositol 4 phosphate 5-kinase type I ? 90 (PIPKI?90), an enzyme that catalyzes the production of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2), and regulates vesicle trafficking. In this capacity, talin regulates focal adhesion dynamics, force generation and invadopodium stability, thus governing cell migration and invasion. There are two talin genes, Tln1 and Tln2, which encode talin1 and talin2; talin1 has been well studied and it is generally believed that talin2 functions redundantly with talin1. However, our preliminary data reveal some important differences between talin 1 and 2. Specifically, talin2 has stronger binding to ? integrin tails than talin1 and Ser339 of talin2 is largely responsible for this affinity difference. Intriguingly, a new study shows that Fifth Finger Camptodactyly, a human genetic disease, is caused by a Leu mutation at talin2 Ser339, suggesting that the talin2-integrin interaction may be important for development. Talin2 is localized at invadopodia and is indispensable for traction force generation and invadopodium maturation. And, ablation of talin2 but not talin1 abolished the secretion of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) 1 and 9. In this regard, talin2 promotes PIPKI?90 binding to Exo84 (a component of the exocyst involved in vesicle secretion) and interacts with non-muscle myosin IIA (NMMIIA), a major myosin involved in traction force generation. Based on these data, our central hypothesis is that talin2 interacts with NMMIIA to mediate traction force generation and promotes PIPKI?90-Exo84 complex formation, thus driving MMP1 and MMP9 secretion, invadopodium maturation and cell invasion. We will test this hypothesis by addressing the following SPECIFIC AIMS: 1) define how talin2 regulates MMP secretion, invadopodium maturation and cell invasion; 2) dissect how talin2 modulates PIPKI?90-Exo84 interaction to regulate MMP secretion, invadopodium maturation and cell invasion; 3) determine how talin2 interacts with NMMIIA to regulate traction force generation, MMP secretion, invadopodium maturation and cell invasion. Our proposed studies are designed to uncover a novel, fundamental role for talin2 in regulating MMP secretion, invadopodium maturation and cancer cell invasion and the underlying mechanisms. Support for this connection is provided by the fact that talin2 was found to be down-regulated by Trastuzumab, a HER2-targeting antibody drug for breast cancers and our findings indicate that talin2 is essential to the traction force development required for invadopodium maturation and cell invasion. Thus, talin2 could be a target for therapies designed to inhibit the first steps of metastasis."
"9352301","PROJECT SUMMARY Surgical spending accounts for 30% of national health spending and is growing more rapidly than spending in other key healthcare sectors. Many hope that payment reforms included in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act will help curtail such spending growth. Chief among these reforms were provisions for establishing accountable care organizations (ACOs). By encouraging deeper health system integration and greater financial stewardship, proponents believe that ACOs will enhance care coordination and reduce the use of unnecessary services, ultimately improving quality and lowering health spending. However, the net effects of ACOs on surgical care remain unclear. On the one hand, ACOs incentives may motivate clinicians to consider cheaper alternatives to surgery in pursuit of lower population expenditures. On the other hand, shared saving agreements could have unintended consequences. For example primary care providers (PCPs) with ACO contracts may place too much emphasis on surgeons' costs, ignoring their quality, when making referral decisions. Moreover, economic pressures may lead surgeons, who rely on ACO PCPs for a steady stream of patients, to withhold costly but valuable care. In addition, important contextual factors may moderate ACO effects. For instance, ACOs frequently do not encompass surgeon practices and ambulatory surgery centers, where a growing share of surgical care is delivered. If these surgical providers are weakly connected to the PCP groups accepting collective accountability, ACOs' influence on them may be attenuated. In this context, we propose a study to better understand the impact that ACOs have on surgical care. Our proposal has the following three Specific Aims. To determine the impact that ACOs have on surgical spending and quality. Using the national Medicare population, we will identify eligible beneficiaries aligned with a Medicare ACO and those that are not. We will then compare surgical and overall expenditures among these beneficiaries before and after ACO formation. For beneficiaries who undergo surgery, we will also assess their perioperative outcomes and total episode payments. Aim 2: To evaluate for clinical heterogeneity in ACO effects on surgical care delivery. We will identify subsets of Medicare beneficiaries from Aim 1 with one of six conditions for which surgery is considered a treatment. We will then evaluate for differences in surgical spending on higher, intermediate, and lower value surgical procedures among these beneficiaries before and after ACO formation. Aim 3: To assess how heterogeneity in policy implementation affects surgical care delivery. Using linked data from the National Survey of Accountable Care Organizations and network analytical tools, we will assess how financial risk and organizational structure (including surgeon participation) moderate ACO effectiveness. Findings from our study will be directly relevant to the Agency for Healthcare Research & Quality's Research Priority Area #3, as they will inform decision makers at the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services about the effects of new reimbursement mechanisms on health spending."
"9357525","Project Summary/Abstract This is a revised submission for an AHRQ Mentored Clinical Scientist Research Career Development Award (K08) by Christine D. Jones, MD, MS. My overall career goal is to develop and implement interventions that improve patient outcomes through more effective care coordination between clinicians. Care transitions from hospital to home can be perilous for patients, and fragmented communication contributes to many preventable adverse events during this transition. Home health care (HHC) is increasingly employed with the intent to improve care transitions, but even with home support, older adults remain vulnerable to adverse events after discharge, including hospital readmissions, which contribute to progressive disability for these patients. With this career development award, I will develop an intervention that improves care coordination between hospitalists and HHC nurses that aims to reduce adverse patient outcomes, including medication errors and hospital readmissions. Candidate and Mentors: I am an Assistant Professor of Medicine at the University of Colorado where I practice as an adult medicine hospitalist. I completed a research fellowship and have conducted studies to describe barriers to care coordination, a systematic review of interventions to reduce readmissions, and analyses of HHC referrals at hospital discharge. I have built productive relationships with my mentors and have completed two manuscripts ? one published, one in press - with my primary mentor, Dr. Frederick Masoudi. Research and Training: I will build on my prior research through three complementary research and training aims that will inform an intervention to improve the quality of care coordination between hospitalists and HHC nurses caring for older adults after acute hospitalization. I will: (1) employ qualitative methods to understand HHC nurse, patient, and caregiver experiences of care coordination, (2) generate predictive models to identify modifiable risk factors for 30-day readmissions from HHC within national Medicare data, and (3) develop, implement, and evaluate a pilot intervention to connect hospitalists and HHC nurses to optimize post-discharge care coordination and reduce adverse patient outcomes. At award completion, I will have the training and skills to be a successful independent investigator and will pursue funding for a pragmatic clinical trial to test the effectiveness of an intervention to improve care coordination between hospitalists and HHC nurses. Summary: Effective care coordination between hospitalists and HHC nurses is critical to support high-quality care transitions for vulnerable patients after acute hospitalization. The proposed research will inform an intervention to improve care coordination between hospitalists and HHC nurses and enhance outcomes for patients receiving HHC services after hospitalization. This award will support my development into an independent investigator with expertise in enhancing care coordination between clinicians to improve outcomes for the growing number of patients discharged with HHC services."
"9440295","Project Summary/Abstract Fifty percent of A. baumannii isolates from US ICUs are extreme drug resistant (XDR), far higher than for other pathogens. These infections result in ?10,000 and 30,000 deaths and excess healthcare costs of $390 million and $742 million in the US and globally, annually. Furthermore, in contrast to other resistant bacteria, virtually no antibiotics are in the pipeline to deal with XDR A. baumannii. New treatments are critically needed.  We established two MAbs, C8 and 39, that collectively bind to 90% of the 62 clinical isolates of A. baumannii tested. We have found efficacy in lethal murine models of XDR A. baumannii bacteremic sepsis and aspiration pneumonia, the two most common sites of A. baumannii infection. Furthermore, C8 exhibits substantial synergy with colistin during delayed therapy for lethal A. baumannii infection (39 is not yet tested). Other MAbs have also been raised that are not yet characterized. We will define an optimal mixture of MAbs to target strains broadly, and define mechanisms of protection to support future humanization and clinical trials. Specific Aim 1: Define optimal MAbs with respect to surface binding and in vitro killing of multiple clinical isolates of A. baumannii. We will define surface binding of the MAbs vs. isotype controls to broadly diverse clinical isolates of A. baumannii. We will also identify the mechanism of bacterial clearance by the MAbs, the potential for and frequency of bacterial escape mutants, and the impact of MAbs on antibiotic susceptibility. Finally, we will establish the antigenic targets of the MAbs. Specific Aim 2: Define the in vivo effects of the optimal MAbs in 3 models of infection and against multiple strains of A. baumannii, with and without antibiotics. We will compare in vivo efficacy of single vs. combination MAbs vs. isotype control during delayed therapy in 3 well-established models of infection; mouse bacteremic sepsis, mouse pneumonia, and rat wound infection. We will evauate for anti-MAb antibodies in rats. We will then determine how early prior to infection MAb prophylaxis is effective, and how long post-infection MAb therapy remains effective, and the impact of multiple doses of MAbs during prolonged therapy. Finally, we will define interactions between MAbs and antibacterial therapy in each model. Specific Aim 3: Define the mechanisms of protection of optimal MAb passive vaccination. We will define the in vivo mechanisms of efficacy by treating with optimal MAb vs. isotype control in wild-type vs. mice with selective depletion of host effectors (e.g., complement, macrophages, neutrophils, and activating Fc?R vs. inhibitory Fc?RII). Outcome measures will include survival, bacterial density, and inflammation. These results will inform future efforts to optimize the efficacy of humanized MAbs, and identify surrogate efficacy assays. Novel solutions for A. baumannii infections are a critical unmet need. We will identify an optimal MAb regimen protective across multiple sites of infection (blood, lung, soft tissue), define in vitro correlates of protection, and determine the mechanisms of protection, which will enable future efficacy optimization of humanized MAbs."
"9393088","ABSTRACT Chronic cardiometabolic (CM) diseases such as hypertension and type 2 diabetes (T2DM) contribute disproportionately to global morbidity and mortality, and are increasing believed to have multiple environmental influences. In the previous 5 years of this competitive renewal (AIRCMD), we executed a multinational collaborative in an environment with high levels of air pollution exposure and demonstrated that short-term exposure to black carbon and PM2.5 results in elevations in blood pressure (BP) and insulin sensitivity through sympathetic nervous system (SNS) mechanisms. Given the fact that improvements in air quality are decades away in countries like China and India and that prevailing low levels of air pollution in the United States preclude the ability of US based studies to demonstrate a meaningful effect, the efficacy of personal- intervention is best performed in relevant countries (e.g., China) where ambient levels are high, and the public is likely to derive benefit. In this competing renewal, we propose a high impact interventional study that will test the efficacy of personal intervention strategies to mitigate PM2.5-induced adverse cardiometabolic effects in environments with high levels of ambient exposures. The use of ?simple? facemasks (N95) to reduce air pollution exposure is widespread across regions experiencing high air pollution levels, and is commonly adopted by visitors to these environments. In Aim 1, as part of a randomized crossover study of 100 adults with metabolic syndrome, we will demonstrate the impact of a simple facemask (FM) intervention while outdoors on cardio-metabolic outcomes (primary endpoints: 24-hour ambulatory systolic blood pressure [ASBP] and insulin resistance (IR) by fasting homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance [HOMA-IR]) compared to control (no facemask). Secondary end-points will include automated resting SBP, SNS activity (time and frequency domain heart rate variability [HRV]), and central aortic BP. In Aim 2, whether in-home air purifier system with HEPA filters [APHF]) in conjunction with a FM compared to a sham filtration arm and no FM leads to improvements in the same cardio-metabolic outcomes, in a double-blinded cross-over study will be carried out. In an exploratory Aim 3 we will elucidate the potential pathways of benefit using circulating adipokines, oral glucose tolerance testing with and without a safe stable isotope [13C-labeled oral glucose] to provide new insights on pathways of benefit. Collectively, the results from this project are likely to provide critical new data on protective effects of personal intervention strategies."
"9547634","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Alcoholism and alcohol use disorders represent a major public health problem, and are associated with devastating social and economic burdens. Despite active research and development of pharmacotherapies for the treatment of alcoholism, FDA-approved medications are often insufficient in sustaining long-term abstinence in treatment-seeking individuals. This stark reality is made clear by the fact that upwards of 90% of alcoholics relapse at least once over a four year period following treatment onset. The purpose of this project is to establish a new paradigm for the treatment of alcoholism and alcohol use disorders; one that site- specifically targets a neuro-regenerative process, reverses dependence-associated deficits in reward pathway function, circumvents the reliance on protracted patient compliance, and exhibits a permanent effect once introduced. We believe that gene therapy that culminates in the overexpression of glial-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) within the ventral tegmental area (VTA), a key component of the reward neurocircuitry, is such a treatment paradigm. Preliminary work conducted in rodents indicated that elevated expression of intra-VTA GDNF blocks the escalation of alcohol drinking in naive animals and significantly attenuates excessive drinking in alcohol-experienced animals whereas suppression of endogenous GDNF in the VTA enhances the progression to heavy alcohol use. A crucial next step in advancing the translation application of this treatment paradigm to human alcoholics is to first demonstrate that a similar intervention in non-human primates (NHPs) will yield a comparable benefit in reducing relapse risk. Aim 1 of this project will establish heavy alcohol self- administration in a cohort of male cynomolgus monkeys during a 6-month open access period. These methods have been validated and replicated for over a decade, with monkeys developing binge-like drinking patterns of alcohol use that resemble those observed in human alcoholics. Aim 2 will evaluate the efficacy of GDNF gene therapy in preventing relapse and the continuation of heavy drinking. An adeno-associated virus serotype 2 (AAV2)-GDNF or control vector will be bilaterally infused into the VTA of each monkey following a 1-month period of abstinence, and alcohol will be re-introduced under open access conditions and self- administration patterns will be monitored during multiple withdrawal-relapse cycles. We hypothesize that AAV2-GDNF treatment will prevent relapse-like drinking patterns and reduce the number of heavy drinking days by attenuating the incidence of binges (large bout sizes) that produce intoxicating blood alcohol concentrations. In summary, we believe this will be a transformative approach for the treatment of alcoholism that may also be applicable for the treatment of other life-threatening addictions. If successful, then our in-life data will be includd in a briefing package to the U.S. Food & Drug Administration in order to advance this candidate therapeutic through an Investigation New Drug (IND) submission for future clinical testing."
"9356490","PROJECT SUMMARY Owing to the heightened risk of medication errors during patient care transitions, the ?meaningful use? of the EHR Medication Reconciliation functionality, has potential to significantly improve quality & patient safety, and reduce healthcare costs. Despite the federal policy impetus towards EHR Medication Reconciliation however, hospital adherence has lagged for one chief reason?low physician engagement?which in part, stems from lack of professional consensus about which physician is responsible for managing a patient's medication list and the value of medication reconciliation as a clinical tool for improving quality of care.  GR Health has recently launched certified EHR technology throughout its health system. Like many hospitals, a key challenge faced by GR Health is that physicians who did not place the original order for a patient's medication, are resistant to completing EHR Medication Reconciliation at discharge, leading to frustrated patients with incomplete medication lists and higher-than-expected medication error rates.  This pilot/feasibility project seeks to implement a Social Knowledge Networking (SKN) system to enable GR Health to progress from ?limited use? of EHR Medication Reconciliation technology, to ?meaningful use.? Step 1 (Development Phase) will be to enhance an existing SKN system (Microsoft-Yammer's) capability to promote EHR medication reconciliation; and integrate the tool into the EHR workflow at GR Health. Step 2 (Pilot Phase) will be to conduct a pilot/feasibility test of the SKN system in the outpatient & inpatient settings at GR Health. Specific aims are to examine: 1) user-engagement in the SKN system through SKN user surveys & SKN usage analytics; and 2) preliminary associations between ?SKN use? and ?EHR meaningful use.?  The rationale is that an SKN system would bring together a diverse group of practitioners (physicians, nurses, pharmacists, IT specialists, and administrators), to facilitate the exchange of tacit knowledge (practice- based knowledge) on the problem of interest. Tacit knowledge exchange in turn, is expected to increase practitioners' engagement in solving the problem, promote learning, and enable practice change (i.e., EHR meaningful use). The pilot study would include 6 SKN Moderators (senior administrators & MD champions) and 60 SKN Users (practitioners) from the outpatient & inpatient medicine service. The hypothesis is that proactive, periodic ?top-down? efforts of SKN Moderators to promote EHR Medication Reconciliation would synergize with ?bottom-up? exchange of tacit knowledge by SKN Users, to enable engagement, learning, and meaningful use.  The project is highly responsive to the FOA, since it seeks to test a strategy for health IT use, implementation, and design, which in turn is aligned with three of AHRQ's five health IT research priorities. If the hypothesis holds, federal EHR vendors could be encouraged to incorporate SKN features into EHR systems. The study will utilize a range of quantitative, qualitative, and social network analytic techniques to examine SKN user engagement, SKN usability, SKN usage analytics, and EHR meaningful use."
"9565688","Abstract Early-life disadvantage impedes normal developmental trajectories and confers elevated risk for poor health, personal, and financial consequences that are particularly pronounced for individuals in mid-life. This is a significant public health issue in impoverished communities that disproportionately suffer aging-related negative outcomes. Unfortunately, current interventions target single primary clinical outcomes rather than a target mechanism of various aging-related consequences, and are thus limited. This competing renewal application seeks to leverage (1) the work completed during the initial funding period and (2) new relationships established with community partners in the underserved communities of Baltimore, MD to continue and expand a project targeting elevated delay discounting (DD), a core mechanism for negative consequences in mid-life. Indicative of exaggerated preference for immediate rewards, elevated DD is associated with a wide spectrum of health-compromising behaviors and negative outcomes observed in mid-life of individuals with early-life disadvantage. Using a computerized executive function (EF) training intervention in a context of a Phase-II RCT design, this proposal seeks to experimentally examine changes in EF and DD in a sample of mid-life individuals who have experienced early-life disadvantage. Primary Aims are to examine initial and maintained (3-month and 6-month) effects of EF training on both EF and DD, in comparison to a matched control training condition and a no training condition. We expect EF improvement and reductions in DD immediately and at 3-months and 6-months following the active training condition but not in the control or no training conditions. We will examine whether improvement in EF is a mechanism of intervention effects on DD. We expect that reductions in DD will be mediated by improvement in EF. An exploratory aim is examination of whether the active training condition improves health behaviors and outcomes. The proposed research may illuminate an innovative approach that may be particularly applicable to impoverished communities and broadly impact the health and wellness of mid-life individuals with increased risk for poor consequences due to early-life disadvantage."
"9350321","PROJECT SUMMARY The UNAIDS 90-90-90 goals for 2020 represents an ambitious strategy to end the AIDS epidemic. The third target envisions 90% of all patients receiving antiretroviral therapy to be virally suppressed. In 2013, WHO recommended the transition to viral load (VL) monitoring for all patients on ART for more than 6 months and at least at 12-month intervals thereafter. While VL testing is the gold standard of HIV treatment monitoring, it is not routinely available and employed in low and middle-income countries (LMICs). WHO estimates that only 20% of patients on ART were receiving VL testing in most LMICs. Nigeria, with a population of 180 million, has the second highest burden of HIV in the world. As of 2014, 747.382 Nigerians were on ART, with just under 50% coverage of those considered eligible for treatment. With only 25 VL instruments in the country, it is clear that additional VL capacity is required and we believe that at least some of this need could be rationally filled with the use of point of care (POC) VL technology. . This proposal seeks to optimize VL monitoring in response to objective 6 of this RFA. We propose a randomized control trial of the Simple Amplification-Based Assay (SAMBA) semi-quantitative (SQ) monitoring versus standard of care (SOC) VL monitoring in patients newly initiating ART. We have recently demonstrated excellent performance of the Simple Amplification-Based Assay (SAMBA) semi- quantitative (SQ) HIV-1 VL test, which has the added benefit of providing results in 90 minutes from a finger prick blood sample, in Nigeria. We hypothesize that use of a POC VL will result in increased viral suppression rates as well as improved adherence and retention rates for patients on ART. A tertiary teaching hospital in North-Central Nigeria, Jos University Teaching Hospital, and a secondary district hospital, Comprehensive Health Centre, Zamko, that currently accesses VL monitoring through a networked approach are our proposed trial sites. The specific aims of the proposed project are to:  1. Compare the 12-month outcomes of patients monitored with POC VL versus SOC VL  2. Compare the retention and adherence rates in patients monitored with POC VL versus SOC VL, with a  sub-aim of comparing drug resistant mutation patterns in patients that fail 1L ART by month 12 of treatment.  3. Determine the acceptability and feasibility of implementing POC VL monitoring The proposed trial will provide the first evaluation of a POC VL monitoring program in a relevant ART setting, the results will help inform priorities for the implementation of POC VL in Nigeria and other LMICs."
"9346992","The long-term goal of this project is to develop an improved ERT for MPS I patients with innovations that enhance ERT delivery and disease correction in hard to treat organs such as the brain while integrating safety and cost advantages of plant-based bioproduction. MPS I Syndrome is caused by genetic deficiencies in the lysosomal enzyme ?-L-iduronidase (IDUA). While current ERT drug options for MPS I effectively treat many visceral organs, significant debilitating manifestations of this disease in the central nervous system (CNS) remain to be addressed. Previous cellular studies by BioStrategies showed that this lectin, which has high affinity for glycoproteins and glycolipids common on mammalian cell surfaces, can mediate efficient cellular uptake, transcytosis, and delivery of IDUA to lysosomes. In vitro analyses of MPS I patient fibroblasts treated with our IDUA-Lectin fusion (termed IDUAL) demonstrated rapid and efficient correction of cellular disease phenotypes. Our Phase I feasibility animal studies on this project have shown that IDUAL could be delivered to the brains of MPS I mouse model animals yielding correction of both cellular and behavioral phenotypes of this disease and achieving the milestone objectives of the Phase I study. Specific aims for this follow-up Phase II proposal are 1) Assess in vivo drug dosage levels, frequency, and CNS drug delivery and efficacy readouts in MPS I mice, 2) Develop IDUAL product scale-up, stability, and qualification protocols to support advanced preclinical studies, and 3) Establish rigorous preclinical animal data assessing efficacy, age at treatment onset, immunogenicity, gender effects, and behavioral correction following long-term IDUAL administration. Achievement of phase I goals of this project showing in vivo cellular and behavioral animal efficacy of IDUAL has provided a critical proof-of-concept for our lectin carrier ERT fusion drug delivery technology. The overall goal of this Phase II renewal project will be to complete the next stage of drug production scale-up, and highly rigorous animal studies that will lay a solid foundation for the follow-up preclinical research that will be required to support a successful IND application for initiating clinical trails. Furtherance of our successful proof-of concept studies on this project will build a solid basis for potential applications of this lectin based drug delivery technology platform to a wide variety of other previously hard to treat diseases."
"9362751","Abstract:  This proposal will examine the role of cellular positioning in the establishment of synaptic connectivity. Toward this end, experiments will be carried out in a mouse model of a human neurodevelopmental disorder, lissencephaly. Lissencephaly affects approximately 1 in 100,000 live births and mainly results from mutations in genes essential to cell proliferation and migration; the most common of which and first identified is Lis1. In lissencephaly patients, like other microcephalies, cells fail to properly migrate during embryonic development, resulting in heterotopic cell clusters. In this mouse model, heterotopic cell bands form instead of the single principal cell layer found in the normal hippocampus. Experiments in Aim 1 will determine if heterotopic bands share common features, which might suggest the existence of discrete excitatory cell types in the non-mutant hippocampus, or alternatively may indicate that heterotopic band segregation appears to be random. Several methods will be employed in this first aim, including retrograde bead injections, immunohistochemistry, and in vitro whole-cell recordings with cellular morphological reconstructions. In either outcome, experiments in the Aim 2 will use this model as a tool to investigate the effect of cellular positioning in the determination of synaptic partners by assaying interneuron connectivity within and between heterotopic bands. Recordings will be made from identified interneurons while glutamate is uncaged on cells occupying various heterotopic bands to examine the spatial distribution of synaptic innervation. These experiments will yield detailed information about synaptic topology that can then be post-hoc aligned with heterotopic band locations and excitatory cell identity. These findings will add to our understanding of the human population carrying the Lis1 mutation, and also more broadly to cellular heterotopias in other neurodevelopmental disorders.  Recent high-profile journal publications indicate that excitatory cell sub-types might exist in the radial axis of the hippocampal principal cell layer, a possibility that was previously impractical to study for technical purposes. A greater understanding of canonical forms of connectivity between specific subsets of excitatory and inhibitory cell populations seems poised to usher in a new wave of scientific progress in the field of neuroscience. This may reveal the existence of dedicated circuitry for specific brain functions, offering new therapeutic targets and simultaneously reducing off-target effects. Microcephalies have garnered renewed attention from the public owing to the spread of the Zika virus, which can cause microcephaly in babies exposed to the virus embryonically. In order to improve the quality of life and long-term prognosis for these patients the scientific community needs a deeper understanding of how disorders of development and cell migration influence synaptic connectivity."
"9436124","ABSTRACT The focus of my research program is to improve our understanding of the molecular basis by which Amyloid ? (A?) 42 causes neurodegeneration and progression of Alzheimer?s Disease (AD) and to develop novel molecular therapeutics to slow or block neuropathology. We made the discovery that addition of mirror image ?D?-A?42 to a solution that contains the natural peptide (i.e., made of naturally occurring, L-amino acids) induces accelerated fibril formation and suppresses toxicity of the peptide. This is a fundamentally novel approach to inhibit A? toxicity and as such could pave the road to the development of new molecular therapeutics that operate through a unique mechanism of action. In Aim 1 we will conduct biophysical experiments to gain deeper insight into the molecular mechanisms that underlie this effect, which I refer to as Chiral Inactivation. We will study the mechanism of fibril formation from enantiopure peptides and their mixtures by conducting both kinetic studies and fibril composition analyses through various microscopy-based techniques. We will further investigate oligomer formation from both the enantiopure peptides and their mixtures, employing a combination of photochemical crosslinking techniques and low temperature trapping experiments followed by imaging of the aggregation intermediates. In Aim 2 we will deepen our understanding of biological function of the mixtures characterized under Aim 1. We will conduct mechanistic experiments in cell culture, probing the differentially pre-aggregated mixtures with regard to their toxicity in two cell lines. Collaborating with the Madison lab at Stanford, we will then study select mixtures with electrophysiology techniques, aimed to discern the mechanism of action at the functional level of highest relevance to AD, namely functional hippocampal neuronal networks. Studies performed through this R21 funding will provide the basis for a future R01 application, within the scope of which we will aim to develop frameworks that are inspired by the chiral inactivation approach, but are more drug-like, with the ultimate goal of creating a novel molecular therapeutic against AD."
"9435618","PROJECT SUMMARY Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) produces articular erosions by activating osteoclasts to resorb bone while suppressing the ability of osteoblasts (OBs) to build bone. These erosions are a major source of pain and disability in RA and are a primary endpoint in clinical trials. Importantly, patients with RA develop systemic osteopenia/osteoporosis that is not well controlled by current therapeutic agents. Therefore, it is critical to develop new agents that are anabolic for bone in the setting of inflammatory arthritis. We discovered that the adaptor protein Schnurri-3 (SHN3) profoundly suppresses new bone formation. Mice lacking SHN3 develop a progressive increase in bone mass due to augmented activity of OBs through enhanced Wnt signaling. Importantly for patients with RA, SHN3 expression in OBs is highly upregulated by TNF plus IL-17A, and SHN3 deficiency protects from suppression of OB differentiation by these cytokines. Therefore, inhibition of SHN3 is an attractive mechanism to promote bone formation to prevent or treat the systemic and/or local bone loss that accompanies RA. Finally, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are a promising mechanism for repair of inflammation-induced bone loss and these cells may be genetically manipulated by deleting SHN3 to augment their potential to repair systemic bone loss in this setting. In this R21 application, we will test the hypothesis that SHN3 is a novel target to promote bone formation at sites of inflammation-induced bone loss in inflammatory arthritis and will determine mechanism. Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that SHN3 deficiency prevents TNF-induced systemic bone loss and augments bone healing. We will determine in Part A whether SHN3 deficiency prevents systemic bone loss using mice lacking SHN3 in MSCs in a limb-specific manner, crossed with TNF-transgenic mice. In Part B we will determine the molecular mechanisms by which SHN3 deficiency protects MSCs/OBs from the suppression of OB differentiation induced by pro-inflammatory cytokines. Additionally, using unbiased proteomics and phosphoproteomics, we will identify novel SHN3-interacting proteins and proteins regulated by SHN3 in MSCs/OBs upon TNFa and IL-17A stimulation. In Part C, we will determine whether SHN3 itself regulates the production of factors by fibroblast- like synoviocytes that inhibit OB differentiation/function, including IL-6 and DKK1.! Aim 2 will test whether SHN3-deficient MSCs can promote healing of inflammation-induced bone loss. We will test the ability of transplanted SHN3-deficient MSCs to restore systemic bone loss in TNF-transgenic mice. A synthetic peptidomimetic ligand-conjugated with alendronate (LLP2A-Ale) will be utilized to direct MSCs to the bone. Transplanted GFP-expressing MSC-derived OBs will also be subjected to transcriptome analysis and targets identified by multiple approaches will be prioritized for validation. These data will determine the mechanisms by which SHN3 mediates signaling between pro-inflammatory cytokines and the Wnt pathway in MSCs/OBs and identify new targets to promote anabolic bone formation in inflammatory arthritis."
"9348413","Project Background Veterans with PTSD often face a spiral of losses in social functioning and social resources, leading to poor community reintegration. We define community reintegration as activities and participation across a range of life roles, including relationship with spouse/significant other, parenting, education, work, social, leisure, spiritual, civic, self-care, domestic life and economic life. While those who complete evidence-based treatments like Prolonged Exposure (PE) show improvements in social functioning, only 6-11% of Veterans with PTSD start these treatments, and of those, 30-49% drop out. Peer specialists (Veterans who manage mental health challenges and are trained and supervised to support other Veterans in mental health recovery) may provide a way to help more Veterans engage in and complete PE. This research constitutes first steps to learn if supplementing PE with professional peer support may increase the numbers of Veterans who engage in and complete PE; if so, the use of peer support interventions adjunctive to PE may improve rehabilitation outcomes. Project Objectives A multidisciplinary team with expertise in peer support, treatment development, PTSD, qualitative methods, and psychosocial rehabilitation will use Veteran-centered focus group data with existing theory and research to refine an adjunctive intervention called Peer Enhanced Exposure Therapy (PEET). PEET will be designed to improve treatment engagement, treatment adherence, social functioning, and community reintegration among Veterans receiving PE. Aim 1) Refine a preliminary adjunctive intervention manual, training materials, fidelity monitors, and outcome measures for Peer Enhanced Exposure Therapy (PEET) through focus group interviews and expert panel feedback. Aim 2) Pilot test the feasibility and acceptability of the adjunctive intervention. Project Methods For Aim 1, the team will assemble focus groups for a) Veterans who are currently in or have recently dropped out of PE, and b) VA PE providers. Results from qualitative analysis of focus group content will subsequently be evaluated by experts in PE and peer support, to refine components of the treatment manual. The team will then refine the manual, training materials, fidelity monitors, and outcome measures for PEET. For Aim 2 the team will test the intervention by training 2 peer specialists and implementing the intervention for at least 12 Veterans seeking PE treatment. The intervention will be assessed using a) semi structured interviews from Veterans, PE providers, and peer specialists, b) a trial battery of potential outcome measures, and c) peer specialist performance on knowledge tests, skill performance, and fidelity monitors. Results will be used to a) refine the treatment manual and associated materials and b) support Stage II trials."
"9403325","PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Recent advances in design and actuation have led to important improvements in prosthetic limbs. However, these devices lack a means for providing direct sensory feedback, requiring users to infer information about limb state from pressure on the residual limb. Lack of sensation limits their ability to control the prosthesis and leads to slow gait and increased risk of falling. There is also evidence that lack of sensory feedback contributes to phantom limb pain (PLP), and that electrical stimulation at the dorsal root ganglia (DRG) can reduce PLP. The primary objective of this study is to use commercially available, FDA-cleared spinal cord stimulator (SCS) leads to test the effects of electrical stimulation of the DRG and dorsal rootlets (DR) as a means of restoring naturalistic sensation (e.g. pressure, movement), reducing PLP, and improving gait function in transtibial amputees. We will use stimulation to (1) produce sensations of pressure and joint movement, (2) reduce PLP, (3) evoke patterns of muscle activity that mimic automatic responses that occur normally during standing and walking, and (4) improve postural stability when standing and walking with a sensorized prosthesis. Aim 1: Use stimulation of the DRG/DR to generate naturalistic sensations of pressure and joint movement, localized to the amputated limb, and achieve a clinically relevant reduction in phantom limb pain To provide intuitive feedback, evoked sensations should be perceived as originating in the amputated limb and should feel naturalistic. A concomitant reduction in PLP may also have important effects on quality of life. We will perform detailed psychophysical testing in which stimulation parameters are varied while study participants are asked to report information about the evoked sensation (e.g. location, modality, naturalness) and the effects on PLP. Aim 2: Characterize the motor responses in the intact and amputated limbs evoked by DRG/DR stimulation and their relationship to stimulation parameters Bilaterally coordinated reflexes play an important role when responding to unexpected perturbations like slips and trips. Additionally, the transitions between phases of gait are largely mediated by reflexive responses to sensory input from the legs. For a prosthesis to restore the full capabilities of the amputated limb during standing and walking, the ability to evoke and precisely control these patterns of reflexive activity will be critical. We will record electromyogram (EMG) signals from the limbs during standing and walking while varying stimulus patterns and quantify the relationships between stimulation parameters and evoked reflexive responses. Understanding these relationships will aide in the programming of stimulation patterns for functional prosthesis use. Aim 3: Decrease postural sway and increase gait stability by providing sensory feedback via DRG/DR stimulation To quantify the functional impact of sensory restoration on prosthetic limb usage, we will instrument each participant's prosthetic limb with a pressure sensitive insole and joint angle sensors, and use signals from these devices to modulate stimulation. We will perform a battery of posture and balance measures, and we will track changes in functional prosthesis usage after a 7-day take-home trial of the device."
"9471154","Stroke, together with heart disease, accounts for the largest proportion of non-communicable diseases and deaths worldwide. In the US, there are 795,000 annual stroke cases and 150,000 deaths from stroke. Numbers will steeply increase with the aging population. Stroke remains the main cause of serious long-term disability with minorities being affected disproportionally. Greater risk of stroke exists among blacks and Hispanics at younger ages; blacks have greater stroke mortality. Though measures of quality of stroke care during acute hospitalization have improved, little evidence exists on the quality of processes leading to effective stroke prevention and rehabilitation after hospital discharge. Unexpected hospital readmissions 30 days after acute stroke hospitalization are common, as high as 25%, and lead to excess morbidity and cost. Stroke impact on patients', families', and communities' quality of life, and the burden on use and cost of health care is enormous. We propose the Transitions of Care Stroke Disparity Study (TCSD-S) with the main objective to identify race- ethnic and sex disparities in hospital-to-home transition of stroke care and outcomes, social determinants of health associated with these disparities, and to develop effective hospital-initiated system level initiatives to reduce disparities and readmissions, and to improve stroke outcomes. To achieve this objective, we will capitalize on the rich infrastructure and resources of our unique Florida Stroke Registry (FSR), which includes a well-developed network of hospitals, health providers, partnership with the AHA, and other Florida stakeholders. We will evaluate medication adherence, healthy lifestyle, utilization of rehabilitation interventions and medical follow-up 30 days after hospital discharge to home across representative Florida Comprehensive Stroke Centers. A novel Transitions of Stroke Care Performance Index (TOSC PI) will be derived and validated. Thi index will be a primary outcome together with hospital readmissions and stroke outcomes (disability, recurrence, cardiovascular events, and death). Data on TOSC and stroke outcomes will be collected by structured telephone interviews at 30 and 90 days after discharge and review of patient charts. Predictors of TOSC disparities and outcomes will be evaluated using baseline in-hospital data of the index stroke obtained from the FSR, and Social Determinants of Health obtained through a novel data collection instrument from publicly available records. Based on identified predictors of TOSC disparities, we will develop and assess the feasibility of initiatives to reduce TOSC disparities, targeting systems of care with a TOSC disparities dashboard, and health care providers with a training module for enhanced patient education and support at discharge and during follow-up. We will compare the TOSC PI and outcomes before and after the initiatives. The successful completion of this study will identify disparities in hospital-to-home TOSC, define key predictors of poor TOSC and stroke outcomes, and develop initiatives which will be scalable across health systems and which will address disparities, readmission rates, and poor outcomes."
"9474463","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cigarette smoking remains the number one cause of preventable morbidity and mortality in the U.S. Each year, one third to one half of smokers attempt to quit at least once; however, approximately 94% of quit attempts fail. A number of interventions have been developed to help smokers initiate and maintain abstinence. Unfortunately, even though most smokers express a desire to quit, relapse is the most likely outcome. Thus, it is not only critically important that more effective interventions be developed to reduce relapse, but it is also a primary public health goal to ensure that evidence-based smoking cessation interventions be made widely available, and at a low cost, to smokers. One of the most powerful, evidence-based behavioral interventions for smoking cessation is contingency management (CM). CM for smoking cessation consists of delivering incentives (typically money) contingent on objective evidence of smoking abstinence (e.g., carbon monoxide [CO] levels in the exhaled breath). However, the cost of providing incentives, the time it takes to administer the program, and the distance that must be traveled to participate in supervised monitoring procedures are often cited as barriers to CM. This SBIR Fast-Track proposal seeks to develop a mobile videogame-based contingency management intervention for smoking cessation. The goals of the present proposal are to markedly decrease costs, improve sustainability, and further increase accessibility of CM interventions for smoking cessation. To increase access, all aspects of the intervention will be available via Android or iOS smartphones used in conjunction with a matchbox-sized peripheral device for monitoring breath CO. To decrease costs and improve sustainability, the mobile game we will develop will allow us to replace the monetary incentives typically used in CM interventions with in-game virtual rewards that can immediately be used to help players meet game objectives, as well as with social reinforcement, prompted and incentivized in the context of the game. In Phase I, an iterative design and formative evaluation process will be used to create a game design and storyboard for the mobile game to be developed in Phase II, the CO data collection software will be produced and integrated with the CO Monitor, and a demo of the videogame will be developed. The demo created will be presented to 20 treatment-seeking smokers owning the target platform devices, who will then complete a survey & prospective evaluation of the planned intervention. In Phase II the development of the videogame, capable of supporting 7 weeks of play, will be completed, and a 7 week randomized control trial outcome evaluation will be conducted with 114 subjects to assess the feasibility, acceptability, appeal, and efficacy of the smoking cessation intervention."

"9432090","Myelin is a crucial component of our nervous system. In the CNS, specialized cells known as oligodendrocytes (OLs) differentiate from precursor cells (OPCs) and produce myelin by wrapping their plasma membranes around axons. Myelin's main function is to insulate axons and allow for the fast conduction of electrical impulses, and myelin damage as seen in preterm white matter injury and multiple sclerosis can lead to permanent neurological disability. Currently no therapy exists for repairing this damage, but promoting OL differentiation and myelination is a promising strategy. It is therefore important to understand how these processes are regulated. My long term research goal is to understand the microenvironmental factors that regulate OL differentiation and myelination. My short term goals are to (1) uncouple OL differentiation and myelination and determine whether dynamic neuronal signaling has a role in regulating either process, and (2) support a role for astrocytes in regulating OL differentiation. I will pursue my first aim in the lab of Dr. Jonah Chan, an expert in neuronal-glial interactions, during phase I of the K22 award. To examine the role of dynamic neuronal signaling I propose to completely eliminate it along the optic nerve by enucleating one eye of Wlds mice. I will do this at two time points, an early time point to analyze OL differentiation and a later time point to analyze myelination. I will also determine whether axon diameter is the main determinant of myelination by performing enucleations in transgenic mice whose optic nerve axons are larger than normal (Pten cKOs). My preliminary findings indicate that (1) OL differentiation and myelination are regulated by distinct mechanisms and (2) dynamic neuronal signaling is not required for OL differentiation. For phase II, I will independently investigate whether astrocyte factors whose transcription is upregulated during developmental OL differentiation are sufficient and necessary to promote or inhibit OL differentiation. I propose to test sufficiency in vitro using the BIMA screening assay where OPCs are isolated and seeded onto micropillar arrays then treated with astrocyte factors to determine whether these proteins have an effect on OL differentiation. Then CRISPR/Cas9 technologies will be used to specifically knock out the astroglial factors in vivo and determine whether they are necessary for proper OL differentiation. I believe that these findings will uncover novel regulators of OL differentiation, which could lead to myelin-promoting therapies. In order to successfully achieve my research goals I will learn BIMA screening, electrophysiology, and astrocyte culture techniques under the guidance of my sponsor, Dr. Chan and advisors during phase I. I will also become better trained in crucial career development skills such as communication, leadership, management, and job interviewing skills by participating in UCSF seminars and workshops during phase I. I am confident that this phase I training along with the mentorship of my sponsor and advisors as well as the superior research environment at UCSF will allow me to achieve my career goal of becoming an independent investigator at a top university."
"9552370","Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is a neurodevelopmental disorder with a known genetic etiology, but a complex epigenetic basis. PWS is an imprinted disorder, meaning that loss of genes expressed only on the paternal but not the maternal chromosome 15q11- q13 region cause disease. Furthermore, unlike genetic mutations that affect protein- coding genes, the smallest genetic deletions causing PWS only affect noncoding transcripts of RNA. At the heart of the minimally deleted region in PWS are two types of noncoding RNAs. First, the SNORD116 small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) localize to the nucleolus in maturing neurons and impact rRNA and nucleolar maturation. Second, the host gene exons (116HG) surrounding the SNORD116 snoRNAs are spliced and nuclear retained as a long noncoding RNA (lncRNA), forming a large RNA cloud-like structure that regulates diurnally expressed transcription and metabolism. The intronic sequences with high GC skew form DNA:RNA hybrid structures called R-loops that promote chromatin decondensation and slow transcriptional progression of the antisense transcript to the Angelman syndrome (AS) gene UBE3A. In this proposal, we seek to answer three major unanswered questions regarding the molecular pathogenesis of PWS. 1) What are the major genetic and cellular components required for noncoding RNA localization and function leading to the PWS phenotypes? 2) What is the influence of diurnal time on the cross-regulatory mechanisms of the PWS locus? 3) Could alterations to light/dark cycles and temperature be used to optimize a rapamycin therapy in the PWS mouse model? The results of these experiments are expected to improve understanding of the functional role of the lncRNAs at the heart of the PWS locus."
"9424540","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Pediatric arterial ischemic stroke afflicts ?2,000 U.S. children every year, permanently disabling most, yet is poorly understood. The Vascular effects of Infection in Pediatric Stroke (VIPS I) study established an international network of 37 sites that enrolled 355 children with stroke and 354 controls. We discovered: (a) minor clinical infections act as a stroke trigger, while routine childhood vaccinations are protective; (b) almost half of children with stroke have an acute herpesvirus infection (the cause of chicken pox, cold sores, and other common illnesses); and (c) children with stroke have a high risk of recurrent stroke, particularly if they have an arteriopathy. A VIPS pilot study suggests that other common childhood pathogens may also play a role, possibly in combination with herpesviruses. The full spectrum of pathogens that contribute to childhood stroke risk remains unknown. Infection is compelling as a treatable stroke risk factor, with available therapies for both pathogens and downstream inflammatory effects. However, VIPS I findings present a paradox: infection is common, while childhood stroke is uncommon. Possible explanations are (1) the ?infection hypothesis?: unusual pathogen strains, or combinations of pathogens, lead to stroke; and (2) the ?host response hypothesis?: an unusual inflammatory response to infection leads to stroke.  A thorough understanding of both the specific pathogens and inflammatory mediators underlying childhood stroke pathogenesis, particularly arteriopathic stroke, is needed to develop strategies to reduce recurrent stroke in children. Broad testing for infections through traditional methods is prohibitively costly, and requires preconceived assumptions about the pathogens involved. Next generation sequencing (NGS) allows for the efficient, highly sensitive and unbiased detection of any pathogen, known or novel, by sequencing all nucleic acids in a biological sample and matching them with genomes in a reference database. To study the inflammatory response, multiplex bead arrays can now efficiently test for a large number of immune mediators on tiny blood samples. VIPS II will use these cutting-edge techniques to address the VIPS I paradox and better understand the causes of childhood stroke. The specific aims are to (1) identify known and novel pathogens in children with stroke, and determine whether different pathogens are seen with arteriopathic versus other stroke types; (2) determine whether children with arteriopathic stroke have a different inflammatory response compared to those with other stroke types; and (3) use data from Aims 1 and 2 to explore different mechanistic pathways from infection, to inflammation, to arteriopathic stroke, and other stroke types.  The goal of VIPS II is to gain the knowledge needed to protect children with stroke from additional brain injury. Its results will guide the selection of currently available therapies?such as antimicrobials and anti- inflammatory medications?for a pediatric clinical trial aimed at preventing recurrent stroke."
"9352290","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This goal of this project, Eliminating CLABSI in Ambulatory Patients, is to determine whether use of 70% isopropyl alcohol embedded protective caps on central lines, layered on top of reliable use of best practice Maintenance Care for central lines, is associated with reduction in ambulatory central line- associated bloodstream infections in a high-risk population of pediatric hematology/oncology patients. The Children's Hospital Association, a 200+ member, not-for-profit organization of children's hospitals, has developed, sustained and spread quality transformation efforts focused on CLABSI elimination in hospital settings. The Association's CLABSI work is supported by an Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) grant (R18 HS019590 Eliminating CLABSIs in Chronic Central Lines) to reduce CLABSI in hospitalized, non-intensive care unit (ICU) children. Preliminary analyses show a roughly 30% decrease in CLABSI rates in this high risk, hospitalized, but non-ICU population. The Association's Pediatric ICU CLABSI effort, involving over 70 PICUs, has resulted in CLABSI rates dropping dramatically from 5.5 infections per 1,000 central line days to approximately 1 infection per 1,000 central line days. Despite these successes, it remains unknown what generalizable best practices should be with chronic central lines in the home setting and how effective involving patients and caregivers across multiple institutions in CLABSI reduction efforts will be. Our proposal will build on ongoing AHRQ-funded work with 24 children's hospitals. We will use a cluster-randomized, cross over design, clinical trial to evaluate a promising new intervention to reduce CLABSI among children with chronic central lines in the home setting."
"9393032","Project Summary/Abstract Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is the most common form of focal epilepsy characterized by unprovoked, spontaneous seizures originating in the temporal lobe of the brain. 30% of patients do not gain seizure control through medication, leading to the remaining treatment option of surgical resection of the epileptic tissue. Improved therapies are sorely needed, including during epileptogenesis, the process of developing spontaneous seizures characteristic of chronic epilepsy. In resected tissue from TLE patients, deficits in neuronal inhibition have been observed at multiple levels, including cellular death in interneuron populations, alterations in levels of ?-aminobutyric acid receptors (GABAARs), and lesser studied reductions in chloride co- transporter function. In the majority of mature neurons within the brain, the electroneutral K+/Cl- co-transporter 2 (KCC2) promotes hyperpolarizing GABAAR responses through coupling the outward K+ gradient to Cl? efflux. When KCC2 transport is reduced, chloride loading of neurons results in depolarizing or even excitatory GABAAR responses. Reductions in KCC2 levels and depolarizing GABAAR responses have been observed in both resected tissue from human TLE patients and from animal models of TLE. However, the role of KCC2 deficits in epileptogenesis remains poorly understood. We will test the hypothesis that ?Decreased KCC2 function results in the development of pharmacoresistant seizures and anatomical changes characteristic of temporal lobe epilepsy.? I will use a novel flox-KCC2 mouse developed by our group to delete KCC2 transport function in specific neuronal populations within the brain in vivo. Experiments using both in vivo and in vitro electrophysiology will demonstrate how deficits in KCC2 transport affect network/neuronal excitability and the development of seizure refractoriness to anti-epileptic drugs. Preliminary experiments demonstrate that deletion of KCC2 in the hippocampus of adult mice results in spontaneous seizures. Further experiments will explore how this reduction in KCC2 transport affects markers of epileptogenesis. Collectively these experiments will provide new mechanistic insights into how deficits in KCC2 transport directly contribute to the pathophysiology of TLE and may aid the development of more efficacious treatments to limit the development of TLE and other epilepsies."
"9539262","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of this project is to develop a new paradigm for targeting the HIV-1 envelope in order to inactivate the virus specifically, and before host cell encounter. The uniquely HIV-1-specific envelope spike protein, comprised of the trimeric complex of gp120 and gp41 heterodimers embedded in the virus membrane, is the only virus-specific protein exposed on the outside of the virion particle and thus is an attractive targt for neutralizing the virus. HIV-1 inactivation by targeting the Env protein could prevent initial infection, and suppress virus spread in already-infected individuals. Recently, we reported the discovery of a molecule termed CVN-DAVEI that selectively induced destructive lysis of both fully infectious BaL HIV-1 and pseudotyped virus. Our vision is that CVN-DAVEI takes advantage of the inherent metastability of the Env complex to destroy the virus, and that this metastability is an Achilles' heel against which a new class of HIV- inactivating hunter-killer molecules can be designed. While the HIV-1 inactivation phenotype is enticing, our understanding of the structural mechanism of DAVEI function is incomplete. In this proposal, we will determine this mechanism and use the resulting mechanistic underpinning to move towards smaller and more clinically relevant HIV-1 inactivator lead compounds. Our project team will embody the required protein science, molecular design, chemical synthesis and computational structure analysis expertise to accomplish these overarching goals. Three interconnected Specific Aims are proposed. Aim 1. Determine the mechanism of the DAVEI MPER domain in the lytic inactivation of HIV-1. Aim 2. Determine the mechanism of Env glycan engagement by the DAVEI lectin domain and the stoichiometry of DAVEI:Env spike encounter. Aim 3. Define the roles of Env structure and conformational plasticity in the lytic inactivation of HIV-1 by DAVEI via the design of novel DAVEI fusion constructs. Overall, this work will define the minimum requirements for virolytic function by dual-binding molecules. In turn, the results will expand our understanding on how the virus metastability, that is a requirement for HIV-1 cell infection, can be exploited for DAVEI-induced HIV-1 lysis. The project will yield hunter-killer lead compounds that will open up new molecular design strategies for preventing transmission and battling infection. Finally, the virolysis activity engineered into these anti-HIV constructs wll provide precedent to design molecules to combat other metastable enveloped viruses, such as influenza, Ebola, and dengue."
"9318133","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This renewal application proposes to continue the cancer prevention programs of the University of Kentucky PRC, the only PRC dedicated to cancer prevention in rural Appalachia. Known locally as the Rural Cancer Prevention Center (RCPC), our past focus has been on the prevention (through vaccination) and early detection of cervical cancer. Through social marketing and planned outreach the RCPC has successfully leveraged the trust of rural people residing in the most economically depressed area of Appalachia (southeastern, KY). The proposed renewal offers plans to continue our community-based cancer prevention research, and to extend our programs to other regions of Appalachia, using sustainable models. Moreover, the previous research pertaining to cervical cancer prevention created a strong basis for testing a novel approach to community-based screening for colorectal cancer (CRC). Based on new screening technology, this approach will be effective and accessible to medically disenfranchised and under-served rural residents. The proposed plan has 5 general aims (A-E) and a specific research aim (F): A) Provide infrastructure and administrative services that support cancer prevention; B) Build community capacity and actively engage the community in partnerships for cancer prevention; C) Provide an efficient and effective communications network that ties cancer prevention activities together and disseminates health communication; D) Offer training and technical support to state and local agencies; E) Evaluate (process and outcome) all planned activities related to aims A-D; and F) Conduct an applied prevention research project that demonstrates the value of using community change agents to foster widespread adoption of annual colorectal cancer (CRC) screening with Fecal Immunochemical Test (FIT), followed by navigation to colonoscopy for those screening FIT-positive, and by an intervention program that promote annual repeat use of FIT. All six aims are inter-related; however, the final aim is a highly focused set of activities that occur in two phases: 1) the programs supporting this aim will be tested in Years 1-3, and 2) to benefit other rural Appalachian states, dissemination and implementation activities will be conducted in Years 4-5. Programs to be tested in Years 1-3 include 1) a community-based intervention featuring a Diffusion of Innovations model, standard RCPC outreach methods, and academic detailing for health care providers tested using a non-equivalent comparison design; this trial will end when 500 FIT specimens have been returned in the intervention health district, 2) a social network analysis (N = 64) used to provide interim feedback regarding key characteristics of effective change agents used in the diffusion model, 3) a navigation program (based on current RCPC practices for cervical cancer) that will be applied to people testing FIT-positive (N = 60), and 4)  an internet-based program designed to foster annual repeat FIT screening tested using a randomized, controlled trial design (N = 220). Programs will be designed for optimal sustainability and dissemination/implementation potential."
"9445520","PROJECT DESCRIPTION: Extant research indicates that lesbian, gay and bisexual (LGB) individuals are at heightened risk for substance use disorders (SUD), and that sexual minority discrimination and accumulated life stresses may be etiologic to SUD; however, few studies have attempted to study these factors among sexual minorities. This proposal, Discrimination, Stress and Substance Use Disorder among Sexual Minority Adults: A Secondary Analysis of NESARC-III addresses the dearth in research regarding sexual minorities, and responds to PAR-16-234, Accelerating the Pace of Drug Abuse Research Using Existing Data. In 2015, the NESARC-III data became available for secondary analysis and includes the largest, nationally representative sample of LGB individuals and the most comprehensive measures of SUD, and heterosexual and LGB sexual orientation. The NESARC-III includes: a) a large sample of heterosexual and LGB individuals for general and subsample comparisons; b) a measure of sexual orientation that allows for an assessment of SUD and discordant orientation within three dimensions of sexual orientation (attraction, behavior, identity); c) valid and reliable measures of sexual minority discrimination (distal/institutional and proximal/individual), childhood stress, accumulated stress, quality of life and health, treatment seeking and recovery; and d) substance use measures that align with the new DSM-5 criteria for SUD and other psychiatric disorders. The NESARC-III is the only large-scale nationally representative survey that allows for a psycho-social and epidemiological examination of LGB and heterosexual individuals, and SUD based on DSM-5 diagnostic criteria. Guided by Meyer's Minority Stress Model and using NESARC-III data, we test our proposed model, the Sexual Minority Stress Model (SMStM): Aim 1: Assess prevalence of: a) substance use disorders (DSM-5 diagnosis) including severity level (mild, moderate and severe); b) specific drug use disorders (e.g., DSM-5 cannabis disorder); c) psychiatric comorbidities associated with substance use disorders (DSM-5 diagnosis); and d) recovery/remission from substance use disorders based on attraction, behavior, and identity. Examine variations by sex, age, birth cohort, race/ethnicity. Aim 2: Evaluate the extent to which our proposed SMStM is evidenced in the NESARC-III data: a) We will determine if the overall measurement model provides a better model fit for sexual minorities when compared to heterosexuals; b) We will determine if model fit improves for sexual minorities when measures for individual and institutional sexual minority discrimination are included; c) We will assess differences in model fit across birth cohorts. Aim 3 We will evaluate the extent to which sexual orientation discordance contributes to our understanding of SUD in the context of the SMStM for all respondents, and by sexual minority status. It is hypothesized that sexual discordance (i.e. mis-alignment of respondents' sexual identity with their sexual attraction, behavior, or both) will be associated with SUD outcomes for all heterosexual and LGB respondents. We will assess differences across birth cohorts."
"9552313","Abstract Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) is a CD4 T cell-dependent model for the human disease multiple sclerosis (MS). In these diseases, a complex immune response is orchestrated toward central nervous system (CNS) myelin. Ultimately, the cascade of inflammatory events culminates in myelin and neuronal damage, mediated in large part by phagocytic immune cells such as infiltrating macrophages and activated microglia. The molecular regulation that governs inflammatory responses by these innate cell subsets remains unclear. In preliminary studies, we have discovered that the Transient Receptor Potential (TRP) cation channel, TRPV4 is expressed by microglial cells and functions to propagate effector inflammatory responses during EAE. These data have led us to hypothesize that expression of TRPV4 by innate immune cells, including circulating monocytes and microglia, contributes to the pathogenesis of MS and can be modulated to reduce the severity of neuro-inflammation. We will employ three complementary aims to explore this hypothesis. First, we will determine the cellular basis of TRPV4-mediated neuro-immune interactions in the CNS using both radiation bone marrow chimeras and a new murine reagent we have designed in which TRPV4 is conditionally expressed in vivo. Second, we will determine the therapeutic effect of TRPV4 inhibition during EAE. Third, we will examine human tissue and material from an extensive bio-repository to assess the expression of TRPV4 in immune cells and MS lesions. This highly translational study will establish the cellular mechanism of TRPV4- dependent immune activation during EAE, the potential for pharmacologic modulation of neuro-inflammation via TRPV4, and the association of TRPV4 in patients with MS. Thus, this study engenders a unique opportunity to identify a molecular target for the rational design of treatment for neuro-inflammatory diseases such as MS."
"9561275","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The optic nerve of adult humans shows little potential for regeneration or self-repair, which presents a major challenge to restoring vision in patients with optic nerve injury or diseases, including glaucoma. These patients thus suffer from the pathological consequences and vision loss for the rest of their lives. A regenerative therapy is vital for preserving sight or reversing vision loss. Yet an in depth understanding of the molecular basis that controls optic nerve growth/regeneration remains ambiguous. We here propose to investigate why the optic nerve fails to regenerate and how nerve regeneration can be enhanced to improve neuronal function after injury. Long-standing work from my and other laboratories has shown that optic nerve growth is a programed event during development whose shut-down contributes critically to the failure of optic nerve regeneration. A recent discovery in my laboratory has identified a novel potent regulator, insulin-like growth factor (IGF binding protein like 1 (IGFBPL1) whose presence activates the growth program and regenerative process of retinal ganglion cell (RGC) axons and induces activation of IGF-1 receptor (IGF-1R) and its downstream signals. Administration of exogenous IGFBPL1 promoted optic nerve regeneration and RGC survival in adult mice; whereas, blockade of IGF-1R-induced signals, at least in culture, abolished IGFBPL1-mediated axonal growth or regeneration. This points to a central role for IGFBPL1 functioning through IGF-1R-induced intracellular events to regulate optic nerve regeneration. Importantly, IGFBPL1 as a secretory factor presents a clinically feasible candidate for manipulating nerve regeneration and restoring vision after injury in humans. This proposal thus seeks to further explore the underlying mechanisms through which IGFBPL1, particularly its relation to IGF-1R-mediated signals, promotes RGC axon regeneration. Moreover, it will evaluate the efficacy of IGFBPL1 on promoting optic nerve regeneration in an established animal model of optic nerve injury. Completion of the proposed studies will uncover a previously unknown signaling loop in IGF-1R-mediated cascades in the regulation of RGC axon growth and will advance our understanding of the mechanisms that control optic nerve regeneration and repair. This will accelerate the preclinical development of a novel regenerative therapy for currently untreatable conditions. As the optic nerve has long served as a standard model for the study of CNS injury, results may also have a broad impact on the development of new therapies to treat brain and spinal cord injury or diseases."
"9449187","Placing orders on the wrong patient in Electronic Health Records (EHRs) is one of the most significant Health Information Technology (IT) Safety challenges healthcare organizations face today. To prevent these errors, the Office of the National Coordinator for Health IT (ONC) ?SAFER Guide? recommends displaying patient photographs in EHRs, but the vast majority of healthcare systems have not adopted this practice. In a national survey, respondents cited lack of evidence that photographs improve safety and implementation challenges as major barriers to adoption. The goals of this project are to provide rigorous evidence that patient photographs prevent wrong-patient errors, and to develop an AHRQ Health IT Toolkit to guide healthcare organizations through the implementation process. Successful completion of this project will provide evidence and resources to accelerate adoption of patient photographs in EHRs to prevent wrong-patient errors.  Because implementation of patient photographs may vary across organizations and EHR systems, a collaborative approach has a high likelihood of success and potential for broad applicability. The proposed research will be conducted by experienced investigators at Columbia University Medical Center and Johns Hopkins Medicine, in collaboration with the ECRI Institute's Partnership for Health IT Patient Safety. This multi- stakeholder collaborative, representing large healthcare systems, researchers, patient safety organizations, EHR vendors, and patient safety experts, will produce results that are rigorous and generalizable.  We will pursue the following specific aims: Aim 1) Provide rigorous evidence for the efficacy of displaying patient photographs in EHRs by conducting a multisite, cluster randomized controlled trial comparing the frequency of wrong-patient orders among providers randomized to view order screens with versus without patient photographs; Aim 1A) Conduct subanalyses to identify factors that impact the effectiveness of patient photographs on the frequency of wrong-patient orders, including characteristics of providers, patients, and order sessions; Aim 2) Demonstrate generalizability by conducting multiple before- after implementation studies using different EHR systems to evaluate the effectiveness of patient photographs for reducing the frequency of wrong-patient orders across sites and EHR systems; Aim 3) Provide implementation guidance for displaying patient photographs in EHRs by developing the first AHRQ Health IT Toolkit, ?Implementing Patient Photographs in EHR Systems?; and Aim 3A) Conduct a qualitative evaluation to examine user perceptions and experience of patient photographs in the different EHR systems, including staff, providers, and patients.  This proposal responds to AHRQ Special Emphasis Notice (NOT-HS-16-009), requesting applications to ?conduct research on safe health IT practices specifically related to the design, implementation, usability, and safe use of health IT? that would ?inform health IT certification and other forms of policy guidance.?"
"9231554","ABSTRACT Determination of the mechanisms by which 2,3,78-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) suppress immunity are important for several reasons. First, there is potential for chronic low dose TCDD exposure to produce immunotoxicity and render populations susceptible to disease. Second, TCDD can be used as a model ligand to understand aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) signaling in lymphocytes. Finally, identification of AHR ligands that produce less systemic toxicity than TCDD might lead to useful therapeutics for autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. We have established that subchronic low dose TCDD produced suppression of effector T cell function and attenuation of disease in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an animal model of multiple sclerosis. We determined that TCDD not only suppressed T cell cytokine production but also induced regulatory T cells (Tregs). The goal of this research proposal is to determine the effect of TCDD on regulatory B cell populations in EAE and assess the contribution that TCDD-treated regulatory B cells make to TCDD-mediated alterations in T cell function. We will test the hypothesis that the mechanism by which TCDD suppresses EAE involves induction of regulatory cells, which control effector and regulatory T cell responses. Our first specific aim (SA) will be to characterize the effects of TCDD on regulatory B cell populations with a focus on regulatory B cells that can alter T cell function through cell-cell interactions. Our second SA is to determine the role that TCDD-treated B regulatory cells have on TH1, TH2 and TH17 effector T cells. Our third SA is to determine the role that TCDD-treated B regulatory cells have on Tregs. We expect that the results from these studies will establish that TCDD can induce regulatory B cell populations that contribute to either suppression of effector T cell responses or induction of Tregs. The studies will also provide a comparison of the ability of TCDD to induce regulatory B cells in mouse and human. Another critical aspect of this research proposal is that several undergraduate students will be involved over the 3-year period and receive training in hypothesis testing, experimental design, data analysis and interpretation, and effective dissemination of results in both oral and written form."
"9469248","PROJECT SUMMARY There is a growing appreciation of mitochondrial dysfunction contributing to several diseases such as cancer, diabetes, neurodegenerative disease, and mitochondrial diseases. Mitochondrial diseases result from mutations in mitochondrial genes that cause bioenergetic defects in high-energy tissues leading to tissue damage. Currently, there are no effective treatment options for individuals afflicted with mitochondrial diseases and few promising targets for drug development. In this research proposal, we aim to elucidate genetic mechanisms that rescue the bioenergetics deficits associated with mitochondrial mutations in human cells. I propose to 1) mechanistically dissect how inhibition of BRD4 (a bromodomain-containing protein identified in our recent unbiased screens) rescues mitochondrial bioenergetics, 2) determine cellular effectors (factors or metabolic pathways) downstream of BRD4 inhibition, and 3) identify additional genes that rescue mitochondrial respiratory chain deficiencies through CRISPR gene-editing technology. I will first determine the PGC1? transcription factor that upregulates expression of mitochondrial respiratory genes in the context of BRD4 inhibition through gene knockdown studies. This will allow me to further test our model that mitochondrial gene promoter access by at least one PGC1? transcription factor is inhibited by BRD4 promoter occupancy using ChIP analyses. For my second aim, I will perform paired mitochondrial proteomics and metabolomics to uncover the effectors downstream of BRD4 inhibition and for my third aim, I will expand our CRISPR-based platform to identify gene mutations that rescue the bioenergetics defects associated with respiratory chain complex IV deficiency. These studies with utilize resources at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, and the Broad Institute to provide insights into how cells cope with mitochondrial deficiencies and identify potential therapeutic targets for mitochondrial diseases."
"9387195","ABSTRACT Chronic kidney disease is a progressive and heterogeneous condition that affects 10% of individuals worldwide, and a cause of premature cardiovascular disease and death. Little is known about the mechanisms leading to its development and predisposition. Despite the strong evidence for a role of ancestry in chronic kidney disease susceptibility, few studies have leveraged ancestry for gene discovery. Hispanics are an understudied minority group that is comprised of many overlapping ancestral groups (Amerindian, West African, European). Hispanics have a high prevalence of increased albuminuria and end-stage renal disease, which has been associated with their Amerindian ancestry. We propose to identify ancestry-specific loci, and their corresponding rare and common genetic variants, that explain the higher susceptibility for chronic kidney disease in Hispanics. We will use novel admixture mapping approaches to map genomic segments and variants inherited from the ancestral population with the higher disease variant frequency (Aim 1), followed by fine-mapping and validation of associations in ancestry-specific cohorts (Hispanics, American Indians, European and West Africa ancestries) (Aim 2). We will leverage data from the large population-based Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos for gene discovery, and propose to fine-map Amerindian loci using a combination of genotyping and targeted sequencing. To gain insights into the functional roles of identified genes, we will prioritize variants for experiments using in vitro and mouse model systems for transgenic and gene targeting studies (Aim 3). This proposal leverages ancestry to identify loci for kidney traits in Hispanics, and uniquely complement large ongoing genome wide association approaches. Our results will provide clues to racial/ethnic disparities in disease risk, and improve understanding of the biological pathways leading to chronic kidney disease. Ultimately this research could inform personalized medicine and improve public health."
"9444838","Project Summary / Abstract Assessing the health effects of exposure to complex mixtures is a priority for NIEHS: ?It is imperative to develop methods to assess the health effects associated with complex exposures in order to minimize their impact on the development of disease.? The vast number of potential mixtures includes environmental chemicals, pharmaceuticals, dietary and endogenous compounds. Concentration addition/dose addition (CA) is a predictive method widely used for compounds that act by similar mechanisms and provides a foundation for risk assessment. However, CA cannot make predictions for mixtures that contain full and partial receptor agonists at effect levels above that of the least efficacious component. Since partial agonists are common, we developed Generalized Concentration Addition (GCA) to address this need. GCA has been applied to systems where ligands compete for a single receptor binding site, successfully predicting experimental data for mixtures of AhR ligands and of PPAR? ligands. This project focuses on ligand-receptor systems as they are biologically important, initiate many toxicity pathways, and are amenable to modeling and rapid testing. Our overall hypothesis is that GCA applies to all receptor systems in which ligands reversibly compete for the same receptor binding sites. Based on mechanistic information, we use pharmacologically-based mathematical modeling to estimate the biological effect of mixtures; we test the predictions with empirical data. Here, we propose to test the ability of GCA to predict the biological effects of more complex receptors and mixture scenarios. Specific Aim 1 tests the ability of GCA to predict receptor activation by mixtures of ligands for receptors that homodimerize. The predictions will be tested using reporter cell lines for AR and ER? and a spectrum of ligands (full agonists, partial agonists, competitive antagonists). Applicability of GCA will be further examined using Tox21 data for single chemicals and mixtures. Specific Aim 2 tests the ability of GCA to predict mixture effects for downstream biological endpoints. We hypothesize that GCA predicts a downstream effect if the effect is a function of receptor activation. This will be tested for proximal and distal effects of mixtures of ER ligands (in vitro) and PPAR? ligands (in vitro and in vivo). Specific Aim 3 examines how similar mechanisms must be for GCA to apply. Models for several ?similar? mechanisms will be compared with empirical data: 1) mixtures that contain selective receptor modulators for ER? and PPAR?; 2) heterodimer partners that each bind ligands (ER?:ER?, PPAR?:RXR) and 3) mixtures containing an aromatase inhibitor (altering the amount of natural ligand) plus ER? ligands. This project builds upon the Tox21 recommendations of examining perturbations of toxicity pathways, increased use of in vitro testing and computational models and will generate a powerful approach for improving risk assessment of mixtures."
"9391615","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):      Our proposal focuses on novel pharmacological interventional strategies to improve the quality of life in the aging Veteran population afflicted with urinary incontinence. As the population of elderly veterans grows rapidly, it is poised to become a significant health burden on the VA Healthcare System. Urinary incontinence (UI; involuntary leakage of urine) affects a large number of men & women (>15%) and the incidence increases with age. It is a major medical illness that adversely affects one's quality of life. Urethral sphincters as well as pelvic floor muscles (PFM) play important roles in urinary continence mechanisms and age-related degenerative changes in these muscles are recognized as the most common cause for UI in the geriatric population. Injuries to the PFM (women) or to the urethral sphincters (men) are recognized as a significant cause for the sphincter complex dysfunction. We hypothesize that impaired muscle regeneration after the injury of the sphincter muscle complex as well as increased fibrosis/ muscle atrophy observed during advanced aging is mediated by a novel molecular pathway (Wnt -ß catenin signaling). A clear understanding of these molecular mechanisms involved in sphincter fibrosis/atrophy would enable the development of innovative strategies to treat this disorder in the aging population. Our preliminary animal (rabbit) studies confirm our hypothesis and suggest targeting Wnt signaling pathways could attenuate sphincter atrophy/fibrosis and improve muscle function. Our specific aims are: 1) To determine the role of Wnt/ß- catenin signaling pathways in the regeneration of new muscle fibers, formation of fibrosis/ and EAS muscle function and its architecture following surgical injury; 2) To evaluate the effect of aging on the urethral/ PFM muscle function and determine the role of W nt signaling pathways in the age related degenerative changes on the muscle function; (3). (A) To evaluate the myo-architecture of urethral sphincter muscle complex using novel MR- diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) before and during spontaneous healing process in men undergoing prostatectomy; (B) correlate time course of continence recovery with age and anatomical defects. We anticipate that the principles learned from these studies will enable the identificatio of novel therapeutic strategies to prevent age-related sphincter degeneration and also improve continence in the aging Veteran population. This proposal promises to address a critical clinical challenge in the understanding of age-related urethral sphincter muscle complex dysfunction and its pathophysiology as well as to deliver a novel multifunctional pharmacological agent for prevention/ management of this disorder that impacts the quality of life of many older men and women. Our proposal is innovative with novel concepts (sphincter dysfunction related to injury is due to deranged muscle regeneration, excessive collagen deposition and disorganized muscle fiber orientation. Excessive fibrosis is driven by increased Wnt signaling), a novel approach (pharmacological intervention with Wnt signaling antagonist to improve sphincter function) and novel tools (novel high definition manometry and MR-DTI to study sphincter function and myo-architecture in the regenerating muscle). In summation, the proposed study fulfills the objectives described in the award as it has high potential for clinical translation (potential use of W nt antagonists) to maximize functional recovery (urinary continence function) in the aging Veteran population."
"9566372","PROJECT SUMMARY Prevalent, morbid, and costly (>$20 billion/year in 2000), incontinence is a major problem, especially for older adults, in whom the most common type is urgency urinary incontinence (UUI). Ascribed to bladder spasms, UUI's causes are unknown, and therapy remains inadequate. Recent data suggest that one cause is poor bladder control by the brain. In our recent R01 we used biofeedback (BFB) as a probe to explore this. The exciting findings suggest that there are ? 2 brain (pheno)types of UUI; that they respond differently to BFB, and via different mechanisms; and that their response can be predicted. The new study will extend this work to examine mechanisms of drug treatments to identify potentially new targets for therapy. Data suggest that bladder control comprises 3 cerebral circuits which maintain continence by suppressing the voiding reflex in the midbrain. In the phenotype that responded to BFB, the mechanism involved enhancing deactivation of the first brain circuit (medial prefrontal cortex, mPFC) which resulted in less activation of the second circuit (which includes the midcingulate cortex). In the phenotype that was resistant to BFB, no brain changes were seen. Yet, BFB is used less often than drugs to treat UUI. The mechanism(s) that mediate drug response are unknown but likely involve changes in afferent activity ascending to the brain. The proposed study would be the first to address this critical knowledge gap. It is based not only on insights generated from our BFB study, but also on a pilot study of the bladder relaxant fesoterodine and our working model of brain/bladder control. Our overall aim is to use fesoterodine as a probe, to improve our understanding of the brain's role in UUI and identify new targets for therapy. Specific aims are to: (1) test whether efficacy of drug therapy varies by brain phenotype (the two identified in our BFB study or others that this study will identify); (2) confirm that mPFC deactivation is a key therapeutic mechanism, regardless of intervention; (3) determine if drug therapy normalizes brain response as a non-specific reaction to therapy; and (4) use newer MRI techniques to extend our current methods and thereby confirm or refute our model of brain/bladder control. To address these aims, we will randomize 150 women aged ? 60 years to receive 12 weeks of either fesoter- odine or placebo and then switch then to the alternate therapy for another 12 weeks. The study will enable us to correlate the change in CNS activation/deactivation with clinical response to therapy and also to discern whether CNS changes revert as incontinence worsens following withdrawal of therapy (on placebo) and to identify brain predictors and mechanisms of response. This study will provide the first ever data on brain mechanisms involved in UUI response to a drug. Regardless of the results, it will contribute substantially to current understanding and should facilitate development of better targeted therapy."
"9473184","PROJECT SUMMARY Acetylcholine (ACh) is an important neurotransmitter involved in attention, arousal, visual processing, motor control, and motivated behavior. Cholinergic transmission is perturbed in a number of devastating human disorders/diseases, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, major depression, and drug addiction. Muscarinic ACh receptors are GPCRs, whereas nicotinic ACh receptors (nAChRs; the subject of this proposal) are a family of Cys-loop, ligand-gated cation channels. nAChRs exist either as homopentamers containing 5 a7 subunits, or heteropentamers requiring 2 a subunits, 2 b subunits, and a 5th subunit that may be either an a or a b subunit. Studies aimed at probing nAChR function in the vertebrate brain have relied principally on rodent studies, where mouse genetic techniques have permitted key insights. A key gap in the field is the lack of suitable tools for nAChR gene editing. This R21 project will fill that gap via two independent scientific aims. In Aim 1, we will create ? for each key nAChR subunit gene ? a single vector that will catalyze CRISPR-mediated gene editing that results in a loss-of-function mutation. Guide RNA species will be validated in vitro prior to vector construction. Vectors will be further validated in vivo via gene expression analysis and patch clamp electrophysiology. This set of vectors will be useful for brain-region specific nAChR gene editing in any recipient mouse strain, including selectively-bred strains whose genetics cannot be disturbed by crosses to C57BL/6 or other common backgrounds. In Aim 2, we will create a parallel series of vectors to allow for cell type-specific nAChR gene editing. Vetted gRNAs from Aim 1 will be incorporated into a set of vectors that will be introduced into a specialized set of mouse strains that produce Cas9 nuclease in a Cre-dependent manner. As in Aim 1, we will validate this system in vivo using gene expression analyses and patch clamp electrophysiology. Ultimately, these new vectors will greatly expand our molecular toolbox, allowing for wide control over nAChR gene editing in various genetic backgrounds and in specific circuits."

"9392411","Muscles paralyzed by spinal cord injury (SCI) atrophy extensively, are weaker, fatigue more quickly and generate lower specific tension (force produced per unit of cross-sectional area), such that they generate less force in response to maximal motor neuron activation. For individuals with motor-incomplete lesions, interventions that improve specific force and/or fatigue resistance would be obvious opportunities to improve function. A newly recognized cause of impaired specific force production is oxidation/nitrosylation of ryanodine receptors (RyR) which results in dissociation of calstabin and spontaneous opening of RyR thereby impairing RyR gating; the ultimate physiological effect of RyR dysfunction is diminished force of muscle contraction and lower muscle endurance. Small molecules such as S107 bind oxidized/nitrosylated RyR and improve specific force by as much as 50%. Our preliminary data demonstrates extensive oxidation/nitrosylation of RyR in muscle after SCI thus implicating RyR dysfunction in reduced specific force production and endurance of paralyzed muscle after SCI. These changes in RyR are associated with increased expression of NADH oxidase 4 (Nox4) which is a potent source of reactive oxygen species (ROS) that has been linked to RyR. A direct link between Nox4 and oxidation/nitrosylation of RyR is supported by findings that binding of Nox4 to RyR is also increased in muscle after SCI. The overarching objectives of this application are to test the possibility that administration of S107 or a Nox4 inhibitor after SCI will improve skeletal muscle specific tension and endurance, and hence function, and to investigate the role of Nox4 in oxidation/nitrosylation of RyR in skeletal muscle after SCI.  Aim 1. To determine the role of elevated Nox4 expression in the oxidation/nitrosylation of RyR in muscle after spinal cord transection. Hypothesis: oxidation/nitrosylation of RyR after SCI results from increased expression and activity of Nox4. Approach. Aim 1A. We will compare SCI and sham-operated groups over time after a spinal cord transection at various times between 1 and 56 days after SCI. We will examine the temporal relationships between oxidation/nitrosylation of RyR and dissociation of calstabin from RyR with changes in Nox4 expression. Aim 1B: Effects of a conditional knockout of Nox4 in skeletal muscle on muscle strength, specific force, fatigue, RyR oxidation after SCI will be determined. Aim 1C: We will compare muscle force production, specific force, fatigue, RyR oxidation/nitrosylation and binding of RyR to calstabin between spinal cord transected mice treated with a Nox4 inhibitor or vehicle.  Aim 2) To test the effects of S107 on muscle force production and RyR-calstabin binding interactions after spinal cord transection. Hypothesis: administration of S107 will improve muscle specific force and endurance and increase calstabin binding to RyR but will not alter RyR oxidation/nitrosylation. Approach: We will compare muscle specific force, endurance, binding of calstabin to RyR, and RyR oxidation/nitrosylation between SCI groups administered S107 or vehicle.  Aim 3. To A) determine whether S107 or a Nox4 inhibitor improves functional recovery after a contusion SCI. Hypothesis: S107 or a Nox4 inhibitor improves functional recovery in a graded contusion model of mid-thoracic SCI in mice. Approach: Following a mild, moderate or severe contusion spinal cord injury, mice will be treated with the most effective drug (either S107 or GKT137831) from Aims 1 and 2 or vehicle. Effects of the treatment on locomotor function and gait will be determined.  Expected Outcomes and Benefits to Veterans. Knowledge gained from such studies may result in new pharmacologic or rehabilitation treatments to improve function after SCI."
"9516414","Project Summary. The escalating rates of obesity in nursing homes (NHs) present unique challenges to these facilities. Providing appropriate care to obese residents can be costly as obese residents have special care needs and accommodating these needs requires additional investment in equipment and staff time. However, the current case-mix payment systems do not recognize the additional costs associated with obesity (i.e. the case-mix algorithm is not rated on obesity status), and the resulting potential inverse financial incentives may create barriers for obese residents to receive high quality of care. It is important to understand the potential quality barriers faced by obese NH residents because suboptimal care, if existing, will not only impair obese residents' health conditions, but also incur unnecessary costs, such as potentially preventable hospitalizations, on the Medicare program. To date, there has been very limited empirical evidence bearing on this issue. Our prior study provided some preliminary findings that obese residents received lower quality of care than non- obese residents along one specific dimension - the prevention of pressure ulcers. However, the NH quality is multidimensional and quality measures are not necessarily to be correlated. There are no studies examining whether disparity exists in other NH quality outcomes for obese residents, and whether obese residents face barriers in accessing high quality NHs. Thus, the objective of this study is to understand disparities both in access to care and in quality of care experienced by obese residents. Based on an economic conceptual framework, the study has 2 specific aims: 1) Examine the disparity in quality of care, using multiple measures (fall, preventable hospitalizations etc.), received by obese and non-obese residents within the same facility, and whether such disparity varies with the facility ownership, state Medicaid reimbursement rate and market factors; 2) Understand the disparity in access to high quality NHs ? that is, whether obese residents are less likely to be admitted to high quality NHs than non-obese residents ? and the impact of quality report cards. This study is innovative because it is the first one to use a comprehensive set of quality measures to examine quality of care received by obese NH residents; it employs an economic framework to explore different pathways (i.e. care received within a NH and barriers to access to high quality facilities) that can lead to the overall difference in quality of care between obese and non-obese residents; and it explores how the quality gap varies with ?external factors? such as state Medicaid policies and market factors, which will not only provide policy relevant implications, but also provide further evidence on the role of NH in the quality outcomes experienced by obese residents. This proposed research is significant because it addresses an emerging and growing public concern. Furthermore, it will provide information on the needs of care among obese residents and needs of policy interventions, with the goal of reducing health disparities, achieving better care and reducing health care costs."
"9395599","Measuring and understanding the activity of individual neurons is critical for understanding how neuronal circuits function and lead to behavior. Two-photon microscopy of calcium-sensitive indicators has produced insightful data on the role of individual neurons with populations. With the use of head-fixed or miniaturized versions, such optical techniques have lead to links between neural dynamics and behavior. However, these methods have not translated to voltage indicators, so that the understanding of how spikes across populations of cells affects circuits and behavior is lacking. Much of the difficulty is related to the need in two-photon microscopy to scan a small laser focus throughout a volume which results in limited time resolution. Signals from reporters are associated with a neuron because the fluorescence was generated when the laser focus was at the location of that neuron. An alternate strategy based on using multiple colors of indicators to color code neural output is proposed here. This strategy relies entirely on spectral information, so no location information or image formation is required. This enables high-speed data acquisition. This strategy takes advantage of the availability of multiple colors of genetically encoded voltage indicators and associates individual neurons with unique color combinations. A mix of adeno-associated virus vectors, each carrying DNA for a indicator of a particular color, is injected into the brain. Because the infection process is stochastic and neurons are infected by several particles, neurons are labeled by a random combination of colors. In this proposal, the number of colors, delivery methods and analysis of signals is optimized for the identification of individual neurons within a population. For the benchmarking this technology, these novel signals are compared to the performance of multiphoton microscopy and electrophysiology in assays of neural activity."
"9253249","Summary Drug safety issues pose a serious challenge to the health and well-being of patients. The development of our innovative technology aims to address a significant gap in the in vitro assessment of drug-induced cardiotoxicity, which is the number one reason for withdrawals of all marketed drugs as well as the premature termination of promising drug development candidates. Pressured by the enormous social and economic consequence, today?s drug safety professionals are facing daunting challenges to 1) improve accuracy in predicting the cardiac liability of candidate drugs; 2) increase assay throughput to afford earlier evaluation of larger number of compounds; and 3) reduce assay cost to mitigate the fast-rising spending on drug development. Recent advances in human stem cell-derived cardiomyocyte (hSC-CM) research demonstrate significant advantages over traditional in vitro model such as immortalized hERG cell lines. Compared to single-parameter hERG assay, hSC-CM provides an integrated action potential, a powerful biomarker for arrhythmia, from an intact human-based physiologic system. In addition the potential ability to generate unlimited, patient-specific, induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC- CM) opens a tantalizing opportunity to model disease for individual patients, and for ?preclinical? human trials that would closely reflect the diversity of drug responses in the entire population. This has prompted an FDA initiative (Comprehensive In vitro Proarrhythmia Assessment or CiPA) that proposes the use of hSC-CMs for the electrophysiological assessment of proarrhythmia risk?a primary form of cardiotoxicity?for all drugs. Yet despite the pressing need to meet FDA?s impending regulatory requirements, drug safety professionals do not have an effective technology that affords high data quality (single cell resolution, physiological relevance, long-term measurement); high throughput; and low-cost analysis of transmembrane action potential from hSC-CM. Existing technologies, namely the patch clamp (for intracellular electrophysiology) and the planar multiple electrode array (MEA, for extracellular electrophysiology), addresses either data quality or throughput to an extent, but never both. The lack of adequate environmental control for both technologies further reduces the physiological relevance of the results. The novel electrophysiology platform proposed in this STTR application provides a powerful solution that bridges the longstanding gap between high-quality, low throughput intracellular electrophysiology and low-quality, high-throughput extracellular electrophysiology; and for the first time enables the measurement of hSC-CMs under optimal physiological conditions. Central to this system is the seamless integration of two innovative approaches: 1) parallel, nano- fabricated biocompatible electrodes and 2) sensitive, environmentally robust electronics. In combination, our breakthrough technology provides a significantly improved cellular electrophysiology platform, with an immediate and positive impact on the cardiotoxicity assessment using human stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes. This tool, with further development, can afford requirements for even higher throughput, and other electrophysiology applications such as network analysis using stem cell-derived neurons."
"9382131","Title: Coordination of molecular motor activity in intracellular transport and assembly of cytoskeletal architecture. P.I. ? Richard J. McKenney Research Summary Intracellular transport is essential for cellular homeostasis in eukaryotes. Much of this process is carried out by molecular motors that convert the chemical energy from ATP hydrolysis into motion along the actin and microtubule cytoskeletal networks. Decades of research has uncovered structural and molecular details that explain how many of these motors move along their filament tracks in isolation. In the cellular milieu, most of these motors act in concert with complex regulatory machinery that links them to their respective cargos, modulates their motile properties, and dictates spatiotemporal activity. How individual motor output is controlled by this machinery is currently not clear and difficult to dissect in the complex environment of the cell. In addition, many cargos are moved simultaneously by motors of opposite polarity, in a process called bidirectional transport. How individual motors are recruited to cargo, activated, and integrated with other classes of motors presents a large challenge to the field. Further, the activities of disparate motors are harnessed to build and maintain critical cytoskeletal structures such as the mitotic spindle, cilium, and cleavage furrow. How motor and regulatory activities are coordinated to drive the self-assembly of such structures is currently a significant barrier to understanding normal and diseased cellular physiology. This application seeks to develop novel assays and tools to study the complexity of motor recruitment and regulation, bidirectional transport of cargos, and the self-assembly of cytoskeletal structures driven by motors and associated molecules. Our approach to combine biochemistry and single- molecule analysis towards in vitro reconstitutions that test molecular function, and translate our findings into in vivo systems that test hypotheses generated by these reconstitutions, will open up fruitful long-term avenues of research. We propose to: 1) Reconstitute and study the recruitment, regulation, and motility of cytoplasmic dynein and kinesin motors bound to membranous cargo through the endogenous Rab GTPase machinery that is known to link these motors to endocytic vesicles and mitochondria in cells, and 2) Reconstitute and study functions of dynein and kinesin motors that drive the self-assembly of the mitotic spindle. These broad goals build and expand on our expertise and previous work in dissecting the regulatory mechanisms of the cytoplasmic dynein motor, and aim to provide powerful new tools useful towards dissecting complex motor function. Our work will illuminate basic molecular and cell biological principles that drive cellular homeostasis and provide insight into the pathological mechanisms that arise from molecular motor malfunction."
"9341941","Project Summary Washington State University (WSU) proposes research in Kenya to address 7 objectives in Component A, Communicable Disease, of RFA-GH-16-006. The research is organized into three projects that together address the following objectives: Project 1 (i) develop, maintain and expand surveillance systems combining population-based and facility-based demographic, morbidity and mortality surveillance; (ii) develop laboratory capacity and platforms for etiologic investigation and evaluation of novel diagnostic; Project 2 (iii) conduct studies to assess the disease burden, risk factors, and prevention of zoonotic infections; (iv) conduct surveillance and research on antimicrobial resistance; (v) conduct research on the epidemiology and ecology of arboviruses and their vectors; and Project 3 (vi) conduct socio-cultural research on knowledge, attitudes and practice related to infectious disease and acceptance of prevention methods; (vii) develop cost of disease and intervention estimates. To accomplish these objectives, WSU has assembled a team of 20 scientists derived from WSU, University of Nairobi (UON), Emory University, Kenya Medical Research Institute (KEMRI), Kansas State University, and the government of Kenya. In addition, we have enlisted the infrastructural support of KEMRI, UON, and Henry Jackson Foundation. Since 2001, CDC has managed the human demographic surveillance system, rural and urban population-based infectious disease surveillance in Kenya. These platforms and the supporting laboratories were designed to assist in determining the burden of diseases and in conducting disease intervention trials. Here, WSU proposes to start by managing the platforms as-is, but also pilot new approaches to promote their fiscal sustainability. Through the platforms and other surveillance approaches, WSU will investigate the burden and risk factors of endemic and emerging diseases and antimicrobial resistance. In addition, we will conduct intervention studies to address the threats, and engage the government of Kenya to share data and advocate for policy change. Social scientists will work with the disease research team to assess the perceptions of diseases and treatment options, as well as behaviors that may affect human-human and animal-human transmission. To assess the economic burden of disease and cost-effectiveness of interventions, both direct and indirect impacts will be considered. The outcome of this project will be better understanding of level of these threats, and development of interventions that result in improvement of the health of Kenyans and reduction in global health threats."
"9541067","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT International travel may not only increase the risk of infection for an individual traveler, but may also contribute to the global spread of infections. A better understanding of this epidemiologically important population could lead to improved interventions (1) to promote the health of international travelers, and (2) to diminish the spread of infections within home communities. This application focuses on proposed efforts for the Global Travelers' Epidemiology Network (Global TravEpiNet; GTEN). GTEN's mission is to lessen illness among high-risk international travelers, including VFR travelers, and to reduce the likelihood of disease importation into the United States. GTEN is comprised of two components: (1) a consortium of over 20 clinical sites that collects real-time data on pre-travel health care provided across the United States (since inception: over 80,000 records have been collected), and (2) a public health outreach program (?Heading Home Healthy?; www.headinghomehealthy.org) that includes web-tools and educational materials in multiple languages for high risk and VFR travelers, as well as a clinical guidance tool for non-expert providers who deliver the majority of pre-travel care to such travelers. We propose to expand upon the existing infrastructure developed by GTEN in order to (1) answer fundamental questions relating to the health care of US residents who travel internationally, and (2) improve the pre-travel health care provided to vulnerable US populations at highest risk of travel-related illness."
"9565750","Project Summary  The overall goal of this research is to determine how the built environment (BE) in which individuals live, work, and play in on a daily basis influences their health. This proposal will continue a productive line of research into associations among the BE and health in a community-based sample of identical twins who were reared together as children but now reside apart as adults. This unique sample permits us to address the serious methodological problems of self-selection and direction of causation because we will examine changes in both the BE and health over time, free of genetic and shared environmental (family) effects that otherwise introduce biases and residual confounding into research of unrelated individuals studied at one point in time. We couple advanced methods in geospatial data analysis and health behavior measurement with integrated spatial databases to obtain measures of physical activity, eating behaviors, and the BE in a real time and space continuum. In this renewal application, we build on our previous work in three important ways. First, we will expand our sample to include greater diversity in ethnicity/race and socio-economic status (SES) because both of these factors profoundly influence residential selection and health. We will also build on our mostly urbanized sample by recruiting twins from less urbanized areas because the BE is very different between these settings, with implications for health. We hypothesize that identical twins who reside in ?healthier? or more ?walkable? BEs have significantly greater walking and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) levels than co-twins who reside in less walkable BEs. We further hypothesize that walking and MVPA levels will differ between identical twin pairs by ethnicity/race, SES, and urban/rural classification. Second, we will establish a cohort of identical twins that will be followed prospectively to address the direction of causation problem. We hypothesize that twin differences in the home neighborhood BE are associated with twin differences in both walking and MVPA levels over time. We further hypothesize that twin differences in the home BE are associated with twin differences in the number of activity and eating events occurring within and outside the home BE over time. Third, we will integrate behavioral with biologic data to investigate epigenetic signatures in obesity-related measures in identical twins, and how these signatures are associated with exposure to an obesogenic BE and health behaviors. We hypothesize that distinct epigenetic signatures (DNA methylation) will be present in obesity- related measures in identical twins, including twins with and without abdominal obesity, and that these signatures will be associated with exposure to an obesogenic BE and activity and eating behaviors. Our scientific approach integrates models from the behavioral and social sciences with molecular and computational measures in a genetically informed twin research design. Ultimately, our unique methods and measures will lead to new and important insights linking epigenetic, environmental, and behavioral aspects of obesity and chronic disease."
"9451199","Project Summary / Abstract  A fundamental but unsolved question in neuroscience is how specific connections between brain cells (neurons) underlie information processing. Circuits in the cerebral cortex?the part of the mammalian brain that underlies high-level sensory, motor, and cognitive function?consists of tens of thousands of neurons, each of which sends and receives thousands of connections. Perhaps the biggest reason we don't understand the cerebral cortex is that we don't have an actual wiring diagram of any single cortical circuit. But even if we had a wiring diagram, we would need to know what each neuron in a circuit is doing: its physiology. In this proposal, we plan study the functional logic of networks in the visual cortex by examining groups of connected neurons whose responses to visual stimuli have been characterized.  We will combine two techniques to tackle this difficult problem. Connections between neurons will be determined with a modified virus that allows us to specifically labels ensembles of neurons, all of which connect with a single 'target' neuron in each experiment. Once the neurons are labeled, we will use an advanced form of scanning-laser imaging (calcium imaging with two-photon microscopy) that allows us to make movies of each neuron's activity in response to carefully chosen visual stimuli. Together, these tools will allow to probe the functional logic of cortical circuits: the relationship between neuronal function and the wiring between neurons.  The cerebral cortex is a network of networks. There are many different cortical regions each of which has its distinct inputs and outputs and distinct physiological properties. For instance, roughly ten visual cortical areas process different aspects of visual stimuli. We will start by studying the functional logic of wiring within three visual cortical areas: V1, AL and PM. We will then examine the functional logic of connections between these areas. The viral strategy that we employ is currently the only method that allow for both local and inter- areal connection to be studied along with physiology. The data we collect will help us understand feedforward, lateral, and feedback connections in cortical circuits and will form the foundation of new, data-driven models of cortical function."

"9350835","Project Summary. A critical disconnect currently exists between the science that enables discovery of biologic drivers of disease, with the science that enables therapeutic intervention in disease. This disconnect is largely one of chemistry and biophysics, where many of the biomolecular interactions that are involved in regulating cell signaling have proven to be `undruggable' by conventional small molecules. Chief of among biologic targets that have a striking overlap between their validated role in disease and intractability by conventional approaches are transcription factors (TFs). These proteins regulate gene expression programs through formation of protein complexes and, ultimately, sequence-specific binding of DNA stretches in target genes. Despite their validation as drivers in nearly all areas of disease, no chemical class has emerged to interfere with their function outside of the nuclear hormone transcription factor family. My group has recently developed a new chemical platform enabling the synthesis of fully synthetic DNA-Binding Domains (sDBDs), which recapitulate the secondary and tertiary protein structure of basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors. The first validation of this platform has been to mimic the bHLH structure of the Myc/Max heterodimer, which has been a validated driver of oncogenic gene expression programs in many cancers for decades, yet has remained relatively untouched by ligand discovery. Preliminary data presented here establish that sDBDs derived from Myc/Max potently bind consensus E-box DNA sites with comparable affinities to the full-length protein, and directly compete with Myc/Max complex formation on E-box sites in vitro, and interfere with Myc binding to target genes by ChIP-qPCR in situ. These data establish the proof-of-principle for the first chemical class that combines the attributes of synthetic small molecules with the targeting capacity of biologics ? a ?synthetic biologic? - that directly binds DNA to interfere with transcription factor function. While this presents an exciting starting point, we must develop structure activity relationships for this class of molecules as well as validate their ability to reprogram gene expression in cells and animals. The research proposed herein aims to first optimize the structure and function of the sDBDs targeting Myc/Max E-box binding through simultaneous improvements in the stabilization of secondary and tertiary structure, as well as incorporation of additional DNA-binding elements outside of the canonical bHLH binding sites to target larger stretches of DNA. The biologic effects of optimized sDBDs targeting Myc will be explored in Burkitt's Lymphoma, a disease hallmarked by MYC translocation events. Validated cellular models will be employed to identify the genome- wide DNA binding profile of sDBDs, their effects on gene expression and their potential to abrogate oncogenic phenotypes attributed to Myc function in this and other cancers. Together we posit that support of this high-risk goal of directly interfering with transcription factor function through sDBDs has a disproportionately high-reward in an area of biology and disease that has been resistant to most recent advances in science."
"9522460","SUMMARY Dysfunctional mitochondria and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutations are hypothesized to drive aging phenotypes, but the mechanisms by which these age-related defects act are poorly understood. This proposal focuses on the mechanisms linking mitochondrial dysfunction, including mtDNA mutations, to aging phenotypes through the pleiotropic stress response known as cellular senescence. The senescence response is a permanent arrest of cell proliferation, accompanied by phenotypic changes, including the development of a senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). The SASP entails the secretion of a myriad of pro- inflammatory cytokines, angiogenic factors, growth factors and proteases. However, in the case of mitochondrial dysfunction, the secretory and mitotic arrest phenotypes can be partially uncoupled. Depending on the extracellular environment, mitochondrial dysfunction can either drive SASP-like secretion in the absence of mitotic arrest, or can drive a senescence arrest that is notably free of SASP inflammatory components. We propose to use cultured human and mouse cells, and mouse models to critically determine the role of cellular senescence phenotypes in mitochondrial dysfunction-induced aging. Our specific aims are designed to answer the following questions: How does loss of mitochondrial function drive cellular senescence phenotypes? Does the accumulation of mtDNA mutations drive cellular senescence phenotypes in a mouse model, and can the elimination of senescent cells prevent mtDNA-induced tissue dysfunction? Finally, is mitochondrial dysfunction an inducer of cellular senescence phenotypes during normal aging and does a mouse model of delayed aging accumulate fewer senescent cells with age? If successful, our proposed experiments will provide an important link between mitochondrial function and physiological manifestations of aging. In addition to generating important basic knowledge, the experiments will also provide a new targets (dysfunctional mitochondria and senescent cells) for the development of potential interventions into aging and age-related diseases."
"9417498","PROJECT SUMMARY Sepsis accounts for approximately 8% of pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) admissions, with an in-hospital mortality of 25% and an estimated annual cost of $4-5 billion in the United States. Delayed antimicrobial therapy is associated with worse outcomes for pediatric sepsis, but initial signs of sepsis can be non-specific and subtle. Clinicians frequently order blood cultures to aid in diagnosing bacterial sepsis, but universally accepted standards or guidelines to guide decisions around when to obtain blood cultures are not available. Weighed against the potentially disastrous consequences of failing to diagnose sepsis in a timely fashion, blood cultures are generally perceived to be a low-risk screening test. The yield of blood cultures, however, is low (5-15%) and up to half are falsely positive. False positive cultures contribute to patient harm via additional hospital days, unnecessary antibiotics, and increased costs. Unnecessary antibiotic use is a primary driver of antibiotic resistance, which is emerging as a grave threat to human health worldwide. Recently, a novel clinical practice guideline designed to standardize approach to blood cultures in critically ill children safely reduced blood culture use by 46%. In addition, there was a 15% reduction in broad spectrum antibiotic use post- intervention. Subsequent implementation of this program in two other PICUs yielded reductions in blood culture use. The long term objective of this proposal is to determine whether diagnostic stewardship, specifically the appropriate use of blood cultures, can safely reduce antibiotic use and antibiotic resistance in a large and diverse group of hospitals. The specific aims are Aim 1) to implement an evidence-based, clinical practice guideline for evaluation of patients with signs and symptoms of sepsis to decrease blood culture use in PICUs, Aim 2) to evaluate whether a clinical practice will reduce antibiotic use, antibiotic resistance, and Clostridium difficile infection, and Aim 3) to determine whether this clinical practice guideline has an unintended consequence of patient harm. A prospective multicenter quality improvement program will be implemented at 10 hospitals, and will be evaluated using a quasi-experimental design comparing outcome data in pre- and post-periods. The findings could provide evidence that diagnostic stewardship around blood cultures can decrease harm to patients by reducing unnecessary antibiotic use and antibiotic resistance."
"9562651","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Pancreatic cancer is the fourth leading cause of cancer-related deaths in US. Epidemiological data strongly suggest that the heavy drinking is a risk factor for pancreatic cancer. However, the molecular mechanism by which alcohol toxicity damages pancreas is not well understood. The main goal of the application is to examine the molecular mechanisms by which chronic alcohol consumption induces cellular transformation of human normal pancreatic ductal epithelial cells. Genetic variability and environmental exposures can modify the risk of pancreatic cancer. Cellular transformation is regulated by several genetic and epigenetic events. Progenitor cells / cancer stem cells play significant role in cellular transformation, and their emergence is responsible for cancer initiation and progression. We have found that during ethanol-induced cellular transformation, SATB2 gene (a transcription factor) is induced and its induction is directly correlated with the rate of transformation of pancreatic ductal epithelial cells. SATB2 is required for normal mammalian development; however, it is not expressed in normal adult cells. Inappropriate activation of SATB2 gene may cause malignant cellular transformation. SATB2 regulates transcription of pluripotency maintaining factors which are required for sustaining the stem cells capacity for self-renewal. Therefore, understanding the biology of ethanol-induced cellular transformation of normal pancreatic ductal epithelial cells is very significant for the management of pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer. We hypothesize that ethanol toxicity induces human pancreatic normal ductal epithelial cell transformation and enhances pancreatic carcinogenesis by up-regulating SATB2, and inhibition of SATB2 expression in ethanol-transformed cells suppresses their tumorigenic potential. Aim 1. To examine the molecular mechanisms by which ethanol induces cellular transformation of pancreatic normal ductal epithelial cells in vitro. Aim 2. To examine whether SATB2 mediates ethanol-induced cellular transformation. Aim 3. To assess whether induction or overexpression of SATB2 in human pancreatic normal ductal epithelial cells mediates pancreatic carcinogenesis in Balb C Nude mice. Aim 4. To examine whether chronic ethanol exposure regulates pancreatic carcinogenesis in vivo. The molecular mechanisms by which ethanol induces transformation of pancreatic normal ductal epithelial cells will be examined using qRT-PCR, ChIP-Seq, Western blot analysis, RNA-Seq and miRNA arrays. The expression of SATB2 in the pancreas isolated from human normal and alcoholic individuals will be compared. Gain and loss of SATB2 functional studies will be performed in vitro and in vivo. Ethanol, acetaldehyde, ADH, ALDH and CYP2E1 in the blood and tissues will be measured. Finally, KrasG12D/SATB2+/+, and KrasG12D/SATB2-/- mice will be generated, for the first time, to examine the involvement of SATB2 in ethanol-induced carcinogenesis. In conclusion, our novel studies will provide significant information about the ethanol-induced cellular transformation leading to pancreatic cancer."
"9278045","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Project 6 ? Market Learning and Health Care Disparities Health care outcomes depend crucially on whether patients are able to access providers with high clinical quality. This project studies the role of market learning in health care ? the process by which markets, driven by patients and their decision-making partners like ambulance drivers and referring physicians, allocate patients to providers. When market learning favors high-quality health care providers, patients experience better health outcomes, and, moreover, providers are incentivized to improve quality because their patient volumes depend on it. An implication is that socioeconomic disparities in market learning can lead to disparities in treatment quality and thus health outcomes. The conventional wisdom is that patients and their surrogates are poorly informed about quality variations, limiting the scope for market learning. Our preliminary work suggests, however, that market learning operates: high-quality hospitals tend to be larger and are more likely to grow than their low-quality peers. This work expands on the preliminary exercises in several ways to paint a nuanced picture of where (and for whom) health care markets raise clinical quality. This project takes two approaches to analyze health care markets: the first assesses hospitals' market share at a point in time and over time, and how that share correlates with a broad set of quality metrics; the second builds econometric models of the hospital choice of the patient to estimate how much value patients place on hospital quality. Quality includes clinical outcomes, clinical processes, and patient satisfaction. The project's first Specific Aim investigates the role of patient attributes like socioeconomic group and insurance in enabling patients to reach high quality hospitals. It focuses in particular on vulnerable populations, like those with chronic illness or those from areas with poor population health. This Aim will show how health care markets function for socioeconomic groups and how markets affect health care disparities. The second Aim expands the scope of the market analysis to cancer patients. Health care markets can potentially function better for cancer than emergency conditions because cancer patients have more time to decide on a provider, widening their scope for choice. This Aim will provide the first estimates of how markets function for cancer and how they compare to markets for acute conditions. The project's third Aim considers technology as an additional factor that determines market allocation. It will estimate the extent to which markets favor technology above and beyond quality, how patients trade off between technology and quality, and how patients' preferences for technology affect clinical outcomes. Finally, we synthesize the findings of these analyses together with those of other Projects within the program project to assess the role of markets in relation to other tools in driving the value and quality of care delivery to improve the health of an aging population."
"9352770","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Medical error is one of the leading causes of death in the US. The study and reduction of medical errors have become a major concern in healthcare today. It is believed that medical error reporting systems could be a good resource to share and to learn from errors if medical error data are collected in a properly structured format and are useful for the detection of patterns, discovery of underlying factors, and generation of solutions. Effectively gathering information from previous lessons and timely informing the subsequent action are the two major goals for the design, development and utilization of such a system. The Common Formats (CFs) suggested by AHRQ tend to unify the future reporting format, which holds promise in improving data consistency and reducing unsafe conditions through lessons learned. However, effective gathering medical incident data does not merely rely on a unified structure. To be able to learn from previous lessons, it heavily depends upon the quality reports and learning features offered by systems. Medical incident data are always the key components and invaluable assets in patient safety research. The long term goal of the project is to understand the occurrence and causes of medical incidents in real practice and to develop interventions based on collection of incident reports to minimize the recurrence of similar incidents that have been reported. The objective of this application is to improve the utilization f voluntary reporting systems that each healthcare institution has been put in use by developing a learning toolkit that can systematically collect and analyze incident reports, automatically link historical reports with WebM&M, the highest quality of voluntary reports and expert reviews in patient safety. As moving toward CFs, the researchers propose a user-centered, learning-supportive, and ontological approach that will help reporters generate complete and accurate reports through user-friendly guidance and offer timely comments and relevant peer reviews through educational tools during and after incident reporting. The researchers employ a case-based reasoning and natural language processing techniques to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the knowledge-based toolkit which helps reporters improve the communication about patient safety through clear working definitions and advance training that builds knowledge about the safety culture and then provides continuing education through the system. The project holds promise in revolutionizing the design of voluntary medical incident reporting systems from an incident data repository to an advanced resource promoting complete and accurate incident reporting and learning toward a just and learning culture."

"9456073","Project Summary Description: Stroke is the fifth leading cause of death in the US and the number one cause of severe long- term adult disability. In addition to initiatives dedicated to reducing morbidity and mortality associated with stroke outcomes, there are initiatives to reduce stroke risk factors at the community level. In order to reduce the burden of stroke on the population, identifying modifiable risk factors, and demonstrating the reduction of stroke risk through risk reduction efforts is a high priority. While much is known about long-term stroke risk factors, such as hypertension, diabetes, and atherosclerotic disease, much less is known about short-term risk factors, or triggers, for stroke. Infection, particularly severe infection, has been identified as a potential risk factor and trigger for stroke. The role of sepsis as a risk factor for stroke has not been well described. Our recent analyses of administrative datasets has identified sepsis as a risk factor for stroke, however, while there is a low absolute risk of stroke post sepsis, those who are at risk remain at risk up to a year after their sepsis event. Additionally, racial disparities in sepsis and stroke have been identified, with black patients twice as likely to develop sepsis or stroke as white patients. Prior research has found that even while adjusting for poverty or medically underserved areas, black patients remain at higher risk of both sepsis and stroke, indicating a link between racial and geographic disparities with sepsis and stroke. The role racial and geographic disparities play in the relationship between sepsis and subsequent risk of stroke is not well- understood. The overall goal of this project is to investigate sepsis as a risk factor for stroke and identify risk factors of sepsis patients that increase their risk of stroke. The proposed research will use data from the REGARDS study (2003-ongoing), a unique longitudinal, nationally representative sample of people with detailed information on prior stroke comorbidities, post-stroke comorbidities and long-term outcomes. Furthermore, an ancillary REGARDS study investigated sepsis hospitalizations, providing valuable information on sepsis hospitalizations that can be investigated as risk factors for stroke. Individual and community level characteristics will be investigated, as well as potential interactions that increase the risk post-sepsis for stroke. The proposed NINDS Small Research Grant will allow us to investigate the role of sepsis as a risk factor for stroke, and identify characteristics of sepsis patients at greatest risk for a stroke, which can aide in patient selection for future research on decreasing the risk of stroke post sepsis in at risk individuals."
"9565792","ABSTRACT Tracheal deficiency of any cause represents a potentially fatal process. Presently there are no available substitutes for the trachea and it remains one of the few vital organs that can neither be reconstructed from other tissues nor effectively transplanted. Researchers have begun to explore the possibility of organ replacements from scaffolds (decellularized trachea) that can then be transplanted to a patient. However, these first cases have been troubled by a range of serious problems all ultimately linked to a lack of healing. We believe that the lack of healing could be related to the secreted protein thrombospondin-1 (TSP1) an identified anti-angiogenic agent that binds to matrix and to cell receptors and is induced by healing tracheal cells. We found that limiting TSP1 signaling through agents that prevent its binding to a specific cell membrane receptor, CD47, which is expressed on tracheal epithelial, cartilage and vascular cells, increases cell restoration of decellularized tracheal scaffolds and tissue healing or transplanted decellularized tracheal scaffolds. We have developed several technologies that target and suppress the maladaptive TSP1-CD47 signal including a CD47 specific antibody and a CD47 specific peptide. In tracheal cells we will test these technologies to increase cellular restoration of decellularized 2- and 3-D tracheal scaffolds. Bench top results will inform experiments to test these novel engineered tracheal transplants to heal tracheal loss in rodent and canine models of orthotopic tracheal transplantation. As humanized versions of CD47 targeting technologies are in development and, in the case of CD47 antibodies, in clinical trials results from this proposal will support accelerated translation into the clinic."
"9568096","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): CD103+ dendritic cells (CD103+ DCs) are a critical immune subset that resides in nonlymphoid organs in the mouse such as skin, liver and lung. This DC population migrates to lymph nodes to induce adaptive immune responses and is notably proficient in cross-presentation of exogenous antigen to cytotoxic CD8+ T cells. Because of their tissue residence and function, CD103+ DCs are perfectly situated to regulate immune responses to tumors. However, little is understood about their role in cancer. CD103+ DCs are homologous to human tissue CD141+ DCs and DCs generated in GM-CSF for cancer therapy, and provide a genetically tractable system to understand these important DC populations. Recently, our lab and others found CD103+ DCs have a unique developmental pathway dependent on the cytokine GM-CSF, the signal transducer and activator of transcription STAT5 and the transcriptional regulator Id2. This signaling pathway correlates with enhanced DC-mediated tumor immunity. By contrast, we found that the tumor-associated cytokine IL-6 represses Id2 expression in DCs via STAT3 signaling, rendering reduced DC-mediated tumor immunity. The cellular and molecular mechanisms by which STAT5 and STAT3 control CD103+ DC functional responses remain unclear. These gaps in knowledge are important to address to provide better use of DCs in immunotherapy. Based on our data, we hypothesize that GM-CSF-STAT5 and IL-6-STAT3 signaling have opposite roles in regulating DC anti-tumor activity via their control of Id2 expression in DCs. We will test this hypothesis wit 3 project aims. In Aim 1, we will delineate mechanisms by which tissue- resident DCs stimulate anti-tumor immunity by investigating the roles for STAT5 and its target gene Id2 in CD103+ DCs. We will study whether and how STAT5 and Id2 control CD103+ DC maturation, antigen presentation, T lymphocyte stimulation, pre-DC accrual in nonlymphoid tissue, and DC-mediated anti-tumor activity. In Aim 2, we will elucidate DC-intrinsic signaling mechanisms that regulate DC function in melanoma tumors. We will investigate roles for STAT3 in DCs in Id2 downregulation, immune responses to melanoma and melanoma combination immunotherapy. In Aim 3, we will examine mechanisms by which STAT5 and STAT3 regulate Id2 expression in DC development. We will evaluate whether and how STAT5 and STAT3 control chromatin modifications, co-factor recruitment and RNA polymerase II association at the Id2 promoter in vivo. We anticipate this project to reveal cellular and molecular mechanisms by which CD103+ DC anti-tumor activity is regulated, paving the way for rational investigation into pathways controlling related human DC populations. This information could ultimately provide new opportunities to manipulate DCs in cellular therapy, cancer and/or immune disease."
"9552310","Project Summary/Abstract: There is a clear need for well-validated biomarkers for Parkinson's disease (PD) to aid early detection, more precise diagnosis, and clinical management. Numerous candidate markers are emerging, for example, spurred by initiatives such as the Parkinson's Disease Biomarker Program (PDBP) launched by the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke. One promising path to biomarker discovery involves the use of multimodal neuroimaging to reveal neuropathophysiologic characteristics of PD. PD involves a severe loss of dopamine producing neurons, which is expected to lead to downstream changes in brain function and structure, some of which manifest through in vivo neuroimaging (Politis, 2014). Identifying robust neuroimaging alterations in symptomatic PD patients creates an opportunity to assess the role of such changes for tracking disease progression and eventually to investigate whether similar changes emerge during the prodromal period. Biomarker discovery from a massive set of multimodal neuroimaging features depends critically on the development and application of advanced analytic techniques.  In previous research (U18 NS082143), we developed a suite of analytic tools for cross-sectional multimodal neuroimaging data to accurately dissociate patients with mild to moderate PD from healthy control subjects. In this highly successful discovery phase, we used large-scale magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI), and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), and we identified three parsimonious panels of strongly predictive multimodal imaging markers. The first panel consists of 24 functional and structural markers (MRI, DTI, and rs-fMRI), which collectively reflect thalamic and limbic system alterations (e.g. hippocampus, amygdala, orbitofrontal cortex, and cingulate gyrus). The second identifies 23 markers, resulting from an analysis that includes more detailed coverage of the basal ganglia. Lastly, we identified a 15- feature structural panel (MRI and DTI), which we expect to be less susceptible to effects from PD medications. Long-term, each panel may offer advantages in practice. We embedded in our selection processes methods to promote reproducibility and model parsimony, while targeting high accuracy.  In this new project, we will further evaluate the markers discovered in our previous research for validation and possibly refinement. We also seek to understand changes in these markers in distinct sets of patients who are on and off of their usual PD medications, to investigate the ability of these cross-sectional and new longitudinal markers to forecast progression, and to determine associations between clinical symptoms and the emergent imaging markers. A major advantage of this project is that we have three independent data sets, two of which have longitudinal scans, enabling further discovery and validation. The data come from the Parkinson's Progression Markers Intiative (PPMI) and from two studies conducted under the PDBP."
"9348615","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite widespread recognition of pervasive patient safety problems in the U.S. health care system, research to develop feasible, scalable solutions has lagged, particularly in the ambulatory setting. The need for new approaches to improve safety is especially pressing in the care of ambulatory patients using high-risk immunosuppressive medications, as reports of preventable adverse events among this category of drugs have increased. To date, no studies have carefully defined the epidemiology of these safety risks. The proposed Advancing Safety Process Innovation Using Registries (ASPIRE) project will use advanced electronic health record (EHR) data analytics to define the magnitude of ambulatory patient safety errors and adverse events for patients receiving high risk medications (Aim 1). We will also characterize disparities in these risks across race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and medical complexity. Three categories of patient safety processes will be examined: 1) preventive practices that reduce adverse medication events, 2) safety monitoring for patients using high-risk immunosuppressive medications, and 3) management of abnormal results from medication toxicity monitoring. These findings will be used to inform the development of eMeasures, a new approach to quality measurement that uses automatically extracted EHR information to give clinicians and health systems information regarding specific patient safety problems (Aim 2). We will use eMeasurement standards, including the Quality Data Model (QDM), Health Quality Measures Format (HQMF) and other structured coded terminologies to develop, specify and test system-wide prototype eMeasures. HIT-solutions such as eMeasures that can be applied across EHR data repositories serve as a foundation for a continuous learning health care system, as envisioned by the Institute of Medicine.

It is the most common cause of sudden ON-related vision loss, occurring worldwide, and affecting more than 10,000 Americans every year; there are no clinically effective treatments. Every previous NAION clinical treatment trial has failed. We have created not only a rodent model of NAION (rNAION) but even more importantly, the first nonhuman primate model of NAION (pNAION) and have developed analytical tools to precisely and accurately measure structural and functional improvements after potential neuroprotective treatments. Our previous work demonstrated that Prostaglandin J2 (PGJ2) significantly reduces ON damage and improves function when given several hours after ischemia in nonhuman primates. This is the first drug shown to do so. However, patients with NAION often present days after symptoms begin. Thus, we must identify a treatment that will improve visual function even when begun several days after symptom onset. If PGJ2 is still effective when given several days after the development of optic nerve ischemia in this model, then it is likely to be effective in cases of human NAION. We recently found that inflammation plays a key role in NAION and hypothesize that targeted therapies are a key to effective NAION treatment. Our team includes a bioengineer who has revolutionized the use of nanoparticles in human disease treatment. We have discovered that dendrimer nanoparticles can `home in' on the ON lesion in both rNAION and pNAION and can be designed to release their compound over a prolonged time period, enabling precise, targeted, long-term drug delivery, potentially enhancing a drug's effectiveness. Our multidisciplinary team has now attached PGJ2 to dendrimer nanoparticles (D-PGJ2) and tested it in rNAION. We have found that D-PGJ2 protects retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) after ON ischemia, with a potency at least equivalent to intravitreal administration of the free drug, reducing the risks of intraocular administration. Our proposal has two specific aims. Each aim uses the pNAION model. We evaluate treatment effectiveness by in vivo imaging, electrophysiology, immunohistochemistry, and quantitative analysis of RGC and axon survival. 1. Determine the time window of opportunity for efficacy of a single intravitreal injection of PGJ2. We will administer soluble PGJ2 intravitreally at different times after pNAION induction and identify how long after NAION presents that PGJ2 is neuroprotective. 2. Determine if nanoparticle-linked PGJ2 (D-PGJ2) preserves RGCs and improves visual functional recovery after pNAION without systemic or ocular toxicity. We will determine if D-PGJ2's cell-specific targeting and sustained drug release can provide greater neuroprotection and functional recovery than an intravitreal injection of PGJ2 after pNAION induction, without the inherent potential risks of an IVT injection."
"9444212","The 2',5'-oligoadenylate (2-5A) synthetase (OAS)-RNase L system is a robust interferon (IFN)-inducible antiviral pathway that contributes to the survival of higher vertebrates against both RNA and DNA viruses. Accordingly, viruses have acquired and evolved a multitude of mechanisms to antagonize OAS-RNase L. During the past 5 years, we established roles for RNase L in IFN signaling, inflammasome activation and autophagy. Yet there remains much to be learned about how RNase L suppresses viral infections, how viruses evade these enzymes, and how the host recovers from RNase L activation. In particular, our knowledge of how RNase L is regulated through its protein kinase-like domain, how RNase L mediates cell death from ADAR1 deficiency, how the RNase L inhibitor (ABCE1 aka RLI) functions, and how RNase L activates the NLRP3 inflammasome is still fragmentary. Therefore, the proposed continuation of this project will systematically investigate the major outstanding questions about this critically important host antiviral pathway. The unifying theme of this application concerns how RNase L function is regulated beyond its activation by 2-5A, in particular through its protein kinase-like (PKL) domain, to control viral infections and inflammation. Our findings lead to the hypothesis that the OAS-RNase L system is an integral part of the host immune system that must be tightly regulated to eliminate viruses while also limiting its harmful pro-inflammatory effects. Our specific aims are: (1) To study the impact of the RNase L PKL domain on cells and viruses we will evaluate recently identified small molecule inhibitors, enhancers and their derivatives on RNase L activity, determine the ability of the small molecules to control viral infections, and investigate effects of the RNase L inhibitors on cell death caused by ADAR1 deficiency. (2) To investigate how the ATP-binding cassette member, ABCE1 (RLI), limits RNase L activity, we will determine precisely how ABCE1 interacts with RNase L to inhibit its activity, establish how the host cells ramps up RNase L activity during viral infections by caspase-mediated cleavage of ABCE1, and determine the ability of ABCE1 to counteract cellular toxicity of double stranded RNA by inhibiting RNase L. (3) To probe the mechanism of NLRP3 inflammasome activation by RNase L, we will identify and characterize RNase L-cleaved viral RNA activators of the NLRP3 inflammasome, determine effects of the small RNA cleavage products on inflammasome activation, and determine the impact of RNase L inhibitor drugs on viral mediated inflammation in vivo. Viral infections remain a serious threat to human health worldwide. Despite viral countermeasures, the OAS-RNase L system has a major impact against many types of pathogenic viruses. These studies emphasize how central and important it is to regulate RNase L in order to mediate the balance between antiviral activity and cell death. It is believed that a better understanding of the viral and host factors that regulate RNase L activity may eventually lead to novel and improved therapeutic approaches for treating established and emerging viral infections in the human population."
"9481620","PROJECT SUMMARY Pain is the most common and most costly neurological disorder in HIV-1/AIDS patients, yet current pain treatment provides only symptomatic management that is often ineffective. Lack of deep, mechanistic understanding of the underlying mechanism of HIV-associated pain has significantly impeded the development of needed effective, rationale-based approaches for pain control in HIV patients. Emerging evidence suggests a crucial role for neuron-astrocyte interactions in the spinal dorsal horn (SDH; the pain processing center in the spinal cord) in the pathogenesis of HIV-associated pain. However, the mechanism that mediates these intercellular interactions is largely unknown. Our work prior and preliminary studies suggest that gp120 elicits exosome-based signals to mediate bidirectional neuron-astrocyte communication in the SDH. Importantly, the exosome pathway is up-regulated in the SDH of the HIV patients with pathological pain. Pharmacological inhibition of exosome secretion in the SDH blocks the expression of gp120-induced pain. We propose that exosome-mediated neuron-astrocyte interactions play a critical role in gp120-induced pain pathogenesis. Specifically, we hypothesize that gp120 stimulates exosome-based secretion of Wnt signaling protein from SDH neurons, which then stimulates astrocytes to release exosomes that in return feedback to SDH pain processing neurons to promote central sensitization. We will use an interdisciplinary approach of conditional knockout, mosaic analysis, patch clamp recording and behavioral analysis to test this hypothesis. The mechanistic insights gained from this project will facilitate the development of novel therapies for HIV- associated pain targeting this underlying exosome-mediated pathogenic process."
"9565758","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Long Life Family Study (LLFS), established in 2005 in response to an NIA RFA, enrolled families enriched for exceptional longevity (EL), to discover factors that contribute to healthy aging and survival. From 2006 to 2009, LLFS enrolled 539 sibships (G1), their offspring (G2) and spouses (total 4,953). Comparison with a referent cohort reveals that LLFS families have strong exceptional clustering of EL. The G2 offspring have a variety of Healthy Aging Phenotypes (HAPs), defined as an unusually low age-specific prevalence of one or more specific conditions or risk factors, compared to population-based cohorts suggesting enrichment of shared (possibly genetic) protective effects in LLFS families. In the second funding period (2010-2013), we conducted a 2.5 million SNP GWAS (dbGaP phs000397); developed a high-throughput technique and sequenced ~450 candidate genes and replicated many variants and found additional ones associated with Healthy Aging Phenotypes (HAP) and longevity. 54% of LLFS G1 and 92% of G2 remain alive. Participant retention has been 94%. We now propose a third funding period to conduct a second in-person examination (V2) to prospectively study rates of change in HAPs with age and identify genetic and other factors contributing to HAPs and longevity. We hypothesize that EL and HAPs entail common and rare variants that individually have modest effects, but which in combinations strongly influence longevity and specific HAPs, and may only be detectable in family studies enriched for HAPs, such as LLFS. HAPs evaluated at the initial in-person visit show strong linkage peaks which are not explained by common haplotypes interrogated by GWAS (HLODs ranging from 6.0-45.1). These are likely driven by rare, lineage-private alleles that will only be found by sequencing specific families, and may point to important new biology. Specific Aim 1 is to conduct a second in-home examination on all surviving LLFS participants. Specific Aim 2 is to analyze cross-sectional and longitudinal phenotypes. The goal is to identify pathways for EL and HAPs by characterizing the shared and distinct LLFS phenotypes and environmental factors. We will characterize individual longitudinal patterns of HAPs to identify subgroups showing similar patterns and exceptional phenotypes. We will test whether these HAPs are heritable, and test for differences with internal and external referent groups. Specific Aim 3 is to find genes/variants associated with cross-sectional and longitudinal phenotypes using a) Whole Exome Sequencing to comprehensively search for coding variants associated with HAPs and EL and b) Targeted Regulatory Sequencing of regions under linkage peaks for HAPs in selected families showing the strongest linkage evidence. Specific Aim 4 is to replicate our genetic and epidemiological findings in other aging study cohorts. This study could lead to the discovery of pathways and potential therapeutic/prevention targets affecting HAPs and EL. A Data Management and Coordinating Center and 4 Field Centers comprise the major components of the LLFS. This renewal application is submitted by the Duke Uni./Uni. of Southern Denmark Field Center."
"9520715","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Chronic inflammation (CI) as defined by chronic elevation in serum inflammatory markers such as C-reactive protein (CRP) and Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is a known risk for the development of adverse health outcomes in older adults, including mortality, frailty, chronic disease, and mobility declines. Despite this, little is known about how best to measure CI. Because of the heterogeneity of CI in older adults, and complexity of etiology, few if any interventions have been developed that specifically target CI and downstream consequences such as mobility decline. Our overarching hypothesis states that decreasing inflammatory signaling over a period of several months will decrease serum levels of inflammatory markers and improve mobility. In order to adequately test this hypothesis in a definitive clinical trial, a great deal of information related in inflammation, mobility and anti- inflammatory interventions must be determined. We propose, through 4 specific aims, to develop the team and data necessary to ultimately design and implement a definitive, multi-site clinical trial in older adults with CI that aims to improve mobility through anti-inflammatory treatment strategies. We have established a highly experienced collaborative research team with expertise in clinical trials development, chronic inflammation biology, measurement, and analysis, mobility measurement and analysis, and recruitment of old adults into clinical studies. The PI, coordinating center, pharmacy analytical team, and recruitment site will be at Johns Hopkins University. Other recruitment sites will be at the University of Michigan, University of Nebraska Medical Center, and Duke University. These sites were chosen based on their recruitment experience, availability of aging research registry, and expertise of co-investigators in CI or mobility. The Biorepository and Measurement Core will be at the University of Vermont under the leadership of Russ Tracy, PhD. Dr. Tracy has long standing expertise in CI measurement in population studies of older adults. The first aim is to further develop and integrate this team and infrastructure necessary to develop a definitive multisite trial. Aim 2 is designed to inform a definitive clinical trial design on CI and mobility through the development and refinement of mobility and inflammatory measurements, compilation of an evidence base on which to design and target a large-scale CI intervention, and through the identification of safe and potentially effective anti-inflammatory agents. Aim 3 was designed to inform a definitive clinical trial design through a series of pilot trials of oral anti- inflammatory agents, including lactoferrin, zinc gluconate, and losartan. These pilot studies will help to develop the definitive trial infrastructure, formalize recruitment and measurement procedures, and identify safe and potentially effective interventions. Finally, Aim 4 articulates the group's road map towards a `shovel ready' definitive clinical trial that will be built on the data generated in aims 2 and 3 ad on the study team and infrastructure developed during the 3 year timeline. At the end of this 3 year study, the compiled research team full expects to have a definitive clinical trial of CI and mobility in older adults ready for implementation."
"9305464","Summary MMPs and ADAMs are currently under intensive investigation as novel biomarkers and potential therapeutic targets for the early detection and treatment of human cancers. However, most of the current techniques to detect MMPs/ADAMs are laborious and time-consuming, require the use of labels or sophisticated instruments, and/or have low specificity, which results in their limited diagnostic utility. Hence, improved analytical capability for their more rapid, sensitive, selective, and cost-effective detection remains a high priority. Our research effort of this 3-year R15 project is mainly focused on addressing such important aspects of the current substrate-based MMP/ADAM assay by demonstrating a novel, label-free, real-time, and multiplexed nanopore sensing system for the simultaneous quantification of the activities of multiple MMPs/ADAMs. This is the first but a crucial step toward our long-term project goal, i.e., to develop a cost-effective, portable device for profiling MMPs/ADAMs in serum samples for potential point-of-care early cancer detection and diagnosis. Aim 1: Demonstrate the feasibility of utilizing our proposed real-time label-free nanopore sensing strategy as an effective generic approach for the sensitive and accurate quantitative determination of the activities of MMPs/ADAMs. For this purpose, during the phase I period of this project, we will use ADAM-9 (a biomarker for pancreatic cancer) and ?-hemolysin protein nanopore as a model system to systematically examine the effects of various factors, including the substrate peptides, experimental conditions, and the inner surface functions of the nanopore, on ADAM-9 activity measurement. Further, we will study the sensor selectivity, investigate ADAM-9 inhibition, determine ADAM-9 kinetics, construct dose-response curve, etc.; Aim 2: Build on the nanopore-based ADAM-9 detection methodology developed in aim #1 to develop multiplexed nanopore sensors for the simultaneous quantification of the activities of multiple MMPs/ADAMs. Such a sensing system which uses a panel of MMPs/ADAMs instead of a single protease as cancer biomarkers can improve diagnosis accuracy and minimize false positives. Two types of multiplex systems will be constructed and evaluated: one involves the use of an array of nanopores and multiple substrates for different MMPs/ADAMs, while the other employs a single nanopore and a single substrate which contains multiple cleavage sites for different MMPs/ADAMs. Aim 3: Analyze mock serum samples. To proof-of-concept demonstrate the feasibility of utilizing our developed nanopore sensing platform for cancer detection and diagnosis, the multiplex nanopore sensor developed in aim #2 will be used to analyze 5 simulated clinical serum samples spiked with MMP-7, MMP-14, ADAM-9, and ADAM17 at concentrations / activities similar to those found in healthy people, pancreatic cancer, and ovarian cancer patients at various stages."

"9390282","PROJECT SUMMARY T-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) is an aggressive hematologic cancer in which novel more effective antileukemic drugs are needed for the treatment of patients with chemotherapy resistant disease. In this context the identification of activating mutations of NOTCH1 in over 60% of T-ALL has brought great interest to the development of targeted anti- NOTCH1 therapies in the treatment of this disease. However, early efforts to target NOTCH1 in the clinic have been hampered by limited antitumor activity. We have demonstrated that NOTCH1 is a critical regulator of cell growth and proliferation and identified MYC, the PI3K-AKT pathway and leukemia cell metabolism as critical effectors of the oncogenic program downstream of NOTCH1. Our central hypothesis is that leukemia persistence, disease progression and relapse are driven by signaling, genetic, epigenetic and metabolic circuits that bypass the antileukemic effects of NOTCH1 signaling. Here we will: (i) dissect molecular mechanisms wiring NOTCH1 with oncogenic transcriptional programs; (ii) functionally analyze the role of long-range enhancers in NOTCH1-induced transformation; (iii) explore the role of tumor microenvironment signals, metabolic and epigenetic plasticity as determinants of the therapeutic response to anti-NOTCH1 therapies and (iv) identify and functionally characterize new drug targets and antileukemic drugs synergistic with NOTCH inhibition for the treatment of T-ALL."
"9338245","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cell fate specification is imposed by transcriptional regulators that activate cell type specific gene expression patterns. Many of these master regulators are conserved from invertebrates to vertebrates, making the Drosophila eye an excellent model system in which to address this process. This proposal will investigate the Drosophila zinc finger transcription factor Glass (Gl), which appears to act as a key determinant in controlling the developmental switch from neuronal precursors to photoreceptor cell types. In gl mutants, eye progenitor cells initiate neuronal differentiation as detected by the presence of neuronal markers, but fail to express photoreceptor-specific genes, extend axons aberrantly into the brain, and die before reaching adulthood. We hypothesize that characterizing the role of Gl in photoreceptor differentiation will reveal novel molecular features underlying eye development. These findings will have translational implications in developing stem cell-based therapies for patients suffering from retinal degenerative diseases. The first aim is to identify the specific stages of photoreceptor development that require Gl function. Premature cell death has prevented a careful analysis of this requirement and it is presently not known if Gl is required at later stages for the differentiation and maintenance of photoreceptors or if its only role is to ac as an early determinant that activates the photoreceptor transcriptional network. To address this question we will inactivate gl expression at late stages, and examine the fate of cells incapable of inducing cell death in a gl mutant background. The second aim will determine if Gl is sufficient to induce photoreceptor development in Drosophila or mammalian cells. Using genetic tools we will misexpress Gl in fly tissues and determine by phenotypic analysis, immunohistochemistry and gene expression profiling if it can induce photoreceptor-specific genes or traits. Gl was shown to bind to vertebrate rhodopsin promoters making it a potentially powerful tool with which to induce gene expression changes in mammalian cells. Gl shares homology with an uncharacterized human zinc finger protein ZNF500, which is also highly expressed in the retina. We propose to misexpress Gl or ZNF500 together with neuronal inducers in mouse embryonic stem cells to determine whether it can activate the expression of photoreceptor-specific genes. In the third aim we will use an RNAi strategy to investigate the role of each of the identified direct targets of Gl activation in photoreceptor development. As many of these genes remain uncharacterized, we expect to identify novel factors that contribute to photoreceptor recruitment, differentiation, survival or axon targeting."
"9564544","Primary users of the 500 MHz who are associated with RCMI program are Profs. Mahesh Lakshman, Ranajeet Ghose, Ruth Stark and Barbara Zajc. These investigators are involved in research in chemistry with an emphasis on the structure of biological molecules related to cell function and disease. At present, the Unity Inova 500 NMR spectrometer console has only one full band radio frequency channel (U+ Direct Synthesis type). The second radiofrequency channel is 1H only (U+ HI' type). Because of this the use of the spectrometer is limited to only to a few NMR pulse techniques. In order to improve its utility, the console needs to be upgraded to two U+ Direct Synthesis Full Band or to a console that can handle two high band and two low band channels. At the present configuration, no double resonance experiments involving two high band frequencies (e.g. 1H and 19F) or triple resonance experiments can be performed. The requested upgrade for the 500 NMR spectrometer involves integration to two high band channels and an additional low band channel with a waveform generator. This will handle an inverse probe that is capable of performing triple resonance (1H-13C-19F) experiments as well as two-dimensional 19F-1H correlation experiments. Inverse probes offer impressive 1H sensitivity for inverse detected experiments and have the capabilities for decoupling over the broadband frequency range. The inner coil is tuned to 1H or tunable from 1H - 19F (depending on probe model), and outer coil is tunable over the frequency range 15N - 31P. Because of this, the sensitivity of 1H NMR is enhanced by a factor of 2 in a one-dimensional experiment. The sensitivity gained in two-dimensional 1H-13C HMQC and 1H-13C HSQC experiments, compared to a normal HETCOR experiment, can be up to 8 times greater. HMQC and HSQC experiments are extremely useful for structure determination of bio-molecules and organic compounds. The gain sensitivity will reduce research time and expenses needed to synthesize the organic metabolites and the DNA adducts. To install a third channel an additional de-coupler has to be incorporated. This requires the integration of the following hardware to the current 500-UI console. These include a 20-600 MHz RF transmitter module, a 300 W (12-200 MHz) broadband linear amplifier module, a 150 W (200-245 MHz) broadband linear amplifier module and a 50 W 1H/19F linear amplifier module. The upgrade also includes a waveform generator card. The availability of waveform generator in the console will help in many ways. First, it can generate a variety of shaped pulses for selective decoupling/excitation, and for suppression of multiple solvent peaks. The shaped pulses have added advantages due to their selectivity and less stringent power requirements. For multiple solvent suppression experiments, only the first-channel is used to apply one pulse, which simultaneously has an effect at several positions in the spectrum. Standard spectrometers are equipped with 2 channels. Therefore multiple offset solvent suppression is useful for suppressing more than 2 frequencies and for suppressing two-frequencies while using the second channel for an X nucleus e.g. 13C decoupling. Effective solvent suppression is needed in two-dimensional NOESY experiments using WET-NOESY and WG-NOESY on proteins and oligo-nucleotide adducts. Water suppression by presaturation method leads to drastic reduction in the signal intensities of the resonances of exchangeable protons, viz. imino, amino and amide, due to chemical exchange with water. These experiments are vital for the determination secondary structures of oligo-nucleotide duplexes. The determination of secondary structures of biomolecules is based on extraction of distance constraints from NMR data and restrained molecular dynamics followed by energy minimization. The proposed upgrade of the current NMR spectrometer will enhance and diversify its utility to research groups associated with the RCMI. Budget: Upgrade of the 500 MHz NMR Spectrometer, $184,645."
"9392596","Project Summary Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is the second leading cause of cancer-related death among males in East Africa. In southwestern Uganda, the prevalence of ESCC is increasing while the mean age of diagnosis is decreasing. In addition, ESCC continues to be complicated by late presentation and poor survival rates despite therapy. These changing prevalence and age of onset cannot be explained by known ESCC risk factors including human papillomavirus, alcohol and tobacco use as the prevalence of these risk factors remains low and unchanged. Additional, potentially modifiable risk factors that are contributing to the increase in ESCC have yet to be elucidated. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons exposures in biomass fuel and/or dietary sources are potential explanations of the heightened risk of ESCC in sub-Saharan Africa. The current K43 application seeks to build on previous cross-sectional work that demonstrates male sex, smoking and alcohol as risk factors for ESCC. First, the award will provide the opportunity to strengthen my understanding of measurement and analysis of nutritional data, cancer and genetic epidemiology, and to complete successful apprenticeships with leading experts in cancer genomics, gastroenterology, and nutrition. The proposed training will include brief courses offered through Harvard University and Mbarara University of Science and Technology. Second, my cohort of ESCC patients will enable prospective examination of relationships of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon exposures with ESCC. I will also explore genetic and molecular signatures of ESCC in this population. The proposed career development activities and series of studies will deepen our understanding of the biological mechanisms through which biomass fuel and diet affects ESCC risk, with a primary focus on DNA methylation as a mediator. These findings can provide new understanding of pathways to ESCC that may lead to innovative ways to encourage multifactorial risk factor modification in individuals living in ESCC high burden areas in sub-Saharan Africa, a public health goal that has been difficult to attain.  "
"9418976","ABSTRACT Americans of Hispanic and African heritage are at higher risk to develop molecular subtypes of breast cancer that associate with poor prognosis, including triple-negative (ER-PR-Her2-) and Her2+ breast cancers relative to Non-Hispanic whites. Increased chromosome instability (CI) in most cancers correlates with poor clinical outcomes and higher levels of CI is observed in poor-prognosis HR- breast cancers relative to luminal subtypes. Centrosome amplification, or the accumulation of 3 or more centrosomes within a cell, and defective mitosis are two principal drivers of chromosome instability. Centrosome amplification correlates with invasion, metastasis, poor clinical outcomes, and HR- subtypes. Interestingly, we identified TTK and TBK1 kinases as regulators of centrosome amplification in cancer cells. TTK and TBK1 are centrosome/mitotic regulators, and reports indicate TBK1 can regulate mitotic progression directly, and indirectly through phosphorylation of Plk1, which phosphorylates TTK to modulate the spindle assembly checkpoint. Our preliminary data show that these two mitotic kinases can significantly influence epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT), an activity never described for mitotic kinases. Silencing of TTK reduces phosphorylation of SMAD3 upon TGF- stimulation, suppressing regulators of EMT. In a similar fashion, recent studies from the Chellappan lab identified TBK1 physically interacts with the E2F1 transcription factor, which induces the expression of TTK, and EMT genes like vimentin, fibronectin, ZEB-1, and ZEB2. Further, depletion of TBK1 could significantly reduce the expression of MMP2 and MMP9, suggesting that kinases involved in mitosis like TTK and TBK1 can contribute significantly to the EMT and metastasis of tumors. Chemical inhibition of TTK and TBK1 reduced levels of EMT regulators (Slug, SNAIL), as well as important regulators of the centrosome cycle and mitosis (p-H3, cyclin B, Aurora kinase A). Since inhibitors are available for TTK and TBK1, it would be feasible to target these kinases to combat HR- breast cancers. We hypothesize that elevated levels and activity of TTK and TBK1 enhance tumor growth, epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) and metastasis, and that such events correlate with prognostic molecular subtypes and survival outcomes of H/L breast cancer patients from Puerto Rico. To test this hypothesis, we propose the following Aims: 1. To establish if TTK and TBK1 contribute to poor prognosis molecular subtypes and surrogate markers of survival in Hispanics/Latinos. 2. To determine how TTK and TBK1 drive the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and promote invasion. 3. To determine how TTK and TBK1 impact tumor growth and metastasis. Data resulting from the proposed experiments will allow the identification of pathways influenced by mitotic regulators in breast cancer cells driving invasion and metastasis, and will provide potential prognostic markers for high-risk breast tumors in Hispanics/Latinos."
"9435195","Spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA) is a slowly progressive X-linked neuromuscular disease, for which there is no cure or therapy. Arising in adult males, it is phenotypically characterized by proximal limb and bulbar muscle weakness, fasciculations, and muscle atrophy, caused by dysfunction and degeneration of lower motor neurons and skeletal muscle. The purpose of this project is to generate a more cost-effective, high- throughput, and disease relevant in vivo model system of SBMA, using zebrafish. Support for zebrafish as a disease relevant model of SBMA includes the high structural homology of human and zebrafish neuroanatomy and muscle physiology. Moreover, zebrafish, unlike their small research animal counterparts, flies and worms, express an androgen receptor (AR), and this AR is similar in structure and function to human AR, indicating that the zebrafish, in addition to the fact that it is a vertebrate, would serve as a superior high-throughput model of SBMA. As the disease causing mutation in SBMA is a polyglutamine expansion in the AR protein, we aim to generate a transgenic lines of zebrafish that express polyglutamine-expanded AR, as well as the control, normal glutamine length AR. We postulate that male zebrafish expressing polyglutamine-expanded AR will manifest motor function deficits and histopathology similar to those observed in mouse models and SBMA patients. A zebrafish model of SBMA would provide a powerful, inexpensive, vertebrate model to complement current animal models and expedite therapeutic development for this patient population.  "
"9453518","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT This proposal details the career development plan and research project designed to develop Joseph Cheung, M.D., M.S., into an independent clinician-scientist specializing in the central nervous system hypersomnia disorders. Dr. Cheung's long term goals are to understand the genetic and neurobiological basis of hypersomnia disorders. To achieve these goals, the proposed research and career development plan will further his training in a) mastering actigraphy data analysis, b) understanding and performing genetic (exome sequence) analysis, c) becoming an expert in hypersomnia disorders. These objectives will be accomplished through a combination of didactic coursework, multidisciplinary mentorship, and research activities. His mentoring team will consist of Emmanuel Mignot M.D., Ph.D. (Sleep Genetics), Jamie Zeitzer, Ph.D. (Circadian Biology), Manuel Rivas, Ph.D. (Computational Genetics), and Ruth O'Hara, Ph.D. (Neurocognitive Disorders). This training plan will complement Dr. Cheung's background in neurology and sleep medicine, and will take place at Stanford University, which features extensive educational resources and a superb interdisciplinary environment. This research proposal aims to study idiopathic hypersomnia, a rare and disabling sleep disorder that is poorly understood at this time. Patients with idiopathic hypersomnia suffer from chronic excessive daytime sleepiness, often despite a long sleep time. The first aim of this research involves obtaining clinical and research data from idiopathic hypersomnia patients recruited from the Stanford Technology Analytics and Genomics in Sleep study (STAGES). Objective sleep duration measurements by actigraphy will be used to better characterize idiopathic hypersomnia patients with long sleep and without long sleep time. Various demographic, clinical and actigraphic characteristics between these two subtypes of idiopathic hypersomnia will be compared to yield important clinical insights into this rare sleep disorder. Furthermore, idiopathic hypersomnia patients with objectively verified long sleep time will represent the best possible hypersomnia phenotype for genetic studies. The second aim of this study will involve performing whole-exome sequencing in patients with idiopathic hypersomnia with long sleep, with a goal to identify relevant, associated genetic factors. Results from this research will have significant clinical impact by providing a deeper phenotypic characterization on idiopathic hypersomnia. Identification of genetic factors associated with long sleep hypersomnia will help elucidate the pathophysiology of idiopathic hypersomnia and basic mechanisms of human sleep regulation, leading to translational opportunities in central nervous system hypersomnia disorders. In addition, the proposed training plan will help Dr. Cheung develop into an independent physician- scientist in sleep medicine, specializing in central nervous system hypersomnia disorders and sleep genetics."
"9348419","The objective of this project is to design, fabricate and evaluate a new, muscle-driven ambulatory assist system suitable for clinical testing in the home and community environments that maximizes the functional mobility of individuals with motor complete thoracic level spinal cord injury (SCI). Paralysis from SCI causes rapid degeneration of almost every major organ system. Commercially available externally powered robotic exoskeletons can begin to address such immobility in rehabilitation and supervised settings, but do nothing to counteract the disuse atrophy of the large lower extremity muscles and ensuing cardiovascular deconditioning. The maximal walking speeds and distances achieved with these devices fall far short of those necessary for safe and effective ambulation in the community. As a result, veterans with SCI are still unable to access many physical locations and life opportunities important for unrestricted reintegration into society.  The ?hybrid? approach we propose is radically different from wearable walking robots. Our ?muscle first? strategy derives the primary motive power for walking and other maneuvers by eliciting relatively short bursts of high intensity contractions from the otherwise paralyzed muscles with electrical stimulation. Internalizing the primary power sources means the external components only have to lock/unlock the joints or shape the ballistic limb trajectories generated by the contracting muscles, thus eliminating the need for heavy motors at each joint and enabling users to reap the considerable physiological benefits of exercising their lower extremity muscles. The implanted neuromuscular component of our hybrid system is also continuously available for spontaneous exercise and short duration standing and stepping even without donning the external component.  Stimulated contractions of the hip, knee and ankle muscles routinely generate sufficient power to maintain full weight bearing for several minutes, as well as to accomplish stepping motions for short distances without the need for powered exoskeletons. However, hip flexion can be inconsistent with stimulation alone, especially when attempting to climb steps or walk up ramps. We propose to augment stimulated contractions with a mechanical subsystem consisting of small, lightweight and efficient brace-mounted motors located at the hips. When powered by the contracting muscles, this novel configuration will stabilize the hips during stance, freely rotate during swing, and provide the low-level torques required to consistently achieve the desired limb movements in spite of variations in walking surfaces or stimulated responses. Since the motors only need to provide the incremental torques necessary to augment the stimulated hip muscles and shape the limb trajectories, the entire external structure can be significantly smaller, lighter, and quieter than commercially available powered exoskeletons based on a ?motor-first? strategy. Active knee extension will be generated by exciting the femoral nerve which routinely generates sufficient torque to stand and walk, while a similar mechanism to that proposed for the hip will lock during standing or mid-stance to rest the stimulated muscles, unlock during swing and stair ascent, and assist knee flexion immediately prior to swing. The mechanism will damp the impact of foot-floor contact, and gently lower the body during stair descent or transitioning from standing to sitting. A simple spring-assisted ankle brace will protect the foot and raise the toes during swing, while strong stimulated contractions of the calf muscles provide the propulsive power to drive walking at speeds far beyond those reported for existing exoskeletons.  This project will define a practical clinical intervention to restore long-distance walking at near normal speeds suitable for daily activities and community use. After benchtop and laboratory testing, selected users will attempt to negotiate unrestricted community environments with the hybrid system. The proposed hybrid neuromechanical gait assist system should enable paralyzed veterans to return to healthy, productive and socially engaged lifestyles which will have significant impacts on quality of life and societal participation."
"9287382","Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a long-term complication of diabetes. Around 7 million Americans are suffering from this sight-threatening complication of diabetes. The complex nature of pathogenic mechanisms of DR is the major reason for a lack of promising treatments to treat DR. The Müller cell, a major glia of the retina, plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of DR due to its unique anatomic position spanning the entire retina and the specialized functions such as water and K+ balance, uptake of neurotransmitters, and glycogen storage. Müller cells regulate K+ balance via inwardly rectifying Kir4.1 channels. In DR, the Müller cells are dysfunctional and swollen due to downregulation of Kir4.1 channels and accumulation of water. Circadian rhythms play an important role in governing many biochemical and physiological functions of the body. Circadian rhythm disruption leads to insulin resistance, obesity, and type 2 diabetes (T2D). Previously, using T2D rats, we reported a dysfunctional pattern of rhythm regulatory clock genes in DR. We further tested the importance of clock in DR using a critical clock resetting gene Per2 to show that the Per2m/m mice recapitulate phenotypic features similar to DR. Our exciting preliminary studies demonstrate that (i) Kir4.1 exhibits a diurnal rhythm in the retina and this biorhythm of Kir4.1 is dampened in diabetes; (ii) Kncj10 (the gene for Kir4.1) is under clock gene regulation; and (iii) insulin signaling mediated via insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1) is critical for Kir4.1 expression. However, there is a gap in knowledge with regard to how a disturbed circadian rhythm influences Müller cell function. Therefore, the objective of this study is to understand the role of the circadian regulatory mechanism in controlling Kir4.1 function and to evaluate how circadian rhythm restoration corrects Müller cell dysfunction. We propose the hypothesis that circadian arrhythmia will alter Kir4.1 expression leading to a Müller cell dysfunction. We propose the following specific aims to test our hypothesis. Aim 1: To determine the mechanism by which the dysfunctional clock is involved in Müller cell dysfunction. Aim 2: To assess whether circadian rhythm disruption renders Müller cells resistant to the insulin signal. Aim 3: To test if correction of central clock in db/db mice restores the Müller cell dysfunction. The outcome of this study will ascertain a novel pathogenic mechanism of DR by studying the involvement of disturbed circadian rhythms in Müller cell dysfunction. Modulation of circadian rhythms may represent a novel treatment strategy for the management of DR."
"9394827","Project Summary New tools for large-scale recording of neuronal activity in a living and behaving brain are essential for a better understanding of brain function, efficient analysis and treatment of neuronal disorders. Time resolved volumetric photo-acoustic imaging offers tremendous potential for large-scale brain recording due to its exquisite penetration into living tissues. Most recent developments in instrumentation for photo-acoustic neuroimaging are rapidly advancing the field with ever increasing resolution, sensitivity, field of view and frame rates. Yet, these developments need to be matched by concomitant engineering of suitable contrast agents and activity reporters. The existing genetically encoded calcium indicators have shown promise in proof-of-principle photoacoustic studies but their absorbance maxima in the blue-green ranges of the spectrum is vastly interfered by the strong absorption of hemoglobin in mammalian brains. On the contrary, absorbance of bacterial phytochrome ideally ranges into the near infrared. This project will engineer fluorescent proteins based on bacterial phytochrome into powerful calcium sensors for photo-acoustics. We will insert small calcium binding domains into bacterial phytochromes either by using existing structural information or by using random insertion strategies to turn them into efficient absorbance-based calcium reporters. Prototypical reporters will then be further engineered using diversification and large scale screening of variants using a unique new automated robotic screening station developed by the applicants. Finally, high performing sensor variants will be validated in mouse visual cortex in vivo. Thus, the proposal combines complementary expertise in development of photo-acoustic instrumentation and large scale biosensor engineering to enable fast volumetric activity imaging of the intact scattering mammalian brain."
"9423626","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The proposed research would capitalize on a wealth of longitudinal data previously collected at key developmental stages over a period of 27 years as part of the Harlem Longitudinal Development Study. It has two major aims: The first is to identify the mediators of the relationships between social determinants of health (i.e., socioeconomic disadvantage and ethnicity-based/racial discrimination) and allostatic load in a sample of African Americans and Puerto Ricans entering midlife. The research proposal is guided by a contextual- developmental model based in Phenomenological Variant of Ecological Systems Theory, as well as a pathophysiological theory of stress (allostatic load). Second, the research will identify the differential developmental trajectories of perceived ethnicity-based/racial discrimination from late adolescence to the early forties, examine their associations with allostatic load and mental health in the early forties, and test the ability of resilience resources to mitigate these associations. The sample for this study will consist of 400 male and female African Americans and Puerto Ricans who were previously seen in adolescence (T1, T2), emerging adulthood (T3), young adulthood (T4), and adulthood (T5, T6). Identifying the pathways through which risk and protective factors for allostatic load operate will have important implications for public health by providing targets for intervention and informing policy. Finding moderating constructs that can mitigate the deleterious sequelae of chronic ethnicity-based/racial discrimination will highlight significant areas of resilience. Such a focus on resilience not only moves away from a deficit perspective of people of color, but also has the potential to transform policy and interventions by building on strengths, rather than treating deficits. A move in this direction is an important step towards reaching the goal of eliminating the significant social and ethnic/racial health disparities that plague the U.S. and realizing health equity for all."
"9390382","PROJECT SUMMARY Glaucoma is a leading cause of blindness. Early diagnosis and close monitoring of glaucoma are important because the onset is insidious and the damage is irreversible. Advanced imaging modalities such as optical coherence tomography (OCT) have been used in the past 2 decades to improve the objective evaluation of glaucoma. OCT has higher axial spatial resolution than other posterior eye imaging modalities and can precisely measure neural structures. However, structural imaging alone has limited sensitivity for detecting early glaucoma and only moderate correlation with visual field (VF) loss. Using high-speed OCT systems, we have developed novel OCT angiography technologies to image vascular plexuses that supply the retinal nerve fibers and ganglion cells damaged by glaucoma. Our results showed that OCT angiographic parameters have better correlation with VF parameters. We have also found that measurement of focal and sectoral glaucoma damage using high-definition volumetric OCT angiographic and structural parameters improves diagnostic performance. The goal of the proposed project is to further improve the diagnosis and monitoring of glaucoma using ultrahigh-speed OCT and artificial intelligence machine learning techniques. The specific aims are: 1. Develop quantitative wide-field OCT angiography. We will develop a swept-source OCT prototype that  is 4 times faster than current commercial OCT systems. The higher speed will be used to fully sample the  neural structures and associated capillary plexuses damaged by glaucoma. 2. Simulate VF by combining structural and angiographic OCT. Preliminary results showed that both  structural and angiographic OCT parameters have high correlation with VF on a sector basis. It may be  possible to accurately simulate VF results by combining these parameters using an artificial neural  network. The simulated VF may be more precise and reliable than subjective VF testing. 3. Longitudinal clinical study in glaucoma diagnosis and monitoring. Our novel OCT structural and  angiographic parameters have high accuracy in diagnosing glaucoma. Neural network analysis of structural  and angiographic data from a larger clinical study could further improve diagnostic accuracy. Longitudinal  follow-up will assess if simulated VF could monitor disease progression as well as actual VF. 4. Clinical study to assess the effects of glaucoma treatments. Preliminary results suggest that OCT  angiography could detect the improvement in capillary density after glaucoma surgery and the effects of  drugs. These intriguing effects will be tested in before-and-after comparison studies. If successful, we will have an OCT diagnostic system that in minutes provides objective information on the location and severity of glaucoma damage. This approach could replace time-consuming and unreliable VF testing. Measuring the improvement in retinal circulation could be a quicker way to detect the benefit of glaucoma therapies that work through neuroprotection or regeneration, compared to monitoring VF."
"9357524","Abstract More than a decade after the seminal IOM report, ?To Err is Human?, failure rates in patient safety remain stubbornly high in hospitals. Prior efforts to improve hospital quality have had relatively little impact, in part due to limited access to timely quality improvement data. Our long-term goal is to leverage existing technologies to give voice to hospitalized patients and their family members, leading to improvements in hospital safety and quality. The overall objective in this application is to create and evaluate a tool that gathers patient and family member feedback and makes it rapidly available to providers, enabling nimble and responsive safety and quality improvement efforts. The central hypothesis, based on the theory of co-production, is that observations from patients and families, gathered in a structured way, will provide actionable information regarding patient safety and quality. The rationale for doing this project is to test an innovative new approach to creating a rapidly available data stream to providers who are working on specific improvement efforts, and a mechanism for creating a quality improvement approach that is inherently patient-centered. We plan to test our central hypothesis and thereby accomplish the objective of this application by focusing on the following areas of research for Health IT: Use, Implementation, and Impact on Outcomes, under the study type ?Pilot and feasibility?, pursuing three specific aims: Aim 1. Determine feasibility and acceptability of the patient data collection and provider dashboard tool (Use and Implementation). We will conduct usability testing prior to study start, measure user (patients and providers) engagement over time, and gather feedback about the tool at study end. We hypothesize that patient and caregiver characteristics will predict tool use. Aim 2. Assess whether reporting patient- and caregiver- observed processes of care to providers leads to changes over time (Implementation). We hypothesize that performance on structured items of interest will improve over time with rapidly available data presented to providers. Aim 3. Estimate tool implementation effect sizes, using a pre- post design, on medical errors (Impact on outcomes). The proposed research is innovative, in our opinion, based on a paradigm-shifting conceptual model of patient-engaged quality improvement, and because it leverages technology to gather and present data in an unprecedented manner. The expected contribution of the proposed research will be an adapted tool that will gather meaningful and important data on patient safety and present it in an actionable way to providers and hospital leaders, resulting in a powerful data stream to fuel rapid improvements in patient safety. Pilot data from this proposal will inform the design of a future cluster- randomized trial of the new tool across multiple hospital systems. This contribution will be significant because it represents key steps towards a new approach to improving patient safety in the hospital."
"9403786","ABSTRACT Among the environmental factors that influence biology, light controls an incredibly rich set of processes including circadian rhythms, movement and development. Central to this regulation are diverse families of photoreceptors that harness the photochemically-triggered configurational changes of light-sensitive cofactors, the chemical properties of which confer sensitivity to specific portions of the UV and visible spectrum. These structural alterations are amplified as allosteric changes in the surrounding protein, initiating signal transduction pathways that control biological responses. Understanding how these initial sensing and signaling events are triggered has given insight into fundamental aspects of biology and enabled the development of novel optogenetic tools that are enabling discoveries in diverse fields of biomedicine. Here we focus on examining both signaling mechanism and applicability to tool development for proteins containing LOV (Light-Oxygen- Voltage) photosensory domains. These domains are found in thousands of proteins to date, controlling the activity of over 20 enzymatic and non-enzymatic effector domains in natural systems and many others in engineered proteins. To do so, LOV domains undergo the specific photochemical formation of protein/flavin adducts upon illumination with blue light, using this as a trigger to allosterically drive protein conformational changes around the flavin. This configurational change is allosterically transmitted to the surrounding protein, providing a light-based ?switch? of protein activity that remains engaged until illumination ceases. Fundamental questions regarding these signaling processes remain unanswered, limiting our understanding of natural and engineered LOV proteins. We propose to answer these limitations by pursuing three aims: 1). Determine the lit state structures of two classes of activated LOV proteins to give insight into signaling and guiding future engineering efforts; 2). Establish the correlation of in vitro photochemical and DNA-binding parameters on cellular function of a LOV-controlled transcription factor tools; 3). Examine the generality of LOV signaling models by determining the structural role of photosensing in a novel class of RGS-LOV signaling proteins. To achieve these ends, we will take advantage of an broad foundation of preliminary structural and functional data that will be extended with a mix of biophysical and biochemical studies. Outcomes from this research will include information about fundamental regulatory processes employed by these proteins, giving insights that will be broadly applicable for signal transduction studies."
"9433007","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Deaths from cardiovascular disease (CVD) have begun to increase in the US after decades of decline. Although the reasons underlying this increase in CVD deaths are unclear, the prevention, detection, and optimal treatment of CVD risk factors (i.e., diabetes and hypertension) will be essential for preventing any further increases in CVD mortality. Currently, 14% of adults in the US have diabetes, of which 1 in 3 is undiagnosed, and 29% of adults have hypertension. However, stark disparities exist in the CVD risk factor burden, particularly by social determinants of health. These determinants are key contributors to the development of diabetes and hypertension. Yet, they have largely been omitted from clinical practice and decision-making. There is increasing awareness of the influence of social determinants on health outcomes, but it is not clear exactly which factors should be assessed or how to integrate this information into current practice. Social determinants of health are extensive, so it is important to characterize those that are likely to have the greatest influence on the prevention, treatment and control of diabetes and hypertension and may be used to inform the development of targeted programs and policies. We propose to investigate the community and individual social determinants that contribute to a greater burden of diabetes and hypertension in the southeastern US by leveraging national databases, the Medicare claims administrative database and the infrastructure of a prospective cohort study, the NIH-funded Reasons for Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke (REGARDS) study, that enrolled 30,239 middle-aged and older adults in 2003-07. We will build upon these resources to address the following aims: 1) determine the association of county-level social determinants of health with the county-level prevalence and incidence of diabetes and hypertension, separately, in the southeastern US; 2) evaluate the association of county-level social determinants of health with the county-level prevalence and incidence of diabetes and hypertension, separately, among older adults in the southeastern US using the Medicare database; and 3) evaluate the association of county-level and individual-level social determinants of health with individual-level prevalent and incident diabetes and hypertension, separately, among REGARDS participants in the southeastern US. This proposal will prioritize those social determinants of health that are associated with a greater burden of diabetes and hypertension in the southeastern US and help guide prevention programs and interventions to reduce this excess risk."
"9348613","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal responds to PA-14-004 Advances in Patient Safety through Simulation Research (R18). Suicide is a national public health crisis and a critical patient safety issue. It is the 10th leading cause of death overall and, tragically, the2nd leading cause of death in adolescents and young adults (15-34 years old). Research consistently shows that about half of individuals who die by suicide had contact with primary care providers within one month of their death. Despite these data and the fact that the National Quality Forum designates patient suicide as a never event (i.e., an adverse event that is unambiguous, serious, and usually preventable), there is no required training in suicide prevention for healthcare providers. Patient safety is compromised when primary care providers lack the knowledge and skills to assess and respond to patients at risk for suicide. Given the fact that patients will continue to seek services in primary care, particularly early in the trajecory of symptoms and stressors (i.e., upstream), it is imperative that providers-in-training are educated in identifying and responding to individuals at risk for suicide. This randomized trial brings together three domains to improve patient safety: the latest science about suicide from a public health perspective, effective suicide prevention training that is grounded in adult learning theory using simulation methods, and the context of a changing health care landscape where primary care providers are likely to encounter suicidal individuals. Given the high rate of death by suicide for adolescents and young adults, we will focus on assessing and responding to this population. Participants (pediatric and family medicine residents, nurse practitioner students, n = 108) will be randomized to suicide prevention video-based didactics (control group) or didactics plus two standardized patient interactions with feedback (experimental group) with an adolescent and/or young adult scenario. Both conditions will be assessed for suicide prevention skills during a standardized patient interaction. We hypothesize that both conditions will show improved knowledge as a function of didactic training but that those who had the opportunity to interact with 'at risk, suicidal standardized patients' will show better skills during the assessment, and report greater self-efficacy, intention and actual use of suicide prevention skills with patients. We will also explore, for the experimental group, moderators as well as differences between face-to-face and telehealth patient interviews. If results support the efficacy of the program, training materials, measures, and methods will be disseminated and future studies will expand to other provider and patient populations."
"9552338","Abstract  Oxytocin is a neuropeptide important for social behaviors such as maternal care and parent-infant bonding, however, the exact signaling mechanisms used by oxytocin in the brain are not well understood. The oxytocin receptor is a G protein-coupled receptor that is expressed at two weeks of postnatal life, a time period of heightened plasticity and inhibitory circuit maturation, which is promoted by BDNF. Here we report an interplay between oxytocin and the BDNF TrkB receptor that occurs in the cortex within 15-30 minutes of oxytocin treatment. Receptors for oxytocin and BDNF overlap in their distribution in different brain regions, especially in areas important for learning and memory. Oxytocin's ability to transactivate TrkB receptors is independent of BDNF transcription and release. In the next grant period, we will focus upon the mechanism of TrkB receptor transactivation via oxytocin by studying the cellular mechanisms of action of oxytocin receptors in the rodent brain. We hypothesize that synaptic strength and cortical plasticity may be regulated by the dual actions of oxytocin and TrkB receptor signaling. The long-term effects of oxytocin may be due to crosstalk with the BDNF TrkB receptor. The transactivation of TrkB receptors by oxytocin may affect synaptic changes, and re-balance excitation and inhibition and maintain network stability. Our investigation is directly relevant to understanding the mechanism of trophic factors and their impact upon neurodegenerative diseases, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Parkinson's, Huntington's and Alzheimer's diseases, as well as neuropsychiatric disorders, such as autism, anxiety, depression and schizophrenia."
"9420940","Abstract Very recently, the revolutionary technology of contrast enhanced super-resolution ultrasound imaging has been developed. This novel technique images microvessels at resolutions as small as ten micrometers, over an order of magnitude smaller than the ultrasound diffraction limit, and at depths much greater than traditional limits imposed by the frequency. To achieve advances in all of these seeming paradoxical dimensions super-resolution contrast imaging requires that tens of thousands of frames of data be analyzed, making this technique much more computationally and algorithmically intensive than standard ultrasound imaging. Furthermore the skull presents a unique challenge because it aberrates the wave profile, which reduces the resolution and it generates reverberations that reduce the detectability of contrast agents. Consequently, transcranial super-resolution imaging would be difficult if not impossible to translate to the brain in its current form with current clinical hardware, especially if 3-D imaging is desired (which it is for microvascular morphological analysis). However, there is a solution to this, which our group proposes to achieve in this project. Time reversal, in conjunction with a highly accurate acoustic simulation tool that we have developed, can correct for the aberrations induced by the skull morphology accurately focus ultrasound and improve detectability. New software and implementation approaches designed at UNC, including our innovative adaptive multi-focus beamforming approach, will further increase sensitivity and resolution at clinically relevant depths, and enable full 3-D volume acquisitions at volume frame rates over 5000 FPS, suitable for fast 3-D super-resolution imaging in humans. Recent advances in ultrasound hardware will enable ultra-high frame rate processing. Our academic and clinical teams at UNC Chapel Hill are partnering with Verasonics, Inc, a world leading industrial partner in next-generation ultrasound systems, to develop the first high-frame rate 3-D super resolution imaging system optimized for through-skull imaging. We will do this by first designing and constructing a 256 channel ultra-high frame rate ultrasound system, designed to operate with a custom 16x16 matrix transducer at 1 MHz. Ultra-fast processors, large RAM buffers, GPUs, and high-bandwidth data transfer hardware will be utilized to handle challenging adaptive beamforming tasks and massive data acquisition. Processing will be performed with custom code designed for GPU and cluster computing. Our approach will be validated in phantoms, rodent models of human disease that are placed behind a human skull, and in healthy juvenile pigs. Our motivation is to develop super-resolution imaging as a new approach for imaging blood vessels and blood flow in the brain, with a non-ionizing low-cost imaging technology that could be used bedside. The advancement of the proposed technology will be disruptive for ultrasound imaging ? and could eventually enable real-time functional imaging of the human brain, something previously only possible with much more expensive and lower temporal resolution modalities such as fMRI."
"9385062","E3Gen: Multigenerational effects of toxicant exposures on life course health and neurocognitive outcomes in the ELEMENT birth cohorts SUMMARY The impact of environmental toxicants on health and disease risk during sensitive developmental periods has been recognized for nearly 20 years, as highlighted by the developmental origins of adult disease hypothesis and life course epidemiology. Yet, the potential to understand novel mechanisms implicit in these frameworks has not been fully realized. Few environmental cohorts have followed mother-child dyads beyond adolescence, precluding the ability to understand long-term impacts of toxicant exposures in young adulthood and perimenopause?both dynamic life stages characterized by increased risk of metabolic syndrome and potential changes in neurocognitive processes. The E3Gen project, based on our highly successful, 22-year research collaboration with the Instituto Nacional de Salud Pública de Mexico (INSP), comprises three birth cohorts of women originally recruited from 1994- 2004, their children now aged 12-22 years, and the next generation of grandchildren currently being born. This R24 application leverages the research infrastructure of our ongoing studies in the Early Life Exposure in Mexico to ENvironmental Toxicants (ELEMENT) cohorts and of three NIEHS-funded centers at the University of Michigan, creating an unparalleled opportunity launch new research that maximizes use of the existing biorepository and rich database of repeated toxicant exposures and metabolic and neurocognitive outcomes and that promotes accelerated data and resource sharing with the larger environmental health sciences community. Specific Aims are to: 1) Maintain and enhance the scientific integrity of the E3Gen multigenerational cohort and implement strategies to encourage participation and prevent loss to follow up among 850 mothers aged 38-50 years, their children aged 12-22 years, while also recruiting 90 grandchildren currently and projected to be born over the next five years; 2) Prepare for future scientific studies considering the roles of epigenetics, oral health and oral microbiome in mediating the impact of endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) and metals on metabolic and neurocognitive outcomes across three generations of ELEMENT participants; 3) Develop and test novel data management techniques to improve and enrich data integration and harmonization, data sharing, and cross-project data communication."
"9442154","Project Summary: ! Circadian clocks synchronize organism physiology with diverse environmental and cellular signalis. Deysnchronization of master and peripheral clocks due to disruption in sleep cycles or altered metabolic function has been implicated in the onset and progression of diseases ranging from obesity, diabetes and heart disease. Central to circadian function are two primary factors: 1) A central oscillator that is impacted by complicated feedback loops to maintain circadian rhythms. 2) Sensory proteins that function in signaling nodes within the feedback loops to integrate endogenous and environmental cues. How these sensory elements alter the complex network of feedback loops to modulate circadian function is largely unknown, leading to difficulties in developing therapeutics to target mitigate the deleterious effects of desynchronization of circadian rhythms. Difficulties primarily stem from a lack of information regarding the primary chemistry synchronizing peripheral clocks with the SCN in vertebrate systems. Herein, we leverage the fact that in plants light is the primary factor dictating sensory input to the clock in all cell types, and both plants and mammals employ members of the Period-ARNT-Singleminded (PAS) family to integrate environmental cues through stimuli-dependent reorganization of protein interaction networks. Leveraging A. thaliana as a model system we interrogate how chemical signals are integrated into the circadian clock to regulate metabolism and oxidative stress to promote organism fitness. To achieve these goals we employ a combination of biophysical, computational and in vivo methods. These aims are three fold: 1) Leverage existing crystal structures to Define global conformational responses gating stimuli-dependent protein:protein interaction networks. 2) Employ new computational strategies to identify residues that propagate sensory events throughout the protein structure to selective affect specific structural elements. Therein, we identify of allosteric variants gating light- and oxidative sensing. 3) We validate structural and allosteric variants through in vitro and in vivo assays to delineate how specific allosteric pathways alter the protein-protein interaction landscape to dictate organism physiology. Importantly, residues identified in these three aims are conserved with the Period-ARNT-Singleminded family that are targets for therapeutic intervention in diverse disease states. Thus, allosteric mechanisms identified in this proposal have broad impact to human health and physiology."
"9392713","For individuals with cancer, the end of active treatment and return to life ?as usual? is widely recognized as a difficult transition (IOM 2005): the physical and emotional intensity of active treatment with attendant support and structure are suddenly replaced with expectations that survivors will readily resume life just where they left off. Yet individuals vary greatly in terms of their adjustment during this critical transition point into survivorship, which can set the course of their long-term well-being. Currently, no comprehensive research explaining the underlying mechanisms and outcomes of resilience from this point has been conducted. Resilience trajectories provide a useful way to model individual differences in survivors? post-treatment adjustment. In this application, we respond to PAR-16-326, which requests elucidation of ?mechanisms and processes of resilience.? We will examine adjustment to the challenge that end of primary treatment poses to cancer patients/survivors. Based on the Social Cognitive Restorative Model of Wellbeing (Lent, 2007), we aim to determine the pre-challenge (pre-transition) biological, personal and social factors that predict trajectories of survivors? recovery and resilience in four different life domains (physical and psychological health and well- being, social functioning, and health behaviors), with multiple self-report and objective indices comprising each domain. Our prospective study proposes to follow 575 individuals diagnosed with breast, prostate, or colorectal cancer across the transition to survivorship, assessed during active treatment, within three months of completing treatment, and six, nine, and twelve months post-treatment. Participants will be recruited through the SEER Registry at Yale-New Haven Hospital. Per requirements of PAR 16-326, our project has 2 distinct phases: In the UG3 planning phase, we will establish study infrastructure, pilot-test and finalize our selection of assays, secure IRB approval, develop recruitment procedures, and train staff. For the UH3 phase, we will implement a longitudinal prospective study to test hypotheses derived from our dynamic model of resilience. Our ultimate goal is to identify processes (mechanisms) that mediate the pathways between patients? final stages of primary cancer treatment and quality of their subsequent reintegration into ?life as usual? that hold potential as targets of intervention, based on their influence on resilience trajectories. Our specific aims are to identify the different trajectories of survivors? adjustment through the transition (e.g., resilience, recovery, delayed recovery, chronic difficulties) by domain and the extent to which trajectories are related or distinct across domains, to examine predictors and processes that explain these different trajectories, and to determine if characteristics such as type of cancer or gender moderate their influences. Characterizing these trajectories, their determinants, and their underlying processes are essential for promoting resilience in survivorship and for developing effective and targeted interventions."
"9360881","DESCRIPTION         Investigator Background: Dr. Kukla holds a Ph.D. in clinical psychology from Purdue University (Indianapolis) and is currently a Research Scientist at the VA HSR&D CIEBP. Dr. Kukla has research experience and interest in psychiatric rehabilitation, and particularly, evidence based practices that improve functioning in adults with mental illness. Dr. Kukla's primary area of research interest is enhancing competitive work functioning in veterans with mental illness. Project Background: Veterans with mental illness are more likely to be unemployed than veterans without mental illness and persons in the general population. Consequently, these unemployed veterans often rely on government entitlements and suffer a range of deleterious outcomes. VA supported employment programs, which provide individualized vocational assistance, are partially effective in tackling this unemployment problem. Unfortunately, 40% of persons cannot find work even with this assistance and those who get jobs have difficulty keeping them, as the majority of people experience a job loss within 4 to 8 months. Past studies have linked self-defeating thoughts about one's ability to work and succeed on the job in persons with mental illness working in sheltered work. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) has been demonstrated effective in improving other functional domains when combined with psychiatric rehabilitation approaches; however, no prior research has addressed whether CBT may be effectively adapted and applied to improve competitive employment outcomes in veterans with mental illness. Overall Goal: Dr. Kukla's overall goal for this CDA-2 is to acquire the skills and expertise necessary to become a productive independent VA researcher studying and implementing effective ways of enhancing vocational functioning in the community in veterans with mental illness. Specific Goals & Study Design: The proposed research aims to develop an effective and implementable CBT intervention tailored for competitive work functioning in veterans with mental illness. Training goals involve gaining expertise in qualitativ and mixed methods as well as implementation science. 1. Goal 1: Identify the barriers and facilitators to competitive work functioning in veterans with mental illness. The first project phae consists of online surveys and follow-up in-depth phone interviews of supported employment staff from VA medical centers around the country. This mixed methods approach will provide rich data that will help guide the revision and adaptation of the CBT program. 2. Goal 2: Adapt a cognitive behavioral therapy program aimed at improving competitive employment outcomes in veterans with mental illness. This second project phase consists of a formative evaluation used to tailor a CBT program to improve competitive work outcomes. First, the existing CBT intervention will be revised based on the results of staff interviews in Phase 1 and existing empirical literature. Next, two groups of veterans with mental illness will participate in and provide feedback on the 8-week group CBT intervention; the CBT intervention and treatment protocol will be revised after each wave of participants goes through the intervention. 3. Goal 3: Conduct a longitudinal pilot study using the newly adapted CBT program. To test the revised intervention and determine effect sizes in preparation for a large multi-site trial of the intervention, we will compare 25 participants who receive the CBT intervention and are engaged in supported employment services to a control group comprised of 25 participants engaged in supported employment services only. Primary outcomes will include competitive work outcomes (e.g., duration of employment); secondary outcomes will include psychosocial outcomes (e.g., quality of life, symptoms, psychiatric hospitalizations, work-related self-efficacy, work productivity, work effectiveness, veteran satisfaction)."

Environmental health specialists from the MDH Division of Environmental Health and epidemiologists from the MDH Foodborne, Waterborne, Vector borne, and Zoonotic Diseases Section will continue to comprise the MDH EHS- Net team and will work closely together to conduct EHS-Net activities. Active population-based surveillance for reportable bacterial and protozoal pathogens will be conducted, along with state-of the art outbreak detection and investigation. Environmental assessments will be conducted on all foodborne outbreaks in commercial food establishments in Minnesota using standard tools to allow collection of high quality data for the National Voluntary Environmental Assessment Information System [NVEAIS]. Special studies to identify practices, behaviors, or other risk factors that lead to sporadic foodborne illness will be conducted at random samples of restaurants in previously selected sampling frameworks. Another proposed project is to synthesize all previous EHS-Network and disseminate it to target audiences in an effective format. Finally, a major part of our proposed ongoing work will be to use data and lessons learned from past EHS-Net activities to develop, implement, and evaluate interventions at commercial food establishments. MDH will continue to build communication and collaborations with EHS-Net partners (other states, CDC, FDA, and EPA) and will actively participate in multi-site studies decided on by the EHS-Net Steering Committee. Education of environmental health specialists and industry groups throughout Minnesota, based on lessons learned from EHS-Net, will continue to be actively pursued."

"9218257","Project Summary Inflammation is generally considered a beneficial host response towards invading pathogens or tissue injury. Prolonged inflammation, however, can be destructive and maladaptive, leading to irreversible damage to delicate tissues. Thus, the ideal treatment approach when dealing with inflammation-sensitive tissues, such as the retina, should include immunomodulatory therapies to promote the rapid resolution of inflammation and the restoration of tissue homeostasis to minimize secondary host-mediated damage. Recently, pro-resolution- based strategies using specialized pro-resolving mediators (SPMs) have shown great potential for the treatment of multiple inflammatory diseases. We show that the intravitreal administration of resolvin D1 (RvD1), a type of SPM, in bacterial (S. aureus)-infected mouse eyes attenuated the development of endophthalmitis, with drastically reduced inflammation and tissue damage and preserved retinal function, underline the importance of RvD1-mediated pro-resolving signaling in endophthalmitis. However, unexpectedly, we discovered that RvD1 treatment failed to protect the eyes of Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) knockout mice from staphylococcal endophthalmitis. Moreover, we observed a direct interaction of TLR2 with the RvD1 receptor, lipoxin A4/formyl peptide receptor 2 (ALX/FPR2, referred as FPR2). This raises an interesting fundamental question, whether the molecule or signaling pathways that induce the resolution of inflammation interact with other pathways such as the TLRs, which promote the induction of inflammation. Thus, based on prior studies and our preliminary data, we hypothesize that RvD1-mediated protective innate responses in bacterial endophthalmitis are dependent on TLR2 signaling. This will be tested with three specific aims. Aim-1 will decipher the mechanisms underlying RvD1-induced protective innate responses in bacterial endophthalmitis. This will be accomplished by using pharmacological inhibitors of RvD1-mediated FPR2 signaling, as well as the use of FPR2 overexpressing transgenic (Tg) mice and FPR2 KO mice. Bone marrow chimeric studies will be performed to determine the relative contribution of FPR2 on residential vs. myeloid cells. Aim-2 will investigate the interplay of the RvD1 and TLR2 signaling pathways in promoting inflammation resolution in endophthalmitis. These studies will elucidate this novel cross-talk by determining 1) whether TLR2 deficiency alters the generation of RvD1, 2) under which conditions TLR2 and FPR2 interact physically, and 3) the consequences of this interaction on downstream signaling. Aim-3 is designed to test the efficacy of RvD1 as an adjunct therapeutic in mitigating endophthalmitis-associated vision loss. Proposed experiments include the co- administration of RvD1 with conventional antibiotics and the determination of the optimal route of delivery (topical vs. intravitreal) and a comparison of its efficacy with that of corticosteroids. Together, we believe that the mechanistic insights and the treatment strategies developed in this proposal could have a major impact on the field, not only with regards to endophthalmitis but other ocular and non-ocular infectious diseases as well."
"9379805","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     BACKGROUND: Posttraumatic Stress Disorder constitutes a substantial proportion of the burden of illness among veterans. However, current PTSD treatments are not effective for all, and a significant number remain symptomatic despite pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy. As a result, there has been increased interest within the military and VA in Complementary and Alternative Medicine approaches, such as yoga, to improve symptoms without requiring direct verbal processing of the trauma. Yoga provides an innovative approach to calming hyperarousal, reducing numbness/avoidance, and improving self-regulation of emotions, while cultivating physical and emotional well-being. Because of this unique approach to the biological, psychological, and social dimensions of PTSD, we believe that yoga interventions are poised to meet the demand for more effective PTSD treatment options for veterans. Recent research indicates that yoga interventions can be delivered successfully to individuals who have PTSD and have potential to reduce clinician rated and self-reported overall PTSD symptoms, depression and anxiety. However, few studies exist that have evaluated yoga for PTSD and they have involved small sample sizes and are either uncontrolled or waitlist/usual care controlled. Also, there is much variation among studies in the style and components of yoga interventions. Thus, a randomized controlled trial of a standardized, traditional, holistic yoga intervention is urgently needed to inform VA policy makers and clinicians of the potential benefits of yoga as an adjunct to currently available PTSD treatments. OBJECTIVE: The overall goal of this project is to compare the effects of a 16-week Holistic Yoga Program (HYP) with a 16-week Wellness Lifestyle Program (WLP) on PTSD and related symptoms and outcomes. This project has three specific aims: 1) to compare the effects of the interventions (HYP vs. WLP) on overall PTSD symptom severity; 2) compare the interventions' effects on PTSD-specific symptoms (anger, sleep), PTSD-related symptoms (depression, anxiety, pain) and related outcomes (well-being/quality of life); 3) to manualize the Holistic Yoga Program and training process for experienced yoga teachers to deliver HYP to individuals who have PTSD in order to facilitate future study and dissemination efforts. METHODS: Our study sample will include 232 outpatients with a clinician-confirmed diagnosis of PTSD, recruited from the Roudebush VA Medical Center as well as metropolitan area mental health clinics/clinicians and military/veterans' organizations, who will be randomly assigned to receive the Holistic Yoga Program (HYP) or the Wellness Lifestyle Program (WLP). The HYP will involve a standardized 16-week intervention consisting of: 1) in-person group yoga class taught by a yoga instructor registered through the Yoga Alliance at least at the 200 hour level; 2) classes will include yoga postures, breathing practices, deep muscle contraction practices, relaxation practices, and teacher-led discussions to exchange lessons learned, and introduce relevant aspects of yoga philosophy; 3) guided yoga postures, breath and relaxation practice audio recordings for home-use; and 4) a Participant Handbook to reinforce concepts taught during in-person sessions. The WLP is an attention control comprised of low intensity physical activity and didactics about wellness topics that will also encourage home practice and provide a Participant Handbook to reinforce concepts taught during in- person sessions."
"9449797","ABSTRACT We will use our expertise in somatosensory organization and plasticity to develop novel and automated solutions for cell identification based upon neural activity, in order to decode the algorithms neural circuits use for information processing. Extracellular recordings in sensory cortex have been thought to primarily represent excitatory neuron activity, since these cells comprise ~80% of the total cell population. However, targeted cell recordings in S1 reveal that firing activity is dominated by inhibitory neurons, and that excitatory neurons can show 10-100 fold lower firing rates depending on cortical layer. Furthermore, new findings that reveal the complex relationship between different subtypes of inhibitory neurons make it difficult to relate blindly-recorded firing activity to local- or network-level computations. Clearly, cell-types matter, and massively parallel extracellular recordings that do not enable the simultaneous identification of multiple cell types will be limited in identifying principles for information transmission and encoding. Based on our preliminary findings, we hypothesize that the complex spontaneous and evoked spike trains from molecularly-identified neurons will provide unique and cell-type specific signatures that will enable cell identification from in vivo extracellular recordings. In collaboration with computer scientists at Carnegie Mellon, we will develop machine-learning algorithms for cell classification, using data collected from in vitro and in vivo recordings."

"9375729","SUMMARY Surgical site infections account for approximately 20% of the 1.7 million healthcare acquired infections annually. Reprocessing of surgical equipment is essential for avoiding HAIs, yet 1 in 3 hospitals have reprocessing deficiencies and high-profile failures continue. Sterile processing departments (SPDs) are central to surgical performance, and achieving reliable sterile processing is important for the AHRQ Patient Safety Portfolio, yet there is paucity in improvement or systems research in this area. Tasks, technologies, people, internal environments, organization and external environments all need to be harmonized to optimize the system of work. We propose to use Work Systems Analysis (WSA) - an analytical process which models whole systems of work ? combined with the Systems Engineering Initiative for Patient Safety (SEIPS) framework to initiate a major program of research and improvement in sterile processing. Few research projects have ever explored sterile processing as a work system; this project further develops the use of WSA for improvement in healthcare; and will be delivered by a team staff, administrators and embedded human factors specialists. Preliminary studies have revealed a range of socio-technical systems challenges related to safety and quality such as sharps injury risks, complex equipment hides soiling, and dried blood preventing disassembly. The first aim will be to conduct a work systems analysis of two sterile processing departments in one hospital system. Basic process mapping and task analysis will be conducted using interviews, direct observations, photos and videos, instrument tracking data, administrative data, meeting minutes, standard operating procedures, and regulatory documentation. The SEIPS framework will provide a structure in which to organize components of the process into an abstraction hierarchy, which will provide a multi-level model of the interactions between components. A variance matrix will then be produced detailing sources of variation and potential controls for each component. The second aim will be to conduct an exploratory statistical analysis using a variety of administrative and electronic data sources to reveal significant relationships between external outcome measures (bioburden, broken instruments, SSIs), external variances (surgical specialty, operative type, caseload), internal outcome measures (re-work rates, processing times), and internal variances (workforce level, condition of returning trays). A working group will help define hypotheses to test and assure data quality, while the identification of index operations to study will help to control for confounds. The final exploratory aim will be to observe and record changes in the two SPD units over the year duration of the project, and to uncover potential interventions for future interventional studies."
"9333957","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Ovarian cancer is the 5th leading causes of cancer death among women in the United States. This disease is often detected at late stages after peritoneal metastasis, at which point prognosis is poor. Standard therapy includes combination platinum and taxane chemotherapy following the surgical resection of tumors. Unfortunately, ovarian tumors frequently present with or develop resistance to current chemotherapeutic regimens, and this drug resistance represents a major hurdle in the treatment of disease. The goal of this proposed research is to better understand how to target ovarian cancer and potentially impact clinical outcomes. The role of the Notch signaling pathway in the development of chemo-resistance in ovarian cancer will be explored. Notch signaling is characterized by juxtacrine interactions between Notch receptors and ligands on adjacent cells, and is known to play a role in many aspects of tumorigenesis. The Notch3 receptor is upregulated in ovarian cancer and is correlated with both worse prognosis and chemotherapy resistance. The effect of Notch3 activation in vitro will be assessed with a cytotoxicity assay to determine the dose response to cisplatinum therapy. A mouse model of ovarian cancer will also be used to determine if Notch3 activation in metastatic ovarian cancer will increase platinum resistance. In addition, studies will be performed to determine if the use of a novel Notch3 inhibitor is capable of reducing chemotherapy resistance in a metastatic ovarian cancer model. This will be the first study defining intraperitoneal metastatic ovarian growth with use of combination platinum and Notch inhibitor therapy using non-toxic Notch3-specific inhibition. In addition to its role in endogenous tumor signaling, Notch plays an important role in the establishment of tumor vasculature. Angiogenesis, the development of new blood vessel from pre-existing vessels, is important in the development of ovarian cancer. Angiogenesis contributes to tumor cell survival and ascites accumulation. Notch1 signaling is required to produce functional tumor vasculature, and its inhibition is known to disrupt vasculature function. The effect endothelial-specific knock out of Notch1 on tumor vasculature will be assessed in a metastatic mouse model of ovarian cancer. These experiments will elucidate the effect of Notch1 signaling in the vasculature on the growth and development of ovarian cancer. Furthermore, the effect of a novel, proprietary Notch1 inhibitor on the development of ovarian cancer and the resultant tumor vasculature will be examined. These studies will generate insights into the utility of Notch inhibition in the treatment for aggressive ovarian cancers."
"9471050","Heart Disease is the leading cause of death in the US, with approximately 735,000 myocardial infarction (MI) events per year. Stroke is the fifth leading cause of death in the US and the number one cause of long-­term adult disability with nearly 800,000 stroke events in the US each year. The reduction of risk factors for stroke and heart disease has become a high priority, with policy efforts implementing risk reduction efforts. Novel risk factors such as inflammation and infection, including influenza like illness (ILI), or environmental exposures, such as air pollution, are known to be risk factors for MI and stroke. Moreover, ambient air pollution increases the risk of ILI, suggesting the potential for air pollution triggering an ILI event, which then subsequently triggers a stroke or MI event. Racial disparities are highly prevalent in not only the levels of air pollution, but also in the health effects of air pollution, as well as having a major role in the risk of ILI, stroke and MI. Racial and ethnic minorities are at higher risk to be exposed to high levels of air pollution, and are t higher risk for infections, stroke and MI. While the relationships between air pollution/cardiovascular disease and air pollution/ILI have been independently recognized, the combined relationship between air pollution, ILI and subsequent cardiovascular events, and how racial disparities influence this relationship has not yet been investigated. To overcome the current barriers to knowledge, this application aims to (1) determine the effect racial disparities has on the relationship ILI has on the association between air pollution and MI (2) determine the effect racial disparities has on the relationship ILI has on the association between air pollution and stroke, and (3) identify the populations at greatest risk for having an MI or stroke due to the combined effects of air pollution and ILI. Furthermore, no study has addressed these relationships in a large scale, generalizable dataset that allows for exploration of geographical, urban/rural, or differences across biologically relevant variables, such as sex and age, that could further influence these relationships. We will use two separate, large-­scale administrative datasets to assess these relationships. The analyses will be conducted in the MarketScan dataset first, and then replicated in the SPARCS dataset. MarketScan is an administrative dataset with nearly 230 million de-­identified patients with longitudinal information on patient demographics, including residential metropolitan statistical area (MSA) and 3-­digit zipcode, and ICD-­9 codes (pre-­2015) or ICD-­10 codes (post-­2015) diagnosis and procedure codes for all inpatient and outpatient visits linked by a de-­identified patient identifier code. The analyses will then be replicated in the New York Department of Health Statewide Planning and Research Cooperative System (SPARCS) dataset, a comprehensive data reporting system that collects information on hospital admissions and emergency department (ED) visits within the state of New York with detailed information on patient characteristics, demographics and diagnoses. The innovation of this idea is identifying at risk groups as defined by air pollution status and ILI as opposed to traditional risk factors."
"9354439","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Despite over a decade of safety work in healthcare, injury and death due to preventable events remain the third leading cause of death in the U.S. [1]  Wide variation in mortality rates across hospitals suggest substantial opportunities for improvement.  Several decades of patient safety work have been focused on preventing complications in an effort to ultimately reduce mortality.  However, these efforts have not had a significant impact and there is growing recognition that high mortality and low mortality hospitals  are distinguished less by their complication rates than by how successfully they recognize and manage complications once they occur during the early period of clinical deterioration.  Thus, minimizing failure to rescue (i.e., death following a major complication) FTR) is critical to reducing mortality in hospitalized patients.          Successful rescue hinges on early recognition and timely management of serious complications once they occur, which requires understanding all of the factors involved and which are most important.  We propose to establish a FTR Patient Safety Learning Lab that is focused on creating the ideal hospital rescue system.  The focus will be on early upstream recognition and management of non-preventable complications.  Studies will target gaps in understanding the technology factors behind ideal risk assessment/surveillance supporting early detection of complications and the human factor that support the ideal individual and team response in effectively managing these complications.  A novel translation approach will be used to rapidly support reliable early rescue.  Ultimately, the ideal Integrated Rescue System will have tremendous potential to reduce both the mortality and harm currently associated with FTR."
"9473489","Abstract  Innate immunity is an ancient defense response that evolved with the earliest metazoan creatures, and is the first line of defense against microbial infection. These responses rely on the immediate recognition of microbes by germline-encoded receptors, and drive the production of numerous chemical, biological, and cellular responses to defend against infection. In the face of constant microbial assault, innate immunity is essential for the survival of nearly all multicellular organisms. On the other hand, over-exuberant or inappropriate innate immune responses are the underlying cause of morbidity and mortality associated with many infectious, autoimmune, and autoinflammatory diseases. Thus, a thorough mechanistic understanding of innate immunity has many potential applications in the development of the next generation of therapeutics. This proposal uses the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster as a model for the study of innate immunity. Flies offer many advantages for the study of innate immunity, including experimental tractability and a model system without the complexity of the adaptive immune response. The Drosophila immune response is an excellent model for vector insect species, and discoveries made in flies are being translated into new approaches to control vector-borne diseases. Furthermore, many aspects of the innate immune responses are highly conserved with mammals, and discoveries made in flies have been translated into important, paradigm shifting, findings in mammals. Particularly relevant for this proposal are the conserved NF-?B signaling pathways that drive the immediate response to infection, in both insects and mammals.  In Drosophila, systemic microbial infections are recognized by two distinct NF-?B signaling pathways, the Toll and immune deficiency (Imd) pathways. Both of these pathways are triggered by microbial cell walls and drive the production of antimicrobial peptides and other immuno-protective molecules. In particular, the Imd pathway is triggered by DAP-type peptidoglycan from the cell wall of certain bacteria. The long-term objective of this proposal is to understand in molecular detail the mechanisms used by the Imd pathway to trigger effective immune responses. The specific aims of this proposal address the molecular mechanisms involved in peptidoglycan recognition and Imd signal transduction. Aim1 probes the function and regulation of amyloid fibrils formed by both the peptidoglycan receptors and key adapter proteins in this pathway. Aim 2 is focused on the ubiquitin dynamics that temporally regulate the Imd pathway, involving both activating K63- chains and response-limiting K48-polyubiquitination. Aim 3 involves the characterization of a new family of transporters involved in delivering peptidoglycan fragments, e.g. muramyl-dipeptide and tracheal cytotoxin, to cytosolic innate immune receptors, in flies and mammals."
"9431653","Project Summary  Type 2 diabetes is the sixth leading cause of death in the U.S., largely as a result of cardiometabolic complications such as coronary heart disease (CHD). T2D ranges in prevalence from under 4% to almost 18% in counties across the country. The geographic variation can be explained in part by several place-level contextual factors, but the proportion of variance explained by county-level indicators differs regionally. For example, while a combination of nine county-level measures of mainly socioeconomic, race/ethnicity, and built environmental features explain up to 94% of the variation in T2D prevalence in the Midwest, these same factors explain very little variation in Mid-Atlantic counties, including those in Pennsylvania (PA). Our study focuses on four contextual domains that we hypothesize impact T2D and CHD outcomes in PA: chronic environmental contamination, social environment, food environment, and physical activity environment (both utilitarian [walkability] and recreational physical activity). We will evaluate multiple mechanisms through which these factors could impact T2D and CHD. Potential pathways include the influence of physical and social environmental contextual factors on stress, sleep quality, mental health, health care system effectiveness, and obesity-related behaviors. Multilevel studies using nested geographies at several scales are necessary to disentangle the role of contextual and individual factors associated with T2D and its consequences. Thus, we will conduct two nested multilevel studies of T2D and CHD onset and control of T2D. The setting for each is the large, diverse region of PA served by the Geisinger Health System, allowing us to link contextual factors to the wealth of individual-level data contained in electronic health records (EHR). Each will evaluate contextual main effects and then mediation and moderation of these effects. The two connected studies represent an efficient, big data approach to research while simultaneously offering a deep contextual examination of T2D and CHD. The first (38-county EHR study [38co-EHR]) will use existing data on 30,000 patients with T2D and 200,000 patients without T2D. This longitudinal study will be conducted in 38 counties comparing associations in counties and smaller, nested geographies (multi-scale) in relation to T2D onset and control and CHD onset. The second (4-county Behavior and Biomarker Study [4co-BBS]) will study T2D control in four of these counties with high and low T2D burden, evaluating cross-sectional associations in smaller geographies. 4co- BBS will supplement EHR measures and secondary contextual data with primary data collection using saliva cortisol, direct observation of communities, and patient questionnaires. The 4co-BBS study will broaden the scope of pathways examined, collecting data on health behaviors, health system distrust, and community perceptions. Identifying the contextual factors with the greatest influence on the prevalence of T2D and T2D cardiometabolic complications in PA is critical to understanding regional differences and will inform the development of targeted primary and secondary prevention strategies."

"9364844","Project Summary  Dry eye disease (DE) is a multifactorial condition defined by signs of tear film instability and symptoms of ocular irritation and blurred vision. Symptom relief is the primary reason DE patients seek medical attention. However, topical eye treatments that reduce the signs of ocular inflammation often fail to manage symptoms in moderate to severe cases and peripheral signs of DE do not reliably predict disease severity. These findings suggest a critical role for CNS mechanisms in the development and maintenance of ocular pain in severe cases of DE; however, little is known about central neural processing of ocular signals that are relevant for symptomatic DE. Converging lines of evidence from electrophysiological, molecular and anatomical approaches are applied in a rodent model for tear deficiency, exorbital gland removal. The overall goals of this project are to determine mechanisms for increased neural excitability of trigeminal brainstem neurons after persistent tear reduction and if neuron- glia interactions contribute to altered neural processing and enhanced protective eye muscle reflexes. Aim 1 develops a quantitative sensory testing (QST) protocol to characterize the encoding properties of ocular trigeminal brainstem neurons in male and female rats. A novel recording and analysis method is developed to assess squint-like activity in upper and lower portions of the orbicularis oculi muscle as a measure of nociceptive behavior in anesthestized rats. Aim 2 determines if a ?feed forward? pathway connecting caudal with rostral trigeminal regions contributes to ocular hyperalgesia in DE. Aim 3 determines: a) if sensory signals that drive microglia activation do so by upregulating Toll-like and purinergic P2x receptors, b) the distribution and localization neuroactive products by microglia (IL-1?, BDNF) and their receptors on neurons and glia, and c) blockade of neuron-glia interactions alter the properties of ocular-responsive neurons and evoked eyelid muscle responses in sham and DE male and female rats. By combining neural recording and eye muscle activity with approaches that interfere with microglia activation (purinergic receptors), inflammasome formation (NLRP3) and products of microglia (IL-1?), this project will provide novel information on central mechanisms of ocular hypersensitivity in an animal model for tear deficiency. The long-term goals of this project are to develop new approaches to assess symptoms in moderate to severe cases of DE and to determine if targeting receptors for neuron- microglia interactions has therapeutic potential to manage ocular hyperalgesia in DE."
"9355161","Project Summary Epilepsy is one of the leading neurological disorders in the United States, affecting more than 479,000 children and over 2 million adults. Approximately 30% of epileptic patients have poor seizure control despite antiepileptic medications and are potential candidates for neurosurgical intervention. Early identification and referral of children who are potential surgical candidates is complex and while relevant guidelines exist, there is no standard process to efficiently identify those patients meeting criteria for neurosurgical intervention. Given the large corpus of note-based data available in the electronic health record (EHR), it is challenging for providers to efficiently retain and process all the pertinent patient information. Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques have been successfully used to evaluate clinical notes and make recommendations in the research setting. However, NLP techniques are rarely integrated into practice to provide real-time clinical decision support. We developed and retrospectively evaluated a NLP system to help identify those patients who meet neurosurgical criteria and therefore enable surgical consults and evaluations to occur sooner. Knowing clinical decision support can improve outcomes of care, our proposed research will implement NLP into clinical practice and develop a decision support mechanism to improve the time to surgery for eligible patients. The objective of this project is to implement NLP directly into clinical care and determine the most effective decision support mechanism for provider adherence to epilepsy surgical consult recommendations. The long- term goal of this project is to reduce the time to initial surgery evaluation for patients with intractable epilepsy by integrating NLP-classification criteria into clinical practice. This project is one of the first in the field to study the integration of NLP recommendations into clinical care. We will use a human factors engineering framework to design and to analyze two different alerting methodologies for the best-fit for clinical workflow to produce the optimum provider adherence while reducing alert fatigue. Epilepsy progress notes can be classified across hospitals, and if successful, the system will be implemented in additional pediatric institutions around the United States."
"9446062","Abstract The goal of the PDX Core is to provide high-quality, clinically relevant, and molecularly annotated PDX models for the research projects described in the University of Texas PDX Development and Trial Center (UTPDTC) grant application by leveraging PDX resources at our institutions and developing new PDX models using rigorous quality standards so that the models can be used to guide clinical trial development. Because of U54 funding limitations and to keep things as simple as possible, this U54 PDX Core will only function at the MD Anderson Cancer Center which has more than enough surgical specimens coming in to fulfill the needs of this grant. The existing UTSW PDX lung cancer models (~40) developed through the NCI SPORE in Lung Cancer (P50CA70907) will be used by UTSW in Project 1, and new and existing UTMDACC PDX models created by the PDX Core at MDACC will be supplied to the various projects including for the UTSW component of Project 1. The PDX models developed and/or characterized under this UTPDTC grant will be available to other cancer researchers through the NCI Patient-Derived Models Repository and PDX Development and Trial Centers Research Network (PDXNet). We are in a unique position to provide high-quality PDX models for studies described in this grant application and for the cancer research community. Our research team has established 506 PDX models from human lung, breast, colorectal, and pancreatic cancers and completed whole exome sequencing and RNA sequencing for 176 and 94 of these models respectively. We are currently participating in the NCI's collaborative initiative on PDX models through two separate NCI supplemental awards. We will use the rigorous quality standards developed by the NCI to generate and characterize PDX models and provide high- quality PDX models for preclinical investigations. Furthermore, we will enhance the diversity of PDX models for answering clinical and/or translational questions by leveraging the world-class translational expertise and access to human tissues unique to our institutions for generating new PDX models. For example, more than 20,000 surgical procedures and 50,000 diagnostic and/or treatment procedures are performed annually at UTMDACC. Our patient consent forms have already been reviewed by NCI staff and are appropriate for sharing PDXs with the cancer research community through NCI's Patient-Derived Models Repository and PDXNet. To achieve our goal of supporting the UTPDTC projects and PDXNet activities, we will provide high-quality clinically and molecularly annotated PDXs after rigorous quality testing of established PDX models and enhance the diversity of PDX models by generating and characterizing new models. The proposed study has significant public health implications because providing the highest quality PDX models for the preclinical investigations described in this application and to the cancer research community will ultimately improve and accelerate the development of new effective biomarker-driven cancer therapies, helping cancer patients fight their disease.  "
"9564577","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Lysosomes (vacuoles in yeast) are acidic organelles that are well known for their role in degradation of cellular material through pathways such as autophagy. In addition to their role in degradation, it is also becoming clear that the lysosome is a central hub for cellular metabolism. Nutrients such as amino acids and ions are stored in the lysosome or vacuole at high levels, and nutrient-sensing pathways important for lifespan regulation such as the Target of Rapamycin (TOR) Pathway sense nutrients at the lysosomal surface. Impaired lysosomal function has been linked to the aging process and development of age-associated diseases for quite some time. However, how lysosomal dysfunction contributes to organismal aging is still unclear. Using the yeast replicative aging model system, we recently shed light on this topic by discovering a new metabolic connection between the lysosome/vacuole and mitochondria that is central to the aging process. Lysosomal function requires acidification by the evolutionarily conserved Vacuolar H+-ATPase. We found that lysosomal acidity declines at an early replicative age (defined by number of divisions) in yeast, and this change in lysosomal acidity leads to mitochondrial dysfunction and lifespan limitation. Direct suppression of lysosomal acidification loss through overexpression of V-ATPase subunits is sufficient to prevent mitochondrial dysfunction and extend lifespan, suggesting that lysosomal acidity is a critical regulator of lifespan and mitochondrial function. Consistent with this idea, we also found that lysosomal acidity is regulated by glucose levels. Calorie restriction (CR) enhances lysosomal acidity, and this enhancement is required for CR-induced lifespan extension. Collectively, these studies establish budding yeast as an excellent model to understand the role of the lysosome in aging, and support our central hypothesis that lysosomal acidity is a critical determinant of lifespan through its metabolic connection to mitochondrial function. Our previous work also raises two important unanswered questions that we will address in this proposal: how are lysosomes and mitochondria functionally connected (Aim 1), and how does CR regulate acidification of the lysosome/vacuole to promote lifespan extension (Aim 2). The experiments outlined in this proposal will define the functions of the lysosome that are important for its role in aging and disease, and identify new avenues for lifespan extension that function through enhancement of lysosomal acidity. The activity of the lysosome is highly conserved across species, including its metabolic link to the mitochondria. Thus, our long-term plan is to translate our results from the yeast experiments proposed here to determine the effects of lysosome modulation on aging and disease in mammalian systems."
"9446059","SUMMARY Our overarching goal for the University Texas PDX Development and Trial Center (UTPDTC) is to optimize personalized biomarker-based cancer therapy and identify effective targeted drugs based on the molecular characteristics of each tumor. Our short-term goals are to establish a biobank of clinically, and molecularly- annotated PDXs and to use PDXs as a platform for preclinical drug development and biomarker discovery. The primary goal for UTPDTC investigators will be to develop PDX trial strategies for preclinical testing of single agents and drug combinations. These models will allow the determination of the optimal treatments (single drugs or combinations) that should be tested in clinical trials in increasingly individualized, molecularly defined subsets of tumors. In this application we propose projects to prioritize the clinical testing of many targeted agents focused on non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), colorectal cancer (CRC), pancreatic cancer (PDAC), and triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) tumor subtypes, as well as patients with selected genomic alterations across other histologies. Over the past 9 years, both University of Texas MD Anderson (UTMDACC) and The University of University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center (UTSW) have established institution-wide efforts to generate novel PDX models and perform preclinical testing. Cumulatively the two institutions have hundreds of PDX models of different tumor types, including clinically-annotated models in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC, n=190 with 150 at UTMDACC and 40 at UTSW), colorectal cancer (CRC, n=127 models) pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PDAC, n=145 models), and triple negative breast cancer (TNBC, n=44 models); four diseases where there is an urgent need for novel therapeutics. We have characterized many tumor subtypes in our existing PDXs and plan to characterize many more with the ultimate goal of developing drug combinations in defined tumor subsets in a context that can lead to clinical trials which will validate the experimental results. We plan to focus on NCI-IND agents that are primarily used by the Experimental Therapeutics Clinical Trials Network. The availability of hundreds of PDXs of diverse histologic types and molecular profiles provides a unique opportunity for synergistic interactions among the UTPDTC investigators, PDXNet, and ETCTN. Each Project will identify molecular subtypes and then test with drugs targeted to putative pathways. Similar molecular subtype profiles will be identified across projects and histologic classifications. This provides an opportunity to test the activity of drugs targeting specific molecular pathways that may be active in several histologically distinct subtypes. Such pan-histologic activity could greatly accelerate drug development. Our proposed studies focus on targeted therapeutic agents for treatment of diseases and/or molecular subtypes that have unmet medical needs. The proposed studies are highly relevant to public health, as their success will lead to effective precision therapy for cancers, for which current therapies are ineffective."
"9358506","7PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The World Health Organization (WHO) Trachoma Program aims to eliminate trachoma as a public health concern by 2020?strictly speaking, this would be a control program, as infection is not being eliminated. The WHO recommends three to five annual mass azithromycin distributions to districts with measured prevalence of follicular trachoma (TF) above 10%, before re-assessment. However, despite as much as a decade of annual mass azithromycin distribution, TF prevalence in some districts of Amhara, Ethiopia remains over 25%. Elimination of infection, defined as reduction to zero in the incidence of infection in a specific defined geographic area, is feasible and may actually be more sustainable than control, as it may be less likely for infection to return in a community that has achieved zero new infections. Here, we propose to test two alternative antibiotic-based strategies for intensive targeting of core groups to achieve elimination at the kebele (administrative unit consisting of ~15 villages, or development teams) level. We propose a three-arm cluster randomized trial to test whether quarterly treatment of (1) all children aged 0-9 in the kebele plus annual mass azithromycin distribution or (2) all children aged 0-9 in the kebele with ocular C. trachomatis infection by PCR plus annual mass azithromycin distribution results in lower prevalence of ocular chlamydia and elimination in the kebele compared to (3) WHO-recommended annual mass azithromycin distribution alone. The results of this trial are expected to lead to evidence of alternative antibiotic-based strategies that may more reliably lead to complete elimination in geographic areas larger than a village."
"9458985","The US FDA has not approved any medications for the treatment of methamphetamine (METH) use disorders. Currently, cognitive-behavioral and contingency-management interventions are the most effective treatments. IXT-m200, a monoclonal antibody that specifically binds METH in the blood, is being developed as a pharmacological treatment for use in conjunction with behavior therapies. Based on nonclinical studies, IXT-m200 is expected to alter METH pharmacokinetics in human subjects resulting in reduced or blocked METH subjective effects that reinforce METH use. STAMPOUT, a Phase 2a Study of Antibody for Methamphetamine Outpatient Therapy, will provide proof-of-concept that IXT-m200 can alter METH disposition. This is needed before a large efficacy study can be done. This application proposes the first clinical study in METH users of a biological medication developed specifically for patients with METH use disorders. The primary goal of this application is to show that a METH antibody will alter the pharmacokinetics of METH in users and reduce the reinforcing subjective effects that perpetuate METH use. During the STAMPOUT study, METH-using subjects will receive single doses of IXT-m200 followed by weekly METH challenges. Serial blood samples and urine collections will be analyzed to determine the METH pharmacokinetic changes due to the antibody dose. Drug effects questionnaires given after METH challenges will quantify the impact of IXT-m200 on the subjective effects of METH. These data will be used to determine the minimum serum concentration of IXT-m200 necessary for reducing reinforcing subjective effects of METH. Also during this project, there will be interaction with the FDA and the overall clinical development plan will be advanced by planning for a Phase 2b/3 clinical study in larger groups of users who wish to quit using METH. Stability testing of the IXT-m200 drug product will continue throughout the study, along with additional manufacturing work as necessary to support the STAMPOUT study. A highly experienced, transdisciplinary academic and industry team will accomplish the following Specific Aims: 1) Advance the clinical development of IXT-m200 by interacting with FDA and planning for future studies, 2) Complete STAMPOUT, a Phase 2a Study of Antibody for Methamphetamine Outpatient Therapy, and 3) Perform manufacturing tasks required to support a clinical study of IXT-m200. STAMPOUT is a turning point. With proof-of-concept data, plans can be made to study long-term efficacy of IXT-m200 in helping METH users quit and move this game changing medication toward the market and the patients who need it."
"9446140","Formation of the CNS during embryogenesis requires the de novo initiation of neural gene expression in embryonic ectoderm. E.g., the Hoxb1a and Hoxb1b transcription factors (TFs) are required for zebrafish hindbrain development, but it is unclear how they activate gene expression. In particular, embryonic chromatin is compacted, making regulatory elements inaccessible to most TFs. We find that Prep and Pbx (two TFs identified as cofactors to Hox proteins) occupy genetic loci prior to zygotic genome activation ? many hours before Hox proteins are active and well before hindbrain development is initiated. Also, Prep:Pbx occupied sites co-localize with binding sites for the NFY TF. We hypothesize that maternally deposited Prep:Pbx cooperates with NFY to open chromatin at hindbrain genes. This process exposes binding sites for hindbrain-specific TFs (e.g. Hox proteins) to drive gene expression in the hindbrain.  There are three aims of our proposed work: First we will disrupt Prep:Pbx and NFY function to determine if they modulate the chromatin state. Second, we will determine if Prep:Pbx-mediated chromatin changes promote binding by Hoxb1b to create hindbrain- specific enhancers. Lastly, we will determine how such enhancers drive hindbrain-specific gene expression.  This work is relevant for several reasons. First, it is important to understand hindbrain development per se (as defects give rise to ataxias etc.). Second, our results will be applicable to understanding hox function in general, which is important since other hox genes are involved in hindbrain development (and many other cell fate decisions). Additionally, prep and pbx are proto-oncogenes and it is likely that their ability to drive de novo gene expression will explain some of their oncogenic potential. Lastly, our experiments will show how genes can be activated in inaccessible chromatin. This will be applicable to targeted differentiation/reprogramming of stem or precursor cells ? hence our work will also inform efforts to generate specific cell types for clinical applications."
"9551721","Project Summary  It has been estimated that 1.4 million people in the United States suffer from Lewy body dementia (LBD), including both dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) or Parkinson's disease with dementia (PDD). Patients with LBD suffer from cognitive decline, sometimes linked to Alzheimer's disease (AD), and the motor and behavioral changes seen in Parkinson's disease (PD). Unfortunately, the diagnosis of LBD can be difficult, particularly in those DLB patients that present with cognitive impairment prior to motor or marked behavioral changes. Biomarkers for LBD are few and their value in diagnosis, prognosis, and for treatment response is limited.  Impediments to biomarker development in LBD have included small subject numbers, a lack of systematic patient characterization, and a failure to perform longitudinal follow up with autopsy. Both AD and PD have benefited from a number of large ?consortiums? that have advanced research by leveraging the strengths of several groups of research centers to combine efforts with standardized approaches to the study of the disease. One good example is the Alzheimer's Disease Centers (ADC) program, funded by the National Institute on Aging, where over 30 research centers across the United States have agreed to a standardized approach to the diagnosis and characterization of patients with AD. Other similar programs include the Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study (ADCS), Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) Parkinson's Disease Biomarker Program (PDBP), and the Parkinson's Progression Marker Initiative (PPMI). Fortunately, the latter two PD programs have included more systematic clinical assessments and collection of biofluids and imaging data relevant to cognition in PD. Recently, a pathology component has been added to the PPMI project. No similar program exists for DLB.  The objective of this proposal is to establish a consortium of centers for the study of DLB with a large number of subject enrolled, systematic assessments (compatible with AD and PD programs), collection of biofluids and imaging data, and ultimately autopsy. The DLB consortium (DLBC) would create the necessary foundation for biomarker development and have the secondary benefit of creating an ongoing subject sample available for additional translational and therapeutic studies. We have brought together nine centers with expertise in the Lewy body disorders and with strong connections to the Lewy body dementia research and general community to participate in the DLBC. This group of investigators has collaborated extensively together for many years and will provide the foundation for this much needed resource."
"9360686","Applicant: Tommy V. Vo Project Summary / Abstract Regulation of gene expression is fundamental to human health and disease. The fact that gene misregulation is a hallmark characteristic of all cancers underscores the importance of maintaining the appropriate pattern of gene expression that defines various cell types. Work in the model fission yeast, Schizosaccharomyces pombe, has begun to reveal a highly complex, dynamic, and conserved model of genome-wide gene silencing where distinct modes of silencing are utilized at different regions of the genome. A common feature throughout all regions with transcriptional potential is the presence of RNA polymerase II (Pol II). Here, we propose to uncover how Pol II can serve as a signal integrator that directs a wide range of different silencing mechanisms across the genome to enable gene silencing. Using a combination of stable-isotope labeling with amino acids in cell culture (SILAC) and Precision nuclear run-on and sequencing (PRO-seq), we will comprehensively elucidate the role of paused Pol II in gene regulation. This work will help shed light into how different gene silencing pathways can be directed in healthy and diseased cells."
"9348181","ABSTRACT/PROJECT SUMMARY  Alzheimer?s disease (AD) is characterized by hyperphosphorylated tau protein which causes impaired axonal transport in neurons. In recent years, multiple researchers have determined that oxidative stress appears to be a significant early event in the pathogenesis of AD in preclinical AD models and in AD patients. We have shown that reducing oxidative stress through quenching of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) results in significant improvements in AD pathology in mice. Unfortunately, targeting oxidative stress to date has not been efficacious clinically in mitigating AD pathology. Dietary antioxidants are low potency, require high doses, are potentially toxic at those doses and have not proven clinically effective. There is thus an urgent clinical need to develop potent, stable intracellular antioxidants for the treatment of AD.  Polyethylene glycol (PEG)-conjugated hydrophilic carbon clusters (PEG-HCCs) are novel nanoparticle antioxidants that convert superoxide to O2 faster than many single-active-site catalysts. These are also stable, soluble, and non-toxic at moderately high concentrations. We have shown that PEG-HCCs enter cells and preferentially accumulate at or near mitochondria. We hypothesize that PEG-HCCs inhibit action of IL-6 via ROS quenching, which then prevents increased activity of p35 and cdk5, resulting in a normalization of hyperphosphorylated tau and a reduction in AD pathology. The PEG-HCC technology has been awarded multiple patents. Acelerox has obtained the international license to the relevant patents for all fields of use and is set to fully explore and develop the unique properties of this novel nanomaterial in treating Alzheimer?s disease.  In this proposal we seek to conduct key animal experiments to establish proof of principle of this novel therapy in animal models of AD. In Aim 1, we will Investigate repeated intranasal administration as a potential route of delivery of PEG-HCCs. In Aim 2, we will perform a proof-of-concept experiment to establish efficacy of PEG-HCC in mouse model of tauopathy.  In summary, we will evaluate a novel class of nano-antioxidants, the PEG-HCCs, to effectively reduce ROS in a tau model of AD. We are in the unique position to use these highly active, bioavailable, and selective antioxidant nanomaterials to test the hypothesis that oxidative stress is a viable therapeutic option in treating AD and also begin to assess the mechanisms of improvement in a pre-clinical system. The extensive data generated using these nanoparticles suggest that they are taken up by cells and targeted to mitochondria, the primary source of antioxidants and appear to be well tolerated."
"9282294","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Engineered nanomaterials (ENMs) have an unknown toxic potential and the relationship between the biological effects and the physicochemical properties remains uncertain. Our long-term research goal is to enable an efficient and accurate safety profiling of ENM of varying characteristics and conditions of exposure that would enhance decision-making regarding human exposure risks. Our objective in this application is to determine serum compositional changes resulting from pulmonary ENM exposure that lead to systemic toxicity (vascular and neural, primarily). We propose the following specific aims, which will pair innovative ex vivo bioactivity outputs with advanced high-resolution mass spec compositional analysis. In the first Aim, we will ascertain mechanisms of pulmonary origin of modified circulatory components related to metalloproteinase activity and inflammation. Evidence suggests that circulating factors may be related to a) direct reactions of ENMs and pulmonary cellular/molecular components or b) degradation by-products of increased metalloproteinase activity and that the circulating components act through endothelial cell surface pattern recognition receptors. In the second Aim, we will assess neurovascular and central nervous system impacts arising from pulmonary ENM- induced serome modifications. Here, we will develop and optimize a sequence tag-based algorithm to enhance the identification of endogenous peptides within the multi-walled carbon nanotube (MWCNT)-responsive serome, which will facilitate evaluation of the ENM-induced bioactivation in the cerebrovasculature and the diffusivity of ENM-responsive serome factors across the blood brain barrier. Lastly, in the third Aim, we will assess MWCNT-associated circulatory characteristics and inflammatory potential in samples derived from an occupationally-exposed cohort. We will assess the serum bioactivity in terms of endothelial activation and link to personal breathing zone measurements of elemental carbon, a marker of carbon nanotube/nanofiber exposure. At the completion of this project, we expect to have identified key physiological and chemical factors that influence plasma-borne ENM toxicity. The successful completion of these studies is expected to constitute an important step towards preventing / attenuating adverse health effects associated with ENM exposure. An added benefit will be the generation of novel diagnostic technologies and biomarkers that can not only strengthen, but also expedite ENM safety assessments and exposure monitoring. The research results will directly address Strategic Goals 1, 2, and 4 of the 2013-2016 NIOSH Nanotechnology Research and Guidance Strategic Plan."
"9418357","Project Summary Approximately 3 million Americans and around 24 million people worldwide are affected by Type 1 Diabetes (T1D). Glucose monitoring followed by insulin injection, allogeneic whole organ pancreas transplantation, and allogeneic islet transplantation are the most common treatments for T1D. These treatments can achieve glycemic control for many patients but result in serious complications. A bioartificial pancreas is a promising treatment for T1D because it contains functional islets. However, previous attempts to develop a bioartificial device have been severely limited by insufficient mass transfer and a limited supply of beta cells. Dr. Shuvo Roy (PI) has developed silicon nanopore membranes (SNM) to achieve high-efficiency blood ultrafiltration while selectively retaining specific solutes for the Bioartificial Kidney project and this project's successes are directly transferrable to the implantable bioartificial pancreas (the iBAP). The ultra-high hydraulic permeability characteristic of the SNM will enable appropriate mass transport (especially oxygen, glucose, and insulin) within to achieve optimal beta cell performance, while the ultra-selective pore characteristic of the SNM enable unprecedented immunoisolation. Also the iBAP will utilize a human embryonic stem cell derived fully functional beta cell that provides and unlimited supply of beta cells for iBAP development and clinical translation."
"9336979","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The capacity for memory is one of the most profound features of the mammalian brain, and the proper encoding and retrieval of information are the processes that form the basis of learning. The centrality of learning and memory to all aspects of mammalian life underscores the devastating nature of degenerative neurological disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease and schizophrenia that impair the hippocampus and compromise these processes. Although the hippocampal formation is one of the most extensively studied structures in the brain, the circuit mechanisms underlying its normal function remain elusive. Hippocampal principal cells form complex representations of the external environment, but in stark contrast to the diversity of inhibitory interneurons catalogued and despite the apparent need for functional segregation, they are largely considered a homogeneous population. The goal of this proposed research is to investigate functional segregation within the pyramidal cell population at the output node of the hippocampus, area CA1. In particular, given known developmental, genetic, and connectivity differences between superficial and deep cells in this region, we aim to explore the functional differences between these subpopulations and their relative contributions to learning and memory.  This proposal implements numerous recent advances in optical imaging and genetic perturbation methods in the mouse, allowing us to longitudinally monitor and manipulate the activity of large populations of hippocampal neurons with submicron spatial resolution over days to weeks as the animal engages in various learning paradigms. In area CA1 principal cells form representations of the external world through their coordinated firing patterns. While spatial representations of static environments persist over long time periods, firing patterns in the CA1 principal cell population change dramatically over the course of learning. This proposal will test the hypothesis that superficial and deep CA1 principal cells demonstrate different coding dynamics during spatial navigation behaviors and learning tasks. Preliminary data from a head-fixed spatial navigation task suggests that spatial representations in the superficial CA1 pyramidal cell population are highly stable over many days, while firing patterns in the deep population are far more variable, suggesting a functional difference between these subpopulations and perhaps satisfying the need for both stability and flexibility in hippocampal codes. This proposal will also implement pharmacogenetic manipulations to test the hypothesis that coding differences between these subpopulations are the causal basis for differential contributions to learning and memory. In summary this work will use chronic head-fixed two- photon imaging of different subpopulations of CA1 pyramidal cells during learning in the awake rodent to further our understanding of functional subdivision in the hippocampal circuit."
"9318777","PROJECT SUMMARY The objective of this continuation project, submitted in response to PA-16-242 (Bioengineering Research Grants), is to study the mechanism of presbyopia, the progressive age-related loss of the ability to see clearly at near distances. The long-term goal is to enable the development of effective strategies to restore accommodation in presbyopes. The project addresses two critical barriers to progress in the field: a) the need for a better understanding of the factors contributing to presbyopia, particularly the role of the ciliary muscle and b) the need for technologies that can objectively assess the outcomes of procedures to restore accommodation in a clinical setting. The project has two specific aims: Aim 1: To develop a high speed integrated multimodal accommodation biometry system The accommodation biometry system will build on a first generation of the system that was developed in the previous project period. The system will combine a dynamic autorefractor and two optical coherence tomography systems in an integrated hardware and software platform that will enable acquisition of data by a single user in a clinical setting. It will enable high-speed and precisely synchronized measurements of the dynamics of ciliary muscle movement, changes in shape of the crystalline lens, and changes in refraction in response to pulse-step and ramp stimuli of accommodation. Aim 2: To characterize the dynamics of the ciliary muscle with accommodation and age The accommodation biometry system will be used to quantify the dynamics of the ciliary muscle and the resulting changes in crystalline lens shape in participants with ages ranging from 14 to 74 years and in cataract surgery patients who will be imaged pre-operatively and one month after IOL implantation. The data will be analyzed to test the predictions that a) there are age- related changes in the dynamics of the ciliary muscle and its interaction with the lens in the age range leading to presbyopia; b) presbyopia is associated with alterations in the ciliary muscle morphology that may affect the ability to restore accommodation; and c) replacement of the natural lens with an artificial implant alters the ability of the ciliary muscle to respond to an accommodation stimulus. The project will have a broad impact on the field of presbyopia research. It will produce new technology to image the ciliary muscle of the eye and its interaction with the lens in real-time during accommodation. It will also generate new knowledge on the causes of presbyopia that will form a sound physiological basis for the development and optimization of new procedures and implants designed to restore accommodation."
"9421501","SUMMARY The overarching objective of our proposal is to bring noninvasive human brain imaging into the microscale (50-500 micron isotropic) resolution in order to create a tool for studies of neuronal circuitry and network organization in the human brain. Our breakthrough technology, MR Corticography (MRCoG), represents substantial advances over existing MRI approaches. MRCoG achieves dramatic gains in spatial and temporal resolutions by focusing several different types of coil arrays on the cerebral cortex of the live human brain. These optimized high-density receiver arrays with 128 coils also serve as a shim array and thereby obtain much higher quality imaging. High-performance magnetic field gradients will be combined with state-of-the-art pulse sequences to produce over 30-times acceleration in echo planar imaging. This will enable us to reach 0.4 mm resolution in fMRI studies of the entire cerebral cortex. This unprecedented spatial resolution in human fMRI is sufficient to identify functional activity at different depth in the cortex corresponding to different cortical layers. MRCoG will also be used to achieve 100-200 micron resolution susceptibility contrast images and this enables us to map intra-cortical axon connections and the cytoarchitecture of human cortex. With over 10 times higher resolution than current 7T scanners, MRCoG will overcome current scale limitations in imaging the function and structure of cortical layers and columns.  The evaluation and refinement of MRCoG will entail using advanced computational models of brain circuitry, feedforward and feedback neuronal circuit models and computational models for decoding the brain using data from layer specific and column specific fMRI. Functional and structural MRI performed with MRCoG will generate new avenues to explore human brain circuitry at an order of magnitude higher spatial resolution, while importantly image the entire cortex rather than by current approaches (e.g. zoomed imaging) that measure only small areas of cortex.  Many existing 7T MRI scanners will be able to incorporate MRCoG high-resolution technology; therefore, MRCoG can be rapidly disseminated to neuroscience research centers and used to advance medical discoveries. We will evaluate MRCoG ability to resolve currently unobservable cortex abnormalities in epilepsy and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and to improve localization and mapping of abnormal circuitry in the brain."

Working within the interdisciplinary environment (e.g., imaging sciences; image reconstruction and processing; pharmacokinetics) of the Gordon Center, the aim of CMITT is to develop, validate and disseminate cutting-edge imaging technologies that take advantage of the game-changing capabilities afforded by simultaneous acquisition of PET and MR. CMITT consists of three Technology Research and Development projects (TR&Ds): TR&D1 aims at breaking down the resolution barrier in PET. By developing enabling technologies for attenuation and motion field estimation as well as PSH modeling we can achieve the intrinsic resolution of PET, about 4mm, in the breathing patient by using novel accelerated MR acquisitions with sparse sampling. TR&D2 will develop the unified statistical model of joint reconstruction of PET and MR that incorporates the corrections developed in TR&D1. TR&D3 will develop the pharmacokinetic modeling of physiological processes in simultaneous PET/MR (TR&D3) in quantitative PET/MR images that enable exploration of molecular physiology. There is currently no PET-focused Biomedical Technology Resource Center supported by NIBIB. Thus CMITT seeks to fill a clear national need for PET/MR imaging technology development, one that is agnostic with respect to commercial platform and, in many instances, applies equally to PET or MR alone. The Resource provides a unique environment with an interdisciplinary team of highly accomplished scientists, engineers, and clinicians with diverse expertise in multiple modalities and disciplines that supports service use of the Center's facilities by imaging scientists throughout the country as well as Europe, Asia and Australia. CMITT will provide extensive training opportunities for students, post-doctoral fellows, and faculty, and seeks to advance the field of molecular imaging of normal function and disease through active dissemination of new knowledge and technology."
"9455051","PROJECT SUMMARY Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), the most common aggressive type of lymphomas, is characterized by marked clinical and pathological heterogeneity that is reflected at the molecular level. It is well known that although the incidence rates for DLBCL were lower for African Americans (AA) than for European Americans (EA), AA patients were diagnosed at a significantly younger age and have worse 5-year survival compared with EA patients. The reason for this apparent racial/ethnic difference is unclear and cannot be fully explained by social stressors or access to care. We speculate that epigenetic variations could underlie the racial/ethnic differences because the pathogenesis of DLBCL is strongly linked to perturbation of epigenetic mechanisms, and population-specific cytosine modifications are a fundamental feature between human populations. In addition, greater epigenetic heterogeneity is linked with more aggressive DLBCL and poorer survival outcomes. Most prior studies of DLBCL epigenetics have assessed 5-methylcytosines (5mC) in predominantly EA patients. No studies have evaluated 5-hydroxymethylcytosines (5hmC), an emerging stable and abundant modification with distinct gene regulatory and cellular functions, due mainly to technical limitations. Most importantly, no studies have assessed concurrently 5mC and 5hmC in both EA and AA DLBCL patients. Without an effective technique to obtain the complete landscape of modified cytosines, development of targeted epigenetic approaches to improve DLBCL disparities is unlikely. The objective of this Exploratory/Developmental study is to distinguish 5hmC from 5mC at the time of DLBCL diagnosis between AA and EA patients and evaluate their clinical significance. Our hypothesis is that the 5mC/5hmC signatures in tumor tissues differ between AA and EA patients and that these differences contribute to the well-known racial/ethnic differences in DLBCL risk and outcomes. The Specific Aims are to 1) distinguish 5hmC from 5mC in EA and AA patients and evaluate population-specific 5mC/5hmC loci; and 2) determine therapeutic response-associated 5hmC/5mC loci. Specifically, we will obtain tissues for 120 patients with DLBCL (60 AA and 60 EA) from the University of Chicago Lymphoma Biobank. We will combine an innovative technique, the Tet-assisted Bisulfite Sequencing (TAB-Seq) and the new Illumina EPIC array to accurately distinguish 5hmC from 5mC. We will perform an epigenome-wide scan to assess differences in 5hmC/5mC modification levels between AA and EA patients at presentation and also integrate both modifications to predict therapeutic response, defined as relapse within 24 months after treatment. This proposal addresses a critical research question in a highly innovative, cost-efficient, and timely manner, providing important data for the first time on the complete landscape of modified cytosines for racial/ethnic differences in DLBCL. The results are expected to have positive impact because it is possible that the identified epigenetic loci/biomarkers will provide new targets for individualized preventive and therapeutic interventions to decrease mortality and burden of DLBCL."
"9471098","Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a severe medical problem experienced by humans with high mortality and long term morbidity. Unfortunately, there has been no effective treatment available for SCI patients. The lumbar motoneurons (MNs) are the final common pathway for motor output to the hindlimbs. Any impairment of these MNs can cause hindlimb paralysis and muscle atrophy. When SCI occurs above the lumbar level, namely above-level injury, the lumbar MNs are not directly damaged by the trauma, but they undergo profound dendritic atrophy and synaptic stripping. While most SCI studies to date have focused on the regeneration or protection of the injured spinal cord at the injury site, few studies have explored how modulation of lumbar MN circuitry would affect pathological and functional consequences after an above-level SCI. Our goal is to develop a beneficial restorative treatment targeting lumbar MNs after an above-level SCI and to functionally dissect out how individual afferent pathways affect lumbar MN remodeling and functional recovery. In this application, we propose a central hypothesis that increasing local NT-3 levels at lumbar MN pools will stimulate the recruitment of spared axons from distinct afferent pathways and enhance their synaptic formation onto lumbar MNs. Thus, reestablishment of neural circuitry at the lumbar level forms the anatomical basis for hindlimb functional recovery after an above-level SCI. Accordingly, three specific aims are proposed to investigate the three major afferent pathways to influencing lumbar MNs function to determine their roles in NT- 3-mediated remodeling of lumbar motor circuitry and hindlimb recovery after a thoracic SCI. These pathways include the descending reticulospinal tracts (RetST), the descending propriospinal tracts (dPST), and the dorsal roots (DR) afferents. Once the functional role of each specific pathway is defined, we will used combinational approaches to target multiple pathways to maximize the treatment effect. This will be done u sing an adult mouse thoracic 9 (T9) contusive SCI model and an AAV2-NT-3 gene transfer approach to increase the level of NT-3 in MNs."
"9433004","Project Summary Abstract:  National-level data for gender minorities? health and healthcare use is scarce, in part because measures of gender minority identity are rarely collected in national health surveys, electronic health records, or administrative databases. Emerging early evidence in this under-studied population shows that gender minority persons (i.e., transgender or gender non-binary persons; GMs henceforth) experience high mental and physical health burdens and high levels of discrimination in medical settings. Such findings prompted the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to designate GMs as a health disparity population in 2016, calling for increased data collection about GM identities and analyses of GM health and healthcare disparities. Healthcare disparities research about disabled and/or elderly GMs is particularly scarce, despite the fact that they appear to be at especially high risk for depression and chronic illness. There is no consensus methodology for measuring GM healthcare disparities, which may weaken efforts to identify and reduce disparities. Using a novel algorithm to identify elderly and/or disabled GMs in Medicare claims (capturing those who are medically transitioning or ever diagnosed with Gender Identity Disorder [GID]), this project characterizes service use disparities between GM and non-GM patients on (a) treatment for diagnosed depression and (b) use of medical care among patients with chronic conditions. In Aim 1, we rigorously measure healthcare use disparities for GM vs. non-GM Medicare beneficiaries who are elderly and/or disabled by adapting a theoretically grounded healthcare disparities definition originally developed to measure racial/ethnic disparities. This methodology measures disparities by separating the differences in healthcare use that arise from differences in clinical need or patient preferences from the ?unallowable? differences (i.e., disparities) that are mediated through factors such as discrimination, socioeconomic status, and structural healthcare system factors. These methods require non-linear modeling strategies and transformation of covariate distributions. In Aim 2, we quantify what portion of the observed disparity is explained by factors at the individual- and area-level, including race/ethnicity, SES, neighborhood composition, and healthcare supply. Applying the IOM framework to GM disparities research has the potential to unify research methods in GM disparities studies, facilitating comparisons across studies and across healthcare measures so that disparities can be tracked over time. Decomposing the measured disparities into component parts may help identify targets for clinical and policy reform."

"9330151","PROJECT SUMMARY This project proposes a comprehensive five-year mentored research development program with transition to independence. The research plan investigates the severe clinical problem of intestinal fibrosis and stricture formation in inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). It explores the entirely novel concept of a direct effect of bacterial components on intestinal mesenchymal cells, the chief pro-fibrotic cell type, in vitro and in vivo. We found that human intestinal myofibroblasts respond to activation of bacterial sensing pattern recognition receptors, but only flagellin increases secretion of the extracellular matrix (ECM) components fibronectin and collagen 1. This response is post-transcriptionally regulated and dependent on caspase 1, implicating the inflammasome in intestinal fibrosis. Therefore, we propose to explore the following hypothesis: the gut microbiota induces intestinal fibrosis through a flagellin mediated pathway. This hypothesis will be tested through three interrelated, but indepedent specific aims: (1) to define the mechanisms of flagellin- induced post-transcriptional regulation of ECM secretion in vitro (2) to determine the role of flagellin mediated inflammasome activation in the pro-fibrogenic responses in primary human mesenchymal cells in vitro and (3) to explore the effect of abrogating flagellin signaling in experimental fibrosis in vivo during induction and resolution of intestinal fibrosis. Post-transcriptional regulation and inflammasome activation via caspase 1 are two entirely original mechanisms of intestinal fibrosis. We will use a cutting edge transgenic mouse model that allows control of the timing of deletion of bacterial sensing in vivo specifically in mesenchymal cells. This enables exploration of microbial sensing in the prevention and resolution of intestinal fibrosis. The research will be carried out in the laboratory of Dr. Fiocchi MD, Lerner Research Institute (LRI), Cleveland Clinic, and will be advised by a panel of international experts in human and experimental fibrogenesis, translational regulation and the microbiota. The advisory panel has worked out a structured career development program, including formal coursework in microbiology, translational regulation and statistics. An ideal intellectual and technical environment is in place locally in the LRI. My career goal is to build and lead an independent research program that will advance scientific knowledge and patient care in the field of intestinal fibrosis. My prior experience with primary human cell systems and animal models gives me the ideal basis to be a successful K08 awardee. The proposed study will provide novel evidence for the direct effect of the microbiota in intestinal mesenchymal cell induced fibrogenesis and stricture formation. These findings could lead to a completely novel approach of targeting the microbiota as a therapeutic strategy to abrogate fibrosis."

"9392616","PROJECT SUMMARY  Childhood asthma and obesity are pressing health epidemics in the United States that disproportionately impact children who are minorities and come from households with lower incomes. Asthma in obese children tends to be more severe and refractory to treatment. An emerging explanatory hypothesis is that these children may be more vulnerable to components of air pollution. Secondhand smoke is a dominant source of indoor air pollution, particularly in the inner city, where up to 80% of children with asthma are regularly exposed. The differential effects of secondhand smoke based on weight are not known.  We hypothesize that secondhand smoke is preferentially deleterious to overweight or obese children with asthma, and that this relationship may correlate with differences in inflammation and oxidative stress. Because obesity is associated with basal elevations in inflammation and because asthma is associated with enhanced inflammation and oxidative stress, we believe that this is a plausible biologic mechanism.  We have discovered compelling preliminary evidence from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) that children who are overweight or obese report greater symptoms when exposed to secondhand smoke as compared to normal weight children. This project extends the results of this analysis to a local level, in more well-characterized cohorts of children who have both symptom and blood biomarker assessment. This study will be performed in (1) two large observational cohorts of children with asthma, comparing those who are and are not exposed to secondhand smoke, and in (2) an interventional cohort of children with asthma who are all exposed to secondhand smoke and have subsequent reductions in secondhand smoke exposure through the use of an advanced air purifier, comparing differences in asthma improvement between those who are normal weight and overweight or obese.  As body mass index is an imperfect marker for adiposity, this project will also examine if other different measures of adiposity, waist circumference and percentage body fat as estimated by bioelectrical impedance analysis, perform better than body mass index in identifying this vulnerable group."

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The objective of this application is to develop the career of Dr. Christian Badr to facilitate the transition to a stable independent phase and attain his ultimate goal to become an independent scientist and establish his own research program. The career development plan created by the candidate will contribute substantially to his scientific development and further his training in proteomics, RNAi and cancer stem cells biology. The proposed opportunity in the K22 will provide the PI protected time while starting his independent Faculty position and direct him towards a successful career in developing therapeutics for brain tumors. The proposed research will also serve as the foundation for an R01 proposal prior to the end of the second year of this award. Glioma stem cells (GSC) represent a subset population within malignant gliomas, and are highly tumorigenic, intrinsically resistant to current therapies, and capable of self-renewal and differentiation into mature glioma cells (GCs). There are two major subtypes of GSCs: Proneural (PN) and Mesenchymal (MES), the latter being more aggressive and more resistant to conventional treatment. We have identified a subpopulation of GSCs, termed floating cells (FC) that could be isolated from in vitro-cultured glioma cells. These cells possess a stem-like signature with prominent mesenchymal features. They tend to be more aggressive when implanted into the brain of nude mice as compared to their parental GSCs line and have a superior resistance to radiation and therapy. Due to such properties, FC represents an ideal model to identify and test new GBM therapeutics. In Aim 1 of this proposal we will use quantitative mass spectrometry to perform a proteomic analysis on different models of PN and MES GSCs including the FC population. This work will provide a deeper characterization of the FCs and identify differentially expressed proteins/pathways in PN and MES GSCs, which could be exploited to develop new therapeutics. In Aim 2, we will use imaging-based reporters and perform an RNAi screen to identify GSCs modulators which either push GSCs to a more differentiated state, making them susceptible to conventional therapy, or simply kill these cells. Finally we will test a novel gene delivery approach based on extracellular vesicles packaged in adeno-associated virus vectors (vAAV) to deliver our therapeutic RNAi to brain tumors in mice. This work can add valuable information for understanding the biology of this elusive tumor population and plasticity between GSCs subtypes. It also has the potential to identify new vulnerabilities and therapeutic avenues for PN and MES gliomas."
"9361548","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):      Project Background. Homeless Veterans smoke at an inordinately high rate (80%) compared to the general U.S. population (20%), and thus are at increased risk for the lethal effects of cigarette smoking. Smoking cessation treatment including smoking cessation aids such as nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) are greatly underutilized, particularly among homeless Veteran smokers. There is a special need to develop effective interventions that target homeless Veterans. Homeless Veterans are significantly less likely to access intensive clinic-based smoking cessation care. While the efforts of our group and others have expanded the reach of smoking cessation treatment options beyond the clinic to include tele-medicine, cognitive-behavioral telephone counseling, and internet based interventions, it has been suggested that there is a need for more innovative and intensive approaches to smoking cessation in order to improve quit rates, particularly among homeless Veterans. The use of intensive behavioral therapies, such as contingency management (CM), may be a useful component for smoking cessation interventions among homeless Veterans. CM has shown efficacy for reducing smoking in other difficult-to-treat populations. Project Objectives. The primary goal of the current study is to evaluate the effectiveness of an intervention that combines evidenced-based treatment for smoking cessation with smart-phone based, portable contingency management on smoking rates compared to a VA smoking cessation specialty care intervention in a randomized controlled trial among homeless Veteran smokers. Specifically, 126 Veterans will be randomized to receive Abstinence Reinforcement Therapy (ART) which combines evidenced based cognitive-behavioral telephone counseling, a tele-medicine clinic for access to NRT, and mobile contingency management (mCM), or to receive VA smoking cessation specialty care intervention. The specific aims and hypotheses are: AIM 1: To investigate the impact of ART on rates of abstinence from cigarettes at post-treatment, 3-month and 6- month post-treatment follow-ups. Hypothesis 1: Abstinence rates will be significantly higher among Veterans randomized to the ART-based intervention than those randomized to the VA smoking cessation specialty care control arm. AIM 2: To evaluate the relative cost-effectiveness of the ART intervention. Hypothesis 2: ART based treatment will result in greater cost-effectiveness compared to the control condition as measured by the incremental cost- effectiveness ratio. AIM 3: To assess potential treatment mediators including self-efficacy-related mechanisms. Hypothesis 3: Increased abstinence associated with ART will be partially mediated by increased self-efficacy compared to the VA specialty care control condition. Project Methods and Expected Results. Proposed is a four year project in which 126 homeless Veteran smokers will be randomized to receive either a multi-component Abstinence Reinforcement Therapy or a VA specialty care control intervention. Participating patients will be surveyed at post-treatment, 3-months and 6- months post-randomization. The primary outcome of the trial is prolonged self-reported abstinence at the 6-month follow-up, verified by cotinine assay. It is expected that ART will improve quit rates among homeless Veterans, and compared to specialty care, will be associated with greater cost-effectiveness."
"9450222","Project Abstract Spontaneous canine osteosarcoma (OS) is a well-defined large animal model of human OS, exhibiting similar clinical presentation and molecular aberrations. Indeed, canine OS has historically been used to help develop novel limb spare techniques, evaluate a variety of non-specific immunotherapeutics such as L-MTP-PE, and assess the efficacy of targeted therapeutics to prevent the outgrowth of metastatic disease. Despite best efforts, progress in the prevention and treatment of metastatic disease has essentially stalled for the past 3 decades; 30% of people and 90% of dogs still die of tumor spread, primarily to the lungs. Numerous clinical trials have been undertaken in people with macroscopic metastases and in dogs with both microscopic and macroscopic disease, yet all have failed to demonstrate improved outcomes. This is particularly evident with respect to immune checkpoint inhibitors that do not induce the dramatic disease regressions typically observed in other cancers such as melanoma and lung cancer. One particularly daunting challenge for immunotherapy-based therapeutics in OS relates to the permissiveness of the tumor microenvironment (TME) for inducing anti-tumor immune responses. Our data suggests that a relatively low mutational load combined with a dampened overall immune response in OS may contribute to the observed lack of response to current treatment approaches. We propose that targeting the immune suppressive TME in OS is essential to generating potent and durable anti- tumor immunity. To accomplish this, it may be necessary to simultaneously modulate several elements in the TME, including Tregs, MDSCs, M2 macrophages and overexpressed inhibitory checkpoint molecules. In support of this, we have generated a body of data demonstrating immunological activity of multiple therapeutics, including repurposed drugs with good safety records (losartan, oclacitinib), small molecule inhibitors with established PK/PD in dogs (toceranib, RV1001, reparixin, JHU-292) and antibodies specific for checkpoint molecules (anti- PD1). However, the exact combinations that are most effective against metastatic OS have not yet been identified, and this is a major goal of this proposal. As such, we hypothesize that an adaptive pilot trial design can be used to rapidly screen TME-targeting immunotherapy drug combinations in dogs with macroscopic chemotherapy-resistant metastatic OS and that this information can be refined to assess activity of the most active approach against microscopic metastases in a subsequent adjuvant trial. This will be accomplished by testing four TME modifying immunotherapy combinations for anti-tumor and immune modulatory activity in dogs with macroscopic OS metastases, interrogating relevant biomarkers associated with responses to therapy, then using this information to conduct an adjuvant immunotherapy trial with the most active combination in dogs with microscopic metastatic OS. The data generated from this proposal will create a blueprint for future immunotherapy studies in people with OS by eliminating approaches deemed inactive and generating a set of clinical biomarkers to guide treatment."
"9469684","PROJECT SUMMARY NMDA receptor hypofunction has been implicated in neuropsychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia, a disabling mental disorder that affects over 2.2 million patients in the US. One modality for NMDA receptor hypofunction is aberrant gating, the process where the receptor converts glutamate binding into opening of the associated ion channel. One pathway to regulate hypofunction is NMDA receptor desensitization, a gating configuration where the receptor is ligand-bound, but the ion channel is non-conducting. However, its physiological and mechanistic basis is poorly defined in part because of the lack of tools to study it. In this proposal I will take advantage of new tools ? single site mutations that selectively alter specific features of NMDA receptor desensitization recently discovered in the Wollmuth lab ? as well as cutting edge technologies to address the mechanism and physiology of NMDA receptor desensitization.  Whereas desensitization in non-NMDA receptors depends almost exclusively on the rearrangement of the ligand-binding domain (LBD) dimer interface, such a mechanism is less significant in NMDA receptors and all domains, most notably the transmembrane domain (TMD), have been implicated in NMDA receptor desensitization. In Aim 1, I will test the general hypothesis that the mechanism of NMDA receptor desensitization is fundamentally different from that of non-NMDA receptors, depending strongly on the conformation of the ion channel. To test this hypothesis, I will take advantage of newly identified single-site mutations, patch clamp electrophysiology as well as techniques to regulate the subunit composition of NMDA receptors and light-activated unnatural amino acids. These experiments will help define the structural mechanisms that govern NMDA receptor desensitization, aiding in the development of novel therapeutics that can selectively modulate NMDA receptor activity by specifically targeting desensitization. In Aim 2, I will test the hypothesis that NMDA receptor desensitization leads to decreased excitatory signaling at synapses during high activity. Indeed, my preliminary data show that fast applications of glutamate caused a higher degree of current decay in these mutants, suggesting a potential role of desensitization in NMDA hypofunction. To test this hypothesis more rigorously, I will express mutant NMDA receptors that have altered desensitization properties in organotypic hippocampal slice cultures to address how they change synaptic dynamics including Ca2+ influx and synaptic plasticity. These experiments will address how NMDA receptor desensitization contributes to synaptic physiology.  The information gained by the experiments in this proposal will provide insight into the mechanism of NMDA receptor desensitization and its role in synaptic dynamics. My experiments will aid in the development of novel therapeutics that selectively modulates NMDA receptor activity by specifically targeting desensitization."

It is also reported to be the leading cause of death and disability in the under-45 age group in industrialized countries. Among the soldiers who survive conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan, traumatic brain injuries account for a larger proportion of thei casualties than in any other war in recent US history. Furthermore, among patients evaluated at the Walter Reed Hospital, closed head injuries significantly outnumber other penetrating injuries. Most individuals with a mild TBI (mTBI) return to normal performance within a year, but moderate and severe brain injuries are more complex and have long-lasting consequences. mTBI is now recognized to be a major health concern for both civilian and military populations. Repetitive injuries may result in dementia like symptoms where the patient may experience memory loss, aggression, confusion and depression. There are very few current clinical trials in the US or even worldwide which are specifically addressing mTBI, and typically the drugs under investigation were developed for other conditions and have shown very little efficacy thus far, presumably due to the lack of knowledge of the molecular mechanisms which constitute the brains' secondary response to mTBI. These numerous and complex mechanisms may persist for months and even years after the event, and the outcome for the patient depends on these, as well as the type, severity and location of the original injury. For effective acute and long-ter treatment of mTBI, the biological events that govern neuronal repair and neuronal damage and death need to be fully understood at the molecular and cellular level.

"9564332","Abstract Previous research has shown that the stress-responsive regulation of protective Nrf2 target gene expression becomes progressively inefficient in aging Drosophila. This loss of responsiveness correlates with decreased fitness and an irreversible erosion of chromatin organization at Nrf2-regulated transcription units. We have developed genetic and pharmacological strategies that can delay the age-associated loss of signal- responsive Nrf2 target gene expression and chromatin disorganization. These effects can be achieved by MafS or Sirt6 overexpression, or by pharmacological treatments that stimulate Nrf2 function throughout adult life. When the Nrf2-mediated transcriptional stress response is thus preserved, older organisms show health benefits that are indicative of a slower rate of aging. These data suggest that the progressive loss of dynamic transcriptional responses to extracellular signals is caused by epigenetic decline and represents a major driver of aging. The discovery of strategies to delay this degenerative process can potentially guide the development of anti-aging interventions. The experimental program described in this proposal will advance the understanding of epigenetic aging at the mechanistic, molecular and genomic level. It will also test and optimize anti-aging strategies that target epigenetic mechanisms.  "
"9449724","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Individuals with Down syndrome (DS) have been largely neglected in therapeutic and biomarker studies of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Adults with DS are uniformly affected by AD pathology by their 30's and have a 70-80% chance of clinical dementia by their 60's. In 95% of cases, DS is associated with three copies of chromosome 21, each containing of copy of the Amyloid-beta (A?) Precursor Protein gene (leading to a 1.5-fold increase in A? protein). Yet, nowhere is it clearer than in DS that A? deposition is not sufficiet to produce dementia, as individuals harbor this pathology for over a decade before cognitive decline is apparent. DS can be seen as a setting of amplified sensitivity to risk and protective factors that moderate the relationship between A?, neurodegeneration and clinical dementia. Understanding the factors that moderate this relationship in DS and biomarkers for those factors is critically important in the design of therapeutic trials for AD in DS and in general. Thus, this longitudinal study of Neurodegeneration in Aging DS (NiAD) and its relationship to cognition has the potential to: 1) identify critical factors that link A? deposition to neurodegeneration and, ultimately, dementia; 2) define biomarkers for these factors; and, most importantly, 3) set a foundation for an efficient transition from this biomarker study to a therapeutic trial to combat A in DS augmented by biomarker outcomes. For the past 5 years, the three independent research groups included in this application have been studying the course of A? deposition and other imaging biomarkers and their impact on cognitive/functional measures in adults with DS [(a) the combined Pittsburgh/Madison study; (b) the Banner Alzheimer's Institute study; and (c) the Cambridge study]. In their ongoing work, 140 adults with DS (including 23 with DS/AD-dementia) have undergone magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and amyloid-positron emission tomography (PET) scans and neuropsychological/ functional assessments. These three research groups now propose to combine resources and harmonize all protocols in response to the request from NIA/NICHD to develop a large AD biomarker study in DS. This study will be further strengthened by aligning NiAD with the three largest ongoing longitudinal studies of AD biomarkers in the general population: the Alzheimer Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), the Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer Network (DIAN) and the Alzheimer Prevention Initiative (API). All data will be made available in an open-access format using a model similar to ADNI. The established DS cohort is a significant advantage that will shorten the recruitment phase, maximize longitudinal data that can be acquired and allow for addition of new biomarkers to be compared to longitudinal clinical and imaging measures. The proposed 5-year longitudinal study will examine progression of AD related biomarkers (A?-, tau- and fluorodeoxyglucose-PET, structural and functional MRI, cerebrospinal fluid A? and tau, plasma A? and proteomics, genetics, neuropathology) and cognitive/functional measures in 180 adults with DS (>25 yrs. of age) and 40 biomarker-controls. Subjects will be re-evaluated every 15 months to assess changes in cognition/adaptive functioning and every 30 months to detect biomarker changes."
"9565789","Title: Regulation of type II cells in the repair of alveolar epithelial injury ABSTRACT  Each year in the United States, there are ~ 200,000 cases of acute lung injury (ALI) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) . Repair of the injured alveolar epithelial barrier is essential for the resolution of ALI/ARDS. However, there is currently a lack of targeted therapies aimed at promoting the repair of the epithelium to restore barrier function. The goal of this project is to understand the signaling events contributing to the endogenous alveolar repair process and identify potential drug targets to accelerate repair. Lung alveoli are lined with two types of epithelial cells: Alveolar Type I cells (AT1) and Type II cells (AT2). AT1 cover ~95% of the surface area because of their thin and squamous shape and are responsible for blood-gas exchange. AT2 have multiple functions including the secretion of surfactant and are also able to act as progenitor cells, proliferating and converting to AT1 after lung injury to restore the alveolar epithelial barrier. However, the signaling events responsible for regulating AT2-mediated repair remain poorly understood. Our preliminary data demonstrated the requirement of a non-canonical Notch ligand Dlk1 (For delta-like 1 homolog) in the AT2 to AT1 differentiation. We found that a dynamic change in Dlk1 expression is correlated with the AT2 to AT1 transition during repair. Using a mouse model in which Dlk1 was specifically disrupted in AT2, we found that the mutant cells were unable to differentiate into AT1 and at mean time had abnormally elevated Notch signaling. Based on these data, we hypothesize that dynamically regulated Notch signaling is essential for the proper progenitor function of AT2 and that Dlk1 plays an essential role in the AT2 to AT1 transition during alveolar repair by inhibiting Notch signaling. We intend to pursue the following specific aims: Aim 1: To test the hypothesis that Dlk1 regulates the AT2 to AT1 transition required for alveolar repair. We will determine the function of Dlk1 in restoring epithelial barrier integrity and gas-exchange function post-injury. We will define the detailed steps in the Dlk1 regulated AT2 to AT1 transition and identifying factors downstream and upstream of Dlk1. Aim 2: To test the hypothesis that the Dlk1-dependent dynamic regulation of the canonical Notch signaling pathway is essential during AT2-mediated alveolar repair. We will determine the role of Notch signaling activity in AT2 at different phases of alveolar repair and investigate the molecular interactions between Dlk1 and Notch receptors and ligands. Finally, we will investigate the effects of improving alveolar repair through the introduction of Dlk1 and other Notch-regulating molecules into alveoli and will further test the roles of Notch/Dlk1 in human AT2 and human iPSC derived AT2. At the conclusion of these studies, we will have filled an important gap in knowledge about the molecular mechanisms underlying alveolar repair. We believe that these studies will lead to the discovery of therapeutic targets to accelerate lung repair and prevent chronic pathological conditions resulting from improper recovery."
"9387784","ABSTRACT . Inherited retinal degenerations affect approximately 1 in 1,500 individuals in the US, and given the extreme genotypic and phenotypic heterogeneity, the prospect of treating these devastating diseases is a formidable task. Nevertheless, trials examining novel therapeutic strategies are underway. An important key to success in the early phases of such trials is selection of patients with reasonable therapeutic potential ? for example, a retina with no remaining cone photoreceptors would not be the best target for a gene therapy approach aiming to restore cone function. In addition, current clinical tools for assessing retinal structure are relatively insensitive and macroscopic, limiting the ability to monitor therapeutic response in these patients. As such, there is a need for sensitive, noninvasive, high-resolution techniques to assess photoreceptor structure. The Advanced Ocular Imaging Program has made significant advances on this front ? advancing innovative adaptive-optics (AO) imaging instrumentation for probing photoreceptor inner- and outer-segment structure with single-cell resolution, creating software for extracting quantitative metrics of the photoreceptor mosaic, and developing tools for making accurate and reliable measurements of photoreceptor structure from optical coherence tomography (OCT) images of the retina. From a clinical perspective, these tools are in relative infancy, thus we propose to help accelerate their translation through the following specific aims: 1) Define the variability in the remnant cone population in human patients with achromatopsia (ACHM), 2) Characterize the integrity of the photoreceptor mosaic in individuals with L/M opsin mutations, and 3) Elucidate the rod/cone contribution to the photoreceptor layers in OCT images. The specific diseases being studied have a wide range of rod/cone involvement, are current or emerging targets for treatment efforts, and continue to represent a major strength of our multidisciplinary research team. This work is expected to have a significant positive impact, with the high-resolution genotype-phenotype relationships identified here providing a better understanding of the therapeutic potential in patients with inherited retinal degenerations as well as producing validated tools for assessing photoreceptor structure in emerging clinical trials. Our proposal addresses two emerging needs identified in the NEI Publication ?Vision Research: Needs, Gaps, and Opportunities?: ?Characterize the macula and perifoveal regions of the retina to better understand the predilection of the macula for disease,? and ?Translate high-resolution retinal imaging technologies, like adaptive optics, into cost-effective and easy-to-use platforms for routine clinical use.?"
"9359985","Project Summary This project aims to study and better define a potential biological pathway which multiple pieces of evidence have suggested plays a role in behavioral responses to ethanol. This pathway is centered around N-myc downstream-regulated gene 1 (NDGR1), whose expression in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) has been linked the acute ethanol sensitivity phenotype, loss of righting reflex (LORR) duration. Mutations in NDRG1 in humans are the cause of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 4D (CMT4D), a disease that severely affects peripheral myelination by inhibiting the function of Schwann Cells. In the CNS, NDRG1 expression has been shown to be a key network regulator of multiple myelin-related genes in the PFC, particularly in the presence of ethanol. Multiple studies have found that NDRG1 expression levels and sub-cellular localization varies substantially between cell-types throughout the body. Additionally, there is a large amount of evidence to suggest that phosphorylation of the protein alters its physiological function within the cell. Using a time course and dose response study, we will investigate the regulation of NDRG1 by ethanol and ethanol?s effects on the level of mRNA expression, protein abundance, protein phosphorylation, and protein localization within oligodendrocytes and pyramidal neurons of the PFC of mice after acute doses of ethanol and after a voluntary consumption drinking study. Additionally, we will develop, validate, and use viral vectors for cell-type specific overexpression NDRG1 in either oligodendrocytes or neurons within the PFC of mice. We will then study the effect of overexpression of this transcript on LORR duration and ethanol consumption and preference by providing voluntary ethanol access via an intermittent access drinking model. Finally, we will investigate the effect of overexpression of this transcript on basal myelin-related gene expression within the PFC and the overall transcriptome of the PFC."
"9446574","OVERALL ABSTRACT The lethal stage of metastatic prostate cancer, called castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), kills ~26,000 men per year in the US. Despite remarkable improvements in survival with next generation AR pathway inhibitors such as abiraterone and enzalutamide, CRPC patients ultimately progress and die from their disease. Our understanding of the mechanisms of acquired resistance to AR therapy has increased dramatically in recent years, largely based on genomic landscape analyses of tumors from CRPC patients and preclinical studies of acquired resistance in patient-derived models (organoids, PDX). Much of this progress is directly linked to the members of this Drug Resistance and Sensitivity Center (DRSC) team. A major mechanistic insight from these studies is the recognition of two categories of AR therapy resistance: one in which AR pathway signaling is restored and the other in which it remains inhibited. Underlying both categories are a heterogeneous set of resistance mechanisms, many of which were discovered by our DRSC team members. Importantly, we have shown that several of these resistance mechanisms can be targeted with current clinical grade drugs. The overarching goal of this DRSC proposal is to evaluate these translational opportunities across a unique set of preclinical organoid and PDX models (again, discovered and developed by our DRSC team members) and to catalyze the initiation of clinical studies in patients most likely to benefit based on appropriate biomarker profiles. We address this goal in three Projects. Project 1 focuses on resistance caused by restored AR pathway function, which occurs in over ~50% of CRPC patients, by targeting the glucocorticoid receptor, which is upregulated and substitutes for AR, or by further inhibition of AR signaling using drugs targeting specific components of the chromatin machinery. Project 2 will take a similar approach but will focus on the opposite category of acquired resistance (absence of restored AR pathway activity), leveraging insights from our recent data showing that cancer can revert from an AR-negative to AR-positive state by targeting specific chromatin modifiers. Project 3 integrates with Projects 1 and 2 by focusing on kinase inhibitors as an adjunct to AR pathway therapy in two distinct contexts ? PI3K/AKT activation in tumors with PTEN loss and FGFR activation in tumors with autocrine FGF8/FGF9 production. Excitingly, a recent clinical trial of combined AKT and AR inhibition, which was initiated based on our earlier work, demonstrated a significant improvement in survival for patients with PTEN loss prostate cancer. The Administrative Core will oversee the integration of the Projects with each other, with NCI scientific staff and with other DRSCs. Collectively our studies will validate various combination therapy regimens, in conjunction with molecular biomarkers for patient selection, as a critical step toward clinical translation. In addition, the drugs and targets studied here are broadly relevant for multiple cancer types."
"9442583","Sharp wave ripples (SPW-Rs) are self-organized, synchronized population events in which hippocampal circuit excitability is markedly and transiently enhanced. The temporal distribution of SPW-Rs is highly irregular and strongly influenced by behavioral and brain states, indicating the existence of control mechanisms for the initiation of these population events and the memory replay which they support. There is accumulating evidence that suggests that SPW-Rs occurrence is controlled by both extra-hippocampal and intra-hippocampal influences. However, the precise distal and local circuit mechanisms by which these extra- and intra-hippocampal influences control SPW-R initiation are unknown. In Project 1, we will perform a comprehensive set of studies which will provide new information on the precise temporal relationship (through observational experiments using integrated high-resolution methods) and perturbational influence (using optogenetic interventions) of key suspected extra- and intra-hippocampal controllers of SPW-R initiation."
"9327667","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): High deductible health plans (HDHPs) have lower premiums, but require patients to pay the full cost of most medical care until annual deductibles of $1000 to $6000 are met. HDHPs have proliferated rapidly over the last decade. Health Savings Account (HSA)-qualified HDHPs are the most rapidly growing HDHP arrangement, now covering 14% of commercially insured Americans. These plans subject most health care services (including medications) to high annual deductibles but allow pre-tax contributions to accounts that can be used for medical costs. Advocates believe that exposing patients to greater costs will create activated consumers who will seek higher-value health care and adopt healthy behaviors, while critics fear that these economic barriers may reduce access to needed care. Our ongoing project in the Natural Experiments in Diabetes Translation (NEXT-D) initiative (5U58DP002719) has determined that diabetes patients with HSA-HDHPs experience the largest reductions in hospital access and adherence to key medications for chronic illness. Although these findings are concerning, federal regulations allow employers to tailor HSA-HDHPs through two mechanisms that could improve access to care: (1) Exempting certain chronic medications from deductible requirements (i.e., medications cost $0 to patients) through preventive drug lists ($0-PDs), and (2) Generously funding HSAs so that employees pay less out-of-pocket. Thus, HSA-HDHPs represent both a risk to diabetes patients but also an opportunity for employers to improve care through tailored cost sharing reductions. In this application, we will examine effects of these two important variations in HDHP design on diabetes secondary prevention, high priority care, diabetes complications, and costs, both overall and among vulnerable subgroups (men, low socioeconomic status, Black or Hispanic, severe diabetes, high comorbidity). We will employ a cutting-edge interrupted time series study design that approximates the estimates of randomized controlled trials. We will draw from a 12-year rolling cohort (2005-2017) of >60 million members insured by a large national health plan, with 30,000 diabetes patients who experience employer-mandated transitions to HSA-HDHPs. We will also conduct economic analyses from the employer and member perspectives of the impacts of $0-PDs and generously funded HSAs on total health care and out-of-pocket costs. Our findings will allow policy makers and employers to develop tailored, next-generation health insurance designs that optimize quality and equity for diabetes patients who are most vulnerable under HDHPs."
"9469310","Project Summary Frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) encompasses a group of neurodegenerative disorders characterized by cognitive and behavioral impairments. Heterozygous mutations in progranulin (PGRN) result in decreased PGRN expression and account for ~25% of familial FTLD. In contrast, homozygous PGRN mutations result in complete loss of PGRN and lead to neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (NCL), a group of neurodegenerative lysosomal storage disorders. Thus, PGRN mutations appear to cause different diseases (FTLD vs NCL) in a dose-dependent manner, suggesting that heterozygous PGRN mutations might cause FTLD via partial loss of lysosomal function. My PhD Dissertation Project aims to determine if reduced PGRN expression, due to FTLD-linked PGRN heterozygous mutations, causes lysosomal dysfunction and contributes to neurodegeneration in FTLD. Using iPSC-derived human cortical neurons derived from FTLD patients harboring PGRN mutations compared to isogenic controls, we have demonstrated that PGRN mutant neurons have significantly impaired lysosomal proteolysis. To determine the mechanism of this impaired lysosomal proteolysis, we examined the relationship between PGRN and the lysosomal enzyme cathepsin D. Mutations in PGRN and CTSD both lead to similar forms of NCL, and cathepsin D is predominantly expressed in the brain where it is responsible for the degradation of long-lived proteins. We found that cathepsin D activity, but not its expression was significantly decreased in PGRN mutant neurons. Furthermore, we demonstrated that PGRN interacts with cathepsin D, and that granulins, cleavage products of PGRN, significantly increase cathepsin D activity in vitro. Based upon these initial results, we propose a novel role for PGRN in regulating lysosomal cathepsin D activity, which is disrupted by loss of PGRN expression in FTLD-linked heterozygous mutant neurons, leading to defective lysosomal function in FTLD. To further investigate these results, we will perform in vitro dose-dependent cathepsin D activity curves using recombinant granulins to determine if individual granulins cleaved from PGRN specifically regulate cathepsin D activity. Furthermore, we will determine if PGRN interacts with or alters the activity of other lysosomal enzymes in addition to cathepsin D. Finally, we will use long-term cultures of FTLD patient-derived PGRN mutant iPSC cortical neurons to determine if lysosomal dysfunction resulting from decreased cathepsin D activity contributes to pathogenic FTLD hallmarks such as ubiquitin and TDP-43 positive inclusion formation. This PhD Dissertation Project will provide important insight into both the normal role of PGRN in regulating lysosomal function and the cellular mechanisms by which PGRN mutations cause FTLD in human neurons. As a Postdoctoral trainee, I will expand upon my PhD training by studying how glial cells contribute to neurodegenerative phenotypes. Ultimately, I plan to merge my PhD and postdoctoral training by becoming an academic researcher investigating the role of neuronal-glial interactions in the pathogenesis of neurodegeneration."
"9552420","Project Summary Capsaicin- and heat-activated TRPV1 ion channel is a primary nociceptor for both chemical and thermal stimuli, hence an attractive target for pain medication. Despite the availability of cryo-EM structures of TRPV1 at up-to-2.9 Å resolutions, molecular mechanisms underlying TRPV1 activation remains unclear. A major limitation for obtaining mechanistic information from the cryo-EM structures is the general lack of resolution to determine side-chain orientation and the associated atomic interaction. We recently demonstrated that the limitation could be overcome by combining Rosetta structural prediction with site-specific functional tests such as thermodynamic mutant cycle analysis that serve to constrain, validate, and improve structure prediction. Using this iterative approach, in combination with molecular dynamics (MD) simulation and site-specific fluorescence recordings including FRET and patch fluorometry, our proposed study aims to identify functional interactions in the capsaicin-binding domain and the outer pore and, more importantly, to reveal dynamic changes of these interactions during capsaicin- and heat-induced activation. We will take particular advantage of our newly designed fluorescent capsaicin analogs that allow us to directly monitor ligand binding, as well as the fluorescent unnatural amino acid (FUAA) incorporation method to introduce a small fluorophore to the channel's moving parts. Our goal is to elucidate key molecular interactions that mediate chemical and thermal activation, thus providing a molecular framework to guide pharmaceutical intervention."
"9360773","DESCRIPTION     The objective of this project is to develop a tissue-engineered construct including an engineered nucleus pulposus and annulus fibrosus to treat defects of the annulus fibrosus (AF) and degenerative changes of the intervertebral disc (IVD). Three Specific Aims are pursued:  Specific Aim 1 will consist of establishing in vitro tissue engineered NP fabrication from rabbit and  human NP and MSC cells in hyaluronic acid (HA)-based hydrogel constructs, and evaluation of cell  viability, gene regulation, ECM production, and biomechanical properties as a function of gel  biophysical properties, cell seeding density, and extended culture in a disc-like environment.  Specific Aim 2 will entail establishing and evaluating cellular infiltration and functional maturation  engineered AF-like structures starting from rabbit and human AF and MSC seeded nanofibrous  scaffolds in vitro.  Specific Aim 3 will combine the tissue-engineered NP and AF developed in Aims 1 and 2 to form a  composite disc-like construct, and to then apply this construct to an in vivo rabbit disc model of total  discectomy. Efficacy will be assesse via MRI T2 mapping and subsequent ex vivo analysis of motion  segment mechanical, biochemical, and histologic properties. Research Design: This study will utilize in vitro tissue culture for Specific Aims 1-2; Specific Aim 3 will utilize a rabbit animal model and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Methodology: Specific Aims 1 and 2 are laboratory-based studies that will utilize in vitro tissue culture. Specific Aim 3 will be performed in vivo with a rabbit mdel for discectomy and tissue-engineered disc implantation with subsequent ex vivo MRI of the spine and tissue analysis. The primary study outcome measures for Specific Aims 1-3 are biochemical analysis of tissue culture and biomechanical analysis of tissue-engineered constructs. Additionally, Specific Aim 3 will utilize these same outcomes, as well as implement quantitative MRI T2 maps of the implanted tissue-engineered constructs with comparisons made to control (non-treated discectomy) and adjacent normal discs. Findings: n/a at this time. Clinical Relationships: The goal of this project is to develop tissue-engineered constructs to trea degenerative disc disease as well as to validate radiologic methods to noninvasively assess potential therapeutic treatments of degenerative disc disease. Impact/Significance: It is anticipated that the proposed study will offer an increased understanding of degenerative disc disease and potential novel therapeutic treatment to both reverse degenerative changes as well as decrease risk of recurrent disc herniation. Further, it will provide critical support for the applicant as he develops a research-intensive clinical practice in spine surgery at the Philadelphia VA Medical Center and the University of Pennsylvania."
"9327824","PROJECT SUMMARY Placenta accreta is a disease of pregnancy in which the placenta invades too deeply into maternal tissue. This morbid adherence typically leads to a host of complications, including pre-term birth, hysterectomy, damage to surrounding organs, and even maternal death. Despite a sharp rise in disease incidence over the last 50-100 years, the underlying causes of accreta are unknown. The prevailing model of accreta pathogenesis is that sites of prior uterine damage sustained through procedures such as C-section are vulnerable to excessively deep implantation of the placenta. However, recent results from both my lab and other groups have suggested that placental cells themselves (trophoblasts) are also defective in accreta. In our preliminary transcriptomic analysis of accreta placental tissues, the first large-scale molecular characterization of this disease, I demonstrated that nearly all genes overexpressed in accreta are normally specifically expressed in extravillous trophoblasts (EVTs), the subpopulation of trophoblasts responsible for the placenta?s invasive capacities. Furthermore, initial microscopic analysis revealed an increased population of invasive EVTs at the expense of non-invasive, progenitor trophoblasts. Therefore, the goal of my proposed research is to investigate the role of trophoblast dysregulation in accreta at the molecular and cellular levels and functionally elucidate critical factors that endow disease trophoblasts with the ability to overinvade. First, I will perform a series of immunofluorescence experiments to further examine EVT expression patterns and cell fate changes in accreta. Second, I will perform targeted sequencing of trophoblasts from both an active site of overinvasion in accreta and from a site with no abnormal invasion. This will determine whether additional trophoblast molecules are responsible for hyperinvasive events at sites of accreta. Using a well-established in vitro assay, I will then functionally test whether these molecules are sufficient to drive invasion. Lastly, I will develop an animal model of accreta to investigate in vivo determinants of placental overinvasion to establish mechanisms of accreta disease pathogenesis and progression. Overall, the results from this proposal will reveal unprecedented mechanistic insights in accreta, which will be essential for future development of new and effective diagnostic and therapeutic strategies."
"9449111","7. Project Summary/Abstract The development of both tolerance and autoimmunity is dependent on the presentation of self-antigens in the thymus and periphery. Thymic tolerance requires recognition of self-antigens leading to negative selection, i.e. deletion of self-reactive T cell clones; or selection into Foxp3+ regulatory T (Treg) cells, important for maintaining immune homeostasis in the periphery. In the periphery, presentation of self-antigens results in maintenance and induction of regulatory T cells to promote tolerance, but can also facilitate autoimmunity via induction of self-reactive effector cells. These processes are driven by antigen presenting cells (APCs), of which there are several subsets. Previously, we showed that Batf3-dependent CD8?+ DCs play an important role in thymic tolerance as the major recipient of antigen transfer from medullary thymic epithelial cells (mTECs), which produce a variety of self-antigens via the effect of the transcription factor Aire. Here, we propose to continue our studies on the role of CD8?+ DCs in tolerance and autoimmunity. We will continue our ongoing studies of thymic CD8?+ DCs with the goal of understanding the mechanisms of antigen transfer (Aim 1). We will also ask whether CD8?+ DCs present a unique array of self-antigens in the periphery with the goal of identifying the origin of some of these antigens (Aim 2). Finally, we will determine whether peripheral CD8?+ DCs are involved in effector vs regulatory T cell differentiation in response to self-antigens (Aim 3). If successful, this grant will offer new insights regarding the role of CD8?+ DCs in providing antigen-specific and T cell developmental niches in the thymus and periphery that may control the balance between tolerance and autoimmunity."
"9449147","The primary mission of goal of the Pre-medical Cancer Immunotherapy Network for Canine Trials (PRECINCT) is to facilitate the performance of immunotherapy clinical trials in dogs with cancer and to expedite the identification of immunological correlates of successful therapeutic responses. The PRECINCT will achieve these goal by supporting a highly coordinated clinical trials network of participating U01 sites. As a coordinating center, the PRECINCT will work in consultation with U01 investigators, the Steering Committee, representatives from the Comparative Oncology Program (COP) at NCI and an External Advisory Committee to provide expert services in project management and research technology, data management, biostatistical support and immunological monitoring. Specifically, we will establish a PRECINCT Data Coordinating Center to provide comprehensive project oversight, supervise all project management and regulatory compliance activities, and coordinate site management for all aspects of single and large multi-site projects. Through the PRECINCT, U01 investigators will have ready access to research services and standardized protocols that will facilitate the performance of clinical research across the PRECINCT. We will establish a PRECINCT Data Management System to collect, store and share all clinical and correlative data amongst the U01 sites and with the COP directors and Steering Committee. We will develop the infrastructure necessary to achieve an efficient, highly functioning coordinated network and develop standard operating procedures (SOPs) that can be applied across all PRECINCT-associated U01 projects to ensure high quality, repeatable data sets. We will provide biostatistical support for study design and data analysis to ensure that immunotherapy clinical trials performed within the network are strategically designed and appropriately powered to achieve meaningful clinical and laboratory data results in the most expedite way. The renowned expertise of the University of Pennsylvania in both human and canine clinical trials will foster rapid translation of state-of-the art methods for human clinical study design and analysis to canine clinical trials and results from canine trials can rapidly inform human clinical trials, thus optimizing results for both species. Finally, the University of Pennsylvania is a leader in cancer immunotherapy and is also home to world renowned experts in immune reagent development and immunological monitoring. We will leverage this expertise to both accelerate the mission of the U24 and extend it by providing support for immunologic reagent development for use in correlative studies and biomarker identification. In concert with U01 investigators, the COP and the Steering Committee, we will design, generate and validate several multiparametric, multicolor flow panels and SOPs for their use across the U01 sites. Successful immunologic monitoring will allow canine cancer patients to be streamlined to single or combination therapies most likely to be effective and will provide essential insight for future translational application to human cancer patients."
"9446064","Abstract The objective of this project is to develop effective precision medicine for treatment of KRAS-mutant non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) by determining responses of molecularly characterized patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models with or without KRAS mutations to targeted therapeutic agents. The priority will be given to the agents in the NCI Investigational New Drugs (NCI-IND agents) portfolio to increase the success of early-phase clinical trials in patients with KRAS-mutant NSCLCs. The central hypothesis of the proposed study is that a large set of well-characterized KRAS-mutant NSCLC PDXs that recapitulate multiple characteristics of the biological context of human KRAS-mutant cancers will provide a preclinical platform for identifying effective therapeutic strategies for KRAS-mutant NSCLC and molecular biomarkers capable of identifying treatment responders. Activating mutations of the KRAS gene are known to be among the major genomic alterations associated with lung adenocarcinoma. Thus far, treatment of KRAS-mutant NSCLC remains an unmet medical need. Moreover, development of active anticancer drugs is challenged by high failure rates caused by a lack of preclinical tumor models highly predictive of therapeutic effects in humans and of biomarkers that identify responders in clinical trials. We will overcome this challenge by determining the therapeutic activities of targeted drugs and identifying potential predictive biomarkers capable of identifying responders to those agents in clinically and molecularly annotated PDX models derived from NSCLC. Our research team has extensive expertise in establishing NSCLC PDXs, molecularly characterizing PDXs and primary tumors, developing novel therapeutic strategies for NSCLC, and translating effective preclinical therapeutic strategies for clinical trials. We have generated 190 NSCLC PDXs and completed genomic characterization of 82 PDXs (22% with oncogenic KRAS mutations) and their respective primary tumors. Together, our team is positioned to make a major contribution to the overall objectives of the NCI's PDXNet to generate data on PDX models to support early clinical trials of precision therapies. To that end, we propose three specific aims: 1) determine molecular subtypes of NSCLC PDXs with KRAS mutations; 2) determine responses of NSCLC PDX models with or without KRAS mutations to treatment with investigational new drugs approved for patient use, with priority given to the NCI-IND agents; and 3) characterize molecular biomarkers and the mechanistic relationship between molecular subtypes and treatment responses. The proposed studies are highly relevant to the following Research Areas of NCI's PDX Development and Trial Centers: 1) mechanism-based drug combinations in treatment of genetically defined tumor subgroups that explore the correlation of genetic abnormalities with tumor response; and 2) mechanisms that contribute to the sensitivity or resistance of PDX models to therapeutic agents. The success of the proposed studies will lead to effective precision therapy for KRAS-mutant lung cancers, for which current therapies are ineffective.  "
"9176804","Project Summary/Abstract   The University of Connecticut Study on Aging, Musculoskeletal Disorders and Work Capacity (UConn-SAM) is based on the premise that preventive workplace actions can sustain active working life and deter premature incapacity. It supplements and extends a 6-year longitudinal study (R01OH008929) that has enlisted more than 1000 aging workforce participants in 6 manufacturing companies. The current work has uncovered large and ominous recent trends that document heightened workforce stress, and delayed retirement. The extent of eldercare responsibilities and its adverse impacts on health and ability to meet the physical demands of work were previously unreported findings. The unanswered questions that this current proposal addresses involve more precise clarification of critical findings and setting the groundwork for intervention studies that would enable workplaces to be more compatible with an aging workforce and to better align social agencies and available services with workforce needs. This proposal has several long-term goals which will be accomplished over three years: 1. Re-evaluate the study population from 2016-2018 to further characterize the trajectory of associations  between work and non-work exposures and health effects as our cohort ages. 2. Finalize and validate the best survey and physical testing regimens for long-term assessment of an aging  workforce within the work environment. 3. Develop and pilot feasible workplace interventions by performing direct observations, focus groups and  specialized assessments that define factors supporting healthy workforce aging.   The last of these goals would involve assessing the feasibility of workplace design and organizational change and working with the Area Agency on Aging to develop new and more effective approaches to elder care. Intervention studies are often inconclusive because the actual behavior, volatility of interests, and workplace flexibility are never adequately known a priori, even when there is available pilot data. By using participatory methods that engage workers, managers, and agency representatives, coupled with surveys, we expect to significantly improve the likelihood of success in intervention projects for ourselves and other investigators."
"9350737","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Sudden cardiac death (SCD) from ventricular arrhythmias remains the leading cause of death in developed nations, and is rapidly increasing in the rest of the world. The link between efferent sympathetic signaling and SCD has been recognized for a century; however, neuro-modulatory strategies to mitigate SCD have largely been limited. Diversity of neurotransmitters released in the heart, structural and functional remodeling of neurons within the cardiac neuraxis, and alterations in neural information processing are typically not factored in, and remain controversial. Following cardiac injury, widespread structural and neurochemical alterations occur in peripheral ganglia mediating cardiac afferent and efferent neurotransmission, yet, the functional consequences of such changes on intra- and inter-ganglionic signal processing are not understood. In addition, the dynamic nature of the cardiac electrophysiologic substrate is not considered, as changes in efferent sympathetic tone can dramatically alter the cardiac electrophysiologic properties even in scarred hearts. Utilizing multimodal approaches, we will test the hypothesis that the peripheral neural circuitry of SCD can be resolved, and related to cardiac electrophysiological behavior. This idea will be tackled in humans and animal models of ischemic cardiomyopathy and SCD. We will determine molecular, structural, and neurochemical alterations occurring in stellate ganglia, and how they occur. Intra- and inter-ganglionic neural processing by remodeled neurons will be assessed by neuronal recordings using high-throughput, high-density novel arrays, with simultaneous high-density cardiac electrophysiologic mapping. Efferent responses to afferent loads will be examined by detailed mapping of cardiac electrophysiologic and contractile function, and from bioelectric sensors in the myocardial interstitium to determine patterns of classical and non-classical neurotransmitter release. Finally, the arrhythmogenicity of altered processing will be examined in 2D and 3D models of cardiac tissue. If successful, this study will elucidate the neural signature of arrhythmic risk/SCD. The ability to monitor neural signatures and resolve the temporal risk of SCD answers a longstanding question in arrhythmia biology, with significant implications for discovering key therapies that are low cost and be utilized globally."
"9565012","PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Among individuals with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, effective antiretroviral therapy (ART) has resulted in a marked increase in survival, so that about half of people living with HIV (PLWH) in the US are now 50 years of age or older. Cardiovascular diseases are common among aging PLWH, often at much higher rates than in the general population. This is likely due to a complex interplay of HIV infection and resulting inflammation, ART and its toxicities, viral co-infections, other co-morbid conditions, traditional risk factors, and other behaviors such as substance abuse. Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a common cardiac arrhythmia, strongly associated with aging, that confers substantially elevated risks of stroke, more rapid cognitive decline, dementia, and heart failure in the general population. The pathogenesis of AF involves inflammation, fibrosis, and atrial remodeling. The chronic inflammation associated with HIV infection may contribute to early onset of the arrhythmia in PLWH. Therapeutic advances that reduce chronic inflammation, such as effective ART, may reduce AF. Yet little is known about AF in PLWH. The proposed project will determine the incidence of AF, rigorously assess its risk factors, and determine the risk of AF complications in PLWH. Understanding the contribution of multiple factors to the increased risk of AF is crucial to developing strategies to improve AF prevention, diagnosis, and treatment in PLWH. This application leverages comprehensive clinical data from the Centers for AIDS Research Network of Integrated Clinical Systems (CNICS), a well-established dynamic cohort of over 32,000 PLWH receiving clinical care. Data on AF in uninfected individuals will come from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA), in which AF is already ascertained using validated methods in an ongoing fashion. The large, diverse CNICS cohort captures longitudinal clinical data and patient-reported outcomes, facilitating a detailed approach to addressing risk in PLWH. In addition, CNICS infrastructure allows AF outcomes to be identified and carefully validated by review of original medical records, permitting us to identify acute conditions that predispose to AF. The multidisciplinary research team for this project is uniquely poised to address important gaps in understanding the pathophysiology, diagnosis, treatment, and impact of AF in relation to HIV infection by pursuing four aims. Aim 1 is to determine the age, sex-, and race-specific incidence of AF in PLWH. Aim 2 is to identify patient characteristics associated with AF in PLWH, including precipitants such as sepsis, drug intoxication, and intrathoracic disease. Aim 3 is to evaluate an existing AF risk model and to develop and test new risk models for AF prediction in PLWH. Finally, Aim 4 is to examine outcomes in PLWH following clinical recognition of AF. New knowledge gained from these investigations will inform clinical decision-making and will improve understanding of the mechanisms of AF, which will enhance the development of rational and targeted therapeutic approaches to improve outcomes."
"9484405","Compared to Whites, Blacks carry a disproportionate burden of chronic disease and early mortality. These health disparities have been linked with high levels of psychosocial stress experienced by Blacks (e.g., poverty, interpersonal violence), but the biological mechanisms linking psychosocial stress with health disparities remain poorly understood. Similarly, the extent to which multi-level protective factors (e.g., from individual, interpersonal, and community domains) mitigate the effects of early life stress on health outcomes and underlying biological mechanisms is unknown. This proposal will investigate the hypothesis that early life stress (before age 20) produces DNA methylation profiles that contribute to health disparities in obesity-related outcomes and are transmitted across generations, but can be mitigated by protective factors from individual, interpersonal, and community domains. To achieve the goals of this project, we will capitalize on an existing longitudinal study, the Birmingham Youth Violence Study, which collected prospective, multi-informant data on a variety of early life stressors and protective factors in over 500 individuals (78% Black, 22% White, 50% female) in Birmingham, Alabama, longitudinally at average ages 11, 13 and 19. This project will conduct a follow up assessment on 400 young adults from this cohort (average age 26) and 200 of their offspring (ages 0 to 5). It will involve a comprehensive evaluation of obesity and related biomarkers (blood pressure, glycated hemoglobin, inflammation markers) in the young adults; assessment of obesity and history of early life stress in the offspring; and collection and analyses of salivary DNA from both the young adults and their offspring. The combined data will be used to 1) identify DNA methylation variations that are associated with early life stress and obesity in young adulthood; 2) identify multi-level protective factors that attenuate the associations of early life stress with DNA methylation and obesity; and 3) characterize the extent to which stress-related DNA methylation patterns transmit across generations and contribute to offspring obesity. The findings of this study will provide novel insights into stress-related epigenetic mechanisms that may explain racial health disparities and their transmission across generations, as well as multi-level protective factors that may interrupt the perpetuation of biologically embedded adversity across generations. Better understanding of these processes may lead to development of epigenetic biomarkers for early diagnosis of disease, ability to identify susceptible individuals at risk for adult disease, and development of novel preventive and curative measures that would reduce health disparities."
"9235011","Project Summary Uveitis accounts for as much acquired visual loss as diabetes or macular degeneration. Although many entities cause uveitis, the most frequent diagnosis is ?idiopathic?, a description that frustrates patients and physicians. We have shown that some systemic diseases associated with uveitis demonstrate distinct gene expression profiles that can be identified in blood. We propose to characterize the gene expression profile for 4 important causes of uveitis: sarcoidosis, ankylosing spondylitis, inflammatory bowel disease, and tubulointerstitial nephritis with uveitis. Our study will determine if the profiles for each disease have adequate sensitivity and specificity to become diagnostic tools. We will test the hypothesis that many diseases that cause uveitis share expression of common RNA transcripts. We will segregate subjects with idiopathic uveitis on the basis of gene expression and validate this classification by determining if the clinical phenotype of the uveitis fits with the gene expression profile. By studying subjects longitudinally over the course of the proposal, we will distinguish transcripts that are indicative of the disease phenotype in contrast to transcripts that are indicative of the disease activity. The proposed studies represent a potential paradigm shift in the approach to uveitis and a prime example of the application of precision medicine to a clinical conundrum."
"9568080","Autoimmunity is caused by conspiring effects of genetic predisposition and environmental factors such as injury, infection and microbiome constitution. While multiple genetic loci affect susceptibility, in most cases each in isolation has only a small effect, suggesting that disease develops only when multiple risk-conferring alleles that function in concert are inherited by a single individual. We hypothesize that such a situation exists in autoreactive B cells where multiple SLE risk alleles encode molecules that appear to function in signaling pathways that function normally to limit/terminate antigen receptor signaling. In this application we propose to test this hypothesis, analyzing the functional interplay of this set of genes/protein and their risk conferring alleles. Future development and implementation of ?precision? medical approaches for treatment of autoimmunity will require an understanding of the mechanisms by which genetic variations conspire to increase disease risk, and research proposed here represents a critical first step to enable these efforts. A number of autoimmunity risk alleles encode molecules previously proposed to function as intermediaries in signaling pathways involved in regulation of B cell activation. As such they may be important in keeping autoreactive B cells from becoming activated and contributing to autoimmunity. In this application we request support to define the functions and functional interactions of proteins encoded by six genes, variants of which confer increased risk of autoimmunity. Previous reports indicate that B cell-targeted deletion of genes encoding SHIP-1, PTEN, SHP-1 or LYN, expression of PTPN22 (PEP-R619W), or increased expression of CSK, promote the development of autoimmunity. However the mechanism by which this occurs is unknown. We hypothesize that these proteins function as intermediaries in a bifurcating pathway in which final effectors are the inositol lipid phosphatases SHIP-1 and the tyrosine phosphatase SHP-1. Further, we suggest that both terminal effectors are required for maintenance of antigen unresponsiveness of anergic B cells. The studies will employ reductionist genetic models in which risk allele mimetic changes in expression/function of the proteins can be induced acutely in anergic B cells, and subsequent cell activation, proliferation, differentiation and autoantibody production monitored. Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that PTPN22, CSK and LYN act in linear pathways upstream of SHIP-1 and SHP-1, and that genetic variations that confer risk compromise anergy by undermining their regulatory function. Aim 2 will define the downstream consequences of acute introduction of risk allele mimetic conditions in terms of development of autoimmune disease, and will test candidate therapeutic kinase inhibitors. Aim 3 will translate findings, examining the role of SHIP-1 and SHP-1 phosphatases in maintenance anergy of human B cells. Proposed studies will provide important new insight regarding the in vivo lifestyle of autoreactive B cells whose anergy is compromised by autoimmunity risk alleles."
"9516109","7. PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The overall goal of this research project is to develop a vascularized full thickness skin substitute, engraftment of which can provide a definitive clinical cure of chronic cutaneous ulcers, an unmet medical need. This application is a competitive Revision to add a specific aim to a funded R01 grant (HL-085416 ?Optimizing Therapeutic Revascularization by Endothelial Cell Transplantation?) submitted in response to RFA-HL-17-029 (Revision Applications for Regenerative Medicine Innovation Projects). The parent R01 grant is focused on establishing perfusion of tissue engineered grafts through the self-assembly of incorporated human endothelial cells (EC) into microvessels. We have found that the best source of EC for this purpose is the differentiated progeny of human endothelial colony forming cells (HECFC), an ?adult? stem cell type isolated from neonatal cord or adult peripheral blood as defined by the terms of this RFA. Over the past six months, Drs. W. Mark Saltzman and Jordan S. Pober, co-PIs of the parent grant, have established a collaboration with Dr. Pankaj Karande to apply their approach for microvessel generation to his approach for 3D printing to create a full thickness human skin substitute. Current FDA-approved skin substitutes have all had only limited clinical success because they fail to vascularize, and consequently slough over the course of a few weeks. The vascularized skin substitute produced through this collaboration can potentially address this problem. However, the skin substitutes that we have generated to date employ bio-inks containing human cells that have been cultured in fetal bovine serum and use extracellular matrix molecules derived from animal sources. Similar exposures to animal proteins used in the production of currently approved skin substitutes have further limited their approved use. The goal of our new specific aim is to develop a vascularized full thickness human skin substitute through 3D printing made with bio-inks that are composed of human cells that have not been exposed to animal proteins and extracellular matrix molecules that are either derived from human tissues or made by recombinant approaches that do not involve exposure to animal proteins. Subaims a and b describe our approaches to achieve this. Subaim c will involve evaluation of perfusion of the resultant 3D bioprinted skin graft compared to natural skin and to Apligraf, a currently approved full thickness skin substitute, after engraftment on immunodeficient mouse hosts. The development of methods for creating a fully humanized and vascularized full thickness skin equivalent will provide the information needed to develop Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) conditions for preparing clinical grade skin substitutes."
"9569974","ABSTRACT The Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center (SKCCC) at Johns Hopkins is dedicated to cancer research, education and training, and care, with an overarching goal of expeditiously and strategically applying new knowledge to improve prevention, screening, detection, diagnosis and treatment of cancer in Maryland and throughout nation and the world. Through targeted outreach and research, cancer outcomes disparities are decreasing in SKCCC's catchment area, but they remain a challenge and a focus at SKCCC. This application requests continued Cancer Center Support Grant (CCSG) funding for SKCCC's Research Programs and Cores. The SKCCC comprises a multidisciplinary, interdepartmental center of The Johns Hopkins University (JHU), encompassing 34 departments in five schools. The scientific Programs of the SKCCC organize and orient the broad base of cancer research throughout JHU into teams focused on rapid translation to the clinic and to populations inside and outside its catchment area. Research conducted at SKCCC includes discovery research into the molecular genetics of human tumorigenesis, clinical trials of new cancer treatments and epidemiologic analyses of lifestyle influences on cancer mortality. The SKCCC is a leading cancer center that is providing insights into the fundamental nature of different cancers and elucidating the thousands of somatic genetic and epigenetic alterations that mark the differences from case to case. This body of work has fueled an emerging understanding that the ultimate control of cancer will require individualizing cancer care using approaches that can be deployed at a population scale. To accomplish this mission, SKCCC took critical input from its External Advisory Board and has strategically evolved since the last CCSG to: 1) augment the clinical and population impact of the discovery pipeline in cancer genetics, epigenetics and immunology generated by discipline-oriented Programs; 2) maximize the translational research output of disease-specific Programs, emphasizing the exploration of new concepts in scientifically driven clinical trials; and 3) position the population-oriented Program to identify, understand and overcome barriers responsible for disparities in cancer outcome in the catchment area. The nine SKCCC Research Programs include four discipline-oriented Programs: Cancer Biology (CB; Baylin, Velculescu), Cancer Immunology (CI; Pardoll, Drake), Cancer Molecular and Functional Imaging (CMFI; Bhujwalla, Pomper), and Cancer Chemical and Structural Biology (CCSB; Berger, Liu); four disease- specific Programs: Hematologic Malignancies and Bone Marrow Transplantation (HMBMT; Ambinder, Jones, Levis), Prostate Cancer (PC; Pienta, Denmeade, Lupold), Breast and Ovarian Cancer (BOC; Stearns, Shih), and Brain Cancer (BC; Grossman, Brem, Laterra); and one population-oriented Program: Cancer Prevention and Control (CPC; Platz, Roden). These Programs are supported by fifteen Cores, one developing Core (described in Developmental Funds) and a dedicated leadership team."
"9360774","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Background: Schizophrenia is a disabling illness, characterized by severe impairments in social, occupational, and community function. There is also ample evidence of significant cognitive impairments in schizophrenia, and these cognitive impairments directly relate to poorer functional outcomes. An increasing number of reviews and meta-analyses provide support for the efficacy of cognitive rehabilitation in schizophrenia, and cognitive rehabilitation services ar proliferating across the nation. In individuals with schizophrenia, the (real-world) effectiveness f this and other psychosocial treatments is diminished by lack of motivation for treatment, leading to poor treatment engagement and/or dropout. Motivational interviewing is a brief, clinically-feasible approach that has been successfully used to increase adherence to and efficacy of various treatments, and our pilot data suggest that it may also be effective in improving adherence to cognitive rehabilitation.  Objectives: Our primary objective is to evaluate whether motivational enhancement can improve adherence to cognitive rehabilitation in Veterans with schizophrenia spectrum disorders. Additional objectives are to examine potential mechanisms of action (mediators) and predictors of treatment effects (moderators) associated with providing motivational enhancement for cognitive rehabilitation.  Methods: One hundred twenty Veterans with schizophrenia spectrum diagnoses will be randomized to receive either brief motivational interviewing (MI) or a sham control interview (CI), both of which will be followed by 4 months of cognitive rehabilitation. Booster MI or CI sessions will be administered monthly over the course of the cognitive rehabilitation. Comprehensive assessments will be conducted at baseline and end of cognitive rehabilitation, with additional assessments of task-specific intrinsic motivation, cognitive training task performance, cognition and functional ability at key points throughout the study.  Significance: Improving adherence to cognitive rehabilitation can lead to enhanced cognitive function, which would in turn allow individuals to better take advantage of other psychosocial treatments, resulting in better community functioning. The proposed project will advance a line of research aimed at increasing the efficacy and effectiveness of psychosocial treatments in decreasing disability, improving community function, and promoting social integration in Veterans diagnosed with psychotic disorders. If found efficacious, brief motivational interviewing could also be adapted to enhance adherence to other forms of rehabilitation in Veterans with psychosis or other serious mental illnesses."
"9446211","PROJECT SUMMARY (OVERALL) Drug resistance represents one of the most critical obstacles to clinical benefit for cancer patients. Due to the size and complexity of this challenge, we believe a collaborative team approach is critical and have assembled a team of drug resistance experts from three leading institutions (MGH, the Broad Institute, and MIT/Koch Institute) with an exceptional track record of impactful discoveries in this field. We propose an integrated full- spectrum translational platform?including liquid biopsy, patient-derived tumor models, exome and transcriptome sequencing of tumor tissue, rapid autopsy, functional genomic screens, innovative preclinical mouse models, and a high-throughput combination drug-screening platform covering the CTEP portfolio?to address critical principles of drug resistance across several major cancer types?lung, melanoma and GI cancers, which impact a large percentage of cancer patients. Overall, these three projects will focus on the common theme of bypass resistance mechanisms, a critical ad frequent mechanism of therapeutic resistance that can involve both genetic and adaptive resistance mechanisms that ?bypass? the effects of therapy, and which can drive both intrinsic and acquired resistance. To maximize the potential impact on cancer patients we will focus projects on three major tumor types?lung, melanoma and GI cancers?with each project integrating at least two tumor types. We will focus our projects on defining and overcoming key bypass resistance mechanisms to three of the most critical classes of cancer therapeutics: MAPK inhibitors, RTK inhibitors, and immune checkpoint inhibitors. While each project will focus on a specific therapy and at least two specific cancer types, we believe the overall program design can be readily applied to additional agents and molecularly-defined cancers, such that the ultimate impact of this work will go beyond the specific studies proposed and will serve as a ?blueprint? for critical discoveries related to drug resistance. We anticipate that these efforts will define a new standard in our mechanistic understanding of bypass resistance mechanisms and will lead to novel opportunities to overcome them in the clinic. Our proposed approach will provide a steady stream of novel therapeutic strategies involving CTEP agents and pathways for evaluation in future clinical trials, as well as new potential agents for the CTEP portfolio. We have also integrated cutting-edge strategies for real-time blood-based monitoring of response and resistance to help guide innovative trial design."
"9457724","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Individuals with Down syndrome (DS) have been largely neglected in therapeutic and biomarker studies of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Adults with DS are uniformly affected by AD pathology by their 30's and have a 70-80% chance of clinical dementia by their 60's. In 95% of cases, DS is associated with three copies of chromosome 21, each containing of copy of the Amyloid-beta (A?) Precursor Protein gene (leading to a 1.5-fold increase in A? protein). Yet, nowhere is it clearer than in DS that A? deposition is not sufficiet to produce dementia, as individuals harbor this pathology for over a decade before cognitive decline is apparent. DS can be seen as a setting of amplified sensitivity to risk and protective factors that moderate the relationship between A?, neurodegeneration and clinical dementia. Understanding the factors that moderate this relationship in DS and biomarkers for those factors is critically important in the design of therapeutic trials for AD in DS and in general. Thus, this longitudinal study of Neurodegeneration in Aging DS (NiAD) and its relationship to cognition has the potential to: 1) identify critical factors that link A? deposition to neurodegeneration and, ultimately, dementia; 2) define biomarkers for these factors; and, most importantly, 3) set a foundation for an efficient transition from this biomarker study to a therapeutic trial to combat A in DS augmented by biomarker outcomes. For the past 5 years, the three independent research groups included in this application have been studying the course of A? deposition and other imaging biomarkers and their impact on cognitive/functional measures in adults with DS [(a) the combined Pittsburgh/Madison study; (b) the Banner Alzheimer's Institute study; and (c) the Cambridge study]. In their ongoing work, 140 adults with DS (including 23 with DS/AD-dementia) have undergone magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and amyloid-positron emission tomography (PET) scans and neuropsychological/ functional assessments. These three research groups now propose to combine resources and harmonize all protocols in response to the request from NIA/NICHD to develop a large AD biomarker study in DS. This study will be further strengthened by aligning NiAD with the three largest ongoing longitudinal studies of AD biomarkers in the general population: the Alzheimer Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), the Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer Network (DIAN) and the Alzheimer Prevention Initiative (API). All data will be made available in an open-access format using a model similar to ADNI. The established DS cohort is a significant advantage that will shorten the recruitment phase, maximize longitudinal data that can be acquired and allow for addition of new biomarkers to be compared to longitudinal clinical and imaging measures. The proposed 5-year longitudinal study will examine progression of AD related biomarkers (A?-, tau- and fluorodeoxyglucose-PET, structural and functional MRI, cerebrospinal fluid A? and tau, plasma A? and proteomics, genetics, neuropathology) and cognitive/functional measures in 180 adults with DS (>25 yrs. of age) and 40 biomarker-controls. Subjects will be re-evaluated every 15 months to assess changes in cognition/adaptive functioning and every 30 months to detect biomarker changes."
"9381334","1 PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  2  3 Every year, millions of U.S. women must decide whether to have their uteri removed to treat painful and  4 incapacitating gynecologic disorders, such as uterine fibroids, endometriosis, and prolapse. Unfortunately,  5 decisions about hysterectomy may be influenced as much by a woman's race as by objective clinical  6 indications. Despite hysterectomy's prevalence, little is known about how these surgery decisions are made:  7 the existing literature is limited by non-generalizable single-institution studies, racially homogenous samples,  8 inadequate control for symptom severity, and inability to measure the influences of the culture of the healthcare  9 system. The long-term goal of this proposal is to ensure that women of all backgrounds are treated in an 10 equitable manner when it comes to hysterectomy decision-making. To achieve this goal, the objectives of this 11 application are to understand where racial differences in treatment with gynecologic surgery arise and to 12 evaluate the extent to which racial/ethnic differences in hysterectomy treatment constitute surgical disparities. 13 The central hypothesis is that clinical severity will not fully account for all racial/ethnic differences in 14 hysterectomy treatment. We hypothesize that provider-level and practice-level clinical culture can impede 15 equitable dissemination of surgical innovations in hysterectomy. The rationale for the proposed research is that 16 identifying multilevel health care-system influences on hysterectomy receipt will help identify the best targets 17 on which to intervene to achieve equitable surgical care of women's gynecologic conditions. The hypotheses 18 will be tested by pursuing three specific aims: 1) Determine the extent to which the clinical threshold for 19 hysterectomy (uterine weight, pre-operative anemia, pre-operative pain) varies by race/ethnicity; 2) Quantify 20 the extent to which minority patients are differentially likely to be treated by low-volume providers and by 21 practices with high propensity to perform hysterectomy; and 3) Identify drivers of the dissemination of bilateral 22 salpingectomy with ovarian retention (BSOR) at the time of hysterectomy and the extent to which this 23 dissemination varied by race/ethnicity. This approach is innovative because it directly evaluates the 24 longstanding but untested hypothesis that racial differences in clinical severity explain differences in 25 hysterectomy rates. The work also employs an innovative multilevel framework including provider- and 26 practice-level factors. Finally, the work investigates how surgical culture can facilitate or impede the 27 dissemination of a cancer risk-reducing surgical innovation. This work will have sustained impact because it 28 goes beyond documenting racial differences: when this work is completed, we will understand what disparities 29 exist but also how these differences arise. Gynecologic problems are under-investigated relative to their high 30 prevalence, impact on quality of life, and long-term effects of treatment on the health of tens of millions of U.S. 31 women. Fortunately, hysterectomy is both common and amenable to change; therefore, identifying targets to 32 improve equity in the surgery can exert a powerful influence on the gynecologic surgery field. 33 1"
"9371529","PROJECT SUMMARY An important question in developmental biology is how cell fate specification and cell movement are coordinated during tissue morphogenesis to ensure all cell types reach their desired positions properly. One example of this elegant coordination is the patterning of neural progenitors in the zebrafish spinal cord. In this proposal, I will combine biophysical and genetic approaches to understand how cell fate specification and cell adhesion are coordinated in the zebrafish neural tube. Studies from my early postdoctoral training have identified E-cadherin (Cdh1), N-cadherin (Cdh2), and their transcriptional regulators as critical mediators for patterning of neural progenitor domains. Building on these initial findings, this proposal aims to obtain a multi- scale understanding of spinal cord pattern formation from the differential adhesion forces mediated by Cdh1 and Cdh2 in different neural progenitor cell types (Aim1), to the gene regulatory network controlling the spatial patterns of Cdh1 and Cdh2 expressions (Aim2), to a computational framework to simulate cell sorting at the tissue scale (Aim1). The experimental platform established in Aims 1 and 2 will be used to characterize novel regulators of cell adhesion dynamics during spinal cord pattern formation and morphogenesis (Aim 3). This proposal will combine my analytical skills developed as a graduate student to analyze spatiotemporal dynamics of adhesion molecules at cellular and subcellular levels, the experimental knowledge acquired during my early postdoctoral training to genetically engineer zebrafish and image live embryos with single cell resolution, and the proposed training during the K99 mentored phase to probe cell mechanics and optically perturb gene expression at high spatiotemporal precision. The training during the K99 mentored phase will integrate the expertise of all four of my co-mentors and will complement my past training to form a complete research program in my own independent lab to measure, perturb, and model spatiotemporal dynamics of adhesion molecules in neural progenitor cells during spinal cord development. My plan for transitioning to independence include professional trainings from all four of my co-mentors to mentor students, manage labs, write grants, publish papers, present research results in conferences, and establish scientific collaborations. By learning and interacting with all four co-mentors in different academic institutes, I will combine their strength to formulate my own lab culture and mentoring style. My long-term career goal is to direct a multidisciplinary research program studying the control of spatiotemporal dynamics of cellular and subcellular events underlying robust embryo development. So far I have achieved significant progress towards this goal in the form of research experience, successful publications, and initiation of collaborations. I firmly believe, however, that a K99 mentored phase will help maximize my chances for success by providing access to additional mentorship and training that would be otherwise lacking from my current postdoctoral experience."

"9551999","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):      Abstract: Symptoms due to pathology of the neck are among the most common complaints that patients bring to the attention of neurologists and physiatrists. In this Pilot study we propose to  develop two variants of a motion capable neck brace to serve these clinical situations. First, we will build and improve a neck brace for ALS patients with severe neck weakness. The inability to hold up the head not only decreases the quality of life, it can also decrease airway protection leading to the most common cause of death in ALS patients. The novel device will allow the patient to control the position of the head that is optimal for each activity. Secondly, we will develop a highly adjustable neck brace for the management of neck pain and cervical radiculopathy, two of the most common presenting symptoms in the neurology clinic. This neck brace can also be used for patients at risk for cervical cord compression but who are not surgical candidates. The novel device will provide increased stability, potential for traction, and  the ability to easily adjust neck position. This Pilot study seeks to determine safety and tolerability and to identify potential benefits. Demonstration of safety, tolerability, and potentil benefits will allow full clinical trials for each of the devices. If successful these studies will provide a much need prostheses for a relatively neglected but important area of neural rehabilitation."
"9330675","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The transformation from a manufacturing economy to one based heavily on services and technology has resulted in the depopulation and impoverishment of communities that have depended primarily on their industrial bases. Consequent blight and neglect, coupled with a lack of opportunities for youth with high school educations or less, have resulted in elevated rates of youth violence in many affected cities. The Michigan Youth Violence Prevention Center (MI-YVPC) will study the effects of improving vacant properties on violence, property crimes and intentional injuries among youth in Flint, MI, Youngstown, OH and Camden, NJ. We will compare a community and youth-engaged approach to maintaining and improving vacant properties to similar maintenance implemented by contractors from outside the neighborhoods. We will assign properties to receive community-engaged or professional maintenance and compare the effects of these two conditions to vacant lots that are unimproved. We will also conduct a three-phased implementation study that will involve documenting the development of greening activities in Camden, NJ, and survey over 100 communities nationwide who have implemented greening programs about their experiences and lessons learned in creating their programs and engaging youth in the process. The aims of the Center are to: 1) implement and evaluate community-level strategies in Flint and Youngstown and analyze the relationship between changes in the physical environment and 10-24 year old youth violence; 2) test alternative approaches to greening, contrasting professional maintenance with youth engagement through intergenerational collaboration in Flint and Youngstown on police incidents, youth intentional injury, parcel assessment of nearby properties, and resident survey responses; 3) document the process of community readiness and capacity needs for implementation of a greening program in Camden, NJ; 4) identify lessons learned that facilitate or hinder development of community and youth engaged greening programs, and disseminate the results of our research to local, state, and national audiences through a wide variety of venues, including a freely available implementation guide. The MI-YVPC is a partnership among the University of Michigan, University of Pennsylvania, Rutgers University, the Center for Community Progress, and land banks, economic development organizations, health departments, hospitals, police departments and community-based organizations in each city."
"9377510","ABSTRACT Chronic illness disproportionately affects lower-socioeconomic (SES) populations and typically strikes at a younger age than their higher-SES counterparts. This means that many working-age (40-64 years), lower-SES adults face limitations to activity and daily functioning related to the negative physical, mental and emotional effects of living with chronic illness. Evidence-based self-management programs are effective at mitigating the health and economic outcomes of chronic illness amongst this population, yet few have successfully engaged lower-SES, working age adults. Upon further exploration, this lack of engagement could be due to the failure of previous studies to design recruitment materials tailored to the motivations of this vulnerable population who, in addition to managing their chronic illness, typically juggle higher levels of work and family-related demands than younger or older adults. Thus, the purpose of the proposed study is to identify communication cues that effectively engage this underserved population in self-management-related research. This study will be conducted as an ancillary study to a parent randomized control trial (RCT) currently underway at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. This CDC-funded parent-RCT is testing the health and economic benefits of the Chronic Disease Self-management Program amongst lower-income workers ages 40-64. The proposed study will analyze quantitative data gathered from participants of the RCT regarding their preferences for communication cues featured in study advertisements, their processing and appraisal of such cues, their motivation to enroll in the study, and their subsequent enrollment and program participation. The aims of this project are to identify cue preferences that are most highly associated with these five levels of cognitive and behavioral engagement (cue processing, appraisal, motivation, enrollment and program participation) in a study testing a self-management program, to assess the extent to which cognitive engagement constructs (cue processing, appraisal and motivation) are associated with behavioral engagement (enrollment and program participation), and to assess whether key demographic variables moderate the findings of Aims 1 & 2. The results of this research may help answer NINR's Innovative Questions concerning how to translate evidence-based self-management programs to new populations. Furthermore, the knowledge gained during this study may also be used to guide future nurses as they attempt to engage this hard-to-reach demographic not only in self-management research, but in a variety of studies aimed to enhance health behavior."
"9448990","Project Summary Exploring the biology of O-acetyl sialic acids using stable synthetic mimics The term ?sialic acid? tends to be used synonymously with N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac, often called ?NANA?). In fact, Neu5Ac is just the most common member of a diverse family of molecules. O-Acetylated sialic acids are widespread in humans, other vertebrates, and some pathogenic bacteria. The O-acetyl modifications are well known to play key roles in many biological and pathological processes, in fields as diverse as immunology, oncology, virology and neuroscience. However, despite their discovery many decades ago, the study of these modifications has been greatly hampered by their instability. O-Acetyl groups can be hydrolyzed easily by small pH changes or by esterases, and O-acetyl groups at C-7 and C-8 of sialic acids can migrate to C-9, sometimes even under physiological conditions. To date, there is no reliable approach to systematically investigate the cell biology or pathology of sialoglycans containing these labile O-acetyl groups. This proposal brings together for the first time three labs with the combined chemical, biological, and computational expertise to jointly tackle this long-standing problem in a new and systematic way. We hypothesized that substituting O-acetyl on sialic acids by N-acetyl groups is a suitable strategy to provide stable mimics for investigating these important molecules. For proof of principle, we have shown experimentally and computationally that 5,9-di-N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac9NAc) is a good mimic of naturally occurring 9-O-acetyl-5-N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5,9Ac2) in various types of studies. In the current proposal we will further investigate this molecule, as well as a library of N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac) derivatives with N-acetylation at C-4, C-7, or C-8, or with two N-acetyl groups at C-7 and C-9, at C-8 and C-9, or at C-4 and C-9, all representing stable mimics of unstable O-acetylated sialic acids that are known to occur in nature, but have remained underexplored. Sialosides containing these N-acetyl Neu5Ac derivatives will be chemoenzymatically synthesized and used as probes to study the ligand specificity of various sialic acid- binding proteins of mammalian or microbial origin. The structural comparison of O-acetylated sialosides and their N-acetylated counterparts will also be explored by computational methods and by NMR studies. This project will design and generate important approaches to elucidate fundamental mechanisms and biological consequences of sialic acid O-acetylation, opening the door to many previously intractable questions. This, in turn, will help to develop potential diagnostic and therapeutic approaches for infectious, malignant or immune processes involving these common but poorly understood sialic acid forms. In the long run, the approach can be extended to other O-acylated sialic acids in nature such as 9-O-lactyl-Neu5Ac (Neu5Ac9Lt), and O- acetylated forms of non-human N-glycolylneuraminic acid (Neu5Gc) which might be incorporated into humans from exogenous sources."
"9422649","Abnormal accumulation of misfolded Tau protein is tightly linked pathogenically to a group of brain degenerative disorders including Alzheimer's disease (AD) that are collectively called Tauopathies. Currently there is no effective prevention or treatment avenue against these debilitating diseases. Targeted clearance of misfolded, pathogenic Tau species thus represents one potentially vital therapeutic strategy. A flurry of recent studies, corroborating with a long history of clinical observations, have led to the proposal that Huntington's disease (HD), another fatal neurodegenerative disorder caused by an abnormal expansion of a glutamine tract (polyQ) in Huntingtin (HTT) protein, is also a tauopathy disease. Interestingly, while working on the HTT homolog in Drosophila, we found that normal HTT can promote the clearance of certain misfolding-prone Tau species by acting as a scaffold in selective autophagy, a subtype of autophagy-lysosomal pathway that requires cargo receptors such as p62/SQSTM1 to recognize and target specific cytosolic components for lysosomal degradation. Subsequent studies in mammalian cells and in mouse AD models further supported this finding, which, together with the known autophagic phenotypes in HD cells and in mice expressing polyQ-deleted HTT, suggest a scenario that polyQ expansion in HTT disrupts its own activity in promoting selective autophagy and normal Tau turnover, leading to the Tau pathology. Such a hypothesis not only supports the HTT-mediated autophagy pathway as a converging mechanism linking HD and Tauopathy, but also raises the promise of harnessing this conserved innate protective pathway for targeted removal of pathogenic Tau in Tauopathies. In this joint R01 application, we will use our established assays in the complementary Drosophila, cellular, and mouse model systems to rigorously and systematically test this hypothesis at the genetic, biochemical and functional levels. Taking advantage of the conserved HTT and autophagy pathways, as well as the availability of a plethora of Tau models and Tau toxicity assays established in Drosophila, we will use flies as an in vivo tool to evaluate the effect of polyQ lengths on the autophagic function of HTT, and to examine the discrete Tau species to search for the ones that can be degraded by the HTT-mediated selective autophagy and for their common signatures; Using mammalian cell-based assays, we will validate the findings from the flies and also probe the molecular mechanisms underlying the modulatory role of the polyQ stretch on HTT activities. Finally, by manipulating Tau and HTT in the well-characterized mouse HD and AD models, we will directly validate our hypothesis and findings in an in vivo setting that is physiologically closer to humans. Completion of this project will reveal novel mechanistic insight into the crosstalk between Tauopathy and HD, and establish the feasibility of future pharmacological exploitation of the novel selectively autophagy pathway to combat morbidity and mortality arising from Tau-associated AD and other Tauopathies."
"9397429","DESCRIPTION     Mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) due to exposure to explosive blasts is a common occurrence in veterans  returning from recent deployments. Although mTBI is not associated with gross brain damage visible on  standard radiological examinations, a subset of individuals report long-term disruptions of cognitive and  emotional functioning, suggesting that more subtle neural damage may exist. Given results from civilian mTBI,  the damage is likely to be spatially variable across individuals and to affect white matter (WM) tracts  connecting distant brain regions. Therefore, measures of brain connectivity may be vital for understanding the  neurological effects of deployment-related mTBI (dTBI). In particular, quantification of changes in brain  connectivity, rather than simply end-state differences, associated with dTBI may be especially informative.   The proposed research plan will investigate deployment-related changes in MRI-based measures of  structural and functional connectivity, as well as clinical and neuropsychological measures, in a population of  military service members being deployed for the first time. The effect of dTBI on these changes will be tested  as well as potential moderating effects of combat stress and other deployment experiences. In addition, the  presence of baseline differences in connectivity measures and the effect of these differences on deployment-  related changes will be investigated. The overall goals of the proposed research plan are to characterize the  neural effects of blast mTBI on brain connectivity and the potential moderating effects of pre-deployment and  in-theater factors by pursuing the following aims:   Aim 1: To investigate the longitudinal effects of dTBI and deployment experiences on brain connectivity  and cognitive performance, as well as the inter-relationships among these changes.   Aim 2: To investigate the effects of factors present prior to deployment (e.g. history of civilian mTBI) on pre-  deployment brain connectivity and longitudinal changes in connectivity and cognition.   The most unique elements of this research plan are the inclusion of neuroimaging data from service  members with no prior deployment, the collection of pre- and post-deployment longitudinal neuroimaging data,  and the explicit examination of relationships among changes in structural connectivity, functional connectivity,  and neuropsychological measures. These elements allow the neural changes associated with deployment in general and bTBI in particular to be characterized in a comprehensive manner.   The candidate seeks to use this Career Development experience to build on his existing expertise using  neuroimaging methods to study clinical conditions, to develop his skills in clinical assessment of TBI and  related conditions, to provide opportunities for VA service, and to establish a rich set of resources for  establishing an independent research career within VA. He will accomplish this by working closely with his  mentors, administering neuropsychological tests in research and clinical settings, and providing educational,  academic, and clinical service to a range of VA centers. The candidate will meet regularly with his mentors  throughout the study period to use their wealth of experience to ensure that the study is designed and  implemented in a manner most likely to accomplish the proposed aims, contribute to veterans' care, and build  a pool of resources that will fuel applications for future funded research. He will engage in a range of training  activities that combine coursework with direct patient contact, as well as service activities that include  education of clinicians and military leadership, participation in administrative committees (e.g. IRB), and  integration of research and clinical aims of the Minneapolis Polytrauma Rehabilitation Center. In addition to  providing necessary training and experience in conditions of high relevance to veteran care, these activities will  help Dr. Davenport integrate himself with the resources available at the Minneapolis VA Health Care System  that will be used to establish an independent VA research career."
"9340036","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a rare condition that is thought to occur as a result of an interaction between genetic risk and environmental exposures. Although a number of major genes are known to cause ALS in up to 15% of patients with a familial form of the disease, the precise genetic factors that increase risk in the remainin 85% o are not well understood. Similarly, the environmental factors that increase risk have not been well established. The availability of population-based disease registers have allowed us to accurately calculate the incidence of ALS in populations of European ancestral origin. These registers have also allowed us to conduct large studies of cases and controls to increase our understanding of environmental risk factors, and to begin to understand gene-environment interactions that might increase this risk of developing ALS.  Conversely, little is known about the true rates or characteristics of the condition in populations outside of Europe and the United States, and in those of mixed ancestral origin. There is some evidence to suggest that the rates of ALS are lower in the Hispanic population in North America, but this may be due to difficulties encountered by minorities in accessing healthcare. Because ALS is rare large scale population based studies of incidence, prevalence, phenotype and risk factors are necessary. Detailed population based studies including all minority groups are challenging to perform in the United States, notwithstanding the recent development of the CDC ALS Registry. Moreover, the ALS Registry does not have the facility to capture incident cases in real time. We have already undertaken a large population based incident study in Europe as part of a Research Consortium (The European multidisciplinary ALS network identification to cure motor neurone degeneration, EuroMOTOR). To understand the impact of ancestral origin and geographic exposure on ALS in the United States, we now propose to use the methods developed by our EuroMOTOR Consortium study ALS in 3 populations from South America that are of mixed ancestral origin. The purpose of this study is to compare the rates and features of ALS in Hispanic populations with the rates and features of ALS in European populations. We will also use our established methods to collect information about occupational history and various exposures to determine whether the risks in Hispanic patients from South America are similar to those we identify in European populations. The outcome of this work will establish for the first time whether Hispanic populations in the Americas have lower rates of ALS compared to Europeans, whether the features of the disease are the same, and whether the risks of developing the disease differ depending on geographic and ancestral origin. This will help to understand the variance in ALS rates across the United States, and will help to test the hypothesis that Hispanic populations in the United States are protected from developing the disease. This in turn will help us to develop new models of disease causation in the United States ALS population, that can in turn help us to find new therapies for all forms of ALS."
"9447778","ABSTRACT Gene expression relies on interplay among cis elements, chromatin domains, and genome architecture. The latter is of intense interest as ~10% of human diseases may arise from defects in genome topology that impact gene expression. Genomes divide into conserved, Mb-sized topologically associated domains (TADs) that are further subdivided into cell type-specific loops between promoter and enhancers (regulatory loops) or between CTCF binding elements (structural loops). In addition, chromatin architecture can be shaped by tissue-specific boundary elements (BEs) that divide active and inactive regions of transcription. These two types of domains tend to associate spatially, perhaps through homotypic chromatin interactions. Foundational questions remain about mechanisms of genome architecture reorganization and its impact on gene expression during cellular differentiation. Answers to these questions have important implications because disease-associated variants in the human genome can disrupt CTCF sites or BEs, enabling aberrant communication between enhancers and alternative promoters that normally partition into separate architectural domains. The co-PIs have approached relationships between genome topology and gene regulation by focusing on the mouse Tcrb antigen receptor locus for several reasons, including: (i) it is a physiological model of manageable complexity (ii) its architecture and transcription are dynamically regulated during T cell development, (iii) it divides into alternating chromatin domains, (iv) changes in topology and transcription are critical for Tcrb assembly by long-range recombination, and (v) its recombination center (RC) has a simple regulatory landscape with one enhancer that communicates with two promoters to initiate all aspects of Tcrb assembly. The PIs' recent collaborations have provided important clues into the dynamics of Tcrb structure at a low level of resolution, but insights into mechanisms that sculpt the observed architectural changes are still lacking. These and other data support their hypothesis that developmental switches between inactive and active Tcrb conformations are orchestrated by tissue- and stage-specific changes in the binding of CTCF to cornerstone elements and by the transcription status of individual gene segments, which cooperate to compartmentalize Tcrb into distinct structural domains and drive homotypic interactions that facilitate long-range Tcrb gene assembly. To test foundational aspects of their hypothesis, the PIs propose to elucidate detailed topologies of active versus inactive Tcrb loci (Aim 1), assess whether transcription status and homotypic chromatin interactions shape Tcrb conformations (Aim 2), and determine mechanisms by which CTCF elements direct Tcrb topology (Aim 3). The co-PIs will monitor multiple physiological readouts (topology, transcription, chromatin, and recombination) to gain unprecedented insights into mechanistic relationships among genome architecture, gene expression, DNA recombination, and factors that sculpt primary lymphocyte antigen receptor gene repertoires"

"9420395","ABSTRACT:  The strategic plan of the NIH's BRAIN Initiative (BRAIN 2025: A scientific Vision) calls for transformative technological developments with MRI to achieve ?submillimeter spatial resolution descriptions of neuronal activity, functional and structural connectivity, and network analysis in the human brain through advances in instrumentation, data acquisition and analysis techniques?. The primary aim of this grant application is specifically to undertake such technological developments. We plan to usher in the next generation MR instrumentation, and data acquisition and image reconstruction methods in order to reach and span currently unavailable spatial scales in human brain studies, going from neuronal ensembles composed of few thousand neurons to whole brain function and structural connectivity. The focus of the proposed work will be resting state- and task- or stimulus-based functional imaging (fMRI), and diffusion imaging (dMRI) methods for tractography and white-matter microstructure determination. We present a strategy, based on ample preliminary data, to develop and implement unique and novel gradients, B0 shims, RF coils, image acquisition and reconstruction methods, and previously unavailable 10.5 Tesla ultrahigh magnetic field. As a result of the cumulative gains from the proposed technologies, we anticipate an order of magnitude or more reduction in voxel volumes, thus reaching and even exceeding the resolution targets set forth in the BRAIN Initiative strategic plan. Using this new capability, we also plan to generate a publicly available database that will enable the most complete and accurate description of the functional and structural connections among gray matter locations in the human brain to date, and facilitate advanced computational modeling of how information is encoded by neural populations in the human brain.  The proposed developments will be carried out by a consortium composed of investigators from the University of Minnesota Center for Magnetic Resonance Research (CMRR), Stanford University Lucas Center for Imaging, Penn State Center for NMR Research, NYU Center for Biomedical Imaging and Oxford University; together they bring to this project unique experience and track record of accomplishments in high resolution functional and diffusion imaging, ultrahigh magnetic field technology and applications, RF pulse and pulse sequence development, multichannel transmit technology, gradient design and construction, manufacturing and use of novel dielectric materials, RF coil design and construction, and image reconstruction and post- processing."

This study aims to characterize the infectious causes of Acute Febrile Illness (AFI) among patients in India, in Sub-District Hospitals in Western Ghat region of India covering Karnataka, Kerala and Tamil Nadu. The study will focus on bacterial, rickettsial and viral causes of AFI. Based on historical patient volumes, it is estimated that approximately 400 patients will be enrolled (i.e., fit the study case definition) over the course of one year between the study sites in the first phase or first year of study. This study plans to roll out in the core area of Shimoga District of Karnataka in the first year to optimize on resources and roll it out to Kerala in secon y ear and Tamil Nadu in the third year. The additions from Kerala and Tamil Nadu would be 200 each. So at the end of 3rd year the intake in the study shall be 800.        Patients and/or parents/guardians will be asked to participate at the time of initial presen tation, after determination by the treating clinician that a Blood profile including Complete Blood Count and Blood Culture as well as for those with neurological syndrome lumbar puncture is clinically indicated for patient management. Hospital laboratories routinely perform Gram stain, glucose/protein levels, cell count, and bacterial culture (where media/reagents are available) on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) obtained via lumbar puncture from patients with AFI. This study would look for pathogens by using ELISA based serological tests and subject the specimen to a battery of other tests to lead to pathogen detection.        In our study, clinical samples will be tested for a variety of etiologies associated with AFI such as, Bacterial pathogens (Leptospira, Salmonella, Brucella, Lyme borrelia, S. pneumoniae, H.influenzae, N. meningitidis, Shigella, Campylobacter etc.  ), Rickettsial group of organisms (Scrub typhus, Spotted fever group, Ehrlichia, Anaplasma etc.) and Viruses ( KFD, Dengue, Japanese Encephalitis, West Nile Virus, Chikungunya virus, Tick borne Encephalitis virus, Crimean Congo Hemorrhagic Fever virus, Influenza viruses, Respiratory Syncytial Virus, Adenovirus, Coronaviruses, Enteroviruses, Diarrhoeagenic viruses etc.) Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and serologic analyses of patient blood, CSF, Throat swab and Stool samples will be used to identify additional pathogens known to cause Acute febrile illness. Clinical samples also will be tested for unknown pathogens using PCR- sequence based pathogen discovery techniques."
"9450411","PROJECT SUMMARY Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas (PDA) develop an intense fibroinflammatory infiltrate that helps promote disease progression and therapeutic resistance. Recent progress has identified essential barriers in this complex microenvironment that impede drug delivery and suppress immunity. These processes include the prohibitive interstitial pressures generated by high concentrations of hyaluronan (HA) complexed with water, dense fibrosis associated with fibrillar collagen deposition, and multiple classes of immunosuppressive and pro-tumorigenic cells such as myeloid-derived suppressor cells and macrophages. The team assembled in this project has made many of the seminal discoveries described above. In addition, we have developed several highly novel and powerful experimental platforms to rigorously interrogate the complex mechanisms and interactions among various compartments in the tumor microenvironment that collectively conspire to promote the survival of pancreas cancers and metastases and thwart treatment. Our overarching hypothesis is that significantly improving survival for PDA patients will require targeting not only the tumor epithelial cell, but also the three compartments that support its oncogenesis: hematopoietic, mesenchymal and extracellular matrix. In the following, we propose to investigate the combination of cytotoxic therapy with stromal disruption and myeloid cell modulations to maximize engagement of anti-tumor immunity and treatment efficacy. We will pursue these investigations in four distinct experimental platforms that offer complementary strengths and mitigate limitations: 1) genetically engineered mouse models (GEMM) of autochthonous PDA; 2) syngeneic allografts; 3) patient-derived xenograft (PDX) systems; and 4) patient-derived organoids (PDO)."
"9473259","Project Summary  Innate immunity requires cellular restriction factors that inhibit the replication of multiple pathogens. One group of restriction factors is the apolipoprotein B mRNA editing enzyme, catalytic polypeptide-like (Apobec) family of cytosine deaminases, including activation-induced cytosine deaminase (AID). AID function includes both innate and adaptive immune responses due to its role in control of retrotransposons as well as somatic hypermutation of immunoglobulin variable regions and class switch recombination. Apobec family enzymes are known inhibitors of complex human retroviruses, such as the lentivirus human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1), as well as DNA-containing viruses. HIV-1 encodes an Apobec antagonist, Vif and, in the absence of Vif, the provirus sustains high numbers of G to A hypermutations due to cytosine deamination on the minus strand during reverse transcription. My laboratory has shown that mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) is the only known complex mouse retrovirus with organizational and functional features similar to HIV, such as the regulatory protein Rem. Rem is a precursor protein that is cleaved by signal peptidase at the ER membrane to give an N-terminal signal peptide (SP) that has Rev-like function and a C-terminal protein of unknown function. Inoculation of cloned MMTV lacking Rem expression into BALB/c mice resulted in mammary tumors with a decreased incidence and latency compared to wild-type MMTV. Characterization of MMTV proviruses from these mammary tumors showed extensive G to A as well as other transition mutations on both DNA strands, consistent with AID-type mutations, but also some typical of the consensus sequences and strand specificity of murine Apobec3 (mA3) or other deaminases. Transfection experiments revealed proteasomal degradation of AID in the presence of Rem, but not mA3. These results led us to the hypothesis that Rem is an HIV-1 Vif-like antagonist of multiple Apobec cytosine deaminases. This application will test several aspects of this hypothesis. In Aim 1, we will determine sequences within Rem and AID that are necessary for proteasomal degradation. We will identify the E3 ligase for AID protein interactions in the presence and absence of Rem using screens that detect biotinylation of interacting proteins by BirA or conjugation to an AID-ubiquitin fusion protein. The role of Rem retrotranslocation for AID degradation will be investigated. In Aim 2, MMTVs or T-cell variants lacking Rem expression will be used to determine the types of transition mutations observed in proviruses after infections of knockout mice lacking one or more Apobec genes. These studies will use a complex mouse retrovirus to explore aspects of innate immunity that are difficult to test in vivo with human viruses. Our experiments will provide improved understanding of Apobec function as well as potential application to the treatment of human infectious diseases and cancers."

"9449992","Project Summary This proposal seeks to build on our extensive preliminary data in canine immunotherapy trials to demonstrate that novel methods of exogenous cytokine delivery in combination with autologous natural killer (NK) cells in first-in-dog clinical trials represents a potentially high impact approach to optimize non-T cell based immunotherapies. This work is targeted to dogs with typically lethal, naturally occurring osteosarcoma (OSA) and melanoma, and the findings are expected to have important relevance for the design and translation of innovative immunotherapy approaches in humans. Inhaled (IH) IL-15 offers the advantages of local delivery of this immune-stimulatory cytokine, while limiting systemic exposure and thus potential toxicity. Super-agonist IL- 15 offers increased half-life and greater anti-tumor effects. Therefore, each of these cytokines is anticipated to alter the risk/benefit ratio in favor of their use. To accomplish these objectives, we propose the following three specific aims: 1) Targeting gross pulmonary metastases (OSA and melanoma) with first-in-dog delivery of inhaled (IH) human IL-15 and super-agonist IL-15; 2) Phase II trial of IH IL-15 and autologous NK cells to treat gross OSA and melanoma pulmonary metastases, and; 3) Targeting micro-metastatic disease using super- agonist IL-15 in primary OSA. The canine model represents a powerful tool in cancer immunotherapy research as an important link between murine models and human clinical studies. Dogs represent an attractive outbred combination of companion animals that experience spontaneous cancer development in the setting of an intact immune system. Importantly, these studies are designed to evaluate novel treatment combinations for advanced pulmonary metastases in the setting of gross disease, but also will determine the impact of this approach as first-line therapy when combined with standard-of-care treatments. Moreover, this work seeks to elucidate the cellular and molecular mechanisms that mediate an anti-tumor response (or non-response) in dogs with naturally occurring cancers. We will have the unique opportunity to perform whole exome sequencing and RNASeq on tumor tissue pre- and post-immunotherapy, and we will investigate whether a signature of mutational landscape and gene expression profiles can be developed to prospectively predict outcome and response to immune therapies. We will correlate these data to immunohistochemical, flow cytometry, and serum cytokine readouts for evidence of transition from ?cold? to ?hot? tumors predictive of favorable long term outcome. Hence, these canine trials and bio-marker studies represent an ideal strategy to inform and facilitate the rapid translation of novel, potentially high impact immune therapies to human patients with aggressive cancers."
"9366100","  Summary/Abstract  In the US, diabetic retinopathy is the leading cause of blindness in working age adults and remains a public health problem throughout the world. The earliest manifestations of this eye disease are believed to originate in capillary dysfunction resulting in both over- and under perfusion of regional capillaries. And while these changes in microvascular structure have been identified as hallmarks of the disease, the earliest functional changes in this microscopic network remain unclear. Is microvascular flow impaired early before capillary structural changes, or does the formation of aberrant vessel patterns, as a consequence, profoundly change retinal capillary flow?  Conventional retina cameras generally lack the necessary resolution to study capillary-level blood flow because the eye's optics blur the microscopic capillaries at the back of the eye. In this study, we develop and deploy a new retinal camera that turns the eye into a high-power microscope to study single cell blood flow the back of the living eye. Combined with the optical improvements of this adaptive optics camera which corrects for image blur, we have coupled two other innovations to image the movement of individual blood cells as they move through the tiniest of capillaries only 1/10th the thickness of a human hair. First, blood cells are not only microscopic, but they also move at fast rates of speed. To image these blood cells free of motion blur, the use of a high-speed camera is required. In this research project, we combine the blur-correcting optics with an exceptionally fast camera that can capture over 30,000 snapshots per second. This camera is focused at single capillaries and can image the blood cells as they flow by -one by one. This advancement allows us to measure blood cell speed and provide exact counts of the number of passing blood cells, two innovative measures of blood flow at the capillary level. A second innovation uses special light-scattering properties of blood cells to provide highly detailed images of blood cell boundaries against the vessel wall and surrounding tissue. The resultant images provide not only high resolution images of blood cells, but can also provide unprecedented measures of blood cell type and their deformation within microvessels of the eye. By tracking the progressive changes in capillary flow and microvascular structure over the course of diabetes from weeks- to-years, we seek to better understand the earliest events leading to vascular disease of the eye. In this study, we examine the impact of high blood sugar levels on a mouse model of human diabetes. Changes in single- cell blood flow will be non-invasively imaged over time to determine the impact of diabetes on the smallest vessels of the eye.    "
"9316335","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Glaucoma is a chronic optic neuropathy resulting in visual field defects and progressive, irreversible vision loss. Glaucoma is the second leading cause of blindness in the United States. Primary open-angle glaucoma is the most common form. Rates of glaucoma are projected to increase by 50% to 3.36 million people by 2020, causing a significant economic and quality of life burden. Risk factors for glaucoma include advanced age (65+ years), family history of glaucoma, race (African American, Asian), and ethnicity (Hispanic/Latino). Diabetes is also an independent risk factor for glaucoma. African Americans develop glaucoma at a younger age, progress more rapidly, and are almost 7 times more likely to go blind than non-Hispanic Caucasians. Despite the advanced technology and available diagnostic testing, 50% of people with glaucoma remain undiagnosed. When glaucoma is diagnosed in its early stages, appropriate treatment and management can almost always prevent blindness. Under the leadership of L. Jay Katz, MD; Julia A. Haller, MD; and Lisa Hark, PhD, RD, the Wills Eye Glaucoma Research Center will conduct a 5-year prospective, randomized controlled trial to test an innovative community intervention using fundus photography of the optic nerve and macula (telemedicine) to detect, treat, and manage high-risk patients with previously undiagnosed glaucoma and other eye diseases. Our diverse, targeted at-risk population includes African Americans, Hispanics and Asian over age 40; older adults (aged 65+); and those over age 40 with a family history of glaucoma and/or diabetes. Phase 1 will consist of recruiting approximately 2,000 patients from 14 primary care offices and 10 federally qualified health centers across Philadelphia and Chester counties with our community partners. Using telemedicine, we will detect eye disease using telemedicine (Visit 1) followed by a comprehensive eye exam by a glaucoma specialist to confirm the diagnosis (Visit 2). Based on preliminary data, 30% of patients (approximately 600) will have abnormal optic nerve and/or macula images. The predictive accuracy of the optic nerve images to detect glaucoma and glaucoma suspect as confirmed by the comprehensive eye exam will be evaluated. Phase 2 will involve consenting, enrolling, and randomizing 300 patients to either the usual care group (n=150) or the enhanced intervention group (n=150) and scheduling follow-up eye exams with local, general ophthalmologists (Visit 3). The enhanced intervention will consist of using patient navigators and a social worker to reduce barriers to follow-up eye care. Phase 3 will consist of following patients proximally (6 months) and distally (3 years) while they attend ophthalmology appointments (Visits 4-8). Adherence to follow-up recommendations for eye care will be the primary outcome measure. A comprehensive cost study to estimate the intervention costs and cost-effectiveness of detecting eye diseases and vision impairment in a high-risk population will also be conducted. Protocols, materials, and results will be disseminated to other communities in order to expand detection of glaucoma, other eye diseases, and visual impairment, and to further refine these approaches."
"9397335","ABSTRACT Congenital heart disease (CHD) is the most common birth defect?occurring in as many as 3 in every 100 live births. Despite its frequency, the genetic etiologies of CHD remain elusive due to prevalent contribution of noncoding variation and genetic modifiers. As a lab we attempt to distill this complexity though understanding the underlying gene regulatory networks involved in CHD. In this study, we uncover a gene regulatory network essential for the proper development of cardiovascular lineages downstream of the hedgehog (hh) signaling, a master regulator of cell fate determination. Our previous work has shown that Hedgehog signaling is required for second heart field-derived cardiac structures. Using Genetic Inducible Fate Mapping, we observed that late labeling of cardiac progenitors (E8.5 and later) labeled only second heart field structures while early labeling of cardiac progenitors (E6.5) additionally labeled first heart field derived structures. Germline removal of all hh signaling, through ablation of a key membrane-bound receptor, smoothened (smo), caused hypoplasia of the linear heart tube, a failure of chamber expansion, and early embryonic lethality. Conditional smo removal using Mesp1-Cre recapitulated the germline phenotype whereas smo removal using Nxk2-5-Cre supported chamber formation, restricting the requirement for hh signaling to early mesoderm. RNA-seq of Mesp1+ cells overexpressing Gli3R, the primary hh-signaling transcriptional repressor revealed upregulation of lineage- determining transcriptional programs for differentiating cardiovascular lineages at embryonic day 7.5 but down- regulation of factors involved with maintenance of progenitor identity. We hypothesize that hedgehog signaling controls a gene regulatory network required for the proper establishment of cardiovascular lineages by controlling the differentiation timing of mesodermal progenitors. As a means to accomplish this, we propose to 1) Validate and study the developmental mechanisms of transcriptional disruption of cell fate decisions in the cardiogenic mesoderm 2) Study the cellular and mechanistic basis for the severe hypoplastic cardiac defects caused by disruption in early hh singaling. These data will be integrated as a means to understand not only the mechanism by which hh controls early mesodermal patterning, but to contribute foundational knowledge towards the elucidation of CHD etiology by providing a novel mechanism for hypoplastic cardiac phenotypes."
"9470368","ABSTRACT  Integrating information from different senses is critical to navigating the world around us. Many everyday tasks, like reaching for a ringing phone, require attributing features from different senses to the same object, and psychophysical studies show that a variety of species, including both primates and rodents, optimally combine information from different senses in the face of noise. How the brain achieves these feats remains to be understood.  Primary sensory cortical areas, which represent the first stage of cortical information processing, have long been considered uni-sensory. An emerging alternative view, however, holds that even primary sensory cortical areas participate in multi-sensory integration. Recent work has shown that a variety of multi-sensory interactions occur even in primary sensory cortical areas, and theoretical studies suggest that networks of reciprocally-connected sensory areas may be useful for performing certain multi-sensory computations.  The empirical literature, however, has thus far ignored the role of learning in multi-sensory integration in primary sensory cortical areas, which theoretical studies suggest may be critical. The goal of this proposal is to determine the effect of learning on multi-sensory interactions in primary sensory cortical areas. We will first test the hypothesis that mere experience of cross-sensory statistics modifies multi-sensory responses in primary sensory cortical areas. To test this hypothesis, 2-photon calcium imaging will be used to record neural responses to a panel of somatosensory and auditory stimuli in primary somatosensory cortex (S1) of awake mice. One auditory stimulus will then be repeatedly paired with one whisker stimulus over the course of several days, after which responses to the full panel of stimuli will be recorded again. In particular, repeated pairing may cause S1 responses to the paired tone to more closely resemble S1 responses to the paired whisker stimulus. We will also test the hypothesis that repeated pairing of stimuli of different sensory modalities has an enhanced effect on multi-sensory activty in primary sensory cortical areas when the paired stimuli predict reward.  These experiments will expand our understanding of how the brain performs multi-sensory integration and contribute to a significant revision of the traditional view of primary sensory areas as as discrete, parallel modules responsible for a single sense modality each, instead expanding our understanding of how primary sensory areas across the brain can coordinate closely to perform certain computations as a whole."

Dr. Sanyahumbi is establishing herself as a young investigator in global pediatric cardi- ology, with the goal of working towards eradication of rheumatic heart disease (RHD). This K01 will provide her with support to achieve the following goals: (1) to become a global expert in RHD (2) to conduct investigations which will im- prove access and adherence to Benzathine Penicillin G (BPG) in people with RHD (3) to implement advanced biostatisti- cal methods in clinical studies, and (4) become an expert in electronic and mobile health technology that will benefit low and middle income countries (LMIC). To achieve these goals, she has assembled a mentoring team comprised of a prima- ry U.S. mentor, Dr. Kristy Murray, who has expertise in epidemiological methods, and a primary LMIC mentor, Dr. Peter Kazembe, who has extensive mentorship and clinical experience in Malawi. Also on her mentorship team are Dr. Mina Hosseinipour, a Malawian resident who is an expert in global research and mentorship, Dr. Craig Sable, a pediatric cardi- ologist with expertise in applying technology in low income settings, Dr. Daniel Penny, Chief of Pediatric Cardiology at BCM-TCH, and the world?s expert on RHD Dr. Jonathan Carapetis. RHD is preventable, yet continues to cause morbidity and mortality in LMICs. Secondary prevention with 4-weekly BPG has been shown to prevent RHD progression and im- prove RHD outcomes, yet previous studies have shown few people with RHD receive an adequate amount of prescribed injections to prevent advancement of disease. This study will (1) determine adherence to BPG by prospectively evaluating adherence to BPG among children with RHD. Dr. Sanyahumbi will also (2) provide a comprehensive assessment of (a) supply side (b) provider, and (c) patient factors affecting BPG access and adherence, thereby identifying targets to im- prove patient outcomes. Finally, the study will use barriers and facilitators identified in this work as a framework to devise a renewed strategy to improve BPG uptake and adherence. Dr. Sanyahumbi has the potential to become a world renowned global researcher. She has structured a training plan that includes didactic courses in a global masters of public health course, complemented by frequent and regular meetings with her mentorship team to discuss directed readings and topics relevant to her research and career development. Her diverse group of global mentors have expertise in mentorship, bio- stastical methods, global health ethics, RHD, and technological interventions in LMIC. She will be a part of the global research environment of BCM-TCH, Baylor-Malawi, and UNC-Malawi, which are all invested in Dr. Sanyahumbi and committed to the success of this research. RHD is a preventable disease that can have devastating consequence. This study will guide a generalizable systematic approach to improve BPG adherence and improve RHD outcomes. In addition, this award would prepare Dr. Sanyahumbi for an independent research career as she will develop an R01 supported trial eval- uating interventions to improve RHD outcomes before the end of this award period."
"9361416","PROJECT SUMMARY The aim of this collaborative U01 project is to develop a novel multiscale modeling framework that takes advantage of the in depth information on cellular functional states provided by single cell data sets. Emerging technologies and analysis methods aimed at high-throughput molecular assays of hundreds to thousands of single cells have enabled an unprecedented view of the heterogeneity, hierarchy and complexity of cellular functional states. There is an unmet need for systematic methods to utilize such information-rich data sets in a multiscale modeling framework. The central innovative idea of our project with broad impact is to realize the full potential of these novel single cell data sets by developing models of cellular functional states and state transitions to bridge the molecular and tissue scales with physiological scale functions. We will focus on the following Cutting Edge Challenge: Novel computational modeling approaches for big data that account for simultaneous sources of data on multiple scales. We will develop the proposed multiscale modeling framework in the context of understanding the control principles governing the coordinated tissue response to injury. Our approach involves explicit accounting of cellular functional states of immune, stromal, endothelial and epithelial cells, and putative molecular processes driving the state transitions, with broad applicability to multiple tissue repair scenarios. The complexity of the tissue repair process makes it difficult, in a purely qualitative analysis, to identify how, to what extent, and at what time the multiscale molecular, cellular and physiological factors contribute to the coordinated control of the entire process. We will focus on the process of liver regeneration as an enabling testbed in order to fully develop, fine tune and illustrate our multiscale modeling approach for broader application and utility. We have recruited a collaborative team of investigators with expertise in computational modeling, high-throughput single cell scale molecular assays, in vivo manipulation, intravital imaging, and non-invasive methods for physiological scale analysis. Our cross-disciplinary project efforts are organized along three Aims: Aim 1 Develop a mathematical framework to model molecular networks and cellular functional states for predicting the cellular scale impact of molecular mechanisms identified by single cell data sets. Aim 2 Integrate the molecular and cellular network model with a model of spatial tissue microarchitecture and metabolic capacity to predict physiological consequences of response to liver injury. Aim 3 Evaluate and experimentally test the multiscale model for key mechanisms and dynamic shifts in network balances that provide insights into the control principles of the regenerative response to injury in the liver. Successful completion of the aims will yield an optimized approach for utilizing single cell data sets in multiscale modeling. We will actively participate in the Multiscale Modeling Consortium working groups, including Committee on Credible Practice of Modeling & Simulation in Healthcare, Multiscale Systems Biology, Model and Data Sharing, and Clinical and Translational Issues."
"9417737","PROJECT SUMMARY At least 37% of patients treated in the emergency department (ED) are discharged without a definitive diagnosis, thus leaving the encounter with diagnostic uncertainty. A recent national survey of medical trainees found that 99% of trainees had experienced challenges discharging patients with diagnostic uncertainty, and 51% wanted formal communication training regarding uncertainty. Transitions of care are high-risk periods for patient safety, and effective communication between providers and patients is essential to promote patient safety during care transitions. Approaches for educating trainees and establishing competency around effective communication during diagnostic uncertainty are needed to improve the quality of communication at ED discharge, the most common transition of care. Simulation based mastery learning (SBML) is a competency-based educational approach that allows learners to develop skills through deliberate practice, resulting in mastery with little variation in outcomes. SBML is most often employed to develop mastery in medical procedures and has been shown to improve patient care practices. SBML offers a novel approach to developing and testing communication competency among medical trainees. The specific aims of this work are: SA1) To define key principles of uncertainty communication competency, SA2) To develop a simulation-based mastery learning curriculum to teach effective patient communication regarding diagnostic uncertainty and SA3) To test the efficacy of a simulation-based mastery learning curriculum in establishing competency in communication of diagnostic uncertainty among resident physicians. This work will be guided by an expert panel composed of patients and experts in patient communication, education, health literacy, diagnostic uncertainty, and simulation. Results and tools for implementing the SBML curriculum will be disseminated in the Communicating About Diagnostic Uncertainty (CADU) toolkit, with tools targeted to residency program directors and other education leaders via national list-serves. This project has potential to significantly impact the training and competency of providers in navigating safe and effective discharge communication for over one third of patients discharged from the emergency department."
"9341383","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Clinical decision support (CDS) tools are designed to help healthcare providers make better decisions. Significant and mounting evidence suggests that CDS, when used effectively, can improve health care quality, safety, and effectiveness (2-7). Indeed, a good part of the promise of the electronic health record (EHR) to improve patient care relative to a paper-based healthcare ecosystem rests upon CDS. When CDS works well, healthcare providers can come to depend on it. However, we have identified a number of instances where CDS interventions malfunctioned and either stopped providing correct alerts or began providing incorrect alerts. In many cases, these malfunctions persisted for a long period of time and in some cases, they led to patient harm.      We propose a novel anomaly-detection-based method for identifying malfunctions in CDS systems so that they can be corrected. Such approaches have been used in other industries to identify deviations from expected behavior, such as credit card fraud or computer network intrusion detection, but never previously applied to the problem of CDS function and failure.     In preliminary work, we have shown that even simple anomaly-detection-based approaches can identify many CDS malfunctions. In the proposed project, we will extend these methods to improve their sensitivity and specificity and validate them at three sites: Brigham and Women's Hospital, The Ohio State University Medical Center and the University of Texas. We will also conduct a qualitative assessment and root cause analyses of CDS malfunctions and develop an open-source modular dashboard and alerting system for tracking them.     Our project has three aims: 1) to inventory CDS failures and issues that have occurred in three medical centers and conduct root cause analyses to identify causes, indicators, and potential solutions, 2) to develop and validate generalizable anomaly detection approaches to identifying CDS failures and 3) to create, implement, and test a useful and generalizable CDS dashboard and alert system for real-time monitoring for CDS anomalies."
"9377508","PROJECT SUMMARY  A toxic stress response can result from exposure to extreme stressors in early childhood, such as poverty, violence or parental mental illness. Persistent elevation of the stress response system causes physiological disruptions that can result in alterations to brain architecture and neuroendocrine, immune, metabolic and cardiovascular functioning. Studies from animals and maltreated children demonstrate that the presence of a nurturing caregiver can buffer against the physiological disruptions associated with a toxic stress response; however, the specific positive caregiving characteristics that best promote a protective relationship in humans remain largely unexplored, particularly in families living in high-risk environments. Framed by an ecobiodevelopmental model, the proposed study employs a cross-sectional design to describe and examine relationships among past maternal experiences with caregiving, current caregiving patterns, and children's indicators of a toxic stress response in a multiethnic, urban sample of maternal-child dyads with children at early school age.  The first aim of this study is to describe physiological (hair cortisol, salivary c-reactive protein and inflammatory cytokines, blood pressure), health (body mass index, growth delay) and behavioral (internalizing and externalizing behaviors) indicators of a toxic stress response in children. The second aim of this study is to describe maternal caregiving characteristics in the sample, including past maternal experiences with caregiving (adverse childhood experiences, family strengths) and current caregiving patterns (parental reflective functioning, parenting behaviors). The third aim is to examine correlations among past maternal experiences with caregiving, current caregiving patterns, and indicators of a toxic stress response in children. The results of this study will provide essential preliminary data to support future studies designed to examine causal relationships between maternal characteristics and indicators of a toxic stress response in children, and may inform the development of interventions aiming to promote health and reduce disparities within families at risk for toxic stress. The proposed training plan includes coursework and a variety of scholarly and research activities to establish a strong foundation in nursing science and concepts related to the study, including maternal-child relationships, health disparities and social determinants of health. The training plan also includes specific experiences designed to promote extensive knowledge of the stress response system and develop my expertise in research methods, especially with complex families living in challenging community environments. Aligned with NINR's strategic plan to promote health and reduce disparities in minority and underserved populations, the proposed study and training plan will provide an essential foundation for a career in nursing research focused on investigating protective factors for toxic stress in families living with adversity."
"9397812","PROJECT SUMMARY Cancer is the leading cause of death among Asian Americans, and mortality from colorectal cancer (CRC) is ranked as the second most common in cancer deaths among Asian Americans. However, recent data show that CRC screening rates are substantially lower for Chinese and Korean Americans (CKAs) compared with other racial/ethnic groups. To date, a small number of community-based studies have reported on the use of single level (participant level only) interventions to increase CRC screening rates among CKAs; however, very little is known about the impact of multi-level (patient-oriented and provider-oriented) interventions on CRC screening adherence among CKA patients in primary care setting. Furthermore, our preliminary data indicate physician's recommendation as the strongest facilitator of CRC screening among CKAs. Thus, the primary objective of the study is to address this important knowledge gap by conducting a randomized controlled trial to determine the impact of a multi-level culturally-sensitive decision support intervention on CRC screening adherence among 400 CKA primary care patients. Previous studies found that facilitating patient decision-making through decision support and providing patient navigation can increase CRC screening among diverse primary care patients. We will culturally adapt existing evidence- based decision support navigation intervention (CA-DSNI) and test its efficacy among 200 CKA men and 200 CKA women aged 50 to 75 eligible for CRC screening. We will recruit the participants from primary care physicians (PCPs) clinics. The study is designed to compare CRC screening outcomes between the CA-DSNI and the Advanced Control (AC). Those randomized to the AC will receive an informational booklet, a stool blood test kit and a reminder by mail. Those randomized to the CA-DSNI will receive everything the AC receives. Additionally, we will provide decision support and navigation contacts to participants, develop an individualized screening plan using a theory-based online Decision Counseling Program, share the plan with the participants' PCPs, and have PCPs to encourage the screening to participants. Using outcomes data collected by survey and medical record review, we will: (1) determine overall CRC screening adherence in the CA-DSNI vs. the AC; (2) measure change in CRC screening decision stage in the CA-DSNI vs. the AC; and (3) Assess CRC screening test-specific (stool blood test vs. colonoscopy) adherence in the CA-DSNI vs. the AC. Additionally, we will evaluate intervention reach, effectiveness, adoption, implementation, and maintenance using interview data. IMPACT: This study represents the first instance in which CA-DSNI will be used with CKAs in primary care practice settings to address a significant cancer disparity. With growing need for linguistically and culturally competent care, more decision support, language facilitation, and navigation efforts may come into care settings. Therefore, having tested interventions ready for the target population will be timely, and medical systems may benefit from having multilevel best practices known and tested for CKAs."
"9470985","Multiple sclerosis (MS), an inflammatory demyelinating disease of the central nervous system (CNS), is the most common cause of non-traumatic neurological disability in young adults in the Western Hemisphere. Significant progress has been made in the development of disease modifying therapies (DMT) that decrease the frequency of clinical MS relapses by blocking or depleting pathogenic lymphocytes. However, none of the approved DMT are curative, and none are effective in all patients. There are no treatments that slow, or reverse, progressive forms of MS. The current proposal is based on the contention that myeloid cells, and the factors that modulate them, should be considered as candidate therapeutic targets for the treatment of relapsing or progressive forms of MS that are unresponsive to currently used DMT. Myeloid cells (including macrophages, dendritic cells and microglia) comprise a major component of the neuroinflammatory infiltrates in patients with MS and in mice with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE, widely used as an animal model of MS). Abnormalities of myeloid cells have been documented in relapsing-remitting as well as progressive forms of MS. The overall goal of this proposal is to investigate the characteristics of the myeloid cells that accumulate in the central nervous system (CNS) during different stages of autoimmune demyelinating disease. Bone marrow derived macrophages have been broadly classified as pro-inflammatory M1 cells that express inducible nitric synthase (iNOS), and reparative M2 cells that express arginase-1 (Arg1). Our preliminary studies show that the phenotypes of CNS-infiltrating myeloid cells evolve with the progression and remission of EAE. During the preclinical stage, a significant percentage of CNS myeloid cells express iNOS, but none express Arg1. At clinical onset, iNOS+Arg1+ double positive and Arg1+ single positive myeloid cells appear in CNS infiltrates. As mice enter the remission phase only Arg1+ single positive myeloid cells remain. In Aim 1 we will use a panel of genetically engineered mice to elucidate the pathways that drive iNOS+ versus Arg1+ myeloid cell polarization in the inflamed CNS during EAE. In Aims 2 and 3 we will characterize the transcriptomes and biological properties of the CNS-infiltrating myeloid subsets, and determine the clinical and pathological consequences of depleting, skewing or blocking the functions of Arg1+ or iNOS+ CNS myeloid cells, respectively. In Aim 4 we will investigate the density and distribution of myeloid cell subsets in a panel of active, chronic active and relapsing MS lesions in autopsied human brain sections. We are hopeful that this research will ultimately lead to the development of novel MS therapies that suppress pathogenic myeloid subsets, while enhancing reparative subsets, with the goal of mitigating, and even reversing, disability in individuals with relapsing-remitting and progressive forms of MS."
"9417330","UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA ALZHEIMER?S DISEASE CORE CENTER ABSTRACT: REVISION TO CREATE A NEW GENETICS CORE (CORE H) ADCC Director and Principal Investigator: John Q. Trojanowski, MD, PhD Genetics Core Leader: Vivianna Van Deerlin, MD, PhD; Co-Leader: Gerard Schellenberg, PhD This is an application for a revision of the University of Pennsylvania (Penn) Alzheimer Disease Core Center (ADCC) to establish an independent Genetics Core (Core H). We propose to create a Genetics Core which will enhance and expand the genetics activities of the Penn ADCC. The focus of the Penn ADCC is to develop a mechanistic understanding of the still evolving complexity of Alzheimer disease (AD) and related dementias (ADRD) by studying the spectrum of disease from earliest onset through progressive stages of disease and ultimately at autopsy. Genetic factors play a critical role in the risk for AD as well as related dementias (RD) including Lewy body dementia and frontotemporal degeneration, which share common mechanisms of neurodegeneration with AD. Furthermore, many patients have more than one clinical or pathologic phenotype and 20-30% of patients with a clinical diagnosis of AD do not have AD pathology, but instead represent a RD. Therefore, the proposed Genetics Core will support the mission of the Penn ADCC by providing the necessary resources, including the leadership and genetics expertise of Vivianna Van Deerlin and Gerard Schellenberg, to conduct and support molecular genetics research of ADRD in collaboration with the existing Cores. To this end, the Specific Aims of Core H are to: 1) Serve as a repository for DNA collected from Clinical Core B participants and autopsy brains characterized in Neuropathology Core D. Collected samples will undergo quality control and ancestry measures and will be available for use by Penn investigators and external collaborators, including shipment to NCRAD; 2) Genotype risk factor variants associated with ADRD in the Clinical Core B cohort of ADRD, MCI, and control subjects to use in Penn studies as covariates, including APOE and other previously identified risk factor loci using a variety of approaches. In addition, perform genetic analysis of genes associated with hereditary neurodegenerative diseases in ADRD subjects; 3) Serve as a centralized resource for storage and handling of genetic and sample data in conjunction with the Data Management, Bioinformatics and Biostatistics Core C; 4) Contribute to patient and community education efforts of the Outreach and Recruitment Core E by providing genetic counseling services to Clinical Core B participants and to training activities of Research Education Core F as they relate to genetics and biospecimen collection education. In summary, this proposed Genetics Core H will interact with all existing cores as well as the recently submitted Biomarker Core G thereby augmenting the genetics activities and extending the aims of the Penn ADCC as a whole."
"9377488","Project Summary/Abstract  Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) ranks among the 7th and 10th most common cancer among men and women respectively, with an estimated 61,500 new cases and 14,000 deaths in 2015. Specifically, clear-cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) accounts for approximately 70% of renal malignancies among adults.  Extensive research has been conducted on understanding the genetic alterations underlying the pathological features of ccRCC. Early and more recent studies have shown that the most common mutation to occur within ccRCC patients is the inactivation of the tumor suppressor gene, VHL. Such discoveries have led to the generation of targeted therapies that are directed toward VEGF (or its receptor) and mTOR. However, responses of primary ccRCC tumors to theses agents are variable. As such, the need to discover alternative and efficient molecular targets for targeted drug therapy is essential. Our group has generated a novel genetically engineered murine model (GEMM) of ccRCC that shares histology to ccRCC patients. I will utilize this model as a platform to investigate the molecular interactions between HIF? subunits and the proto-oncogene, MYC. I hypothesize that HIF1? and HIF2? (H1H2) and HIF2? (H2) expressing ccRCC cells differentially regulate MYC's transcriptional activity and chromatin localization throughout the genome. Additionally, I hypothesize that the overexpression of MYC confers additional stability to HIF? subunits despite the loss of Vhl. Utilizing cell lines generated from our GEMM ccRCC model and Next Generation Sequencing analysis (RNA-seq and ChIP-seq), I will set out to interrogate the following aims: 1) Investigate whether MYC's transcriptional activity is differentially altered between ccRCC cells expressing H1H2 versus H2 only and 2) Determine how MYC positively regulates HIF1? and HIF2? levels within ccRCC.!"
"9456502","Project Summary/Abstract Sexual minority women (SMW; lesbian, bisexual) experience substantial health disparities, including significantly higher rates of hazardous drinking, depression, and poor self-reported health compared to heterosexual women. However, there is a dearth of research examining resiliency factors and how these factors might vary by race/ethnicity among SMW. The Institute of Medicine (IOM) challenged researchers to examine factors that foster resilience among SMW including examining differences by race and ethnicity and exploring the positive impact on sexual minority (SM) health of the legal recognition of same-sex marriage. Studies have found strong associations between supportive policies, such as marriage recognition, and improved health outcomes among sexual minorities. However, there are gaps in understanding specific psycho-social factors may explain the impact of policies on SM health outcomes. To address these gaps in knowledge, we will draw on minority stress, intersectionality, and social-ecological frameworks and a mixed-methods research design to identify and assess factors that underlie the effect of marriage recognition on health and to examine relationships between these factors and three health outcomes among SMW: hazardous drinking, depression, and poor general health. Several key innovations ensure the success and high impact of this project. First, the proposed project leverages innovative methods from a currently funded project (R01 DA036606; Drabble & Trocki, multiple-PIs), which uses respondent-driven sampling (RDS) based on population-based seeds from the National Alcohol Survey (NAS) to collect data nationwide from a large and diverse population of approximately 1000 SMW. Second, by creating measures to describe how marriage recognition may influence health, our study contributes to the sparse but urgently needed research on resiliency among SMW. Third, the study contributes to emerging understanding of the impact of marriage recognition on health outcomes, with a special focus on differences in risk by race/ethnicity and how such risks may be attenuated by other risk/protective factors at individual, interpersonal, community, and sociopolitical levels. Finally, the study capitalizes on the recent historic national change in laws that now recognize same-sex marriage in all states, affording a timely opportunity to develop and test new scales designed to investigate how marriage recognition influences health outcomes among racially and ethnically diverse SMW. To do so, we will test the following aims: 1) Develop new measures to assess factors that underlie the impact of marriage recognition, using in-depth qualitative interviews with approximately 32 diverse SMW. 2) Assess the psychometric properties of the new measures among approximately 500-600 SMW, using item analysis and confirmatory factor analysis. 3) Examine the predictive value of these novel SMW-specific measures on hazardous drinking, depression and self-reported health, with specific focus on racial/ethnic differences. We will merge new data with previously collected data, which include rich demographic, risk and resiliency data from the same participants. Findings will be used in future studies with population-based and volunteer samples to inform prevention and intervention strategies aimed and building resiliency and reducing health disparities among SMW."
"9424465","Project Abstract  Medical Therapy Units (MTUs) are multidisciplinary county clinics that provide comprehensive medical management to children with special health care needs for durable medical equipment, orthotics, and therapy services. Unfortunately for children living in rural and underserved communities, MTU specialty care is often difficult to access because the most qualified specialist physicians to lead these encounters (pediatric physiatrists), are regionalized at large urban centers. As a result, these children are left to receive care in one of three ways: first, some pediatric physiatrists travel long distances to provide care in the local community MTU; second, some county MTUs hire non-specialist providers to provide the care, despite the fact that these providers lack expertise in the care of children with special health care needs; and third, some families and children are left with no other option but to travel long distances to receive care at a regionalized, urban MTU.  In order to address the travel burdens and barriers to care, as well as to increase the quality of care provided to these children, we will implement a model of care using telemedicine to deliver pediatric physiatrist medical direction to MTUs located in rural and underserved communities. The objective of this application is to prospectively compare outcomes from our telemedicine-based model of care to two cohorts: patients who receive in-person pediatric physiatrist medical direction (the ?gold standard?) and patients who receive medical oversight from non-specialist community providers.  First, we hypothesize that when pediatric physiatrists use telemedicine to provide medical direction, parents/guardians of children will be equally satisfied with care received compared to parents/guardians of children who receive in-person care by pediatric physiatrists, and more satisfied than parents/guardians of children who receive care by non-specialist community providers. Second, we hypothesize that when pediatric physiatrists use telemedicine to provide medical direction, children will have equal adherence to an evidence- based hip surveillance program compared to children who receive in-person care by pediatric physiatrists, and better adherence to the hip surveillance program than children who receive care by non-specialist community providers. Third, we hypothesize that when pediatric physiatrists use telemedicine to provide medical direction to children with special health care needs living in rural and underserved communities, there will be significant cost savings compared to when pediatric physiatrists have to travel to distant MTUs and to when care is provided by non-specialist community providers.  Our work is significant because we expect that this model of care will result in improved access, increased levels of patient-centeredness, higher quality of care, and will simultaneously reduce overall costs of care. We also expect that this model will be scalable and will be used by similar programs treating children with special health care needs throughout the country. 1"
"9377493","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Amblyopia is a developmental visual disorder due to abnormal binocular input during an early critical period. It is characterized by low level deficis in acuity, contrast sensitivity, orientation discrimination, as well higher- level deficits in formand motion processing. Abnormalities have been found in V1 and V2, but fail to account for perceptual deficits implying further deficits must downstream. Our central hypothesis is that amblyopia stems from small deficits in early visual areas that are magnified downstream due to abnormal signal integration. To test this hypothesis, we will perform a series of behavior and physiology experiments to test both low and high level amblyopic deficits. We predict that amblyopic animals will be impaired on behavior tasks that require discrimination between global form stimuli. Neural responses to low-level grating stimuli will show deficits more severe than what has been reported in V1 and V2, more similar to perceptual deficits. Responses to high-level stimuli will exhibit shape selectivity, but to a more broad degree for amblyopic animals compared to visually normal controls. These experiments are critical to the overall understanding of the neural basis of amblyopia."
"9318144","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal seeks support for the UMass Worcester Prevention Research Center (UMW-PRC), initially funded by the CDC in 2009 as a developmental PRC. Funding will support the growth and enhancement of a comprehensive core infrastructure that fosters applied public health research partnerships with state and local departments of public health and numerous community partners. Our faculty conduct intervention research, implementation research and public health practice-based research that targets the CDC Winnable Battles of nutrition, physical activity and obesity in the Worcester, MA area. The UMW-PRC has six priority areas: racial and ethnic health disparities, the built environment and systems, comorbid obesity and mental health, child and adolescent health, worksite health promotion, and community-clinical linkages. In the proposed funding cycle, the UMW-PRC will further its role as 1) an institutional leader in applied public health research, 2) an integral part of the collaborative public health system within Worcester, MA, 3) a statewide resource for applied public health research expertise, and 4) a national model for bidirectional applied public health research that integrates academic medicine, public health, health care and communities. This will be accomplished through innovations in each of the PRC programmatic components: administration and infrastructure, community engagement and technical assistance, communication and dissemination, training, and evaluation. Building from this infrastructure, our proposed applied public health prevention research project will be implemented in the racial/ethnically diverse Union Hill neighborhood, which the City of Worcester has prioritized for revitalization due to its high rates of crime, poverty and unemployment, deteriorating built environment, and high chronic disease burden. Targeted resource investments aim to improve crime and safety and economic development. Simultaneously, Union Hill will be targeted by a Massachusetts Department of Public Health (MDPH) Mass in Motion/Community Transformation Grant (MiM- CTG) to implement public policy and environmental improvements to promote physical activity and healthy eating and reduce obesity. Perceived social norms, limited parental efficacy to influence child obesogenic behaviors and limited parenting skills related to child obesogenic behaviors may reduce the impact of built environment interventions. The proposed study will test the impact of the built environment intervention plus a family-focused community health worker (CHW)-delivered component to improve ability of families to navigate their environment and promote healthy eating and activity through improvements in social norms, parental efficacy, and parenting skills, compared to the built environment intervention plus an attention control CHW- delivered component. The study uses a quasi-experimental design to assess impact on child and parent diet, physical activity and BMI. We will use MDPH statewide child BMI data to compare impact of the combined built environment interventions in Union Hill to the MiM-CTG program only in comparable MA urban communities."
"9445614","Project Summary/Abstract  Binge eating disorder (BED), a formal DSM-5 diagnosis, is a prevalent, refractory, and serious health problem experienced by men and women and with heightened psychiatric and medical comorbidity. Although BED is associated strongly with obesity, BED is distributed across weight categories. Nearly all treatment trials for BED have required the presence of co-morbid obesity despite epidemiological estimates that 58% of those with BED are not obese. Current pharmacological treatment options are limited and the sole FDA-approved medication for BED has a ?Limitation of Use? for weight loss and treating obesity. Ideally, an optimal pharmacological approach for BED would reduce binge eating in those with and without obesity, and have the added benefit of reducing weight in those with co-morbid obesity.  The combined use of naltrexone HCI and bupropion HCI (NB) was developed to target alterations in the hypothalamic melanocortin system and the brain reward system, with the two compounds hypothesized to work synergistically to reduce food intake. Although NB targets systems highly relevant for those with BED, its efficacy for reducing binge eating is unknown. Our pilot data shows that NB reduces rates of binge eating behavior as well as reduces weight in those with co-morbid BED+obesity. The primary aim is to conduct a double-blind, placebo-controlled parallel group RCT to evaluate the efficacy of NB versus placebo to reduce binge eating in patients with BED, stratified by obesity status (n=50 per cell, n=200 total) for a 12-week treatment period and a 12-month follow-up period. The second primary aim evaluates mechanisms underlying the effect of NB on binge eating. An established human laboratory paradigm will be used to assess eating behaviors including the ability to resist eating preferred high-caloric food and subsequent over-eating. Potential mechanisms involved in both homeostatic and hedonic aspects of eating will be examined. We hypothesize that potential medication-related changes in eating behavior, eating peptides and food craving assessed in the laboratory will mediate clinical outcomes during the 12-week RCT (i.e., rates of binge eating). The third, and exploratory aim, assesses eating and drinking behavior, food craving, and mood `in the field' during the first 6 weeks of NB treatment in a subset of participants (n=60) with the use of an innovative biosensor system. We will examine whether medication-related changes in naturalistic eating behavior relate to clinical outcomes (i.e., rates of binge eating).  This innovative interdisciplinary study will: (1) Provide the first test of the therapeutic potential and related mechanisms of NB for BED in patients with obesity and without obesity. (2) Identify correlates and potential mechanisms underlying the effect of NB on binge eating. Evaluating outcomes with innovative human laboratory and with novel field assessments using wearable biosensors will optimize internal and external validity and provide the most comprehensive multi-modal assessment of any treatment study for BED to date."
"9363982","Project Summary The plasma membrane (PM) forms the physical barrier and functional interface between a cell and its environment. To accommodate this complexity, the functionality of the PM is amplified by compartmentalization into compositionally and functionally distinct lateral domains, of which lipid rafts are the archetypal example. Raft-mediated signal transduction has been extensively implicated in diverse cell functions, with dysregulation contributing to the aberrant signaling in cancer, hyperinflammation, autoimmunity, and cardiovascular disease. Despite this potential impact, a dearth of consistent, quantitative methodologies has prevented clear definition of raft composition or unequivocal mechanistic description of raft function. A recent methodological breakthrough is the direct observation of large-scale ordered domains in plasma membranes isolated from mammalian cells. This system confirms the inherent capacity of mammalian PMs to form raft domains and also provides a robust experimental platform for direct, quantitative investigations into their composition and physical properties. We propose a comprehensive approach combining biophysics, bioinformatics, in silico molecular modeling, and cell biology to characterize the structural determinants and functional consequences of protein partitioning to PM microdomains. Our extensive preliminary data reveal that protein transmembrane domains (TMDs) encompass the necessary determinants for raft affinity. In Aim 1, we will define the general TMD physical features that impart raft affinity, focusing specifically on TMD length and surface area to test the hypothesis that relatively long and thin TMDs have more favorable interactions with ordered membrane microenvironments. Experimental measurements of raft partitioning will be supported by computational modeling and bioinformatics with the ultimate goal of generating a physical model that can identify raft preferring proteins from amino acid sequence. In Aim 2, we will extend the study from single TMDs to evaluate the role of TMD oligomerization in driving raft affinity. Our preliminary data has identified a specific TMD sequence motif that significantly enhances raft phase association. We will evaluate the hypothesis that such enhancement is driven by TMD oligomerization via quantitative evaluation of TMD oligomerization and its effect on raft partitioning in live cells, isolated PMs, and synthetic model systems. The structural details behind these observations will be investigated by atomistic molecular modeling. Finally, we aim to definitively demonstrate raft affinity as a major regulator of subcellular membrane traffic by the experiments proposed in Aim 3. To this end, we have generated a panel of protein variants lacking any sorting determinants except their TMD-encoded raft affinity. For these proteins, PM recycling after endocytosis relies on their partitioning into ordered membrane domains, implying a raft- mediated protein sorting mechanism. The trafficking pathways and molecular machinery underlying this mechanism will be investigated by imaging experiments using the TMD panel as validated probes of raft and non-raft domains. These studies will identify proteins that rely on microdomain association for their function, define the physicochemical nature of this association, and clarify the mechanisms by which PM organization regulates cell physiology. The long-term goal is to facilitate rational design of small molecules that interfere with protein association with microdomains in disease states defined by aberrant PM signal transduction."
"9391610","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Rates of substance use disorders (SUDS) are high among military personnel and veterans. While much research is focused on the acute care of SUDs, the risk of relapse to substance use following treatment is high and attention to continuing care is critical. New continuing care strategies targeting life-style change and improved coping mechanisms are important in facilitating maintenance of abstinence, promoting rehabilitation and functional recovery for veterans with SUDs. Mindfulness-based relapse prevention (MBRP), a manualized treatment integrating cognitive-behavioral relapse prevention therapy with mindfulness practices, has shown promise in continuing care for SUDs. The proposed project will compare MBRP to a 12-Step Facilitation treatment as a continuing care strategy following primary treatment for SUDs. Participants will be randomized to participate in 8-weeks of weekly 90-minute, group-based MBRP or 12-Step Facilitation followed by a 10- month follow-up period with regular assessments of substance use, mood/anxiety symptoms, quality of life and functional outcomes. Two VAMC sites (Charleston and Tuscaloosa) with a history of successful collaboration will work together to recruit an adequate sample size to address the primary study questions within a 4-year period and to ensure generalizability of the results. If this trial demonstrates that MBRP promotes sustained abstinence and improved functional outcomes, this will provide a valuable treatment to facilitate rehabilitation and recovery for veterans with SUDs."
"9393157","This R21 grant responds to RFA-EY-17-001 ?BRAIN Initiative: New Concepts and Early-Stage Research for Large-Scale Recording and Modulation in the Nervous System ?for unique and innovative technologies in an even earlier stage of development ? including new and untested ideas in the initial stages of conceptualization? where preliminary data would not be available?. Electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG) which measures the magnetic fields associated with the neuronal currents are the only tools currently available to noninvasively measure electrical activity in human brain. They provide a wealth of information on brain electrical activity in epilepsy, dementias, autism, depression, stroke, and trauma for clinical diagnosis and surgical planning. Yet the neuronal currents detected by EEG electrodes are confounded by intervening brain, CSF, skull and scalp tissues, while MEG requires superconducting magnetometers and a quiet magnetic environment. Moreover, the signal sources in EEG and MEG are not spatially-encoded per se and pose an inverse problem without a unique solution. While magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) plays a key role in The Brain Initiative with fiber track mapping and functional MRI (fMRI) methods and it aught to be sensitive to EEG/MEG signals, attempts to use MRI to measure neuronal electrical activity have thus far proved inconclusive or null. The MEG signals range from 10-15 to 10-12 Tesla(T) during epileptic spikes, while MRI?s sensitivity to neuronal sources is estimated at only about 10-10 T. Support is sought to develop an entirely new MRI approach to directly measure MEG-modulated MRI signals using a spatial encoding scheme that provides exceptionally high intrinsic signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) and speed. The new method of localization?spectroscopy with linear algebraic modeling or SLAM?uses a greatly-reduced SNR-optimized gradient encoding set to directly localize signals from small volumes of brain tissue that can be arbitrarily segmented and resized post-acquisition, from scout MRI. Tests show that SLAM can deliver an SNR of ?105, yielding a calculated sensitivity of 10-14-10-15T for the brain water signal in ~10ml volumes in ~30ms acquisitions (~30Hz bandwidth). Mechanistically, MEG/EEG modulation of MRI signals arises via the zero/low-frequency dipole-dipole component of the spectral density function, which is directly proportional to the spin-spin relaxation rate, 1/T2. The plan is to continuously apply T2-sensitive SLAM MRI at ~30 Hz to detect MEG/EEG modulations of ~10-14T signals over a meaningful ~30Hz EEG range in healthy human volunteers. Simultaneous MRI-compatible EEG will be used for reference to identify signals, detect artifacts and optimize detection of relevant signals. Studies to detect resting-state, visual- and audio-evoked potentials are planned. If successful, the grant would deliver noninvasive MRI-based localization and sizing of neuronal signal sources which might then be correlated directly with fMRI, fiber-tracking and other MRI metrics."
"9350633","Project Summary RNA modifications are emerging epitranscriptomic markers in regulating gene expression, and are crucial for development and linked to human diseases, such as neuronal disorders and cancers. N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is the most prevalent modification in the messenger RNA (mRNA) and long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) in higher eukaryotes. m6A are dynamically installed and removed on the target RNAs, and can be recognized by various m6A reader proteins (proteins containing YTH domains, or YTH proteins) to regulate the target RNAs through diverse mechanisms, or alter the local RNA structure to fine tune the RNA-protein interactions. How does one single type of modification allow one RNA target to be regulated in diverse ways? What are the signals contributing to the choice of a specific regulatory mechanism for a particular RNA? We hypothesize that a single RNA can exist in multiple ?methylation states? due to the existence of multiple methylation sites and incomplete methylation at each site. The methylation state serves as ?epitranscriptomic code? and may determine fate of the RNA. The methylation states of a single RNA and the mechanistic linkage between methylation states and various m6A-mediated regulation pathways can only be dissected by experimental approaches with both specificity to a defined methylation site and sensitivity of single RNA. However, such experimental approaches are currently unavailable, which hampers our current efforts to understand the role of RNA modifications. To tackle this problem, in Aim 1, we will first develop a suite of imaging platforms with single-RNA sensitivity and single- methylation site specificity. With the unique techniques, we will then focus on studying lncRNA and mRNA systems. In Aim 2, we will investigate whether methylation state of an lncRNA, MALAT1, has impact on its multivalent binding capacity, its subcellular localization, and its recruitment to actively transcribed gene loci to promote splicing. In Aim 3, we will explore how methylation state in an mRNA can influence choice of regulatory pathways at translation or degradation levels, and the strength of m6A-mediate regulation. Our proposed experiments on RNA modification at single-RNA level in vivo will provide valuable mechanistic insight of m6A-mediated regulation in both lncRNA and mRNA systems.  Such pioneer and novel imaging platforms can be also generally adapted to study other RNA modifications."
"9380504","ABSTRACT The overarching objectives of the PRIME Collaborative (Physical Resilience: Indicators and Mechanisms in the Elderly) are to characterize specific resilience phenotypes, elucidate biological mechanisms, and validate clinically valuable predictive tools and measures of physical resilience. The application focuses on resilience in three systems that are central to older adults' overall health: musculoskeletal, cognitive, and immune. The central hypothesis of this application is that resilience to physical stressors is influenced by biological mechanisms at the molecular level. We will examine whether mechanisms associated with one or more of the seven ?Pillars of Aging,? which have been described by the trans-NIH Geroscience Interest Group, underlie a more generalized capacity for recovery that applies across multiple stressor/response scenarios. An inter- professional team of aging researchers from has been assembled to accomplish these objectives; the team represents expertise from six NIA-funded Older American Independence Centers (OAICs) and leverages other existing resources. The PRIME Collaborative team will use a two-phased approach. In Phase 1, workgroups will define specific resilience phenotypes in existing datasets using latent class trajectory analysis of sequential outcome measures following a stressor. The three resilience phenotypes, selected for their over-arching relevance to late life health as well as our team's expertise, are: musculoskeletal recovery after orthopedic surgery, immune recovery after infection, and cognitive recovery after surgery/anesthesia. We will conduct pilot studies to identify novel clinical tests and biomarkers associated with each of these resiliencies. Feasibility and response data from pilot studies will inform the design of a larger cohort study in Phase 2. In the final 6 months of Phase 1, the most promising predictive tests and markers will be selected and will inform two parallel activities in Phase 2. First, a longitudinal cohort study of older patients undergoing elective surgery will be conducted to validate predictors in a more diverse population. The Phase 2 cohort study will also allow us to assess synergy and interactions between different types of predictors (provocative tests, physiologic output measures, biomarkers) and different types of resilience (musculoskeletal, cognitive, immune). Second, biological mechanisms underpinning resilience will be identified using newly developed mouse resilience models, and in vitro human and mouse myotubule systems. These model systems are suitable for intervention studies. The Phase 2 biological studies will be designed to identify pathways related to one or more Pillars of Aging so that they are likely to underpin multiple types of resilience, and suggest therapeutic targets and novel, resilience-bolstering interventions."
"9447282","Project Summary/Abstract Genetically engineered neural stem cells (NSCs) are a promising therapy for the highly aggressive brain cancer Glioblastoma (GBM). Engineered NSCs have unique tumor-homing capacity that allows them to deliver anti-cancer gene products directly into local and invasive GBM foci. Preclinical studies by our group and others have shown tumoricidal NSCs routinely reduce orthotopic GBM xenografts between 70-90% and significantly extend survival of tumor-bearing mice. Yet, these dramatic initial reductions in GBM volumes are not maintained and treatment durability remains a major challenge for NSC-based therapy. GBM escape occurs after treatment with NSCs carrying different therapeutic payloads and in pre-clinical models of both solid and post-surgical GBM. We recently discovered that novel tumor-homing drug delivery vehicles with robust anti- cancer activity can be developed from ?induced neural stem cells? (iNSCs) using cellular reprogramming technology, referred to as transdifferentiation (TD). Tumoricidal iNSC therapy reduced GBM xenografts 230- fold in 4 weeks and more than doubled survival. Similar to wild-type NSC therapy, the tumors were not eradicated and the GBMs re-developed. The events mediating the regrowth of GBMs in response to single- agent NSC/iNSC therapy are unknown. Our results show that transplanted iNSCs drug carriers are cleared from the brain, but repeated intracerebroventricular (ICV) infusion restores carrier levels. We also have evidence that GBM cells become resistant to iNSC-delivered drugs. This allows us to hypothesize that GBM resistance to iNSC therapy can be overcome by repeat administration to address carrier loss and multi-agent iNSC delivery to address tumor resistance. With this grant we propose to test this hypothesis, defining the events that contribute to the dynamic adaption of GBM during NSC treatment and develop strategies to convert the initial tumor kill into sustained GBM suppression. We will investigate carrier clearance, homing, and tumor resistance throughout GBM adaption and recurrence. We will then modulate iNSC therapy through repeated dosing via ICV infusion and delivery of iNSCs carrying multi-drug payloads with the goal of improving treatment durability by overcoming iNSC loss and the emergence of GBM foci that are resistant to single-agent treatments. All testing will be done using our novel surgical resection models of murine-derived GBM cells in immune-competent animals and patient-derived CD133+ human GBM cells to maximize the clinical relevancy of our finding and understand the impact of the immune system on iNSC treatment durability. The results of these studies are essential for creating durable NSC-based tumor therapies capable of producing long-lasting GBM suppression in patient trials."
"9340801","Project Summary CRISPR-Cas loci consist of short DNA repeats separated by equally short sequences (known as spacers) that match the genomes of prokaryotic viruses (phages) and plasmids and confer sequence-based immunity against these elements. Immunity is mediated by small, antisense CRISPR RNA molecules (crRNAs) that are transcribed from spacers and guide CRISPR-associated (Cas) nucleases to the invading nucleic acid for cleavage and destruction. During my post-doctoral studies I pioneered the study of CRISPR-Cas systems to establish the foundations of this bacterial immunity pathway. Using genetics, I determined that CRISPR-Cas systems target DNA molecules in a sequence-specific manner, a study that was key to understand the mechanisms of CRISPR immunity at the molecular level. This finding predicted the existence of RNA- programmable Cas nucleases and their current applications to genome editing. Upon plasmid or phage infection, CRISPR-Cas system incorporate new spacer sequences that match the genome of the invader. This process records a memory of the infection that is subsequently used to generate the crRNA guides for the Cas nucleases. While the molecular mechanisms behind the recognition and cleavage of target sequences by the Cas nucleases are well understood, how the host can acquire new spacers; i.e. the immunization phase of the CRISPR-Cas immune response, is still a mystery. In this proposal I plan to study how the prokaryotic host acquires new spacer sequences from its invaders, using a combination of molecular genetics and next-generation sequencing approaches. Fundamental questions such as (i) how autoimmunity, or the acquisition of spacers from the host chromosome, is prevented; (ii) how fast is the immunization process compared to the viral infectious cycle; (iii) which other cellular pathways, if any, assist CRISPR immunization; (iv) how new spacer sequences are sampled from the invader's genome; and (v) how the immunization process affects the evolution of the host population; are not yet answered. The proposed studies will substantially advance our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying CRISPR-Cas immunization and the impact that these loci have on the ecology and evolution of prokaryotes organisms that harbor them. In addition, our experiments will require or allow us to engineer CRISPR-Cas systems that perform spacer acquisition with high frequency. Such systems will facilitate the development of technologies with applications that require the recording of specific cellular events into a specific genomic locus to enable researchers following long cellular histories. Thus the proposed studies could provide new ground to exploit CRISPR immunization for revolutionary biotechnological and/or therapeutic purposes."

We collaborate with the Texas Health and Human Services Commission, the Florida  Agency for Health Care Administration, the Florida Healthy Kids Program which oversees CHIP, two Texas  Medicaid Managed Care Plans and their health system partners, two dental plans, the OneFlorida Clinical  Data Research Network, and two External Quality Review Organization (EQRO) partners. These  collaborators joined to form the Child Health Quality (CHeQ) Partnership. We also are partnering with  PEDSnet, a national network of children's hospitals and providers, who will participate in validation for  measure refinements that incorporate electronic health record (EHR) data. Through our collaboration  experiences, we identified implementation and dissemination opportunities for the following measure sets: 1)  Linkage Between Dental Treatment and Dental Prevention and 2) Safe and Judicious Antipsychotic Use in  Children and Adolescents. UF-ICHP has a16-year history in both states in measuring children's quality of  care (QOC) and evaluating performance improvement projects. We house fully identified Medicaid and CHIP  health care data for all enrolled children from 2007 to the present that are refreshed monthly. Further, we  house EHR data in a central repository called the OneFlorida Data Trust for 1.2M or 49% of all children in  Florida Medicaid and CHIP, which will be used to enhance the Antipsychotic Use Measure set with metabolic  screening and monitoring lab results. We are leveraging our substantial infrastructure and experience to  conduct the proposed project and address the required goals as specified in RFA-HS-16-002. The two goals  of this project are to test the feasibility and usability of the selected measure sets through: 1) field testing;  refining; collecting data, including testing the efficient collection of valuable clinical data from EHRs; and  reporting on the measures; and 2) translating the results into QI goals and multi-level performance  improvement projects. In addition, we will implement and disseminate leading-edge methods to evaluate and  compare quality of care at multiple levels, including the state, health plan, and provider levels. A toolkit,  based on lessons learned, that provides practical guidance on how best to design and analyze quality of care  data at multiple levels and how to make valid comparisons within and across levels will be developed."
"9358414","Project Summary/Abstract  The long-term goal of our research program is to develop the scientific evidence needed to bring competency- based evaluation of surgical skills to orthopedics. The objective of this application is to provide the orthopedic training community with scientifically defendable criteria for critical orthopedic surgical skills at three key developmental points in surgical residency: ready to operate, ready to lead a surgery supervised by faculty, and ready for independent practice. The central hypothesis of this project is that orthopedic surgical skill competence can be objectively, quantitatively, and reliably measured from surgical results that impact patient safety. This hypothesis is based on previous multi-institutional simulation studies conducted with residency programs throughout the Midwest region. The proposed research explores training and assessment programs with several novel surgical simulators. It will also explore ground-breaking analysis techniques for assessing operating room performance from surgical radiographs and from computational, image-based, 3D model reconstruction. This project further expands previous work to more residency programs and to two national ortho- pedic organizations: the Orthopedic Trauma Association, which offers training programs to over a hundred residents sev- eral times a year, and to the American Board of Orthopedic Surgeons, which reviews the credentials and skills of 900 or- thopedic surgeons each year, certifying many to become official diplomates of ABOS.  The participation of these national organizations, which provide a large number of potential research participants, creates the opportunity for achieving exciting new research goals, including these three specific aims. Specific Aim 1 is to measure orthopedic trauma surgery skill through surgical results. The working hypothesis for this aim is that sur- gical skill in orthopedic trauma can be measured by analyzing radiographic images associated with a surgery. Specific Aim 2 is to develop simulator-based training programs that improve surgical results. The working hypothesis is that residents who practice key skills until achieving proficiency will perform better in the operating room than residents with- out training. Specific Aim 3 is to define simulator-based assessments that generalize to clinical performance. The working hypothesis is that simulator assessment measurements will discriminate among levels of surgical skill and will also generalize across surgical tasks and between simulation and clinical practice.  The proposed research will provide a safe environment for orthopedic surgeons to acquire valuable experience without putting patients at risk. It will also help to establish reliable measures of clinical performance competency and their potential use for credentialing and certification. Finally, as new simulation capabilities become available over the ensuing years, this work will have successfully shown the way from development to changing practice."
"9439996","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT A Randomized Controlled Trial of a Community-Based Chronic Pain Self-Management Program in West Virginia  Chronic pain (CP) affects 1 in 3 US adults and costs up to $635 billion annually in medical costs and lost work productivity. The impact of CP is worse in people with both CP and comorbid chronic diseases such as arthritis, diabetes, and heart disease. Use of opioid medications for CP has risen in the US, and opioid overdose deaths have quadrupled, yet with no overall change in pain. Although one-third of US adults have CP, there is a lack of affordable, non- pharmacological, evidence-based, community-delivered interventions for people with CP. Thus, there is a vital need to rigorously test more interventions that can be brought to scale and widely disseminated in the US.  One program, the Chronic Pain Self-Management Program (CPSMP), provides short-term improvements in pain but its long-term effects (i.e., at 1 year) have not been evaluated. This study will examine the long-term effects of CPSMP in the medically underserved state of West Virginia (WV). With one of the worst health profiles in the US, WV has the highest rates of arthritis, diabetes, heart disease, and drug overdose deaths, and therefore has a compelling need for the CPSMP. The objectives of this community-engaged, randomized, wait-list controlled study are to: 1) determine the short- (12 and 24 weeks) and long-term (52 weeks) effectiveness of the 6-week CPSMP in adults with CP in WV; 2) evaluate the Reach (number of participants, completers), Effectiveness (outcomes), Adoption (number of sites, leaders, trainings), Implementation (fidelity), and Maintenance (satisfaction, continuation) of CPSMP using the RE-AIM Framework; and 3) disseminate the results to key stakeholders including evidence-based organizations, public health practitioners/researchers, and healthcare providers.  The study will enroll 128 participants in 16 workshops at 8 community-based sites in 2 counties in WV, Greenbrier (rural) and Wood (urban). Participants will attend free, 2.5-hour weekly sessions for 6 weeks. Two trained leaders will facilitate group discussions on managing pain, emotions, depression, fatigue, and sleep; proper exercise, nutrition, and medication use; weight management; strategies for effective communication with healthcare professionals; evaluating treatments; and pacing/planning. Self-reported, performance-based, and physiological data will be collected at baseline and 12, 24, and 52 weeks after the intervention ends. The primary outcomes are pain (severity, quality, interference, medication use), mental health (mood, anxiety, catastrophizing), function (self-efficacy, coping, health-related quality of life, sleep, fatigue, communication, physical activity), healthcare utilization, missed work days, and gait speed. Secondary outcomes include A1C and cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and body mass index."
"9336859","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is a deadly and relatively common form of brain cancer. Despite poor prognoses, few meaningful treatment options are available to GBM patients. Treatment resistance and severe malignancy are driven in part by a subpopulation of stem cells that reside within the tumor termed glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs). The severe malignancy associated with GSCs is encouraged by the unique vascular niche in which they reside. The formation of the tumor niche is instigated by factors released by GSCs, and, in turn, cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions in the niche drive GSC growth and invasion. Recent evidence is beginning to emerge that activity-dependent mechanisms also perturb GSC properties. Yet, very little is still known about how electrical crosstalk within the tumor niche effects GSC malignant features and this proposal will address this substantial gap in knowledge. The first aim is to determine the intrinsic membrane properties and channels that are aberrantly expressed by GSCs. Using single-cell patch-clamping, electrophysiological signatures of individual dissociated GSCs will be characterized. These properties will be further correlated with membrane channel expression levels using single-cell RT-PCR to gain an understanding of the physiological differences between GSCs and neural cells and how these differences may respond to extrinsic network signals. The second Aim will address how surrounding neural activity affects these physiological features as well as growth and migration of GSCs. GSCs will be cocultured on organotypic brain slices to create an ex vivo model of the GSC-neuron interactive environment, and surrounding cortical areas will be stimulated or silenced using pharmacological or optogenetic modulation. Surrounding neural activity is likely to modulate GSC membrane properties and rates of proliferation and migration. This proposal will test a novel niche factor that likely plays an important role in tumor propagation, and these results may direct innovative therapeutic interventions for the treatment of GBM."
"9463844","Project Summary Developing an Automated Yeast Dissection System for Aging Research  Aging is the single greatest risk factor for diseases that are principal causes of mortality. The objectives of aging research are to discover key genes and pathways related to aging that may eventually contribute to retardation of aging and a delay in the onset of age-associated diseases. The budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae has been a powerful model for the study of aging and has enabled significant contributions to our understanding of basic mechanisms of aging in eukaryotic cells. However, traditional assays of yeast aging, including microdissection methods, have technical challenges; for instance, the methods are low-throughput and the experimental procedures are laborious. An experiment typically lasts several weeks or months, and requires overnight storage of the assayed cells at a refrigerator to pause replication throughout the course of experiment. This tedious procedure has substantially hindered progress in the field of aging research. We have developed an innovative and highly effective microfluidic platform for continuous and automatic dissection of daughter cells without disturbing mother cells as they bud. The platform allows an automated whole-lifespan tracking with high spatiotemporal resolution and large-scale quantification of single yeast cells, resulting in significant reduction of labor, time, and cost. In addition, the high-resolution florescence imaging of yeast cells grown in constant and dynamically changing environments offers the ability to examine the dynamics of gene expression and signaling networks in a high-throughput manner. The quantity and types of data acquired by this platform are impossible with the traditional assay methods. Herein, we propose to develop automated dissection platform that enable fast and high-throughput studies of yeast aging. We will validate the reliability and capability of the proposed platform We propose to validate the prototype automated dissection platform for two important assays in yeast aging research: determination of replicative lifespan for mutants in an automated and unattended fashion, and continuous tracking the changes in abundance and cellular localization for specific GFP fusion proteins during the entire aging process. Longer term plan of this proposal is to commercialize a fully automation benchtop system for high-throughput studies of cellular aging."

"9420095","Exposure to hydrochloric acid (HCl) can cause severe acute and chronic, potentially lethal, pulmonary injury. Because of its frequent and multiple uses, the incidence of exposure to HCl has been increasing. Even though there is considerable amount of data on the acute effects of HCl, much less is known about the more severe, potentially lethal chronic sequels of exposure to HCl and no antidotes exist to the most dangerous, irreversible and potentially lethal of these effects, namely pulmonary fibrosis. Following initial, reversible inflammation, activation of pro-fibrotic pathways (e.g., ERK1/2., AKT) lead to fibroblast activation, extracellular matrix deposition and pulmonary fibrosis. Recently, it was reported that heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) is also upregulated in pulmonary fibrosis. We therefore hypothesized that HSP90 inhibitors may prove useful as countermeasures against HCl-induced chronic lung injury and pulmonary fibrosis. Our preliminary studies demonstrate that a single intra-tracheal instillation of HCl causes time-dependent collagen deposition, ERK1/2 phosphorylation, HSP90 upregulation and consequent airway dysfunction. More importantly, post-treatment (beginning 24 hours after HCl administration) with the HSP90 inhibitor, AUY-922 effectively blocks the development of both pulmonary fibrosis and chronic lung dysfunction. In this R21 application, we propose to expand on our initial findings through the following two specific aims: Specific Aim 1: Will establish the mouse model of HCl-induced chronic lung injury and pulmonary fibrosis, with specific quantifiable and reproducible biomarkers, demonstrate dose-response relationships and identify key pathologic signaling pathways. Specific Aim 2: Will investigate the effectiveness of the HSP90 inhibitor, AUY-922, in blocking HCl-induced pulmonary fibrosis, lung dysfunction and the upregulation of key pro-fibrotic pathways, in mice. Results from these studies will provide proof of concept for the further development of HSP90 inhibitors as antidotes against HCl-induced lung fibrosis and chronic lung dysfunction."
"9233674","PROJECT SUMMARY Individuals with BRCA1/2 mutation carriers have substantially elevated risk for breast and ovarian cancer, and they can benefit greatly from increased screening and preventive surgeries. Therefore appropriate identification of high risk individuals is an important public health priority and a quintessential example of precision medicine approaches. Widespread efforts have been made by professional organizations and health care systems to encourage providers to screen family histories and offer appropriate referrals for genetic testing and counseling, and there have been substantial marketing efforts directed toward the general public. However, little is known about whether these efforts are increasing the appropriate use of testing among families with greatest risk for having mutation. Current studies looking at the use of genetic testing have relied on chart review, questionnaires or insurance databases which only capture small subsets of patients. This study will addressing these limitations through an unprecedented collaboration between the major healthcare systems across the state, commercial genetic testing laboratories, and the epidemiologic resource of the Utah Population Database (UPDB). Through this study, clinical genetic testing information from the University of Utah, Intermountain Healthcare, the Salt Lake City Veterans Administration, and leading community oncology provider, Utah Cancer Specialists, will be linked to the genealogy, cancer, demographic and socioeconomic information in the UPDB. An estimated 316,000 individuals have been identified in the UPDB as meeting current guidelines for evaluation for hereditary breast/ovarian cancer. By linking these individuals to genetic testing records, we will interrogate many important questions including utilization of genetic testing for hereditary breast/ovarian cancer across the state and across healthcare systems and identifying barriers to appropriate genetic testing in underserved populations. This study is highly generalizable as healthcare systems across the country are addressing the challenges of providing genetic services. Utah's rural and Hispanic populations provide an opportunity to evaluate the use of genetic testing in communities that have not been widely studied. Access to data across healthcare systems is crucial for ensuring meeting national goals for more tailored and efficient healthcare."
"9464412","Abstract. Immunotherapy is one of the most promising approaches for treatment of various human diseases including cancers, autoimmune and infectious diseases. However, systemic immunotherapies have been ineffective for central nervous system (CNS) disorders because the blood-brain barrier (BBB) limits their delivery to the brain. Development of new antibody agents able to overcome the BBB is a new frontier of immunotherapy. One strategy is to use receptor-mediated transport to deliver biologics across the BBB. Abzyme proposes to use its proprietary SDALib platform for rapid generation of antibodies to receptors present in the CNS, and its Abz2 technology for reformatting traditional antibodies to create bispecific antibodies that can overcome the BBB via receptor-mediated transcytosis and binding its specific target in the brain. Using Abzyme's SDALib platform, camelid single domain antibodies against human transferrin receptor (TfR) have already been developed and generation of VHH antibodies to leptin receptor (LepR) is in progress. In addition, a set of 15 murine monoclonal antibodies against human protein targets of diagnostic and therapeutic significance is in our possession. The focus of Phase I is to demonstrate the feasibility of rapidly transforming disease-specific traditional antibodies into IgG-like bispecific antibodies, preserving antibody Fc effector functions and antibody binding affinity, and the ability of the newly obtained bispecifics to cross the BBB. Specifically, bispecific recombinant antibodies with one arm targeting HER2 or EGFR and another arm against TfR or LepR will be developed. Demonstration of the robustness of bispecific antibody production and BBB penetration in cell-based BBB models and small animals will be the basis for Phase II application submission. Phase II work focus includes: (i) obtaining the preclinical in vivo therapeutic efficacy, pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics and toxicity data for antibodies developed in Phase I that are necessary for submission of an IND; (ii) using the SDALib antibody generation platform and Abz2 bispecific approach to produce of a suite of BBB- penetrating antibodies relevant to CNS disorders. 2"
"9364715","ABSTRACT. Over 25 million people worldwide suffer from corneal blindness in one or both eyes. Corneal transplantation is the only option available to restore vision. However, there is a worldwide donor shortage, and fewer than 1% of patients with corneal blindness receive a transplant each year. Despite the great promise of corneal tissue engineering research to fill this gap, efforts to develop a clinically viable corneal substitute are hindered primarily due to the inability of the existing in vitro culture systems to reproduce the intricate extracellular matrix structure (ECM) of the stroma. Approximately 95% of the stroma is composed of type I collagen-based ECM in which regularly packed collagen fibrils have a uniform diameter and are arranged as orthogonal lamellae, providing the cornea with its unique mechanical and optical properties. The predominantly acellular nature of the stroma has motivated us to pursue a cell-free approach to the engineering of the stroma. We have recently demonstrated that the planar confinement of crowded collagen molecules induces self-organization of the collagen into highly ordered structures. Our objective here is to engineer an acellular stromal analog. Our central hypothesis is that a fully functional corneal stroma can be developed by harnessing the inherent physicochemical properties of collagen molecules. Our efforts to pursue the goals of this proposal will be pursued in three specific aims: In Aim 1, the effects of confining and crowding conditions on the long and short-range organization of collagen fibrils will be determined. Next, the impact of lumican and decorin proteoglycans on collagen ultrastructure (i.e. diameter and spacing) will be elucidated. In Aim 2, we will use a combination of theoretical and numerical modeling to provide an understanding of how crowding and confining conditions, as well as interactions with proteoglycans, impact collagen organization, morphology, and self-assembly. The predictive nature of the model would also enable identifying additional experimental parameters to further optimize the stromal-mimetic collagenous structures. In Aim 3, the long-term in vivo function of the acellular stromal analogs will be delineated by transplanting them into rabbits with deep corneal scars. In addition, in a set of exploratory studies we will investigate whether the native-like physical characteristics of the constructs (e.g., fibrillary organization, diameter and mechanical properties), would improve the differentiation of corneal stromal stem cells into native corneal stromal keratocytes. If successful, the work described here is expected to result in the development of first generation acellular corneal stromal analogs which can restore corneal function upon transplantation. The acellular stroma could be used directly for lamellar transplant in vivo or they could be integrated with the epithelial and endothelial layers to produce a fully functional cornea. Furthermore, the versatile collagen organizing technique that we propose to develop could be used for the production of biomimetic substrates to be integrated into the existing in vitro platforms to mechanistically investigate how various properties of ECM (e.g., organization and diameter) impacts cellular fate and function."
"9448073","Project Summary The ability of cells to respond to their microenvironment is mediated by multiprotein signaling complexes. A particularly important type of multiprotein signaling complex involves cell surface receptors that transmit signals upon binding protein ligands on other cells. A premier example of such a receptor is the T cell receptor (TCR)? CD3 complex, a cardinal receptor of the immune system that is essential for protective responses to microbes and cancers. The TCR?CD3 complex is composed of a diverse TCR?? heterodimer noncovalently associated with the invariant CD3 dimers CD3??, CD3??, and CD3??. The TCR mediates peptide?MHC (pMHC) recognition, while CD3 transduces activation signals to the T cell. However, the mechanism whereby TCR engagement by pMHC initiates signaling remains a mystery. Our goal is to understand the early events of TCR signaling by obtaining information on: 1) the architecture of the TCR?CD3 complex; and 2) possible allosteric changes in TCR dynamics upon binding pMHC that are relayed to CD3. These studies will be undertaken through a highly integrated project that combines multiple approaches, technologies, and investigators. We will study both an MHC class I-restricted TCR (A6) and an MHC class II-restricted TCR (MS2-3C8). A6 recognizes a viral peptide from HTLV-1 bound to HLA-A2; MS2-3C8 recognizes a self-peptide from myelin basic protein bound to HLA-DR4. Our Aims are: 1. Epitope mapping and NMR-based docking of the wild-type TCR? CD3 complex. Although the extracellular regions of CD3 interact with those of TCR, crystallization of TCR? CD3 complexes has been thwarted by the low affinity of TCR?CD3 interactions. We will employ NMR chemical shift perturbation and PRE to determine binding epitopes between CD3 and TCR. These data will be used to determine a structure for the wild-type TCR?CD3 complex. 2. Structural analysis of affinity-matured TCR? CD3 complexes by X-ray crystallography. We will attempt to overcome the weak association between TCR and CD3 ectodomains by in vitro directed evolution using yeast display to stabilize TCR?CD3 complexes for crystallization. Information on binding epitopes from NMR will be used to design TCR mutant libraries by focusing mutagenesis on regions that contact CD3. 3. Biological validation of the TCR?CD3 structure. We will validate TCR?CD3 interfaces identified by NMR or crystallography by evaluating the effects of structure- guided mutations in TCR?CD3 interfaces on complex assembly, signaling, and T cell development using cellular assays and retrogenic mice expressing mutated TCR and CD3 components. 4. Dynamics analysis of free and pMHC-bound states of TCR?? ectodomains. We will address the allosteric change hypothesis by carrying out solution NMR analysis of TCR ectodomains in free form and bound to pMHC, for both TCRs A6 and MS2-3C8. We will address the role of the lipid bilayer on TCR dynamics through MD simulations. Our combined NMR and MD results will generate a biophysical model of signaling through the TCR?CD3 complex whose basic features should apply to signaling through other multiprotein complexes and receptors."
"9424902","Project Summary More than 90% of the drugs being developed fail because of lack of efficacy or unexpected toxicity in clinical trials. This failure rate in the late stages of clinical development is in large part due to the use of overly simplistic in vitro cell assays, and in vivo animal models with limited predictive value during the various stages of drug discovery. Three-dimensional (3D) tissue models are expected to provide novel physiological and pharmacological data that will be more predictive of drug efficacy and toxicity in the clinic, and will therefore have a significant immediate and long-lasting impact in shortening of the timelines, reducing the costs, increasing the return on investment of drug discovery, and bringing new medicines to more patients more efficiently. Although high content fluorescence imaging, both confocal and non-confocal, is heavily used for this purpose in high throughput screening (HTS) laboratories, low penetration of fluorescent reagents and light scattering from 3D tumor spheroid models of a size of >50 ?m diameter hugely limits the measurements of the morphology and physiology inside the spheroids, and requires significant manipulation of the samples, including fixation, clearing and staining, which limits its practical use for HTS of large collections of compounds. Recently, we have demonstrated that optical coherence tomography (OCT) can image and obtain morphological and physiological information of an entire 3D tumor spheroid over 1 mm in size without presumptions about its shape. Furthermore, we developed a parallel OCT imaging technology and achieved over 10-fold speed improvement compared to state-of-the-art commercial OCT technologies. In this program, in collaboration with Dr. Marc Ferrer?s group at the NIH National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences, we plan to: 1) Develop and optimize a label-free, non-invasive high throughput OCT (HT-OCT) imaging platform capable of performing parallel imaging (16 channels) on a 384-well plate. We expect that the entire plate can be scanned within less than 5 minutes, including time needed for stage translation and data storage; 2) Perform live, longitudinal studies to characterize the morphology and physiology of single- and multi-cell type tumor spheroids (SCTS and MCTS) using the HT- OCT system; and 3) Evaluate the effects of oncology drugs, which encompass a broad range of mechanisms from targeted therapies modulating cellular signaling pathways to standard of care chemotherapeutics, on 3D tumor spheroids. The 3D and longitudinal information about development of various tumor spheroid models will be the first of its kind. Successful completion of these development and validation studies will establish a label- free, non-invasive HT-OCT imaging platform that can be used to accurately and quantitatively analyze 3D morphological and physiological information of various types of tumor spheroids. The techniques developed in this proposal will also be applicable to any other 3D native and/or biofabricated tissue models, such as neural spheroids, being developed for regenerative medicine and drug discovery studies."
"9447713","PROJECT SUMMARY Patients with Parkinson?s disease (PD) experience progressive motor impairments that lead to severe disability. The motor impairments of PD are associated with abnormal neuronal activity in the basal ganglia, a group of brain structures involved in movement planning and execution. The long-term goal of our research is to elucidate how the abnormal activity of the basal ganglia relates to the motor deficits in PD, with the goal of developing novel therapies to treat parkinsonism with improved specificity and fewer unwanted side effects. The proposed studies are focused on the external segment of the globus pallidus (GPe), a key structure in the basal ganglia circuitry. Traditionally, the GPe was thought to be composed of a single neuron type; it is now established that this nucleus contains different types of neurons that can be classified based on their projection targets (?upstream? to the striatum, or ?downstream? to the subthalamic nucleus or internal pallidum). In rodent models of PD, there is evidence that PD-related abnormalities occur selectively in specific types of GPe neurons, raising the possibility that different GPe neuron populations might make distinct contributions to the normal and pathological roles of the GPe. However, the translational relevance of these findings is limited by functional and anatomical differences between the rodent and primate GPe. Our experiments will define functional differences between classes of GPe neurons in normal rhesus monkeys and in monkeys rendered parkinsonian by treatment with the neurotoxin 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP). Monkeys are an excellent animal model for studying PD-related changes in brain activity, because their basal ganglia and connected brain structures closely resemble those in humans, and because MPTP-treated monkeys show the majority of the motor impairments seen in PD patients. We will use electrophysiological in vivo recordings to evaluate differences in the firing rates and patterns of GPe-upstream and GPe-downstream neurons. The projections of individual GPe neurons will be identified by their antidromic responses to electrical stimulation of the target structures (aim 1). To determine how GPe neurons modulate the activity in the striatum, subthalamic nucleus or internal pallidum, we will selectively silence GPe axonal terminals in each of these nuclei, using optogenetic methods. We will also determine whether selective silencing of GPe terminals alters PD-motor impairments in monkeys (aim 2). Finally, we will use histologic techniques to identify proteins whose expression reveals specific GPe neuron projection patterns (aim 3). Our studies will begin to determine how the activities of primate GPe neuron subtypes differ, how they regulate the activity in other basal ganglia neurons in the normal and parkinsonian states, and whether they are involved in the pathophysiology of parkinsonism. The knowledge gained from these studies is significant, as it may enable us to develop new treatments for PD that harness functional and anatomical differences of GPe neuron types."
"9315703","Title: MAT Expansion in Rural Oklahoma PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The State of Oklahoma is among the States hardest hit by a combination of uncontrolled national trends in nonmedical uses of opioid prescription drugs, past-year heroin use, and opioid-related mortality. A highly rural state, Oklahoma is challenged to identify and reach persons with unmet treatment needs despite ongoing State efforts to improve access to community-based substance abuse treatment services, promote awareness of the opioid epidemic, foster safe prescribing of opioid prescription drugs, and prevent diversion. In response to the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality?s (AHRQ) funding opportunity to expand access to medication- assisted treatment (MAT) in rural primary care, this project will develop, implement, and test an intervention to support primary care providers in three regions of rural Oklahoma in their adoption of MAT as an evidence- based strategy for treating persons with opioid use disorder. Objectives of the study include:  ? Improving access to appropriate care for persons with or at risk of opioid use disorder (OUD) in heavily  rural sections of the state that face particular challenges with opioid-related morality and/ or unmet  treatment need;  ? Preparing primary care providers to identify and care for persons with OUD using evidence-based and  comprehensive treatment that provides a combination of pharmacologic and psychosocial therapies;  ? Understanding and addressing potential barriers to the uptake of MAT in office-based settings; and  ? Disseminating effective and replicable strategies for overcoming barriers to MAT adoption to help other  rural communities improve access to and quality of care for persons with OUD. To accomplish these objectives, participating providers will be supported in their initiation and use of MAT through comprehensive training, case-based learning opportunities, practice facilitation, and individualized consultation on special topics. The implementation will be evaluated using a mixed-methods pre-/post- implementation design to assess changes in process of care and access to care for persons with OUD, as well as changes in provider attitudes and beliefs to assess the effectiveness of the implementation supports in overcoming known barriers to achieving the full promise of MAT in office-based settings."
"9348026","The metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a cluster of factors that increases the risks for cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and mortality, and currently affects > 40% of US adults. MetS is associated with endothelial dysfunction, decreased circulating endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs), and a pro-inflammatory state. We have made the exciting discovery that therapy with allogeneic mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) restores endothelial dysfunction and circulating EPCs towards normal the levels, and reduces markers of inflammation. Endothelial function represents a key driver of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in MetS, and as such, restoring endothelial function could lead to clinical benefits in this patient population. We will conduct a clinical trial using Longeveron-produced allogeneic mesenchymal stem cells (LMSCs) delivered to subjects with MetS. In Phase I of this study, we will perform a dose-escalation Safety Run-In to first establish safety of LMSC therapy in subjects with MetS. After a safety review and approval from an independent data safety monitoring board (DMSB), Phase II of this Fast-Track Study will commence. This will entail a Randomized, Double-Blinded, Placebo-Controlled Phase on 40 subjects with MetS. The following specific aims will be examined.  Specific Aim #1: To test the hypothesis that LMSCs are safe to intravenously-administer to subjects with  MetS. We will examine for incidence of treatment-emergent serious adverse events (TE-SAEs); blood  chemistry, hematology, coagulation, and urinalysis; and alloimmune reaction and T and B cell subsets to  examine levels of immune activation.  Specific Aim #2: To test the hypothesis that intravenously-administered LMSCs will improve endothelial  dysfunction and increase circulating EPCs in subjects with MetS. We will examine endothelial dysfunction  using flow-mediated vasodilation (FMD), and circulating EPCs by colony assays and flow cytometry.  Specific Aim #3: To test the hypothesis that intravenously-administered LMSCs will improve systemic markers  of inflammation in subjects with MetS. We will use ELISA to examine panels of inflammatory markers.  Specific Aim #4: To test the hypothesis that intravenously-administered LMSCs will lead to clinical  improvement in subjects with MetS. We will examine for changes in glucose control (hemoglobin A1c,  fasting glucose, fasting insulin, HOMA), lipid profile (HDL, LDL, triglycerides, cholesterol), blood pressure  and cardiac function, physical performance, and subject quality of life. We anticipate that the results of this study will lead to a much needed therapeutic for subjects with MetS. Longeveron is positioned to rapidly advance this program to a pivotal phase III trial if the results prove positive, and to bring this technology to market."
"9312669","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The mission of the Center for Aging and Population Health - Prevention Research Center (CAPH-PRC) is to promote active life expectancy in older adults by conducting and translating research on the prevention of late life disability. The CAPH-PRC has implemented scalable programs among underserved older adults at high risk for multiple chronic conditions in Pittsburgh, Allegheny County, and rural Pennsylvania (PA) counties since 2001. For this renewal application community needs and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention priorities were considered. The CAPH-PRC multidisciplinary team is proposing several new initiatives and a novel implementation research project designed to reduce obesity and subsequent chronic disease in old age. This aligns well with the Department of Health and Human Services Strategic Framework on Multiple Chronic Conditions as CAPH-PRC efforts promote use of proven self-care management and other services by individuals with multiple chronic conditions. Specifically, through collaborations with state and county Departments of Aging and Health, data resources from health and aging services will be linked to enhance the surveillance of disability and chronic disease in older adults. New technologies, platforms, outreach, and partners will be used to continue to disseminate the 10 KeysTM to Healthy Aging, a long-standing CAPH-PRC community-based program. The program will be delivered to Allegheny County senior centers through webcasts and embedded in APPRISE, a PA Department of Aging program in counties with high rates of chronic disease. Training of public health professionals and community partners, leveraging the experiences of working with our Center as part of existing research and training programs will continue.  The implementation research project will focus on mitigating obesity, which is a risk factor for many chronic diseases. Obesity is increasing more in older adults than any other age group. Concerns about weight loss in older adults have been allayed by the successful impact of healthy lifestyle weight loss and activity programs on improving function without adverse effects. Recent results from the Look AHEAD Trial showed the effectiveness of an intervention for weight loss and improved physical function. This project will systematically implement and sustain an evidence-based weight management intervention, modeled after Look AHEAD, in the community setting. The Mobility and Vitality Lifestyle Program - MOVE UP will 1) adapt, develop and pilot a community-based, translational behavioral weight management program delivered by community health workers, 2) implement and evaluate the program's impact on physical functioning, using a stepped wedge crossover design in obese adult participants aged 60-75 years in underserved communities in Allegheny County, and 3) develop strategies for sustainability considering the cost of the program, organizational capacity, and program adaptation to inform future dissemination."
"9436265","Project Summary/Abstract Alzheimer's disease (AD) and delirium are common causes of cognitive impairment in older populations that can each lead to functional disability, loss of independence, and higher healthcare costs. While AD and delirium may occur independently, they frequently coexist, resulting synergistically in poorer outcomes. The relationship between AD and delirium is complex, with AD patients at greater risk to develop delirium, and patients with delirium at risk for developing accelerated cognitive decline. Whether delirium is a marker of vulnerability to AD, unmasks unrecognized AD, accelerates preclinical AD, or can itself cause permanent neuronal damage and lead to AD are all poorly understood, and addressing these issues is a high-priority area for aging research. The goals of this R21/R33 phased innovation project is to provide ?proof of concept? for the interrelationship between delirium and AD by exploring potential shared biomarkers between these two conditions. In the R21 phase, we will leverage resources from the NIA-funded Successful Aging after Elective Surgery (SAGES study, P01AG031720), a cohort of 560 persons aged ? 70 years without dementia, 24% of whom developed delirium postoperatively, and who have undergone ? 48 months of periodic detailed cognitive and functional assessments. In a matched parallel case-control study (n=110), candidate biomarkers of neuronal injury, specifically the proteins tau and neurofilament light, and microRNAs (miR), small non-coding RNAs that have been demonstrated to become dysregulated in pathological processes including AD, will be measured in biobanked plasma from SAGES. This will allow for efficient identification of candidate blood-based biomarkers that are predictive of postoperative delirium or long-term cognitive decline (LTCD). In the R33, phase, a new prospective cohort (n=125) of patients scheduled to undergo elective orthopedic surgery under spinal anesthesia will be enrolled to confirm and expand the findings from the R21 phase. As in SAGES, the patients in the R33 cohort will have a comprehensive baseline assessment of medical history, physical and cognitive functioning, and blood sampling, and will be followed prospectively for 12 months from their initial hospitalization with periodic assessments. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) will be collected during induction of spinal anesthesia at the time of surgery, and delirium will be assessed daily during hospitalization. Biomarkers from CSF and blood will be used to predict delirium incidence, severity, and cognitive decline. We expect that one or more candidate biomarkers will have utility as a delirium risk, disease, and/or outcome biomarker. Discovery of such biomarkers will contribute to understanding of the interconnection between delirium and dementia; demonstration of a lack of a connection would provide important information as well. Defining the relationship  . between neuronal injury and AD-related biomarkers and delirium would advance the pathophysiologic understanding of AD and delirium, and may ultimately aid in the identification of potential targets for effective treatment strategies for both conditions"
"9361103","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Multiple cases of MEHMO syndrome, an X-linked intellectual disability syndrome caused by mutations in EIF2S3 that encodes a core member of the cellular protein synthesis machinery, have recently been identified; however, the causal links between misregulated protein synthesis and human disease remain poorly understood. EIF2S3 encodes the ? subunit of translation initiation factor 2 (eIF2?) that, along with the eIF2 ? and ? subunits, GTP, and the initiator Met-tRNAiMet, plays a critical role in selection of the translation start site, indicating that MEHMO patients likely incur changes in the level of protein synthesis on both a global and gene specific level. The acronym MEHMO denotes the symptoms of this syndrome: Mental deficiency, Epilepsy, Hypogenitalism, Microcephaly, and Obesity. It remains unknown how changes in gene expression incurred through mutations in eIF2? result in the presentation of MEHMO syndrome. Thus, there is a critical need to determine the underlying molecular mechanism governing the phenotype and symptoms of MEHMO patients. The long-term goal of these studies is to contribute to the identification of key factors that serve to promote MEHMO syndrome, so that improved strategies can be developed for the treatment of MEHMO patients. The overall objective in this application is to determine how misregulation of protein synthesis contributes to the symptoms of MEHMO syndrome. In Aim 1 CRISPR Cas9 genome editing will be used to generate isogenic control iPSCs expressing wild-type eIF2? from iPSCs that were derived from a MEHMO patient and express mutant eIF2?. Generation of isogeneic control iPSCs from patient iPSCs will enable investigations in the patient's genetic background to determine how mutation of eIF2? differentially modulates gene expression. In Aim 2 ribosome profiling, an informatics-based, genome-wide approach, and additional validation techniques will be used to identify mRNAs subject to changes in start codon selection and translational efficiency that may contribute to the symptoms of MEHMO syndrome. In Aim 3 wild-type and eIF2? mutant iPSCs will be differentiated into neuronal cells that will be utilized in multidisciplinary analyses, including ribosome profiling and electrophysiological readings, geared toward understanding the changes in neuronal cell homeostasis and function incurred through eIF2? mutation. These studies will provide a richer understanding of how protein synthesis is modulated upon mutation of eIF2? and the role that translational control of gene expression plays in the manifestation of MEHMO syndrome."
"9349690","Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infects ~185 million people worldwide; more than 4 million Americans. HCV infection is the most common cause of liver disease (cirrhosis), is the leading indicator for liver transplantation (LT), and is a potent driver of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). There are no effective therapies for HCC and 5- year survival is <12%, emphasizing the dire need for novel preventative strategies. New direct-acting antivirals have generated enormous optimism about controlling HCV infection, but risk for HCC remains elevated even after cure. While there have been significant improvements over the last 30 years, long-term survival of LT recipients is limited by the near universal recurrence of HCV and accelerated progression to cirrhosis due to a lack of non-invasive markers of disease progression. There is no definitive evidence that HCV directly mediates genetic damage, however there is growing evidence for early and progressive epigenetic changes, particularly in DNA methylation (5mC) and hydroxymethylation (5hmC), during liver disease. Global losses and gene-specific increases in DNA epigenetic marks are common during inflammation, cirrhosis, and HCC. Cirrhosis is a well-defined precancerous condition, yet its molecular underpinnings at the level of the epigenome have not been examined. Preliminary and published DNA epigenetic mark profiling in cirrhotic liver and HCC by our group revealed that hundreds of genes displayed abnormal 5mC and 5hmC patterns between normal and diseased states, with 5hmC particularly affected during cirrhosis. Based on these preliminary data, we propose three specific aims to test the hypothesis that altered DNA epigenetic marks caused by HCV infection drive liver disease and hepatocarcinogenesis. Identification of these defects and their mechanistic underpinnings is expected to yield new therapeutic targets and clinical markers. We further propose that the elevated HCC risk after cure is due, in part, to epigenetic `scars' left by HCV infection, which also represent a clinically targetable entity. In aim 1 we will define how HCV infection impacts DNA marks and transcription globally in primary liver cirrhosis and relate these to patient clinical data to define HCV infection-specific defects. In aim 2, we will investigate the earliest stages of HCV infection in serial liver biopsies from LT patients to define the evolution of DNA epigenetic mark changes and, by integrating findings with aims 1 and 3, define HCV-specific epigenetic signatures that serve as useful markers of liver injury. Finally, in aim 3 we will use a novel immortalized hepatocyte cell culture model to define mechanistically how HCV modulates the epigenome to drive transformation. Results from these studies are expected to greatly enhance our understanding of how a widespread infectious agent, coupled with ubiquitous chronic inflammation, influence DNA epigenetic marks in a way that drives transformation. Our studies should also yield completely new information on both the acute and chronic phases of HCV infection, providing new targets for therapy, diagnosis, and prognosis."
"9446065","Abstract Activating mutations of the KRAS gene are found in ~90% of pancreatic (PDAC) and ~50% of colorectal (CRC) cancers. However, therapeutic strategies designed to counter or extinguish KRAS signaling remain unsuccessful. Redundant signaling pathways and a complex solid tumor microenvironment are key barriers to current KRAS targeting efforts. Most conventional drug testing targeting KRAS has commonly used conventional cell line systems that lack clinical relevance and biological heterogeneity and thereby failed in patients. More recently, patient-derived models, including primary cell cultures, organoids or spheroids have been deployed in large screens designed to identify effective combination regimens. Since patient-derived models more clinically representative, lead single agents or combinations are exhibiting a higher likelihood of translational success. Our approach long-term goal is to establish and test agents using patient-derived xenografts (PDX) coupled with an ex-vivo tumor tissue culture assay that more effectively tests drug sensitivity. Using this ex-vivo method we tested 36 drug combinations against a panel of 10 PDAC PDX tumors to identify drug combinations that demonstrate synergistic effects. These combinations include, MEK inhibitors along with multi-kinase inhibitor, suntinib, or CDK4/6 inhibitors. Synergistic anticancer activity using MEK-CDK4/6 combinations also occurs in our CRC PDX models that have translated to an ongoing clinical trial. Our preliminary studies and ongoing clinical trial provide a strong rationale to further test these combinations in large cohorts of PDXs. In the proposed study, we aim to: 1) determine the effectiveness of the MEK inhibitor-based combinations through in vivo PDX trials; 2) establish and characterize PDXs from patients enrolled in a clinical trial that combines MEK and CDK4/6 inhibitors; and 3) identify biomarkers of responding tumors and explore the mechanisms of resistance. The identification of lead combinations in studies using clinically relevant patient-derived model systems predicts a higher chance of success in future clinical studies. In addition, all proposed test agents are approved for use against cancer or are being evaluated in the clinical trials. Thus, there is a high probability that these efforts will be quickly translated to the clinic and rapidly benefit PDAC and CRC patients."
"9459190","Project Summary Understanding the circuit mechanisms that give rise to perception and behavior requires linking neuronal activity to connectivity. This can be accomplished at multiple scales and ideally can be related to further studies using activity manipulations to demonstrate causality. Recent work in the mouse visual system has revealed the contributions of specific cell types to the generation of visual receptive field properties as well as state-dependent changes in the representation of visual information. But it is unknown whether the cortical circuit mechanisms and principles revealed in the mouse are preserved across species.  This project aims to develop and refine molecular, genetic, viral and large scale optical and electrical recording tools for use in the non-rodent cortex. Paradigms will be established by which these tools can link visual function to cortical modules, cell types, and connectivity. Experiments that expand knowledge of the role of specific cortical cell types to be comparable to data collected in mice are required to evaluate what are common circuit mechanisms and principles of cell type specific computations versus circuits that are specialized to particular species or functions. Systematically controlling visual stimuli while conducting recordings of activity with these tools will create data sets that make it possible to test whether principles and functions of specific circuit motifs emerging from studies in the mouse cortex can be generalized to higher species.  Specific aims are organized around levels of selectivity at which visually-evoked activity will be linked to circuits: 1) modules, 2) cell types, and 3) connectivity. These aims share two different basic approaches for recording dynamic activity from large neuronal populations ? two-photon calcium imaging and high-density (128 and 384 channel) laminar silicone electrode arrays. Aim 1 will link visually evoked neuronal activity to modular and laminar organization of primary visual cortex (V1). This knowledge can be combined with known relationships between connectivity and modular/laminar organization to link circuits to function. Aim 2 will link visually evoked neuronal activity to V1 cell types by: combining 2-photon calcium imaging with post mortem identification and antibody staining; and recording activity of single neurons with high-density laminar electrode arrays and then identifying cell types based on electrical images. Aim 3 will directly link visually evoked neuronal activity to connectivity using cross-correlation analysis of recordings from up to 150 neurons recorded simultaneously with high-density laminar electrode arrays."
"9278047","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Project 8 ? Medical Technologies: Aligning Private Rewards with Health Impacts Over the past several decades, new medical technologies have generated dramatic improvements in health outcomes for many groups of patients. While a key ingredient in the development of any new medical technology is a scientific breakthrough, market incentives are often a critical determinant of which scientifically feasible medical technologies successfully make the transition from a scientist's lab to a patient's bedside. Hence, the design of public policies that affect market incentives ?such as the patent system and regulations such as those of the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) direction of medical innovation. ?can have important effects on the rate and The goal of this project is to investigate whether our current system of patent and FDA policies fails to provide incentives for the development of some scientifically feasible medical technologies that would generate health benefits to patients. Our focus is the so-called ?new uses? distortion, which may arise in cases where an off- patent drug has a new use discovered, such as the discovery that an off-patent diabetes drug may be an effective cancer treatment. There are few incentives for private research investments into such new uses of old drugs, and public research subsidies are not explicitly designed to encourage research into such new uses. We will develop a conceptual framework for policy analysis (Aim 1) and will develop newly-constructed data (Aim 2) to empirically test (Aim 3) whether this ?new uses? distortion results in some scientifically feasible drugs never reaching patients. We will then attempt to quantify the health value to patients of these ?missing? medical technologies (Aim 4), in order to estimate the potential health gains that could be realized under alternative policies. The results of this project aim to contribute more broadly to the ongoing debate about how best to deliver evidence-based medicine to patients, particularly in the emerging field of personalized medicine. Specifically, to the extent that the ?new uses? problem exists, the magnitude of the invisible costs of the ?missing? innovations it may cause are growing as personalized medicine becomes increasingly important. Personalized medicine is based on the idea of separating patients into subgroups, under the assumption that drugs that work for one subgroup of patients may not work well for another. As progress is made in science and medicine about how best to classify patients into such subgroups, opportunities will arise for new medically valuable matches between drugs and more targeted groups?and many or most of these new matches would likely come from the stock of existing drugs. Maximizing the health of an aging population will thus increasingly depend on policies that promote the most effective use of medications across patients and conditions."

"9532416","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Apolipoprotein E is a major regulator of intracerebral lipid metabolism and has been implicated as an important actor shaping synaptic biology. In addition, more than two decades ago, the APOE4 allele was identified as the strongest genetic risk factor for the sporadic form of Alzheimer's disease (AD). This K99/00 application proposes to examine the complex impact of APOE in a neurodegenerative context, trying to disambiguate its role as a necessary catalyst of Aß neurotoxic effects in AD, while acting as a cholesterol and phospholipids carrier to the synapse and as a regulator of NMDAR-dependent calcium influx in a physiological context. Taking advantage of recently developed cutting-edge techniques such as awake in vivo multiphoton calcium imaging, array tomography, and synaptoneurosome purification with lipidomics assays to examine synaptic lipid content, I will interrogate the functional relevance of APOE towards Aß mediated neurotoxicity at the synapse. During the mentored phase of this award, I will address how APOE gene disruption is protective against Aß toxicity. Our preliminary data suggest that APOE null diminishes oligomeric Aß's effects on calcium dyshomeostasis, both in the setting of transgenic mice undergoing awake in vivo calcium imaging and in wild type mice exposed to biologically produce oligomeric Aß. To directly test the hypothesis that the beneficial effects of APOE null are due to disruption of APOE-Aß interactions, we will dissociate the APOE/Aß complexes in AD transgenic mice by intraperitoneal injection of a specific competitive inhibitor, Aß12-28P. Using a novel gene transfer approach by intravenous injection of AAV9, the independent phase will then restore the expression of the different APOE isoforms and evaluate how each variant modulate neuronal activity and synaptic integrity. We have already succeeded in transducing astrocytes brain wide after a single peripheral infusion of AAV9. We will then express APOE2, APOE3 and APOE4 in the brains of APOE-null or APP/APOE-null animals. We postulate that each variant will differentially shape APOE physiological functions and Aß neurotoxicity. In particular, we expect that APOE2 will act as a neuroprotective factor on the neural system and limit Aß synaptotoxicity, while APOE4 will be detrimental at the synapse. These experiments will lay the groundwork for my independent career. By learning structural and functional synaptic assays with Dr. Hyman (my mentor), combined with newly acquired biochemical -omics approaches with Dr. Gerszten (an expert in lipidomics and proteomics analyses) and modern gene transfer approaches with Dr. Breakefield, I will be in an excellent position to take advantage of emerging discoveries in neurodegenerative diseases and to launch an independent career to both carry out careful structural, functional, and biochemical phenotyping and to create and manipulate genetic models of neurological diseases."
"9344287","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Stage IV neuroblastoma (NB) in children >18 months of age is an aggressive disease that often recurs after successful induction therapy. Despite intensive treatment regimens, survival rates are unacceptable. Ganglioside GD2 expressed on NB is an ideal target for antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity. Anti-GD2 monoclonal antibody (mAb) immunotherapy in stage IV patients with minimal residual disease significantly prolongs progression free survival (PFS) and increased overall survival (OS); however, 37% of these stage IV patients relapse within 2 years. Unfortunately, clinical efficacy of anti-GD2 mAbs has been limited by toxicities. There is a need for novel and innovative approaches that increase anti-tumor activity without increasing toxicities. We recently showed that anti-CD3 activated T cells (ATC) armed with murine GD2Bi (anti-CD3 x anti-GD2 bispecific antibody) and ATC armed with anti-CD3 x anti-GD2 (humanized version of 3F8) exhibit enhanced in vitro and in vivo potency against NB cells. Delayed tumor growth and improved survival was seen in a NB xenograft model following infusions of hu3F8Bi armed ATC. In a phase I clinical trial for metastatic breast, multiple infusions of anti-CD3 x anti-Her2 bispecific antibody (Her2Bi) armed ATC in combination with low dose IL-2 and granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) in women with heavily pretreated stage IV metastatic 0-3+ Her2 positive breast cancer were safe, induced anti-breast cancer cytotoxicity, anti-breast cancer antibodies, serum Th1 cytokine patterns, and IL-12 levels. Surprisingly, median OS was 36 months with 1 very good partial response in a patient with liver metastases and 12 patients with stable disease out of 22 evaluable pts at 15 weeks after starting immunotherapy. We hypothesized that hu3F8Bi armed ATC will enhance anti-NB cytotoxicity and vaccinate the pts against their own NB antigens. To test this hypothesis, we propose the following specific aims: 1) Submit a IND, produce GD2Bi (hu3F8Bi), and perform a phase I dose-escalation protocol in patients with recurrent/refractory NB and GD2+ tumors to determine the MTD for hu3F8Bi armed ATC infused twice a week for 8 infusions in combination with daily low dose IL-2 (300,000 IU/m2/day) in a standard 3 + 3 dose escalation schema with 40, 80, and 160 x 106 cells/kg/infusion dose levels; 2) Conduct a phase II clinical trial in 22 patients to explore efficacy and confirm the toxicity profile of hu3F8Bi armed ATC using the MTD; 3) Sequentially monitor immune responses directed at NB (cytotoxicity, IFN? EliSpots), phenotyping, cytokine patterns, and antibodies to NB; 4) Assess survival and persistence of armed ATC in the blood and tumor biopsies to confirm trafficking of armed ATC to tumor; and 5) Conduct an exploratory study of [18F] FDG PET/CT in 10 selected patients with PET/CT measurable soft tissue and skeletal lesions to evaluate trafficking of armed ATC. If successful, these studies will provide a shift in the treatment paradigm for NB where cytotoxicity would not only reduce minimal residual disease but also vaccinate the patients against their own tumor resulting in significant improvement in PFS and OS."
"9298142","Project Summary This is a high impact proposal with the overall goal to improve outcomes in aplastic anemia (AA). The disease consumes extensive resources and confers significant morbidity and mortality, due to their progressive nature and complications of suboptimal therapy. Without definitive treatment, mortality from severe AA approaches 70% at two years. Unfortunately, patients with acquired AA may have a response to immunosuppressive therapy (IST), but clonal evolution to myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) or PNH develops in up to 40% of the patients, usually many months to years after the diagnosis of AA. This persistent clonal hematopoiesis is a challenge and requires further study in the patient population. The focus of this application is to identify the presence of somatic mutations in AA at varied times points in the disease. The literature suggests that clonal hematopoiesis is prevalent at diagnosis in AA but its correlation with disease phenotype and outcome is limited. This proposal, stemming from work done on Dr. DeZern?s K23, will greatly inform that knowledge in a select group of AA with known clinical responses."
"9566394","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Diabetic retinopathy is a complication of diabetes that induces visual impairment, and is a leading cause of blindness. According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 45% of patients diagnosed with diabetes develop diabetic retinopathy. Altered retinal blood flow is an early consequence of the disease, and may contribute to vascular damage that occurs as the disease progresses. Thus, understanding the pathogenesis of vascular dysfunction is essential to preventing later stages of diabetic retinopathy. From its onset, diabetic retinopathy is characterized by an inability of the retinal blood supply to match neuronal demand for uninterrupted delivery of oxygen and nutrients. In the retina, most of these interactions take place at the level of capillaries, where pericytes, the only contractile cells at this level, adjust capillary diameter in response to neuronal signals. Th neurotransmitter acetylcholine, released by cholinergic neurons, induces pericyte-mediated vasodilation. Both pericytes and cholinergic neurons are structurally compromised in diabetic retinopathy. It is unclear, however, whether this translates into impaired vasomotor function. To address this, in Aim 1 we will test the hypothesis that decline in vasomotor ability of pericytes and changes in their gap junction coupling mediate impaired vasomotor control in diabetic retina. We will (1a) measure pericyte activity in response to electrical and chemical stimulation, then (1b) determine whether decreased gap junction coupling reduces pericyte activity propagation. This is relevant, since individual pericytes control local capillary diameter, while signaling between pericytes via gap junctions allows for the spatial distribution of vasomotor control. In Aim 2, we will test the hypothesis that reduced vascular sensitivity to cholinergic signaling and a decline in cholinergic amacrine cell function both impair vasomotor activity. First we will (2a) use cholinergic agonists and antagonists to determine whether the efficacy of cholinergic regulation of capillary diameter is compromised in diabetic retina. Then, (2b) we will use an optogenetic approach to directly activate cholinergic amacrine cells, to determine whether they are functionally compromised. Altered retinal blood flow is a common characteristic of patients with early stages of diabetic retinopathy, and likely contributes to latr complications of the disease. Functional compromises to the cells responsible for regulating blood flow in the retina may account for this vasomotor deficit. Understanding the mechanisms of vasomotor dysfunction could reveal novel therapeutic targets, and provide additional approaches for treating diabetic retinopathy."
"9330039","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Everyday events, such as preparing a meal or working out at the local gym, make up the contents of our daily lives. Prior work has shown that perceiving these events in a normative fashion facilitates memory for the event (Sargent, et al., 2013). However, as a group, older adults and individuals with early-stage Alzheimer's Disease (AD) perceive events less normatively than their younger counterparts (Zacks, et al., 2006). Moreover, normative event perception has been associated with the efficient execution of everyday actions (Bailey, et al., 2013). The ability to remember everyday events and carry out everyday activities safely and efficiently are both important skills that serve to facilitate independent living in older adults. However, many interventions do not demonstrate such far-reaching effects (i.e. Richmond, et al., 2011).  While many cognitive faculties, including event perception, are perturbed by old age, older adults and individuals with early-stage AD are known to have relatively intact implicit learning and implicit memory systems (Knopman & Nissen, 1987; Negash, et al., 2007; Rieckmann & Backman, 2009). The current proposal hypothesizes that by capitalizing on intact implicit cognitive systems by using implicit cueing methods older adults and individuals with early-stage AD might benefit in terms of both normalization in perception of events and improvements in memory for the event itself.  Despite the obvious importance of these abilities, little is known about training methods that could serve boost event perception and event memory. In addition, implicit learning methods have not yet been embedded in rich, naturalistic materials such as those depicting everyday events. To this end, Studies 1-6 will test a variety of different implicit cues for the potential to encourage normative perception (i.e. implicit learning) of an event (Aim #1). Study 7 will investigate the extent to which implicit learning might generalize to untrained contexts and the visual behaviors associated with normative event perception and the sensitivity of the experimental measures to biomarkers associated with AD (Aims #1 & 3). Finally, Study 8 will test whether encouraging normative event perception with the use of implicit cues has an effect on subsequent memory for the event and whether event memory is sensitive to AD biomarkers (Aims #2 & 3). In addition, the extent to which visual behaviors present at important timepoints during the event is related to later event memory will be explored. I predict that (a) implicit cueing will encourage normative event perception, (b) that implicitly learned properties of normative event perception will transfer to uncued materials and (c) implicit learned properties governing normative event perception will have a positive impact on event memory."
"9567636","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Genetic aberrations in lymphoid malignancies, including acute lymphoblastic leukemias (ALLs), often include chromosomal rearrangements that result in the dramatic upregulation or dysregulation of transcription factors and other chromatin-associating proteins. This results in altered chromatin states and transcriptional outputs that lead to increased cellular proliferation and other malignant phenotypes. While the activity of transcription factors is very difficult to inhibit directly with small molecule drugs, chromatin-associating transcription co- factors that bind to histones have recently been shown to be amenable to small molecule inhibition. We have discovered and developed chemical probes for a class of protein modules called bromodomains, which are principally involved in the recognition of acetylated lysines on histones. Using these chemical probes, we have established a rationale for targeting this class of proteins in ALL. Treatment of ALL cells with bromodomain inhibitors leads to a dramatic reduction in expression of specific ALL oncogenes, including the notoriously 'undruggable' oncogenic transcription factor MYC. Selective disruption of oncogene expression leads to a decrease in ALL cell proliferation both in vitro and in murine xenograft models. The studies proposed here aim to characterize the mechanism by which bromodomain inhibition selectively effects specific oncogene expression in ALL cells, and to use these insights to further exploit putative ALL cell dependencies on chromatin-associating factors. Ours studies show that loss of MYC expression is a direct result of inhibiting the bromodomain-containing protein BRD4 from the MYC gene locus, leading to the hypothesis that BRD4 is an ALL-dependency gene. However, as BRD4 is widely expressed in many cell types, it remains to be seen how its inhibition leads to potent anti-ALL effects. In Aim 1, we will perfor genome-wide studies of bromodomain protein displacement with chemical probes using ChIP-seq, particularly focusing on effects within promoter distal cis-regulatory control elements of the  genome, or enhancers. In Aim 2 we will study bromodomain inhibition in combination with other chromatin-targeting small molecules in ALL cells, primarily focusing on compounds that target histone acetylation including histone deacetylase and acetyltransferase probes. We will model these potential therapeutic combinations in murine models of disseminated ALL. Aim 3 of this proposal seeks to expand the chemical toolbox of chromatin-targeting small molecules, specifically focusing on the bromodomain of the ATAD2 protein, a MYC co-activator that is highly expressed in ALL. We will use high- throughput compound screening and iterative medicinal chemistry employing a suite of optimized bromodomain-binding assay systems. To achieve these aims, I have assembled an excellent and seasoned advisory team, including Dr. James Bradner [Mentor, DFCI], an expert in chemical biology and hematologic malignancies; Dr. Thomas Look [Co-mentor, DFCI] an expert in leukemogenesis and animal models of ALL; and Dr. Richard Young [Co-mentor, MIT], an expert in chromatin biology and transcriptional networks."
"9327552","The long-term goal of this application is to elucidate the mechanisms and functions of inner retina oscillation in development and maintenance of the visual system. The proposal is based on the existence of two independent oscillation mechanisms in adult retina. We hypothesize that these oscillation mechanisms are built-in function of the retina, masked by glutamate released by photoreceptor in normal situation but emergent under deafferentation conditions such as photoreceptor degeneration and complete congenital stationary night blindness to ensure stable connection between the eye and the brain. We have found that deleting connexin 36 (Cx36) but not Cx45 genes can silence retinal oscillation. We have also preliminarily tested mice with photoreceptor degeneration but without Cx36 expression and found that retinogeniculate projections become abnormal. Since retinal oscillation appears to have a biological function, it is important to know mechanistic details of the two mechanisms. Aim-1 will thus focus on delineating the cellular origin of the less understood flupirtine-insensitive mechanism. Aim-2 will stringently test the role of oscillation in maintaining retinofugal projections by genetically manipulating Cx36 gene including inducible inactivation in adult animals after photoreceptor degeneration. In order to understand whether retinal oscillation has other functions, it is necessary to know which retinal neurons oscillate and through what mechanisms. Aim-3 will thus survey synaptic inputs onto genetically identifiable RGCs in two retinal deafferentation mouse models and test the hypotheses that mouse RGCs are more diverse than currently appreciated and that group-specific circuit connection characteristics exist to drive RGCs' unique physiological light responses in different groups. A fruitful outcome will in the short-term generate a resource that contains many genetically identifiable RGC types in mouse and in the long-term assign group-specific morphometric features, intrinsic membrane properties, and light response characteristics to them. These efforts fill knowledge gaps, confer a biological function to retinal oscillation in maintaining RGC central projection, and provide a strong foundation for future inquiries into retinal disease mechanisms and treatment window and/or options."
"9289368","Inhaled silica has been compellingly linked to several human autoimmune diseases, including systemic lupus erythematosus and ANCA vasculitis that destroy kidneys, lungs, and other organs. However, little is known about the mechanism of autoimmune induction or the role of genetic susceptibility. Autoantibodies are prominent in these disorders and key mediators of tissue injury. The experiments proposed here test the overarching hypothesis that the silica-exposed lung creates a microenvironment that alters autoimmune cell regulation in genetically susceptible individuals. We further propose that this breach in B cell tolerance occurs through the intermediary of pulmonary tertiary lymphoid structures or iBALT that promote survival and activation of autoreactive lymphocytes, and that the human HLA DRB1*1501 risk allele and Toll-like receptor ligand co-exposure contribute to this breach. This hypothesis can be tested using in vivo models that permit complex and dynamic immune cell interactions at the environment/lung interface and that are amenable to mechanistic dissection. We propose three Specific Aims supported by extensive preliminary data and established cross-disciplinary collaborations. Specific Aim 1 tests the hypothesis that silica- induced iBALT is a major site for loss of B cell tolerance, and that the extent and nature of iBALT formation and defective tolerance varies according to genetic susceptibility. We will measure recruitment and activation of autoreactive B cells within iBALT and secondary lymphoid organs of silica-exposed subjects using flow cytometry, immunoassay, cell culture, and microdissection. This aim is possible using a unique and experimentally tractable murine model system developed in our lab, in which an autoantibody transgene serves as a reliable reporter to track autoreactive cells and monitor well-defined tolerance phenotypes within the context of genetically distinct B6 and autoimmune MRL, NZB, and BXSB strains that collectively mirror human lupus genetic heterogeneity. Specific Aim 2 tests the role of a potent human autoimmune risk allele, HLA class II DRB1*1501, in silica-induced iBALT induction and proteinase 3 (PR3)- ANCA vasculitis. This aim uses two novel humanized models that replace murine class II molecules with human class II DR2 (DRA1/DRB1*1501). We will measure silica exposure impact on autoreactive cell recruitment and tolerance using DR2+ B6 autoAb Tg mice, and on anti-PR3 autoreactivity and vasculitis using dual humanized Hu-HSC mice expressing DR2 both in thymus and on human immune cells and subject to PR3 immunization or PR3-ANCA infusion. Specific Aim 3 tests the capacity of silica to break tolerance to myeloperoxidase (MPO) or to modify anti-MPO immunity and MPO-ANCA vasculitis. This aim takes advantage of MPO immunoreactivity and disease-susceptibility in MRL and MPO-deficient B6 models. Ultimately, insight into mechanisms of silica-controlled autoimmunity will identify new targets and new routes for therapeutic intervention to arrest injury and prevent relapses in patients with autoimmune disease."
"9451082","ABSTRACT A major goal in clinical neuroscience is to develop efficient treatments to prevent or minimize the loss of brain function caused by pathological decreases or increases of neuronal activity, which are hallmarks of a wide variety of neurological disorders. Interestingly, in some instances, the brain has evolved mechanisms to partially correct abnormal neuronal function. Understanding the adaptive mechanisms that restore brain function would not only provide insight into the functioning of the normal brain but also guide future approaches to ameliorate loss of brain function caused by disease or injury. We propose to start a research program to investigate the cellular and circuit mechanisms by which the brain maintains constant behavioral output, even when neuronal activity is naturally variable or it is perturbed. Our preliminary evidence with songbirds indicate that the brain circuits involved in song production demonstrate a high level of behavioral resilience both at short and long timescales. At the short timescale the patterns of firing of premotor neurons directly involved in song production vary from day to day, although there is no measurable variability in the song. At the long timescale, we genetically perturbed the activity of these premotor neurons and this caused a dramatic disruption of song. However, manipulated birds fully recovered from the perturbation, and were able to produce their original song after around 10 days. We will build on these results to explore the neuronal mechanisms that ensure behavioral resilience in a brain circuit involved in a complex behavior using gene delivery, optogenetics, in vivo functional imaging, behavioral analysis, and computational modelling."
"9553150","Project summary The characteristic feature of glaucoma is a progressive loss of retinal ganglion cells. Drugs that lower the intraocular pressure are the mainstay of pharmaceutical therapy of glaucoma, but they are not effective in all cases. New therapeutic approaches would therefore be welcome.  Much evidence points to the optic nerve head as the point of initial insult to ganglion cell axons in glaucoma. In this anatomical location, a meshwork of astrocytes forms the direct cellular environment of the axons. Following an insult to the optic nerve, the astrocytes in the optic nerve head become reactive. We have studied the time course of astrocyte reactivity in the optic nerve head after nerve crush morphologically and on the level of gene expression. We also studied astrocyte morphology in the DBA/2J mouse line that develops glaucoma spontaneously. DBA/2J mice were crossed with a strain that expresses GFP in individual astrocytes, thus making the microscopic observation of reactive astrocytes easy. One of our findings was that, before any signs of ganglion cell degeneration become obvious in the retina, some astrocytes grow new, longitudinal processes into the retrolaminar axon bundles. We are now going to study the mechanisms that drive the growth of these processes and their function.  We believe that astrocyte reactivity, at least in its early phase, is a beneficial response that aims to protect ganglion cells and their axons. A possible therapeutic approach to glaucoma would be to enhance the early astrocytic response. We therefore propose to study the regulatory mechanisms in the optic nerve that govern early astrocyte reactivity. We compared the genes that are differentially regulated in our own microarray screen (using optic nerve crush) with those that were reported in recent studies from other laboratories using DBA/2J mice or the episcleral vein injection model of ocular hypertension in rats. We identified signaling molecules and transcription factors that were up-regulated early in DBA/2J mice and after nerve crush and therefore appear to be involved in regulating astrocyte reactivity both in glaucoma and after traumatic injury. Most of these genes are also up-regulated in the episcleral vein injection model. Our candidates are the signaling molecules Bone Morphogenetic Proteins 1 and 2, Leukemia Inhibitory Factor), Secreted Phosphoprotein 1 (osteopontin), Lipocalin 2, and Transforming Growth Factor beta 1; and the transcription factors Tcf19, TGF?-Induced Factor Homeobox 1, Runt- Related Transcription factors 1 and 2, and E2f8. We will study their involvement in three models of glaucoma, and after optic nerve crush. For this purpose, we will make use of methodological advances during the first grant period, namely the efficient transfection of optic nerve head astrocytes by AAV2/9, the ability to analyze dissociated astrocytes with well-preserved morphology from the optic nerve head, and a mouse strain that expresses GFP in astrocytes in the manner of a ?live Golgi stain?."
"9431322","ABSTRACT Diabetes prevalence has more than doubled in the past two decades, and now nearly 1 in 10 Americans has diabetes. After a similar steep increase, obesity rates among US adults have been stable in the past 10 years, but strong disparities persist and rates are still rising in some groups. Prevention efforts to date have mostly focused on individual-level risk factors. However, a growing body of research has linked diabetes, obesity and other cardiometabolic risk factors to a range of community characteristics, suggesting that environmental factors can have a direct beneficial or deleterious influence on disease risk. Numerous studies have observed significant and plausible associations between diabetes and obesity prevalence and attributes of the social and physical environment. Some of these community factors are amenable to intervention, yet the true magnitudes of their relative contributions, remains unclear, especially after adjusting for population characteristics. In response to FOA-DP-17-001, we aim to collaborate with other funded Centers to examine modifiable community characteristics that may together explain stark disparities in diabetes, obesity and other cardiometabolic conditions in the United States using ecologic and multi-level study designs. Specifically, we aimtousecounty-levelprevalencedatafromtheBehavioralRiskFactorSurveillanceSystem(BRFSS)and individual-levelelectronicmedicalrecorddatafromaverylargenationalVeteran?sAdministration(VA) cohort (~4.6 million patients) to examine the relationship between key community factors pertaining to the food and housing environment and 3 outcomes: diabetes, obesity and discordance between county-level diabetes and obesity prevalence, an approach that allows us to examine unique contextual risk factors for each condition. Expanding on prior work, we propose developing novel community measures that may contribute to diabetes and obesity disparities. Our primary food environment measures to be refined, shared with other Centers, and analyzed pertain to relative ?food swamp? measures (neighborhoods in which cheap, energy- dense and pre-prepared food is a dominant option). Our primary housing environment measures to be refined, shared and analyzed are ?housing cost burden? measures. We will use causal inference techniques to strengthen our multilevel analyses (e.g. instrumental variable analysis and negative control outcomes). We will also perform causal mediation analysis and primary data collection to examine potential mechanistic pathways on our main study datasets. Primary data will be collected through a planned social determinant of health survey in partnership with the New York City Health Department. Capitalizing on (1) the breadth of expertise among New York University researchers in the areas of health surveillance, food and housing policy research, and causal inquiry methods; (2) access to a very large cohort of VA patients; and (3) our demonstrated track record of leadership and collaboration in other CDC-funded networks, this study offers a powerful opportunity to identify community disease determinants for use in policy and systems change to reduce disparities."
"9395442","ABSTRACT Compulsive eating behavior, an underlying transdiagnostic construct of eating disorders and some forms of obesity, affects an estimated 15 million adults in the United States. Negative reinforcement, or performing a behavior (i.e. overeating) to alleviate a negative emotional state, is conceptualized as a key construct of compulsive eating as well as compulsive drug use. Diminished reward sensitivity is thought to contribute to the negative emotional state driving the negative reinforcing effects of palatable food, but causal neurobiological mechanisms are poorly understood. Recent evidence indicates a key role of the corticotropin releasing factor (CRF) system in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) in downregulation of dopamine systems in animal models of addiction, and this brain stress system is upregulated in the VTA by drugs of abuse. Additionally, the upregulation of the CRF-CRF1 system in the VTA is implicated in driving drug self-administration, escalation of intake, and relapse. In a model of compulsive eating, we have shown that intermittent palatable diet access results in decreased reward sensitivity, increased oral intake of d-Amphetamine, and increased CRF in the VTA. The primary objective of this application is to uncover functional reward circuitry adaptations induced by palatable diet cycling that contribute to reward deficits, compulsive eating, and susceptibility to drug taking. We hypothesize that palatable diet cycling causes reward deficits through a CRF-dependent mechanism in the VTA, where recruited CRF dampens dopaminergic release. A secondary objective is to compare male and female rats on palatable diet cycling induced reward deficits, subsequent susceptibility to drug self- administration, and modulation of these effects by the CRF system. Thus, in Aim 1, we will examine reward system functioning in male and female palatable diet cycled rats, by measuring sensitivity to the reward enhancing effects of d-Amphetamine using intra-cranial self-stimulation (ICSS) procedures. To then determine susceptibility to self-administer drugs of abuse, we will investigate intravenous (IV) d-Amphetamine self- administration, a more reliable method of drug self-administration in animals that avoids the confound of oral ingestion. In Aim 2, we will use viral-mediated CRF-1 receptor gene knockdown in the VTA of TH-Cre rats to examine the role of the CRF-CRF1 system on overconsumption of palatable food in the first hour of renewed access, d-Amphetamine-evoked dopamine release (in vivo microdialysis), reward system functioning (ICSS), and IV drug self-administration. The goal of these experiments is uncovering functional reward circuitry adaptations induced by palatable diet cycling that contribute to reward deficits and addictive-like behaviors. These proposed experiments have potential to unravel the mechanisms linking the brain reward and stress systems in compulsive eating and other addictions with implications for pharmacotherapeutic treatments."
"9557937","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Opioid receptor agonists remain the drugs of choice to treat moderate to severe pain, but their use is limited by adverse effects including tolerance, dependence, abuse, and respiratory depression. A recent increase in overdoses and deaths is fueling concerns about opioids that further limit their legitimate medical use. A growing body of evidence indicates that the therapeutic window of an opioid can be increased by combining it with another drug, such that smaller doses of the opioid (in combination with another drug) produce the desired therapeutic effect. Like opioids, cannabinoid receptor agonists have antinociceptive effects and are used to treat pain; however, their use is limited because of adverse effects, including abuse, and because they are effective under a very limited range of conditions when administered alone. Converging lines of evidence indicate that opioid/cannabinoid combinations might be very effective and safe for treating pain. For example, our studies show that in monkeys the potency of opioids to produce antinociception is increased significantly by cannabinoids at doses that do not increase the potency of opioids for producing reinforcing or discriminative stimulus effects. Those results were obtained following acute administration of drugs, although treatment of pain often requires repeated drug treatment. Despite the potential clinical utility of opioid/cannabinoid combinations, little is known about th consequences of repeated daily administration of combinations; the proposed studies extend our initial findings to repeated drug administration to more closely model treatment in pain patients. These studies test the hypothesis that the adverse effects of opioids, that limit their clinical use, are reduced or avoided by combining small doses of an opioid with a cannabinoid. Aim 1 compares the long- term effects of daily dosing with the high efficacy opioid receptor agonist fentanyl administered alone and in combination with the high efficacy cannabinoid receptor agonist CP55,940 to test the hypothesis that administration of an opioid/cannabinoid combination reduces or prevents the development of opioid tolerance and physical dependence. Aim 2 assesses the abuse potential (positive reinforcing effects) of opioid/cannabinoid combinations using a choice procedure in which monkeys choose between fentanyl alone and a combination of fentanyl and CP55,940. Aim 3 characterizes other potential adverse effects of opioid/cannabinoid combinations (sedation, impaired complex task performance, and respiratory depression) and possible pharmacokinetic interactions between fentanyl and CP55,940. These studies will characterize opioid/cannabinoid combinations that increase the therapeutic window of opioids by selectively decreasing the dose of opioid necessary for therapeutic effects, thereby reducing and possibly avoiding the occurrence of adverse effects that currently limit the legitimate medical use of opioids. Using a species and procedures that are highly translatable to humans, these studies will provide proof-of-concept for this innovative approach to pain treatment."
"9328224","Abstract Dysfunction in antigen (Ag) presentation in mucosal tissues contributes to infection, cancer, and immune disorders such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) and the Fc gamma receptors (Fc?R) may be closely linked in the pathogenesis of these diseases, because they play closely complementary roles in directing how immune cells, especially dendritic cells (DC), process and respond to IgG-complexed Ag (IgG IC). Studies have shown that FcRn begins directing the immune response to IgG IC only after IgG IC have been delivered to acidic endosomes, deep inside the cell, because FcRn only interacts with IgG IC in acidic conditions. Fc?R, therefore, plays an important role in this process, by delivering IgG IC from outside the cell to the endosomes, where it appears to handoff IgG IC to FcRn, normally present in the endosome. Importantly, the common H131 variant of Fc?RIIa has been genetically associated with risk of developing inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and cancer. Because FcRn appears to play a central role common to all Fc?R, it may be a common link enabling Fc?R genes to confer risk of disease to individuals possessing those genes. However, the details of how FcRn and Fc?R orchestrate the ?handoff? of IgG IC and how the downstream effects are directed by FcRn remain unknown. Discovering the details of the intimate coordination between FcRn and Fc?R could lead to the identification of new targets for developing better treatments for some infections, cancers and autoinflammatory diseases. The objectives of this application are to determine the details of FcRn-Fc?R cooperation, and outline how the IBD risk-associated Fc?RIIa contributes to IBD. My central hypothesis is that FcRn in DC regulates key immune functions through discrete signaling networks initiated by coordination with Fc?RIIa, that separately regulate cytokine signaling and cytoskeletal alterations. I propose to test this hypothesis through three Specific Aims. The first set of studies (Aim 1) will use biochemical techniques to show how FcRn and Fc?R interact or cooperate, and will seek to discover what other cellular components may be involved. The next studies (Aim 2), will investigate how FcRn induces immune signals to direct the immune response to the encountered Ag. The final set of studies (Aim 3) test an antibody that blocks FcRn in mouse models of IgG-dependent colitis (a model of IBD) to test the hypothesis that Fc?RIIa depends on FcRn to cause disease The rationale for this proposal is that elucidating the mechanisms of FcRn regulation of mucosal immune responses and cooperation with Fc?R will clarify the pathogenesis of IBD and reveal opportunities for therapeutic intervention to ameliorate inflammation. These studies are innovative and may benefit human health, because they investigate a newly discovered immune receptor interaction, seek to explain the mechanism of how Fc?RIIa confers risk of disease, and may provide new targets for developing new therapeutics for Fc?R-related diseases."
"9235732","Project Summary An estimated 1 in 6 children in the U.S. and over 200 million children in the developing world are not reaching their full developmental potential. Although fungicide use is growing exponentially in the United States and globally, a significant gap exists in scientific knowledge about the neurodevelopmental toxicity of fungicides. Ethylenebisdithiocarbamates, or EBDCs, are commonly-used fungicides in agricultural production as well as in floriculture and horticulture. EBDCs are metabolized into a more toxic carcinogenic and teratogenic compound, ethylenethiourea (ETU), which has been associated with decreased serum thyroxine levels, increased thyroid stimulation hormone levels, and thyroid gland disorders. Although research indicates that prenatal ETU exposure may cause maternal and neonatal thyroid dysfunction, potentially leading to adverse outcomes including pregnancy loss, preterm delivery, intrauterine growth restriction, disruptions in fetal central nervous system and brain development and impaired cognitive and motor function, no epidemiological studies to date has evaluated the effects of prenatal exposure to ETU on newborn thyroid function or the subsequent neurobehavioral development of infants. This study proposes to follow pregnant women and their infants, incorporating prenatal urinary biomarkers of ETU exposure, survey data of environmental ETU exposure and key social and economic factors, and sensitive growth and neurobehavioral developmental measures. We hypothesize that higher maternal urinary ETU levels during pregnancy will be associated with delayed growth measures and lower cognitive, visual, and psychomotor developmental assessment scores at birth, 6, 12, and 18 months of age and that this association will be mediated through an impact on newborn thyroid function. The proposed research takes advantage of a unique opportunity to investigate this question in a highly exposed population in Ecuador. We will enroll 420 pregnant women at 10-12 weeks gestation and follow them through pregnancy up to 18 months post-partum. We will obtain monthly prenatal urine samples. We will obtain neonatal blood samples to assess thyroid hormone levels at birth. We will administer highly sensitive tests (BSID-III, Teller cards) that will assess cognitive, motor, language, and social-behavioral development, and visual function in infants. Infants will also be measured for growth and nutritional status. At each visit throughout the study, data will be collected on working conditions, stress, environmental exposures in home and work environments, social support, maternal health and lifestyle factors, socio-economic and demographic factors. We will quantify levels of prenatal ETU exposure and will analyze levels by trimester. We will assess associations between prenatal urinary ETU metabolite levels and infant developmental outcomes and will run a multivariate path analysis to test for a mediating effect of newborn thyroid dysfunction on this association. This study will further scientific understanding of the developmental consequences of exposure to fungicides, which have become the most commonly used pesticides in agricultural industry in the U.S. and globally."

Previous studies have demonstrated that the depolarization of human leukemic T cells dampens TCR stimulation- induced calcium signaling through non-voltage gated Ca2+ channels in the cell, a canonical marker of T cell activation. However, a fundamental understanding of how membrane depolarization regulates the activation state of a T cell is unclear. Due to the size of the TCR-CD3 complex and its location in the membrane, it has been challenging to obtain structural information about the whole complex. It is known that there are charged residues in the transmembrane (TM) region and polybasic residues in the cytoplasmic domain that might play a role in complex assembly and regulating immunomodulatory tyrosine availability for phosphorylation by kinases in the cytoplasm, respectively. Previous work by co-sponsor Bezanilla has illustrated the ability of charged residues in TM proteins to move upon changes in membrane voltage in a manner that is crucial to cellular function. The main question this proposal aims to address is how depolarization of the T cell membrane can regulate the conformation and function of the TCR-CD3 complex. We will use two novel free-standing silicon nanomaterials that the applicant recently developed in the Tian laboratory to optically depolarize the membranes of T cells. We will then perform Förster resonance energy transfer imaging to examine how CD3 cytoplasmic subunits move relative to the membrane and how TCR-CD3 TM subunits move relative to the TCR extracellular domains, upon nanomaterial induced depolarization and stimulation with various purified peptide- MHC ligands produced in the Adams laboratory. We will also study changes in the expression and phosphorylation status of proximal and downstream T cell signaling proteins in the Adams laboratory upon membrane depolarization and TCR stimulation. The results of this work will provide biophysical and functional insight into how plasma membrane potential can regulate T cell activation with potential implications for therapeutic strategies in autoimmunity diseases."
"9540472","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Amblyopia (`lazy eye'), the loss of visual acuity in one eye that cannot be corrected by glasses, is the most common cause of monocular vision loss worldwide and affects 3-5% of population. In addition to the acuity loss, a high proportion of amblyopic patients lack binocular function and depth perception. The combined loss of acuity and depth perception has a significant impact on the quality of life in amblyopes. The standard clinical treatment is to patch the non-amblyopic fellow eye to promote the use of the amblyopic eye in children. Adults are usually not treated, because amblyopia has long been considered untreatable in adults. With occlusion therapy, the success rate ranges from 60% to 80% with 20-25% recurrence following treatment, leaving about one third of affected children with amblyopia that persists into adulthood. This project seeks to understand the failure of current treatment approaches and proposes alternative therapies for those amblyopic patients who do not respond well to the conventional regimen. We believe that visual suppression, the fundamental factor in amblyopic visual loss, is a great barrier to treatment. We propose that visual suppression in amblyopia may be a form of long-term attentional neglect and that learning to attend to the amblyopic eye may overcome this neglect and improve visual function in the amblyopic eye. To test this hypothesis, Aim 1 will examine cortical suppression in amblyopic individuals with and without residual binocular function, because these two groups of patients have different treatment outcomes. Non-binocular amblyopes are more difficult to treat and often regress following treatment. Aim 2 will measure both the strength and the latency of selective visual attention in individuals with amblyopia, and will correlate these results with the suppression measurements in Aim 1. Aim 3 will investigate whether manipulating attention in the amblyopic eye can modulate cortical suppression. Aim 4 will test the hypothesis that suppression can be alleviated and visual function will be improved by training the amblyopic eye with high attention-demand tasks. We will use both conventional perceptual learning tasks (low attention-demand tasks) and high attention-demand tasks to train individuals with amblyopia. We will track and evaluate visual function (acuity and stereopsis), depth of suppression, and attentional modulation during training by using visual psychophysics coupled to frequency-tagged source-localized EEG measurements. The knowledge gained from this study will contribute significantly to a broader understanding of the neural basis of visual suppression and the development of amblyopia. Our results will shed light on why amblyopic therapy often fails, and will indicate more efficient treatment strategies, especially for those who do not response well to conventional treatment."
"9457045","Summary Clonal expansion of lymphocytes during the development and immune responses is a hallmark feature of adaptive immunity. The transcription factor c-MYC is essential to establish metabolically activate states in activated lymphocytes and allow them to proceed into rapid division cycles. The c-MYC driven clonal expansion is beneficial for host protection by quantitatively amplifying functional lymphocyte populations. B lymphocytes also qualitatively improve antibody responses through MYC-dependent proliferative bursts in the Germinal centers. While c-MYC is thus very important for protective immunity, its aberrant expression has also been associated with many cancers in humans and mice. Indeed, MYC-expressing proliferating B cells in GCs and their precursors in the bone marrow are the major sources of B cell malignancies in humans, which might be worsened by the concurrent presence of genomic insults secondary to activities of RAG proteins and AID that not only target antigen receptor loci but also a number of cryptic targets. Then, how GC B cells or B cell precursors minimize the risk of deleterious outcomes while facing the need for MYC-driven clonal expansion? We have recently found that proliferating lymphocytes temporally restrict c-MYC expression during their clonal expansion. In the GCs, B cells use c-MYC only for the initiation of proliferative program and utilize its downstream factor AP4 to continue their divisions. This c-MYC-AP4 transcription factor hand-off is required for the requisite GC responses for the development of protective antibodies against chronic viral infection. Since this cascade allows GC B cells to spatially and temporally segregate c-MYC expression in the light zone and AID activity in the dark zone, this mechanism may indirectly or passively contribute to protection of GC B cells if AP4 is less oncogenic compared to c-MYC. Unexpectedly, we have obtained preliminary results indicating that AP4 functions as a tumor suppressor MYC-driven B cell leukemia in a completely independent set of experiments. These results suggest that the MYC-AP4 axis is essential to support requisite B cell proliferation for protective immunity and simultaneously protect proliferating B cells from oncogenic transformation. This may highlight a novel, counterintuitive function of a MYC-induced gene regulatory pathway that functions as a tumor suppressor. In this grant, we will study the mechanisms of MYC-independent maintenance of AP4 by T cell help signals, which is necessary for durable proliferation of normal B cells and those of AP4-mediated tumor suppression."
"9417642","PROJECT SUMMARY Despite recent improvements, we are still a long way from consistently delivering high quality care to hospitalized patients. Most adults requiring hospitalization are admitted for medical conditions, yet the optimal model of care for these patients is yet to be established. Current care delivery models lack the ability to optimally coordinate care on a daily basis and improve performance over time. A growing body of research has tested interventions to redesign aspects of care delivery for hospitalized medical patients. These interventions improve processes and culture, but the evidence that patient outcomes have improved is equivocal. Importantly, most studies have examined the effect of single interventions in isolation, yet these interventions are better conceptualized as complementary and mutually reinforcing components of a redesigned clinical microsystem. Clinical microsystems are the front line care giving units where patients, families, and care teams meet. We developed a set of complementary, mutually reinforcing interventions based on available evidence and anchored in a clinical microsystem framework. The 5 interventions include: 1) Unit-based Physician Teams, 2) Unit Nurse-Physician Co-leadership, 3) Enhanced Interdisciplinary Rounds, 4) Unit-level Performance Reports, 5) Patient Engagement Activities. Our long term goal is to discover and disseminate the optimal model of care to improve outcomes for hospitalized patients. Our specific objective for this proposal is to implement a set of evidence-based complementary interventions across a range of clinical microsystems, identify factors and strategies associated with successful implementation, and evaluate the impact on quality. We will use mentored implementation, i.e., coaching by external professionals who are experts in the area of focus, to help facilitate change. We will enroll 4 hospitals in this quality improvement mentored implementation study. Our hypothesis is that uptake of the complementary components of the intervention set will result in improvements in teamwork climate and patient outcomes. Specific Aims of the Redesigning Systems to Improve Quality for Hospitalized Patients include 1) conduct a multi-site mentored implementation quality improvement study in which each site adapts and implements complementary interventions to improve care for medical patients, 2) evaluate the effect of the intervention set on teamwork climate and patient outcomes related to safety, patient experience, and efficiency, and 3) assess how site-specific contextual factors interact with the variation in the intensity and fidelity of implementation to effect teamwork and patient outcomes. The findings generated from this study will be directly applicable to hospitals throughout the U.S. and our partnership with the Society of Hospital Medicine, the American Nurses Association, and the Institute for Patient- and Family-Centered Care will ensure effective dissemination and impact."
"9552364","PROJECT SUMMARY_____ __________________________________________ __ Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a leading cause of mortality and long-term disability worldwide. Over 1.7 million Americans suffer a TBI annually and up to 2% of the population currently lives with the long-term neurological consequences of a previous TBI, placing a $76.5 billion annual economic burden on society. Preventative measures reduce injury incidence and/or severity, yet one-third of hospitalized TBI patients die from injuries that are secondary to the initial trauma. Cerebral edema is a life-threatening neurological complication that promotes elevated ICP and leads to clinical deterioration in the hours and days after a TBI. Unfortunately, neurosurgical approaches to control elevated ICP are limited and efficacious medical therapies to control cerebral edema are lacking, presenting a critical barrier to improving patient prognoses after TBI. The objective of this proposal is to test the overarching hypothesis that activation of neutrophilic toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) promotes the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) after TBI, initiating a detrimental immune cascade that culminates in neurological deterioration. Specific Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that TLR4 activation mediates NET formation after TBI. Proposed mechanistic studies will demonstrate a key regulatory role for activation of the TLR4 signaling pathway in the formation of NETs after TBI. Specific Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that peptidylarginine deiminase 4 (PAD4) promotes cerebral edema after TBI. Proposed mechanistic studies will use genetic and pharmacological approaches to implicate PAD4, a mediator of TLR4-induced histone hypercitrullination in human and mouse neutrophils, in NET formation and neurovascular injury after TBI. Specific Aim 3 will test the hypothesis that NETs trap macrophages in the brain after TBI. These studies will identify NETs as a novel mediator of brain macrophage infiltration/polarization after TBI. Proposed translational studies also will support the repurposing of recombinant human DNase (rhDNase), a safe, FDA-approved therapeutic in widespread clinical use for non- neurological diseases, allowing rapid clinical translation into TBI patients. Expected outcomes of the proposed research include the identification of NETs as a functional initiator of secondary neurological injury after TBI, establishing a framework for the development of innovative therapeutics to reduce neurovascular injury and improve patient outcomes after TBI. ."
"9426701","PROJECT SUMMARY The central focus of this Multi-PI R01 research proposal is the structure-function characterization of the human cannabinoid receptor 2 (CB2), a key protein component of the endocannabinoid system. We aim to develop a fundamental understanding of the structural basis of CB2 function, with the ultimate translational goal of establishing a robust structure-based drug design (SBDD) program. The ECS is a complex network of lipid ligands, receptors, and metabolic enzymes involved in a wide range of important physiological processes. There have been important implications that targeting CB2 may be useful as a means for treating inflammation, pain, neurological disorders and addiction. As with other G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), CB2 can exhibit preferential signaling events in response to different ligands. This functional selectivity offers the opportunity to refine therapeutic approaches, to improve beneficial properties, and reduce side effect liability. The study will provide the structural basis for the design and development of pharmacologically distinct CB2-selective compounds as useful biological probes and/or leads for the future development of therapeutics. To enhance our effort in obtaining high quality crystal structures, we shall use carefully designed ligands with high affinities and selectivities for CB2, and which are also capable of tight attachment at or near the receptor?s binding domain(s) coupled with their abilities to form crystallizable ligand-receptor complexes. The study has three specific aims: (1) Design and synthesize novel irreversible ligands representing key classes of CB2 selective compounds with distinct functional profiles. (2) Extensive characterization of the newly synthesized ligands in order to identify compounds with pharmacologically diverse profiles, including the partial agonists, inverse agonists, neutral antagonists and allosteric modulators. The crystallization candidates and their chemical derivatives will also be characterized for their reversible binding nature using functional assays. (3) Develop a clear understanding of CB2 ligand binding sites by determining the 3-D structures of the several receptor-ligand complexes. Towards these goals, several crystal structures will be solved to better understand molecular recognition, signaling, and to assist in the design of novel compounds that could then serve as prototypes for later generation leads and drug candidates."
"9301243","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a health burden worldwide that is highly prevalent and deadly but also preventable. African Americans (AAs) suffer disproportionately from CRC in the US, and biological factors underlying these disparities remain understudied. Environmental exposures, such as active vitamin D ( 1?,25(OH)2D3) , interact with normal colon to modify CRC development. If we could understand how these interactions differ between individuals or populations, they could be harnessed to identify those at highest CRC risk and potentially identify new ways to prevent this cancer. Until now, traditional models could not study host-environment interactions between individuals in human colon. To address this gap, we have established an experimental framework that uses primary ex vivo colon culture and human organoid culture to study inter-individual and inter-ethnic differences in responses to environmental exposures. Our initial work has identified a promising candidate, uridine phosphorylase 1 (UPP1), a key enzyme of uridine homeostasis and pyrimidine salvage that showed significant inter-ethnic differences in transcriptional response to 1?,25(OH)2D3. A knock out mouse of uridine phosphorylase led to spontaneous colon tumors due to DNA damage providing rationale for studying this candidate in the context of CRC disparities. In this exploratory study, we will test the hypothesis that 1?,25(OH)2D3  regulates uridine homeostasis and DNA damage in the colon, and that this regulation differs between populations (Aim 1). Having found that our experimental framework is productive and promising, we will extend it to identify inter-ethnic differences in gene expression and in chromatin accessibility in response to vitamin D with greater power compared to our preliminary study (Aim 2). Ultimately, this exploratory work is the basis for larger, comprehensive studies of inter-individual and inter-ethnic host-environment interactions in CRC susceptibility. In an era where the need for precision medicine at the individual and population level is recognized, our studies will determine how 1?,25(OH)2D3 responses differ across populations that eventually might lead to personalized vitamin D-based interventions for CRC prevention especially in AAs."

The WV Bureau for Public Health and our other partners identify disparities related to tobacco and to obesity and metabolic disease (OMD) as top health priorities. Since 1994, the WV Prevention Research Center has collaborated with these partners to transform public health policy and practice through community-engaged research and evaluation, with emphasis on tobacco and OMD. We propose to expand our impact through the following Specific Aims: (1) grow and sustain a multi-disciplinary academic-based center for innovative, community- engaged health promotion and disease prevention research and evaluation; (2) collaborate with state and local health departments, community agencies and other community partners to address state-identified health priorities and disparities; (3) foster, conduct, and translate community-engaged applied prevention research and evaluation to improve public health outcomes, practice and policy; (4) strengthen the capacity of public health practitioners, faculty, staff, students, community members, and partner organizations to conduct and apply prevention research to address practical public health problems; and (5) partner with state and local departments of health and education to: (5a) define and document current school physical education (PE) and recess practices among elementary schools in WV and compare student health and academic outcomes based on school practices; (5b) compare the impact of two school-based PE and activity interventions to standard PE based on student- and school-level outcomes; and (5c) rapidly translate research findings into environmental and policy recommendations at the state and local levels to increase student access to effective physical activity and PE. Aim 5 relates to our applied childhood obesity intervention project that addresses a CDC Winnable Battle. It also addresses gaps about the efficacy/effectiveness of prevention strategies for a priority population (i.e., rural) and a gap identified in the physical activity interventions' review in the Guide to Community Preventive Services. This multi-method project involves primary and secondary data analysis, including direct (accelerometer) and observed measures of student physical activity levels, aerobic fitness, academic achievement, and health risk factors such as overweight/obesity and elevated blood pressure. It employs a cross sectional design (Study Aim 1) and a randomized control trial (Aim 2); Aim 3 addresses knowledge translation. We hypothesize that accomplishment of all five Aims requires mutually-beneficial engagement with state/local public health and education, communities, providers, and to ensure partner trust and research relevance, and facilitate the rapid translation of applied research and evaluation to public health policies and practices that address key health disparities. We expect to provide fair, sustainable, and cost- effective research, training, and service by delivering tangible products that can be used to improve population health and vitality for years to come."
"9360009","The sensory and motor impairments associated with peripheral neuropathy lead to poor physical functioning, postural control and balance. These changes affect the activities of daily living and increase the risk of falling, subsequently leading to increased morbidity and decreased quality of life. [In an effort to maximize functional recovery from injuries, many veterans will undergo surgical procedures to their affected limbs.] Anesthesiologists commonly use local anesthetics (LAs) to perform peripheral nerve blocks that result in temporary control of pain during or after a surgical procedure. Peripheral nerve damage can occur as a complication from peripheral nerve blocks and the mechanism of injury remains unknown. It has been well documented that all LAs are toxic to neurons. Because LAs are frequently applied to sites in our veterans where peripheral nerves are diseased or injured, understanding their effects on injured neurons has important implications for clinical practice.  Our long-term goal is [to maximize functional recovery in veterans suffering from nerve impairments] by understanding how LAs affect pre-existing peripheral nerve injuries. The objective is to determine if LAs worsen peripheral neuron cell death and/or slow functional recovery [in a chronic model] of peripheral nerve injury. Our central hypothesis is that previously injured neurons will be more susceptible to the toxicity of longer-acting LAs and this will result in increased neuron cell death and delayed or absent functional recovery in mice with a previous peripheral nerve injury compared to mice with no injury. The rationale for the proposed research is that an improved understanding of the effects of LAs on neurons will help identify veterans at higher risk for permanent neural deficits after peripheral nerve blocks and/or decrease the risk of neural deficit following peripheral nerve blocks. To test our central hypothesis we will pursue the following specific aims:  Specific Aim 1: Determine if select LAs cause peripheral neuron cell death alone or exacerbate peripheral nerve cell death after a peripheral nerve axotomy or crush in a well-established mouse model of peripheral nerve injury. Select LAs or placebo (saline) will be applied to an intact facial nerve (sham injury), 1 week after a facial nerve axotomy, and 1 week after a facial nerve crush injury. Neuron survival will be determined 4-weeks after LA treatment by cell counts that compare between injured and uninjured nerves.  Specific Aim 2: Determine if select LAs attenuate functional recovery after a peripheral nerve crush injury in a well-established mouse model of peripheral nerve injury. Select LAs or placebo (saline) will be applied to the facial nerve 1 week after a facial nerve crush injury. Neuronal regeneration will be measured by twice daily analysis of functional recovery from a nerve crush injury.  [Specific Aim 3: Explore changes in gene expression of injured neurons treated with LAs identified from Aims 1 and 2. Mice will undergo a facial nerve axtotomy then select local anesthetic applied to the nerve 1 week after injury. We will then sacrifice animals at 0, 1, 3, 7, and 28 days following treatment and use laser capture microdissection to collect tissue from the injured and uninjured facial nuclei to analyze genes associated with regeneration, apoptosis, stress response and sodium channel components.]  The expected outcomes of the proposed research are to identify commonly used LAs that worsen neuron cell death and/or slow functional recovery after a peripheral nerve injury, and to further characterize changes in gene expression. Such results are expected to have an important positive impact, by identifying patients at higher risk for permanent neural deficits or help identify LAs with safer neurotoxicity profiles. The knowledge gained from these studies may impact how clinicians choose appropriate patients to receive peripheral nerve blocks and/or influence which LAs are used on at-risk patients."

Recent groundbreaking work suggests a role for intracellular liquid phase transitions in governing the assembly and organization of functional protein assemblies or granules with liquid-like properties. This proposal seeks to test the hypothesis that misregulation of intracellular liquid phase separation leads to detrimental protein aggregation. In the mentored phase, Aim 1 seeks to define the physicochemical parameters and phase landscape of stress granule proteins implicated in disease. This aim will be achieved through applying principles of engineering and soft matter physics along with unique rheological methodologies previously developed by Dr. Elbaum. Aim 2 seeks to determine the relationship between liquid phases, aggregation and toxicity in vivo as a function of aging and stress. Using the C. elegans model system, this aim will establish whether liquid protein phases prevent or promote amyloid formation, and garner insight into whether aging and/or stress contribute to regulation of protein assembly. In the independent phase, Aim 3 seeks to identify molecular pathways regulating protein assembly and further resolve the molecular mechanisms underlying regulation. This aim will be achieved through a unique multi-scale approach combining single molecule techniques, material science methodologies, and organismal level interrogation. Together, this innovative strategy will offer novel insight into the biogenesis of pathological protein aggregation, and define new pathways and distinct molecular targets for therapeutic interventions aimed at preventing or reducing the health burdens of neurodegenerative disease."

In addition, capacity needs to be built for testing for  other  AES  pathogens  in  the  country.  In  addition,  good  laboratory  systems,  including standardized testing and reporting procedures, strong quality assurance programmes and and linkages with global specialized referral laboratories, need to be established to ensure quality and provide technical support to national laboratories in India.

"9451132","ABSTRACT  Top-down feedback connections between ?higher? and ?lower? brain areas are quite common, but their functional role remains a mystery. This general principle applies to the olfactory system, in which the olfactory bulb receives dense feedback innervation from its cortical targets. Here, we propose techniques with which feedback neurons can be targeted by a viral/transgenic intersectional strategy in mice. Using this strategy, we will identify feedback neurons during electrophysiological recordings by optogenetic tagging. In addition, we will exclusively silence the feedback axons in olfactory bulb, in a way that will not affect the feedforward connections of these neurons.  In the timeframe of this proposal, we will apply these techniques to determine the role of one olfactory cortical area, the anterior olfactory nucleus, in one olfactory computation: sensing odor concentration changes over time. This computation is very important to a mouse, because sensing concentration changes over time can enable a mouse to locate odor sources. We have recently reported that a substantial subset of neurons in olfactory bulb explicitly represent concentration changes. Because inhalation parses odor input into discrete, intermittent samples, computing concentration change requires a memory of stimulation during past inhalations. We hypothesize that anterior olfactory nucleus provides this putative memory signal via its feedback projection. This hypothesis predicts that responses of feedback neurons will represent the previous sniff's odor concentration, even after the stimulus has ceased. In Aim 1 of this proposal, we will test this prediction by delivering dynamic concentration stimuli to awake mice, while we record electrophysiologically from neuronal ensembles in which we can use optogenetic tagging to distinguish feedback from non-feedback neurons. Another prediction of our hypothesis is that feedback signals are essential to computing concentration changes. In Aim 2, we will test for a causal role of feedback in this computation, by silencing feedback axons in the olfactory bulb while we record the responses of olfactory bulb neurons to odor concentration dynamics. With the proposed experiments, we will determine how and whether anterior olfactory nucleus participates in concentration change sensing.  In the longer term, the methods we propose here will enable us to determine the role of feedback neurons in other olfactory areas, such as piriform or lateral entorhinal cortices, in sensing concentration changes, as well as other relevant olfactory computations. Importantly, the optogenetic silencing strategy we propose is compatible with behavioral experiments, because we will selectively silence feedback axons without affecting activity in the neurons' cell bodies. Thus, feedback can be dissected from feedforward signals, which will make experimental results easier to interpret. Ultimately, the techniques established here will facilitate our big picture goal of elucidating the role of top-down feedback in neuronal computation."
"9406520","Abstract Diabetic Macular Edema (DME) is a vision-threatening stage in Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) that can result in legal blindness. The biochemical mechanisms that drive DME progression are not well understood and treatments address only portions of the disease pathology. The available treatment options vary widely from injectable anti- VEGF to injectable steroids to laser treatments, and carry a heavy cost burden to the US, at over $500 million per year. Currently, there are two large problems with the available treatment options: the efficacy of each treatment is highly variable from patient to patient, and sustained responses are unpredictable. Given the significant increase in diagnoses and the enormous public cost burden, there is a need to develop novel functional biomarker diagnostics which assist physicians in choosing the most effective therapy for each patient. We are developing a companion diagnostic assay for DME which can be used in a clinic setting to allow physicians to predict outcome to anti-VEGF treatment, the first-line of therapy for DME. This assay will enable personalized therapy for each DME patient, by determining appropriate therapy before DME treatment is started, when to switch treatments, and when treatment can be safely stopped (which is currently not possible). Furthermore, as the assay is composed of biomarkers specifically for DME, it can be utilized by pharmaceutical companies for discovery, development, and testing of novel or repurposed drugs for DME. We hypothesize that proteomic analysis of relevant pathways in the vitreous proteome and correlation with clinical symptoms of DME patients receiving anti-VEGF treatment will enable us to develop a predictive biomarker panel for anti-VEGF response in DME. We will use Reverse Phase Protein Microarray assay to detect proteins in vitreous samples collected from DME patients receiving anti-VEGF treatment over time. Targets to be tested include proteins associated with angiogenesis/proliferation, inflammation/ immune response, ischemia/hypoxia and apoptosis/cell survival. Statistical analysis will be performed to examine whether vitreous protein levels are correlated to changes in retinal thickness and visual acuity in response to monthly anti-VEGF treatment. The following specific aims are designed to test our hypothesis and to identify a biomarker panel that predicts treatment response: (1) Identify biochemical pathways involved in changes in retinal thickness and visual acuity in response to anti-VEGF treatment, and (2) Identify a panel of biomarkers that is predictive of changes in retinal thickness and visual acuity in response to anti-VEGF treatment Successful completion of this project will lead to the development of a predictive biomarker panel in the form of a companion diagnostic kit that assists clinicians in determining the most effective therapy for each DME patient. Furthermore, our findings will allow us to collaborate with pharma companies in development of new drug targets."
"9396870","Abstract/Summary  Nitrate is the most commonly found contaminant in the world's aquifers and a major contaminant of drinking water in the U.S. Nitrate causes fetal growth restriction (FGR), low birth weight (LBW), and birth defects (BD) in studies of experimental animals, but only at high concentrations. High levels of nitrate in drinking water are also a well-recognized cause of a potentially fatal form of anemia (methemoglobinemia or blue baby syndrome) in newborns. However, surprisingly few epidemiologic studies have examined the risk of adverse birth outcomes from contemporary lower levels of nitrate in water. There is suggestive evidence from these studies that nitrate in drinking water may increase the risk of FGR, preterm delivery (PTD) and neural tube, limb deficiencies and cleft palate/lip BD. Most of the prior studies are limited by their ecologic design, small size, uncertain estimates of exposure, poor control of other risk factors, and lack of consideration of dietary intake of nitrate and nitrite. There is a clear need for larger and better studies at contemporary levels of exposure, which this proposal is designed to address.  The goal of this proposal is to evaluate whether maternal consumption of nitrate contaminated water increases the risk of adverse birth outcomes. Specifically we aim to examine whether nitrate in drinking water is associated with an increased risk of: 1) PTD (< 37 weeks) and very PTD (<32 weeks), 2) FGR based on being small (<10th percentile) for gestational age, LBW (<2.5 kg among infants born at term), reduced birth head circumference and body length, 3) neural tube, limb deficiencies and cleft palate/lip BD, and 4) interacts with the use of nitrosatable drugs for BD, which has been reported in one study.  To address these aims we will capitalize on unique resources available in Denmark, which permit estimation of concentrations of nitrate in drinking water for all addresses and linkage of these estimates with complete address histories, data on birth outcomes, prescription drug use and other risk factors (e.g. maternal smoking, parity, and socio-economic status) from Danish registries to create a population based cohort study of all liveborn singleton births in Denmark from 1997 to 2013 (~1 million births). We will also link these data with the Danish National Birth Cohort (DNBC), which has extensive information on diet (for ~67000 births) which will be used for estimating dietary intake of nitrate and nitrite. The DNBC also has useful data on water consumption, drug use (prescription and non-prescription), and extensive information on other risk factors. Our study will be the largest ever conducted, with comprehensive data on nitrate intake from water and food and on other risk factors. Our findings should be highly influential in the development of policies and recommendations concerning nitrate in drinking water, which would have a very large public health impact given the ubiquity of nitrate in drinking water and the severity of these outcomes."
"9309290","Project Summary/Abstract The long-term objectives of the proposed research are to improve our ability to identify the genetic cause of disease for patients with inherited retinal degenerations (IRDs), and to identify genetic modifiers of the severity of IRDs. Accurate genetic diagnosis for patients affected by IRDs is desirable for multiple reasons, including provision of information about potential therapies, disease prognosis, and risk to other family members. This is especially true now that gene augmentation therapy for two genetic forms of IRD has been shown to be safe and effective in early clinical trials. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) based approaches make it possible to sequence all 250+ known IRD disease genes at the same time. Interpretation of the NGS data, and accurate identification of the genetic cause of disease for IRD patients remains difficult, due in part to the highly variable nature of the human genome, and the practice of focusing genetic analyses on genes associated with specific clinical diagnoses, which is sub-optimal due to highly variable and overlapping clinical phenotypes of IRDs. It is hypothesized that the accuracy of genetic diagnoses for IRD patients could be improved through the unbiased assessment of variants in all IRD genes. To make this possible, in Aim 1 it is proposed to perform genetic diagnostic testing of all known IRD genes for a cohort of 4,278 genetically unsolved patients with IRDs for whom longitudinal clinical data is available. The genetic testing will include the analysis of large insertions and deletions. The focus of Aim 2 is discovery and validation of genetic modifiers of IRD disease phenotypes. A consistent observation is that patients with the same genetic cause of IRD can have notably different disease severity. It is hypothesized that variants in other IRD disease genes are the most likely source of influence on disease severity. For these studies, gene-based association testing will be performed using the sequence variants identified in IRD disease genes by the studies in Aim 1 to identify modifiers of disease phenotype. These efforts will be focused initially on patients with selected primary mutations in the three genes that are the most common causes of IRD, RHO, USH2A and RPGR. Preliminary data confirm notable variation in the severity of disease in patients already known to have disease caused by mutations in these genes. Through the proposed genetic studies, we expect to identify at least five separate gene-defect groups, each with 100 patients or more to search for disease modifiers. The activity of candidate modifier alleles identified by these studies will then be tested in zebrafish and on mRNA obtained from patient?s blood or fibroblasts. The proposed research is an essential step toward complete understanding of the complex genetic basis of IRDs that cannot be accomplished by identifying new disease genes alone. The results obtained in these studies will lead to improved diagnostic accuracy, and facilitate development of treatments to limit vision loss from these disorders through identification of pathways that modulate disease severity."
"9449930","Project Summary/Abstract The goal of this exploratory research project is to improve understanding about the mechanisms by which mammalian neural circuits decode environmental chemosensory information and use that information to support survival and reproduction. Specifically, the proposed research will investigate cell type-specific neural codes in the parallel brain pathways of the mouse accessory olfactory system (AOS). The AOS possesses a single neural circuit, the accessory olfactory bulb (AOB), that links the peripheral sensory neurons in the nose to powerful regions in the limbic system, but it remains unclear how information about naturally-occurring blends of social chemosignals is extracted through the AOB and its downstream targets. The exploratory research plan will utilize existing ex vivo approaches and collaboratively develop in vivo multi-site multielectrode AOS recording methods to investigate neuronal ensemble in the AOB and its downstream targets. This research will produce data linking sensory experience to ?mission critical? mammalian behavioral states, and improve our understanding of mammalian physiology. The gains made by these studies and the establishment of new experimental and analytical tools will ultimately benefit human health."
"9409238","Abstract Pancreatic cancers are devastating diseases with five year survival rate less than 7%. Currently, there is no effective treatment for advanced disease. One major barrier to efficacy of anti-tumor therapeutics is the dense desmoplastic stromal response. Evidence suggests that cancer associated pancreatic stellate cells (CAPaSC) produce the stromal collagen. The ECM laid down by CAPaSC is considered to be one of the major contributors of resistance to established therapies of the diseases. Depleting CAPaSC and altering vessel density could significantly improve efficacy of existing pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) treatments. However, currently, there are no approved therapies that are able to deplete CAPaSCs in PDAC. We have developed a novel therapeutic protein (ProAgio) using rational protein design. ProAgio is designed to target integrin ?v?3 at a novel site (not the ligand binding site). ProAgio specifically induces apoptosis of integrin ?v?3 expressing cells with high efficacy by a novel mechanism of drug action (recruiting & activating caspase 8 at cytoplasmic domain of???). We reasoned that, since both CAPaSC and angiogenic endothelial cells express high levels of integrin ?v?3, and since ProAgio is very effective in inducing apoptosis of integrin ?v?3 expressing cells, ProAgio should both deplete CAPaSC and eliminate new blood vessels in and around pancreatic tumors. This unique strategy may prove advantageous in treatment of PDAC. This early phase STTR research project aims at testing effectiveness and safety of this newly developed protein drug candidate in treatment of pancreatic cancer in animal models. This research project will provide proof-of-principle evidence for further development of ProAgio as pancreatic cancer treatment drug, an unmet medical needs. The specific aims of this project are: (1) We will examine the anti- tumor efficacy of ProAgio and its effect on the tumor microenvironment in an immune-competent mouse model of PDAC. (2) We will also examine the effects of ProAgio in combination with a FDA approved anti-cancer therapeutics. (3) Finally, to facilitate further development, we will test pre- clinical toxicity and PK properties of ProAgio in rodent. Our goal is that, through our study, we will introduce a new treatment approach for pancreatic cancer with novel mechanism of drug action."
"9313640","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT This proposal is to continue longitudinal follow-up of the population-based Michigan Lupus Epidemiology & Surveillance (MILES) Program Cohort and Biobank. The overarching goal is to prospectively collect data and biospecimens that will allow for comprehensive investigations related to risk factors for lupus onset, progression, and comorbidities. To date, the baseline round of Cohort visits has been completed, and the first follow-up round of visits is ongoing. Detailed data collection encompasses measures related to sociodemographics, health/wellness, reproductive health, physical function, environmental exposures, lifestyle factors, and genetics. Lupus-specific measures, including disease activity indices, are measured for the SLE cases. The state-of-the-art biobank includes serum, plasma, DNA/RNA (from lymphocyte subsets), urine, hair, and toenail clippings. Biobank specimens are processed and stored in appropriate conditions to provide the capacity to perform assays including contemporary immunoassays, biomarkers of disease and exposure, and DNA methylation of relevant lymphocyte subsets. Major thematic areas that the MILES Cohort & Biobank is designed to support include epigenetics, environmental epidemiology, and renal lupus. The MILES Cohort will thus serve as a robust platform for ongoing and future research investigations that are relevant to the full spectrum of lupus and its complications."
"9447717","This proposal outlines experiments that will provide mechanistic insights into and accelerate the medicinal development of small molecules that perturb the function of the ClpP peptidase in M. tuberculosis, the deadliest bacterial pathogen. The Mtb ClpP peptidase is an atypically complex, barrel-shaped assemblage of fourteen subunits that degrades proteins through associations with ATP-dependent chaperones that recognize and unfold substrates. In the past five years, my collaborator, Prof. Robert Sauer at MIT and I have made significant investments of time and effort in the functional reconstitution of the heterotetradecameric ClpP and accessory ATPases (ClpX and ClpC1) from Mtb. With that success, we have been able to characterize our rationally designed modulators of ClpP activity. The voluminous preliminary data (much of which is published) that we have generated provide a clear roadmap for the proposed research. They will yield insights into protein homeostasis in bacteria that can be exploited in drug development and molecules that could be much needed additions to the dwindling armamentarium used in the fight against multi-drug resistant Mtb. Aim 1. Develop and characterize small molecule modulators of the Mtb ClpP system. This aim is centered in chemical synthesis and enzymology. One objective is the multi-gram synthesis of an optimized, mycobactericidal ADEP that inhibits the ClpP system for use in murine models of tuberculosis. Another is optimization of a novel ADEP fragment that kills Mtb by activation of its ClpP system. We will also synthesize rationally designed ClpP inhibitors lacking the pharmacological liabilities of the only known mechanism-based inhibitor (developed in our laboratories). Compounds will be evaluated in in vitro assays of Clp system activity. Aim 2. Assess activities of and resistance to ClpP modulators in living cultures of mycobacteria. This aim is focused on comparative evaluations of ClpP modulators in living cultures of mycobacteria- including assays of minimal inhibitory and bactericidal concentrations. We believe that identification of the substrates of the Mtb Clp system will reveal insights into the mechanisms of these compounds. By applying new proteomics technologies along with a well-established in vivo ClpP substrate trapping method to the M. smegmatis Clp system for the first time, we will identify its substrates in the protease's native state and as it is perturbed by modulators. We will also investigate the mechanisms of small molecules that potentiate ADEP activity against Mtb by as much as 16-fold (i.e., hypothetical suppressors of efflux and the tuberculosis drug bedaquiline). Aim 3. Assess activities of ClpP modulators in mouse models of tuberculosis. Though ADEPs cured certain bacterial infections in animals, they have not been studied in tuberculosis. In murine models of tuberculosis, Dr. William Bishai at Johns Hopkins will assess the efficacies of an optimized ADEP alone and in combination with bedaquiline, standard tuberculosis drug regimens, and a potentiator that we designed to act by suppression of ADEP efflux by Mtb. Analogous experiments will be performed with our Mtb ClpP activator."
"9420062","The civilian chemical threat spectrum, including chemical warfare agents, toxic industrial chemicals and agricultural chemicals exposes millions of people to risk of morbidity and mortality every day. The development of countermeasures to mitigate mass casualty risk by intentional or unintentional dissemination of chemical threats is of critical importance, and many of these threats have devastating effects on cellular respiration. proposed project aims to provide a therapeutic intervention for mitochondrial and metabolic inhibition by The supplying an alternative source of energy that can bypass inhibition of complex I (CI) of the electron transport chain. Such a therapeutic would mitigate the toxic effects of a wide range of chemical agents that directly or indirectly inhibit cellular respiration. As added innovation, this proposal will continue development of human mitochondrial assays for testing toxicity and pharmaceutical interventions program for the development of future compounds targeting inhibition of cellular respiration a platform of great value for the CounterACT and NIH Biodefense. Our preliminary data show that cell-permeable succinate can improve respiration in cells with impaired CI function due to rotenone exposure, a toxin known to inhibit CI. Given this promising data, we propose to investigate whether cell-permeable succinate given after a toxic exposure will improve chemically induced metabolic and mitochondrial dysfunction. Furthermore, we hypothesize that this therapeutic can be used to treat a wide range of clinically relevant chemical agents by supporting mitochondrial function. We aim to characterize the toxic effects on mitochondria using human blood cells collected from volunteers in vitro and in vivo rodent models and to evaluate cell-permeable succinate as a treatment. Specific Aim 1. Determine in vitro effects on mitochondrial function of selected chemical agents in human cells, and assess the capability of cell-permeable succinate prodrugs to attenuate toxic effects. Specific Aim 2. Determine the efficacy of cell-permeable succinate prodrugs using in vivo models of mitochondrial dysfunction and reduced cellular respiration due to chemical exposure."
"9265289","Zika virus (ZIKV), a flavivirus, has recently spread to the Americas and is currently associated with a major pandemic in human populations in South, Central, and North America. ZIKV infections in pregnant women has been associated with severe birth defects, notably microcephaly; thus, it is critical to understand the epidemiology and spread of this viral infection. ZIKV, which can be spread by mosquitos, was first isolated in Africa from non-human primates, suggesting that these animals may serve as a reservoir for the virus. However, much less is known about the reservoirs or spread of the virus in the Americas. Countries where outbreaks are occurring, including Brazil, Columbia, Ecuador and Mexico, are home to a number of species of Neotropical primates, and the human and non-human primate populations occupy overlapping areas. This suggests that there is the potential for these animals to be a reservoir for maintenance and spread of the virus in human populations. Our first aim is to determine whether Neotropical primates are a potential reservoir for ZIKV. We have assembled an expert team of primatologists, virologists, enteric infectious disease researchers, and epidemiologist who will work collaboratively to answer this question. We will sample 12 species of Neotropical primates at 8 field sites in 4 countries. We will determine the presence of active infection or carriage of ZIKV by quantitative RT-PCR, and we will test for antibodies against the virus as an indicator of prior exposure. Additionally we will obtain blood samples from human volunteers in proximal geographic areas to determine if human infection positively correlates with ZIKV presence in Neotropical primates. Molecular phylogenetic analysis of ZIKV gene sequences from human and non-human primates will help determine the epidemiology and spread of the virus in these populations. Because obtaining blood samples from the animals is a difficult and invasive procedure, our second aim is to develop a rapid, noninvasive screen for the virus. Some flaviviruses are shed in the feces of primates, therefore we will analyze fecal samples from primates that have ZIKV-positive blood cultures or serology to determine whether the virus is present. Urine, which has been used to detect ZIKV, will be an alternative method. We will modify the protocol to optimize ZIKV detection from this non-invasive sampling method. The results of this study will provide critical information on the role of Neotropical primates in the spread of Zika in the Americas."
"9565729","Project title: Pathogenic Role of EPAC1 Signaling in Retinopathy of Prematurity SUMMARY Retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) is the leading cause of vision impair and blindness in the USA in the childhood. Laser photocoagulation is the standard-of-care for treating retinal neovascularization (NV) in ROP, and supplement cryotherapy is occasionally used in severe cases. These treatments only target pathological neovascularization (NV) and have many limitations. There is great need for new strategies and therapies to target other aspects of the disease, including retinal neuronal injury, and promote vascular repair in addition to the control of NV. This study is to determine the role of Epac1 in neuronal injury, pathological NV and physiological vascular repair, and determine the therapeutic effect of Epac inhibitors. Our central hypothesis is that Epac1 activation plays a key causal role in retinal neuronal injury, impairing vascular repair and promoting retinal pathological neovascularization during oxygen-induced retinopathy. This application will, for the first time, use Epac1 global KO mice, Epac1 conditional KO mice and novel Epac inhibitor to investigate the cAMP/Epac1 pathway in retinal neuronal injury, NV and vascular repair. It will address specific contributions of neuronal vs. endothelial Epac1 in these processes, and investigate potential mechanisms of Epac1-induced retinal neuronal and vascular alternations. The research is expected to significantly advance the mechanistic understanding of retinal neurovascular pathologic changes and should facilitate the development of novel strategies to prevent NV, protect retinal neurons and improves vascular repair in ROP."
"9446409","Abstract for: Exploring How Spokespersons Understand and Experience Surrogate Decision Making The importance of advance care planning is widely appreciated. What we have learned from our current study (#5R01NR012757), however, is that ACP interventions demonstrated to be effective with patients and clinicians do not work as well for spokespersons of patients with serious, advanced illness, and in particular do not appear to decrease spokesperson distress from surrogate decision-making. We also discovered that spokespersons often conceive of surrogate decision-making differently than clinicians/researchers. This new discovery is important because to evaluate whether ACP helps ensure a patient's wishes are respected, or prepares a spokesperson to represent a patient, or decreases decisional distress, we must first be able to accurately identify whether and when a surrogate decision has been made. So, if (as our data suggest) spokespersons often conceptualize and report surrogate decision-making differently than clinicians and researchers, such differences must be well understood before we can design ACP interventions that are effective for spokespersons.  This 3-year study will capitalize on a rare opportunity to study the actual experiences of a large cohort of spokespersons in the throes of surrogate decision-making. Specifically, we will continue to follow 150 spokespersons (of patients with serious, advanced illness) who are already enrolled in our parent R01grant. Using a convergent mixed- methods study design we will: 1) interview spokespersons soon after they have made (or report that they made) a surrogate decision and perform an ethnographic analysis; 2) measure their distress from surrogate decision-making, as well as their individual decision-making styles and personality traits using quantitative questionnaires; 3) transform qualitative themes into categories and relate them to the quantitative data (personality trait, decision styles and subjective stress) using a joint display; and 4) integrate these findings with data from the parent R01. From this, we will develop recommendations for tailoring ACP interventions to better meet emotional and other needs of spokespersons.  The proposed study takes advantage of a rare and time-sensitive opportunity to acquire highly generalizable knowledge about the ACP needs of spokespersons for patients with serious, advanced illness. Specifically, the spokespersons are already enrolled in the parent R01 study (with an attrition rate of just 6% between study visits); the expected surrogate decisions that will occur during the study period will generate extensive qualitative data that can be integrated with both new and existing data; and the mixed-methods approach will reveal new insights that would not be gained by examining the qualitative and quantitative findings independently. The study will also identify psychological factors that are associated with better outcomes (notably, less distress), which will allow our interdisciplinary team to generate recommendations for tailoring ACP interventions that address emotional needs of spokespersons. Taken together, the proposed study has the potential to greatly improve the efficacy of ACP by helping researchers and clinicians create and implement tailored ACP interventions that are better aligned with the needs of spokespersons ?who are called upon to represent severely ill patients and make life-or-death medical decisions when the patients cannot."

"9301797","The visual pigment rhodopsin is both a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) and a critical structural component of the outer segment of photoreceptor cells. Mutations in rhodopsin are the most common cause of autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa (RP), a blinding disease that afflicts more than 1.5 million individuals world- wide. Rhodopsin can activate the visual signaling cascade as a monomer, but it self-associates to form dimers and higher order multimers that have been proposed to be important for phototransduction. We discovered that certain rhodopsin mutants that cause RP through unknown mechanisms appear to be function normally as visual pigments but unlike wild type rhodopsin, they fail to dimerize when reconstituted into lipid vesicles. We hypothesize that the lack of dimerization in these mutants prevents normal photoreceptor function, leading eventually to loss of photoreceptor cells, retinal degeneration and RP pathology. The overall goal of this application is to elucidate the biological and pathobiological aspects of photoreceptor functions that rely on rhodopsin dimerization. The RP mutants we propose to analyze provide novel tools and an exciting new opportunity to study the molecular basis of rhodopsin dimerization and the specific role of dimerization in phototransduction and maintaining disc architecture. In our two specific aims, we propose to conduct a comprehensive analysis of rhodopsin dimerization from its molecular basis (and why it fails in RP mutants) to its biological role in living photoreceptors. In the first aim we will use multiscale computational approaches, combined with experimental probing and verification, to test specific hypotheses about the driving forces for rhodopsin dimerization, why dimerization is perturbed in the RP-associated rhodopsin mutants, whether heterodimerization between mutant and wildtype protein occurs and whether we can identify compensatory mutations that restore dimerization. In iterative fashion, predictions from analyses in silico will be tested in direct biochemical assays and the results will serve to refine models and computational investigations. In the second aim we will comprehensively characterize two mouse strains that homozygously express non-dimerizing rhodopsin mutants, one each corresponding to point mutations in TM1 (F45L) and TM5 (F220C) to reflect the different dimer interfaces that are directly implicated. Our goal is to conduct a ?360 degree? analysis of the heterozygous and homozygous knock-in mouse phenotypes by examining photoreceptor morphology, analyzing intracellular targeting of outer segment- resident proteins, biochemical characterization of phototransduction, and electrophysiological assessment of light responses produced by the mutant rods."
"9348928","Project Summary Efforts to integrate contact network data with molecular surveillance data provide enormous promise for HIV tracking and intervention. However, the lack of tools to facilitate integrated molecular-social surveillance remains a substantial barrier to progress. For example, most contact network data only contains information on the immediate sexual and drug use partners of a single individual. Yet, the same partners can appear across the contact networks of multiple individuals. Therefore, partners must be matched across contact networks - a process called entity resolution (ER) - in order to provide an accurate view of the overall contact network structure. The process of ER currently requires either substantial resources to manually match individuals or considerable technological expertise in programming to more efficiently match individuals using probabilistic models. Accordingly, this project will 1) develop a machine learning algorithm to match individuals across personal contact networks and validate it using a large existing dataset of young men who have sex with men, and 2) create a graphical user interface to implement the algorithm as an add-on package to an existing tool for network data capture and processing (Network Canvas). The results of this project will provide an open- source and freely available tool that can drastically reduce barriers to matching individuals across contact networks, thereby providing researchers and public health officials with unencumbered access to the underlying structure of drug use and sexual networks, and a potent tool for integrating contact network data with molecular surveillance."

"9278043","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Project 4 ? Assessing the Overuse and Underuse of Diagnostic Testing Low-value health care ? care that provides little health benefit in light of its costs and risks to patients ? is a central concern for policy-makers. Diagnostic testing is a particularly important example: while the use of high- cost diagnostic tests has skyrocketed, for many the frequency with which the tests that are performed identify new diagnoses or trigger effective interventions appears low, while some patients with likely high benefit go untested. The challenge is to make an accurate prospective prediction of each patient?s likely benefit at the time the testing decision is made. To this end, we draw on recent advances in machine learning algorithms to predict which Medicare patients are likely to benefit from specific diagnostic tests: stress testing for myocardial infarction; CT pulmonary angiography for pulmonary embolism; and spine MRI to detect treatable causes of back pain. These tests seek to detect treatable medical conditions with important health implications, but involve substantial costs, and often risks to patients. Building on early evidence that machine learning algorithms combined with massive datasets can make highly accurate predictions, we will predict test value using data available to the doctor at the time the test is ordered. We can then assess the extent to which doctors are (a) testing patients with predictably low benefit, or (b) failing to test patients with predictably high benefit. We can also use this approach to better understand whether well-documented variations in testing across regions and providers are the result of provider behavior or underlying patient factors. We will then leverage this approach using electronic health record data. This will also allow us to assess the feasibility of translating our work into a decision support intervention that could be integrated into individual hospitals? electronic health record systems. With advances in medical technology and data science, there are new opportunities to better deploy health care resources to meet the health care needs of an aging population. By developing broadly applicable machine learning techniques for estimating risk in both Medicare claims and electronic health record data, this project will generate the tools and insights needed to help ensure that health care resources are devoted to patients likely to benefit the most from them."
"9466486","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT STEM Familia: A language acquisition mobile app to improve long-term educational and health outcomes among Latino families. Enhancing the STEM (science, technology, engineering, and math) proficiency of Hispanic elementary students to prepare them for success in secondary-school and college STEM courses, and in STEM fields after graduation. While STEM fields account for most U.S. economic growth, Latino students are not likely to enroll or complete degrees in undergraduate and graduate STEM programs. Given well-established research linking grade completion, economic success, and overall health and well-being, this trend portends serious, negative, long-term physical and mental health outcomes for Latinos. Access to higher education generally, and to enrollment in STEM programs in particular, is hindered by lagging academic literacy and especially by unfamiliarity with abstract words that make up the scientific academic vocabulary (SAV). Words such as conclusion, evidence, method, integrate, relevant, distinct, and component are fundamental to STEM content-area learning, but are uncommon in everyday conversation, particularly in low-SES homes where English is not the first language. To promote Latino students? SAV proficiency, we propose a technology-based approach to acquiring and practicing SAV in family settings. We will build mobile technology that schools can share with upper elementary students and their families to increase students? exposure to evidence-based SAV instruction. STEM Familia, a Spanish-English app for mobile phones and tablets, will enable schools to overcome language and access barriers that impede families? engagement in academic support. Latino families are regular users of mobile phones. This technology can be used to deploy rich media strategies, including (1) motion-graphic illustration and definition of target words, (2) touch-screen games that stimulate vocabulary recognition and recall, and (3) brief video vignettes that model the use of target words in culturally appropriate family contexts. STEM Familia will also enable schools to leverage classroom instructional time by enabling content- area and ELD teachers to provide synchronous practice opportunities and feedback on the target vocabulary. Phase I will establish proof of concept by testing a STEM Familia prototype. This will involve the participation of 127 participants in focus groups, usability testing, and program evaluation. The latter will involve a pilot study by 44 dyads of Latino 4th/5th grade students and one of their parents. In Phase II we will build the full program and subject it to a randomized controlled study with a large and adequately powered sample of students and their families."
"9387004","Project Summary ? Overall Recent viral outbreaks in West Africa, specifically the 2013-16 Ebola Virus Outbreak, shed light on the many limitations of current surveillance and diagnostics in the region's public health systems. Tools for rapid, accurate diagnostics and genomic analysis of patient samples were often not readily available in the areas that were most severely affected by the disease, making it more difficult to reduce morbidity and mortality during the epidemic. There is a need for Africans to get more engaged in locally using the wide array of genomic techniques and data in order to improve patient treatment. . This proposal aims to characterize and survey microbial threats across West Africa, such as Ebola, Lassa fever, and malaria, by building on a long-term collaborative effort among established academic, research and clinical centers in Nigeria (RUN, ISTH), Senegal (UCAD), and Sierra Leone (KGH), along with additional partners in the US at the Broad Institute and Tulane University. The proposed collaborative center will (1) utilize next generation sequencing and microbial metagenomics technologies to identify and characterize the nature and extent of circulating viral pathogens at the study sites; (2) develop robust and cost-effective field diagnostics, using both molecular and immunoassays to swiftly and accurately capture the prevalence of these pathogens in the population, and (3) use this genomic and immunological data, along with studies on the clinical manifestations of these diseases, to characterize the pathogen-host interaction and enhance clinical care. In addition the proposed project will substantially increase the building capacity for African scientists in the field of genomics, both by improving the technical resources at the project sites and through intensive training in genomics and bioinformatics at both the African and US sites. Specifically, using Illumina MiSeq instruments currently on site in Nigeria and Senegal (and coming soon to Sierra Leone), we will further expand capacity for next generation sequencing and computational analysis.. These activities serve our overall strategic goals of moving more research operations to African sites and empowering African scientists to perform cutting-edge genomic infectious disease research and discovery fully within the continent."
"9352291","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  In neonatal intensive care using clinical decision support, the focus of this career development proposal is to improve application of evidence-based practices for prevention and early recognition of necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) among premature infants. NEC is a catastrophic complication threatening the life of fragile premature infants, yet adoption of prevention and early recognition practices (e.g. preferential use of human milk; adoption of standardized feeding protocols; transfusion and antibiotics management) differ widely as do NEC rates. Parents play a key role in NEC prevention (e.g. providing mother's own milk), but heretofore, have been insufficiently engaged as partners. Accounting for 20% of US NICU costs, NEC develops late in the hospital postnatal course and can strike suddenly but until now, no tools to guide early NEC recognition were available. To address this need, a NEC risk decision rule, called GutCheckNEC was derived and validated by our team to accurately discriminate NEC. Integration of prevention practices into clinical workflow using clinical decision support (CDS) has been shown to improve adherence to recommended care across settings. Yet, both the use and evaluation of CDS in NICUs are sparse, and we know of no studies related to CDS support for prevention of NEC. Informed by the Translating Research Into Practice (TRIP) framework for implementation science, in two NICUs using an interrupted time series design, we will integrate NEC-Zero into CDS to fit clinician workflow, optimize usability, and test effects on NEC disease, neonate nutrition and parental satisfaction. The central hypothesis is that adherence to guideline-recommended NEC prevention and early recognition practices (called NEC-Zero and evaluated using an adherence score) will improve when delivered using CDS and NEC disease will decline. First, clinician workflow will be described using workflow maps constructed from interviews with local clinicians and the NEC-Zero integrated into CDS in the form of standard order sets, alerts, reminders and trend data (Aim 1). Then, using a simulated NEC scenario and iterative evaluation, NEC-Zero usability will be optimized (Aim 2). Finally, with an interrupted time series analysis from indicators in the 1 year prior to and 1 year after NEC-Zero implementation, we will compare the trend for NEC disease, neonate nutrition, and parent satisfaction outcomes; then describe the relationship between post-NEC-Zero clinician CDS outcomes (adherence scores, use response rates, satisfaction, perception of unintended consequences of CDS) and NEC disease outcomes (Aim 3). Formal training in usable clinical decision support under the mentorship of Daniel Malone, PhD, RPh & co-mentor Robert Greenes, MD, PhD will complement training in theories and methodologies of Implementation Science mentored by Drs. Marita Titler and Melanie Bell. Over time we will be able to apply the automation and testing of CDS for multi-faceted interventions to other clinical challenges in NICUs to achieve the goal for this program of research, which is to reduce morbidity and mortality from neonatal complications and limit costs."
"9456125","Chromatic two-photon fluorescence microscopy using band-shifting imaging probes Two-photon fluorescence microscopy has emerged as one of the most important imaging modalities for biological research and medical diagnosis. Although many techniques exist for realizing high speed two-photon imaging in the lateral directions, the axial imaging speed is still often limited by the slow mechanical scanning of the objective lens or the specimen, presenting a significant challenge for monitoring fast biological processes at multiple depths as well as in 3D and the development of miniature endoscopy. To overcome this limitation, here a new spectrally encoded two-photon imaging technique is proposed using band-shifting imaging probes, which can enable parallel axial imaging. Specifically, different excitation wavelengths are focused onto different axial positions (through purposely introduced chromatic aberration) to excite two-photon fluorescence from the band-shifting imaging probes, which shift the emission band when the excitation wavelength varies. As such, the fluorescence signals at different axial positions are spectrally encoded to exhibit different spectral bands, and can thus be imaged in parallel by using a spectrometer or arrayed wavelength-resolving detectors. The proposed band-shifting imaging probes will be synthesized, optimized, and used for cellular labeling. Systematic characterization on the molecular structures, molecular weight, photophysical and two-photon properties will be performed. The proposed chromatic two-photon imaging system will be designed, developed, and optimized. System metrics including the mapping relationship between the axial position and fluorescence band shift, the axial imaging range, and spatial resolutions will be characterized. The proposed method will be demonstrated and validated by performing imaging of cells and tissue phantoms as well as by in vivo imaging studies of a colorectal cancer xenograft model."
"9350783","Project Summary/Abstract Mammalian cell biology is dynamic and responsive. Advances in genomic technology over the last decade made rich (eg multiplexed; genome-wide in the extreme) datasets accessible to individual biomedical investigators on a routine basis. But today's `omic approaches require destruction of cells to access their molecular contents and cannot resolve cellular diversity in situ. Researchers need tools that can probe living biology in tissue to produce rich time-series data specific to cells of interest that illuminate dynamic phenomena. The lack of such tools remains a major limitation in biological and biomedical research today. Here I propose a technology that allows cells to self-report their internal states in time series measurements by secreting a portion of their contents, which can be collected from the culture media for analysis by RNA-Seq and other methods without harming the cells. This capability will enable analysis of dynamic biological processes in heterogeneous cell populations, including tissues, where we can engineer the export apparatus to be selectively activated in the cells of interest. Obtaining time series data to follow dynamic processes simplifies experiments by eliminating the requirement that separate samples be prepared for each time point, enabling samples to serve as their own controls."
"9446084","PROJECT SUMMARY There is ever-growing evidence that African Americans (AAs) with multiple sclerosis (MS) present with a more severe disease course than Caucasian-Americans (CAs) with MS. It has been reported that clinical disability outcomes are worse, and inflammatory and MRI biomarkers significantly more unfavourable in AAs MS patients than in their CAs counterparts. Although genetic and environmental risk factors are likely to play a role, it is unclear why AAs MS patients experience a more disabling effect of the disease even after controlling for education, income, and insurance status. Two previous MRI studies have suggested that the more severe course is associated with the higher white matter (WM) lesion accumulation rather than with greater whole brain atrophy. However, these studies were limited by the retrospective or cross-sectional design and by the lack of assessment of regional cortical and sub-cortical gray matter (GM) volume. Moreover, potential differences in brain GM cortical lesion (CL) count and in area/volume of the spinal cord (SC) between MS patients of AA and CA ancestry have not been investigated up to date. Brain GM atrophy and CLs as well as SC atrophy occur since the early stages of MS and are independent predictors of physical disability and cognitive impairment suggesting their prominent role in determining the extent and pace of disease progression. Therefore, we propose a prospective, longitudinal brain and cervical SC MRI study of MS patients of AA and CA ancestry focused on the assessment of atrophy of strategic anatomical regions such as the thalamus and SC, on the assessment of diffuse microscopic WM tissue damage in the corpus callosum and SC and the assessment of cortical GM focal inflammation. We will also investigate the relationship between brain and SC MRI metrics and neurological and cognitive impairment at baseline and follow-up. This research is innovative because it proposes the first prospective clinical and MRI study of AAs MS patients with a longitudinal design to investigate the pathophysiology of the disease in MS patients of AA ancestry and to identify short- and medium-term predictors of disease and disability progression. The proposed research is significant because it will advance our understanding of the pathophysiology of neurodegeneration in MS and will provide accurate tools to better (i) understand the mechanisms leading to worse physical and cognitive disability in AAs MS patients; (ii) identify predictors of more aggressive disease progression in MS patients of AA descent, and (iii) help tailor therapeutic development and clinical interventions based on this knowledge."
"9470704","Project Summary Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a heritable neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by heterogeneous genetic etiology and behavioral symptomatology. While recent genetics research suggests that the cumulative effects of many single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on many genes confer increased risk of ASD, very little is known about how additive genetic risk impacts brain function and structure. My dissertation work leverages variation at the genetic, neural, and behavioral levels by investigating how cumulative genetic risk for ASD on a gene implicated in social behavior across species ? the oxytocin receptor gene (OXTR) ? impacts network-level activity and connectivity in brain regions critical for social reward processing, and how risk-allele dosage relates to individual differences in ASD symptomatology. Results of my first dissertation study have shown that OXTR risk-allele dosage modulates resting-state connectivity of the reward network in both youth with ASD and typically developing (TD) youth, although in different ways. In youth with ASD, greater OXTR risk is associated with reduced connectivity between nodes of the reward circuit and greater symptom severity. Conversely, in TD youth, greater OXTR risk-allele dosage is associated with greater connectivity between the reward network and frontal brain regions involved in mentalizing and this, in turn, is associated with better social functioning (Hernandez et al., 2016a). These findings in TD youth suggest a compensatory neural mechanism in the face of increased genetic risk for ASD, and raise further questions about the role of other genetic (i.e., epistatic) and environmental/experiential variables in steering development along typical vs. atypical trajectories. My ongoing dissertation study examines the moderating effects of diagnosis and gender on the relationship between OXTR risk-allele dosage and neural processing of social rewards using functional neuroimaging (fMRI). While I have gained strong expertise in connectivity-based neuroimaging, genetics, and the neurobiology of ASD, my last dissertation project will provide additional training in analysis of task-related fMRI data and assessment of changes in task-based functional connectivity (i.e., training in psychophysiological interaction analyses). My dissertation work thus far highlights how little is known about the mechanisms by which individuals with the same genetic risk for mental illness have different outcomes (i.e., affected vs. resilient). As a post-doctoral researcher, I aim to gain additional training in the assessment of environmental and experiential variables that affect neurodevelopmental outcomes, as well as in advanced data-analytic approaches to model multilevel interactions between gene-brain-environment measures (e.g., statistical analysis of longitudinal data, machine learning algorithms, imaging-genetics of genome-wide data) with the ultimate goal of combining these data to better predict risk for mental illness and inform interventions. These aims are in line with the NIH Blueprint for NIMH, NICHD, and NINDS, as they seek to elucidate the neurobiological mechanisms underlying complex human behavior and neurodevelopmental disorders."
"9395786","Abstract The overarching goal of this study is to understand how BEST1 expression is modulated by cis-regulatory elements in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). The variability of retinal phenotypes and age of onset of visual loss, even in individuals who carry the same causative mutation, is one of the biggest mysteries for BEST1 related diseases. Genetic variations in non-coding regulatory elements can serve as an attractive model to provide the molecular basis for the observed various onsets of BEST1 vitelliform macular dystrophy (BVMD) in patients. Therefore understanding the transcriptional control mediated by cis-regulatory elements in the RPE will give us insight into novel target regions for therapeutic editing of the enhancer elements identified by this study. We are utilizing human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs)-derived RPEs as a model to understand cell type-specific transcriptional controls of BEST1. We are also utilizing integrative, unbiased, and high throughput epigenomic and genetic tools to achieve the following aims: (1) We will use a high resolution 4C-seq analysis to identify potential regulatory elements that interact with the BEST1 promoter in human primary RPE. (2) In Aim 2, we will generate BEST1 dual allele reporter lines and use these lines to interrogate cis-regulatory elements of BEST1 in their native chromatin contexts utilizing high throughput CRIPSR/Cas9 mediated genome editing approach. (3) Finally, we will test the utilities of allelic specific enhancer deletion to modulate allelic expression of BEST1. We expect these analyses will significantly advance our knowledge of the precise control of BEST1 transcription in RPEs."
"9453858","PROJECT SUMMARY  The ability to perform a sequence of movements is a key component of motor skills (e.g., typing, playing a musical instrument, etc.). The preparation for and generation of sequential movements is generally thought to depend on premotor areas in the frontal lobe such as the supplementary motor area (SMA) and the pre-SMA (Roland et al., 1980; Tanji and Shima, '94; Gerloff et al., '97; Shima and Tanji, '98; Nakamura et al., '98; Picard and Strick, '01; Hikosaka et al., '02). According to this view, the primary motor cortex (M1) is thought to produce the patterns of muscle activity that are necessary to implement the plans generated by the premotor areas. There is growing evidence, however, that M1 is involved in both the acquisition and the retention of sequential movements (Matsuzaka et al., '07; Dayan and Cohen, '11; Picard et al., '13; see also Preliminary Results). These results have led us to propose that M1 is a site of storage for skilled movements. This application is designed to explore and test this hypothesis.  A lesion of M1 will abolish the motor commands to the spinal cord that generate specific patterns of muscle activity. Instead, we propose to manipulate the protein synthesis and the regulation of gene expression in M1 of monkeys to selectively disrupt information storage in this cortical area. This approach has been successful in the experimental dissection and analysis of other memory systems in rodents (e.g., Nader et.al., `00; Kleim et al., '03; Miller et al., '10; Jarome et.al., `14). We will examine whether this manipulation in M1 of non-human primate disrupts the performance of sequential movements guided from memory without affecting the performance of movements guided by vision. We will train monkeys on two sequence tasks (Matsuzaka et al., `07). In one task, sequential movements are instructed by visual cues, whereas in the other task movements are internally generated from memory. After an animal becomes skilled in these tasks, we will inject inhibitors for protein synthesis and DNA methylation into M1 and test the monkey's performance of the tasks. In our preliminary experiments, injection of a protein synthesis inhibitor (anisomycin) into M1 successfully disrupted the performance of sequential movements guided from memory but did not have a significant effect on the performance of visually guided reaching, neural activity during visually guided reaching or hand trajectory of correct trials. On the other hand, inactivation of M1 using muscimol disrupted the performance of both tasks. We will acquire data using anisomycin from additional animals and data using other pharmacological agents (e.g. cycloheximide and inhibitor of DNA methylation) to explore and test our hypotheses. The proposed studies will provide some novel information on the cortical mechanisms that underlie a critical aspect of human behavior? the retention of motor skills."
"9558592","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This P41 Biotechnology Resource Grant application seeks renewed support for our successful efforts to develop and apply innovative neuroimaging technologies within the highly integrated multimodal framework of the Center for Functional Neuroimaging Technologies (CFNT). The overall goal of this established NIBIB Biomedical Technology Resource Center (BTRC) is to provide advanced technology resources to more closely examine, and thus better understand, the human brain in health and disease. To this end, we seek to develop new techniques and advance existing technologies to acquire and analyze functional images of the working brain, with unprecedented physiological precision and spatiotemporal resolution, and to deploy these innovative tools to promote investigation of complex neuroscientific questions. Through coordinated research and development, collaborative research, service use, training and dissemination activities, our BTRC has built a standard of excellence in developing, sharing, and supporting the use of multimodal imaging tools that have consistently advanced capabilities for research that spans many basic science and clinical domains. Central to this effort are our four Technology Research and Development (TRD) projects to improve and extend techniques for non-invasive magnetic resonance image analysis (Project 1) and acquisition (Project 2), electromagnetic source imaging (Project 3), and optical neuroimaging (Project 4). Directly motivating the Aims of these TRD projects is a strong network of Collaborative Projects, which both challenge the TRDs to continue to innovate the next-generation neuroimaging tools, and reciprocally, employ the new tools we develop to drive their own research forward in new directions. Another essential element in this framework is the extensive application of our resources by a wide and diverse Service Users community. Finally, the TRDs, Collaborative and Service Projects contribute to the BTRC's Training and Dissemination mission, which additionally includes multiple dedicated Fellowships and Workshops, strong web presense, and important industrial partnerships, providing multiple channels to share the knowledge needed to apply the tools we develop with the scientific community locally, nationally, and internationally."
"9432386","SUMMARY  The overall goal of this project is to develop novel and efficient statistical methods for simultaneous inference of group- and subject-level functional connectivity networks among adolescents with high suicidal risk. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has been extensively used to detect neural activities, which involves integrated networks consisting of multiple brain regions. To understand how normal brains work and how diseases disrupt normal functioning, it's essential to figure out how different parts of brain are coordinated, in so-called ?functional connectivity networks?. In particular, this proposal seeks to investigate the functional connectivity pattern among adolescents suffering from depression from a real-time fMRI dataset recently collected at the University of Minnesota. Current studies of functional connectivity networks primarily focus on the single subject analyses, which suffers from issues regarding the reliability of fMRI readings, does not borrow strength from fMRI data of other subjects who share the same clinical characteristics, and fails to provide group-level information that might shed light on diagnostic or treatment strategies for patients with a certain disease. Other studies make group-level inference of functional connectivity network by assuming a common network structure shared by all patients in the group, ignoring the differences between subjects and variabilities between fMRI sessions.  In this application, we propose to develop novel and efficient statistical methods that can simultaneously learn the group- and subject-level network structures of functional connectivity from mutli- subject fMRI data. In Specific Aim 1, we will develop a novel and efficient method, the random covariance model, for simultaneous inference of group- and subject-level functional connectivity networks. In Specific Aim 2, we will extend the random covariance model to a Bayesian model that incorporates a mean structure with fixed and random effects and is expected to be robust to outliers having disparate network structures. Both methods will be evaluated using extensive simulation studies and be applied to an existing fMRI dataset collected recently at the University of Minnesota from depressed adolescents with a group of healthy controls.  Our proposed methods will account for the similarity between subjects having the same clinic characteristics in their interregional neural interactions, identify the group-level functional connectivity network that is shared by all subjects in the tested group, and at the same time infer multiple subject-level functional connectivity networks by allowing for differences between subjects. The method achieves group- and subject- level network inference simultaneously by utilizing a penalization term on the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between the subject- and group-level covariance matrices, which makes it computationally efficient for multi- subject fMRI data analysis. More advantageously, the model can be looked at as a random covariance model that mimics the random effect model for mean structures in a linear regression."
"9366710","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Our goal is to define how lymphatic molecules control AQH drainage and intraocular pressure (IOP) elevation. IOP elevation is a major risk factor for glaucoma, a disease that will affect 80 million people by the end of the decade. Glaucoma therapy is based on reducing elevated IOP but no current drug is able to reduce IOP very effectively indicating the pressing need for improved therapies. IOP elevation results from resistance to aqueous humor (AQH) drainage, which occurs in the vicinity of the inner wall endothelium of Schlemm's canal (SC). However, the molecular mechanisms functioning in the SC inner wall cells, and in generating resistance to AQH drainage, are not well defined. The SC of mice and humans are very similar anatomically and with respect to AQH outflow physiology; thus the mouse is a powerful model for studying SC function. Using the mouse, we showed that SC is a unique vessel with both blood endothelial and lymphatic endothelial features. A key feature of SC is expression of the lymphatic master regulator transcription factor Prox1, which is required for lymphatic development and maintenance. Based on our previous study showing that PROX1 is enriched in SC inner wall cells and is likely important for functional specialization of these cells, and on known functions of PROX1 in lymphatic tissues, Prox1 is a strong candidate for our functional studies. In this project we will determine the role of Prox1 in controlling AQH drainage. We will accomplish this in three aims. Aim 1) To determine if Prox1 haploinsufficiency disrupts AQH outflow and raises IOP. In preliminary studies using mice we show that Prox1 heterozgosity in the SC elevates IOP. We will use this tool in Aim 1 to define for the first time the role of Prox1 in regulating AQH drainage and IOP. Aim 2) Determine the effect of Prox1 knockout on SC development and function. To accomplish this, Prox1 will be deleted conditionally in mice at critical stages of SC development. These experiments will allow identification of potentially new morphogenetic functions for Prox1 in the developing SC and comprehensive determination of PROX1 function in the adult SC. Aim 3) Identify Prox1-regulated pathways in SC that control AQH outflow or IOP. Prox1-regulated genes in the SC inner wall are candidates for controlling AQH outflow. To identify candidate genes we will use RNAseq and differential expression analysis as well as targeted proteomics to define Prox1 haploinsufficiency-induced changes in SC that cause IOP elevation. Using these data, candidate pathways and hub genes important for AQH outflow will be identified. Importantly, our project will use innovative new approaches that we developed for high-resolution examination of the mouse SC using the Prox1-GFP mouse and other fluorescent genetic reporters and accurate measurement of AQH outflow in the mouse. Successful completion of these aims will yield critical new information on the mechanisms regulating IOP, and will lay the groundwork for identification of more effective therapeutic targets for glaucoma.  "
"9382004","Project Summary Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), which accounts for approximately 85% of all renal cancers, is resistant to a variety of cancer therapies and is highly lethal. A hallmark of ccRCC is the inactivation of the von Hippel Lindau (VHL) tumor suppressor gene, which is inactivated either by mutation or hypermethylation in up to 90% of ccRCC. While pVHL functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase adaptor protein that promotes the degradation of hypoxia inducible (HIF?) transcription factors, other key pVHL substrates are only now emerging and their functional roles in renal cancer remains undefined. Here we identify a zinc-finger/homeodomain protein ZHX2 as a potential novel pVHL substrate by using a newly developed genome-wide in vitro expression strategy coupled with GST-binding screening. Our preliminary data suggests that pVHL interacts with and degrades ZHX2 in a hydroxylase activity-dependent manner, similar to regulation of the HIF? proteins. Functionally, knockdown of ZHX2 blocks cell proliferation, soft agar growth and xenograft tumor growth of pVHL-deficient renal cancer cells. Importantly, ZHX2 expression levels are strongly elevated in ccRCC tumors compared to normal patients. Mechanistically, ZHX2 interacts with the RelA/p65 subunit of NF-kB and positively regulates pVHL-loss induced RelA/p65 nuclear localization. Integrated analyses of ChIP-Seq and microarray also reveal that ZHX2 regulates both NF-kB-dependent and independent pathways in ccRCC. Therefore, we hypothesize that ZHX2 promotes renal oncogenesis through both NF-kB dependent and independent pathways following VHL inactivation. This is the first study directed at a pro-oncogenic function for ZHX2, with the focus on its key role downstream of the loss of pVHL in renal cancer. In Specific Aim 1, we will study the mechanism by which ZHX2 is regulated by pVHL in a hydroxylation-dependent manner. In Specific Aim 2, we will determine the functional significance of deregulated ZHX2 in pVHL-deficient renal cancer. In Specific Aim 3, we will determine the mechanisms by which ZHX2 regulates NF-kB-dependent and -independent signaling and renal tumorigenesis upon pVHL loss. Successful completion of this proposal would provide significant new molecular insight into oncogenic mechanisms associated with the great majority of ccRCC as well as the potential for new therapies for this typically lethal disease."
"9571423","PROJECT SUMMARY White matter pathway deficits are common in neurodevelopmental disorders, including Angelman syndrome (AS). The few imaging studies performed to date suggest that AS individuals have generalized white matter deficits, including loss of volume and possibly delayed myelination. However, white matter deficits in AS remain poorly defined, making it difficult to link them to behavioral phenotypes and, consequently, to establish their value as therapeutic biomarkers. Accordingly, a major unmet need is to elucidate the anatomical and pathophysiological basis for white matter deficits in AS, and to test whether prevention or reversal of these deficits leads to improvement in core behavioral domains. Preliminary data from children with AS show reductions in white matter volume and integrity of white matter fiber tracts, as well as strong relationships between these WM deficits and motor delays. Our preliminary data in AS model mice demonstrate that they exhibit white matter pathway impairments that recapitulate those found in AS individuals. The white matter deficits in the AS model mice are quantifiable at all levels of analysis, from macroscopic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) coupled with diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to ultrastructural electron microscopy (EM). Here we will leverage the experimental tractability of AS model mice and our unique access to AS individuals through the UNC Angelman Syndrome Clinic (the first AS clinic established in the United States) to reveal the precise anatomical and pathophysiological underpinnings of white matter deficits in AS. Our research constitutes a novel effort to directly link white matter deficits in a human neurodevelopmental disorder with its mouse model, and will test our data-driven central hypothesis that white matter pathway impairments and associated AS phenotypes arise from delayed myelination and a loss of large-diameter axons that can be prevented by reinstatement of UBE3A expression in neurons. To achieve our goals, we aim to (1) Delineate white matter pathway deficits and test the hypothesis that they are a biomarker for motor phenotypes in children with AS, (2) Define the developmental trajectory and underlying anatomical basis for white matter deficits in AS model mice, and (3) Model the efficacy of early versus late therapeutic intervention toward the normalization of white matter deficits and motor outcomes in AS. Through our research, we seek to inform treatment strategies for AS and to establish WM integrity as a novel endpoint for upcoming AS clinical trials."
"9446435","PROJECT SUMMARY  We and others have shown that a subset of tumor cells capable of regenerating new tumors, termed variously  as tumor-initiating cells (TIC) or ?cancer stem cells? (CSC), are comparatively resistant to current systemic  chemo- and radio-therapies relative to the bulk of the tumor. As such, the guiding premise for our work over the  past decade, is that therapeutic targeting of processes required for survival or function of TIC will allow  elimination of such cells at both the primary and metastatic sites, thereby enhancing response to current  systemic therapies. However, it has become clear from several laboratories using current cell surface markers,  enzymatic activity markers, and lentiviral signaling reporters for Wnt, Hedgehog, and STAT3-mediated  signaling, that TIC are heterogeneous not only across tumors, but also show different behaviors, treatment  responses, and reporter gene expression at the primary and metastatic sites within a given tumor model. Thus,  it is critical to understand the diversity of TIC types both within and across tumors, as well as to understand  how such cells differ in function between the primary and metastatic site, in order to target them effectively ?  particularly in ?triple-negative? breast cancer (TNBC), for which there are no approved targeted therapies.  We hypothesize that there exist molecularly distinct classes of TIC in TNBC. As a consequence, differential  responses to individual chemotherapies depend, in part, on the class(es) of TIC present in a given tumor. If  true, we further assert that identifying and targeting class-specific TIC functions may help overcome  chemotherapy resistance.  In order to identify candidate regulatory genes or pathways functioning in a spectrum of PDX-derived TIC  isolated from primary and metastatic sites, we propose to determine first whether TIC derived from either the  primary or metastatic site show identical, or different, patterns of activation of signaling networks implicated in  TIC function using lentiviral fluorescent reporters specific for signaling pathways and transcription factors  implicated in TIC function. We will then identify candidate molecular mechanisms required for TIC activity at  the population and single cell levels using RNAseq.  In order to determine whether in vivo targeting of TIC-related genes/pathways can augment response to  carboplatin, and lead to elimination of different classes of TIC at both the primary and metastatic sites, we will  evaluate the ability of FDA-approved agents targeting TIC to augment treatment response alone or in  combination with carboplatin at the primary and metastatic sites, and assay the effect of treatment on TIC  function in vivo. Results may be used to guide planning and execution of human clinical trials and inform  precision medicine efforts."
"9434582","Abstract  About half of all MRI procedures use agents to better improve contrast between tissues and to increase signal to noise. Nearly all clinically used contrast agents contain gadolinium (as Gd(III)), a paramagnetic lanthanide ion that effectively increases the longitudinal (T1) relaxation rates of water protons to give positive contrast. Yet, currently there is increasing concern over the deposition of Gd(III) ion in skin, bone and brain tissue. This concern has led to interest in alternatives to Gd(III) agents. One alternative is to develop trivalent iron (Fe(III)) coordination complexes as T1 agents. The research proposed here involves the development of the first Fe(III) macrocyclic complexes as MRI contrast agents. The proposed complexes have many advantages over previously reported complexes. For example, the Fe(III) oxidation state is highly stabilized by the macrocyclic ligand in order to prevent reduction to Fe(II) that would produce reactive oxygen species. In addition, ligand donor groups that form extensive hydrogen bonds are chosen to maximize outersphere water relaxivity. Specific goals include: 1) tuning the water exchange rate constant and pKa of Fe(III) water ligands to optimize T1 relaxivity, 2) derivatization of the macrocyclic complexes with benzyloxymethyl and other benzyl groups to produce Fe(III) contrast agents for hepatobiliary uptake and imaging, 3) to increase the rotational correlation time by connecting three Fe(III) complexes to a central linker for the production of even more highly effective contrast agents and 4) to study our lead complexes in mice on a 4.7 T scanner. In vivo MRI studies will monitor the bio-distribution and clearance of the contrast agent over time. Comparison will be made to commercial Gd(III) agents. We anticipate that the development of these Fe(III)T1 MRI contrast agents will open up new applications for contrast agents as well as reach additional patient populations."
"9327670","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our UCLA team in partnership with United Healthcare (UHC) proposes to form a cooperative agreement with the CDC and NIDDK to evaluate the impact of two highly innovative programs in Medicaid known as the Accountable Care Communities (ACC) Program and the Health Home (HH) Program. Both programs are delivery system transformations with on-the-ground partnerships to support improvements in care and population management strategies for Medicaid beneficiaries, many of whom have diabetes and other complex care needs. The implementation of the ACC and HH programs by one of the nation's largest for-profit insurance companies who has over 1 million new Medicaid enrollees since 2012, represents a unique and very timely evaluation of real-world interventions. The overall goal of the research is to employ rigorous empirical evaluation of the impact of these innovative programs on the delivery, outcomes, and cost of care for adult Medicaid enrollees with diabetes. Our specific aims are as follows: 1) To evaluate whether the Medicaid ACC Program which provides on-the-ground partnerships that embed  UHC transformation consultants and nurses into practices to support improvements in care, provides  access to complete health care and community wide data analytics to support population management and  includes practice level financial incentives, such as shared savings programs, will lead to improvements in  adherence to medications and diabetes processes of care, in A1c and LDL-c control, fewer emergency  room visits and hospitalizations and lower overall costs of care. 2) To evaluate whether the Medicaid HH Program which targets patients with serious chronic physical and  mental health conditions who also have high social needs, and high costs of care, and provides them  intensive, individualized care management from an integrated team inclusive of community health workers  will lead to improvement in adherence to medications and diabetes processes of care, in A1c and LDL-c  control, fewer emergency room visits and hospitalizations and lower overall costs of care. 3) To fully participate in a collaborative multi-institution netwok designed to strengthen the research methods  for evaluating natural experiments across all sites, and to advance the best analytic methods for natural  experiments in the US research community Our UCLA team will use quasi-experimental designs, de-identified data from UHC, and state-of-the-art modeling strategies to achieve these aims. Our team's 11 years of highly productive partnership with UHC, 19 years of experience evaluating policy-relevant natural experiments, most recently in the NEXT-D study, and 12 years of leading study coordination across national collaboratives, will help ensure our success."

"9440019","PROJECT SUMMARY Given the growing diversity of populations in the United States, communicating effectively is a key element of sexual health promotion to teens in communities where disparities exist, particularly among African American, Hispanic/Latino, American Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN), and sexual and gender minority (SGM) youth. Disparities in sexual health outcomes suggest that these subgroups may not be receiving sufficient health information, or that messages are not perceived as relevant or understandable, impeding healthy decision-making. Understanding common and unique aspects of values, beliefs, and language should allow the crafting of messages, strategies, and steps to improve communication and contextualize sexual health promotion messages at individual and community levels. Our research will determine the preferred messages, messengers, and communication channels relevant to teens for the specific topics of abstinence, consistent and correct use of condoms, and STI/HIV testing. In response to the requested objectives in SIP 17-006, our research aims are to: (1) Conduct a literature review of barriers, facilitators, and current STI/HIV and pregnancy prevention messages and messaging channels for adolescents by race/ethnicity, sexual orientation and gender identity; (2) Conduct focus groups/interviews with African American, Hispanic/Latino, AI/AN, and SGM youth on messages, sources, and channels; (3) Conduct a Delphi survey of experts to achieve consensus on the findings of the literature review and focus groups; and (4) Conduct a second round of focus groups with a larger and broader sample of youth, to revise and finalize specific theory- and evidence-based recommendations for sexual health messaging to that meets the diversity of the adolescent population. Combining our understanding from youth (the constituent stakeholders) with input from topical experts will ensure the development of a set of recommendations that are both practical and based on evidence for acceptability and efficacy. The ultimate product will be a library of messages and strategies (including written, printed and oral sexual health messages), as well as messages delivered via mass media and multimedia technologies, organized by middle and high school age, gender, race/ethnicity, and sexual orientation and gender identity. Our approach builds upon existing collaborations and access to diverse communities, and our extensive experience as a team in adolescent sexual health promotion. It is innovative because it not only seeks to identify effective messaging in sexual health promotion, but also cultural factors influencing effectiveness."

Significantly less is known about thes HAIs among children in ambulatory settings, including incidence rates, risk-factors, outcomes and costs. Pediatric ambulatory central line-associated blood stream infections (CLABSI) and catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTI), and surgical site infections (SSI) following ambulatory surgery, likely harm thousands of children annually, although precise epidemiologic data are unknown. Single-center studies and disease-specific studies led by this proposal's principal investigator, suggest the burden of ambulatory pediatric HAIs may be 3 times higher than inpatient pediatric HAIs. In addition, existing ambulatory HAI studies often utilize labor intensive surveillance and data collection methods, making ongoing identification of HAIs challenging and interventions to reduce these infections difficult to scale and disseminate. This grant proposes a multisite, epidemiologic investigation into 3 pediatric ambulatory HAIs using the New York City Clinical Data Research Network (NYC-CDRN). The NYC- CDRN is a comprehensive and longitudinal healthcare data repository from 5 pediatric healthcare systems in a diverse region. This proposal directly responds to the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality's (AHRQ) Funding Opportunity Announcement HS-15-002 on ambulatory patient safety, focuses on an urban population, and will benefit an AHRQ priority population: children. Utilizing both clinical and administrative electronic data, and intensive chart review methodologies, we will identify incidence rates, risk factors, patient outcomes and costs for ambulatory pediatric CLABSI and CAUTI, and SSI following ambulatory surgery. Additionally, we will develop and validate Classification and Regression Tree (CART) predictive models for HAI events and central line and urinary catheter days based only on clinical and administrative electronic data. This research will draw attention to pediatric ambulatory patient safety, reduce the ambulatory HAI surveillance and data collection burden and serve as the foundation for future projects aimed at reductions of ambulatory pediatric HAIs across multiple institutions."
"9349640","Mechanical forces and fields at the nano/microscale shape the way cells interact and respond to the environment, and are central to a broad range of physiological functions. The cellular response to  topographic and mechanical cues is fundamentally different in diseases such as metastatic cancer,  due to the resultant alterations to the cascade of biochemical signals. Exploring the  mechano-chemical coupling can not only reveal the progression profile of a disease state, but also  shed light on its mechanistic underpinnings facilitating the development of new therapeutic  regimen. Yet, gaining insights into the nanomechanical-biochemical interactions has proven to be  challenging, owing to the lack of non-invasive experimental tools with the requisite mechanical  deformation, spatial resolution and molecular sensitivity attributes. The goal of this New  Innovator proposal is to address this unmet need by developing a unified, non-invasive platform  that provides simultaneous nanometric deformation and real-time measurement of structural and  biochemical responses in live functioning cells. Leveraging a novel nanofabrication strategy, we  propose to engineer plasmonic vertical nanopillar arrays that enable mechanical loading for  adherent cells while also providing ultrasensitive, molecular-specific and highly localized  plasmon-enhanced Raman spectroscopy measurements. These salient features offer a unique portal for  label-free investigation of the biochemical milieu with sub-diffraction-limit spatial resolution  owing to the confined nature of the plasmonic field at the nanopillar tip.  We will use this label-free platform to probe latent mechano-chemical coupling events prevalent in  cell progression, and to establish biophysical and molecular markers characterizing malignant  transformation. Specifically, we plan to decode the architectural control of mechanotransduction   in ephrin A1-induced Ephrin A  receptor 2 (EPHA2) reorganization, which  represents a vital  cell  communication event with implications for cancer growth and metastasis. Furthermore, we will  dissect organ-specific differences in isogenic metastatic breast cancer cells by establishing  objective phenotypic differences and monitor cellular responses under the influence of FDA-approved  drugs. Together, this will offer fresh insights into druggable targets and inform better  therapeutic options tailored for the management and ablation of treatment-resistant metastatic  lesions. Overall, this study will not only offer a fresh, innovative approach towards understanding  cellular recognition of topographic and mechanical cues at the nanoscale but will also create the  foundation for a diagnostic and therapy response monitoring platform through quantitative,  stain-free and orthogonal cytological evaluation."
"9311514","Project Summary Visual information entering the brain is constantly changing. Its interpretation depends on the observers' goals, and on cognitive states that also change in response to current and previous input. Yet most of our knowledge of vision deals with spatial vision and spatial attention, and most existing computational models of vision and visual attention are static; they deal with stimuli that are isolated in time. This represents a critical barrier to a comprehensive theory of visual perception and attention. Temporal attention is the prioritized processing of a stimulus at a specific point in time, which can be voluntary, when a stimulus time can be anticipated, or invol- untary, when attention is triggered automatically by a stimulus. The impact of temporal attention on perception and sensory cortical responses has been little investigated, despite its indispensable role in our understanding of a constantly changing environment. We propose to fill this critical gap in the cognitive neuroscience of at- tention. Our long-term goal is to develop a spatiotemporal theory of cortical computation, widely applicable in basic and translational research in perceptual and cognitive neuroscience. Our short-term goal is to investi- gate temporal attention to understand how perception is shaped by dynamic interactions between sensory in- put and attentional modulation, and how visual cortical processing underlies those interactions. We propose an innovative theoretical framework, which makes explicit how perception and attention interact across time (Aim 1). Two alternative dynamic models, early-gain vs. late-competition, in which temporal at- tention modulates different stages of processing, will be tested and constrained with data gathered with innovative experimental protocols, combining behavioral (psychophysics; Aim 2) and neuroimaging (magne- toencephalography, MEG; Aim 3) methods. Because orientation processing is well-characterized psychophysi- cally and neurophysiologically in a static setting, we will use orientation discrimination and estimation tasks to determine the dynamic interactions between perception and attention. The empirical results will significantly advance our understanding of the time-course, perceptual consequences, resource limitations, and underlying neural mechanisms of temporal attention, and will also distinguish between alternative models and constrain model parameters. By integrating theory with behavioral and neuroimaging data, we will characterize how tem- poral attention dynamically changes perception and neural responses. The proposed research is fully in line with the NEI mission. It investigates how temporal attention modulates brain processing of visual information and how neural activity relates to visual perception. Further, because dynamic attention allocation is a central function of the visual system, the proposed research in healthy observ- ers will be readily applicable to translational research in special populations, and may advance our understand- ing of abnormalities in temporal processing and temporal attention that have been associated with personality traits, like impulsivity, and prevalent disorders such as ADHD, autism, visual neglect and dyslexia."
"9408490","PROJECT SUMMARY. The skeletal muscle wasting that occurs with cancer cachexia compromises quality of life and is both directly and indirectly responsible for cancer mortalities. Tumor-derived and tumor-responsive factors as well as many therapeutics themselves contribute to the cachectic state, although nutritional support has little if any positive effect on restoring striated muscle mass or function. Thus, novel tools for preventing muscle wasting in cancer patients could transform their treatment and significantly improve their quality of life. Our research objective is to test a novel gene therapeutic for enhancing muscle regeneration in a mouse model of tumor- and chemotherapy-induced cachexia and in addition, to complete the GLP/toxicology studies required for IND filing. We hypothesize that attenuating the intracellular signaling pathways responsible for muscle atrophy and impaired muscle regeneration will in turn restore muscle mass and function and significantly delay mortality. In fact, Phase I-equivalent data indicate that attenuating ActRIIB and Smad2/3 signaling with rAAV6:Smad7 (a.k.a. AVGN7) significantly enhances muscle mass and function in wild-type mice and can completely prevent muscle atrophy in different mouse models of cancer cachexia. Most importantly, this therapeutic does not produce the serious off-target effects that have compromised development of competing technologies that have either been shown to compromise blood vessel integrity or to possess this potential. Our specific aims are to (i) test the hypothesis that rAAV6:Smad7 can prevent cancer- and chemotherapy- induced muscle wasting, (ii) test the hypothesis that rAAV6:Smad7 reduces cancer mortality and (iii) complete murine and non-human primate toxicology studies with rAAV6:Smad7. The proposed approach is truly innovative as it utilizes a novel gene therapeutic and state-of-the art tools to comprehensively assess muscle function at different scales. These studies are also highly significant as they will provide a better mechanistic understanding of how tumor- and chemotherapy-induced muscle wasting are independently affected by ActRIIB and Smad2/3 signaling. Most importantly, these translational studies have the very real potential to impact clinical medicine and to advance clinical trials of rAAV6:Smad7."
"9405344","Neuromodulators are essential signaling molecules that regulate many neural processes, including cognition, mood, memory, and sleep, through their influence on brain circuits. Monitoring the release and distribution of neuromodulators in behaving animals is critical for understanding the diverse functions of these molecules. A major impediment to developing this understanding is the lack of tools that can monitor these compounds at the temporal, spatial and concentration scales relevant to these brain processes. Filling this technological gap is one of the most pressing needs in neuroscience research. Our proposal directly bridges this gap by developing a platform of new tools for chronic, non- invasive monitoring of neuromodulators at millisecond, subcellular, and nanomolar resolution. Genetically-encoded fluorescent indicators for calcium and glutamate have transformed investigation of dynamic brain processes in the major model systems, including worms, flies, rodents, and increasingly primates. Building on our prior experience in developing these tools, we now propose to build a new suite of GPCR-activation-based (GRAB) genetically-encoded fluorescent indicators for neuromodulators. Our preliminary data shows we can generate GRABs with >500% fluorescence change and nanomolar affinity in mammalian cells. We propose to further develop and validate these prototypes in cultured neurons, flies, rodent brain slices, anesthetized and behaving mice to maximize their utility. In Aim 1, we will develop GRAB indicators for acetylcholine, serotonin, and norepinephrine by iteratively screening libraries that systematically vary in insertion site, linkers, cpGFP sequence, and FP-GPCR protein surface interface. The dimensions of optimization will be dF/F, membrane surface expression, affinity, and non-disruption of endogenous signaling. Our targeted performance levels are >10x dF/F, nanomolar range affinity and <10 millisecond on-rates in vitro. In Aim 2, performance of top candidate GRAB indicators from the in vitro screen will be validated following long-term expression in drosophila olfactory system, in brain slice, in anesthetized and behaving mouse cortex. Feedback from these experiments will guide iterative optimization in Aim 1. Successful completion of our Aims will yield a suite of powerful molecular constructs, cell-type specific viral tools and technical approaches that will be broadly disseminated to the neuroscience community. The GRAB indicators can be easily integrated with existing mouse models of human mental disorders. Since these probes for neuromodulators are well-suited for a wide range of preparations, and a large number of investigators, they will have a multiplicative impact on our understanding of neural circuit function and dysfunction when combined with other advances supported by the BRAIN Initiative."
"9392418","Project summary This project proposes to study mechanisms of synaptic processing within specific ganglion cell types in the mammalian retina, both by direct electrophysiological recording and through the use of realistic computer models. Retinal ganglion cells are the output neurons of the retina. There are around 20-30 types of retinal ganglion cell in a typical mammalian retina, with each type optimized to detect different features in the visual scene. Each retinal ganglion cell type is present as an orderly array of cells that cover the entire retina, and therefore the concerted activity of each ganglion cell type represents a separate version of the visual image. Thus, the brain simultaneously receives 20-30 distinct images that it combines within central visual areas to produce a continuous, coherent model of the visual world. This project focuses on a specific type of retinal ganglion cell that signals direction of motion, called the direction-selective ganglion cell (DSGC). Recordings from DSGCs from in-vitro isolated retina preparations in mouse and rabbit will be used to characterize the electrical and morphological properties of these cells. Realistic computational models of the neural circuitry will be generated based on this information. Recapitulation of the real responses by the model system will be used to test our understanding of the underlying neural circuits. The study comprises three sections. Aim 1 examines the function of the starburst amacrine cell (SBAC), an interneuron that is the source of direction selective inhibitory inputs to the DSGC. This aim tests the hypothesis that several mechanisms in SBAC dendrites generate and amplify the direction-selective inhibitory signal. The computer model of the SBAC circuit will include sodium and calcium channels in a network of SBACs that are interconnected by reciprocal inhibition. Aim 2 tests the hypothesis that surround inhibition modulates the strength and spatial and temporal resolution of the synaptic input to the DSGC. The experimental results will be used to extend the computer model to take into account the inhibitory inputs from amacrine cells that integrate information over larger regions of the visual scene surrounding the DSGC. Aim 3 examines the reliability in the spiking output of the DSGC, and how this is affected by the presence of ambiguities and noise in the visual input. The data obtained will be used to further develop the computer model to simulate DSGC spike responses. The final model, based on physiological results from all three Aims, will represent a detailed, and essentially complete representation of the neural mechanisms involved in directional signalling in the mammalian retina. If successful, the model should reproduce realistic spiking output for any visual stimulus. Overall, the proposed research will improve our understanding of the complex circuitry of the adult retina; the knowledge gained will inform continuing efforts to develop treatments and visual prosthetic devices that restore vision loss from a range of eye diseases."
"9290770","Abstract  RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) regulate the life cycle of target mRNAs by controlling splicing, polyadenylation, stability, localization and translation, and they also modulate function of non-coding RNAs. Because of their crucial roles in many diverse cellular processes, RBPs are key targets for therapeutic intervention in a variety of human diseases ranging from cancers to neurodegeneration.  We have recently developed a new and unique computational approach for designing inhibitors of a given RBP, starting from its structure in complex with RNA. We have validated this approach by applying it to three separate RBPs, and in each case we have identified inhibitors of our target proteins. Nonetheless, there is room for further improvement in the compounds we identify using this method. Here, we propose to extend this computational approach, to improve the initial hit compounds? potency, selectivity, and diversity. With these enhancements in place, this approach will provide new chemical tools to explore the biology of individual RBPs at unprecedented detail. To facilitate rapid and broad adoption of this method, we will also make the computational tools accessible through a webserver, so that the community of researchers wishing to design inhibitors for their own RBPs of interest will be able to easily use them.  This research is expected to have an important positive impact because it will provide new insights and tools to address the distinct challenges associated with finding small-molecule inhibitors of protein-RNA interactions. This contribution is significant because a broad assortment of human diseases stem from disregulation of protein-RNA interactions, positioning such inhibitors as potential starting points for developing a variety of new therapeutic agents."
"9378399","Project Summary Abstract Acute kidney injury (AKI) in the intensive care unit is common and highly associated with morbidity and mortality. AKI is an abrupt decline in renal function due to glomerular or tubular dysfunction. The current, most widely accepted definition of AKI from the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) group, classifies patients based on a maximum creatinine or a minimum urine output throughout their hospital stay from stage 0 (no AKI) to stage 3 AKI. However AKI is a heterogeneous disease with differing risk factors, pathophysiology and clinical outcomes. This heterogeneity may reflect our incomplete understanding of the biology of AKI and likely contributes to the poor track record of novel therapies for patients with AKI. In other heterogeneous diseases, such as lung cancer, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), or asthma, identification of sub-phenotypes has led to improved understanding of pathogenesis and has had implications for individualized care. Unlike other diseases in AKI there has been few studies identifying sub-phenotypes. The overall study objective is to categorize novel sub-phenotypes of AKI in the ICU, determine the association of sub-phenotypes with short and long-term clinical outcomes and identify molecular pathways associated with AKI sub-phenotypes. This project accomplishes the overall study objective by pursuing the following two specific aims: 1) Compare sub-phenotypes of AKI either defined by the latent class analysis (LCA) or by a trajectory based approach in terms of their relation to short and long-term outcomes; 2) Identify plasma biomarkers that differentiate AKI sub-phenotypes from a panel of biomarkers reflecting endothelial dysfunction (angiopoietin 1, 2 and vascular endothelial growth factor) and inflammation (interleukin 6, 8 and TNF alpha, TNFR-1). Refining the classification of patients with AKI in the ICU is foundationally essential to further research in this heterogeneous disease. Expected results will allow identification of patients at risk of poor outcomes, allow for inclusion of homogeneous populations in future clinical trials, characterize biological pathways to target with novel therapies and support future research to evaluate genetic risk factors associated with the development of AKI."
"9482305","Summary  For men who have sex with men (MSM) who engage in exchange sex (i.e., offering sex in exchange for money, drugs, shelter, or goods), gay hookup apps and websites have become a common venue for meeting clients. Further, it has been argued that these new technologies have made male sex work safer, more anonymous and normalized in the gay community, thus likely diversifying and expanding the number of MSM who participate in exchange sex. However, this population of MSM is currently not well characterized or understood from a public health perspective. The goal of the study is to investigate a very under-studied population?MSM who use hookup apps/websites to find clients for exchange sex. The proposed research will be extremely valuable in better characterizing this population and its sexual practices, risk behavior, and risk reduction strategies. We will also examine participants? HIV and STI testing behavior and their attitudes toward PrEP. Because exchange sex is most prevalent among Black, Hispanic, and White MSM ages 18?45, we will conduct in-depth qualitative interviews with an ethnically diverse sample of 180 HIV-uninfected MSM (60 Black, 60 Latino, and 60 White participants, half of them ages 18?29 and half 30?45). To better understand the factors associated with sexual risk taking among men who engage in exchange sex, half of the men in each age and racial/ethnic group will have only had protected sex (either consistent condom use or consistent use of PrEP) and half will have had unprotected anal sex (condomless sex without taking PrEP) with their clients in the prior three months. The study aims are: 1. To investigate participants? pathways into exchange sex, how they use hookup apps/websites to find and negotiate with clients, and how they evaluate the worth of different acts and partners. 2. To investigate the heuristics and risk-reduction strategies?including PrEP and HIV and STI testing?participants use to try to manage the risks of becoming HIV infected and their reasons for their choices. 3. To investigate what types of HIV/STI and sexual health interventions participants would find useful, how they would like these delivered, and then, use findings to develop a provisional intervention to reduce sexual-risk behavior among MSM who use hookup apps/websites to find clients for exchange sex."
"9367925","PROJECT ABSTRACT Progressive retinal dystrophies, including retinitis pigmentosa and macular degeneration, are frequently caused by dominant negative mutations in which the disease could be cured by the silencing the mutant allele. Until recently, this task was impossible. However, the advent of CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing raises the exciting possibility of curing the disease by selectively inactivating the dominant disease-causing allele, while preserving the normal allele. As a proof-of-concept, we will focus on bestrophin, a protein encoded by the BEST1 gene that forms a calcium-activated chloride channel expressed in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). The most common BEST1-related disease is called ?Best disease? (BD), which is caused by >200 different dominant-negative protein coding mutations that result in defective chloride channel function, sub- retinal lipid accumulation, and macular atrophy. Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from BD patients develop into RPE with disease phenotypes, such as abnormal chloride channel conductance and bestrophin mislocalization. DNA excision with dual cutting Cas9 is remarkably efficient, and by targeting Cas9 with guide RNAs (gRNA) to common polymorphisms on the same allele as (in cis with) the disease mutation, we propose to eliminate the disease protein. By targeting common polymorphisms, we hope to treat a majority of BD patients with just a few gRNA pairs. Although therapeutic editing for BD is promising, many daunting challenges remain. 1. How can we be confident that inactivation of the disease allele will cure the disease? 2. How do we efficiently identify polymorphisms in cis within a 20-30 kb genomic window that can be used for dual Cas9 excision of one allele, while leaving the other allele intact? (Fig. 5). 3. What are the ideal methods to introduce editing DNA/RNA/proteins into RPE for efficient and specific editing? 4. How do we assess the off- target editing for different SNPs and different methods of inserting Cas9 into cells? 5. Can we minimize off- target DNA damage using alternative forms of Cas9? We will systematically address each of these questions with a combination of bioinformatics, cell biology, and bioengineering with these aims:  Aim 1. Determine the efficacy of allele-specific editing and the rescue of BD-associated RPE phenotypes using fluorescent reporter iPSCs  Aim 2. Test allele-specific gRNAs for inactivation of disease alleles in RPE from 10 BD patients  Aim 3. Determine the fidelity of the most robust allele-specific editing BD is a fertile testing ground for therapeutic editing, since RPE can readily be derived from iPSCs for in vitro studies, and is already the target of cell and gene therapy trials. Our studies also have larger implications: our methods are applicable to any dominant negative genetic disease where the selective removal of a single allele could be therapeutic. For instance, dominant negative disease of photoreceptors (e.g., RHO), auditory cells, nervous system, and muscle, are potential targets in the future."
"9360010","Abstract  Over 30% of neuropathic pain conditions in Veterans are due to peripheral nerve injury from physical or surgical related trauma. Peripheral nerve injury often results in the formation of neuroma/nerve entrapment, a persistent neuropathic pain state accompanied by sensory hypersensitivity and uncontrollable spontaneous pain sensation at the injury site. Current available medications for neuropathic pain often consist of untoward side effects and/or abusive risks. Invasive measures such as surgical resection or local injections of steroid and local anesthetics at the injury/neuroma site are often ineffective in alleviating the symptoms and the invasive nature of the procedure is usually painful for the patients. Therefore, there is a need in the field of pain management in developing means of non-invasive and non-contact therapy in treating post-traumatic peripheral neuropathic pain (PTP-NP) states. The pain service at the VA San Diego Healthcare System (VASDHS) has recently adopted the use of transcutaneous magnetic stimulation (tMS) in treating PTP-NP and noticed encouraging pain relief benefit in patients with PTP-NP. The PI also completed a mechanistic nerve conduction study and showed that this treatment method can potentially restore lost neuronal functions associated with PTP-NP. Our initial pilot data from a randomized controlled study support the feasibility of conducting a larger scale randomized controlled clinical trial to adequately assess the effect of tMS in treating PTP-NP and improving patients' function. To validate tMS as a non-contact and non-invasive pain treatment option for reducing pain in Veterans with PTP-NP and improving their overall functions, the proposed study will assess: 1) the effect of transcutaneous magnetic stimulation (tMS) in alleviating post-traumatic peripheral neuropathic pain (PTP-NP); 2) the effect of tMS in improving quality of life and functions in Veterans with PTP-NP."
"9337581","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia and a major public health problem. Data from genetic, biochemical, animal, and human studies suggest that the amyloid-? (A?) peptide plays a key early role in initiating disease pathogenesis and that the microtubule associated protein tau plays a critical role in neurodegeneration and disease progression. Progressive accumulation of A? in the brain appears to ultimately lead to and exacerbate downstream events directly linked to cognitive decline and dementia such as inflammation and tau aggregation. Prior to this PPG proposal, we found that synaptic and network activity is tightly coupled with the release of the A? peptide in the extracellular space of the brain as part of a normal biological process. Our labs discovered some of the cellular mechanisms that link synaptic transmission and network activity with dynamic changes in A? levels in awake, behaving mice with confirmation in human studies. This collaborative work led to the submission and funding of the current PPG which has been funded from 4/1/12 to the present. We have made substantial progress over the last 4 years. Some key findings are that the sleep/wake cycle regulates A? levels dynamically with A? release being higher during wake and lower during sleep. This effect, at least in part, is via neuronal activity differences between wake and sleep. We also found that A? and tau release by neurons is controlled by synaptic activity and can be monitored dynamically. It was also found that A? levels, clearance, and aggregation can be strongly influenced by neuronal LRP1 and heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPG). In addition to our findings, increasing evidence indicates that once key proteins involved in neurodegenerative diseases aggregate in the brain (e.g. A? and tau), they appear to spread from one region to others within neuronal networks that are synaptically connected. There is also growing evidence that in AD, A? aggregation in some way drives the progression and spread of tauopathy. We believe that new studies are now warranted to understand the relationship between synaptic and network activity, the sleep/wake cycle, and the impact of the apoE/HSPG/LRP1 on A?, tau, and the spreading of these protein aggregates in the brain. The overall hypothesis of this PPG renewal is that the sleep-wake cycle and brain network activity modulates both A? and tau aggregation and the effect of A? on tau spreading. We further hypothesize that apoE/LRP1/HSPG pathways influence these effects. We will utilize innovative techniques and approaches to study these hypotheses such as the use of DREADDs, in vivo microdialysis, and microimmunoelectrodes as well as a variety of genetically modified mouse models and viral vectors. The specific projects and Cores are listed here. Project 1, D. Holtzman, PI: Effects of the sleep/wake cycle on A?, tau, and spreading. Project 2, J.

"9566373","Our aging population is at an exceptionally high risk of debilitating falls, contributing significantly to reduced independence and quality of life. Despite conventional diagnostic and rehabilitative efforts, one-third of people over age 65 fall annually and 20-30% of these falls lead to moderate to severe injury. Remarkably, evidence even suggests that the rate of injurious falls among older adults is accelerating. Through an innovative sensorimotor paradigm using optical flow perturbations in a custom virtual environment, this proposal seeks to address the critical and immediate need for transformative new approaches for identifying and mitigating falls risk in our aging population. Our overarching goal is to investigate the efficacy of optical flow perturbations, particularly when applied during walking, to: (i) elucidate aging and falls history effects on standing and walking balance control, and (ii) subsequently condition successful balance control strategies through training. The first aim will tightly integrate virtual reality, visuomotor entrainment (i.e., the instinctive synchronization of motor responses to visual stimuli), and a series of clinical and self-reported benchmarks to investigate aging and falls history effects on the response to optical flow perturbations during standing and walking. We will test the hypothesis that optical flow perturbations during walking will distinguish age and falls history more effectively than those during standing and with effect sizes larger than those from conventional balance testing. The second aim will investigate sensory, motor, and cognitive-motor mechanisms governing susceptibility to optical flow perturbations. Using a strategically-selected combination of outcome measures and multivariate modeling, we will test the hypothesis that entrainment to optical flow perturbations will correlate most strongly with visual dependence and decreased somatosensory function, alluding to an age-associated process of multi-sensory reweighting that will emerge most prominently in walking. Finally, our third aim is designed to gain preliminary insight into the efficacy of prolonged optical flow perturbations to condition strategies used to successfully control walking balance in older adult fallers. In a randomized cross-over design, older adults with a history of falls will complete two treadmill training sessions ? one with (i.e., ?training? session) and one without (i.e., ?control? session) dynamic optical flow perturbations. We will test the hypothesis that older adults with a history of falls will adapt to prolonged exposure to perturbations, conditioning their step to step adjustments in walking balance control and improving their response to unexpected balance challenges following training. This research represents an interdisciplinary collaboration involving experienced investigators in biomedical engineering, physical therapy, and motor control. Successful completion of this R21 will provide the necessary mechanistic and preliminary efficacy information needed to design larger diagnostic and intervention studies to determine the value and applicability of perturbed optical flow to mitigate fall risk. With the advent of wearable and low cost virtual reality technology, this proposal is both timely and clinically feasible."
"9373191","PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT The long-term goal of this clinical research is to develop an oral treatment to prevent or slow the pro- gression of Stargardt disease (STGD), a leading, but rare form of juvenile blindness with a prevalence of 1 in 10,000 in the United States. There is no FDA-approved cure or preventative treatment for STGD. Vision loss in STGD is caused by mutations on the ABCA4 gene. These mutations lead to the accelerated formation of toxic vitamin A aggregates called ?vitamin A dimers?. The central hypothesis is that retarding the formation of these dimers will slow the development and/or progression of STGD. This study will investigate the effects of a mole- cule called ALK-001, which inhibits the dimerization of vitamin A, on the progression of STGD.  In rodent models of STGD, administration of ALK-001 for over one year, led to significant, sustained slowing of vitamin A dimerization, and to preservation of visual function. In a 4-week long, multi-dose, phase 1a clinical study in healthy volunteers, and in an 8-week long phase 1b in patients with Stargardt disease, ALK- 001 reached ?bioactive levels?, was well-tolerated by all subjects, and showed no side effects or toxicity. For ALK-001 to become a FDA-approved therapeutic however, it must first be evaluated in Phase 2 then Phase 3 clinical trials. The specific objective of this application is to collect additional data regarding the safety and ef- fects of ALK-001 so that Phase 3, confirmatory trials can be designed and performed. This will be achieved by completing the following specific aim: Perform a 24-month, randomized, double-masked, placebo-controlled study with a cross-over arm, in 50 subjects with STGD, to evaluate the safety, tolerability and effects of ALK- 001 on the progression of STGD. This study will be performed at multiple clinical sites across the United States. Safety outcome measures include: adverse events (AE), serious adverse events (SAE), 12-lead elec- trocardiograms, vital signs, physical exam, ocular exam, blood tests (liver enzymes, blood chemistry, hematol- ogy, and lipid panels). Efficacy outcome measures include size of atrophic lesions by fundus autofluorescence (FAF), best-corrected visual acuity, microperimetry, optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT), visual function questionnaire, reading speed, and dark adaptation.  Completion of the proposed work will generate clinical data to: (a) assess the safety and tolerability of 24 months of daily dosing of ALK-001 in STGD patients; (b) determine the quantity of ALK-001 and its metabo- lites in plasma, in response to daily dosing for up to 24 months; (c) obtain estimates of the effect size of ALK- 001 on the progression of STGD, as measured by changes in: areas of significantly decreased FAF, micrope- rimetry, visual acuity, reading speed, retinal thickness and/or volume by OCT; (d) explore dose-response de- pendencies using the above efficacy and safety parameters; and (e) gather data to better understand how STGD progresses. The above data will be used to power a Phase 3 safety and efficacy study to evaluate the extent to which inhibiting the dimerization of vitamin A in the retina prevents vision loss due to STGD, and to finalize the clinical development of a possible treatment for STGD. An oral drug to prevent or slow the worsen- ing of STGD would have tremendous impact on the quality of life of people with STGD."
"9444301","A Brain Circuit Program for Understanding the Sensorimotor Basis of Behavior Abstract The Project team's long-term goal is to develop a comprehensive theory of animal behavior that explicitly incorporates neural processes operating across hierarchical levels ? from circuits that regulate the action of individual muscles to those that regulate behavioral sequences and decisions. Our innovative approach is guided by the notion that different brain regions are not linked within a single neuroanatomical tier, but rather constitute a series of hierarchically nested feedback loops. The effort is organized into four Research Projects, each focusing on a different processing stage related to: (1) muscle action, (2) motor patterns, (3) motion guidance, and (4) behavioral sequences. Demonstrating our commitment to team interaction, these Research Projects are not organized according to PIs laboratories, but rather each constitutes a collaborative multi- laboratory effort. The collective expertise of our research team spans the entire nervous system - from the sensory periphery to the motor periphery and was chosen to include experts in every experimental technique we require (molecular genetics, electrophysiology, optical imaging, biomechanics, quantitative behavioral analysis, control theory, and dynamic network theory). We will exploit mathematical approaches ? control theory and dynamic network theory in particular ? that are best suited to model feedback and the flow of information through and among different processing stages in the brain. The four complimentary and integrated Research Projects will focus on ethologically relevant natural behaviors, with an emphasis on recording methods that interrogate the functions of genetically identified neurons in intact, behaving animals ? a rigorous standard that is designed to have the broadest impact on systems neuroscience. Our research exploits a single, experimentally tractable model system (Drosophila melanogaster), in which we can easily study the functions of genetically identified cell classes in ethologically relevant behaviors. Our experiments emphasize methods that interrogate the functions of neurons in intact, behaving animals, a rigorous standard that is designed to have the broadest impact on systems neuroscience. Our research will be supported by an Instrumentation and Software Resource Core that will develop and support novel devices and software, so that we can continue to employ state-of-the-art experimental techniques and data analysis. Collectively, our research program constitutes a systematic attack on the neural basis of behavior that integrates vertically across phenomenological tiers. The result of our effort will be a new synthesis of how a fully embodied brain works to generate behavior.  "
"9337267","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Growing deployments of electronic health records (EHRs) systems have made massive clinical data available electronically. However, much of detailed clinical information of patients is embedded in narrative text and is not directly accessible for computerized clinical applications. Therefore, natural language processing (NLP) technologies, which can unlock information in narrative document, have received great attention in the medical domain. Current state-of-the-art NLP approaches often involve building probabilistic models. However, the wide adoption of statistical methods in clinical NLP faces two grand challenges: 1) the lack of large annotated clinical corpora; and 2) the lack of methodologies that can efficiently integrate linguistic and domain knowledge with statistical learning. High-performance statistical NLP methods rely on large scale and high quality annotations of clinical text, but it is time-consuming and costly to create large annotated clinica corpora as it often requires manual review by physicians. Moreover, the medical domain is knowledge intensive. To achieve optimal performance, probabilistic models need to leverage medical domain knowledge. Therefore, methods that can efficiently integrate domain and expert knowledge with machine learning processes to quickly build high-quality probabilistic models with minimum annotation cost would be highly desirable for clinical text processing.    In this study, we propose to investigate interactive machine learning (IML) methods to address the above challenges in clinical NLP. An IML system builds a classification model in an iterative process, which can actively select informative samples for annotation based on models built on previously annotated samples, thus reducing the annotation cost for model development. More importantly, an IML system also involves human inputs to the learning process (e.g., an expert can specify important features for a classification task based on domain knowledge). Thus, IML is an ideal framework for efficiently integrating rule-based (via domain experts specifying features) and statistics-based (via different learning algorithms) approaches to clinical NLP. To achieve our goal, we propose three specific aims. In Aim 1, we plan to investigate different aspects of IML for word sense disambiguation, including developing new active learning algorithms and conducting cognitive usability analysis for efficient feature annotation by users. To demonstrate the broad uses of IML, we further extend IML approaches to two other important clinical NLP classification tasks: named entity recognition and clinical phenoytping in Aim 2. Finally we propose to disseminate the IML methods and tools to the biomedical research community in Aim 3."
"9381634","Project Summary  To maintain body core temperature (TCORE) in mammals, the central nervous system thermoregulatory networks respond to skin cooling by increasing brown adipose tissue and shivering thermogenesis, and by reducing heat loss via cutaneous vasoconstriction. However, there are several conditions (e.g., hibernation, torpor, REM sleep) in which these ?standard? thermoregulatory responses to protect TCORE appear to be superseded by a ?thermoregulatory inversion? in which cold exposure causes inhibition of thermogenesis and warm exposure stimulates thermogenesis. We hypothesize that blockade of POA thermoregulatory function is required for the initiation of thermoregulatory inversion and that such paradoxical thermoregulation is governed by a new central thermoregulatory pathway. We will employ in vivo neurophysiological studies in anesthetized rats, a parallel demonstration of thermoregulatory inversion in a free-behaving rat model, and state-of-the-art anatomical studies to understand the relevant neural pathways regulating thermoregulatory inversion. This study will open a new field of research in thermoregulation and will elucidate a new mechanism for a rapid, controllable, stable and reversible induction of hypothermia for the treatment of ischemic stroke, brain trauma and to block persistent, high neurogenic fevers."
"9491282","Consumers, providers and health care purchasers need high-quality information to help them compare and evaluate their health care options. The CAHPS V project will advance the AHRQ CAHPS mission of improving patients' experiences with health care by developing and evaluating strategies for survey measurement, reporting and quality improvement (QI). We propose a 5-year effort to advance the science and practice of patient experience assessment, continue innovation to ensure relevance to health service delivery and implement best survey practices, further the science of reporting, and evaluate CAHPS QI efforts. We will develop program communication strategies, and disseminate and promote use of CAHPS products. In particular, we will develop a survey to assess patient experiences with end-of-life care; develop new items to assess shared decision-making, care coordination, patient engagement, and patient safety; test alternatives to the standard CAHPS modes of data collection), explore the feasibility of administering a short-form survey dividing CG-CAHPS composites among respondents to reduce response burden, elicit stakeholder feedback about the value of different CAHPS supplement item sets, evaluate ?The Your CAHPS Survey? that was designed to help users of the CAHPS surveys compile a survey tailed to their specific needs, and evaluate existing Spanish translations of CAHPS surveys. In addition, we will gather input from stakeholders on best practices for narrative data analysis, develop an approach for using automated Natural Language Processing for analyses of narratives, and construct an algorithm approach to select representative narratives that reflect and illustrate overall provider ratings. Finally, we will evaluate the contribution of patient narratives to quality improvement efforts in hospital care for children, characterize primary care practices use of the CG-CAHPS survey and patient-centered medical home items during PCMH transformation, assess the impact of pay- for-performance for care delivered by primary and specialty care safety net providers on CAHPS survey responses, explore the value of new shared decision-making, patient engagement, communication and patient safety items for QI and identify QI strategies that improve patient experience across various settings. We will also advance analytic methods for CAHPS data. The project team is well suited to achieving the study objectives given its prior accomplishments and established working relationships. The work is innovative and designed to facilitate the use of CAHPS surveys and improve response rates to them, enhance reporting and use of CAHPS survey data, and improve health care QI efforts."

"9423595","A. Project summary/abstract The goal of this project is to develop positron emission tomography (PET) tracers which quantitatively measure the expression of the sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 1 (S1P1). Sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) is a membrane-derived lysophospholipid that plays critical regulatory roles in inflammatory diseases through modulating five S1P receptor subtypes. S1P1 is one of the most abundant receptors in this family. Dysregulation of S1P1 signaling is associated with inflammatory diseases in multiple organ systems, including the central nervous system (CNS). The FDA approved S1P-modulator, FTY720 (fingolimod), has been widely used for treatment of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RR-MS); fingolimod has high affinity to all S1P subtypes except S1P2, but its function mainly relies on its binding with S1P1. Although positive results in treating RR-MS with fingolimod illustrate the importance of this pathway in chronic inflammatory disease, the mechanisms by which S1P1 mediates pathological changes in MS as well as in other diseases are still not well understood. A PET tracer with high affinity and selectivity for S1P1 would provide a unique imaging tool to quantify S1P1 expression in inflamed tissue, thus helping physicians monitor the therapeutic efficacy of S1P1 inhibition in individual patients by assessing changes in S1P1 expression post-treatment. To test this hypothesis, we radiosynthesized the known S1P1 inhibitor, 11C-TZ3321 (IC50 = 2.13 ± 1.63 nM for S1P1, >1000 nM for S1P2- 5). Our preclinical data from three different animal models of inflammatory diseases suggest 11C-TZ3321 can be used to quantify S1P1 expression in vivo. We subsequently identified several lead compounds for future 18F- labeling that have high potency (IC50 < 20 nM for S1P1) and selectivity (IC50 >1000 nM for S1P2-5). We have proposed two specific aims to achieve our goal. Specific aim #1 is to translate 11C-TZ3321 into clinical investigation for proof of mechanism studies in RR-MS patients. Our multi-disciplinary team will carry out translational 11C-TZ3321 PET studies in MS patients and healthy volunteers to determine if S1P1 expression reflects the severity of MS and if changes of S1P1 expression reflect the therapeutic efficacy of treating MS with fingolimod. Specific aim #2 is to develop an 18F-labeled S1P1 specific PET radiotracer. We will optimize the lead structures of S1P1 compounds and perform in vitro binding assay to identify potent and selective compounds that can be 18F-labeled. Upon the success of 18F-labeling, we will perform in the rat EAE model of MS will be used for the preclinical evaluation of new 18F-labeled S1P1 PET tracers. We anticipate identifying a candidate 18F-labeled S1P1 specific radiotracer for future translational investigation of inflammatory response in human disease."
"9445112","ABSTRACT A Career Development Award in HIV-Associated Preterm Birth and its Prevention This application to the Fogarty International Research Scientist Development Award (IRSDA) will provide Dr. Joan Price with the support she needs to advance to the next stage in her career development. Dr. Price is an obstetrician-gynecologist at the University of North Carolina (UNC) with a long-held commitment to global women's health. She has lived full-time in Lusaka, Zambia since July 2016 where she has established a solid career foundation for clinical, epidemiologic, and implementation research around HIV and obstetric outcomes. The IRSDA will provide a structured framework to gain experience in each of these fields, supporting both didactic and experiential learning opportunities for rapid career progression toward research independence. She has also assembled a strong multidisciplinary team of investigators committed to her career development. Dr. Price's IRSDA research will take advantage of two newly-funded trials of progesterone to prevent preterm birth (PTB) among HIV infected women in Zambia. She proposes three aims, each linked to a robust career development plan focused on epidemiologic and health economics methods. First, she will investigate whether the timing of ART initiation is associated with PTB within the trial cohorts and whether the progesterone intervention shows improved efficacy in the subgroup of women newly starting ART in pregnancy. She will bring her obstetrical expertise to the trials and ensure that key data (e.g., ultrasound biometry, PTB phenotyping) are collected for her analyses. With formal training in causal inference coupled with expert mentorship, she will use marginal structural models to address the numerous potential confounders and biases that have long been associated with similar analyses. Second, Dr. Price will perform serum assessment of exogenous progesterone concentrations to evaluate the extent to which this biomarker correlates with risk of preterm birth. This activity will provide an opportunity to apply her learning in survival analysis. Third, Dr. Price will measure the healthcare- associated costs of caring for a preterm infant and of delivering a public-sector progesterone supplementation program. Once these are obtained, she will construct a decision analysis model and estimate the incremental cost-effectiveness of progesterone to prevent PTB among women with a proven indication (prior PTB, short cervix) and women with the indication being tested in the ongoing trials (HIV). Each of these separate research aims will take advantage of the ongoing parent trials, but none are dependent upon the final trial outcome. The results will contribute to the growing field of HIV and adverse birth outcomes, afford a foundation of career development, and provide important preliminary data for Dr. Price as she pursues independent NIH funding."
"9355159","Project Summary/Abstract This application is intended to support funding for three future meetings of the Quality & Patient Safety TAG as part of the World Health Organization's ongoing development of the International Classification of Diseases, 11th edition. The group has worked horizontally across all ICD-11 chapters to advise the WHO on optimizing the entire content and structure of the classification system to better capture important concepts relevant to measuring health system quality and safety and was able to provide significant contributions to the revision process across all TAGs as reflected in the beta-version of ICD 11 (made available to the public in May 2012). Future work of the Q&S TAG will seamlessly take up on previously conducted conferences and will focus on the following five aims:  I. The first aim is to enhance the capacity of ICD to capture information related to quality and safety to  facilitate quality monitoring and improvement in the US and internationally through continuing review  and refinement of the ICD-11 beta-draft including vertical chapter content and alphanumeric coding  schemes from the perspective of the quality and safety use case (e.g., codes for Beta Joint Linearization).  II. Secondly, the proposed work aims to ensure continuing coordination between AHRQ's Patient Safety  Formats and ICD-11, particularly harmonizing patient safety clinical definitions, related terminology and  future code development; and aligning both systems to support adverse event reporting, surveillance,  use of electronic health.  III. The third aim is to enhance collaborative activities between the US, the WHO and other countries with  particular focus on further refinement of morbidity and mortality coding rules to improve data  comparability; review of field trials for ICD-11 designed and run by members of the Q&S TAG; and  assessment of potential uses of ICD-11 for health services, comparative effectiveness, quality  improvement, and patient centered outcomes research.  IV. Furthermore, the Quality & Patient Safety TAG aims to explore potential US application of new ICD-11  concepts introduced by Q&S TAG for ICD-10 CM.  V. The fifth and final aim is to encourage effective coordination in the implementation of ICD 11 and AHRQ  Patient Safety Formats and other US and WHO efforts to compile and use quality and patient safety data. The ultimate objective of the Q&S TAG's work is an enhanced international classification system that will permit expanded use of coded health data for large scale quality and safety surveillance in health care systems in the US and internationally and facilitation of health services research and patient centered outcomes research using large scale data sets. Conferences of the Q&S TAG not only provide an important platform for advancing the Q&S TAG's work with regard to developing ICD-11 but support and enhance knowledge translation and exchange among a broader audience of international coding experts and health services researchers through dissemination and publication of the groups work in scientific journals and postings on IMECCHI's website."
"9483053","Project Summary Colorectal cancer (CRC) remains the second leading cause of cancer deaths among Americans underscoring the need for more effective screening practices. Colonoscopy as primary screening has been accompanied by a modest but steady decline in CRC incidence through identification and removal of precursor lesions, the adenomatous polyp. Indeed, there has been a 32% decline between years 2000-2013 in CRC incidence in patients over age 50 (thus eligible for screening). Strikingly, during this same time period, the incidence rate for those under 50 has increased by 22%. Thus, new and effective screening strategies are urgently needed to address the rising burden of CRC (?50 years) which is expected to increase over the next decade with the rising young population. The objective of the R33 Moonshot Project is to develop a highly advanced screening approach to identify the subset of young patients who actually harbor advanced adenomas and could benefit from colonoscopy via a test that is sensitive to advanced adenomas, low-cost, and that can be carried out in a primary care setting. To this end, we have developed a new technology, partial wave spectroscopic (PWS) microscopy or nanocytology. Nanocytology performed on colonocytes swabbed from the rectal mucosa is able to identify nanoscale alterations in higher order chromatin structure, which are highly accurate markers of the presence of advanced adenomas that might be located anywhere in the colon. The goal for the proposed project is to finalize the PWS technology, turn it into a practical, accurate, and low-cost test that is viable for young population screening, and conduct a pre-definitive clinical trial. We aim to achieve sensitivity and specificity over 90%. Upon the completion of this moonshot project, nanocytology will be ready for a definitive clinical trial, which can lead to CLIA approval and launch in clinical practice as a laboratory-developed test (LDT)."
"9377469","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Alcoholism is a chronic, intractable disease characterized by heavy, uncontrollable drinking bouts occurring between periods of abstinence. Current treatments of alcoholism are limited in their ability to eliminate these drinking bouts. Ethanol alters the physiology of various cell types in a basal ganglia nucleus, the dorsolateral striatum (DLS). Chronic intermittent ethanol exposure specifically decreases inhibition onto the principal medium spiny projection neuron (MSN) in this region. The strongest inhibitory influence over MSN output comes from perisomatic innervations arising from the GABAergic fast-spiking interneuron (FSI). We find that this FSI-to-MSN (FSI-MSN) synapse is depressed in the presence of ethanol. Therefore, FSI-MSN depression may underlie the disinhibition of the DLS that occurs during ethanol exposure. Preventing ethanol-induced synaptic depression at this synapse may protect against compulsive drinking behaviors. A form of protection against a type of synaptic depression is known to occur in the marine mollusk Aplysia. A frequency-dependent stimulation protocol protects against the formation of synaptic depression through the activation of protein kinase C-alpha (PKC?), one of the Ca2+ sensitive forms of PKC. Remarkably, we are able to block ethanol-induced depression through a similar frequency-dependent PKC-activated mechanism. Thus, I hypothesize that activation of PKC? in FSIs protects the FSI-MSN synapse from the formation of ethanol-induced synaptic depression. I will test this hypothesis with two specific aims using both ex vivo and in vivo techniques. First, I will elucidate the mechanism underlying the frequency-dependent protection at this synapse using whole-cell patch-clamp electrophysiology and optogenetics. Then, I will demonstrate if frequency-dependent protection blocks ethanol-induced depression of the FSI-MSN synapse during in vivo ethanol consumption. I will test this prediction using in vivo optogenetics and a mouse drinking paradigm. Through these experiments I aim to identify a novel molecular target to offer an effective intervention for  problem drinking, a major initiative stated by the National Institute for Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism."
"9439441","Breast cancer is the most common cancer and the second leading cause of cancer death among American women of all races. Despite improvement of recurrence and survival rates of breast cancer in the United States, significant differences between white and black women remain. Previous studies have found that more advanced and aggressive tumors and less than optimal treatment may explain the higher recurrence and lower survival rates for black women as compared to white women. However, to the best of our knowledge, there has been no research that jointly considers potential factors that include not only individual level information such as treatment history and tumor characteristics, but also provider characteristics, and physical and social environmental information. Due to limitations of current analytic methods and the lack of comprehensive data sets, researchers have not been able to differentiate the relative effect each factor contributes to the overall racial disparities at different levels (census tract or individual levels).  We will use the CDC-funded special studies, including Patterns of Care study, Enhancing Cancer Registry Data for Comparative Effectiveness Research (CER), and the Patient Centered Outcomes Research (PCOR), to examine the determinants of racial disparities in breast cancer survival and recurrence using a novel multilevel mediation analysis. The PoC, CER, and PCOR studies collected complete standard of care and tumor characteristic information for female breast cancer patients. The Louisiana Tumor Registry participated in all these studies and collected the required information from Louisiana breast cancer patients. We plan to link the datasets with census data and many other data sources to obtain environmental and provider information.  We propose a novel statistical method that can jointly consider potentially correlated multiple mediators, and differentiate the indirect effect from every individual factor from different levels that may contribute to the race-breast cancer survival and recurrence relationship. If successful, this proposal will provide the most comprehensive exploration of racial disparities in breast cancer patients? recurrence and survival in the United States."
"9358717","ABSTRACT Asthma and sickle cell disease (SCD) are two chronic conditions associated with increased pediatric mortality, morbidity and health care utilization in the United States. The University of California, San Francisco (UCSF), in partnership with the Vermont Child Health Improvement Program (VCHIP), the Pacific Sickle Cell Regional Collaborative (PSCRC) and the California Health Institute has created the ?IMPLEmenting MEasures NeTwork (IMPLEMENT) for Child Health Network?. The IMPLEMENT Network will evaluate, in 10 different states, two sets of quality measures recently developed by the Pediatric Quality Measures Program (PQMP) in asthma and SCD. The overarching goal of this project is to rigorously evaluate and refine these PQMP measures so that they can be appropriately applied by practitioners, administrators and purchasers to improve health care quality. Our Specific Aims are (Aim 1) to assess the feasibility of implementing the PQMP measures within the Medicaid patient populations. We will partner with Medicaid or state agencies in 4 states (CA, OR, VT, MA). Feasibility will be based on the measurement burden in implementing the PQMP quality measures and whether significant differences can be measured at the state, health plan or provider level. (Aim 2) We will assess the usability of the PQMP measures in driving and defining quality improvement (QI) goals for asthma (in CA, VT) and for SCD through the Pacific Sickle Cell Regional Collaborative (in CA, OR, NV, AZ, WA, AK, ID,HI). We will use the PQMP measures in pediatric QI collaboratives in a variety of settings. We will define usability as the ability of the PQMP quality measures to (i) help create and identify feasible strategies for improvement; to (ii) help evaluate overall improvement during plan-do-study-act (PDSA) cycles; and to (iii) be responsive to QI initiatives. (Aim 3), Based on work from Aims 1 and 2, we will promote the dissemination of the PQMP measures by submitting the quality measures that meet endorsement criteria to the National Quality Forum (NQF). To ensure that we have a broad perspective in our evaluation, we have recruited multidisciplinary Advisory Cores that include experts from professional organizations (American Board of Pediatrics), family advocacy groups, QI networks, Medicaid agencies and Accountable Care Organizations. In addition to knowledge about the feasibility and usability of PQMP measures, the IMPLEMENT Network anticipates making several work products publicly available for dissemination as appropriate, which will facilitate the use of the measures submitted. This includes measure ICD10 codes, programming (data preparation and analysis), abstraction tools and updated technical specifications. The completion of the aims listed above by the IMPLEMENT Network will lead to important improvements that can potentially improve pediatric care and outcomes for all children. These measures will help improve the quality of care for pediatric asthma and sickle cell disease, as well as help administrators, payors and consumers identify higher value care, which will lead to a healthier population."
"9469997","Abstract  Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a debilitating disease involving intrusive memories of a traumatic event, which are due in part to an inability to modify responses to stimuli that are no longer threatening?a process known as extinction. The medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) plays a critical role in extinction by regulating amygdala activity, but the circuit-level mechanisms that support extinction learning are incompletely understood. Converging data indicate that extinction memories are stored in the mPFC through mechanisms that induce synaptic plasticity, new protein synthesis, and potentiated single unit activity. Using two-photon (2P) microscopy, a recent report showed that extinction learning is strongly correlated with spine formation, however, it remains unclear whether and how synaptic remodeling in PFC influences activity in extinction- related circuits, partly because most amygdala-projecting PFC cells reside deep in the medial wall of the PFC, beyond the range of transcranial 2P imaging. Furthermore, the molecular mechanisms that drive extinction- related synapse formation remain unclear. Endocannabinoid (eCB) signaling is a promising candidate. The cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1R) is the primary eCB receptor in the brain, and deletion of these receptors in mice impairs the acquisition of extinction. eCBs are well positioned to regulate dendritic spine remodeling: they bind post-synaptic CB1Rs, which in turn interact with key regulators of the actin cytoskeleton. Importantly, extinction learning is strongly enhanced in humans with a common SNP in the fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) gene, resulting in increased anandamide levels (one of two eCBs) and enhanced CB1R signaling. Similarly, extinction learning and fronto-amygdala connectivity are also enhanced in human variant FAAH knock-in (KI) mice, which were generated by my co-mentor (Francis Lee) to carry the variant FAAH gene and provide a unique, clinically-relevant tool for investigating plasticity mechanisms underlying extinction memory formation. This project will investigate how postsynaptic dendritic spine formation and eCB-mediated plasticity mechanisms support the encoding of an extinction memory trace within the mPFC. My central hypothesis is that eCB signaling facilitates extinction learning by enhancing postsynaptic dendritic spine formation and driving the emergence of tone-sensitive, multicellular ensembles of amygdala-projecting mPFC cells. I will test this hypothesis at three levels of analysis, leveraging new technologies for optically deleting newly formed synapses in the living brain and for 2P imaging of mPFC through chronically implanted microprisms. Completion of these aims will reveal fundamental insights about the circuit-level mechanisms that support extinction learning and define potentially causal roles for synapse formation and eCB signaling. This project also has direct clinical applications for PTSD as it has the potential to tailor extinction-based treatments for patient populations with the FAAH SNP and open new avenues for treatment development"
"9502152","Abstract The opioid crisis in North America comes with a multitude of health consequences, including HIV and Hepatitis C (HCV) outbreaks. HIV and HCV are major contributors to morbidity and mortality among persons who inject drugs (PWID). These infections also bear significant medical costs. While HIV treatment scale-up remains essential, significant improvements in HIV and HCV prevention and care are required to reduce substantially the HIV and HCV burden among PWID. Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) and the HCV cure regimens have transformative potential to reduce these two co-occurring epidemics. A key question for implementation research is how to best integrate these pharmacological advances in prevention and care strategies for PWID. Given the relative dearth of prior research on PrEP among PWID, we critically need to expand our understanding of the potential role of PrEP for PWID engaged in HCV assessment and treatment. Within this context, we propose a randomized hybrid effectiveness-implementation trial (n=500) to evaluate two implementation strategies for PrEP and HCV care integration among PWID: on-site integrated care (PrEP initiation and HCV treatment) vs. off-site referral with patient navigation to specialized care. HIV-negative PWID will be recruited from two venues?opioid substitution therapy (OST) venues and syringe exchange programs (SEPs)?within two North American cities?Miami and Montréal. The cities provide variability in background health access (Montreal-High Services/Low Barriers versus Miami-Low Services/High Barriers); venues provide variability in overhead/resources (OTPs-High Resources versus SEPs-Low Resource). There are two overall aims: 1) To determine if integrated PrEP and HCV treatment offered on-site in treatment and harm reduction settings results in higher rates of a) sustained PrEP adherence and/or b) HCV cure (primary outcomes), compared to an off-site referral with patient navigation, and to c) test the contributions of local environment and venue on primary outcomes, and 2) To evaluate a) the health care utilization impact and the relative resource use of the on-site integrated care approach compared to the referral with patient navigator approach and b) the health care resources required to scale up these intervention approaches in the local environments and settings. Secondary outcomes will include PrEP initiation, use, long-term sustained PrEP adherence, HCV treatment initiation, risk behavior changes, HCV infection/reinfection, and STD/HIV incidence. For these secondary outcomes, we also will include a qualitative study to understand the interplay of the personal, interpersonal, and social contextual factors that may be associated with PrEP adherence and issues of behavioral compensation over time for PWID. Additional qualitative study will examine facilitators and barriers to implementation. This two-city by two-venue design will provide crucial information to understand implementation/dissemination issues in both high and low resource geographic contexts and high and low overhead venues."
"9383749","PROJECT SUMMARY Based on the well-documented relationship that exists between ovarian function and women?s health, for decades hormone therapy was considered by many as the standard-of-care for the management, and even the prevention, of post-menopausal health complications. However, recent clinical trials have raised concerns over hormone therapy and increased risks for coronary heart disease, stroke, blood clots, and cancer. While the general thinking behind hormone therapy ? viz. provision of ovarian hormones lost at menopause would serve as a ?replacement? for failed ovarian function ? seems reasonable, it is perhaps not surprising that replacement of only one (estrogen) or two (estrogen-progestin) of the multitude of bioactive factors produced by the ovaries during reproductive life would ultimately prove insufficient. We have been working on the idea that ?ovarian therapy? would serve as a far better ?replacement? for alleviating health consequences of failed ovarian function with age. We eventually generated a mouse model that maintains an adequate reserve of oocyte-containing follicles, and an ensuing continuation of ovarian function, well into advanced chronological ages. Long-term follow-up work showed this strategy indeed yielded immense health benefits in aging females without an increase in cancer in any tissue. While we were excited to demonstrate this key proof-of-concept in mammals, there was a major downside: the ?gene knockout? approach used was not amenable for translation to women. Nonetheless, the work underscored the importance of continuing efforts to elucidate mechanisms underlying endowment and depletion of oocyte-containing follicles in the context of ovarian aging. This led us to discover the existence of female germline or oogonial stem cells (OSCs) in mice and then in humans, and the role these cells play in supporting ovarian function during adulthood. Of the many new areas this paradigm shift opened, one of the most exciting revolves around the use of regenerative medicine to extend functional ovarian lifespan into later ages of life. Achieving this, however, will require a detailed understanding of cues that drive OSC differentiation, and how aging impacts on these cues such that the ability of ovaries to sustain their oocyte reserves becomes compromised with age. To this end we found that application of mechanical ?strain? to OSCs activates their differentiation into oocytes. We also found that ovarian matrix proteins, which directly influence biomechanical properties of tissue, not only decline with age but also serve as direct activators of OSC differentiation. Here we have designed a number of in-vitro and in-vivo studies to rigorously test the hypothesis that progressive loss of mouse and human OSC function in ovaries with age is directly tied to a reduction in biomechanical stimulatory signaling occurring concomitant with aging-associated changes in matrix proteins. Completion of these studies will both support our central hypothesis as well as more broadly highlight the significance of mechanotransduction to adult stem cell function in the context of organ failure with age."
"9484499","Project Summary/Abstract  South Asian Americans have higher diabetes prevalence compared with non-Hispanic whites, other Asian groups, and racial/ethnic minority groups. However, there are few culturally and linguistically adapted interventions for diabetes management for this population. Community health worker (CHW) approaches have demonstrated efficacy for diabetes control in African American and Latino populations, but have not been systematically adapted and tested in South Asian communities. Recent efforts to expand electronic health record (EHR) systems across health care delivery organizations and harness that data infrastructure for patient-centered care have underscored the potential of strengthening care coordination teams through CHW integration for underserved populations. However, the upstream determinants of diabetes management are often viewed as outside of the clinical setting and not addressed in the context of care. By bridging community and health care systems, CHWs can help address these determinants. Mechanisms to effectively link primary care systems, CHWs, and community resources can be accelerated through health information technology (HIT) tools.  Led by Dr. Nadia Islam, the proposed project leverages a well-established multi-sector and community- engaged collaboration to improve diabetes management among New York City South Asians with diabetes. This project will evaluate the effectiveness and implementation process of a multi-level intervention to support diabetes management for South Asian patients with uncontrolled diabetes. The integrated intervention tackles multiple levels and domains of influence as described in the NIMHD Framework on Minority Health & Health Disparities: 1) EHR-based registry system to identify patients with uncontrolled diabetes; 2) Culturally and linguistically adapted CHW-led intervention designed to improve self-management of diabetes among patients using individual and family-based approaches; 3) Linkage to culturally relevant community-level resources using HIT tools; and 4) CHW-integration into primary care teams. The specific aims of the project are to: 1) Test the effectiveness of a multi-level diabetes management intervention compared to usual care; and 2) Use a mixed-methods approach to systematically assess the implementation process and delineate factors influencing adoption, fidelity, and maintenance of the intervention within clinical and community settings.  Using a stepped wedge design, we will enroll 3,994 South Asian patients with uncontrolled diabetes in 25 primary care practice settings. This study will inform efforts to manage diabetes in a high-risk population. We will also generate a reproducible and sustainable model for use in healthcare and community settings engaging vulnerable populations that can potentially be replicated for the prevention and management of other chronic diseases, including cardiovascular disease and cancer."
"9216116","Summary:  Neuromyelitis optica (NMO) is a rare but devastating inflammatory disorder of the central nervous system (CNS) that primarily affects the optic nerves and spinal cord. NMO was initially characterized as a subset of multiple sclerosis (MS), but is now considered a distinct disease. Currently, there are no FDA approved therapies for NMO. In fact, many MS therapies, most notably interferon-beta (IFN-?), worsens NMO. The limited therapies for NMO demonstrates that this disease has clear unmet needs in neurology. The goal of this project is to understand the immune pathways that contribute to disease activity in NMO. The aims of this proposal will address three connected but distinct issues that will have an impact NMO patients. Aim 1 will how determine how IFN-? signaling effects B-cells from patients with NMO. This will be achieved by CyTOF and transcriptomic analysis of B-cells from patients. Aim 2 will assess the direct interaction between B-cell subsets and T helper cells from NMO and healthy volunteers by utilizing cell culturing techniques. Aim 3 will utilize variations of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis model to understand how the B-cells cytokines effect TH17- induced neuro-autoimmune disease. The first two aims of this proposal will be a highly translation collaboration between Drs. Axtell, Lessard (autoimmune geneticist) and Pardo (the director of OMRF's MS Center of Excellence), and the Accelerated Cure Project (ACP). The clinical expertise and large patient population of the OMRF MS Center and the ACP will provide to this project will enable these aims to be accomplished. The third aim utilizes our strength in animal models of neuro-autoimmunity that will give insight into the biological mechanisms behind NMO. The combination of research on human subject and the mechanistic animal experiments outlined in this proposal have the potential to give deep insight into pathological processes that underlie and NMO.  "
"9457862","We have recently shown in preclinical studies using clinically relevant pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) models that angiotensin system inhibitors (ASIs), including the angiotensin receptor blocker losartan, can enhance the delivery and efficacy of cytotoxic agents by affecting the tumor microenvironment (PNAS 2011, Nat Commun 2013). The mechanisms underlying this benefit include ?normalization? of cancer-associated fibroblasts and extracellular matrix (ECM), resulting in blood vessel decompression, improved perfusion, and decreased hypoxia. These exciting preclinical findings formed the basis of an ongoing Phase II clinical trial at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH), which combines losartan with cytotoxic therapy ? FOLFIRINOX and then chemoradiotherapy in unresectable locally advanced PDAC (NCT01821729). An interim analysis of this trial indicates that adding losartan to neoadjuvant cytotoxic therapy doubles the frequency of conversion to resectable tumors (52%) and strikingly improves overall survival (OS) in these PDAC patients. Remarkably, transcriptomic analysis of tumor biopsies from PDAC patients further indicates that ASI treatment not only normalizes ECM-related phenotypes but also upregulates key pathways associated with anti-tumor immunity involving both adaptive (e.g., CD8+ T cells) and innate (e.g., dendritic cells (DCs)) immune components of the PDAC tumor microenvironment. Based on these preclinical and clinical findings, we hypothesize that ASIs in combination with cytotoxic agents will reprogram the heterogeneous, pro-fibrotic, and immunosuppressive PDAC tumor microenvironment to one that is immunostimulatory. We further propose that combining ASIs and cytotoxic agents will enhance the delivery and efficacy of immunotherapies, which until now have had limited or no benefit in PDAC patients. To test these hypotheses, we designed three Specific Aims: 1) Uncover how losartan combined with cytotoxic agents alters tumor microenvironmental components (ECM, blood vessels, hypoxia) and immune cells, in locally advanced PDAC patients; 2) Dissect the causal role of drug- induced adaptive and innate immune cells in the anti-tumor response in orthotopic (implanted and genetically engineered) PDAC models in mice; and 3) Evaluate whether combining ASI-induced tumor microenvironment reprogramming along with cytotoxic therapies enhances the efficacy of immune checkpoint blockers. Based on our preclinical and clinical data, our tightly integrated and multidisciplinary team of investigators, and our bench-to-bedside-and-back research approach, we anticipate that successful completion of these studies will positively impact the development of new treatments for locally advanced PDAC patients who currently have a 5-year survival rate of ~11%. Moreover, because we will actively participate in the PDAC Consortium, the knowledge gained in these studies will be available for other studies of the immune tumor microenvironment in PDAC that are undertaken within the Consortium. Through this work, we will develop innovative approaches to enhance anti-tumor immunity in this intractable disease."
"9432736","The general aim of this proposal is to continue the successful NINDS Institutional Center Cores (P30 NS076408) at the Center for Magnetic Resonance Research (CMRR), University of Minnesota (UMN). These Cores offer state-of-the-art instrumentation, advanced technology, and unique expertise for biomedical imaging in CMRR so as to provide cutting edge resources and facilities to investigators who have existing NINDS-funded research projects serving the NINDS mission through ?basic, translational, and clinical research on the normal and diseased nervous system?. In the last two and a half decades, magnetic resonance (MR) techniques have evolved to become indispensable in studies of the brain in health and disease by providing otherwise unavailable measurement capabilities in humans and animal models. The optimal use of these techniques requires advanced instrumentation, unique expertise, and complex auxiliary capabilities such as animal surgery, large-scale data and image processing, and complementary measurements employing classical techniques (e.g., electrophysiology and histology). Access to these facilities and methodologies, especially at the cutting-edge, is virtually impossible in individual labs. The proposed NINDS Center Cores will provide and encourage access to these advanced technologies and associated unique expertise to amplify NINDS funded neuroscience research. These aims will be accomplished through three scientific Cores:  1. MR Image Acquisition and Engineering Core (to provide application specific pulse sequences,  and hardware, such as RF coils) (PI: Pierre-Francois van de Moortele; co-PI Gulin Oz)  2. MR Data Analysis and Visualization Core (to provide applications specific image and  spectroscopic analysis tools and support) (PI: Christophe Lenglet; co-PI Noam Harel)  3. Multimodality Core (to support complementary non-imaging measurement capabilities) (PI:  Geoff Ghose) The overall aim of this grant is to provide this access within the multidisciplinary, and interactive research environment of CMRR, so as to enrich the effectiveness of and promote new research directions in a large number of ongoing NINDS funded research projects."
"9434408","PROJECT SUMMARY Stroke is the most common contributor to disability in the United States (US), with over 800,000 people affected each year. In addition to treatment with intravenous recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rtPA), endovascular mechanical thrombectomy (MT) is now the standard of care for patients with a stroke due to proximal arterial occlusion. Unlike rtPA, however, MT is available at only a limited number of tertiary centers, with stringent time-dependent effect tied to viable ischemic penumbra. As a result, many patients in rural or congested areas need rapid transfer to a tertiary center capable of delivering MT while undergoing intravenous rtPA infusion by Helicopter Emergency Medical Services (HEMS). There is thus a significant unmet need to develop neuroprotective interventions that promote patient eligibility for MT after HEMS. A significant barrier to progress, however, is concern of whether current animal stroke models adequately translate the effect of neuroprotective interventions on an ischemic brain receiving rtPA during HEMS evacuation. That concern is justified by the uniqueness of the HEMS physiological environment, with multiple physical factors such as hypobaric changes, low frequency vibration, three-axis acceleration, and extreme noise. These physical factors may affect ischemic brain receiving rtPA in multiple and opposing ways, such as decreased oxygenation in the penumbra, enhanced or decreased clot lytic effect of rtPA, increased blood-brain-barrier (BBB) permeability and raised blood pressure. There is therefore a critical need to clarify and quantify the effect of these factors on neurological outcomes, in order to ensure that preclinical animal stroke models rigorously account for the unique physiological HEMS environment. The objective of this proposal is to measure the potential effect of HEMS physical factors on ischemic brain with respect to rtPA-reperfusion, infarct size and BBB permeability. We will use a novel experimental approach that combines a traditional stroke animal model with actual helicopter transport and vibration simulation. We have a multidisciplinary team of animal researchers and engineering, with access to a dedicated Mi2 helicopter that has been adapted and certified as a flying research platform. Mice/rats undergoing an embolic stroke will be randomized to receive the rtPA infusion simultaneously either in an actual helicopter flight, vibration simulator, or under ground-based conditions. Outcome measures will include measures of rtPA activity, cerebral blood flow, infarction size and hemorrhagic transformation, and BBB permeability at 48h and sensorimotor neurological outcome measures at 7 days, all of which will be correlated with helicopter-generated factors such as vibration, acceleration and altitude. We anticipate that this work will meaningfully transform the field of acute stroke care by understanding the overall effect of HEMS in the ischemic brain. This will lead to the establishment of adequate animal models to facilitate intervention research to improve the outcomes of patients during this critical early setting."
"9345832","In 2015, about 130,000 men elected to undergo radical prostatectomies (RPs). Even with nerve-sparing, incontinence and/or impotence can occur in up to 75% of cases. In our SBIR Phase I grant, we showed in vivo Proof-of-Concept of ?Nervelight,? a peripheral nerve imaging agent comprised of a Near InfraRed (NIR) dye, Dyomics 800, attached to recombinant human Nerve Growth Factor. Nervelight may spare nerves at risk in other cancer surgeries, i.e. lymph node dissection for breast cancer, or oncological parotidectomies. Hypothesis. Our scientific hypothesis is that a single dose of peripherally administered Nervelight will localize bilaterally to cavernous nerves at risk in RPs. Our commercial hypothesis is that we can translate this data into a commercial medical imaging agent to aid nerve-sparing by showing that a single dose of Nervelight: (1) can be visually detected in target nerves; (2) is safe in a GLP single dose acute toxicity study; and (3) can be produced to cGMP supporting an Investigational New Drug (IND). We will test these hypotheses in these Aims:  Aim 1.1. We will confirm effectiveness by showing bilateral localization in cavernous nerves in adult, male naïve rats after a single central injection in three pilot studies (n=90) to identify preferred injection site, route of administration (sub-cutaneous or intra-muscular), and dose. Immediately after euthanization, using the Fluobeam, we will collect a single image of neurovascular bundle from inside the incision. Using the approach established in our SBIR Phase I, we will dissect left side target nerves to assess duration of effect in large tissue samples. From right side target nerves we will confirm visual observations from Fluobeam that Nervelight has localized to target nerves by comparing two sets of contiguous sections, one set stained with nerve markers (neuronal nuclear antigen, NeuN; PGP 9.5), and the other set cryo-preserved for NIR imaging.  Aim 1.2. Using best site, route and dose from Aim 1.1, we will determine dose in naïve male adult rats (n=240) at two dose cohorts, low from Aim 1.1 and high (10X low) over eight timepoints (n=6 per timepoint group, both dose cohorts). We will analyze within- and between-group variances to statistical significance by quantifying pixels in target nerves, and will assess fluorescence in a whole body distribution study.  Aim 2. We will assess safety per Guidance, with best route from Aim 1.1 and intravenous (IV) route, in a GLP study of acute, single dose toxicity to statistical significance in rat (n=240) and dog (n=50).  Aim 3. We will complete a Chemistry, Manufacturing and Controls (CMC) Plan by developing protocols, and bioanalytics for liquid formulation GMP product into hand-filled vials for use in commercial syringes. Project Milestone. Upon funding, we will request a pre-IND meeting to review our nonclinical plan. Our Project Milestone is to complete all nonclinical work to support and open an IND for a pivotal Phase 1 safety study (n=20).

"9512137","Project Summary The large variability in lesions, impairment, and responsiveness to training following stroke has hindered the development of principled and cost-effective approaches to neuro-rehabilitation of the upper extremity. Our long-term goal is to develop predictive personalized neurorehabilitation therapy based on large data sets. This proposal is based on a unique opportunity to design and execute a large neuro-rehabilitation cohort study at a relatively low cost. Building on our established US-French collaborations, with interdisciplinary expertise in neurorehabilitation, brain imaging, dynamical systems, and statistical learning, we will predict recovery and individualize therapy with the following novel three-pronged approach. In Aim 1, we will develop a database of clinical and neural patient characteristics, treatments, and outcomes from 500 patients post-stroke receiving upper extremity rehabilitation therapy with the ARMEO Spring device (a gravity compensating exoskeleton) in routine clinical care. Inclusion criteria will be as broad as possible to include patients with a large variety of brain lesions, as assessed by state- of-the-art magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and functional MRI scans. In aim 2, using the database, we will predict long-term changes in upper extremity outcomes as a function of patient's characteristics and treatment using dynamical models that link motor learning to recovery. The final models will expand and combine previous computational models of motor learning at small time scales with models of recovery at long time scales, and will include mixed effects to accurately predict long-term recovery for individual patients. In aim 3, based on these predictions, we will perform a feasibility study aimed at individualizing upper extremity rehabilitation to maximize recovery. Given a new patient, characterized by a number of baseline characteristics that predict recovery, we will select the schedule of treatment that was the most effective for similar patients in the database. The recovery models and scheduling methods developed in this proposal will provide the basis for future clinical software that suggests timing, dosage, and content of therapy from early clinical data, kinematic performance, and routine scans. Such an approach will transform neurorehabilitation programs because the clinician, patient, and insurance company will be able to determine effective treatments while reducing costs."
"9412643","PROJECT SUMMARY Over 11 million Americans who are ?65 years have Diabetes (DM), a prototypic chronic disease requiring self- management. Up to 30% of older adults have co-occurring DM and Alzheimer's disease and related dementia (ADRD) and older people with DM may have as much as a two-fold risk of developing ADRD. Caregivers of patients with co-occurring DM-ADRD have many unmet needs, adversely affecting caregivers' ability to manage these conditions. Moreover, a lack evidence for what constitutes optimal DM management for these patients, particularly those of more advanced age (? 75 years), further compounds the challenge of managing this chronic and often comorbid disease from both the patient and medical provider perspective. With a lack of decisional guidance, primary care providers are currently ill equipped to direct care to achieve best outcomes. The goal of this research is to develop and test a quality improvement program for older patients with DM- ADRD, using a pragmatic randomized controlled trial (RCT) and mixed methods in a large, diverse healthcare system. This will feature consensus decisional guidance for the medical management of DM-ADRD patients, PCP workflow enhancements including use of a panel manager and the electronic health record (EHR) for decision support/feedback, and PCP collaborative learning. To conduct this study, ?Enhanced Quality In Primary care for Elders with Diabetes-ADRD? (EQUIPED-ADRD), we will use the R21/R33 mechanism. The R21 in the first year will develop key resources needed for the pragmatic trial, such as provider decisional guidance based on current evidence, trial design and evaluation methodology, appropriate healthcare system administrative / EHR support, and will test intervention feasibility. The R33 will implement the larger pragmatic trial in a large healthcare system through cluster randomization of the 12 largest primary care practice sites with ~60 providers and over 600 patients with diagnosed DM and ADRD. It will test hypotheses about whether care based on explicit standards for DM medical management for people with ADRD will: H1) Improve patient symptoms and quality of life while maintaining expected clinical outcomes; H2) decrease patient and caregiver management burden and improve care quality based on patient/caregiver preferences; H3) (secondary) decrease specialty, ED and hospital utilization. We will gather data from the EHR, Medicare and Medicaid insurance claims, caregiver surveys and qualitative interviews, and clinician interviews. If this clinical trial demonstrates that patients and family caregivers who receive this enhanced care quality program achieve established goals for diabetic care in addition to fewer dementia-related symptoms, less caregiver burden and stress, and fewer DM-related adverse events, potentially avoidable and costly utilization may also decrease. This best practice approach could then be widely disseminated to other clinical practices."
"9482374","PROJECT SUMMARY This is an application for a K23 award for Dr. Felicia Chow, who is establishing herself as an investigator in patient-oriented clinical research at the intersection of HIV and cerebrovascular disease. This K23 award will provide Dr. Chow with the support necessary to develop new research skills and attain practical and conceptual expertise in 4 key areas: 1) brain and vascular FDG-PET imaging, 2) mechanisms and measurement of psychological stress, 3) advanced statistical techniques for observational data, and 4) design, conduct and analysis of clinical trials. Dr. Chow has assembled an interdisciplinary team of mentors (Dr. Priscilla Hsue, an expert in the role of inflammation and endothelial dysfunction in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease in HIV; Dr. Gil Rabinovici, an expert in use of multimodal brain imaging, including novel brain PET techniques, to improve diagnosis of dementia; Dr. Elissa Epel, an expert on measurement of stress and its effects on inflammation and cardiometabolic disease; Dr. Frederick Hecht, an expert on stress and mindfulness-based interventions in HIV; Dr. Peter Bacchetti, an expert on statistical approaches to analyzing observational HIV data), who will guide her research and career development. This multi-layered mentorship structure, embedded in a highly collaborative training environment, will be critical to her development into an independent investigator, with the ultimate goal of optimizing cerebrovascular health in people living with HIV. With the evolution of HIV infection into a chronic, treatable disease, people with HIV face excess risk of several non-AIDS-related complications, including stroke. Traditional vascular risk factors (e.g., hypertension, smoking) account for only a portion of excess cerebrovascular risk in HIV. This proposal will investigate the role of psychological stress, which is highly prevalent in people with HIV, in HIV-associated cerebrovascular risk. Dr. Chow hypothesizes that psychological stress activates pro-inflammatory pathways that contribute to elevated cerebrovascular risk in HIV. She will leverage the research infrastructure of two NIH-funded studies to evaluate the association of stress with the neural inflammatory pathway (i.e., amygdala activity, immune activation, inflammatory cytokines) in Aim 1 and with cerebrovascular risk markers (i.e., carotid arterial inflammation on FDG-PET and cerebral vasoreactivity by transcranial Doppler ultrasound) in Aim 2 in a cross-section of people with well-controlled HIV. In Aim 3, she will pilot a controlled trial of a mindfulness-based stress reduction intervention in a subset of high-stress individuals with HIV to gain preliminary insight into the impact of mindfulness on the neural inflammatory pathway and on cerebrovascular risk markers. This proposal is a crucial step toward uncovering the contribution of psychological stress to cerebrovascular risk in people with HIV and developing a larger randomized controlled trial to rigorously test the effectiveness of a stress reduction intervention as an adjunctive strategy to improving cerebrovascular health in people with HIV, which will be the focus of an R01 application to be prepared and submitted before the end of the award period."
"9439613","Abstract In this National Report of Nursing Home Quality Measures and Information Technology, AHRQ will support an interdisciplinary research team who are already contributing to clinical research in long-term care settings. The PI is a doctorally-prepared RN and fellow in the American Academy of Nursing with over two decades of work in diverse projects, settings, and disciplines. Additional leadership includes experts in informatics including health information technology (IT), long term care, survey methodologies, statistics, and nursing homes have been assembled to guide this study. The research strategy includes a 4 round Delphi Technique with 30 NH IT experts to validate a NH IT Maturity survey that includes 29 content areas in resident care, clinical support, and administrative activities. Delphi experts will help also develop a NH IT maturity staging model based on NH IT capabilities, extent of IT use, and IT integration. Delphi expert opinion regarding the the NH IT Maturity scale and staging model will be combined to form a new survey that will be used to measure NH IT Maturity nationally, in the U.S. The team will conduct a pilot test of the new survey, prior to the national survey, to examine validity of the instrument. The pilot study will be conducted with 24 respondents who participated in the initial national NH IT sophistication study. These respondents will be recruited from a pool of 223 NHs participating in original research with diverse total IT sophistication measures (HIGH, MEDIUM, and LOW). Once the NH IT Maturity survey is validated, the team will conduct a three-wave, longitudinal, repeated measures study measuring NH IT Maturity in a national sample of NHs. Methods include an examination of the relationships between NH IT Maturity and stages of maturity, and nationally-reported, publicly-available NH Quality Measures available through Nursing Home Compare over three consecutive years. Specific aims are: 1) Create a NH IT maturity survey and maturity staging model using a 4 round Delphi with NH IT experts, 2) Pilot test the NH IT Maturity Survey and staging model with NH IT experts, 3) Explore NH IT maturity using the survey and staging model during a 3-year national assessment, and 4) Examine if NH IT maturity is associated with CMS quality measures in a national sample of NHs over 3 years. The project is highly innovative; national assessments of NH IT Maturity and maturity stages have not been measured previously or linked with national NH Quality Measures. This study includes a survey of NH IT Maturity in a nationally representative sample including 10% of NHs recruited from each state in the United States (N=1,570). Statistical analysis will be done using the software SAS v9 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA). Since the sampling method involves stratification by state and since the sampling weights assigned to homes will depend on the number of respondents within each state, the analysis must take the complex sampling design into account. SAS procedures such as SURVEYMEANS, SURVEYFREQ, SURVEYLOGISTIC, and SURVEYREG will be used for such analyses."
"9289245","Project Summary Accurate and efficient DNA replication is critical for the survival of all organisms. The overall goal of this project is to understand how the molecular dynamics of the processivity clamp regulate its interactions that are central to efficient DNA replication. The focus of this proposal is on the Escherichia coli beta clamp, which is a ring- shaped dimeric protein that encircles DNA and provides a binding platform for other proteins to access DNA. Processivity clamps also increase the efficiency of DNA replication by tethering DNA polymerases to DNA and increasing their processivity. Appropriate loading of the beta clamp is critical for regulation of events at the replication fork and for efficient DNA replication. Our central hypothesis, which is supported by our preliminary data, is that trapping of specific transiently sampled beta clamp conformations by the clamp loader underlies loading of beta onto DNA and determines the efficiency of this process. To test this hypothesis, in aim 1, we will design variants of the beta clamp with altered stability or asymmetry and determine the thermal stability and oligomeric state of these altered clamps. We will also probe the interactions of the altered clamps with the clamp loader. In aim 2, we will determine the dynamics of the beta clamp alone and in complex with clamp loader by Transverse Relaxation Optimized SpectroscopY (TROSY) NMR relaxation and hydrogen exchange measurements. In aim 3, we will determine the biological functions of the designed clamp protein variants, including their ability to interact with and be loaded onto DNA by the clamp loader, and to function in processive DNA replication. Correlating the dynamics of the beta clamp with its proficiency in these different activities will provide important insights into the relationship between clamp dynamics and function. Moreover, this work will provide fundamental insights into the roles of protein dynamics in regulating protein-protein interactions."

"9329104","PROJECT SUMMARY Arrhythmia-induced sudden cardiac death claims more than 250,000 lives each year in the United States. A subset of these deaths result from highly penetrant inherited arrhythmia syndromes, such as Brugada Syndrome (BrS). Loss of function variants in the voltage-gated cardiac sodium channel, SCN5A, are the major known genetic cause of BrS. Additionally, regulatory variation that affects SCN5A expression has been implicated in BrS. If BrS is diagnosed, sudden cardiac death can often be averted with an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator. Therefore the American College of Medical Genetics recommends that incidental pathogenic variants in SCN5A be reported so that patients and family members can be accurately diagnosed and treated. Unfortunately, we and others have found that the pathogenicity of SCN5A variants is often unknown or disputed and often does not accurately predict arrhythmias. Improved classification of coding and non-coding SCN5A variants as pathogenic or benign would enable more accurate diagnosis and treatment of BrS. My hypothesis is that in vitro high-throughput screening methods can accurately identify a broad set of pathogenic coding and regulatory SCN5A loss of function variants. I will pursue two specific aims to test this hypothesis: 1) Identify SCN5A coding variants that reduce channel activity and trafficking, and 2) Identify enhancers and functional non-coding SNPs affecting SCN5A expression. Under the first aim, I will survey the activity and trafficking of the 1920 possible coding variants in an important 96 amino acid region of SCN5A. My preliminary data shows proof of principle experiments that demonstrate the feasibility of mutagenesis, transgenesis, and functional assay methods necessary to complete this screen. Under the second aim, I have implemented a high-throughput sequencing-based screen to discover enhancers that affect SCN5A expression. I propose to finish this enhancer screen, then test whether SNPs that affect these enhancers' activity contribute to BrS. These studies are innovative because they leverage recently developed high-throughput sequencing-based methods to broaden and improve our understanding of variants in an important disease gene. As genomic medicine continues to become more commonplace, the challenge of interpreting patients' variants will continue to grow. This project provides a template for a general approach for improving the breadth and quality of genomic annotations to help deliver on the promise of genomic and precision medicine."
"9336327","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Over 1.2 million Americans suffer a mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) each year. The persistent physical, emotional and cognitive symptoms after mTBI significantly affect the quality of life of patients and their family members, with tremendous healthcare cost. However, the field still lacks diagnostic and prognostic tools for mTBI due to patients' negative findings in clinical imaging. Despite the progress in the investigation of neuronal and axonal injury, the neurovascular substrates of mTBI are still poorly understood. Evidence from molecular imaging suggests that mTBI causes regional disturbances in cerebral blood flow (CBF) and metabolism that account for the patients' neurocognitive and clinical symptoms. To date, the field lacks non- invasive means to assess regional brain tissue metabolism throughout the brain.  Brain injury leads to uncoupling between brain metabolic demand and actual blood supply, so assessing CBF alone does not provide insight into brain tissue metabolism. To paint a more complete picture, one needs to measure both arterial blood supply and the oxygen saturation of draining veins to determine cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (CMRO2), a key measure of brain tissue viability. For arterial blood supply measurement, we have developed methods for perfusion weighted imaging (PWI) analysis to accurately quantify absolute CBF. For venous blood oxygen saturation, we have developed a novel technique, known as susceptibility weighted imaging and mapping (SWIM), to measure the susceptibility of veins. Combining susceptibility with hematocrit, we can calculate the venous blood oxygenation.  Our objective is to identify the neurovascular substrates in mTBI that account for patients' functional and neurocognitive symptoms. We will first calibrate the SWIM quantification of blood oxygenation in an arm vein by a point-of-care blood-gas oximeter and correct its partial volume problem in small veins of the brain (specific aim 1). Then, we will translate the brain imaging technique into mTBI patients to determine the regional CMRO2 (specific aim 2). Finally, we will determine the prognostic value of regional CMRO2 for mTBI patients' 6-month outcome (specific aim 3). Using both SWIM and PWI, we propose to assess brain tissue metabolism and its prognostic value in a cohort of 30 mTBI patients, from acute to chronic stages, in comparison with 30 demographically-matched controls. We hypothesize that CMRO2 will be abnormal in mTBI patients and that the magnitude of the abnormality will account for mTBI patients' neuropsychological and functional deficits. This will be the first time use of SWIM to measure oxygen saturation in mTBI patients. The deliverable of this project will be a set of non-invasive techniques for assessing regional brain tissue metabolism after mTBI, which will help physicians identify the brain tissue at risk for secondary complications as a potential treatment target to prevent long term deficits."
"9448843","This application investigates regulation of central nervous system (CNS) angiogenesis and BBB integrity by the membrane protein Reck, a glycophosphatidylinositol (GPI)- anchored protein with large extracellular domain (ECD). In a fascinating convergence of data from many groups including ourselves, substantial overlap exists between the knockout mouse phenotypes for Reck, the G protein-coupled receptor family member Gpr124 and the Wnt7a/7b ligands. These phenotypes are all unified by marked deficits in developmental CNS angiogenesis with glomeruloid vascular malformations and forebrain-specific embryonic lethal hemorrhage. Further, Reck and Gpr124 synergistically promote canonical Wnt signaling with pronounced specificity for Wnt7a/7b and not other Wnt family members. Here, we perform mechanistic exploration of the contribution of Reck to Gpr124- and Wnt7a/7b-mediated signaling and blood-brain barrier (BBB) function. Here we investigate regulation of BBB integrity by the RECK/GPR124/Wnt pathway in vitro and in vivo. Aim 1 biochemically characterizes RECK/GPR124- regulated Wnt7a/7b signaling by defining domains of Reck and Gpr124 that underlie their physical interaction and functional promotion of Wnt7a/7b signaling. Aim 1 also investigates potential complex formation with Wnt7a/7b and the established Wnt receptors Frizzled (Fzd) and LRP. Aim 2 creates an in vitro culture model of the RECK/GPR124/Wnt pathway using primary brain endothelial cells (ECs) isolated from genetically modified mice and analyzes effects of pathway modulation on BBB marker expression and function. Aim 3 investigates the role of the RECK/GPR124/Wnt pathway in BBB integrity post-stroke using endothelial-specific and inducible knockout of Reck genetically modified mice and the tMCAO stroke model, and superimposed effects of Gpr124 knockout or Wnt pathway manipulation. Overall, these studies utilize complementary biochemical, cell biological, and genetic strategies to explore RECK/GPR124/Wnt7 regulation of Wnt/?-catenin signaling and BBB function."
"9456242","Project Summary Reward based learning can have a dramatic impact on behavior. Learning to associate particular stimuli in the environment with reward can help guide our attention to potentially rewarding outcomes. However, this can also be costly when reward associated stimuli distract us from task-relevant information. The costs of reward-driven distraction include risks to health. Reward learning has been implicated in addiction where it is thought that reward learning creates long-term persistent attention biases towards the substance of addiction and the environmental cues associated with that substance. The energy cost of resisting reward-driven behaviors, as well as the degree of fatigue, may affect the motivation to resist. It is possible that under conditions of fatigue the energy cost of resisting would be higher and thus the motivation to resist is reduced. It has even been suggested that fatigue is a ?universal risk factor? for relapse in addictions, but this hypothesis has not been tested directly, and the mechanism for the predictive relationship between fatigue and relapse has not been identified. We propose that fatigue facilitates relapse by exacerbating automatic attention capture by reward-associated cues, and that reward-driven capture is facilitated by fatigue more generally, outside the context of addiction. However, there is yet no evidence, either in humans or animal models, of how fatigue affects behaviors learned via reward. We will test three specific hypotheses: 1) Physical fatigue exacerbates persistent attention capture by formerly reward-associated visual features; 2) Physical fatigue exacerbates persistent attention capture by reward-associated visual features by impairing cognitive control; and 3) Physical fatigue uniquely exacerbates attention capture by reward-associated features. This work involves integrating two different lines of basic research from our lab, one on reward- driven attention and one on physical fatigue. We will use behavioral performance, EEG-fMRI, and cutting- edge multivariate analytical tools to elucidate the neural mechanisms of reward-driven attention that are modulated by fatigue states. The proposed work would provide evidence that physical fatigue uniquely modulates the persistent effects of reward learning on behavior, and that this effect is due to decreased cognitive control. This work would be the first to show that the state of an individual modulates reward-driven attention capture. This insight contributes to our understanding of the fundamental mechanisms for the effects of reward learning on attention, as well as to ways to mitigate the costly effects of reward-driven capture."

The age and neuroanatomical location predilections of glioma occurrence indicate important interactions between the cell of origin and its microenvironment and suggest dysregulation of mechanisms of neurodevelopment and/or plasticity. We recently showed active neurons exert a mitogenic effect on normal neural precursor and oligodendroglial precursor cells, the putative cellular origins for high-grade glioma (HGG). We now preliminarily demonstrate that active neurons similarly promote HGG proliferation in vivo using optogenetic control of cortical neuronal activity in a patient-derived pediatric glioblastoma orthotopic xenograft model. Activity-regulated mitogen(s) are secreted, as the conditioned medium from optogenetically stimulated cortical slices promoted proliferation of pediatric and adult patient-derived HGG cultures. The synaptic protein neuroligin-3 (NLGN3) was identified as the leading candidate mitogen; soluble NLGN3 was sufficient and necessary to promote robust HGG cell proliferation. NLGN3 induced PI3K pathway activity and feed-forward expression of NLGN3 in glioma cells, providing mechanistic insight into its surprising role as a mitogen. NLGN3 expression levels in human HGG negatively correlated with patient overall survival. These findings indicate the important role of active neurons in the brain tumor microenvironment and identify secreted neuroligin-3 as an unexpected mechanism promoting neuronal activity-regulated cancer growth. The proposed work aims to investigate further the direct interaction between NLNG3 and high-grade glioma cells. We will directly probe the necessity of NLGN3 in neuronal activity regulated glioma growth in an in vivo optogenetic model. Further, the research will identify mechanisms of secretion, receptor binding, and downstream signaling pathways. The proposed work highlights the previously under-recognized importance of neuronal activity in the glioma microenvironment, will result in a better mechanistic understanding of the newly identified glioma mitogen NLGN3, and may identify novel therapeutic targets to better treat these deadly brain tumors."
"9470288","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The primary aim of this proposal is to develop peptidomimetic and proteomimetic synthetic agents that can modulate protein-protein interactions (PPIs) and protein-membrane interactions (PMIs) of clinically significant targets. We will develop novel organic architectures to display amino acid side chain isosteres at a density and periodicity that mimics their biological counterparts. In particular, derivatives of the non-planar dipeptide mimetic meta-aminomethylbenzoic acid (MAMBA) will be pre-organized by directed hydrogen bond templation and evaluated as beta-sheet mimetics in linear and cyclic oligomer forms. Traditional drug discovery methods have largely failed when targets lack accessible active sites or deep ligand binding pockets. PPIs are characterized by large contact areas (often greater than 1000 angstrom^2) that confer binding strength and specificity through the sum of many weak forces. Aberrant or misregulated PPIs play a tremendous role in human disease states. Thus, small molecules and supramolecular assemblies capable of modulating PPIs present a complementary approach in drug discovery. It is estimated that over one-quarter of human proteins are membrane-associated and that membrane proteins comprise more than half of approved drug targets. Therefore, the interactions of membrane proteins with other proteins and with the cell membrane (PMIs) are of significant clinical interest. This application proposes the development of synthetic agents to study and manipulate PMIs of medically relevant targets. The oncogenic protein Ras, associated with over one-third of human cancers, is an ideal case study for synthetic compounds that target PPIs and PMIs. Ras GTPases bind their substrate nucleotides with picomolar affinity and possess scant ligand binding pockets. They have therefore been deemed ?undruggable? by traditional medicinal chemistry methods. This research proposes to develop synthetic agents targeting Ras PPIs. Because Ras is membrane-tethered by posttranslational prenylation, we will also investigate compounds that target Ras PMIs in model membrane systems. The development of synthetic regulators of PPIs and PMIs in general is of great clinical interest and the targeting of oncogenic Ras in particular is of high medical priority."
"9397435","Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is a form of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) sensitive to changes in brain white matter. In a recent publication, our group demonstrated the ability of DTI to identify areas of white matter abnormality in postdeployment Veterans in whom the only reported exposure to conditions that might injure the brain was to primary blast forces. Department of Defense (DoD) surveillance data reported 287,861 total diagnosed traumatic brain injuries (TBI) from 2000 through November, 2013, 82.5% of which were mild in severity. It is estimated that 75% of mild TBI sustained during deployment are blast-related. It is likely that many more individuals are exposed to blast during deployment but do not display symptoms consistent with mild TBI (altered level of consciousness, amnesia). Adding to the complexity of the situation, a growing body of evidence demonstrates the potential of repetitive subconcussive events to injure the brain. Most deployment- related events involve a combination of primary blast and other forces, often described as ?blast plus? or blast-related TBI. Preliminary evidence suggests that the initial effects and symptoms of blast-related mild TBI may differ from other injury mechanisms. Differences in injury mechanism(s) and/or injury evolution make it essential to determine the effects in the human brain of exposure to primary blast.  We will use multiple advanced neuroimaging techniques to better understand the effect of exposure to primary blast forces on brain structure and function, cognitive function, and symptom presentation. This study will allow us to further investigate the nature of white matter abnormalities observed in Veterans exposed to primary blast forces, providing a better understanding of the possible changes in the brain caused by this exposure. Additionally, we will be able to investigate how these changes may affect brain function by examining alterations in brain networks. We will also examine how exposure to primary blast forces may alter the individual?s ability to focus, concentrate, learn, and perform complex tasks. Finally, we will examine symptoms present following exposure to primary blast forces including anxiety, posttraumatic stress, depression, irritability, poor sleep, and overall quality of life. This study will provide a comprehensive investigation of how exposure to primary blast may affect an individual.  Results of this study may have application for both active duty service members as well as Veterans. This study will provide a better understanding of how different levels of primary blast exposure affect brain structure and function. This will improve early identification of individuals at risk for developing white matter abnormalities and allow preventative measures to be taken. Better understanding of the symptoms of exposure to primary blast has the potential to improve evaluation and diagnosis of postdeployment Veterans, thus facilitating provision of appropriate treatments and interventions. Finally, results of this study may provide insight into the chronic effects of mild TBI. Based on our previous experience, all participants will be postdeployment Veterans at least one year out of service. Therefore, changes we see during this study will not be due to the immediate effects of primary blast exposure, and will represent alterations that are not likely to resolve on their own."
"9552335","Transcriptional programming of cell identity is gaining importance at both the basic developmental and the clinical levels. While the phenomenology of cell programming and reprogramming by forced expression of transcription factors is well described, the mechanism(s) of action of programming factors or the sequence of regulatory events resulting in a cell adopting a new identity are largely unknown. We are combining the strengths of stem cell biology with genomic and computational approaches to map the process of transcriptional programming of spinal motor neuron (MN) identity at a deep molecular level. We have developed efficient methods for the induction of MN identity in differentiating embryonic stem cells (ESCs) by the expression of defined transcription factors. Using this system, we will combine biochemical, genomic, and computational analysis to address following questions: i) how is Isl1 recruited to transient enhancers in postmitotic motor neurons; ii) does Isl1 control enhancer activation; iii) are Klf/Sp factors bound to MN enhancers important for mediator and cohesin recruitment; iv) what motifs and factors coordinate interactions between distal and proximal MN- specific enhancers; v) can we infer the mechanisms controlling MN subtype specification and maturation by studying cell type and cell stage-specific regulatory regions in primary MNs. Together these studies will provide fundamental insight into the developmental processes underlying the specification of defined cell identity and will provide a novel and efficient source of MNs for disease modeling, functional analysis, and drug discovery."
"9549159","Project Summary It is well established that experience-dependent cortical plasticity is most prominent early in life, especially in the primary sensory cortices. However, distinct circuit components in the adult cortex retain their ability to undergo plasticity. For example, synapses in the superficial layers of primary sensory cortices remain plastic in adults, which contrasts thalamocortical inputs with limited plasticity. Determining the mechanisms of innate plasticity present in the adult sensory cortices will allow us to understand how the adult brain adapts to changes in sensory experience. We recently found evidence that in adult primary visual cortex (V1) select excitatory synapses undergo plastic changes with rather brief alterations in sensory experience. First, we found that brief alterations in visual experience preferentially changes the strength of lateral intracortical synapses to layer 2/3 (L2/3) neurons without changes in the strength of feedforward inputs from layer 4 (L4). Second, we found that deafening adults produces potentiation of thalamocortical synapses onto L4 neurons in V1 within a week. These findings suggest that adult V1 has rather rapid innate plasticity in response to changes in sensory experience. In this proposal, we aim to understand how specific inputs to L2/3 of adult V1 adapt to losing vision (Aim 1), and the mechanisms underlying their subsequent recovery (Aim 2). In addition, we will determine the mechanisms of thalamocortical synaptic plasticity elicited in adult V1 following a brief duration of deafening, and whether it can enhance ocular dominance plasticity (ODP) (Aim 3). The results from our work will shed light on how V1 adapts to changes in sensory experience later in life. Furthermore, our results will provide mechanistic understanding of adult V1 plasticity, and generate molecular tools to enhance or prevent such changes in a circuit specific manner. These developments will ultimately allow us to manipulate innate plasticity mechanisms present in adult V1 to promote functional recovery of vision. "
"9420764","Project Summary/Abstract With this grant application we aim to dramatically improve over the capabilities of functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) by developing a completely novel approach to measure human brain function. This is in line with the Brain Initiative FOA which aims to support early stage development of entirely new and novel noninvasive human brain imaging technologies and methods that will lead to transformative advances in our understanding of the human brain.  To substantially improve optical imaging of human brain function, we plan to develop a wearable time- gated, small-separation, diffuse correlation spectroscopy (DCS) system. We will illuminate the scalp with pulsed long-coherence lasers and detect photons with a time-gated photon counting detector positioned at a very short distance from the source. The detector will be turned on at a specific time delay with respect to the laser pulses to discard the early arriving photons, which have travelled only in the surface, and detect only photons which have travelled longer paths through the brain. Each detected photon will be time-stamped with the number of the corresponding laser pulse. Detected photons will be averaged over ~200 ms providing both intensity and temporal autocorrelation function temporal changes to quantify cerebral blood flow, oxygenation, and oxygen metabolic changes. This strategy will:  1) Move from the traditional large source-detector pair geometry with the ?banana? shaped spatial sensitivity  profile to a sub-cm source-detector separation with much improved spatial localization;  2) Improve sensitivity to brain and reduce scalp contamination by collecting only the photons that have  travelled long paths through the brain;  3) Add the measurement of cerebral blood flow to conventional fNIRS hemoglobin concentration measures;  4) Recover functional cerebral oxygen metabolism changes from the combined hemodynamic measures;  5) Cover the whole head with a dense array of small wearable optodes to produce high resolution images of  functional hemodynamic and metabolic changes that at the same time permits measurements with more  natural behaviors than presently permitted with fNIRS and other imaging methods.  In this phase we will develop the first time-gated fDCS prototype using commercially available components  and custom circuits, test the wearable optode in human subjects and determine optimal design specification  for the final system to be developed with subsequent funding mechanisms.  Once the prototype optode has been tested, the technology has been demonstrated and the best strategy for mass production has been determined, we can move to full production of low-cost time gated fDCS optodes. The development of this NIRS technology will provide an unprecedented tool to characterize brain function in humans."
"9441436","Summary/Abstract Data demonstrate that transplanted kidneys from African American (AA) deceased donors are associated with reduced survival relative to kidneys from non-AA donors. Additional data demonstrate that the presence of two APOL1 risk variants, that are found exclusively in AA individuals, have been associated with an increased risk of CKD/ESRD in the general AA population. Two risk variants of this gene have a prevalence of 13% in AAs, and may account for some or all of the increased risk of transplant loss. There are also anecdotal reports of AA living kidney donors with two APOL1 risk variants developing ESRD raising further concerns. The APOLLO study proposes to enroll all deceased and living AA kidney donors in order to definitively address the impact of APOL1 variants on kidney transplant outcomes. The Emory APOLLO Clinical Centers consortium is comprised of 12 centers distributed across the US but focused in the Southeast. In 2015 these 12 programs transplanted 219 kidneys from deceased and living AA donors accounting for about 9% of all recipients of AA kidneys, the eligible study cohort in the US. The specific aims of our consortium are: (1) to perform APOL1 genotyping on all AA deceased and living kidney donors and create a sample repository for future studies to determine whether additional genetic factors contribute to the second hit postulated to be required for risk manifestation, (2) to compare the survival and function of all transplanted kidneys from AA donors to determine the impact of two APOL1 risk variants on transplant outcomes as well as exploring the potential of environmental factors (rejection, infections, comorbid conditions such as hypertension) to provide the second hit, and 3) to study whether African American living donors who carry two copies of the variant APOL1 genes are at increased risk for chronic kidney disease. Blood samples for APOL1 genotyping of deceased donors will be provided by the organ procurement organization, while the transplant centers will provide blood for genotyping recipients and living donors (as well as deceased donors when necessary). Demographic and clinical donor and recipient data will be provided by UNOS for all subjects. More granular clinical data will be provided for patients receiving their long-term follow up from one the 12 participating transplant centers. We propose enrolling subjects for 1 year and following them for 3 years thereby maximizing the likelihood of observing clinical events. The primary outcome measure for recipients of deceased donor kidneys is graft survival with secondary outcome measures assessing a variety of indicators of renal function and injury. As advance CKD or ESRD following living kidney donation are highly unlikely events, given the relatively short study duration the primary outcome for living kidney donors will be the change in renal function from the post-transplant baseline to the end of follow up at 3 years post-donation. When combined with the data from the other 14 APOLLO Clinical Center Consortia, we believe our data will contribute to a much more complete understanding of the impact of APOL1 gene variants on the outcomes of kidney transplantation and donation."

"9470260","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal leverages and extends the MOBILIZE Boston Study (MBS), which previously demonstrated significant relationships between abnormal cerebral blood flow (CBF) regulation, slow gait speed, and the development of falls in a representative population of elderly people living in the Boston metropolitan area. Our findings have led to the hypothesis that alterations in CBF regulation are associated with microvascular damage to periventricular and subcortical white matter in the brain, which ultimately results in slowing of gait, executive dysfunction, and falls. We also hypothesize that those individuals who can redistribute blood flow to healthy cortical networks during cognitive or motor tasks can prevent slowing of gait and falls, despite the presence of white matter damage. The current proposal will add rigorous transcranial Doppler and neuroimaging (structural, diffusion tensor, and functional MRI) measures to the third assessment of 250 MBS participants to determine whether: 1) reduced CBF in response to a cognitive or motor task (neurovascular coupling), is longitudinally associated with the slowing of gait speed, executive dysfunction, functional decline, and recurrent falls over 2 years of followup; 2) abnormalities in CBF regulation, including CO2 vasoreactivity and neurovascular coupling, are associated with loss of white and gray matter microstructural integrity on MRI and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI); 3) these structural changes in the brain are associated with slowing of gait, executive dysfunction, functional decline, and recurrent falls over 2 years; and 4) the brain's ability to increase blood flow to healthy regions during cognitive or motor tasks can attenuate the adverse effects of white or gray matter microstructural damage on functional decline and falls. The study is unique in focusing on alterations in CBF as a pathological mechanism of falls, developing cutting-edge MR imaging techniques to detect early microstructural markers of brain damage that can predict falls, and identifying a compensatory mechanism that protects some people from the effects of this damage on falls - all in a large representative elderly cohort. Our successful 7-year retentio and followup of the MBS cohort and collaboration with the Boston VA Neuroimaging Center will help assure we achieve our goals. Relevance: This study will provide novel information necessary for the early detection and ultimate prevention of cerebrovascular causes of falls and mobility impairments in elderly people. If abnormal brain blood flow is discovered to be a cause of falls, currently available interventions to increase brain blood flow, prevent cerebrovascular damage, grow new blood vessels, or build new neural pathways may prevent future falls."
"9443876","Effects of PFBS exposure on adverse pregnancy outcomes and fetal development. Perfluorobutane sulfonate (PFBS) is a new chemical widely used in industrial and household products and its persistence, bioaccumulation and toxic properties has been reported. The scientific aims of this proposal are based on the toxicity of PFBS and our preliminary findings that exposure to PFBS can lead to pregnancy- induced hypertension (PIH) and altered maternal and fetal thyroid hormone levels in a Shanghai Birth Cohort (SBC) led by my primary mentor, Dr. Jun Jim Zhang. The prevalence of PIH (~10%) is high in China and PIH- related complications are still threatening maternal and fetal life and health worldwide due to the lack of efficient therapeutic methods. Epidemiology studies have pointed to a thyroid-related disease outbreak in China, especially women are at higher risk of developing hypothyroidism (~17%). Proper thyroid hormone levels are critical for fetal growth and maintaining pregnancy. Environmental exposures including PFBS can contribute to these adverse outcomes. Therefore, the major aim of this proposal is to investigate the effect of maternal exposure to PFBS on the risk of PIH and maternal and cord blood levels of thyroid hormones in Shanghai. We also propose to investigate the underline mechanisms of these findings. A key innovation is that we will answer critical and novel epidemiological and biological research questions. The molecular biology assays for studying mechanisms are innovative, especially the genome-wide chromatin accessibility which is a novel and the most advanced approach to study epigenetics. Successful completion of these aims builds on my expertise (strong molecular biology training and research experiences in maternal fetal medicine) and extends it to exposure assessment and reproductive and perinatal epidemiology in a global research setting that requires additional training and mentorship. I will attain the necessary expertise by working with experts in the relevant fields, through formal course work, structured mentored training and laboratory work. This project will take advantage of the available infrastructure in Shanghai through the highly respected LMIC research institution that will enable me to establish a pregnancy cohort of 6,500-10,000 women and follow the newborns up to two years at a cost effective efficient manner. This grant, beyond providing the necessary training to me to be established as an independent international researcher, will address important gaps in evidence on the effects of PFBS exposure on maternal and child health, and will provide a resource for future studies."
"9430869","PROJECT SUMMARY Stroke causes significant disability, and recovery is often incomplete. In animal models of stroke, robust upper extremity (UE) motor recovery can be elicited if high doses of functional training are given early. In humans, however, the optimal training dose is unknown, because no quantitative dose-response trials have been undertaken in the first months after stroke. This deficiency stems from a lack of measurement instruments that can accurately and easily quantify UE functional training dose and recovery. To address this gap, this proposal will generate two new measurement tools to enable quantitative stroke recovery research. The first tool (Aim 1) will quantify the number of functional movements made during stroke rehabilitation, measuring UE training dose. The second tool (Aim 2) will quantify the abnormality of movements, measuring UE recovery and response to interventions. We will combine wireless motion capture and computational methodologies to create objective, precise, and user-friendly tools. Inertial measurement units, worn by individuals with stroke and healthy controls performing various activities, will capture upper body motion. In Aim 1, machine learning algorithms will be trained to identify and count functional movements in activities normally practiced during rehabilitation. In Aim 2, functional principal components analysis will quantify movement impairment and compensation in standardized motions. Validity will be determined by correlating tool outcomes with current gold standards. The proposed study will be conducted at New York University, in collaboration with investigators from the NYU Center for Data Science, Columbia University, and Washington University-St. Louis. Each have complementary expertise in machine learning, functional data analysis, and functional movement identification. This K02 Independent Scientist Award will provide the candidate with skill in advanced motion capture and analytical methodologies needed to study stroke rehabilitation and recovery. The career development plan includes personalized tutorials and coursework combined with longitudinal oversight of data analysis, providing an excellent foundation for launching an independent research career. Ultimately, the developed tools have the potential to immediately impact neurorehabilitation research, facilitating the rigorous dose-response trials so critically needed to change clinical practice and improve stroke outcomes."
"9418972","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Hispanics/Latinos (H/L) are more likely to be diagnosed with cancer at later stages than non-Hispanics, due to barriers associated with knowledge, access to care, and language. Further, the American Cancer Society estimates more than half of all cancer deaths could be prevented by making healthy behavior choices (completing appropriate cancer screening tests, maintaining a healthy weight, eating a balanced diet, engaging in regular physical activity, using sun protection, limiting alcohol consumption, and abstaining from tobacco). However, there is a lack of Spanish-language cancer education and prevention resources that have been culturally and contextually created for this audience. Additionally, H/L populations often tend to be viewed as one aggregate demographic group, when, in fact, there are sub-ethnicities within this population that have unique cultural and psychographic characteristics. Attending to these specific characteristics in the design and promotion of cancer prevention education may improve H/L health and represents a form of preference-based precision medicine/communication.  Results from our team?s previous work and the work of others indicate effective communication, leading to increased knowledge and behavior change can occur in multiple forms. Recent studies report community- focused, preference-based, culturally adapted programs have been successful in increasing cancer-screening behaviors in H/L. We propose to build on our foundation of community-focused educational activities established during the previous funding periods and expand our goals to: reach rural areas in Puerto Rico (PR) and areas heavily populated by PRs in Florida (FL) through tailored education and the conduct of our ¡Salud! serie de charlas in PR (a series of interactive community meetings, previously held only in FL), and conduct the community/researcher forum El Puente (The Bridge) in FL (previously held only in PR), and expand our use of social media and new technologies for measuring impacts of our efforts. In addition, we propose using the culturally-adapted Spanish version of ?Cancer 101: A Cancer Education and Training Program for Hispanics/Latinos - Version 2? (Cancer 101) as a ?train-the-trainer? curriculum to address the identified cancer- related educational needs of H/L. This adapted curriculum serves two goals: 1) it delivers culturally-tailored cancer information to H/L community members and 2) it trains a new cadre of public health students to assist the Outreach Core (OC) in disseminating cancer information. Our activities are designed to increase awareness of cancer prevention, early detection, treatment programs, and cancer research for H/L in FL, and PR. Our efforts are bolstered by the Community Health Educator (CHE) and our Community Advisory Panels (CAPs) to strengthen and sustain community partnerships/collaborative activities with key academic, community, and regional partners at both sites, and to assist with recruitment and retention of H/Ls into partnership projects, such as the PR Biobank and the Community Participant Registry."
"9402504","ABSTRACT Crohn?s disease and ulcerative colitis, the two major forms of idiopathic inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), are chronic disorders of the gastrointestinal tract affecting ~3.7 million Americans and Europeans, and several hundred thousand more worldwide. Intensive searches for genetic risk factors, including genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and follow-up studies by the NIDDK Inflammatory Bowel Disease Genetics Consortium and the International Inflammatory Bowel Disease Genetics Consortium have yielded significant evidence for association between IBD and >240 genetic loci, and have illuminated biological pathways such as the IL-23/T helper 17 (Th17) immune pathway, autophagy, mucosal barrier function, and immune activation of multiple integrin genes in IBD pathogenesis. While fine genetic association mapping efforts have resolved 51 association signals to a single genetic variant with >50% probability of being causal, the remaining known IBD loci have yet to be fine mapped. Access to large patient sample sizes and the multidisciplinary team science that a consortium facilitates are crucial for the momentum in dissecting the genetics of IBD to continue, and for bridging the gaps between genetic associations, mechanistic understanding, and improved therapies. Thus, in Aim 1 of this competitive renewal application we propose to continue our participation in IBDGC research efforts, and we propose specific consortium-wide projects for consideration by the Steering Committee. A major challenge in moving from genetic associations to mechanistic understanding is the fact that SNP(s) with the strongest association signal(s) in most established IBD loci lie in non-coding regions, where our knowledge of the functional effects of DNA variation pales in contrast to our understanding of the genetic code for amino acids in protein-coding regions. Additionally, genetic studies alone cannot distinguish causal variants from neighboring non-causal variants in linkage disequilibrium for many known IBD association signals. Fortunately, recent studies suggest a way forward. Comparing the locations of non-coding, disease-associated SNPs with chromatin maps in specific cell types and stimulation conditions can prioritize candidate non-coding DNA variants, specific cell types and contexts for follow-up functional studies. In Aim 2, we will define the molecular effects of IBD-associated, non-coding, accessible chromatin region DNA variation on primary human CD4+CD45RO+CD196(CCR6)+ T cell (a subset including both Th17 and T regulatory [Treg] cells) functional responses to specific stimulation conditions. This work will build on our mapping of accessible chromatin regions in CD4+CD45RO+CD196+ T cells stimulated under two specific conditions, our identification of overlap between these accessible chromatin regions and SNPs in the credible set for each fine mapped IBD locus that is >95% likely to contain the causal variant, and our preliminary integration of chromatin accessibility, RNA-seq and genotype data in the same samples. CRISPR/cas9 genome editing in primary human T cells will be utilized to test the functional effects of accessible chromatin regions harboring IBD-associated SNPs."
"9570399","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Louisiana State University and the Health Sciences Centers in New Orleans and Shreveport have formed an interdisciplinary collaboration to perform research on the environmental and health impacts of pollutant-particle systems associated with Superfund sites. Our researchers have discovered chlorinated aromatic hydrocarbons and substituted phenols chemisorb to the surfaces of particulate matter containing redoxactive transition metals where they reduce the metal and form a free radical. These radicals are stabilized by association with surface, and their reactivity is reduced to the point that they can persist in the atmosphere for several days. Our biomedical researchers have shown these environmentally persistent free radicals (EPFRs) associated with ultrafine particulate matter are also persistent in biological media where they initiate long catalytic chain cycles resulting in production of >1000 hydroxyl radicals per EPFR. This promotes oxidative stress leading to induction of pulmonary and cardiac dysfunction as well as altering the expression of P450 enzyme. The EPFRs have been detected in contaminated soils at a Superfund wood-treating site and the fly-ash produced from incineration of hazardous substances. At high concentrations in thermal treatment devices, the EPFRs also promote the formation of new molecular pollutants, such as polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans (PCDD/F). Our center includes 3 non-biomedical projects studying the mechanism of EPFR and PCDD/F formation in thermal treatment systems, formation and fate of EPFRs in Superfund soils, and the properties of fine and ultrafine particles promoting EPFR formation. Three biomedical projects research the effects of EPFRs on oxidative stress-induced cardiac dysfunction, pulmonary dysfunction, and expression of P450. These projects are supported by 3 research cores: a Materials Core to synthesize and characterize particles to test specific research hypotheses, an Oxidative Stress Core to assess generation of ROS and oxidative stress, and a Computational Core to calculate the properties of EPFR-particle systems as a function of particle size. The program also includes, an Administrative Core, Research Translation Core, Community Outreach Core, and Training Core."
"9356489","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite significant strides in patient safety, significant gaps remain. Across the board, evidence-based practices have not been consistently implemented. Ambulatory settings remain understudied and lack safety infrastructure and systems. These issues are particularly acute in safety-net health care settings which disproportionately care for low-income, diverse, and vulnerable populations. Therefore, we propose to create a transdisciplinary patient safety learning laboratory, the San Francisco Ambulatory Safety CEnter for INnovaTion (ASCENT). We aim to bring together design thinking, reliability science, health system innovation and safety research to design and iterate technical and workflow solutions for high-priority ambulatory safety issues. Promising innovations will be implemented and evaluated in the San Francisco Health Network using implementation sciences methodology to assess reach, effectiveness, adoption, implementation, and maintenance. We plan to partner with closely affiliated safety-net innovation networks to disseminate and share successful innovations among safety-net health systems. ASCENT will focus on the following three high-priority ambulatory safety issues: (1) test result management: when patients' diagnostic test results are not acted upon in a timely fashion, diagnostic delays and failures often ensue; (2) monitoring for high-risk sub-populations: failures of monitoring for patients receiving high-risk treatments (such as anticoagulation or immunosuppression) can lead to adverse events. Use of team-based work-flow and electronic registry tools, de-coupled from visits has potential to enhance monitoring practices for high-risk patients; (3) medication comprehension: patient medication self-administration has been implicated in outpatient ADEs, and validated methods to enhance comprehension have not been implemented systematically.

"9278042","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Project 3 ? Aging and Health in India: A Longitudinal Study and an Experimental Platform Throughout the world, the elderly share of the population is projected to increase dramatically over the next several decades. This change is expected to be particularly dramatic in India, as the population of individuals 60 years and older is expected to climb from 8.9 percent in 2015 to 19.4 percent in 2050. In India, as elsewhere, this significant demographic shift will pose a new set of health and welfare challenges, particularly: (1) an increased prevalence of non-communicable diseases, such as diabetes and hypertension, (2) a change in family structures and support systems that leave the elderly population increasingly living alone and supporting themselves, and (3) a reduction in financial security due to numerous factors including (1) and (2). Policy-makers and governments need more data on the health and wellbeing trends within the elderly population in order to make effective policy decisions. In the proposal, we highlight how we plan to leverage the unique partnership between J-PAL South Asia and the government of Tamil Nadu to conduct a large, high- quality panel health survey of the elderly within the state that is modeled on the HRS and the WHO's SAGE. We will work closely with the government of Tamil Nadu to advise and oversee all aspects of the design and implementation of the survey; however, the government will fully fund and conduct the surveys themselves. The data collected will be immediately useful for the government of Tamil Nadu to better understand the needs of its aging population in order to create evidence-based policy, but it will also provide us with a unique opportunity to build capacity and to field a set of research experiments that can inform a wide set of policies. Evidence regarding interventions that work to improve the health and wellbeing of the elderly is strikingly sparse. We propose using the longitudinal panel as a platform for researchers, including ourselves, to conduct randomized evaluations on a subset of the sample. Here, we propose two specific interventions: (1) home visits for the elderly to assess health and wellbeing, and (2) application support for the old age pension program. Both interventions will contribute significantly to the literature and are easily scalable. We are unaware of any interventions using regular home visits to the elderly in the context of a developing country. Furthermore, evaluations of home visits to the elderly in developed countries have had mixed results. While there is some evidence regarding the impact of non-contributory pensions, this research has been largely non- experimental. Our intervention would thus be the first experimental study on the impact of obtaining a pension on the health and cognition of the elderly, and could contribute to a broader understanding of the tools available to support the health of aging populations."
"9395309","PROJECT SUMMARY: Complications resulting from rupture of unstable atherosclerotic lesions, including myocardial infarction and stroke, are the leading cause of death worldwide. Despite decades of research, the mechanisms and factors leading to plaque rupture remain poorly understood. It is generally accepted that lesions with a high smooth muscle cell (SMC) to macrophage (M?) ratio are less likely to rupture. However in the setting of atherosclerosis, SMC down-regulate their characteristic markers and express markers of other cells types and thus are undetectable using traditional markers. Indeed, rigorous SMC lineage tracing studies by our lab using Myh11 ERT2Cre eYFP ApoE-/- mice have shown that >80% of SMC within lesions lack expression of the markers previously used for their identification and that nearly 30% of these cells have activated multiple markers of M?. Therefore, the number of SMC within lesions has not only been grossly underestimated, but many cells thought to be M? are actually SMC-derived. Of even greater significance, we showed that SMC-specific conditional knockout of the stem cell pluripotency genes Klf4 and Oct4 had a profound impact on the pathogenesis of lesions including alterations in multiple indices of plaque stability. However, contrary to the dogma that SMC are always atheroprotective, we showed they can be either atheroprotective or -promoting depending on the nature of their phenotypic transitions. Taken together, studies highlight the importance of identifying factors and mechanisms that promote beneficial changes in SMC phenotype.  An ongoing clinical trial is investigating neutralization of interleukin-1? in high-risk cardiovascular patients. The overarching hypothesis is that inflammation drives atherosclerosis, and that inhibition of inflammation will improve patient survival. However, there is a lack of preclinical evidence that neutralization of IL1? will confer beneficial effects in the setting of advanced atherosclerosis. Indeed, recent studies from our lab, which included the applicant, showed that treatment of our Myh11 ERT2Cre eYFP ApoE-/- mice with the Novartis IL1?-neutralizing antibody after the establishment of advanced atherosclerosis resulted in multiple changes consistent with reduced plaque stability including marked reductions in the number of SMC-derived eYFP+ cells within the fibrous cap, and replacement of these cells with M?. Studies in this proposal will test the hypothesis that IL1? signaling in SMC is critical for maintenance of plaque stability in late-stage atherosclerosis. Aim 1 test the hypothesis that the detrimental effects of anti-IL1? Ab treatment on late-stage atherosclerosis are primarily mediated through IL1R1 signaling in SMC and that this results in deleterious phenotypic transitions in lesion SMC. Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that increased production of interleukin-4 (IL4) following anti-IL1? Ab treatment of Myh11 ERT2Cre eYFP ApoE-/- mice with advanced lesions contributes to the deleterious effects of anti-IL1? Ab treatment on late-stage lesion pathogenesis observed in our initial studies. These studies will greatly increase our understanding of IL1? signaling in late-stage atherosclerosis and may identify approaches to augment current therapies to promote atheroprotective changes in SMC phenotypes and ultimately improve patient outcomes."
