"9315738","Project Summary / Abstract: Therapeutic Development Program (TDP)  The scientific goal of the Therapeutic Development Program (TDP) of the University of Arizona Cancer Center  (UACC) is to develop strategies that can be used to expand available therapeutic options and / or lead to  enhanced efficacy of existing therapeutics. The Program leverages internal basic research expertise in the  study of molecular pathways that mediate cancer growth, including specialized capabilities in target discovery,  molecular modeling, and chemical synthesis with analogue development, refinement of novel molecule-based  therapeutics, and extensive analysis of predictive biomarkers. Program activities are organized under three  major themes: 1) Chemically synthesize and biologically characterize novel anti-cancer agents, 2) Elucidate  unique biologic targets for new chemotherapy agents, and 3) Translate laboratory findings into clinical trials. In  the past 6 years, the Program has initiated and participated in 36 interventional trials. Currently, 19  interventional investigator-initiated trials (IITs) are open and recruiting patients at the UACC. The capabilities of  the TDP have been expanded greatly by the recent expansion of the UACC-affiliated clinical facilities, the  strategic recruitment of 13 clinicians and researchers, and its inclusive training and mentoring environment.  The TDP Members lead and participate in the UACC Disease-Oriented Teams, which have promoted  collaborations within TDP and with the three other UACC Research Programs. The Members focus on targets  and precision medicine approaches of potential relevance to clinical cancer applications with an emphasis on  the cancer burden in the catchment area, including skin, breast, lymphoma, and gastrointestinal cancers. TDP  Members have published 547 cancer-relevant manuscripts, of which 19% are intra-programmatic and 24%  inter-programmatic. The significance of the Program is indicated by publication in very high impact journals (4  NEJM, 3 Nature, 1 Nature Genetics, 4 PNAS, 2 Lancet, 4 Lancet Oncology, and 1 J Invest Dermatol); its entry  of 3 new first-in-the-field drugs into Phase II studies and commercial development; and its introduction of  several new diagnostic/prognostic technologies into national validation trials, one of which is now marketed.  Currently, the Program has 53 Members representing 19 different departments. As of September 1, 2015, the  TDP Program secured $8.3M in total annual grant dollars with $2.6M of that from the NCI and $4.2M in other  peer-reviewed funding."
"9444853","PROJECT 2 SUMMARY ABSTRACT  Multiple myeloma (MM) is a slowly proliferating tumor of post-germinal center plasma cells that causes bone  destruction, marrow failure, immuneparesis and renal failure and results in over ten thousand deaths each year  in the USA. For many years a class of drugs termed immunomodulatory drugs (IMiDs) have been used in the  clinic with remarkable activity against MM and a few other hematopoietic neoplasms (Chronic Lymphocytic  Leukemia, NonHodgkin Lymphoma and Myelodysplastic Syndrome with 5q- deletion). Although many patients  have a favorable initial IMiD response, most will eventually relapse with loss of sensitivity to the IMiD (acquired  resistance to IMiDs). Patients also differ in their initial responses to IMiD therapy. While some enjoy  `exceptional' responses to IMiD treatment (defined as time to progression of 72 months or longer) others  exhibit innate resistance and thus never respond. The exact mechanism of IMiD action and resistance in MM  remains elusive, although it is clear that IMiDs trigger the CRBN-dependent degradation of the hematopoietic  transcription factor Ikaros. Almost every MM tumor is characterized by super enhancer-mediated oncogene  dysregulation via insertion of such enhancers into the MYC locus or via recurrent IgH enhancer translocations  to a number of oncogenes. Our preliminary data further indicate that many these critical super-enhancers  driving oncogene expression in MM exhibit high Ikaros occupancy, and that their enhancer function is  consequently often Ikaros-dependent. Our hypothesis is that tumor cell-autonomous IMiD resistance is caused  by super-enhancers driving oncogene expression that retain their function in the presence of IMiDs. The work  presented here studies IMiD resistance using three different approaches. First, with the goal of identifying  genetic determinants of innate and acquired IMiD resistance, we will examine structural variations (primarily  DNA translocations) that mobilize super-enhancers to oncogenes in patient samples that have been banked in  the Mayo Clinic biobank. Secondly, we have >80 genetically annotated MM cell lines with a range of responses  to IMiDs that will be tested for their response to IMiDs in terms of proliferation and changes in gene  expression/protein levels (including MYC). Additionally we will examine synergies between IMiDs and a  number of novel rational drug partners including next generation BET inhibitors (BETi), CBP/p300 inhibitor and  a combination BETi/p300 inhibitor. Thirdly, IMiD response mediated by the inter-play between tumor cell and  host will be studied in an orthotopic, immunocompetent humanized mouse model of MM in which both the  tumor and the host are capable of responding to IMiDs. Our ultimate goal is to rationally optimize the activity of  IMiDs, which would have a profound impact on the clinical history of MM, both avoiding IMiD resistance in  newly diagnosed patients and reversing IMiD resistance in relapsed patients."
"9576633","The generation of original analytical data for foods at the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) is conducted through the National Food and Nutrient Analysis Program (NFNAP) in collaboration with multiple groups including the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and other federal agencies. NFNAP includes statistically based sampling plans for Key Foods, and analysis of foods by qualified laboratories. The four Specific Aims of the NFNAP are to: 1) identify major contributors of nutrients and other compounds identified by the sponsoring IC. Key Foods are frequently consumed foods and ingredients, which contributed, collectively, more than 75% of the intake of any specific nutrient for the U.S. population; 2) assess existing data quality for those identified contributors; 3) develop high quality, statistically-based nationwide sampling plans including high priority foods consumed by U.S. ethnic subpopulations using scientifically appropriate validated methodologies for rigorous quality control; and 4) develop validated databases as needed to disseminate nationally representative estimates for means and variability for foods and bioactive food components in dietary supplements. Analytical data generated through the NFNAP are compiled and released in annual updates of the USDA National Nutrient Database for Standard Reference (SR). They are also used to calculate estimates for related foods not analyzed, to assess nutrient variability, and to evaluate methods for estimating the nutrient content of multi-ingredient foods. These data will be used by the Food Surveys Research Group (FSRG), Agricultural Research Service (ARS) to develop the Food and Nutrient Dataset for Dietary Surveys used in the ?What We Eat in America? (WWEIA) component of NHANES. Additionally these USDA generated data form the major underpinnings of all nutrient analysis programs used in U.S. clinical care and  nutrition research settings, as well as other Federal nutrition programs."

"9577870","The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) is a program of studies designed to assess the health and nutritional status of adults and children in the United States, and to assess changes over time. The survey is unique in that it combines interviews, physical examinations, and laboratory analysis of biological specimens.  Laboratory data are obtained by analysis of blood and urine samples collected from survey participants at NHANES Mobile Examination Centers. Health status is assessed by physical examination. Demographic and other survey data regarding health status, nutrition, and health-related behaviors are collected by in-person interviews.  NHANES findings are used to determine the prevalence of diseases, risk factors for diseases, and health disparities. The NHANES sample is designed to be nationally representative, so that NHANES findings can be used as the basis for national standards for height, weight, blood pressure, and children?s growth charts. In addition, NHANES data are used in epidemiological studies, for development of public health policy, to design health programs, and to guide future research. Data are released in two-year cycles and are publicly available on the NCHS website.  The oral health component of NHANES is supported jointly by CDC Division of Oral Health and NIDCR.  During various two-year data-gathering cycles it may include a caries and tooth loss examination, periodontal disease assessment, and fluorosis examination; as well as a set of interview questions regarding oral health quality of life measures.  Examinations are performed by dentist-examiners who have been trained in standardized methods to ensure validity, and calibrated against a standard examiner for consistency."

"9446711","Project Summary/Abstract: Research Project 2  The KRAS oncogene is mutated in ~95% of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas (PDAC). Mutated Kras  oncoproteins are locked in a constitutively active, GTP-bound state that activates multiple effector signaling  cascades leading to PDAC initiation, maintenance, and progression. Strategies of directly targeting KRas have  not been successful over the last three decades, so inhibition of KRas effector signaling pathways appears to  be the most promising direction at the moment for advancement to the clinic. In particular, considerable efforts  and interests are now focused on inhibitors of the Raf-MEK-ERK mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)  cascade. However, Raf and MEK inhibitors have shown limited activity in RAS-mutant cancers, largely owing  to the rapid emergence of the escape mechanism of ERK reactivation. These findings have prompted the  development of ERK inhibitors. Among them, BVD-523, a small molecule that targets ERK1 and ERK2 in the  sub-nanomolar range, is the leading compound entering oncology clinical trials. PDXs are the most clinically-  relevant model for testing the efficacy of BVD-523 and identifying potential intrinsic (i.e cell-autonomous) and  extrinsic (i.e tumor microenvironmental) resistance mechanisms that can be exploited for development of more  potent combinatorial regimens. Our Research Project 2 aims at testing the efficacy of BVD-523 using our  extensive repository of 105, clinically-annotated PDAC patient-derived xenografts (PDX). In our proposal, we  plan to develop effective ERK inhibitor-based therapies in conjunction with predictive biomarkers by leveraging  our extensive repertoire of PDXs, which can be rapidly advanced into clinical trials. To achieve this objective,  we propose the following three aims: 1) undertake proteogenomic and functional characterization of PDXs of  pancreatic cancer, 2) test combination approaches that overcome tumor-intrinsic ERK inhibition resistance  mechanisms, and 3) develop therapeutic combination approaches that overcome tumor-extrinsic ERK  inhibition resistance mechanisms. Our goal is to identify combinations that can be quickly advanced into  clinical trials in pancreatic cancer and predictive biomarkers that can be used to enrich patients population for  the study."
"9315740","Project Summary / Abstract: Cancer Biology Program (CBP)  The goal of the Cancer Biology Program (CBP) is to identify etiologic mechanisms underlying cancer  development and progression. As the main basic science of cancer platform for the University of Arizona  Cancer Center, the Cancer Biology Program seeks to advance fundamental knowledge of the complex  biological networks that are deranged in cancer and to characterize interactions between these complex  biological networks and the environment that promote carcinogenesis and tumor progression. Translation of  current findings and development of novel approaches to cancer prevention and treatment is facilitated through  inter-programmatic collaborations and Cancer Center support. The program is organized into three major  themes, including Genomic Instability and Epigenetic Control of Gene Expression, Signaling Networks in  Carcinogenesis and Tumor Progression, and Invasion and Metastasis, with four aims: (i) to investigate  mechanisms of cancer initiation and progression and to characterize cellular mechanisms that control cancer  metastasis, (ii) to identify networks and regulatory pathways as potential markers or targets in prevention and  treatment, (iii) to promote intra- and inter-programmatic collaborations to enhance translational research along  the continuum from pre-clinical mouse models and human tissue correlates to clinical trials, and (iv) to foster  research directions of particular relevance to individuals in Arizona and the Southwest. The Cancer Biology  Program achieves these aims through establishment of working groups, conferences and seminars, and  development of inter-disciplinary scientific teams; faculty recruitment, membership development and  mentoring, and the use of developmental funds to spur targeted research; and, guidance and support of the  shared resources. The CBP has 49 Members representing 21 different departments at the University of  Arizona. CBP Members have published 390 cancer-relevant manuscripts, of which 30% were intra-  programmatic and 36% were inter-programmatic. As of September 1, 2015, the CBP Program secured $11.8M  total annual grant dollars with $2.5M from the NCI and $8.3M in other peer-reviewed funding.

"9446710","Project Summary/Abstract: Research Project 1  Summary  Research project 1 focuses on identifying response predictors and resistance mechanisms for  phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)  inhibitors through the conduct of a PDX trial using a broad selection of  breast cancer models of hormone receptor positive (HR+)/HER2- and triple negative breast cancer (TNBC)  subtypes. PI3K inhibitors are attractive therapeutic agents for breast cancer because of the frequent occurrence  of PIK3CA mutations in hormone receptor positive (HR+) and PTEN loss in TNBC. However single agent PI3K  inhibitors have yielded only modest anti-tumor activity and the efficacy of pan-PI3K inhibitors are often limited by  dose limiting toxicities in clinical trials. Isoform-specific PI3K inhibitors are therefore of great interest to maximize  target inhibition with improved tolerability.A major challenge in the development of PI3K inhibitors have been  the identification of patients who may benefit the most from these agents and for whom isoform specific inhibitors  are appropriate. Clinical trials have focused on limited markers including PIK3CA mutation and PTEN status,  which do not consistently predict response. In-depth biomarker research is needed, but is often difficult in the  clinical trial setting due to the quantity and quality of the study material and the inability to obtain serial tumor  biopsies from patients. In contrast, patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models provide nearly unlimited tumor  resources for pre- and post-treatment in-depth genoproteomic analysis for biomarker development and  determination of resistance mechanisms for rational drug combinations. We hypothesize that a breast cancer  PDX trial of pan- and isoform-specific PI3K inhibitors, will discern isoform dependency of individual tumors to  derive predictive biomarkers. We will use copanlisib, a potent pan-PI3K inhibitor with activity against  predominantly PI3K? versus PI3K?, and AZD8186, a specific PI3K? inhibitor, both agents are in the NCI-IND  portfolio. In addition, based on literature evidence and our preliminary data from a PDX trial of buparlisib, we  hypothesize that adding the MEK inhibitor selumetinib, also an NCI IND agent, will improve response to  copanlisib and/or AZD8186 based on literature evidence and the synergistic anti-tumor effects we observed  when combining a pan-PI3K inhibitor with a MEK inhibitor in our PDX models of breast cancer.  Aim 1 will conduct the PDX trial. 100 breast cancer PDX models comprised of ER+HER2- and TNBC subtypes  available from the PDX core will be selected based on passage number, genomic stability and tumor  characteristics. To enrich for the target population, at least 30 PDX models with PIK3CA mutation and at least  30 PDX models with PTEN null phenotype will be included in this PDX trial. Each PDX model will be passaged  to 12 immune-deficient mice and randomly assigned to 6 treatment groups (n=2 each treatment group) to receive  either vehicle, copanlisib, AZD8186, selumatinib, copanlisib + selumetinib or AZD8186 + selumetinib. Several  tumor response criteria will be used for classification of sensitive vs resistant to drug(s) therapy. These include  the recently published mRECIST criteria and the traditional % tumor growth inhibition which includes a vehicle  treated group. Aim 2 will identify candidate and novel genoproteomic predictors of response for each single agent  or combination therapy by analyzing global genomic data (whole exome and RNA Seq) and proteomic data  generated by multi-kinase inhibitor bead mass spectrometry (MIB-MS) for unbiased discovery of candidate  biomarkers. The analysis will include a focus on identifying outlying, differentially expressed biomarkers between  sensitive and resistant tumors. Aim 3 will perform kinome profiling (MIB-MS) of post treatment samples to assess  drug-induced signaling changes in order to discern mechanisms of action of the study treatments and to identify  intrinsic and treatment-induced adaptive survival mechanisms.  This project will be supported by the infrastructure established by the WU-PDTC for data collection, including  drug treatment, mice tolerability and tumor volumes changes over time. In addition, the bioinformatics capability  provided by the WU-PDTC for trial interpretation and genoproteomic analysis will be leveraged to derive  predictors of response and resistance mechanisms to PI3K inhibitors. In addition, team members of Project 1  will interact regularly with team members of Project 2 for information exchange to improve research approach  and results sharing. The long term goal of this research is to set up a standardized PDX trial platform to identify  promising drug(s) and biomarker pairs for clinical testing."

"9444854","PROJECT 3 ABSTRACT  MM is a plasma cell neoplasm within the bone marrow with significant complexity and heterogeneity at the  molecular level. Despite improvements in the clinical outcomes achieved with newer therapies, wide inter-  individual variation in response to treatment is a major limitation in achieving consistent therapeutic effects, or  cures. Not all patients respond to initial therapies (innate resistance), and those that do frequently relapse with  refractory disease (acquired resistance). The central hypothesis we are addressing is that rational therapeutic  development in MM should be based on an understanding of the underlying genetics and biology of the tumor  that identify sensitivity and resistance to current and future drugs. In this Myeloma-DRSC we are proposing 3  Projects that will: 1) develop a high throughput drug screening platform for myeloma cell lines representing the  wide diversity of MM biology; and use this platform to screen primary patient tumor cells for most effective  responses, including combination therapies; 2) develop a comprehensive mutational and germline variation  panel that will be correlated to drug responses in vitro and in vivo, as well as toxicities; 3) identify the  mechanism of response and resistance for two of the most common therapeutics used in MM treatment:  IMiDS and proteasome inhibitors; 4) develop genetic and immunophenotypic signatures that effectively predict  tumor response, resistance, and patient toxicities; 5) identify tumor sub-populations that may contribute to  emerging resistance; and 6) identify strategies to predict drug resistance and approaches to overcome  resistance."

Based on our work, the first clinical  trial of combined PI3K and AR pathway inhibition was recently reported demonstrating a significant benefit for  combination therapy in patients with tumors harboring loss of PTEN. Our proposal aims to take these exciting  finding back to the pre-clinical space to 1) define biomarkers of intrinsic sensitivity and resistance to inform  appropriate patient selection for combination therapy; 2) define the mechanisms of acquired resistance; 3)  devise therapeutic strategies to overcome resistance; 4) optimize AR pathway targeting in the setting of PI3K  pathway inhibition to maximize tumor response and 5) explore the therapeutic role of FGFR in a novel subset  of AR negative prostate cancers."

"9574531","Many current clinical guidelines recommend that assessment of osteoporosis or low bone mass, as defined by the World Health Organization (WHO), be based on bone mineral density (BMD) at the femur neck region of the proximal femur (hip). The data on the prevalence of osteoporosis in the population by age, sex, and race and ethnicity are acquired by the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), a population based survey and physical assessment carried out in mobile examinations centers that are moved around the United States for sampling on a 2-year cycle. These data are an important component of the Healthy People 2020 tracking of the health of Americans. NIAMS has collaborated with the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS)/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in funding the osteoporosis component of NHANES.

"9444852","PROJECT 1 SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Despite recent advances in therapy the majority of multiple myeloma (MM) patients are not cured but rather  suffer from a chronic relapsing, yet ultimately fatal disease. Two challenges immediately become evident. Most  urgent is the need to find alternative therapies for patients who fail existing potent drug classes. Second, is to  understand why patients may be resistant in the first place and to seek methodologies, dosing strategies and  new drug combinations which can prevent or overcome drug-resistant relapse.  We propose an innovative strategy of ?direct to drug? screening of 500 primary patient samples with  chemogenomic interrogation which addresses both of these two big questions. Our hypothesis is that a direct  to drug analysis of individual patients will improve response rates, lower unnecessary toxicity and reduce drug  costs through identification of the most effective combinations of FDA approved drugs for each patient. This  strategy will also, for the purposes of this proposal, provide a database of samples and clinical data sets from  which to explore genomic or clinical correlates of drug sensitivity and resistance.  Our goal will be attained through the successful pursuit of three specific aims, building upon extensive cell line  and primary patient sample data. First, we will measure the in vitro sensitivity of 79 MM therapeutics including  CTEP compounds in 500 primary myeloma patient samples. Second, we will conduct combination screens to  seek synergistic combinations of IMiDs and proteasome inhibitors as base compounds with other active MM  therapeutics such as bromodomain inhibitors which can be tested in animal models such as the human CRBN  mouse in project 2. Third, using our M3P mutation panels, we will conduct a chemogenomic interrogation to  examine specific correlates of drug sensitivity and resistance utilizing pre-treatment and surviving cells from  primary patient robotic screens. These studies will determine the frequency of specific genetic mutation or  cellular subsets resistant to the most active drugs or drug combinations used in MM therapy and will be shared  throughout the program for further epigenetic and transcriptional analysis and bi-directional feedback derived  from both Projects 2 and 3.  Critical to the current U54 application this strategy will provide a database of 500 multiple myeloma samples  and linked clinical data sets which together build a mosaic of drug sensitivity and clinical phenotype from which  all elements of this program grant can exploit to explore genomic or clinical correlates of drug sensitivity and  resistance."
"9576712","Diet-Induced Hypomethylation in the Preneoplastic Liver Genetics and epigenetics of susceptibility to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) a comparative dietary study using Diversity Outbred (DO) mice  Investigating the molecular basis of how epigenomic and genomic factors influence susceptibility to Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in humans using human NAFLD samples is desirable but frequently impractical. In contrast, using relevant animal models that resemble human NAFLD development may substantially overcome the many limitations of human-only studies and provide important clues regarding the molecular consequences of etiological factors linked to NAFLD susceptibility and severity. This Inter-Agency Agreement (IAA) will investigate the extent of molecular changes indicative of NAFLD-associated liver injury (including nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), a progressive form of NAFLD) to assist in identifying susceptible individuals. Thus, we hypothesize that (a) the status of individual epigenomic hepatic phenotypes is a fundamental factor that predetermines susceptibility to NAFLD; and (b) an evaluation of epigenomic hepatic phenotypes in a genetically heterogeneous mouse population will assist in identifying individuals susceptible to NAFLD. To test the hypothesis, we plan to use a well-established dietary- (?Western Diet?) induced model of NASH in Diversity Outbred (DO) mice, a genetically heterogeneous mouse population.  We will identify individual mice exhibiting the greatest susceptibility to NAFLD-associated liver injury in the genetically diverse population of mice and define the role of epigenetic alterations in the pathogenesis of NAFLD. Next generation sequencing, chromatin immunoprecipitation with DNA microarray methodology (Chip-on-chip) and quantitative RT-PCR will be used to assess whole genome-scale epigenomic changes and expression of protein-coding and non-coding RNAs, especially microRNAs, in plasma, white blood cells, and livers of treated and control mice."
"9315739","Project Summary / Abstract: Cancer Imaging Program (CIP)  The scientific goal of the Cancer Imaging Program (CIP) is to develop and apply imaging technologies and  imaging methods for cancer prevention and intervention studies. Members of the CIP are working at the  forefront of the field and have been eminently successful in utilizing the theoretical underpinnings of imaging  science to advance new imaging technologies for a wide array of critical cancer applications. Program activities  are organized under three major themes: Theme 1) Advancement of major biomedical imaging technologies  for cancer; Theme 2) Molecular imaging and the development of advanced contrast agents, including analysis  of their mechanisms; and Theme 3) Advancement of theoretical image science related to cancer. The CIP  provides a dynamic cancer-focused environment that fosters inter-programmatic collaborations with a robust  translational pipeline that facilitates entry of research applications into investigator-initiated clinical trials (IITs).  CIP has two Specific Aims: Aim 1) To promote advances in imaging science and technology and their  application in the context of cancer biology, early cancer detection, development and monitoring of cancer  therapies, and cancer prevention studies; Aim 2) To promote translation of the science into clinical trials and  development and testing of new technologies in the clinic through investigator-initiated clinical trials (IITs) and  coordinated validation at other clinical sites. CIP leadership, in cooperation with the UACC and University of  Arizona (UA) leadership, is instrumental in securing sources for pilot funding for prototype testing/development  and in providing access to unique laboratory and clinical methodologies to aid researchers who are involved in  the discovery and development of new diagnostic methods and new anticancer therapies. The CIP builds on  the UA's excellence in imaging science.

"9446577","Prostate cancer is characterized by dependence on androgens for growth and drugs that target the androgen  receptor has been the mainstay of therapy. Under selection pressure of treatment, prostate cancer evolves  resistance mechanisms to grow despite therapy. In a subset of patients, the loss of prostate lineage  specification results in resistance to all therapy directed at the androgen receptor and there are few therapeutic  options. We have recently identified two mechanism of lineage plasticity prostate cancer that are reversible by  epigenetic therapy. The overall goal is to develop combination therapy to reverse or prevent lineage plasticity  and prolong response. First, we have observed that tumors with combined TP53 and RB1 loss progress to  androgen receptor independent disease that required activity of EZH2. This suggests that EZH2 is a  therapeutic target for this subset of prostate cancer. Second, we discovered that a subset of prostate cancer  aberrantly express HNF4G and HNF1A, master regulators of the gastrointestinal lineage, and bypass the  prostate lineage requirement for androgen signaling. Inhibition with BET inhibitors inhibit this pathway and re-  sensitize prostate cancer to androgen receptor directed therapy. In Aim 1, we will test the in vivo activity of  EZH2 inhibition in AR-negative prostate cancer in combination with the antiandrogen enzalutamide. In Aim 2,  we will test the in vivo activity of BET inhibition in HNF4G/HNF1A positive prostate cancer in combination with  enzalutamide. In Aim 3, we will perform preclinical studies of epigenetic inhibitor of BET, EZH2, and P300/CBP  in a large panel of patient-derived models of prostate cancer that reflect the clinical heterogeneity of human  prostate cancer. For our studies, we will use clinically relevant drugs that are either in clinical trials or are first  in class with clinical potential. The proposed research is innovative because it tests a novel paradigm that loss  of prostate lineage is reversible and druggable, and is significant because of the potential to rapidly develop  novel treatment to patients with few options."
"9446708","Project Summary/Abstract: Bioinformatics Core  The Bioinformatics Core will be established to support the PDX data and analysis for the Research Projects  and Cores of the WU-PDTC. Large PDX research projects involve many facets of information and require  formalized bioinformatic and biostatistical support to effectively collate information and translate discoveries  from the preclinical setting. The Core will provide both the infrastructure to house the experimental data and  the interpretive tools and personnel to analyze these data. These responsibilities fall into 3 basic categories.  (1) We will use our bioinformatics pipeline to process and align raw genomic and proteomic data with specific  tools to find variant SNVs, SVs, indels, CNVs, etc and will use these results to assess potential druggability in  the expanded original human tumors under the noisy conditions imposed by the confounding host animal. (2)  We will use a broad set of statistical analyses to draw inferences from the combination of mutation/expression  data, curated information, expression outlier analysis, structural analysis, co-inhibition assessment, and larger  examination of pathways members regarding the effectiveness of various treatments (vehicle/treatment,  dosage-response, time course, etc.) applied in the research and pilot projects. (3) We will organize all of this  information, as well as all PDX associated metadata (e.g. molecular and histopathologic data for both the  patient and PDX tumors, passage, and therapeutic experimental data, etc.) in a dedicated relational tracking  database that will support both our local analysis and submission obligations and the information integration  with other PDTCs and PTCCCs. These informatic and statistical tools will be integrated across the PDXNet to  provide a valuable, lasting resource for future trials designs and possible repurposing of drugs across cancer  types."
"9446576","Project 1 Summary/Abstract  Project 1 of the MSKCC-UW/Fred Hutch Prostate Cancer Drug Resistance and Sensitivity Center focuses on  acquired resistance to hormone therapy that is caused by androgen receptor (AR) pathway reactivation. The  project consists of two Aims, based on two different mechanisms of AR pathway activation. Aim 1 focuses on  the glucocorticoid receptor, which we and others have shown can substitute for AR to drive tumor growth  through a bypass mechanism. Clinical datasets, albeit limited at this stage, suggest that this mechanism could  be responsible for 20-30% of acquired resistance to enzalutamide. The experiments in Aim 1 will explore the  preclinical activity of treatment regimens that target AR in combination with a competitive antagonist of GR  (from ORIC Pharmaceuticals) or with a BET domain inhibitor (from Constellation Pharmaceuticals) that  potently downregulates GR expression. Aim 2 addresses the more common circumstance where alteration of  AR itself is responsible for AR pathway reactivation, a circumstance present in more than 50% of acquired  resistance patients. This can occur through AR gene amplification, AR mRNA splice variants or AR mutations,  roughly in that order of frequency. Experiments in Aim 2 are designed to inhibit AR more potently than is  currently possible with current antagonists such as enzalutamide, first by interfering with the transcription of AR  and its downstream target genes using a CBP/p300 inhibitor (from AbbVie). We will also evaluate a tool  compound targeting the chromatin modifier G9A/EHMT2 that we recovered in a whole genome shRNA screen,  based on selective antiproliferative activity in combination with enzalutamide. Finally, we will conduct a screen  for drug targets that further impair AR transcriptional output beyond that seen with enzalutamide. In total, we  will evaluate four AR combination therapy regimens, three of which involve drugs that are currently in clinical  development or soon will be. In summary, this Project has the potential to generate multiple mechanism-based  combination therapy clinical trials together with insights into how to select patients using clinically feasible  biomarkers. Furthermore, the findings could be more broadly relevant to other hormone receptor dependent  diseases such as breast cancer."

"9574628","This IAA is composed of 2 projects:  Project 1  Hematopoietic cells and cells of the peripheral immune system are highly sensitive to the lethal effects of ionizing radiation.  Treatment of the hematopoietic acute radiation syndrome (H-ARS) has largely focused on stimulating neutrophil production to protect against infection.  The question of the fate of vaccine immunity, mediated by T cells, is critical as vaccine memory cannot be restored by the generation of new lymphocytes, leaving victims vulnerable to numerous exogenous and latent microorganisms to which they were previously immune. A revaccination approach involving numerous potential infectious agents may be impractical in a radiation mass casualty situation. In that light, this research will focuse on designing studies to identify a therapeutic or combination therapeutics to replace revaccination rescue. Project 2 The project will investigate telomere shortening and ARS using an immune-proficient rat model with the intent of developing telomere shortening as a surrogate marker of oxidative DNA damage due to ARS. Subsequent research will aim to translate findings from the animal model of telomere shortening using irradiated primary human tissue obtained from a repository."
