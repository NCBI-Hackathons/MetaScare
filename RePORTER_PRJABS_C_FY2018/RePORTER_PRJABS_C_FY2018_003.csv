"9327404","PROJECT SUMMARY  Memory is the unique capacity of brain to store information for extensive periods of time, however how memories persist for decades remains unclear. The formation and maintenance of long-term memory is believed to require the synthesis of new proteins inside the neuronal synapses. Cytoplasmic Polyadenlation Element Binding (CPEB) proteins are a family of proteins critical in regulating synaptic mRNA translation. Two CPEB family members, CPEB3 in mice, and Orb2 in Drosophila Melanogaster are capable of existing in a monomeric state or oligomeric self-replicating state, properties that are unique to functional prion-like proteins. Interestingly, only the oligomeric forms of CPEB/Orb2 proteins are critical for sustaining memory, which suggests CPEB/Orb2?s amyloidogenic self-aggregating activity promotes the persistence of memory in a dominant manner once formed. Thus, the experience-dependent conversion of CPEB/Orb2 from its monomeric to oligomeric state regulates the formation of long-term memory. However, the regulation of prion- like conversion of CPEB/Orb2 is relatively unknown.  Preliminary observations show that Orb2 is phosphorylated and phosphorylation regulates its stability. Intriguingly, phosphorylation also regulates Orb2?s interaction with other proteins that increase its ability to oligomerize. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that conversion of monomeric to oligomeric Orb2/CPEB is regulated by the phosphorylation. The first aim in this proposal is to identify both the kinases responsible for phosphorylating Orb2 and the residues of Orb2 being phosphorylated. The second aim is to genetically modulate Orb2?s phosphorylation state and examine how it affects Orb2 function in biochemical assays and as well as Orb2-depedent long-term memory in Drosophila.  Considering aberrant conversion of pathogenic prions is a hallmark of a number of neurodegenerative disorders and is associated with memory loss, a greater understanding of the cellular mechanisms regulating conversion of functional prion-like proteins may provide important insight for controlling amyloid production of different prion and prion-like proteins."
"9470703","A consequence of aging is the progressive loss of skeletal muscle mass, termed sarcopenia, leading to functional decline and impaired quality of life. One method to counteract sarcopenia is progressive resistance exercise training (PRT), which increases muscle mass and strength. The effectiveness of PRT is unparalleled by other treatments, but there is considerable inter-individual heterogeneity in responsiveness (defined by degree of muscle hypertrophy). We hypothesize a major cause of blunted muscle regrowth among low responders is an exaggerated response to inflammatory mediators consequent to abnormally high muscle expression of cytokine receptors (IL-6R, TNFR1, TWEAK-R (aka Fn14)), which we have termed muscle inflammation susceptibility (MuIS). We recently completed a four-arm, randomized clinical trial to determine the optimal PRT dosage for older adults (~65y) which identified 2 high intensity sessions, separated by a low intensity session (HLH) maximizes muscle regrowth (NCT02442479). Even in this optimized prescription, there are low responders. Therefore, in an ongoing follow-up randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial (NCT02308228) enrolling 100 atrophied older adults (65+ y), we are combining HLH with an anti-inflammatory drug (metformin) in an attempt to overcome the low responder phenotype. PRT-induced muscle hypertrophy requires net muscle protein synthesis (MPS), which in turn requires a sufficient pool of active ribosomes for the translation of new proteins. The accumulation of ribosomes (i.e. ribosome biogenesis) appears to be central to net MPS and PRT- induced muscle hypertrophy. We have shown load-induced ribosome biogenesis likely regulates the magnitude of muscle hypertrophy during PRT and that inhibiting ribosome biogenesis in vitro prevents myotube hypertrophy. The proposed experiments will test the central hypothesis that MuIS is responsible for blunted muscle hypertrophy by limiting ribosome biogenesis during PRT, via three aims: Aim 1: To determine if MuIS status influences PRT-induced muscle regrowth in older adults. Approach: Leveraging our ongoing PRT clinical trial, participants will be clustered by K-means cluster analysis as MuIS(+) or MuIS(-) based on muscle cytokine receptor expression. The primary outcome will be change in type II myofiber size after PRT. We will also determine if blunted muscle ribosome biogenesis occurs in MuIS(+) subjects. Aim 2: To determine if inflammation directly inhibits ribosome biogenesis and myotube hypertrophy. Approach: Primary satellite cells isolated from muscle biopsies of these subjects will be differentiated to myotubes and exposed to growth stimulation in the presence and absence of a pro-inflammatory milieu. Aim 3: To determine if metformin shifts MuIS(+) to MuIS(-). Approach: MuIS status will be determined in muscle biopsies collected over the course of treatment at three time points. These experiments are expected to significantly impact the field by increasing our understanding of MuIS and its bearing on the propensity for skeletal muscle regrowth in atrophied older adults."
"9470464","PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT The age-related loss of muscle mass, strength, and function, known as sarcopenia, represents one of the most common conditions in older adults. Of these conditions, sarcopenia is the only one for which no FDA-approved treatment exists. To promote independence and prevent disability in our aging population, the identification of drug targets for sarcopenia is crucial. Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) is an ideal model for this purpose because sarcopenia is accelerated in older people who have T2DM. It may be possible to identify new drug targets for the accelerated sarcopenia of T2DM by contrasting pathway dysregulation in healthy older controls and in patients with T2DM. One promising potential target, upregulated by the hyperglycemic milieu of T2DM, is non-enzymatic protein glycosylation (known as glycation) and the subsequent formation of advanced glycation end-products (AGE). This detrimental process is known to contribute to multiple conditions, including T2DM, Alzheimer?s disease, and low-grade inflammation. Increased AGE concentration has previously been linked to decreased muscle strength and function in cross-sectional studies. Furthermore, blocking AGE accumulation in animal models improves muscle mass. However, the role of AGE in sarcopenia in humans has yet to be substantiated. We propose that AGE represents a potential mediator of accelerated sarcopenia in humans with T2DM. However, more preliminary evidence of muscle AGE responsiveness to existing treatment modalities ? such as resistance exercise ? is needed to design specific clinical trials. The proposed ancillary study to parent R01 AG049611 will examine AGE in older subjects with T2DM and healthy controls before and after 12 weeks of progressive resistance exercise training. We hypothesize that progressive resistance exercise training will reduce AGE concentrations in plasma and muscle, and that these reductions will be associated with improved sarcopenia outcomes ? namely, muscle mass, strength, and function. We will also test the hypothesis that progressive resistance exercise training can improve protein glycation and AGE accumulation in T2DM older patients to levels not different from that of healthy older controls. By employing clinical, proteomic, and biochemical methodologies, the present study will address this hypothesis through three Specific Aims: 1) identify and quantify glycated protein targets in the skeletal muscle and plasma from older adults with and without T2DM, 2) identify the effects of progressive resistance exercise training on AGE concentration and downstream effectors of AGE, and 3) determine whether AGE concentration is associated with baseline differences or intervention-induced changes in measures of muscle mass, strength, or function, and estimate how much of the variation in these measures is explained by AGE concentration. Determining the impact of progressive resistance exercise training on AGE accumulation will inform the search for novel therapeutic targets of accelerated sarcopenia of T2DM, and assist in the design of future clinical trials."
"9467782","Project Summary/Abstract  Age-related cognitive decline gradually devolves into dementia (e.g. Alzheimer disease, AD). Emotional and healthcare burden, and the fact that AD-neuropathology precedes cognitive changes by many years, make the identification of biomarkers of early disease progression critically important. Aspects of AD neurochemistry other than ?-amyloid need to be considered while searching for a reliable biomarker. Glutamate (Glu), the primary excitatory neurotransmitter involved in cognitive processes, is reduced in several key brain regions (specifically the hippocampus, HC) in AD and normal aging. Episodic memory decline is the first cognitive symptom in AD, as well as normal aging. Episodic and associative memory relies on hippocampal Glu. Understanding age-related variations in this system may help track early decline in cognition.  Proton functional magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H fMRS) is the only non-invasive neuroimaging technique that can detect in vivo levels of Glu. We have recently demonstrated that 1H fMRS can detect the temporal dynamics of hippocampal Glu in healthy young adults, which in turn can predict learning proficiency. The long-term goal is to better elucidate the contribution of the glutamatergic system underlying age-related cognitive deficits. The overall objective is to demonstrate that 1H fMRS assessment of task-dependent changes in brain Glu can be harnessed for early prediction of the impending decline in a brain system central to AD. The overarching goal of this proposal is to investigate the relationship between Glu modulation and memory efficiency. The central hypothesis is that baseline levels of Glu, and Glu modulation, will be lower in the elderly, and will be positively correlated with their performance. Guided by strong preliminary data, the hypothesis will be tested by pursuing the following specific aims: 1) Identify the effect of age and basal Glu on associative learning/memory, 2) Determine the effect of age on task-related Glu-modulation in the HC; 3) Investigate whether age-differences in hippocampal Glu modulation during encoding are related to those in learning efficiency. Under these aims 1H fMRS, determined a feasible technique in the applicant?s lab, will be used and extended to healthy old adults. Analyses will be conducted to identify a relationship between age-differences in Glu modulation and memory performance.  Extant studies examining age-effects on Glu have done so using a non-task-active, static approach. The innovative approach here suggests the utility of variation in task-mediated Glu modulation as an early harbinger of age-related cognitive decline. The proposed research is significant, as it is expected to contribute to, and advance, the search for reliable functional neural biomarkers of neuro-degenerative disorders, and help track cognitive changes. Investigation of age-effects on the dynamics of Glu, an important neurotransmitter, will help gain new insights on age-differences in neurotransmission capacity and provide an effective framework to test better-targeted therapies to mitigate impending cognitive decline."
"9396753","PROJECT SUMMARY ABSTRACT Aging progressively deprives us of many essential functions, including those of our central nervous system (CNS). Neuroinflammation is linked to aging-associated cognitive impairments and dementia-related neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease. Therefore, it is essential to elucidate the mechanisms underlying increased inflammation in the aging brain, as a means to develop strategies to combat its deleterious effects on cognitive function. Microglia, the resident innate immune cells of the CNS, mediate neuroinflammation and play essential roles in the establishment and refinement of neuronal circuits. In particular, microglia incorporate signals from the microenvironment, such as neurons and systemic factors, to initiate appropriate neuron-supporting responses. On the other hand, it is also known that microglial dysfunction adversely affects neuronal and cognitive functions, including processes susceptible to the aging process, such as learning and memory. Indeed, microglia immune responses have been shown to directly contribute to cognitive dysfunction in models of age-related neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease. Given the connection between aged microglia and their microenvironment, together with their proposed role in the genesis of cognitive deficits under neurodegenerative disease conditions, mechanistic insight into what drives microglia aging is necessary to discover means to counteract the vulnerability of the aged brain to functional decline. Therefore, this proposal aims to test the hypothesis that age-related changes in the adult brain microenvironment promote aging and rejuvenation of microglia. The intent of the proposed study is to investigate the influence of the aging microenvironment on microglial inflammatory phenotypes by providing a detailed molecular and functional profile of age-related microglial responses to their changing microenvironment. This will be investigated with three Specific Aims. In Aim 1, the molecular heterogeneity of microglia in the aging hippocampal region of the brain will be characterized. Additionally, the molecular changes that occur during aging will be used to determine the processes that are disrupted in microglia of the aging hippocampus. In Aim 2, the role of the aging microenvironment in directing inflammatory phenotypes in young microglia will be determined using innovative and highly technical approaches. Lastly, in Aim 3 the sufficiency of a young microenvironment to rejuvenate aged microglia will be examined using the approaches developed in Aim 2. Successful completion of the proposed research will provide an in depth understanding of the molecular and cellular dynamics of microglial aging, as well as determining the influence of the aging hippocampal microenvironment on the microglial aging process. These studies will have translational potential for targeting neuroinflammation in the aging brain and neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease, by restoration of microglial function."
"9328950","PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT  Nationwide use of prescription opioids quadrupled to more than 240 million prescriptions per year between 1999 to 2010. This increase has been accompanied by an alarming rise in opioid misuse and abuse, addiction, and fatal and nonfatal overdoses. In response to this growing national epidemic, the Department of Health and Human Services has called for the creation of clear opioid prescribing guidelines and further developing the evidence base to guide opioid prescribing for the management of pain. To date, guidelines have largely focused on opioid use in younger adults despite the unique issues facing older adults (?65 years old) including a large burden of pain, extensive analgesics use, and recent increase in drug overdose-related deaths in the elderly population. Prior guidelines have provided no direction regarding appropriate opioid use to treat pain in nursing home residents. This is problematic due to the high prevalence of chronic pain in nursing home residents as well as age-related vulnerability to adverse drug events due to changes in pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics and higher prevalence of multiple comorbidities and polypharmacy in this population as compared to noninstitutionalized older adults.  Using an in-house national repository of Minimum Data Set 3.0 ? a federally required clinical assessment of all residents in Medicare or Medicaid certified nursing homes ? merged to Medicare Part A and D and facility-level characteristics in CASPER (Certification and Survey Provider and Enhanced Reporting) from 2011-2013, this proposal addresses the evidence gap in safe opioid use in US nursing home residents with three specific aims: 1) to identify sociodemographic, clinical, and facility-level correlates of opioid use in terms of duration of use (acute vs. chronic), duration of action (short- vs. long-acting), and dose in ?morphine equivalents?; 2) to estimate the incidence of opioid-related drug overdoses and identify resident- and drug regimen-related risk factors for opioid overdose; and 3) to evaluate the comparative safety of specific commonly-initiated opioids in terms of serious adverse health outcomes (all-cause mortality, hospitalization for cardiovascular disease, fractures, and bowel obstruction). Methodological innovations include the use of multilevel modeling and targeted maximum likelihood estimation approaches. This proposal is directly relevant to the approximately 1.4 million older adults living in US nursing homes on any given day ? many of whom will receive opioids while institutionalized. The knowledge generated will inform stakeholders on how opioids are used in this population, the risk of overdose when using opioids, and the comparative safety of short- and long- term use of commonly initiated opioids in the nursing home setting."

"9468906","Project Summary/Abstract Alzheimer?s disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia in the elderly, and may become a new epidemic in the 21st century in accordance with the rapid growth of the aging population. There is currently no known cure or treatment to stop the progression of AD. Moreover, the basic molecular mechanisms responsible for AD remain elusive. Two key events in AD pathophysiology are impaired capacity of de novo protein synthesis (mRNA translation) and disrupted cellular energy homeostasis. AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) acts as a central cellular energy sensor to maintain cellular energy homeostasis. Furthermore AMPK integrates several signaling pathways (including AKT, GSK3, mTORC1, and eEF2) controlling de novo protein synthesis, dysregulation of which is implicated in cognitive syndromes associated with neurodegenerative diseases including AD. Mammalian AMPK is a heterotrimeric protein with a catalytic ? subunit and regulatory ?/? subunit. The ? subunit of AMPK exists in two isoforms: ?1 and ?2, and their roles in AD are unknown. By investigating brain tissue from post mortem human AD patients and a transgenic mouse model of AD, I have found that levels of AMPK?1 are dramatically increased while levels of AMPK?2 are decreased. The central hypothesis of the current project is that disruption of AMPK isoform homeostasis represents a key molecular mechanism of AD pathophysiology. Thus, the objective of this project is to determine whether selective AMPK isoform inhibition (and subsequent altering of AMPK isoform homeostasis) alleviates AD-associated deficits in protein synthesis and memory formation. This project will utilize a novel mouse model in which Prkaa1 and Prkaa2 (genes that encode AMPK ?1 and ?2 subunits, respectively) were removed in excitatory neurons in forebrains and hippocampus late in development, to generate brain- and isoform-specific conditional AMPK?1 and ?2 knockout mice (AMPK?1 cKO and AMPK?2 cKO). We have further crossed the heterozygous AMPK?1/2 cKO mice [AMPK?1(+/-) and AMPK?2(+/-)] with Tg19959 AD mouse model (containing two familial AD mutations: K670N and V717F) to generate Tg19959/AMPK?1(+/-) and Tg19959/AMPK?2(+/-) double mutant mice. Using behavioral, electrophysiological, and biochemical methods, the experiments here will 1) elucidate the effects of genetic repression of AMPK isoforms on AD-associated synaptic plasticity impairments; 2) determine the effects of AMPK isoform suppression in learning and memory deficits in AD model mice; and 3) establish whether specific AMPK isoform reduction improves AD pathology, including brain amyloid deposition and de novo protein synthesis impairments. The experimental findings derived from this project will help elucidate a novel mechanism for AD pathophysiology, shedding a light on potentially new diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets."
