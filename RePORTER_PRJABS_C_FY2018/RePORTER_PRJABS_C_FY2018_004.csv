"9395602","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The objective of this postdoctoral fellowship (F32) application is to promote the Candidate, Maura Kepper, Ph.D., into a path of independent research focused on identifying targets and translating findings to intervention strategies that alter neighborhood environments to promote the healthy development of our youth. The proposed research will employ a convergent mixed methods approach to generate a comprehensive understanding of how and which environmental factors play a crucial role in parental constraint of outdoor play and contribute to low levels of within-neighborhood physical activity. Given the Candidate's significant research experience exploring the influence of neighborhood environments on health, the goal of this proposal is to integrate her current quantitative skills with focused training in new learning areas to provide a strong foundation for an independent research career. Together, the sponsor, co-sponsors and consultants are fully committed to assisting the Candidate to reach her research training and career development goals and to successfully implement the proposed research. The proposed study provides the opportunity for the necessary training in 1) the management, analysis, and interpretation of linked accelerometry data, global positioning systems (GPS) technologies, and spatial data (e.g. neighborhood boundaries, locations of parks) and 2) mixed methods research. The Candidate will benefit from the proposed project by collaborating as an investigator on a large longitudinal, observational study, Translational Investigation of Growth and Everyday Routines in Kids (TIGER Kids) Study (USDA 3092-51000-056-04A), that will expand her research to a large cohort (n=340) of African American and Caucasian girls and boys, 10 to 16 years of age. The proposed research will add state- of-the-art quantitative measures (i.e., GPS, accelerometry, and virtual Systematic Social Observation) and in- depth interviews with parents/guardians of TIGER Kids participants to gain a comprehensive understanding of how neighborhood social and physical environments influence parental constraint of outdoor play and reduce offspring's within-neighborhood physical activity. This research proposal has two main aims: A1) implement quantitative methods to delineate the relationships between the social environment (parental perceived collective efficacy), parental constrained outdoor play practices and offspring within-neighborhood physical activity and A2) implement qualitative methods (in-depth interviews) among parents/guardians living in varied neighborhood physical environments (i.e., low vs. high incivilities) to gain in-depth information and perspectives of the social environment's influence on constrained outdoor play practices. The proposal also aims to quantitatively examine the potential moderating effect of the neighborhood physical environment (i.e., incivilities) (A1a). Findings from the proposed study will provide a critical foundation for the Candidate's independent research to develop community-based interventions to reduce parental constraints on outdoor play and increase physical activity levels that promote healthy development during childhood and adolescence."

"9471727","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):            Our hands are the primary means by which we explore and manipulate our environment. They perform thousands of intricate movements without conscious thought or even visual attention. Sensory feedback is a critical element of these complex activities. Lack of sensory feedback in myoelectric upper limb prostheses makes fluid and complex motions difficult and requires the user to maintain visual attention on the prosthesis to perform even the simplest task. In this project, we will address the need for sensory feedback by implanting non-penetrating cuff electrodes on the residual upper limb nerves. Our central hypothesis is that direct nerve stimulation with selective, non-penetrating cuff electrodes on the residual upper limb nerves can elicit graded sensation and proprioception at multiple locations in the perceptual hand. Further, restoration of sensory feedback with cuff electrodes will reduce visual and cognitive load during prosthesis usage, improve functional performance, and result in embodiment of the prosthesis. In the first funded merit review, the electrode and stimulation technology was developed and fully prepared for clinical implementation. The FDA and local IRB approved investigation of the system in amputees under an investigational device exemption, IDE #G110043. The first subject was implanted in May of 2012. In the first subject, stimulation through 19 active contacts produced 19 unique locations of sensory perception on the subject's perceptual hand. The locations of the perception and the stimulation parameters continue to remain stable, which is more than six month at time of this proposal submission. Further, by modulating stimulation patterns, several perceptions can be produced at each location on the phantom, including pressure, slip, tingling, and pricking. We have, for the first time, shown peripheral nerve stimulation produces highly selective, stable, and normal sensory perception in many places on the phantom of the person with limb loss. The purpose of this project is to study these results in a full cohort of five subjects, demonstrate home use of sensory feedback, and demonstrate improved usage and sense of embodiment resulting from natural sensory feedback. We have a strong working relationship with Otto Bock and Hanger Clinic, providing a solid team poised to make a significant and real impact on veterans, wounded warriors, and the upper limb loss community, as a whole. Specifically, the aims for this project are: Aim 1: Characterize sensory perception. Upper extremity peripheral nerve stimulation elicits graded sensory perceptions in more than one location on the phantom limb and the perceptions are stable up to at least two years. Aim 2: Demonstrate functional improvement. Stable sensory perception elicited by cuff electrodes will reduce attention and visual load required for adequate prosthesis control and will improve functional performance. Aim 3: Demonstrate embodiment. Stable sensory perception elicited by cuff electrodes in synchrony with physical stimuli applied to the artificial limb will result in embodiment of the artificial limb. Aim 4: Design and verify an implantable stimulator for  permanent sensory restoration. To reach a larger population, a fully implanted system will be required. While it is premature for investment in a fully implanted device, the stimulation circuity will be developed in a bench-top system to prepare for future implant development. In collaboration with Otto Bock, the Michelangelo AxonBus hand and wrist system will be our prosthesis development platform. Collaboration with Hanger Clinic will provide valuable patient-centric guidance and access to a substantial candidate pool. Following successful execution of the work proposed, we expect to show permanent improvement in upper limb prosthesis performance and user embodiment due to permanent, natural sensory feedback through peripheral nerves."
"9470399","PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Body size is a fundamental aspect of biology and health. However, despite many recent gains in understand- ing its genetic variation underpinnings, the proximate cellular causes of variation in intra- and inter-population body size are largely unknown. At one extreme, small body size, or the ?pygmy? phenotype, is a characteris- tic of rainforest hunter-gatherers (RHGs) worldwide, and this genetically-mediated trait is likely an adaptation to the harsh ecological conditions of tropical rainforests for human inhabitants. Comparisons between RHG and non-RHG populations thus present a natural human model for studying the genetic, functional, and evolutionary bases of growth and body size. I propose to investigate the genome-wide regulatory response to Insulin-like Growth Factor 1 (IGF1) and a Fibroblast Growth Factor (FGF-9) in experiments with chondrocytes derived from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) for population samples of the Batwa RHGs of Uganda (N=20) and their agriculturalist neighbors the Bakiga (N=20). I will estimate genome-wide gene expression responses to IGF1 and FGF-9 via RNAseq and identify differentially expressed (DE) genes by treatment (baseline vs. challenge), population, and population x treatment interaction?i.e. genes with Batwa-speci?c response to IGF1 or FGF-9. I will also simultaneously characterize the IGF1 and FGF-9 responses in chimpanzee and baboon iPSC-derived chondrocytes, thus allowing the partitioning of variation in growth factor response into human lineage-speci?c, human population-speci?c, and shared components. The sets of Batwa- and Bakiga-speci?c DE response genes will be intersected with results from population genomic analyses of SNP genotype data from the same popula- tions to test whether DE genes are signi?cantly enriched within genome regions containing signatures of positive selection. Comparisons to other datasets will facilitate the identi?cation of loci with potential phenotypic and clin- ical signi?cance. This comparative functional genomics investigation of a powerful, relevant in vitro system from a natural human model will advance our understanding of critical human growth and development pathways. The proposed study will be the ?rst genome-wide functional genomic investigation in a relevant cell type of the growth factor response in a human population characterized by the pygmy phenotype. As one of the ?rst iPSC studies of Africans and the ?rst of RHGs, the project integrates human cellular models with population genomic methods to afford an expanded view of human genomic and functional diversity. Unlike previous studies, the proposed project will have the scope, relevant cell type, and power necessary to explore the growth factor pathway disruptions that play a role in the pygmy phenotype in RHGs. The project and training proposed as part of my NRSA fellowship will advance my career goal of integrating population genomic and functional genomic approaches to understand biomedically relevant adaptations and will be ideal for my transition to an independent researcher exploring the biomedical relevance of past evolutionary adaptations."
"9396035","Project Summary/Abstract Examining the Heterogeneity of Fibroblasts in the Pancreatic Microenvironment Pancreatic cancer has a highly dysplastic tumor stroma present from the onset of carcinogenesis. The cellular components of this stroma consist largely of activated fibroblasts and infiltrating immune cells. Since pancreatic cancer is largely refractory to chemotherapy, the current ideology is to target the stroma in conjunction with the cancer in order to enhance drug perfusion and effectiveness. The utility of targeting the fibroblasts within the stroma remains controversial though-- data show the fibroblasts support tumor growth while also restraining it from being as aggressive. The fibroblasts in the pancreatic cancer microenvironment have long been treated like a homogenous population, derived from the pancreatic stellate cells; however, no lineage tracing experiment has demonstrated this possibility. Recent studies have indicated that the fibroblast population is not uniform, raising the possibility that different subpopulations might either promote or restrain cancer progression and growth. Characterizing the diverse fibroblast populations within the pancreatic cancer stroma is necessary to target this population therapeutically. A pilot study in collaboration with Dr. Deneen Wellik, co-Sponsor for this application, discovered a population of fibroblasts in the adult pancreas that express Hoxb6 and that includes pancreatic stellate cells. Importantly, Hoxb6 is not widely expressed in fibroblast populations in other organs and tissues. Based on this observation, we are in the position to lineage trace and functionally evaluate normal pancreas fibroblasts during pancreatic carcinogenesis. The overall objective of this proposal is to identify and functionally characterize the Hoxb6 fibroblast subset in the context of pancreatic cancer. The HYPOTHESIS of this application is that the Hoxb6 fibroblast population gives rise to an active component of the fibrotic stroma that affects cancer growth. Transgenic reporter mouse models and primary cell cultures will be used to characterize and functionally assess this novel population of fibroblasts. ="
"9468212","Project Summary  Animals live in close association with bacteria, including both beneficial symbionts and harmful pathogens. Understanding the nuances that enable hosts to respond differently to pathogenic versus beneficial interactions could enable therapies that specifically target pathogens. A fundamental interface between bacterial and animal cells is the bacterial cell wall. In particular, cell wall peptidoglycan (PG) is known to be a key molecule in the infection process, both for pathogens such as Bordetella pertussis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae and also for symbionts such as Vibrio fischeri. In the model symbiosis of the pea aphid, Acyrthosiphon pisum, with its bacterial symbiont, Buchnera aphidicola, key enzymes in the pathway for PG recycling are encoded in the host genome and are known to be specifically expressed in the cells that harbor the symbiotic bacteria, and similar observations have been made in other eukaryotic systems. The focus of this proposal is to test the novel hypothesis that host control of PG recycling is a key mechanism for host regulation of symbiont populations. We will test this hypothesis using novel biochemical and genetic approaches within the pea aphid system. Specifically, we hypothesize that variation in Buchnera abundance between aphids can be explained by differences in the level of host-derived PG gene expression, that the host employs proteins that alter the Buchnera cell wall, and that host control over Buchnera PG recycling establishes stability of Buchnera population sizes. Testing this hypothesis will shed light on how animals domesticate pathogenic bacteria and convert them into symbionts, and, more broadly, will expand our fundamental understanding of microbial interactions with animals, including humans.  To define the role of PG recycling in the regulation of symbiosis, we will: 1) investigate whether PG- related host genes play a role in determining Buchnera population size, 2) determine how host PG-related genes interact functionally with the Buchnera cell wall, and 3) demonstrate the relationship between host PG genes and Buchnera regulation in vivo. To test this, we will quantify the differences in PG gene expression levels between aphid genotypes with high versus low Buchnera abundance, characterize how host gene products affect Buchnera PG in vitro, and interrogate PG gene functions in vivo, implementing novel genetic tools for the aphid-Buchnera system. We predict that aphids use PG genes to disrupt Buchnera PG recycling and halt cell division, enabling hosts to control symbiont abundance by negative regulation. Our genome-scale approaches will enable discovery of other potential genetic bases of symbiont control. Results of the proposed work will contribute significantly to our understanding of how animals interact with symbiotic bacteria and, more specifically, how hosts regulate symbionts. These findings may lead to novel drugs targeting bacterial symbionts of insect disease vectors, or to the development of antibiotics that do not harm beneficial symbionts."

"9573363","Abstract Privacy is receiving much attention with the unprecedented increase in the breadth and depth of biomedical datasets, particularly personal genomics datasets. Most studies on genomic privacy are focused on protection of variants in personal genomes. Molecular phenotype datasets, however, can also contain substantial amount of sensitive information. Although there is no explicit genotypic information in them, subtle genotype-phenotype correlations can be used to statistically link the phenotype and genotype datasets. We will study the methodologies for analysis of sensitive information leakage from phenotype datasets. We will focus on the RNA-seq datasets and the associated sources of sensitive information leakage. These leakages are mediated by the expression quantitative trait loci. We will approach the privacy analysis under 3 aims. We will first aim at proposing statistical metrics that can be used for quantification of the sensitive information leakage from phenotype datasets. These quantifications can be used to evaluate the risks of privacy breaches. In the second aim, we will focus systematical analysis of how linking attacks can be instantiated and analyzed. We will study how one can generalize linking attacks that enables the privacy researchers study the risks associated with these attacks more systematically. We will then evaluate different models of genotype prediction and assess how these can be used in linking attacks. We will focus, specifically, on the outlier gene expression levels and evaluate how the outliers can be used for genotype prediction and in the linking attacks. In the third aim, we will develop tools that implement the quantification, risk estimation, and risk management methodologies and integrate these in a coherent software suite for a comprehensive privacy analysis, which enables protecting RNA-seq datasets at different levels of summarizations of the datasets, e.g., reads, gene and transcript quantifications. We will aim at increasing the number of software tools for genomic privacy analysis. We will study different algorithmic approaches to tackle with the high computational complexity of anonymization techniques in the literature. We will study sources of sensitive information leakage other than gene expression levels, e.g. splicing and non-coding transcription. These sources of information will be studied in the context of risk quantification and management strategies presented in the previous aims. We will finally use the tools to quantify the sensitive information in the publicly available datasets from large sequencing projects, for example ENCODE, 1000 Genomes, TCGA, GEUVADIS, and GTex."
"9470831","Project Summary/Abstract  Enzymes are well known for catalyzing chemical transformations with exquisite specificity and selectivity under environmentally benign conditions. Thus, there is a continuing need for the development of new enzymes that can effect critical synthetic transformations. One important type of reaction that is absent from the current catalytic repertoire of biology is the formation of carbon-boron bonds. Organoboron molecules have wide applications in organic synthesis, cancer therapy, and medicine. This prevalence of organoborons necessitates the development of new methods for introducing boron into molecules with high efficiency and selectivity. The focus of this proposal is to generate the first borylating enzymes and use them to expand the chemical space of biocatalysis to include carbon-boron bonds. The specific aims are: (1) 1: Develop the first enzymatic borylation via heme-protein-catalyzed iron-carbenoid insertion into B-H bonds. (2) Expand the scope of diazo compounds for the biocatalytic B-H insertion reaction. (3) Mechanistic and Structural Studies of the Optimized Borylation Enzymes. These aims will be initiated using the large number of existing mutants of various heme proteins in the Arnold Lab followed by directed evolution. Initial hits have been identified which provide a good starting point for directed evolution. We will perform detailed mechanistic and structural studies of the enzymes developed in this project, which will reveal the molecular basis of the improved activity and selectivity brought by the beneficial mutations. This knowledge is important for the further development of enzymatic borylation reactions, and can also be extended to other carbene-transfer reactions. The completion of these aims will open the door for new, highly selective, and sustainable strategies for synthesis of important, hard-to-make boron-containing molecules of biological and biomedical relevance."
"9400980","Project Summary Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) comprise a range of heterogeneous neurodevelopmental disorders that manifest in early childhood with abnormal motor and social behaviors. Autism has long been synonymous with social reward processing deficits and repetitive behaviors, but has recently been associated with deficits in goal-directed decision making and the processing of non-social rewards as well. Both the complex genetic etiology and variable phenotypic presentation of ASD have made an understanding of the specific higher-order circuit dysfunctions mediating this complex behavioral picture difficult to ascertain. With this proposal, we seek to explore how perturbations to one high-risk ASD gene, Neurexin1?, contribute to specific circuit disruptions that mediate the processing of rewards.  Preliminary data from goal-directed tasks developed in our lab suggest abnormalities in non-social reward processing in Neurexin1? mutant mice. Mice exhibit a deficit in flexible response behavior in new reward contingencies that is more pronounced in reward environments with larger disparities in net benefit. While recent studies have begun to explore both the role of the dorsomedial striatum in flexible goal-directed behaviors, and the role of projection inputs onto striatal compartments in regulating their activity, few have mapped an association between genetic insults to these striatal circuits and behavioral pathology in neuropsychiatric disease. I hypothesize that Neurexin1? loss-of-function disturbs particular afferent projection inputs innervating the dorsomedial striatum, and that these circuit abnormalities mediate specific features of the goal-directed phenotypes we observe in Neurexin1? mutant mice. In Aim 1, I will use modified versions of our behavioral task to further refine our understanding of how Neurexin1? mutants weigh benefits and costs to execute value-based control of motor output. In Aim 2, I will perform circuit-specific knockouts of Neurexin1? using a conditional knockout line and utilize our behavioral paradigms to assess the relative contribution of these targeted molecular disruptions to the observed goal-directed phenotypes. This approach will serve as the foundation for a circuit-based analysis of altered neuronal coding that occurs in Neurexin1? mutants during value-based choice. In sum, I believe these aims should provide an excellent opportunity for training in cutting-edge behavioral and molecular neuroscience approaches, and have the potential to greatly inform our understanding of the cellular basis of reward processing dysfunction in neuropsychiatric disease. 1"
"9469809","PROJECT SUMMARY! More than 1.4 million people are diagnosed with colorectal cancer (CRC) each year, and while increased rates of endoscopic screening have led to a slight reduction in mortality, the disease still accounts for more than 600,000 deaths worldwide annually. Compounding this problem, in recent years there has been a disproportionate increase in early onset CRC, highlighting it as a major, ongoing public health problem. Treatments for CRC have changed little over the past 10-15 years, and we still have no effective targeted therapies for the majority of CRC patients; new strategies are urgently needed. Hyperactivation of the WNT signaling pathway is a hallmark and major oncogenic driver of CRC, occurring in ~95% of tumors. Indeed, there is strong evidence from pre-clinical model systems that targeting hyperactive WNT signaling can provide significant therapeutic benefit in CRC. However, unlike many other oncogenic signaling networks, controlling WNT pathway activity with drugs has proven quite challenging. Relatively recent work has drawn attention to Tankyrase (TNKS) enzymes as an exciting therapeutic target in CRC. These enzymes positively regulate WNT signaling levels, but their activity can be inhibited by certain small molecule inhibitors. Early work has demonstrated that TNKS inhibitors can suppress hyperactive WNT signaling and impede cancer cell proliferation; however, those same inhibitors are extremely toxic in vivo, due to their suppression of WNT signaling in normal intestinal stem cells. Tumors often contain significant disruptions to their genomes, including gains and losses of large chromosome segments. These losses are presumed to support cancer cell growth, but also lead to loss of `passenger' genes that do not drive cancer progression, but may unintentionally `rewire' the signaling networks. I will test the hypothesis that large chromosomal deletions, common in CRC, create a tumor-specific vulnerability for selective inhibition of one specific Tankyrase family member ? TNKS2. Because normal cells do not carry these tumor-associated deletions, they should remain unaffected when inhibiting this single TNKS enzyme. In Aim 1, using a combination of new CRISPR-based genome editing technology, with inducible and reversible shRNA tools, I will determine how heterozygous and homozygous chromosome deletions impact the response to TNKS2 inhibition. Further, I aim to test small molecule inhibitors that selectively target TNKS2. In Aim 2 I will utilize a unique transgenic shRNA technology, developed by my mentor, to examine the toxicity and efficacy of selective TNKS2 inhibition in vivo. This genetic approach is powerful, as it allows an assessment of potent and systemic gene silencing without the limitation of poor drug delivery or specificity. Identifying a safe and effective approach to disrupt hyperactivated WNT signaling will have a profound impact on the clinical management of CRC. Thus, we believe our work will contribute significant pre-clinical data to develop safe and effective targeted therapies for CRC."
"9560619","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):      Although considered a modifiable risk factor for coronary artery disease (CAD) in the general population, the magnitude of physical activity required to promote cardiorespiratory fitness and a clinically meaningful change in blood-derived biomarkers of CAD is not achievable in those with a severe physical disability, such as with immobilizing paralysis from spinal cord injury (SCI). During the chronic phase of SCI, a characteristic dyslipidemia emerges, with mean serum high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) concentrations <40 mg/dl, a threshold level for HDL-C that is appreciated to be an independent risk factor for CAD, elevations in triglycerides (TG) to concentrations at, or near, target values for the general population that trigger clinical intervention, and low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) concentrations that are within the normal range. It should not be a surprise that cardiovascular disease (CVD)-related morbidity in persons with SCI occurs earlier in life, at a greater prevalence than that of the general population, and is the primary cause of death after the first year of injury. Population-based epidemiological studies are unavailable for clinical guidance because of the relatively low incidence rates for SCI. Clinical target values used to initiate treatment in the general populatio may be inappropriate in those with SCI because of their unique pathophysiology. In the absence of significant physical activity and lifestyle modifications, it would seem that appropriate pharmaceutical options are needed to properly manage markers of CVD-related risk in persons with SCI. To date, there is limited empirical evidence to support the use of lipid- lowering treatments in persons with SCI.  Fenofibrate is a fibric acid derivate that activates peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor a and lipoprotein lipase, leading to enhanced elimination of TG from plasma. In clinical trials where fenofibrate was used as a monotherapy, serum TG concentrations fell 41-53%, very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) fell 38-52%, LDL-C decreased 6-20%, and HDL-C improved by as much as 20%. In consideration for the nature of dyslipidemia in persons with SCI, fenofibrate appears to be an appropriate first-line agent for treatment in this cohort, especially because most of those with SCI have LDL values that are within the clinically acceptable range. In the general population, standard clinical practice for lipid-lowering treatment with fenofibrate monotherapy follows a known and clinically accepted timeline to monitor safety and to determine therapeutic efficacy. It is recommended that, if after 2 months of continuous therapy there are no beneficial changes to the lipoprotein profile, that treatment be discontinued (i.e., non-responders). Similarly, several large clinical trials have demonstrated that the peak therapeutic effects of fenofibrate are observed after 12-16 weeks of treatment (i.e., responders). The proposed study will test the efficacy of administering fenofibrate to persons with SCI, a severely immobilized cohort that does not have established clinical practice guidelines to treat dyslipidemia and appears to have unique considerations that may be hypothesized to call for a more disease-specific approach for care. If successful, the treatment will reduce clinical markers of CVD-related risk by modifying the concentration and number of particles that are known to contribute to incident cardiac events and mortality. It is anticipated that the insight gained from this investigation will provide clinicians with a proof-of  concept for instituting appropriate use of lipid lowering agents to treat the dyslipidemia that has  been well described in persons with SCI."
"9396590","Abstract Excessive alcohol use remains a significant public health problem in the US. A better understanding of the psychological processes underlying excessive drinking is needed so that more effective interventions can be developed. Recent research has focused on impaired control, manifest as a failure to avoid drinking or to limit consumption once it has begun. To better understand the processes underlying impaired control, we developed a novel human laboratory model (Resist CASE) that assesses actual consumption behavior indicative of impaired control. If Resist CASE is a good model, it could be used to evaluate whether impaired control can be modified by psychological or pharmacological manipulations. In the proposed study, we compare self-administration of alcohol in the laboratory model against actual drinking behavior in the field using ecological momentary assessment (EMA). The Sponsor and Co-Sponsor have expertise in laboratory and field assessments respectively. EMA will include assessment of current motivation to abstain and recent drinking. Heavy drinkers (N=37) will complete two Resist CASE sessions, one with a priming alcohol exposure and one without. At each session the ability to resist self-administering alcohol will be assessed (?Resist?), as well as self-administration during an open bar (?Lab Consumption?). Participants will complete six weeks of EMA to assess motivation and drinking. The overall goal is to examine the validity of the laboratory model. The specific aims are 1) To examine the association between ability to resist alcohol self- administration in the lab (Resist) and the ability to abstain from drinking in the real-world, assessed using EMA; 2) To examine the association between alcohol self-administration in the lab during open bar (Lab Consumption) and drinking behavior in the real-world, assessed using EMA; and 3) To examine predictors of resisting and drinking in the lab and field. Laboratory and EMA data from this study may ultimately help to develop algorithms that can predict when an individual is at risk of drinking, and to develop interventions, administered in the field, to reduce the risk of poor outcomes associated with drinking."
"9405814","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):      One of the most common and debilitating features of aphasia is an impairment in ability to retrieve words, whether it involves naming seen objects, or producing nouns, verbs and other words conveying meaning in spontaneous propositional speech. The long-term goal of this line of research is to establish an effective, viable, evidence-based treatment program for word retrieval deficits in persons with acquired aphasia from stroke. The short-term goal, and focus of this project, is to conduct a final phase II trial that tests the efficacy of an experimental treatent (called phonomotor) against customary and usual treatment (i.e. semantic-based therapy) for anomia in aphasia. In the context of a 2-armed control trial, we propose to deliver 60 total hours of therapy to 80 individuals who have suffered a left hemisphere stroke and exhibit aphasia with significant anomia. Effects of treatment acquisition and generalization will be measured at 3 time points (immediately, 3-months and 1-year post treatment termination). The primary aim will address between group differences of confrontation naming performance of untrained nouns at 3 months. Secondary questions will address generalization of treatment to measures of ecologic validity and discourse production. Through a series of phase I and phase II trials, we have shown that intensively delivered phonomotor treatment not only improves confrontation naming performance on trained words but, as predicted by the theory motivating it, importantly achieves generalization to naming of untrained words, some aspects of discourse production, and indicators of quality of life. The treatment program is motivated by a connectionist model of phonology (Nadeau, 2001; Nadeau, 2006, Nadeau, 2012) and by a two level interactive model of language (Dell, 1987). The theoretical foundation for the phonomotor treatment is as follows: through the systematic training of phonemes (sounds) and phoneme sequences, the neural connectivity supporting phoneme sequence knowledge will be enhanced. Because these sound sequences provide the basis for the words that represent concepts, through bidirectional spread of activation among and between linguistic levels, generalization from treating phonemes can be expected to improve naming of untrained words and discourse production, both immediately after treatment and continued beyond treatment termination."

"9550859","Spinal cord injury causes many bladder complications for life, such as impaired bladder emptying, recurrent urinary tract infection and stones, kidney damage, and incontinence, which impair health and quality of life and result in considerable cost to health care systems, in spite of state of the art management using medications, appliances and surgery. These complications are often due to unco-ordinated and unwanted contractions of the bladder and the external urethral sphincter, the muscle that restricts the flow of urine out of the bladder through the urethra. Contraction of the sphincter has been managed by cutting the sphincter or the nerves to the sphincter, inserting cylindrical metal mesh stents to keep it open, and injection of muscle toxins into the sphincter, but none of these is ideal and some have significant complications, and many patients require intermittent or indwelling catheters to remove urine from the bladder, and these too have their complications. Recently a technique has been developed and refined to block conduction in nerves rapidly and reversibly using electrical stimulation, and this has been used in animals with chronic spinal cord injury to prevent contraction in the pudendal nerves to the sphincter and to allow reliable emptying of the bladder. This project proposes to test this technique for the first time in human subjects with chronic spinal cord injury, using electrodes that can be inserted through a needle and left in place for several days and used to apply electrical stimulation while measuring the ability of human subjects to empty the bladder in the laboratory. After making these measurements the electrodes will be removed by pulling gently on them. If this project is successful it will justify the development and testing of a stimulation system that can be fully implanted by surgery to provide long term management of this problem."
"9469643","Project Summary Over one billion people worldwide are affected by iron overload, iron deficiency, and states of malnutrition that perturb iron homeostasis. The master regulator of systemic iron metabolism is hepcidin, a hormone that is predominately synthesized and released by the liver. The function of hepcidin is to bind to the only mammalian iron exporter, ferroportin, resulting in ubiquitination, internalization, and degradation of ferroportin. Therefore, in the presence of hepcidin, small amounts of iron are mobilized from stores; in the absence of hepcidin, iron is rapidly mobilized into circulation. Mutations that disrupt the hepcidin/ferroportin signaling axis give rise to iron overload and iron deficiency in mammals, demonstrating that hepcidin and ferroportin are essential for the regulation of systemic iron homeostasis. Our lab has shown that the transcription factor, HIF-2?, is a cellular iron sensor and is the master intestinal regulator of apical and basolateral iron transporters. Moreover, HIF-2? is essential for iron absorption following iron deficiency, the hyperabsorption of iron that leads to tissue iron accumulation during iron overload, and for efficient erythropoiesis. However, it is currently unknown whether the systemic iron regulator, hepcidin, and the intestinal iron regulator, HIF-2?, integrate on the molecular level to maintain organism level iron homeostasis. Using a novel genetic mouse model that allows for tamoxifen-inducible deletion of hepatic hepcidin, our data shows that temporal loss of hepcidin increases intestinal HIF-2? activity and the expression of HIF-2?-specific intestinal iron transporters. Ferroportin is the only known target of hepcidin. To further address this crosstalk, we have also begun to investigate the mechanism by which hepcidin initiates the internalization and degradation of ferroportin, which remains unknown. Our preliminary data shows that, once ubiquitinated and internalized, ferroportin is trafficked to the lysosome independent of canonical macroautophagic machinery. Using a cell based immunoprecipitation approach coupled to mass spectrometry, we identified and confirmed that heat shock 70 kDa protein 8 (HSC70) interacts with ferroportin. HSC70 is the rate limiting cargo protein involved in a process of selective lysosomal degradation that is discrete from macroautophagy, known as chaperone-mediated autophagy. This research proposal will test the hypothesis that rapid activation of intestinal HIF-2? by increased systemic iron demand is mediated by the hepcidin/ferroportin degradation axis in the intestine. This hypothesis will be tested through two interconnected specific aims: (1) Determine the requirement for ferroportin-mediated iron flux in intestinal HIF-2? regulation by hepcidin. (2) Characterize the molecular mechanisms of hepcidin-mediated ferroportin degradation. The proposed studies will unveil the mechanisms by which the liver and the intestine communicate to maintain systemic iron homeostasis, which is essential for the understanding and treatment of iron-related disorders."
"9470066","Project Summary/Abstract Colorectal cancer (CRC) is among the leading types of cancer in men and women. One of the processes commonly dysregulated in cancer is proteolysis: key proteases play pro-oncogenic roles, often in a tissue-specific manner. Consequently, identifying and characterizing proteases critical for oncogenesis provides new opportunities to combat cancer. Through in silico and histological analysis, we identified TMPRSS13 to be markedly upregulated in CRC. TMPRSS13 is a Type II Transmembrane Serine Protease that is largely uncharacterized, with no physiological substrates identified and no cancer-related findings reported thus far. Preliminary work suggests that siRNA-mediated silencing of TMPRSS13 impairs cellular proliferation, and promotes apoptosis. Importantly, TMPRSS13 leads to a decrease in expression of claudin-2, a tight junction protein that has been implicated in increased CRC tumorigenicity and resistance to the chemotherapeutic agent 5-FU. We hypothesize that TMPRSS13 promotes cancer cell survival and CRC progression via regulation of the tight junction protein claudin-2. To test this hypothesis and to pinpoint the molecular mechanisms underlying the function of TMPRSS13 in CRC, in vitro and in vivo studies will be conducted. I will build upon my preliminary findings using various CRC cell lines to determine how TMPRSS13 regulates claudin-2 to aid pro-oncogenic processes such as proliferation, invasion, and escape from apoptosis. Mechanistic data describing the role of TMPRSS13 on claudin-2 and CRC from cell culture models will be complemented by in vivo studies, where I will use a chemically induced model of colon cancer in TMPRSS13 knockout mice to assess the impact of TMPRSS13 on colon tumor growth and progression in vivo and ex vivo. Collectively, these experiments will provide mechanistic information regarding the steps regulated by TMPRSS13 in CRC development and progression. In characterizing TMPRSS13 as a mediator of CRC, our proposed work will provide novel insight into a potential cancer-specific drug target for CRC therapy."
"9354200","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Rationale: Development of dynamic hyperinflation is a primary limiting factor of exercise tolerance in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). To lessen the development of dynamic hyperinflation, and to improve exercise tolerance in COPD patients, we have developed a breathing- retraining technique to be used during pulmonary rehabilitation. This breathing-retraining technique is designed to decrease respiratory rate and prolong exhalation. We demonstrated that, in the short- term, hyperinflation and exercise duration improved more with breathing-retraining plus exercise- training than with exercise-training alone. Because a crucial aspect of pulmonary rehabilitation is the maintenance its short-term benefits over the long-term, we now propose to test whether short- term benefits of breathing-retraining plus exercise followed by an adherence-intervention program are sustainable over the long-term Primary Hypothesis: (H1) In COPD patients, improvements in exercise duration on a constant- load treadmill test will be greater after 12 weeks of breathing- retraining plus exercise-training followed by a 42-week adherence-intervention program (1 yr. total) than after 12 weeks of exercise-training alone followed by a 42-week adherence-intervention program (1 yr. total). Secondary Hypotheses: One year after randomization, exercise-induced dynamic hyperinflation will be less during a constant-load treadmill test (H2), 6-minute walking distance will be longer (H3), and mastery over breathing will be greater (H4) in the breathing- retraining plus exercise-training group than in the exercise-alone group. Lastly (exploratory objective), we will assess the effect of the patient's physiologic, psychologic and clinical phenotype on short-term and long-term responsiveness to pulmonary rehabilitation. Methods: The proposed study is a randomized, controlled clinical trial in which 250 patients with moderate-to-severe COPD will be enrolled. One hundred forty of these patients are expected to qualify for randomization into the breathing-retraining plus exercise-training group or the exercise-training alone group. Patients will receive 12-weeks of supervised training according to group assignment (three times weekly) followed by an adherence-intervention program (weekly phone motivational interviews, home-exercise program, and monthly laboratory booster sessions). Follow-up testing will be completed at 12 weeks, and at 6 and 12 months. Testing will include pulmonary function test, incremental-load and constant-load treadmill tests, 6-minute walk test, measurements of dyspnea, assessment of respiratory and quadriceps muscle strength and endurance and quadriceps ultrasonography. Analysis: In the principal analysis of the primary outcome measure (exercise duration; H1) we will compare changes in exercise duration (constant work-rate treadmill test) from baseline to end of study using 2-sample t-test (two-tailed ?=.05). The primary analysis will be based on intention-to-treat principles. Multiple imputation will be used for study subjects missing the 12-month measurement. This imputation model will be based on baseline characteristics of study participants. Several secondary analyses of the primary outcome measure will be performed (H2-H4). Linear regression will be used to determine whether the observed treatment benefits persist after adjustment for baseline covariates and measures of adherence to treatment. Since several measurements will be taken on each patient, mixed-models analysis will be used to compare the changes on the constant- load treadmill test over time between the two groups."

"9397977","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     The peripheral visual field is largely unexplored to our current method of clinical testing, static threshold automated perimetry. Until the advent of computerized perimetry (quantitation of the visual field) 35 years ago, clinical practice was to test the full visual field manually by kinetic (moving target) Goldmann perimetry. With the evolution to computerized static perimetry, the focus shifted to the central 30°. This seldom tested area, outside the central visual field, represents over 3 times the territory currently evaluated. This is important because the peripheral field is critical for navigation of the environment (functional vision), can be the earlest site of visual field defects, may be the most appropriate territory to follow patients needing changes in intervention and gives a more detailed and full evaluation of vision.  Our pilot data shows that advances in knowledge from our past Merit Reviews coupled with new methodology will now allow us to develop testing of the full visual field using static stimuli in a time-efficint precise and accurate way. This will give a comprehensive assessment of the visual field.  Main Hypothesis: Using larger perimetric stimuli in the peripheral visual field along with a Bayesian testing strategy will allow an efficient, accurate and precise perimetry method so that testing of the full visual field is practical and produces an improved assessment of vision.  Specific Aim 1. Characterize the location of far peripheral visual field defects of optic neuropathies to static stimuli. We will test the full visual field in 120 stable glaucoma and idiopathic intracranial hypertension subjects with a broad range of optic nerve damage to determine where defects occur in the far peripheral visual field to static automated testing. Specific Aim 2. Develop a Bayesian strategy to test the full visual field in less than 10 minutes per eye. We will develop a pattern of test locations in the central and peripheral field based on where visual field defects most often occur. By only using stimulus sizes and intensities that give excellent repeatability, a Bayesian test strategy, and results from frequency of seeing curves, we will develop a new perimetry test. Specific Aim 3. Validate the full visual field testing using the new Bayesian strategy perimetry test. Sixty healthy observers will be tested twice and normative limits for the new test calculated. The 120 optic neuropathy subjects will be retested and the results compared. Specific Aim 4. Correlation of structure of the retinal nerve fiber layer and function (perimetry) using Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) with the full visual field will provide stronger correlations than only the central visual field.  We expect to find visual field defects i the peripheral visual field in cases where central visual field testing is normal and develop a tes that will give a better assessment of visual function. This will allow more accurate results leadin to earlier detection of diseases like glaucoma, earlier disease intervention and better structure / function correlations. Improved test precision will lead to lower retest variability and earlier detection of visual field change. Also, with cases of moderate to severe visual loss, evaluation of the full visual field will provide a larger area to monitor for changes in vision. Lastly, using lager stimuli will lead to almost a doubling of the effective dynamic range of the test that will lead to better assessment of veterans with poor vision. These test attributes should allow improved functional visual assessment for veterans with glaucoma and other optic neuropathies and improved outcome measures for VA rehabilitation research protocols."
"9470327","Project Summary/Abstract The death of sensory hair cells in the inner ear causes irreversible hearing loss and balance deficits in humans and other mammals. In non-mammalian vertebrates, hair cell death elicits a regenerative response in neighboring supporting cells which can include both proliferation and differentiation into replacement hair cells. These repair processes are observed in mammals at early developmental stages, yet decline during maturation (e.g. the first postnatal week in mice). The cause of this reduction in supporting cell regenerative responses remains undefined. A better understanding of the signals controlling supporting cell proliferation will aid efforts to identify the limitations of hair cell regeneration in mammals, and ultimately could lead to therapies that restore sensory function. Supporting cell shape changes are an early event in the regenerative response associated with proliferation (Cotanche 1987; Meyers et al. 2007), and mechanical signals are now recognized as a key mediator of cell behavior. This leads to the hypothesis that mechanical signals arising from cell loss stimulate regenerative proliferation in supporting cells. This project has three aims to test hypothesized ?triggers? and ?brakes? of sensory hair cell regeneration related to mechanical signaling. The first investigates mechanosensory pathways with well-established roles in tissue regeneration that remain relatively unexplored in the inner ear. The second aim tests whether the signals that initiate proliferation are specific to the loss of hair cells, or rather are more general cues related to loss of other cell types in the sensory epithelium. The final aim is to identify proteins that impart unique thickness and stability to the apical F-actin belts of mature mammalian supporting cells, which are hypothesized to limit hair cell regeneration in mammals."
"9469872","Project Summary  Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) is the most common inherited monogenic cause of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) or intellectual disability (ID). In human, FXS is caused by silencing of the FMR1 gene, which leads to a loss of the Fragile X Mental Retardation Protein (FMRP). FXS patients exhibit severe deficits in attention and executive functioning, as well as alterations in neural activity in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), which subserves these functions. FXS patients also have abnormal prefrontal morphology that associates with impairments in behaviors supported by PFC functioning. To date, all pharmacological intervention strategies that have been successful in reversing FXS-relevant phenotypes in mice have not proven to be effective in human clinical trials. Rats offer several advantages over mice for probing mechanistic impairments associated with FXS. Rats exhibit much more complex behaviors than mice, readily learn PFC-dependent tasks, have larger brains which facilitate in vivo electrophysiology and imaging, and have PFC anatomical connectivity and functional homology that has been studied extensively. Thus, we will use the Fmr1-deficient rat model of FXS in this study, which will expand our understanding of the role of FMRP in PFC function and provide a superior platform for treatment development targeting PFC function in FXS. Furthermore, this project will use both male and female Fmr1 knockout (KO) rats in order to elucidate potential sex differences, as well as heterozygous females in order to study the dose-dependent effect of Fmrp. Our preliminary data show that Fmr1-deficient rats have impaired sustained attention, which parallels the attentional phenotype observed in humans. We hypothesize that aberrant oscillatory activity in prefrontal neural circuits is an important neurobiological consequence of Fmrp loss that follows from disrupted morphology in this region and underlies behavioral deficits in attention. In this proposal, we will address the anatomical and functional mechanisms by which loss of Fmrp affects attention in Fmr1-deficient rats. Because the PFC likely also underlies cognitive dysfunction in FXS patients, by elucidating the physiological and morphological abnormalities in the Fmrp-deficient rat PFC, these studies will lay the groundwork for identifying a new target region for treatment. Moreover, as much of the phenotype and many of the neural abnormalities associated with FXS are shared in a subset of individuals with idiopathic ASD and ID, clarifying the neural correlates of attention dysfunction in FXS may also deepen our understanding of ASD and ID and lead to new treatment opportunities for ASD and ID broadly."
"9395386","PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT The process of cellular differentiation hinges on well-coordinated and regulated gene expression, and at the heart of this developmental process is transcriptional control. Missteps in transcription regulation result in many human diseases, including cancers and developmental disorders. The more information we gain about transcription regulation during differentiation, the clearer it becomes that this process is quite complex. For example, specialized regulatory regions, called enhancers, have been proposed as the primary determinant of cell type?specific gene expression . Non-coding RNA transcripts, such as eRNA, are speculated to be involved in the activation of some target genes. Additionally, transcription elongation and other post-initiation events, such as promoter-proximal pausing, are emerging as crucial regulatory steps in the transcriptional control of gene expression patterns. Yet, studies of gene expression patterns during differentiation have often focused on transcription initiation; and the stage-specific function of regulatory regions, such as enhancers, has not been well investigated over the course of differentiation into a specific lineage. Therefore, there is a significant lack of knowledge about the temporal relationship between regulatory regions, non-coding RNAs, and post-initiation transcriptional events and consequently how protein-encoding genes are expressed during differentiation. A critical first step to understanding how the genome regulates itself during differentiation is to clarify the relationship between transcriptional events and chromatin accessibility. We propose using a new high- resolution technology, native elongating transcript sequencing (NET-seq), ? coupled with DNase-seq ? to simultaneously map transcription and regions of open chromatin, and to study erythrocyte differentiation proceeding from human adult hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells to definitive erythroblasts in order to establish a temporal relationship between transcriptional events during differentiation. NET-seq interrogates the 3' ends of nascent RNA, providing a direct visualization of active gene transcription one nucleotide at a time. Additionally, erythropoiesis is an ideal system for studying temporal relationships between transcriptional events during differentiation as many enhancers involved in erythropoiesis show a delay between accessibility and transcribing target genes. However, there has not been systematic analysis coupling transcription elongation events and the chromatin landscape during erythropoiesis. Through this research, we expect to see novel aspects of transcription elongation during erythropoiesis that have not been previously observed. Thus, expanding our understanding of transcriptional control during development beyond events occurring at gene promoters and clarifying how inaccuracies in transcription regulation result in blood cancers and other associated diseases; as well as putting us one step closer to understanding how the genome regulates itself during differentiation."

"9469138","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease that will affect 1 in 8 women throughout their lifetime. It can be divided into clinically relevant subtypes that can be therapeutically targeted with drugs inhibiting the actions of estrogen receptors, progesterone receptors and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2. Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) comprises 14-20% of all breast cancers and is the subtype with the worst prognosis due to the lack of the aforementioned therapeutic targets. According to gene expression data, TNBC can be further divided into two major subtypes: basal-like and a more stem-like/mesenchymal subtype known as claudin-low. While they are molecularly distinct, neither of the primary TNBC subtypes have been effectively therapeutically targeted in the clinic. Hence, discerning the mechanisms driving TNBC progression is necessary to develop therapies for these diseases. I propose elucidating the epigenetic modifications that convey altered transcriptomes in TNBCs as a means to identify drivers of malignancy. One such epigenetic mechanism is a specialized type of enhancer called a super-enhancer (SE). These are large continuous clusters of typical enhancer sequences within DNA that have the ability to activate and sustain the expression of cell identity genes and oncogenes via interactions with transcription factors, co-factors, and epigenetic histone modifiers. While changes in the global transcriptomes of TNBC have previously been reported, these studies have been unable to directly reveal true drivers versus genes whose expression is changed as a result of the transformation process. I propose that discovering the SEs, and their cognate genes, within the breast cancer subtypes would reveal essential genes whose expression must be maintained to sustain TNBC aggressiveness. Using TNBC cell lines, I have already defined SE landscapes for the basal and claudin-low subtypes. In Aim 1, I will determine if the SEs identified in vitro are recapitulated in patient derived xenografts (PDX). SEs that are conserved in vitro and in vivo will provide a core set of SEs for TNBC. In Aim 2, following the PDX analysis, I will disrupt candidate SEs from this core set in cell lines to test their impact on the cancer phenotypes of migration and invasion in vitro. In Aim 3, I will test the in vivo function of selected SEs by evaluating the ability of the SE-disrupted cell lines to form tumors and metastasize in mice. This approach should reveal key genes essential for the maintenance and progression of TNBC. In addition, it should uncover the genes/proteins that would be prime targets for future therapeutic intervention in this disease."
"9464749","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD) is a debilitating psychiatric illness with a complex etiology. Studies in humans have identified hyperactivity of corticostriatal circuits in patients with OCD. Furthermore, twin and family studies show a significant role for genetics in the etiology of OCD, with multiple studies identifying association of polymorphisms in the gene SLC1A1 with OCD. The most common of these OCD- associated polymorphisms increases expression of the encoded protein ? the neuronal glutamate transporter, excitatory amino acid transporter-3 (EAAT3). This OCD-linked allele is associated with increased SLC1A1 expression in lymphoblastoid cells, human postmortem brain, a luciferase reporter assay, and transfected HEK cells, where there is also a functional increase in EAAT3 protein activity, as evidenced by increased glutamate uptake. There is also increased EAAT3 protein expression in striatum of Sapap3-knockout (KO) mice, a model of OCD-like behavior. These results suggest that increased SLC1A1 expression may result in increased generation of abnormal repetitive behaviors, and lead to the prediction that reducing EAAT3 may reduce compulsive behavior. Indeed, Slc1a1-STOP knock-in mice that have ablated EAAT3 protein expression and function show blunted responses during pharmacologically-induced repetitive behavior. Specifically, these mice have attenuated increases in stereotypy and hyperlocomotion in response to amphetamine, and attenuated grooming increases in response to a dopamine D1 receptor agonist. In addition, preliminary data indicate that a specific EAAT3 inhibitor (EAAT3i) can reduce compulsive-like behavior. Chronic EAAT3i administration reduced amphetamine-induced hyperlocomotion, and acute administration decreased grooming in a mouse model of autism-like behavior. However, the role of EAAT3 in OCD-like behavior and associated corticostriatal circuit activity has not been studied. I will therefore use advanced neuroscience tools to determine if chronic ablation and/or acute inhibition of EAAT3 normalizes behavior and striatal activity in a mouse model of OCD-like behavior, and directly test whether EAAT3 overexpression causes OCD-like behavior. My overarching hypothesis is that EAAT3 is necessary and sufficient for the development and expression of OCD-like behavior in mice."
"9567848","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Restoring vision loss in patients with retinal degenerative disorders, such as age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and retinitis pigmentosa (RD) is a goal of many researchers, who are using different therapeutic strategies, including retinal prosthetic implants, optogenetics, stem cell treatments, and gene therapy. A novel approach is the use of a pharmacological agent that acts on synaptic receptors to facilitate transmission of residual, visual signals in the degenerate retina. This approach has not been considered previously. However, recently I discovered that when a GABAc receptor antagonist (TPMPA) is applied to the retina of a P23H rat (model of retinitis pigmentosa), retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) became more sensitive to a light stimulus. The working hypothesis is that there is an increase in tonic inhibition at the axon terminals of bipolar cells in the degenerate retina, and this increased inhibition impedes transmission of photoreceptor signals to RGCs. An alternative to blocking GABAergic receptors on axon terminals of bipolar cells is to block the release of GABA onto the terminals. The metabotropic glutamate type 1 (mGlu1) receptor is reported to modulate GABA release onto bipolar cell axon terminals. I found that the mGlu1 receptor antagonist JNJ16259685 also increased light sensitivity of RGCs in the P23H rat retina. In the proposed study, I plan to follow up on these observations by further evaluating the effects of these receptor antagonists on the receptive field properties of P23H rat RGCs, and to validate these findings in another animal model of retinal degeneration. There are three specific aims in this proposed project. Each specific aim will entail the recording of light responses from RGCs with multielectrode arrays. Aim 1 will examine the effects of blocking GABAc receptors on the receptive field properties of P23H rat RGCs, and Aim 2 will examine the effects of blocking mGlu1 receptors. Aim 3 will determine whether the effects of the GABAc and mGlu1 receptor blockers are reproducible in another model of retinal degeneration (the rd10 mouse). The findings will provide important information on how these neurotransmitter receptor antagonists may alter visual perception in patients with retinal degeneration."

"9394727","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a slowly progressing multifactorial disease involving genetic ab- normalities and environmental insults. AMD is the leading cause of blindness for Americans over age sixty. As the population ages, the prevalence of AMD will continue to grow, reaching a maximum risk rate of ~30% at age 75. Since smoking significantly increases the risk of AMD and there is a 20% higher incidence of smoking in veterans than in the general U.S. adult civilian population, the VA system will have to provide care for poten- tially up to 7 millio or more AMD cases. Current available treatments focus on the late stage of the disease (choroidal neovascularization; CNV); however, those come with significant risks and only target subpopulations of AMD patients. No treatment is available for early AMD (>85% of all cases). Thus it is paramount that we learn on how to detect AMD early and develop treatments that allow for early disease prevention. While mech- anistic studies have shown that inflammation and smoking are fundamental components of both forms of AMD, genetic studies have demonstrated that polymorphisms in different complement proteins each increase the risk for developing AMD. One of the most detrimental mutations occurs in factor H (fH) an essential inhibitor in the alternative pathway (AP) of the complement cascade. Overall, it has been hypothesized that inadequate con- trol of complement-driven inflammation may be a major factor in disease pathogenesis in AMD. A recent clini- cal trial (Genentech; lampalizumab blocking an activator of the AP), supports the hypothesis that the AP is a critical target in AMD. We have established that complement, and in particular AP activity is involved in differ- ent mouse models of AMD, including smoke-induced ocular pathology and laser-induced CNV. Finally, we have generated a targetable CFH, CR2-fH. CR2-fH uses the Complement Receptor 2 domain to specifically target factor H to sites of complement activation. The CR2 domain ensures targeting to membranes without relying on the endogenous ligand-binding domains present in CFH that harbor some of the genetic mutations. We have demonstrated efficacy in vitro and in vivo for reducing AP-dependent pathology using CR2-fH. One of the limitations of protein-based therapeutics is delivery. For short-term treatments, intravitreal injections are used for long-term treatments, other avenues need to be explored. Here we wish to test two therapeutic strat- egies in models of AMD: delivery of CR2-fH using AAV vector therapy using both preventative and therapeutic applications. Here we will be guided by our overall hypothesis that pathologic activation of the AP of comple- ment injures the RPE, and ultimately leads to the development of AMD. We further hypothesize that long-term delivery of the alternative pathway inhibitor CFH will provide an effective therapy for AMD."
"9395514","Project Summary/Abstract The central dogma of molecular biology provides an account of the mechanisms by which genetic information in the form of DNA is accurately and reliably decoded into a sequence of amino acids forming the basis of virtually all cellular processes. The primary mechanisms involved in the central dogma are transcription; the transfer of information from DNA to RNA, and translation; the synthesis of a polypeptide based on the information in messenger RNA (mRNA). Transfer RNA (tRNA) play a key role in translation, providing correct amino acids to the ribosome for addition to the nascent polypeptide by specific base-pairing with a nucleotide triplet in the mRNA sequence. The rate of translation is therefore dependent (in addition to other factors) on the availability of specific, charged (amino acid carrying) tRNAs. Thus, regulation of tRNA abundance and/or charging represent ideal points of regulation of protein synthesis, a conserved, fundamental genetic mechanism. In addition to the canonical function of tRNA in translation, these small RNA molecules have been demonstrated to regulate other processes through distinct mechanisms. Significantly, the importance of dynamic regulation of tRNAs is currently an area of emerging interest in human pathology and cancer biology. Previous findings have indicated that in response to pathogen infection, plants rapidly accumulate high levels of specific tRNAs. Such changes can be detected by traditional hybridization methods, but until very recently sequencing approaches could not be used for analysis of genome-wide changes in tRNA abundance. The high level of resolution needed to accurately distinguish individual tRNAs, which often vary by only a few nucleotides, could not be attained due to the high levels of posttranscriptional modification and complex secondary structure of mature tRNA molecules. In just the past year, a novel approach applied in mammalian systems has successfully overcome these problems. This has presented the opportunity to adapt these methods in order to perform the first ever high resolution analysis of a plant ?tRNAome? as a means of further exploring the function of differential accumulation of specific tRNAs in plant immune responses. The abundance and charging of tRNA during the induced immune response in Arabidopsis will be examined in this study through a combination of biochemical and next-generation sequencing techniques. This will be carried out in conjunction with complementary genome-wide transcriptional and translational studies currently underway in the laboratory, allowing for comparative analysis of output from multiple genetic mechanisms. In parallel, this study will characterize the functional role of a novel regulator of plant immunity that was identified in a mutant screen for translational de-regulation and has potential links to tRNA function. This work is anticipated to provide a comprehensive analysis of the dynamics and function of tRNA in rapid plant immune response."
"9331063","PROJECT SUMMARY The human microbiome, or the collection of microorganisms that inhabits the human body, plays an important role in wide-ranging aspects of human health and disease, including conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease, diabetes, psoriasis, childhood asthma, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. There has been growing interest in studying the microbiome across time either to assess its stability or to characterize changes associated with disease onset, progression, or treatment. However, few statistical methods exist for analysis of microbiome data from longitudinal studies (i.e., studies that track individuals across time). Therefore, there is a growing need for rigorous statistical methods to analyze longitudinal microbiome data. The proposed research will address this need in the context of two types of questions: whether changes in microbiome composition as a whole are associated with an outcome, and how we can use multiple measurements on an individual to discover which taxa are associated with the outcome. To address the first question, a community-level test of association between the entire microbiome and an outcome will be developed within the nonparametric kernel machine regression framework. The kernel, which summarizes the relationship between microbiome and outcome, will be based on a novel measure of distance that incorporates phylogenetic information and summarizes the extent of change within and between individuals. For the second question, variable selection techniques will be used with generalized estimating equations to account for correlation between repeated measurements on the same set of individuals. This will result in small models that include only the taxa that are relevant to the outcome. Because information may be gained by grouping taxa based on phylogenetic or functional relationships, in addition to selecting individual taxa this method will allow selection among pre-defined groups of taxa. In combination, these two methods will enable powerful and robust inference of relationships between the microbiome and health outcomes in longitudinal studies. To demonstrate the utility of these methods, we will apply them to a longitudinal study of graft-versus-host disease. Because they use all of the data collected across time and incorporate phylogenetic and/or functional relationships between taxa, these methods will allow detection of novel relationships between graft-versus-host disease and microbial communities or specific taxa. !"
"9333116","Objectives: Difficulty retrieving the right word to communicate a message is the most common complaint in healthy older adults and individuals with stroke-induced language impairment (i.e., aphasia). Novel word learning paradigms have been used to investigate a variety of behavioral and neuromodulatory approaches to improve word retrieval deficits. Previous novel word learning studies have shown that physical exercise can improve long term recall in healthy young adults and that increased levels of dopamine may be responsible for this effect; however, no studies have investigated the effects of exercise on novel word learning in older adults and individuals with aphasia, and very little is known about the mechanisms that support exercise-enhanced word learning in these populations. The aims of this SPiRE are to: 1) to identify the novel word learning paradigm that facilitates immediate and long-term word recall; 2a) to investigate how acute, moderate-intensity exercise alters levels of serum brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and plasma dopamine; and 2b) to describe and quantify the association between novel word learning and any observed changes in serum BDNF and plasma dopamine. This research will provide a platform for future investigations of immediate exercise effects on word learning, which are essential for achieving our long-term goal of developing exercise-based word retrieval interventions for healthy older veterans and veterans with aphasia. Methods: A within subjects crossover design will be used to address Aims 1, 2a and 2b. Subjects will complete aerobic exercise or stretching (training) before engaging in Study Only or Retrieval Practice (learning). Subjects will be counterbalanced within and across conditions. Twelve healthy older veterans and 12 veterans with aphasia, age 65-89 years, will be recruited. The study will comprise 18 sessions over 12 weeks. In Week 1, subjects will undergo baseline blood draws, a physical assessment, cognitive and language assessments, and a practice word learning task. In Weeks 2-12, subjects will complete the four conditions. Each condition will last two weeks, with a one-week break between conditions. In each condition, training and learning sessions will take place on Monday, Wednesday and Friday. Training: Subjects will engage in 30 minutes of moderate-intensity cycling or gentle upper and lower limb stretching (control) prior to engaging in a novel word learning task. Learning: Familiar objects (e.g., cup) will be paired with nonwords (e.g., flark). In the Study Only paradigm, object/nonword pairs will be presented three times across three days (Monday, Wednesday, Friday). In the Retrieval Practice paradigm, object/nonword pairs will be presented during the first session (Monday). In subsequent sessions (Wednesday, Friday), subjects will be asked to recall the nonword name of presented objects. Corrective feedback will be provided on each trial. Testing: Recognition and recall testing without corrective feedback will be administered immediately after learning (short-term memory), before training in the second and third learning session (overnight consolidation) and one week after learning (long-term memory). Blood Draws: Three blood samples will be taken at baseline (rest, 30 minutes, 60 minutes). In each of the four conditions, blood samples will be taking during the first and third learning session (at rest, after training, and after learning). Whole blood will be collected in plain tubes and in anticoagulant-treated tubes for subsequent serum BDNF and plasma dopamine analysis by ELISA. Samples will be analyzed in triplicate to increase reliability. To address Aim 1, we will use a mixed effects model approach to fit repeated measures ANOVAs to word recall scores at after learning (immediate recall) and one week later (long-term recall). To address Aim 2a, we will use a mixed effects model approach to fit repeated measures ANOVA to serum BDNF and plasma dopamine levels obtained at rest, after 30 minutes and 60 minutes at baseline and during training sessions on Monday and Friday. To address Aim2b, we will use a mixed effects model approach to fit ANCOVA mediator analyses to investigate the association between neurophysiological changes (BDNF, dopamine) on word recall (immediate, long-term)."

"9470061","Reversible exit from the cell cycle, or cellular quiescence, is a feature of both normal and cancer stem cells. Quiescent adult stem cells are critical for tissue maintenance and stress response. In contrast, quiescent cancer stem cells are a cause of tumor recurrence, as these cells are able to resist chemotherapy that targets actively dividing cells.Therefore, understanding basic features of stem cell biology and identifying novel therapeutic targets for quiescent cancer cells are of great clinical interest. Caenorhabditis elegans has proven to be a powerful model to investigate pathways involved in the maintenance of long term arrest. In unfavorable conditions, C. elegans larvae enter a long-lived state, known as dauer, in which cells remain quiescent and multipotent for months at a time?several times the normal lifespan of the animal. Entry into the dauer state is associated with blocks to Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) signal transduction. The C. elegans Vulval Precursor Cells (VPCs) have long been used to study mechanisms regulating cell fate decisions and this tractable system is subject to dauer induced arrest. This project aims to use VPCs to identify fundamental mechanisms by which conserved signaling pathways block the EGFR pathway in quiescent and multipotent cells by 1) determining the level at which EGFR signaling is regulated in dauer 2) removing putative negative regulators in order to induce VPC division and differentiation during dauer 3) using in vivo fluorescent kinase reporters to determine if stereotyped signaling dynamics characterize dauer arrest. These aims will identify crosstalk between signaling cascades and provide a model for the regulation mechanism associated with long term maintenance of quiescence."
"9326722","Abstract One in eight women in the United States will develop invasive breast cancer, with approximately 40% of patients positive for disseminated tumor cells (DTC) in the bone at time of diagnosis. However, it is not yet possible to predict whether these DTC in the bone will form overt metastasis that are more likely to be resistant to current therapies and comprised of cancer stem cells or if these DTC will remain indolent. The role of two niches, the endosteal and perivascular niches, within the bone marrow are thought to influence DTC migration and behavior. Recent studies have highlighted the role of the integrin alpha-v-beta-3 (?v?3) as a marker that is uniquely upregulated in bone metastasis compared to both the primary tumor and other soft tissue metastasis, and may be indicative of metastatic potential. The specific aims of this project are to: 1) Develop and characterize a 3D in vitro model of bone marrow stroma that includes both the vascular niche and the endosteal niche; and, 2) Examine breast cancer cell trafficking and upregulation of ?v?3 within a specific niche. The research plan will enable the applicant to develop a new microfluidic platform, complimenting her background as a bioengineer, while enabling her to apply the technology to biologically relevant questions regarding cancer biology and metastasis with high spatial and temporal resolution. In addition, the fellowship application includes a training plan that leverages the rich research environment at Washington University in St. Louis outside of the lab to ensure the development of a broad set of skills necessary for a successful independent research career. The completion of the specific aims and training plan will provide the field with a new tool to study the first steps of metastasis and a new independent investigator prepared to address a broad range of unanswered and impactful questions that impact our understanding and treatment of cancer."
"9567943","After spinal cord injury (SCI), particularly cervical and high thoracic injuries, the motor, sensory, and sympathetic pathways necessary for effective thermoregulation are interrupted, resulting in an impaired ability to maintain core body temperature (Tcore) when exposed to challenges in environmental temperature. Control of distal extremity vasoconstriction (heat conservation) and shivering thermogenesis (heat production) are impaired, and the ability to maintain a constant Tcore is compromised. In addition, changes in body composition (loss of lean body mass) and medications commonly prescribed in persons with SCI may lower metabolic rate and further depress Tcore. Persons with tetraplegia often report ?feeling cold,? frequently present with subnormal Tcore (35.5-36.5°C), and are particularly vulnerable to hypothermia (Tcore<35°C), even at temperatures that are comfortable for able-bodied (AB) individuals. The deleterious effects of hypothermia are well appreciated in AB persons with documented progressive decline in various aspects of cognitive performance associated with the magnitude of the depression in Tcore. However, the potential beneficial effects of increasing subnormal Tcore to euthermic levels on cognitive function of those with tetraplegia are not known. In our current submission, we are proposing a prospective two-group comparative study to compare the physiological and cognitive responses to warm exposure in persons with SCI who have subnormal Tcore and in AB persons who are euthermic. Twenty subjects with SCI (C3-T4, AIS A & B; Tcore <37°C) and 20 age/gender-matched AB control subjects will be recruited for study. Subjects will be placed in a thermoneutral (27°C) environment for instrumentation. Measurements of Tcore (rectal thermocouple), skin temperature (skin thermocouple), sweat rate (QSweat methodology), and thermal sensitivity (9-point thermal sensation scale) will be made during 15 minutes of baseline (27°C) and during up to 120 minutes of warm (35°C) temperature exposure while in the seated position. Cognitive performance will be assessed twice, at baseline and after Tcore rises 0.5°C or at the end of the warm challenge. The primary dependent variables will be Tcore and cognitive performance. The secondary dependent variables will be measures of autonomic adaption to a warm environment and include distal skin temperature, sweat rate, and thermal sensitivity. Specific Aims: During exposure to a warm environment (35°C) for up to 120 min in the seated position: Primary Specific Aim: To determine if 2 hours of warm exposure will cause a 0.5°C increase in Tcore and favorably effect cognitive performance (attention, working memory, processing speed, and executive function). Primary Hypotheses: Based on our pilot data: (1) Eighty percent of persons with tetraplegia will demonstrate an increase of 0.5°C in Tcore while none of the AB controls will demonstrate such an increase in Tcore; (2) Eighty percent of persons with tetraplegia will have an increase of at least one T-score in Stroop Interference scores (a validated measure of executive function) while none of the AB controls will demonstrate a change in cognitive performance. Secondary Specific Aims: To determine changes in: (1) The average of distal skin temperatures; (2) Sweat rate; and (3) Subjective rating of thermal sensitivity. Secondary Hypotheses: Persons with tetraplegia will have less of a percent change in average distal skin temperatures and sweat rate, and will report blunted ratings of thermal sensitivity compared to that of AB controls. Our proposed study will confirm our preliminary observations in persons with SCI who have subnormal Tcore to demonstrate in a more definitive manner that cognitive function will be improved by raising Tcore to normal. By rapidly and dramatically reversing the impairment in cognitive function by raising Tcore about 0.5°C to euthermic values, we would anticipate greater functional capacity and independence, enhanced reintegration into society, and improved quality of life, albeit these endpoints are beyond the scope of the current proposal."
"9395026","Project summary/abstract  The prevalence of autoimmune and allergic diseases is rising. The human antibody isotype IgE plays a central role in the pathogenesis of allergic disease by mediating antigen dependent signals through the IgE Fc- receptors (Fc?RI and Fc?RII). Fc?RI, the high affinity IgE Fc-receptor, binds IgE very tightly (KD <1nmol/L) As a result, mast cells and basophils expressing Fc?RI circulate preloaded with IgE:Fc?RI complexes, poised for activation and degranulation upon antigen encounter. Activation of these cells can induce clinical outcomes ranging from allergic symptoms to anaphylaxis and death.  Omalizumab, an anti-IgE therapeutic monoclonal antibody, has validated IgE as a therapeutic target for allergic disorders. Omalizumab primarily acts as a competitive inhibitor of IgE:Fc?RI interactions, and binds free circulating IgE, often taking weeks to achieve a therapeutic response. In contrast, we have now selected and characterized two Designed Ankyrin Repeat Protein (DARPin) inhibitors, named E2_79 and bi53_79, that are ~1-3 orders of magnitude more efficient than omalizumab at immediately disrupting IgE receptor complexes and suppressing the activation of allergic effector cells. The DARPin bi53_79 is also approximately an order of magnitude more potent than omalizumab at preventing passive cutaneous anaphylaxis in vivo. These new disruptive inhibitors of preformed IgE:Fc?RI complexes are not limited by the slow dissociation of IgE from Fc?RI, and can theoretically disarm mast cells and basophils on contact. Yet, the viability of DARPin based therapies is not clear.  The work in this proposal aims to define the mechanism of the disruptive inhibitors E2_79 and bi53_79, and apply that knowledge to design or identify therapeutically viable antibody-based disruptive inhibitors of IgE:Fc?RI complexes. These agents would serve as a basis for the design of new, more potent anti-IgE drugs, that could potentially be used to suppress acute allergic responses."
"9470242","Summary Ciliopathies are a diverse class of developmental diseases that can manifest as defects in kidney, skeletal, eye, heart, reproductive, or mental function. Many ciliopathies, including Bardet-Biedl, Joubert, and Meckel Gruber Syndromes, are caused by defects in the major protein complexes that characterize the ciliary compartment. At least 1,000 proteins are associated with cilia biogenesis and function; uncovering the principles of ciliary protein organization thus requires a large scale, systematic investigation. Our current human protein complex maps, while extensive, have only moderate coverage of ciliary proteins, warranting the collection of targeted experimental datasets. I will use comparative proteomic analysis of cilia from multiple organisms to determine deeply conserved protein-protein interactions likely to be critical to ciliary function in humans. Examining human biological systems in the context of their level of conservation across species is a productive route to distinguish biological signal from noise. My preliminary data on three ciliated species confirm that this approach is capable of identifying conserved ciliary protein complexes. If a pair of proteins are found in physical contact in diverse species, having survived speciation events and gene loss, it can be predicted that this physical interaction is important. First, using mass spectrometry, we will experimentally detect protein complexes within the cilia across a spectrum of eukaryotic organisms, broadly defining conserved ciliary proteins. Second, we will integrate our own experimental data, some of which we have already collected, with outside data to construct a system-wide map of conserved ciliary protein complexes. These conserved ciliary protein complexes are strongly predicted to be functionally important in humans, and potentially involved in human birth defects. Finally, we will test a targeted subset of proteins predicted to associate with known birth defect proteins in vivo using Xenopus laevis embryos as a model system. We have four candidate genes in hand, and will consider candidates from the prior aims as appropriate. This project will lead to a map of critical conserved ciliary protein complexes, a future primary resource for research into diverse ciliopathies."
"9396768","PROJECT SUMMARY  Women with oral cancer experience more cancer pain than men. Our preliminary analysis of a cohort of 91 oral cancer patients (47 men, 44 women) accrued through the NYU Oral Cancer Center demonstrated a sex difference in self-reported oral cancer pain as measured by the validated UCSF Oral Cancer Pain Questionnaire. However, the etiology of oral cancer pain is unknown. I recently demonstrated a sex difference in the prevalence and severity of oral squamous cell carcinoma (oSCC)-induced pain using the 4- nitroquinoline-1-oxide (4NQO)-induced oral carcinogenesis mouse model. Female mice with oSCC exhibit significantly more pain behavior compared to male mice. Furthermore, using flow cytometry to quantify inflammation and classify immune cell infiltrate, I revealed significant differences in the immune cell infiltrate in the cancer microenvironment of male and female mice. Tongues from male mice with oSCC had a 4-fold increase in infiltrating neutrophils but female mice did not. I hypothesize that infiltrating neutrophils in the cancer microenvironment contribute to the sex differences in oral cancer pain. In support of my hypothesis, I have shown that opioids are expressed by neutrophils isolated from the tongue cancer-induced inflammatory microenvironment in mice. Furthermore, in the presence of tongue cancer-induced inflammation, local naloxone (opioid receptor antagonist) treatment potentiated pain behavior in male mice only. To further test my hypothesis, I will investigate whether abundance of infiltrating neutrophils correlates with oral cancer pain and sex in human patients (Aim 1) as well as determine if manipulation of neutrophil infiltration modifies pain behavior in 4NQO-treated tumor-bearing male mice (Aim 2). In the proposed experiments, I will employ a translational research strategy focused on the neurobiology of oral cancer pain through which I will gain requisite training in oral histopathology, clinical-translational research, as well as selective manipulation of immune infiltrate in a cancer mouse model. The successful completion of the proposed experiments will further my knowledge in the relationship between cancer, associated inflammation, and pain as well as development of the skills that I need to independently pursue clinical-translational research."

"9397362","PROJECT SUMMARY Background: Biological processes emerge from molecular interactions within and between organisms, including hosts and their associated microbiota. Understanding molecular interactions between the host immune system and microbial communities is a major goal of microbiome research. The immune system co- exists with beneficial microbes, while simultaneously identifying and eliminating invaders. Successful interactions between the host immune system and microbiota are essential for maintaining host health, while failed interactions can cause detrimental effects such as human diseases like inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and Crohn's Disease. The microbiota can also influence health phenotypes including obesity and diabetes. Host genetics has been demonstrated to play a role in establishing host immune-microbe relationships and can impact composition of the microbiota. Despite our knowledge of the existence of these relationships, the immune gene variants interacting with the microbiome, particularly in the context of diverse diets and environments, are still unknown. Hypothesis: variation in immune genes, particularly those in the adaptive immune system MAP-kinase pathway, are involved in host ?associated microbial communities. Specific Aims: (1) Use divergent stickleback populations to identify natural genetic variants affecting host- associated microbiome composition, as well host immune gene expression in response to targeted manipulations of the microbiota. (2) Use CRISPR/Cas9 manipulations of key immune genes in divergent threespine stickleback populations to test hypotheses regarding the functional relationship between variation in host immune response and microbiota composition. Study Design: To determine the effects of natural genetic variants associated with variance in microbiota composition, I will raise stickleback families from both freshwater and marine laboratory lines in a single environment. I will then assess variance microbial composition using 16S sequencing. To map natural genetic variants affecting host transcriptional state and microbiome composition, I will use crosses of divergent stickleback populations, measure influences on host immune response, host gene expression, and microbial composition. These data will be combined in QTL/eQTL mapping studies. Finally, to determine how immune system disturbance varies across genetically divergent populations, I will use the CRISPR-Cas9 system to abrogate function of variants and exchange alleles between marine and freshwater populations, then measure outcomes on host immune response, gene expression, and microbial composition. ."
"9468620","PROPOSAL SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Background and Central Hypothesis: Cajal bodies (CBs) are non-membranous nuclear organelles that are responsible for assembling small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs) into functional complexes that can participate in pre-mRNA splicing. Two of the essential proteins of CBs ? coilin and the survival of motor neuron protein (SMN) ? are essential for vertebrate development and for CB integrity. A deficiency of SMN is the underlying cause of spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), a neurodegenerative disease caused by splicing defects, and SMN binds to coilin in the nucleus. Remarkably, the field lacks a mechanistic model for how these proteins participate in CB formation and function. Thus, we must ask whether a deficiency of SMN causes defects in CB formation and consequent failure of the final snRNP assembly steps. Because SMN is involved in early steps of snRNP assembly in the cytoplasm, it is difficult to separate this from its role in the nucleus. Therefore, I propose to study the mechanism of CB assembly by coilin and SMN in vitro. I will complement this with an in vivo study of CB composition and function in neurons and other tissues, using zebrafish as a powerful model system. Specific Aims: In aim 1, I will make use of biophysical techniques to measure the interactions between coilin, SMN, and CB RNA molecules. I have also developed a single molecule microscopy technique for studying the binding affinity and kinetics of these molecules using both bottom-up and top-down assembly. In aim 2, I will use zebrafish as a model organism for studying the effects of a genetic depletion of SMN on the CB interactome. Using wild-type and SMN -/- fish, I will compare two developmental time points using mass spectrometry to identify protein partners and enhanced UV-crosslinking immunoprecipitation and RNA-Seq (CLIP) for RNA partners. I will validate these results with confocal imaging."
"9453242","Project Summary/Abstract Circuit mechanisms underlying evidence accumulation during decision-making Behavior across many types of decision-making is well described by the gradual accumulation of evidence toward one of multiple alternatives. Neuronal correlates of the accumulation of evidence during perceptual decision-making have been observed in many areas in the brain. Recent work in a rat auditory evidence accumulation task has identified a causal role for a number of brain structures, including the frontal cortex, basal ganglia, and the superior colliculus. These structures are highly interconnected to each other, indicating that understanding their interactions is necessary for elucidating the circuit mechanisms underlying decision-making. It is not known whether or how these structures interact with each other during decision-making. This project will address three questions regarding the interactions between structures implicated in decision-making: 1) Are the frontal orienting fields, a rodent prefrontal area, and the superior colliculus functionally independent during evidence accumulation? 2) How is the neural encoding of evidence transformed between the input and output nuclei of the basal ganglia 3) Does the the neural encoding in the frontal orienting fields and the superior colliculus depend on the basal ganglia? This project will address these questions through simultaneous optogenetic perturbation and electrophysiological recording across multiple brain areas. The results this project will likely provide detailed understanding of the neural circuits that support the gradual accumulation of evidence during decision-making."
"9575205","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Neuropathic pain is a chronic condition of heterogeneous symptoms resulting from peripheral and/or central nerve damage characterized by hyperalgesia and allodynia. Tragically, an estimated 60-80% of persons with spinal cord injury (SCI) experience neuropathic pain with 1/3 describing their pain as severe. Although there are currently preclinical models of SCI-induced pain, there have been few successes in translation of new treatment from rodent models to clinical practice, suggesting that development of highly clinically-relevant preclinical model will facilitate discovery and translation of new treatments. Since pigs are very similar to humans in many aspects of physiology and pathophysiology, we hypothesize that a porcine model of SCI- induced neuropathic pain is a much need tool to improve the discovery of new treatments. Thus, we propose to assess and detail the porcine spinal cord neuroanatomy using state-of-the art neuronavigation and anatomical characterizations, as are used in clinical practice. We will also evaluate post-SCI neuropathic pain using procedures that mimic clinical evaluations and include supraspinal responses."
"9573850","Project summary The effective and efficient utilization of the big data accumulated in biomedical sciences, including the genomic, imaging data collected from patients that are often integrated with their electronic health records represents a great opportunity as well as a big challenge for the biomedical data science. Because biomedical data are collected from individual patients, and thus carry identifiable information of the data donors, the projection of their privacy becomes an important concern in large-scale projects including the recently launched Precision Medicine Initiative. In the past few years, significant progresses have been made on cryptographic techniques, including the homomorphic encryption (HME) that enables a direct analysis of encrypted data without decrypting it, and the Secure Multiparty Computing (SMC) that allows two or more organizations to jointly compute a task without exposing to each other?s inputs. Here, based on these techniques, we propose to develop a suite of encryption protocols and open-source software tools that can be used by biomedical researchers in a plug-and-play manner for the statistical analysis of encrypted biomedical data. We note that our methods assume biomedical data will be protected by encryption once they are generated, and the subsequent analysis and sharing will always be performed on the encrypted form, which thus can achieve a high security standard for privacy protection."
"9468753","Project Summary C?H Functionalization is one of the most powerful methods used by nature and chemists alike to construct bioactive molecules. Both natural and synthetic efforts to catalytically transform C?H bonds into other functionalities have focused on restricting the selectivity of each catalyst to one site on each substrate. This specificity allows for the predictable and strategic application of these methods but does not permit flexibility, requiring a redesign of the catalyst, whether enzyme or small molecule, to achieve a different C?H functionalization outcome. It would be highly desirable to be able to predictably and controllably use a single catalyst for several complementary C?H functionalization reactions, obviating the significant effort needed to retool catalyst selectivity and streamlining the synthesis of bioactive molecules.  Recent study in the Gray laboratory has revealed a readily-synthesized iron-nickel cluster to not only be a highly efficient electrocatalyst for the water oxidation reaction but, also, the selective oxidation of C?H bonds. Furthermore, the modulation of applied potential to the system is able to shunt the catalyst between several active states, changing the inherent selectivity of the reaction and permitting tunable selectivity of the C?H functionalization event. Here we propose to develop this means of selectivity into a suite of robust C?H functionalization reactions, specifically C?H oxidation and fluorination, that can be used to enable and improve the development of compounds important to human health."
"9398010","ABSTRACT Background: Sickle cell disease (SCD) is the most common genetic blood disorder in the United States (US) and Jamaica and primarily affects individuals of African descent. SCD can result in severe and debilitating complications, including vaso-occlusive crises and organ damage. To prevent these complications SCD requires complex self-management. SCD is associated with significantly shortened lifespans in both countries; however the average lifespan in Jamaica is 10.5-11 years longer when compared to the US. Many personal and background factors including, perceived stigma, demographics (country, age, race, sex, socioeconomic status) and clinical (disease severity, hydroxyurea use, genotype) characteristics may influence self- management strategies and QoL in SCD. These characteristics have not been explored in either country and there are many differences between countries in how SCD is managed and stigma is perceived. Methods: This cross sectional study will utilize a convergent parallel mixed methods design (individual interviews and self-report surveys). Participants will be interviewed about disease self-management strategies and how sources of stigma influence these strategies. Demographic and clinical characteristics will be assessed using questionnaires. Quantitative measures will be used to assess perceived stigma [SCD Health- Related Stigma Scale (SCD-HRSS)] and QoL [Adult Sickle Cell Quality of Life Measures (ASCQ-Me) emotional impact, pain episodes, pain impact, sleep impact, social functioning impact, and stiffness impact; disease severity]. The specific aims of this study are to: Aim 1: Determine the influence of perceived stigma and demographic and clinical characteristics on SCD self- management and QoL in adults with SCD in the US and Jamaica. Question 1: What are the influences of perceived stigma and demographic and clinical characteristics on SCD self-management? Question 2: What are the influences of perceived stigma and demographic and clinical characteristics on QoL? Aim 2: Describe the relationship between SCD self-management strategies and QoL. Significance: Understanding the relationships between perceived stigma, demographic and clinical characteristics, SCD self-management strategies and QoL in Jamaica and the US will illuminate useful comparisons that could lead to new strategies to improve SCD self-management despite stigma."
"9395961","7. PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Adolescent alcohol use (AU) is of great public health interest because it is associated with acute and long-term negative outcomes such as risky sexual behaviors, illicit drug use, problematic AU later in life, and death. Understanding how adolescents navigate peer contexts is critical to prevention efforts because adolescent AU typically occurs with peers. Social development models posit that interactions between adolescent social goals and parenting style influence how adolescents transact with their social environments, and may protect adolescents from peer contexts that promote AU. A growing body of work suggests that an interpersonal style characterized by valuing and establishing close interpersonal relationships (high communion), while simultaneously being able to articulate opinions to peers (high agency), helps adolescents achieve important developmental milestones (e.g., forming close friendships and independence) while also avoiding engagement in AU. Responsive and demanding parenting is thought to help foster this protective interpersonal style, and successful peer relationships and avoidance of AU involves developmentally appropriate shifts in parenting and social goals. Although it has been repeatedly asserted that social goals and parenting styles operate jointly to curtail the initiation and escalation of adolescent AU in adolescence, and show developmental changes, no work to our knowledge has considered the dynamic interplay between agency, communion, and parental responsiveness and demandingness in the etiology of adolescent AU. This is a notable gap because understanding the joint effects of these adolescent and parenting characteristics may inform potential targets for preventive interventions aimed at mitigating negative peer influences and helping adolescents achieve important developmental tasks of intimacy and autonomy. The proposed study will address this gap in the literature. We propose to (1) identify patterns of adolescent social goals and parenting style using latent profile analysis, (2) evaluate developmental changes in social goals and parenting using latent transition analysis, and (3) examine how these transitions relate to the initiation and escalation of AU from middle to late adolescence as well as DSM 5 Alcohol Use Disorder symptoms in late adolescence. A community sample of 387 families (target child and caregiver) was assessed annually for 7 assessments (91% retention). Adolescents completed measures of parenting and interpersonal goals during the first 3 assessments and they completed measures of AU at all 7 assessments. Results will advance our understanding of how youth adapt to a social context in which risk behavior becomes increasingly common with age, and may provide important intervention opportunities for promoting positive adaptation during adolescence."

"9312131","Currently, over 25 million U.S. citizens have diabetes, including 20% of veterans in the VA system. With diabetes prevalence predicted to rise 35% by 2025, diabetic complications impose an ever-increasing burden on healthcare systems. One of the most common complications, diabetic retinopathy, is the leading cause of blindness in working age adults. In addition, early neuronal dysfunction in diabetic retinopathy occurs prior to clinically diagnosable pathology and is likely intimately related to other diabetic complications, for example, cognitive and motor deficits and microvascular changes in the brain. The continued increase in diabetic patient numbers and the complexity of their care underscores the urgent need to identify the earliest possible window for treatment. Our approach is to identify an earlier time point for intervention and develop clinically translatable treatments to target diabetic complications prior to obvious signs and symptoms. In this study, we will be using the Goto-Kakizaki rat model of Type II diabetes because approximately 90% of diabetic patients in the VA system are Type II. We hypothesize that: 1) early retinal deficits in diabetes will correlate with cerebral deficits and later stage retinal deficits, and 2) identifying the time course of early retinal deficits will allow us to introduce interventions prior to clinically relevant symptoms of diabetic retinopathy as well as cognitive and motor deficits. In the first specific aim, we will identify the temporal appearance of retinal dysfunction, using electroretinography to assess retinal function and optical coherence tomography to assess retinal structure, and test whether these defects correlate with cognitive dysfunction (y ?maze), motor dysfunction (rotarod), and later stage vascular pathology (acellular capillaries and pericyte loss). After determining the time course of these deficits, in the second specific aim, we will identify whether dopamine deficiency is a common mechanism underlying diabetic injury in the brain and retina. We will assess levels of dopamine and DOPAC (HPLC). After we have identified the temporal appearance of dopamine loss, we will implement L-DOPA treatment to reduce dopamine deficiency in diabetic rats. We will determine whether rats receiving treatment exhibit reduced dopamine deficiency and reduced retinal, cognitive, and motor dysfunction. In our third specific aim, we will determine whether exercise reduces dopamine deficiency and prevents the progression of visual and cerebral dysfunction in diabetes. The expected outcome of this study is that treating at the earliest signs of retinopathy in a rodent model of Type II diabetes will provide protection against diabetic damage in the brain and retina. This research can lead to the identification of a similar window for preclinical retinopathy treatment in diabetic patients, which would allow for greater treatment efficacy and prevention of future complications. If exercise and/or treatments that target dopamine protect against retinal and cerebral complications in diabetes, these findings would motivate the development of a human clinical trial. Overall, the motivation for this study is the need for a better understanding of early diabetic retinopathy with the long-term goal of developing treatments that delay or prevent vision loss and other complications in our Veterans and others with diabetes. The Atlanta VA has a large population of diabetic patients and is currently conducting research on the effects of exercise treatment on cognition and Parkinson's disease in VA patients, making this research project an excellent fit for the Center's goals and interests. This research will also provide valuable training to the postdoctoral candidate, which will enable her to become a successful and productive independent investigator in the field of diabetic retinopathy within the VA research environment."
"9468745","RR-7: ABSTRACT One out of every three children under the age of five in India are undernourished (48 million). To address this crisis, Indian government established a National Rural Health Mission (NRHM) program in 2005, which improved healthcare and nutritional services. Unfortunately, this efforts which spanned from 2005 to 2012 have yielded minimal improvement. Persistent child undernutrition limits growth, productivity, quality of life, and life expectancy of Indians. In other words, Indian children are unable to realize their full potential due to undernutrition.  Our current understanding of child undernutrition in India is 1) outdated because most of the analyses uses data from 2005, before the implementation of NRHM program, 2) contradictory because investigations of predictors of child undernutrition in India with improper methodologies has produced inconsistent findings despite using the same data source), and 3) lacking because no national level study has assessed the consequences of child undernutrition.  Therefore, this study will apply advanced geospatial and multilevel methods on publicly available nationally representative data from NICHD-funded India Human Development Survey (IHDS) series to fill these critical knowledge-gaps. The first of the two IHDS surveys was conducted in 2005 (IHDS-I) before the implementation of NRHM and surveyed 24,314 children aged five or less from 41,554 households. IHDS-II was conducted in 2012 and surveyed 42,152 households, including 34,621 that were surveyed in 2005, and collected information on 20,810 children under the age of five and 26,559 pre-adolescents. We will use this unique data source, the largest panel dataset on child undernutrition in India to investigate: Aim 1) the trends of child undernutrition in India from 2005 to 2012 in relation to NRHM, Aim 2) individual, household, and community level predictors of child undernutrition, and Aim 3) consequences of undernutrition in the first five years of life on development during pre-adolescent (8-11) years within the Indian socio-cultural context.  Our investigation will define the heterogeneity in the burden of child undernutrition and its association with a variety of predictors across different regions of India. Moreover, it will elucidate the magnitude of its consequences on child development within the Indian context. Thus, this study will establish a foundation for addressing this humanitarian and economic crisis by identifying effective entry points for existing intervention. This proposal will also position me to take the next step towards my career goal of reducing health disparities among children through clinical practice in underserved regions, community-based research, and evidence-based advocacy. To accomplish the study aims and prepare me for my career, this research proposal is paired with a carefully curated training plan that includes specific graduate-level courses and individualized mentorship experiences with a team of technical and content experts."
"9568061","DESCRIPTION: In the last decade, HIV incidence rates among young men who have sex with men (YMSM) in U.S. urban centers have steadily increased. To shed light on these trends, since 2009, we have been conducting a cohort study of n = 600 racially/ethnically and socioeconomically diverse YMSM, informed by a theory of syndemics, to: (1) develop and test theoretically informed measurement models of the covariance of illicit drug use, unprotected sexual behavior, and mental health burden among emergent adult HIV-negative YMSM within and across time; (2) assess whether patterns of behavior are continuous, discontinuous, or some combination of both; (3) delineate the risk and protective base (physical, relational, and psychosocial factors) that predict the development of syndemics: and (4) determine the extent to which the development of syndemics is moderated by race/ethnicity, social class, and homelessness/housing stability. At baseline, participants were 18-19 years old and are returning for semi-annual follow-up visits; to date we have high levels of participant retention (e83%) across study visits. Presently, we seek to develop a more comprehensive understanding of the health of this new generation of YMSM. This will be accomplished by (a) continuing to investigate the original study aims as participants mature to ages 25-26; and (b) including two new, complementary study aims to: (1) describe the social and sexual networks of YMSM, and examine the relationship between social and sexual network-level structural characteristics, social support and normative influences on syndemic production in YMSM, singly and in combination with physical, psychosocial, and relational predictors, both within and across time; and (2) describe the acquisition of sexually transmitted infections (STIs), specifically, gonorrhea chlamydia, and syphilis, among YMSM within and across time, and to determine whether physical, relational, and psychosocial factors explain STI acquisition within and across time. We will continue to test syndemic production over time as well as to examine how this comprehensive range of physical, psychosocial, and relational predictors are related to syndemic production using additive and multiplicative (synergistic) models. Next, for YMSM in this study who have seroconverted as well as those who may seroconvert, we include an exploratory aim to describe HIV clinical treatment markers (i.e., HIV viral load, ART uptake and adherence, HIV care) and to assess the extent to which physical, relational, and psychosocial factors are associated with these clinical markers, both within and across time. We seek to extend our cohort study through the addition of semi- annual data collection for 7 additional waves of data collection. We will recruit an additional n = 329 to add to our extent study sample. New recruits will be 21-22 years old at enrollment, and with our original n=471 active and available YMSM participants, will yield a sample of n = 800 at the first assessment of our competing continuation study. As with our current study we will utilize complex modeling (Structural Equation and Latent Growth Curve Analysis and Survival Analysis) to answer our study questions."
