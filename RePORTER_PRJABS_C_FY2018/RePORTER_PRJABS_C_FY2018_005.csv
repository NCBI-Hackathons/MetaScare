"9145862","IMPLEMENTATION CORE PROJECT SUMMARY  Precision medicine is expected to promote equitable health outcomes among racial and ethnic minorities  through the delivery of individualized care that is based on biological, behavioral, and social factors that  contribute to disease risks and enhance health outcomes.1 With the development of new methods for  precision medicine, there comes a responsibility to disseminate these methods to the community and facilitate  implementation of best practices and policies to ensure equitable access among all groups. This is especially  true for initiatives in precision medicine as the National Institutes of Health prepares to invest millions of dollars  from citizen's taxes to support this research. Through these investments, investigators will receive funding to  identify and understand biological, social, psychological, clinical, and behavioral factors that are involved in  disease risk, evaluate the efficacy and effectiveness of alternate strategies for early detection and treatment  based on these factors, and develop and evaluate interventions to promote early detection, treatment, and  management. These findings will be disseminated to the scientific community through peer-reviewed reports  that are published in professional journals and presentations given at local and national scientific conferences.  Although disseminating findings to the scientific community remains a critical component of the research  process, investigators are now encouraged to disseminate results to other stakeholders. There is some  consensus that investigators have an ethical responsibility to make specific efforts to disseminate their findings  to lay stakeholders such as study participants and the general public.2-4 But, with a few exceptions,5  investigators are not likely to make these efforts. Disseminating research results beyond the scientific  community is important because it empowers a broad base of constituents to be better informed and more able  to make health decisions. The specific aims for the Implementation Core include: 1.) Develop materials and  methods to determine the needs, readiness, and capacity of stakeholders across multiple regions to implement  and adopt precision medicine approaches into clinical care and public health practice; 2.) Identify ethical, legal,  and social implication issues related to linking and integrating data on biological, social, psychological,  behavioral, and clinical factors and develop recommendations to address these issues; 3.) Deliver Evidence  Academies across the regions in the MUSC TCC multi-regional consortium to actively engage diverse  stakeholders in the development of best practices for implementing precision medicine interventions into  practices serving minority men; and 4.) Translate findings from the MUSC TCC and other initiatives in precision  medicine into policy recommendations for clinical care and public health practice that promote health equity."
"9509240","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains the most common cause of death in the US. CVD currently claims nearly one million lives yearly in the U.S., accounting for nearly 40% of all deaths. The total cost of CVD in the U.S., including hospitalizations and lost productivity, is approximately $300 billion annually. Coronary artery disease (CAD) accounts for the largest number of deaths and the majority of these costs. While the efforts aimed at treating this disease in recent decades have concentrated on surgical and catheter-based interventions, limited resources have been directed toward prevention and rehabilitation. Over the last decade, the use of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) has increased exponentially. Between 1996 and 2007, the number of PCIs performed in the U.S. increased more than 4-fold, from approximately 300,000 to more than 1.3 million yearly. During this time, PCI has accounted for 10% of the overall increase in Medicare expenditures. In light of the extraordinary increase in the use of this technology in recent years, questions have been raised regarding the cost-effectiveness of PCI, the extent to which PCI is overused, and whether selected patients may benefit from optimal medical therapy in lieu of PCI. Despite the fact that PCI is expensive, repeat PCI is common and there is no evidence for improved survival, alternative therapies are rarely considered. One alternative therapy that has been shown to improve outcomes in PCI candidates is exercise training. In the PCI vs. Exercise Training (Leipzig) study, PCI candidates randomized to one year of exercise training had improved coronary anatomy, higher exercise capacity, an improvement in quality of life and event-free survival, as well as lower health care costs when compared to the PCI group. However, the Leipzig study employed invasive angiographic methods which do not provide information on dynamic coronary flow or atherosclerosis specifically, and do not provide insight into the mechanism of atherosclerosis progression or regression. In addition, economic analyses were limited to cost per change in Canadian Cardiovascular Society Class; the Leipzig study did not assess cost effectiveness. Given the high volume of PCI, its high cost, its lack of effect on survival and the potential for alternative treatments including exercise and risk reduction in PCI candidates, the current proposal is termed PCI Alternative Using Sustained Exercise (PAUSE). The primary aim of PAUSE is apply newer imaging technologies to determine whether patients randomized to an exercise program have greater improvement in coronary function and anatomy compared to those randomized to PCI. Both groups will receive optimal medical management. We will also compare health care costs, symptoms, quality of life, and clinical outcomes between the two groups. At baseline and one year after randomization, patients will undergo an assessment of physical activity patterns and fitness using standardized questionnaires and maximal cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPX). Patients will also undergo a detailed evaluation of coronary function and anatomy with positron emission tomography combined with computed tomographic angiography (PET/CTA). PET will be used to measure myocardial perfusion and endothelial function. CTA will be used to evaluate anatomical progression of atherosclerotic disease based on a qualitative scoring system and quantitative measurement of calcified and noncalcified plaque burden. The combination of PET/CTA provides information that previously could only be obtained invasively using coronary flow wires and invasive x-ray angiography. This will permit a noninvasive way to evaluate both functional and anatomical adaptations to exercise. Our overall objective is to demonstrate the utility of a non-invasive technology to document the efficacy of exercise as an alternative treatment strategy to PCI for coronary lesions."
"9193268","Nearly 5,000 Veterans undergo abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair each year in VA hospitals. Randomized trials, including the VA-based Open Versus Endovascular Repair (OVER) Trial, have found endovascular AAA repair (EVAR), is associated with lower perioperative morbidity and mortality, less pain, and shorter length of stay than open surgical repair (OSR) However, OSR is more durable, has fewer long-term complications such as late rupture, and Veterans treated with EVAR and OSR have similar survival within two years following surgery. Given these tradeoffs, controversy remains as to which method is best suited for an individual Veteran who AAA repair, and preliminary analyses needs have found broad variations across VA hospitals in how Veterans are treated for AAA. Treatment decisions for AAA need to be aligned with Veterans' preferences. For example, a Veteran for whom a rapid recovery is of primary importance and long-term durability a lesser concern has a treatment preference which aligns most closely with EVAR. Similarly, a Veteran who wishes to avoid repeated follow-up visits and late re-interventions has a treatment preference that aligns most closely with OSR. However, while AAA treatment type varies across VA hospitals, it is unknown if these treatment variations occurs as a result of Veterans preferences, or independent of Veterans' preferences. Surgeon preferences for repair type have been poorly described, especially for surgeons treating Veterans. In preliminary work, we have performed observational analyses, surveys, and cognitive interviews. This works has demonstrated variation in AAA repair type in VA and refined qualitative methods to better understand Veterans' and surgeons? treatment decisions. In this proposal, in a cohort of Veterans who are candidates for either repair type (OSR or EVAR), we will use a survey explore Veterans' knowledge and preferences for AAA repair, and determine if Veterans who receive a decision aid as well as the survey are more likely to receive their treatment choice. We describe a cluster-randomized trial comparing two ways to better align Veterans' preferences and treatments for AAA: (1) a validated decision aid describing AAA repair types with a survey measuring Veterans' preference for repair type -- versus (2) the survey alone. Enrolled Veterans will be candidates for either endovascular or open repair, and be followed at VA hospitals by vascular surgery teams who regularly perform both types of repair. In Aim 1, we will determine Veterans' preferences for endovascular or open repair and identify domains associated with each repair type. In Aim 2, we will compare agreement between Veterans' preferences and repair type between the decision aid+survey and survey-alone groups. We will identify factors associated with agreement. Our findings will be reported to the National Surgery Office Vascular Surgery Advisory Board to help ensure Veterans' preferences remain at the center of AAA treatment decisions. We have recruited 20 VA Medical Centers and their vascular surgery teams who are anxious to participate in this important trial to help Veterans make the best decisions."
"9261084","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The now chronic nature of HIV has been a major advancement in AIDS care, but as with any chronic condition brings with it the recognition of other sequelae, including the HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND). In addition, as a natural consequence of the chronicity of infection and reduced new infection, the face of HIV infection is changing to an older population; soon over half of infected individuals will be 50 years of age or greater. As detailed in our Research Plan, we will now take the lessons others and we have learned about HIV and the brain and apply it to the changing epidemic - the graying of HIV, the nature of the effects on the brain of the chronic infection, means to treat HIV in the brain, and potential interaction with conditions linked to aging and other neurodegenerative disorders.   We will set about this through the Chronic HIV Infection and Aging in NeuroAIDS (CHAIN) Center as described in this proposal. We will accomplish four Action Items novel Biomarkers, the Role of Macrophages CNS Penetrating Antiviral Therapeutics, and the Effects on Chronic CNS Infection on Neurons, and support our investigators' research efforts through our Cores (Administrative, Biophysical Assessment Cells/Tissues/Animals, Developmental, International, Phenomics, Systems Biology, and Therapeutics). Our goals driven by our framework: researching of the chronicity of HIV infection in the CNS with a systems biology approach."
"9242501","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Melanoma has a high propensity for metastasis and accounts for 80% of skin cancer-related deaths. Despite the progress in melanoma therapeutics over the last several years, melanoma remains a challenge in clinical oncology. The immune system plays an important role in controlling and eliminating cancer. However, tumors often evade/escape immune attack by modifying their phenotypes and inducing immunosuppression. Recent breakthrough in treating cancers with immune checkpoint inhibitors has fueled the intensive investigation of new therapeutic targets, including negative regulators of adaptive and innate immune systems. We have found that human metastatic melanoma cells spontaneously secrete biologically active interleukin (IL)-1? in the absence of exogenous stimuli because of constitutive activation of IL-1 receptor signaling and a multi-protein complex, ?inflammasome?, exhibiting a feature of ?autoinflammation? (IL-1?-mediated dysregulation of immune system). IL-1? is a pleiotropic pro-inflammatory cytokine and plays a critical role in tumor progression, immunosuppression and chemoresistance. Peripheral blood is an information reservoir and represents systemic processes altered by the presence of tumor cells. We conducted transcriptome profiling of whole blood cells from melanoma patients, and identified differentially expressed genes in human melanoma blood. Of these, we identified a unique cytokine, IL-37, which was highly upregulated in metastatic melanoma blood. IL-37 is a homolog of the IL-1 cytokine family. Dinarello (co-I)?s group has found that IL-37 is a novel inhibitor of innate immunity. PI?s group has found that IL-37 is a novel inhibitor of adaptive immunity. IL-37 is induced in pro-inflammatory milieu containing IL-1. We hypothesize that IL-37 is induced by autoinflammation in human melanoma, leading to tumor-induced immunoevasion. We propose to test this hypothesis using tumor and blood samples from melanoma patients (in Aim 1) and unravel the immunoevasive mechanisms of action of IL-37 in tumor cells (in Aim 2) and blood cells (in Aim 3) in melanoma. The specific aims are: Aim 1: To identify cellular source of IL-37 expression in human melanoma samples and determine the link between IL-37 and autoinflammation in human melanoma. Aim 2: To define biological and mechanistic effects of IL-37 in melanoma cells. Aim 3: To define biological and mechanistic effects of IL-37 in blood cells. IL-37, an inhibitor of innate and adaptive immunity, has not been investigated in tumor immunity. Elucidating the link between autoinflammation and immune escape, and understanding the role of IL-37 in tumor immune escape is critical for clinical success in melanoma and will lead to the development of effective therapeutic agents for cancer."
"9428412","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         The proper control of acute and chronic pain is one of the most important areas in health care. Despite the profound advances in neuroscience over the past 20 years, we still largely use opiate narcotics, much as was done in the Civil War. Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is one of the most common orthopedic procedures performed. While knee pain is often a complaint that precedes TKA, the procedure itself is associated with considerable post-operative pain lasting days to weeks, and adequate postoperative pain control is an important factor in determining recovery time, hospital length of stay, and long-term surgical outcomes. Primary methods used to manage post-operative pain primarily involve systemic opiates. Despite available strategies, patients still report considerable post-operative pain, and often struggle to complete post-operative physical therapy regimens. Additionally, systemic opiates have associated side-effects that can lead to post-operative complications including but not limited to mental-clouding, confusion, addiction, respiratory depression, interactions with other medications, and fatigue. These are not trivial concerns as the population receiving TKA are more and more likely to be elderly and/or overweight and thus these complications can have serious negative consequences. New analgesic strategies are needed that can be used adjunctively to existing strategies with the potential to reduce reliance on opioid analgesia. Several novel brain stimulation technologies including transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) are beginning to demonstrate promise as treatments for a variety of pain conditions. Electricity has no metabolite or other residue, and can be delivered with minimal discomfort and without problems associated with drug-drug interactions. In two preliminary studies, the investigators have found that tDCS can reduce post-operative PCA use by as much as 46% in TKA patients while simultaneously reducing subjective pain ratings. These findings are promising, but this new technology is in its infancy, and a foundation of well-controlled, high-quality clinical trials needs to be established before this field moves forward. The proposed study will be the first randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled clinical trial of the effects of tDCS on subjective pain-ratings, PCA opioid usage, and post- operative complications among veterans receiving unilateral TKA surgery. Further, this study will examine the relative efficacy of 3 different tDCS dosing strategies compared to sham stimulation. Data from this trial will likely yield information regarding the feasibility and efficacy of tDCS as a post-operative pain-management approach. If the proposed pilot trial suggests significant and meaningful effects of tDCS as an adjunctive post- operative pain management strategy, this could change the way post-operative pain management is approached in the future."
"9145864","Despite ongoing efforts, medically underserved populations continue to experience disproportionate rates of  morbidity and mortality from chronic diseases. The disparity gaps are particularly notable among minority men.  Precision medicine holds significant promise to make substantial strides in reducing racial disparities through  the delivery of individualized health care based on biological, behavioral, and social factors that contribute to  disease risks and enhance health outcomes. Academic health centers, community-based organizations and  providers, and public health leaders need to play a collective role in developing, implementing, and  disseminating these precision medicine approaches into the settings that are most likely to impact the health of  minority men. To date, most precision medicine research and translation into the clinical settings have  traditionally been conducted within the context of academic health centers which largely reside in urban  settings with the highest levels of research and clinical care infrastructures. To expand the capacity to conduct  precision medicine in more regional, rural communities where the largest disparity gaps exist, an even more  collaborative community inclusive of academicians, community health care providers, public health advocates  from government and community-based organization will need to work together utilizing the principles of  community-based participatory research (CBPR) to understand the needs and tailor the mechanisms to best  translate precision medicine into the community settings where minority men largely seek their care. Therefore,  the Medical University of South Carolina Transdisciplinary Collaborative Center (MUSC TCC) will meet this  need by serving as a multi-regional hub for translating novel precision medicine approaches into the  community with an explicit goal to promote health equity among minority men. To this end, MUSC has  solicited the commitments from numerous academic and community-based advocates from HHS regions III,  IV, and VI who are equipped with the expertise needed to fulfill the goal of this TCC for form a Consortium  Core which will be the major component within the Center's overall Consortium Steering Council. These  Consortium Core members will be charged with the following specific aims: (1.) Form a multi-regional  infrastructure to provide the direction, priorities and governance of this TCC to promote health equity among  minority men through precision medicine; (2.) Identify priorities for precision medicine research among diverse  academic, community, clinical, and public health stakeholders through the leadership of the Consortium Core  and by having key Consortium members reach out to their local communities to identify gaps and preferences  for precision medicine intervention which will inform future MUSC TCC research efforts; (3.) Implement and  monitor pilot project research to address minority men's health in precision medicine; and (4) Translate findings  from TCC research into clinic and community-based practices to address racial disparities among minority  men."
"9378722","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):          Objective: The proposed study will investigate the relationship between memory deficits and abnormal electrical activity seen on electroencephalography (EEG) in patients with seizures. Patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) often demonstrate memory dysfunction in the setting of otherwise normal intelligence. This finding is consistent with the theory that establishing new memories is dependent to a large extent on the function of the hippocampus and other mesial temporal lobe structures, a network known to be dysfunctional in TLE. Prior studies found an association between disruptions of cognitive task performance and the presence of interictal epileptiform discharges (IEDs). IEDs are intermittent spikes or sharp waves that reflect abnormal neuronal firing, but do not organize into a seizure. Embedded within the IEDs may be pathological high frequency gamma oscillations (HFOs), distinct from the normal high frequency activity that is thought to underlie memory formation. In clinical practice, IEDs are considered only to be markers of epilepsy and are not suppressed with medications. Little is known, however, regarding the properties of IEDs that pose the greatest risk to cognitive function or the mechanism by which IEDs cause cognitive deficits. The present study examines the effects of IEDs during encoding on subsequent memory for the stimulus items. The first aim of the study is to determine the spatial and temporal characteristics of IEDs within the hippocampus that will predict poorer delayed recall and recognition, as well as identify the effect of embedded pathological HFOs. The second aim is to identify the mechanism by which IEDs interrupt memory encoding. The hypothesis is that IEDs disrupt the normal EEG rhythms that underlie memory formation. More specifically, the prediction is that IEDs will cause a decrease in the amount of normal high frequency gamma activity induced during memory encoding. Furthermore, it is proposed that IEDs and their associated pathological HFOs will disrupt the synchronous timing, or coherence, of normal gamma oscillations throughout the hippocampus. Research Plan/Methods: To test these hypotheses, subjects with TLE will complete memory tasks during intracranial EEG recordings. Testing will include verbal and non-verbal encoding, working memory, and delayed recall and recognition tasks. The electrodes will be implanted within or alongside the hippocampus for clinical evaluations prior to possible resective epilepsy surgery. IEDs will be identified by manual review, with temporal and spatial properties quantified using Neuroscan software. HFO power and coherence will be assessed using spectral analysis. Clinical Relevance: The interruption of normal EEG oscillations by IEDs would help to explain both transient and long-term memory dysfunction in this patient population. The proposed study will also determine if pathological HFOs within the IEDs contribute to their adverse cognitive effects. Evidence that IEDs disrupt electrical activity necessary for memory encoding may indicate the need for suppression of discharges or point the way to new treatments for memory dysfunction. These findings could direct future investigations aimed at therapeutic approaches to improve cognition in epilepsy patients by alteration of abnormal oscillatory activity."
"9349732","In the Veterans Healthcare System, aging men with testosterone deficiency and men on androgen depletion therapy for prostate cancer are at increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes (T2D). Although studies examining this issue have focused on the role of testosterone deficiency as a risk factor for insulin resistance, this approach ignores the role of testosterone deficiency as a potential cause of pancreatic ??cell dysfunction in men. Although it has been established that testosterone action is mediated via the androgen receptor (AR) -a ligand-activated transcription factor- the role of the AR in ?-cell dysfunction in T2D is unknown. There is tremendous potential for therapeutic application of novel work that addresses androgen deficiency in the context of T2D in large segments of aging men. The new far-reaching preliminary data from our laboratory show that male mice with conditional deletion of the AR in ?-cells (?ARKO) exhibit decreased glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) and develop ?-cell failure to compensate for high fat diet- induced insulin resistance. The insulinotropic function of the testosterone-AR axis is present in cultured male human islets. Most importantly, in ?-cells, the AR is extranuclear, and the stimulatory effect of AR on GSIS involves cAMP generation and protein kinase A (PKA) activation. Finally, testosterone amplifies glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) enhancement of GSIS in rodent islets. Accordingly, the aims of this application are: 1) To explore a novel paradigm in which testosterone action on AR enhances GLP-1 action in ?-cells and 2) To elucidate the molecular determinants that maintain AR in an extranuclear compartment of ?-cells that amplify GLP-1 receptor action. The knowledge that will be generated by this grant will fill key gaps in our understanding of the fundamental mechanism of ?-cell dysfunction in men. This information will provide the foundation for development of approaches to modulate AR in a tissue-specific manner to prevent diabetes without prostate or cardiovascular side effects. Thus, the proposed work will have major scientific impact and open clinically relevant avenues for the Veterans Healthcare System population."
"9428413","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Of the roughly half a million Veterans with Alzheimer's disease (AD), the vast majority will progress through the advanced stage of the disease. It is important to ascertain the most safe and effective treatments for individuals with advanced AD.  Cholinesterase inhibitor (CI) medications are the mainstay of treatment for mild and moderate AD, and they are often continued in advanced disease. Anecdotal reports indicate that patients may worsen when CI medications are discontinued, but there is little rigorous evidence about the effects of discontinuation. VHA Pharmacy Benefits Management Service Guidelines recommend discontinuing CI under certain conditions, but acknowledge that the issue has not been well studied and that the recommendations are not evidence-based.  Because AD follows a variable course, the only way objectively to determine the risks and benefits of CI medications in advanced AD is through a controlled study. We propose to conduct a placebo-controlled, double-blinded discontinuation trial of CI medications in advanced AD. We will recruit 200 Veterans with advanced dementia who have been taking a stable dose of donepezil or galantamine (the main CI medications in the VA formulary), and randomize them. Half the group will carry out a blinded Real Taper: reducing the prior stable dose of CI to one-half for three weeks, then switching to placebo for three weeks. The other half will carry out a blinded Sham Taper: remaining on the prior stable dose for six weeks. We will compare the two arms in (1) ability to complete the 6- weeks successfully, and (2) changes from baseline to week 6 in cognition, functioning, behavior. Analyses will apply on a non-inferiority study design. Specific Aim 1: To ascertain if successful CI discontinuation rates are non-inferior in Real Taper compared to Sham Taper.  Hypothesis 1: The rate of successful CI discontinuation in Real Taper will be non-inferior to the  rate of successful CI discontinuation in Sham Taper. Specific Aim 2: To ascertain if changes in cognition, functioning, behavior, and caregiver burden over 6 weeks are different in Real Taper compared to Sham Taper.  Hypothesis 2: Changes in cognition, functioning, behavior, and caregiver burden in Real Taper  will not differ from changes in Sham Taper. Specific Aim 3: To identify patient-level and disease-level factors (such as behavioral symptoms and duration of treatment and disease) that predict unsuccessful discontinuation, adverse events, and worsening. Given the shortage of previous research about CI discontinuation, this aim is not hypothesis-driven. This research will clarify the risks and benefits of CI medications in advanced AD. It will inform guidelines about when to continue or discontinue CI medications, and can thus impact the medical care of tens of thousands of Veterans. More specific information about the effects of treatments for AD will reduce adverse events and maximize benefits. This research will also generate hypotheses about types of individuals for whom discontinuation has differential effects."
"9380319","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Title: Effectiveness of Zonisamide in the Treatment of Alcohol-Dependent Veterans ABSTRACT: Veterans have a high prevalence of alcohol dependence (AD), and those with AD also have a high rate of co-occurring psychiatric illnesses. Zonisamide is an extremely promising medicine for treating AD and managing other clinical problems including psychiatric disorders. Zonisamide is an affordable, generic anticonvulsant with unique actions on the major neurotransmitter systems involved in alcoholism, and it has neuroprotective effects. We recently completed a randomized, placebo- controlled pilot study of zonisamide in treating AD that showed significant reductions in heavy drinking, overall drinking, and alcohol craving. Zonisamide was very well tolerated in this study. In this application, we propose a larger (N = 160), 14-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, effectiveness study of zonisamide in reducing heavy drinking and improving outcomes in a representative population of heavy-drinking veterans with AD. We describe zonisamide's potential to break through the barriers in the treatment of veterans with AD as well as its unique pharmacology that brings innovation to alcoholism treatment. An inexpensive, hypothesis-driven, exploratory, translational, pharmacogenetic component adds to the innovation and will work towards optimizing outcomes and personalizing treatment for veterans."
"9145861","ADMINISTRATIVE CORE PROJECT SUMMARY  The overarching goal of the Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC) Transdisciplinary Collaborative  Center (TCC) in Precision Medicine for Minority Men's Health is to determine the most effective ways to  integrate, interpret, and apply biological, social, psychological, and clinical determinants of disease risks and  outcomes into more precise medical strategies to prevent and treat chronic health care conditions and  diseases.

"9441477","Inflammation is the body's attempt at self-protection to remove harmful stimuli and begin the healing process. Chronic inflammation can eventually cause several diseases and conditions, including cancers, rheumatoid arthritis, atherosclerosis, and plays a role in heart disease. The overarching goals of nominee?s research involve elucidating molecular underpinnings of cell growth/survival and death/apoptosis with particular reference cancer, atheroscleroscosis, and cardiovascular hypertension. The American Cancer Society estimates highest percent of new cases and mortality resulting from lung and breast cancers in females, while prostate and lung cancers account for highest percentage of new cases and associated mortality among men. Overall incidence rates and mortality due to lung and breast cancers have decreased over last decade partly due to advances in diagnosis and therapeutic modalities, particularly targeted therapeutics for a number of cancers including the non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLCs). However, adaptive genetic alterations and mutations in cancers contribute to therapy failures and relapses in clinic occur that often result in emergence of resistant, hard to treat disease, and warrant development of new therapeutic strategies to overcome drug resistance and improve therapeutic outcomes. By utilizing a functional gene-knockout approach the nominee identified a novel, apoptosis inducing protein termed CARP-1/CCAR1 (J. Biol. Chem. 278: 33422-33435, 2003). CARP-1 regulates apoptosis signaling induced by diverse chemotherapeutics such as Adriamycin, Etoposide, and Gefitinib (reviewed by nominee in Oncotarget 6(9): 6499-510, 2015). Following CARP-1 discovery, the nominee conducted a chemical-biological approach to identify novel small molecule CARP-1 Functional Mimetic (CFMs) compounds (J. Biol. Chem. 286 (44): 38000-38017, 2011). CFMs inhibit growth diverse cancer cells including therapy-resistant triple-negative breast cancers (TNBC) and non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLCs) in part by binding with CARP-1, causing elevated levels of CARP-1 and apoptosis (Oncotarget, 2016, in press). The nominee?s long-term goal is to elucidate molecular mechanisms of therapy resistance in cellular models of resistant TNBC and NSCLCs, and utilize this knowledge to develop novel, safer and effective anti-cancer modalities. In this context CFMs or their derivatives are anticipated to have clinical utility, and could provide novel means to develop future strategies for effective treatment of TNBC, NSCLCs, and other cancers in the VA healthcare system and beyond. Hypertension is a major health issue in the U.S., and the prevalence of atheros clerotic reno-vascular hypertension is rising. Renal artery stenosis occurs in 28% of veterans undergoing cardiac catheterization with a greater than 3-fold risk in those over age 65. Nonetheless, there is an alarming burden of cardiovascular and renal morbidity and mortality with attendant increases in direct medical costs, loss of productivity and quality of life in our Veterans with hypertension. The nominee has a productive collaboration with Detroit VA clinician- scientist to study the molecular mechanisms of the hypertension. Since CARP-1 is also a co-activator of the signaling by the steroid-thyroid receptors (Molecular Cell 31: 510-519, 2008), and with the knowledge that mineralocorticoid receptor is known to play an important role in reno-vascular signaling, a potential overlap of CARP-1 functions in this model was envisioned. Moreover, the fact that anti-cancer chemotherapies often affect cardiac functions in patients, the nominee initiated this collaboration to study overlapping as well as specific, perhaps, novel aspects of the angiotensin-endothelin signaling in Reno-vascular model. Although this hypothesis has yet to tested, the nominee has thus far contributed in publication of an abstract in a national meeting and is serving as a co-investigator of the two current VA funded Merit applications that focus on investigating mechanisms of reno-vascular hypertension."
"9470683","Project Summary Selective loss of dopaminergic (DA) neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) is a hallmark characteristic of Parkinson's disease (PD). PD is the most common neurodegenerative movement disorder and preferentially affects men, who have two-fold increased risk of PD incidence compared to women. Substantial evidence in humans and animal models of PD suggest estrogen is responsible for this decreased risk. How estrogen protects SNc DA neurons is not clear. Though the mechanisms underlying SNc DA neuron vulnerability are not fully understood, mitochondrial dysfunction is a clear contributor to PD pathology. SNc DA neurons are critical regulators of voluntary movement. Given the importance of voluntary movement to evolutionary survival, SNc DA neurons evolved redundant mechanisms to ensure ready calcium, neurotransmitter, and ATP sufficient to sustain prolonged release. Cav1 ca2+ channels help to establish SNc readiness by supporting pacemaking, stimulating DA synthesis, and triggering mitochondrial ATP production. Additionally, evidence suggests that dopamine metabolism via monoamine oxidase (MAO) stimulates mitochondrial ATP production. While these effects may provide short-term advantage, continual perpetual stimulation of mitochondrial respiration in SNc DA neurons generates reactive oxygen and nitrogen species, and increased mitochondrial damage and turnover. My preliminary data demonstrate that baseline mitochondrial oxidation in SNc DA axons of female mice is reduced compared to male mice. This effect was further increased by 17?-estradiol and eliminated by estrogen receptor inhibitor, 4-hydroxytamoxifen. There are two potential mediators of this effect. First, estrogen is an MAO inhibitor. Second, estrogen acutely and potently inhibits Cav1 ca2+ channels. Given this preliminary data, we hypothesize that estrogen protects SNc DA neurons by lowering axonal mitochondrial oxidant stress through two convergent mechanisms: 1) by diminishing MAO activity and 2) inhibiting Cav1 Ca2+ channels. We will test this hypothesis using two photon laser scanning microscopy in ex vivo brain slices of animals with targeted expression of fluorescent mitochondrial oxidation or calcium sensors coupled with rigorous pharmacology. Additionally, we will assess the contribution of 17?-estradiol to the bioenergetic demands of sustained dopamine release. In addition to addressing these timely and important questions, this project will provide advanced training in optical, electrophysiological, pharmacological, and genetic techniques, which, when coupled with training in scientific rigor from Drs. Surmeier and Woolley, will propel me to an independent and productive academic career."
"9441272","Project Summary/Abstract  (1) Our work is directed towards understanding the structure, organization, and anatomy of human memory. We study neurological patients who have circumscribed memory impairment as the result of brain injury or disease that has damaged the hippocampus bilaterally. We also study healthy volunteers using the technique of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). This work is continuing to reveal useful and important information about the organization of memory and the brain systems that support memory. In this work, I collaborate with Christine Smith, Ph.D. at the VA (Research Health Science Specialist), who in 2016 obtained independent VA funding. I also collaborate with Robert Clark, Ph.D. (VA investigator) in his program of work on memory in rodents.  Memory is a precious mental faculty. Lost or diminished memory, as occurs in neurological disease, leads to a loss of self, a loss of one?s life history, and a loss of the ability to have enduring contact with other human beings. Memory problems are common in VA neurological and psychiatric patients. Modest difficulties with memory are of course well-documented as a universal feature of normal aging, and more severe memory problems are a prominent early sign of Alzheimer?s disease. Our work is intended to learn how memory is affected by these conditions, how the brain accomplishes learning and memory, and what brain structures are important. Our neuropsychological work has provided new tests, the possibility of better and earlier diagnosis, improved understanding of the conditions that affect memory, and established a clearer path to the development of interventions for treating and ultimately preventing diseases that affect memory.  During the past 10 years, our work has been reported in 95 publications, (53 peer-reviewed journal articles, 20 books or book chapters, 18 invited reviews, and four other pieces). We explored a number of issues that are prominent in current discussions about the organization of memory. We investigated how eye movements can be experience-dependent (e.g., different depending on whether a scene is novel or recently presented); the key distinction between conscious and unconscious memory systems; the function of the hippocampus with respect to the constructs of recollection and familiarity; the brain-based distinction between short-term (working) memory and long-term memory; the role of the hippocampus and related medial temporal lobe structures in recollecting the recent past, the remote past, and in imagining the future; the special status of face recognition with respect to hippocampal function; the possible role of medial temporal lobe structures in certain perceptual functions; and the role of these structures in navigation, scene construction, and spatial cognition. Over my career, my work has been cited 48,000 times and continues to be cited about 2000 times/year. My h-index is 108.  Current work proceeds on several fronts. First, we are carrying out a number of studies supported by the VA to illuminate the ways that eye movements can reflect memory. For example, individuals scan a scene differently depending on whether the scene is familiar or novel. They make fewer fixations and sample fewer regions when viewing a familiar (as opposed to novel) scene. What kind of memory effects are these? Do these eye movement effects simply provide another example of conscious, declarative memory? Or, are they more automatic, and independent of awareness that a scene is novel or familiar? Are they hippocampus- dependent or independent? Do they honor or contradict the dominant view that conscious memory is hippocampus-dependent? In other NIH-supported work we are exploring memory and spatial cognition, and autobiographical memory. We are attempting to reconcile two traditions of work that emphasize the role of the hippocampus in memory vs. its role in the ability to mentally construct scenes and navigate. Squire - 1"
"9350446","Arterial occlusive diseases remain responsible for the leading causes of death and disability in Western nations and have a particularly high prevalence among the Veteran population. Current therapy depends upon invasive revascularization with techniques ranging from endovascular angioplasty and stenting to open surgical vein bypass. Unfortunately, some patients are anatomically poor candidates for invasive revascularization. Arteriogenesis is the vital process of collateral artery formation, which largely occurs in areas of pre-formed arterial interconnections remote from the effects of ischemia. Arteriogenesis should not be confused with angiogenesis, a well-studied and biologically distinct mechanism through which capillary density of an ischemic tissue bed is increased. Strategies focused on ?therapeutic angiogenesis? for revascularization have not been clinically successful to date. Evidence suggests that the most important factors to functional collateral development are mechanical forces - fluid shear stress and circumferential wall stress - which become increased in remote arterioles after the occlusion of a conductance artery. Unfortunately, as the vessel diameter increases, shear stress falls quickly and the impetus for growth dissipates before maximal conductance is restored. To date, the biochemical signaling mechanisms governing arteriogenesis remain largely unknown. This knowledge gap prevents development of molecular therapies that would enhance collateral growth, a conceptually important strategy for medical treatment of many vascular diseases.  Nucleotides are released from cells in response to mechanical perturbations, such as increased shear stress, and function as signaling molecules. Extracellular nucleotides, acting through their receptors, activate vascular and inflammatory cells and promote their interaction, are mitogenic, and result in endothelial nitric oxide production. Our studies to date have demonstrated the P2Y2 receptor is necessary for normal collateral growth and blood flow recovery in a model of femoral artery ligation (FAL). We have also found that administration of intra-arterial nucleotides is beneficial to blood flow recovery after FAL. We therefore hypothesize that purinergic signaling governs arteriogenesis. Our hypothesis was formulated after a careful analysis of published work in the field and the generation of some key preliminary data in our own laboratory. In Aim 1, we will measure nucleotide release after FAL and identify the changes in purinergic receptor expression during collateral artery growth in order to establish a link between purinergic signaling mechanisms and collateral development. In Aim 2, we will investigate the role of purinergic signaling mechanisms in the initiation and maintenance of vascular inflammation which drives arteriogenesis. Our long term-goal is to develop a pharmacotherapy capable of enhancing collateral growth and providing a medical therapy for the effects of arterial occlusive disease. The critical insights gained through the completion of this research will enable directed pharmacological therapies for arterial occlusive disease in any vascular bed and represent a great stride toward providing medical therapy for our aging Veterans as well as the general population."
"9349979","A new emerging hallmark for many malignancies is altered metabolic direction to support rapid cell proliferation. Considerable progress has been made in elucidating how modified cell signaling contributes to deregulated cell growth in cancer, much less is known regarding metabolic rewiring to provide for the demand in building blocks to support the ever-increasing cell numbers. Within the last few years metabolite profiling between normal and cancer cells has provided new insights to uncover the underlying mechanisms of cellular transformation. Glutamine is the most abundant amino acid in blood and is recognized as a critical contributor in nearly every central metabolic task of proliferating tumor cells. Recently, glutamine was deemed as an essential component in mitochondrial metabolisms to ensure that rapidly growing tumor cells will remain metabolically versatile, particularly the reprogramming of the oxidative to reductive mitochondrial glutamine metabolism. Reductive glutamine metabolism has been shown to be preferred under hypoxia condition via the stabilization of the hypoxia-induced transcription factor 1? (HIF-1?). Our group demonstrated the etiological role of an ectopic expression of a murine neuronal receptor, metabotropic glutamate receptor 1 (GRM1) in mouse melanocytes in genetically modified transgenic mouse melanoma models. Aberrant expression of the human form of GRM1 was also observed in ?65% of human melanoma cell lines and biopsy samples but not normal human melanocytes, suggesting its involvement in melanomagenesis. Recently, we uncovered yet another consequence in cells with enhanced/aberrant GRM1 expression, upregulated HIF-1?. These preliminary results suggest there may be a link between altered glutamine metabolism and glutamatergic signaling mediated by aberrant GRM1 expression. We hypothesize that ectopic GRM1 expression in melanocytes results in deregulated cell proliferation, increase in HIF-1?, which participates in the rewiring of the metabolic networks that fuel the increasing demand for the synthesis of biological molecules required for cell growth."
"9468759","Abstract Stroke is one of the leading causes of adult disability in the United States, costing an estimated 33 billion dollars annually. Up to 30% of stroke patients experience cognitive decline in the first year after their stroke. There are no FDA approved drugs that can prevent post-stroke cognitive decline, a sub-category of vascular dementia, in part due to the mechanism(s) being poorly understood. Recently our lab published the first paper to show that an adaptive B-lymphocyte response to stroke can cause delayed cognitive dysfunction in mice, and that a similar adaptive immune response occurs in the brains of some human stroke patients that suffer from vascular dementia. This is the first evidence that in some people, post-stroke dementia may be caused by a B-lymphocyte response propagated by the stroke lesion. However, the precise mechanism by which B-lymphocytes mediate damage following stroke is still unknown. Discovering this mechanism is vital for developing treatments. Our proposed mechanism is that B-lymphocyte mediated cognitive impairment following stroke is T-cell dependent, requires a direct interaction between CD4+ T-follicular helper cells and B-lymphocytes, and is caused by the production of pathogenic central nervous system (CNS) specific autoantibodies. To test this hypothesis, I will generate transgenic mice with a conditional knockout of Bcl-6 in CD4+ cells. Bcl-6 is critical for the development of T-follicular helper cells, and so is critical for T-cell dependent B-lymphocyte activation. I will also inject into the brains of nave animals, antibodies isolated from mice that have undergone a mouse model of stroke, and I will perform modified sandwich ELISAs to determine if mice generate the same six CNS specific autoantibodies that have been found to occur in human stroke patients. The completion of these aims will lead to a greater understanding of the mechanisms by which B-lymphocytes can contribute to the development of cognitive decline in the weeks and months after stroke, which is necessary for the development of treatments that target B-lymphocyte responses to stroke."

"9447994","The ability of the surgeon to accurately visualize tumor margins and identify metastases is necessary for the success of any cancer operation. Fluorescence imaging, because of its high sensitivity, low cost, portability, and real-time capabilities has great potential to improve surgical outcomes. Our laboratories have pioneered the use of fluorophore-conjugated tumor-specific antibodies for detection and resection of GI cancers in orthotopic mouse models with highly improved outcomes. Thus far, the fluorophores that we have utilized have been in the visible range of light. There are numerous advantages to near infrared (NIR) fluorophores which have better tissue depth of penetration compared to fluorophores in the visible range. Furthermore, we now have humanized tumor-specific anti-CEA and anti-CA 19-9 antibodies that can be used for future clinical trials. The present grant application proposes to develop the potential of using humanized anti-CEA and anti-CA 19-9 antibodies conjugated with appropriate fluorophores in the NIR 700 to 800 nm range to label primary tumors and their metastases for fluorescence laparoscopic staging, fluorescence-guided surgery (FGS), and adjuvant photoimmunotherapy of pancreatic and colon cancer in patient-derived orthotopic xenograft (PDOX) models. The specific aims of this grant are: 1) Validation of NIR fluorophore-labeled tumor-specific humanized anti-CEA and anti-CA 19-9 antibodies to label primary tumors and metastases in PDOX mouse models of pancreatic and colorectal cancer, 2) Comparison of near infrared fluorophores conjugated to humanized anti-CEA and anti-CA 19-9 antibodies with different properties for dosing response, signal duration, photobleaching, signal-to- background ratio, and phototoxicity, in PDOX models of human pancreatic and colon cancer, 3) Development of intraoperative photoimmunotherapy (PIT) using the humanized anti-CEA and anti-CA 19-9 antibodies, or other antibodies shown to be effective in Aims 1 and 2, conjugated to IRDye 700DX as adjuvant treatment to FGS for pancreatic and colorectal cancer in PDOX nude and NSG-humanized mouse models. The completion of these aims will set the stage for clinical trials of fluorescent-antibody-based FGS that can change the paradigm of surgical oncology and greatly improve outcomes of recalcitrant cancers.

"9145867","RESEARCH PROJECT 3 ? PROJECT SUMMARY  There are considerable and persistent racial disparities in prostate cancer outcomes. Prostate cancer  disproportionately affects African American men in terms of incidence, morbidity, and mortality, even after  adjustment for stage. African American men have a 2- to 3- times increased risk of developing prostate cancer  and have a greater mortality rate compared to white men. Racial disparities in prostate cancer outcomes  mirror racial differences in vitamin D levels. African American men exhibit a high prevalence of vitamin D  deficiency; several studies have shown that a majority of African American men has sub-optimal levels of  circulating vitamin D. For this reason, vitamin D3 supplementation is likely to particularly benefit these men.  Vitamin D promotes the differentiation of prostate cancer cells and maintains the differentiated phenotype of  prostate epithelial cells, raising the possibility that long-term vitamin D deficiency may contribute to the  progression of subclinical prostate cancer to clinical disease, especially among African American men.  Therefore, eliminating racial disparities in circulating levels of vitamin D could have important implications for  reducing disparities in prostate cancer outcomes. This MUSC-based research team has shown that  supplementation eliminates racial disparities in serum levels of 25(OH)D between African American and white  men, and that vitamin D3 supplementation at 4000 international units (IU) per day may benefit patients with  low-risk prostate cancer on active surveillance. The investigators plan to conduct a study enrolling African  American and white men who have been diagnosed with prostate cancer and have selected prostatectomy as  a definitive treatment. These subjects will be randomized to vitamin D3 supplementation at 4000 IU per day (or  placebo) for two months, before undergoing surgery. They plan to assess the transcription profiles in prostate  tissue specimens collected from these subjects at time of surgery, using RNA sequencing (RNA-seq)  technology. The main objectives of this application are to determine a) whether there are significant differences  in transcription within prostate tissue specimens between African American and white men; b) whether vitamin  D3 supplementation at 4000 IU per day for two months, compared to placebo, will significantly affect  transcription in prostate tissue specimens from enrolled subjects; and c) whether genes involved in the  hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis are differentially expressed in the prostate between African  American and white men and how vitamin D3 supplementation affects the HPA axis. Comparison of  transcription profiles and biological pathways between subjects enrolled in the treatment or the placebo arm of  the study will also allow us to establish whether vitamin D3 supplementation is beneficial to the prostate and as  a preventive and/or therapeutic option for early-stage prostate cancer, especially among African American  men."

"9452423","The combined syndromes of type 1 (T1D) and type 2 (T2D) diabetes mellitus affect nearly one in four Veterans and over 422 million individuals worldwide. Inadequate insulin secretion from the pancreatic ? cell plays a primary role in the pathogenesis of both major forms of diabetes. However, the mechanisms responsible for ? cell failure in this disease remain poorly understood. The long-term goal of our research program is to delineate the role of altered ? cell Ca2+ homeostasis in diabetes pathophysiology and to understand how Ca2+ dyshomeostasis activates common and overlapping stress pathways in T1D and T2D. Store-operated calcium entry (SOCE) is a process activated in response to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) Ca2+ depletion and is initiated when Ca2+ dissociates from the ER Ca2+ sensor, STIM1, leading to STIM1 oligomerization and translocation to the plasma membrane. Here, STIM1 associates with the selection Ca2+ channel Orai alone or as part of a multi-protein complex consisting of Orai and nonselective TRPC cation channels. The formation of these complexes ultimately leads to refilling of ER Ca2+ stores via transfer of Ca2+ from the extracellular space. To date, the role of SOCE in the pancreatic ? cell remains largely uncharacterized, but our preliminary data has identified alterations in STIM1 expression and SOCE activity in models of both T1D and T2D and shows that inhibition of SOCE as well as STIM1 knockdown leads to decreased glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, altered ? cell calcium signaling, depletion of ER Ca2+ stores, and increased ? cell ER stress. Thus, we hypothesize that Ca2+ dyshomeostasis arising from alterations in SOCE is a key determinant of the diminished insulin secretory capacity and reduced ? cell survival observed in diabetes. The specific goals of this work are to: (1) define a role for store-operated calcium entry in the maintenance of pancreatic ? cell function using genetic and pharmacologic in vivo and in vitro STIM1 loss and gain of function models; (2) test whether loss of STIM1 and SOCE dysregulation in the ? cell contributes to defects observed in T1D and T2D; and (3) define the molecular and signaling pathways leading to decreased STIM1 expression and the impaired ability of SOCE to replenish ER Ca2+ stores in rodent and human models of diabetes. This work will fill an important knowledge gap in the field and define a novel role for impaired ? cell SOCE in diabetes mellitus. The translational impact of this work will be the identification of pathways that can be targeted clinically to improve ? cell health under disease conditions."
"9257232","Project Summary  Fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva (FOP) is a rare genetic disease characterized by the formation of extra-skeletal bone known as heterotopic ossification (HO). HO is caused by a series of cellular and tissue- wide events that lead to bone formation within skeletal muscle and other soft connective tissues. All familial and sporadic cases with a classic clinical presentation of FOP carry a gain-of-function heterozygous mutation in ACVR1 (R206H; c.617G>A), a cell surface receptor that mediates bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling, which has been recognized for its chondro- and osteogenic-induction potential. The heterotopic bone that forms in FOP patients is qualitatively normal endochondral bone, however initiation of this bone formation occurs as a result of misdirected cell fate decisions within the affected tissue. HO can form both spontaneously and after injury to the muscle or other soft connective tissue. In addition to ligand-receptor signaling, mechanical cues derived from the physical environment also direct cell fate decisions, with stiff substrates promoting chondrogenic and osteogenic fates and softer substrates promoting neurogenic, adipogenic, and myogenic cell fates. We have observed increased activation of cellular mechanotransduction in progenitor cells harboring the FOP mutation. This proposal seeks to identify the influence of elevated BMP signaling conferred by the Acvr1R206H mutation on cellular mechanical signal transduction (also known as mechanotransduction) and how it affects the ability of muscle stem cells (MuSCs) to regenerate skeletal muscle after injury. I will first determine whether elevated BMP signaling in Acvr1R206H cells interacts with mechanical signaling pathways to alter response to substrate stiffness leading to aberrant cell fate decisions by mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) (Aim 1). I will also investigate the effect of the Acvr1R206H mutation on the ability of a muscle tissue cell population, muscle stem cells (MuSCs), to repair damaged skeletal muscle tissue (Aim 2). While FOP is a rare genetic disease, HO is a common pathological response to severe tissue trauma scenarios such as blast-initiated injuries and joint- replacement surgeries. Developing a better understanding of HO from a genetic perspective could provide insight into the aberrant mechanisms regulating bone formation and provide targets for pharmaceutical intervention in both genetic and non-genetic causes of HO. Additionally, insights gained from this study will provide us with a better understanding of cellular mechanotransduction and its role in muscle regeneration after injury."
"9349621","This proposal aims to explore and test a novel targeted oncolytic viro-cell therapy using the mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) infected by harmless common cold virus, the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) for treatment of lung cancers, which is the number one killer among cancers worldwide. Despite advances in the treatment and improvement in outcomes, the 5-year survival rates remain very poor (15% or less) for non?small cell lung cancers (NSCLC), which constitute ~85% of all lung cancer patients. Such poor survival rates combined with lung cancer heterogeneity and development of resistance to classical chemo- and radio-therapies, underscore the need for development of novel non-palliative therapeutic strategies. Though oncolytic virotherapies have emerged as a potential alternative to traditional chemo- and radio-therapies, their application to lung cancers remain limited. Also, inability to target oncolytic viruses to tumors in general remains a critical barrier and particularly for lung cancers remains a major unmet need. The motivation for the concept of targeted oncolytic viro-cell therapy against lung cancer comes from two major developments. First, MSCs, a cell-type generally known to have intrinsic tumor tropic properties, were found to be highly susceptible to RSV, with >90% infection rate, suggesting the use of RSV-infected MSCs for both tumor targeting and tumor killing. This potential was challenged by upregulation of indoleamine-2, 3-dioxygenase (IDO) by RSV-infected MSCs, which suppresses tumor immunity and thus aid in tumorigenesis. However, it was found that IDO- deficient hMSCs remain highly susceptible to RSV while alleviating the tumor suppressive effect. Second, nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) deficient (?NS1) RSV replicates with high viral titer in lung tumor cells, compared to the normal WI-38 diploid lung cells. Together these findings have led to the hypothesis that the ?NS1 RSV-infected IDO-deficient MSCs will retain tumor tropism and would lend themselves to develop a targeted oncolytic viro-cell therapy against lung cancers. This hypothesis will be tested in the following three specific aims. ! In aim #1, it is planned to develop and characterize a stable IDO-deficient hMSC cell line using the CRISPR method and examine the anti-tumor activity potential of wild type and engineered (?NS1) RSV-infected MSCs (RMSCs) in 3D multicell tumoroid cultures in vitro and biopsy-derived tumoroids ex vivo. In aim #2, it is proposed to assess the anti-cancer potential of RMSCs in vivo in immunocompetent syngeneic orthotopic model of lung cancer and evaluate their potential to modulate anti-tumor immunity. In aim #3 the effects of RMSC in modulating apoptosis induced by viral antigens will be investigated. Overall, the targeted RMSC therapy is expected to provide a highly innovative and effective approach for treatment of lung cancers. The PIs are uniquely positioned to conduct the proposed studies to develop a novel therapeutic approach for lung cancers, which may apply to other neoplastic diseases. All the required methods, reagents and collaborations are in place for the successful completion of this proposed program with highest clinical impact in the lung cancer field."
"9441930","ABSTRACT  Nearly 63 million people (20% of the US population) are eligible for VA benefits and services because they are veterans, family members or survivors of veterans. Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) contribute to significant morbidity and mortality of the military veterans and civilians (CDC/National Center for Health Statistics). I have been associated with VA and non-VA funded clinician-scientists and basic researchers for the past 20 years. I am also a VA funded investigator. The overall focus of my research as a VA funded scientist is to investigate the causal role of inflammation, inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, and NF-?B activation in CVD. Since inflammation is a critical component in the pathogenesis of CVD, and CVD are the major contributing factors for morbidity and mortality within both military veteran and civilian populations of both sexes, my studies are highly relevant to the VA mission. Furthermore, hypertension, diabetes, obesity and smoking predispose veterans and civilians alike to CVD, my ongoing studies are timely and critical in further understanding the pathophysiology of these chronic diseases. Using the most promising research strategies and problem-solving approaches, my goal is to identify newer therapeutic targets in CVD. TRAF3 Interacting Protein 2 (TRAF3IP2) is a cytoplasmic adapter molecule and an upstream regulator of at least three major signal transduction pathways that are known to play a pathological role in ischemic cardiac diseases. TRAF3IP2 activates IKK/NF-?B, JNK/AP-1 and p38 MAPK, and induces the expression of multiple cytokines and chemokines with negative myocardial inotropic effects. It also regulates the expression of collagens and MMPs. TRAF3IP2 is a critical intermediate in IL-17 signaling, another proinflammatory cytokine involved in ischemic cardiac disease. Our preliminary results show that TRAF3IP2 also plays a role in IL-18 signaling. In fact, we found that TRAF3IP2 binds the TIR (The Toll/Il-1 Receptor)-domain containing IL-18 receptor via binding motifs that appear to be different from those responsible for TRAF3IP2/IL-17R binding. Bioinformatics revealed that TRAF3IP2 could also associate with IL-1RacP (Interleukin 1 Receptor Accessory Protein), an IL- 1? receptor. We previously reported that TRAF3IP2 also plays a role in LPS/Toll-like receptor 4-mediated cardiomyocyte contractile dysfunction, suggesting that targeting TRAF3IP2 could blunt IL-17, IL-18, IL-1 and LPS signaling, all of which contribute causally to various cardiac pathologies, including cardiac ischemic injury. Utilizing both in vivo (genetic and interventional) and in vitro (cardiomyocytes and cardiac fibroblasts) models, my ongoing studies are examining the relationship between TRAF3IP2, inflammation and heart failure (HF) of ischemic/non-ischemic origin in vivo and the underlying molecular mechanisms in vitro. My long-term goal is to develop therapeutic strategies to inhibit TRAF3IP2 expression. Recently, we targeted TRAF3IP2 by UTMD (ultrasound-targeted microbubble destruction)-mediated delivery of AS-ODN into LV, and demonstrated significant reduction in cardiac TRAF3IP2 expression, myocardial injury (infarct size), adverse remodeling and HF development. In addition, my ongoing studies are focused on unraveling the roles of the RNA binding protein Larp6 (stimulates collagen I and III expression) and the membrane-anchored protein RECK (inhibits multiple MMPs, ADAMs, EGFR, uPA and gp130) in adverse cardiac remodeling and HF development. !!"
"9345678","Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a major renal disease that is associated with high mortality and prevalence. Recent work further indicates that AKI contributes to the development and progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD). However, the mechanism of AKI-CKD transition is largely unclear. Renal interstitial fibrosis is a key pathological event in maladaptive kidney repair following AKI and its progression to CKD. While interstitial fibrosis may involve various cell types in post-AKI kidneys, the tubular epithelium plays a critical role. It has been suggested that hyperactive signaling in injured or regenerating tubules may enhance the production and release of profibrotic factors that drive downstream events for renal fibrosis and AKI-CKD transition. But, it remains elusive how the profibrotic status of renal tubules is induced and maintained in post-AKI kidneys. Autophagy is a cellular process of cytoplasmic degradation that has recently been implicated in the development of renal fibrosis; however, the published data are controversial and the role of autophagy in post-AKI renal fibrosis is largely unknown. Our preliminary data show that tubular autophagy is induced along with renal interstitial fibrosis weeks after ischemia/reperfusion (IR) AKI. This is associated by the activation of hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1), a potential regulator of autophagy and fibrosis. In cultured cells, hypoxia induces the secretion of profibrotic factors in an autophagy-dependent manner. In the model of unilateral ureteral obstruction, blockade of autophagy results in the suppression of renal fibrosis. Based on these observations, we hypothesize that: Autophagy is induced via HIF-1 in renal tubular cells of post-IR kidneys. Upon induction, autophagy leads to a secretory phenotype in these tubular cells for the production and secretion of profibrotic factors, which activate interstitial fibroblasts to promote renal fibrosis. To test this hypothesis, the application will determine the role of tubular autophagy in post-IR renal fibrosis, delineate the involvement of HIF-1 in autophagy activation, and identify the key profibrotic factors that are produced in renal tubules in an autophagy-dependent manner for interstitial fibroblast activation. By elucidating tubular autophagy in post-AKI renal fibrosis, this application may lead to an in-depth understanding of AKI-CKD transition and the discovery of new therapeutic strategies."
"9565182","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Obtaining valid consent for the collection and storage of biospecimens and data for future, unspecified research use remains a significant challenge. Numerous studies have documented that research participants in a variety of settings-including biobanking-do not understand important aspects of the research to which they consented. To correct this problem, two major challenges must be overcome. First, there is no consensus on what constitutes 'adequate' understanding in biobanking consent, creating uncertainty about when valid consent has been obtained and hampering efforts to devise and assess interventions to improve comprehension. Second, the overall quality of the evidence concerning the effects of interventions to enhance comprehension is poor. Prior studies have suffered from small sample sizes, non-randomized designs, limitations related to the characteristics of the study population, questions about how 'comprehension' was defined and measured, and a narrow focus on only selected elements of the consent process. Given the ubiquity of biobanking research, there is a critical need to overcome these challenges by defining the threshold of knowledge needed to provide truly informed consent, and developing and rigorously studying interventions to promote comprehension in the context of a complete informed consent process. Our objective for this application is to develop and assess an informed consent process for biobanking that involves a simplified consent form and an interactive test/feedback procedure to enhance comprehension. To achieve this objective, we will pursue the following aims: (1) Systematically determine the threshold of knowledge needed to demonstrate adequate biobanking consent comprehension; (2) Refine a teach-back tool to improve comprehension during the biobanking consent process; (3) Conduct a national, multisite, randomized trial to determine the individual and combined effects of a teach-back intervention and a simplified consent form on comprehension in biobanking consent; (4) Explore the individual and combined effects of a teach-back intervention and a simplified consent form on secondary consent process outcomes. The expected outcomes include a systematically-developed definition of 'adequate' understanding and high quality data demonstrating the effect of improvements to forms and processes on biobanking consent comprehension, as well as model consent forms, teach-back tools, and measures that could be readily adapted for use in any biobanking context."
"9591306","Adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL) like most T-cell neoplasms is in dire need of novel therapeutic advances. Typical of T-cell lymphomas, ATLL presents with multi-organ infiltration and extreme treatment resistance. Unfortunately, most ATLL patients die within one year of diagnosis and current drug regimens do not extend this dismal prognosis. ATLL is initiated by infection from a complex retrovirus, Human T- Lymphotropic Virus type I (HTLV-1). After initial infection, viral proteins expressed by HTLV-1, notably tax, transcriptionally activate expression of IL2 and IL2R genes resulting in lymphoproliferation by autocrine signaling. ATLL manifests after long latency but the tax gene is usually deleted or silenced by methylation. Thus, in late stage disease, the viral stimulus of IL-2 signaling is gone but leukemic cells remain hyper- responsive to cytokines that utilize the IL2R common gamma chain (IL2RG), suggesting a role for host factors in tumor progression. In support of this idea, we recently discovered gain of function mutations in JAK3 in 11% of ATLL patients and also noted frequent overexpression and kinase activation. JAK3 is a non-receptor tyrosine kinase that binds with IL2RG to transduce signals from multiple cytokine receptors (IL2R, IL4R, IL7R, IL9R, IL15R, and IL21R) upon ligand binding. Importantly, cell lines dependent upon mutant JAK3 are sensitive to tofacitinib, a specific JAK3 inhibitor currently being tested in patients with autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis. Tofacitinib has been reported to have efficacy in phase III trials of rheumatoid arthritis and is the first such compound nearing approval. In Aim 1, we will investigate the in vivo role of mutant JAK3 expression using bone marrow transduction and transplantation experiments. We will test the cooperativity of mutant JAK3 with Cdkn2a-/- and the viral tax oncogene. In Aim 2, we will treat JAK3- induced lymphomas with tofacitinib, a specific JAK3 inhibitor. In Aim 3, we will explore how negative regulators of the JAK3 pathway may be involved in ATLL pathogenesis. Our aims are well-timed and can have a significant impact on a disease that is universally fatal upon diagnosis and advance our understanding of JAK3?s role in T-cell neoplasia."
"9312139","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Cognitive dysfunction in the aging Veteran population is a growing health concern in the Veterans Health System. While neurodegenerative disorders, like Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and Multiple Sclerosis have received considerable attention as potential etiologies for dementia, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), that also produces significant neurocognitive sequelae remains unrecognized as a cause. This is surprising given that the prevalence of sleep apnea in elderly Veterans has been estimated to be up to 40%. Moreover, chronic lung disease, particularly COPD, is now also thought to contribute to cognitive decline possibly through hypoxic injury to the brain. However, it is not known whether OSA coexisting with COPD will enhance the risk for cognitive dysfunction. Thus, we sought to investigate whether these two highly prevalent diseases, that often co-exist as the 'Overlap Syndrome', combine to enhance cognitive impairment in the elderly Veteran population. Additionally, treatment of OSA with positive airway pressure (PAP) has been shown to improve neurocognitive function in moderate-to-severe OSA while cognitive decline in COPD may be reversible through treatment with long-term oxygen therapy. Thus, it is conceivable that developing treatment strategies that target the pathophysiological underpinnings of the Overlap Syndrome, aimed at repairing hypoxia and arousal-induced 'brain injury', will allow recovery of neurocognitive function. Specific Aim 1 will investigate whether elderly Veterans with the Overlap Syndrome have increased neurocognitive deficits compared with OSA or COPD alone. Specific Aim 2 will further study the Overlap Syndrome group to determine whether treatment with CPAP and supplemental oxygen vs. CPAP alone will improve neurocognitive function and reduce sleepiness in conjunction with improved quality of life. Thus, using a novel dual-pronged strategy we hope to eventually delay the onset of dementia in a high-risk Veteran population. This pilot project will allow us to determine feasibility and sample size for a future larger long-term trial. Ultimately, our goal is to enhance rehabilitation and recovery from injury caused by two chronic conditions and thus, improve the overall health and quality of life of elderly Veterans."
"9467119","Project Summary The rising prevalence of obesity in developed countries has shown no signs of abating, putting society under monumental strain. The burden is both monetary and health-related, as obesity is a strong risk factor for the development of type II diabetes and its associated complications: coronary heart disease and stroke. Great progress has been made in our understanding of the pathology of obesity-related diseases, yet it is becoming clear that new approaches are needed to find pharmacological targets to treat metabolic dysfunction in a more effective way and with less side effects. One such approach is to target the function of adipose tissue, the organ at the forefront of metabolic disturbances in obesity. Adipose tissue produces a number of secreted factors that have profound effects on systemic metabolism. Most notably, adiponectin (Apn), which has been shown to have positive effects on insulin sensitivity and inflammation in obese mice. In fact, serum adiponectin is reduced in the obese state, an effect that has been shown to contribute to obesity-associated disease. To date, it has been challenging to find a practical way to harness the benefits of adiponectin. We have recently uncovered a regulatory mechanism that functions to limit adiponectin expression in adipocytes. In this project, I propose that if we can further understand this mechanism, we can find new therapeutic avenues to restore diminished adiponectin levels in obesity and, along with that, enhance systemic insulin sensitivity and reduce inflammation. We have generated the first transgenic mouse model that allows us to inducibly overexpress adiponectin in any tissue. Induction of Apn mRNA in liver or kidney resulted in the expected increase in serum Apn. Interestingly, induction of Apn in adipose tissue resulted in a decrease in serum Apn. Herein, I will detail this preliminary data and the experimental design to characterize this mechanism that restrains Apn expression specifically in the adipocyte and determine the efficacy of restoring Apn after the onset of obesity for enhancing insulin sensitivity."
"9347178","ABSTRACT Cerebral small vessel disease (SVD) affects over half of Americans over 65 and is a major risk factor for stroke and dementia. Although the pathological changes in blood vessels in SVD have been described for decades, the precise molecular defects are unclear. CADASIL is the most common inherited form of SVD and is caused by mutations in NOTCH3. We investigate the pathogenesis of CADASIL as a potential window into uncovering targetable mechanisms of vascular degeneration of the brain. Molecular mapping of affected families has provided important clues to the molecular pathways leading to arterial degeneration in CADASIL. The SVD-causing mutations in NOTCH3 either create or delete one cysteine residue, supporting the hypothesis that disulfide dependent conformational alterations in NOTCH3 trigger pathology of brain small vessels. In new preliminary data, we use a set of new NOTCH3 antibodies, including monoclonal probes, that bind to conformations of NOTCH3 that are strongly expressed in pathologically affected CADASIL arteries. These antibodies specifically bind to reduced NOTCH3 protein; other denaturants fail to induce the CADASIL conformational change. Site-directed mutagenesis of NOTCH3 demonstrates that the CADASIL conformation of NOTCH3 is generated after mutation of multiple cysteines, leading us to hypothesize that the unique NOTCH3 protein expressed in CADASIL results from reduction of more than one disulfide bond. We call this protein Multiple Reduced Cysteine NOTCH3 (mrc-N3). The experiments of this proposal aim to characterize mrc-N3. We propose to test the following hypotheses (Figure 1): (1) mrc-N3 is generated from reduction of at least two disulfide bonds and genesis of mrc-N3 is facilitate by NOTCH3 binding proteins from the vessel wall; (2) mrc-N3 activates transcription of disease related proteins and triggers smooth muscle cell stress pathways; (3) mrc-N3 functions in vivo to cause vascular dysfunction and pathology. These Aims will be tested using biochemical techniques incorporating purified NOTCH3 proteins, cell culture using primary human cerebral smooth muscle, pathological analysis of unique tissue resources available to our lab, and in vivo testing of mrc-N3 function in genetically modified mice. Successful execution of these studies will shed new light on key molecular mechanisms of small vessel disease."
"9562766","DESCRIPTION: The present application aims to discover multimeric HIV-1 integrase (IN) inhibitors or MINIs. HIV-1 IN multimerization presents an important therapeutic target as the ordered multimeric state is essential for virus replication. The principal objective of our studiesis to impair IN function by stabilizing rather than destabilizing interacting IN subunits to promote aberrant protein multimerization. Our initial proof-of-concept experiments have laid a strong foundation for the feasibility of our approach. We have demonstrated that a small molecule can inhibit IN catalytic activity in vitro by binding at the protein dimer interface, stabilizing the interacting subunits and promoting formation of higher-order oligomers. More recent studies with multifunctional quinoline compounds have demonstrated that these compounds potently target IN multimerization in infected cells. However, the application of quinoline compounds as investigational probes is limited due to the fact that they promote aberrant IN multimerization and inhibit the IN-LEDGF/p75 binding with similar potency. Therefore, new more selective compounds are needed to explore the roles of HIV-1 IN multimerization in the virus life cycle. Accordingly, we propose the following three aims: Aim 1 will rationally develop MINIs and elucidate their antiviral mechanism of action; Aim 2 will investigate IN resistance mutations that arise from treatment of HIV-1 in cell culture with MINIs and develop second generation inhibitors; Aim 3 will focus on discovery of new MINIs through high-throughput screening (HTS) of a library of 365,000 compounds and subsequent hit-to-lead optimization. The proposed studies will develop novel, powerful investigational probes (MINIs) to study HIV-1 molecular biology by selectively targeting IN multimerization. In addition, MINIs are expected to target previously unexploited sites on HIV-1 IN and potently inhibit HIV-1 phenotypes resistant to all currently used HAART. Thus, our studies will facilitate the development of clinically useful new types of allosteric IN inhibitors."
"9348921","Work Accomplished/Background: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common disease of aging that causes motor symptoms such as slow movement and tremor, as well as non-motor symptoms, such as cognitive difficulties and constipation. Non-motor symptoms can precede the development of motor symptoms by years?this observation has led to the hypothesis that PD has a long ?preclinical? period during which cells in the brain and peripheral nervous system are damaged, but the damage has not exceeded a threshold for motor symptom expression. We do not have validated methods to detect this ?preclinical? disease stage. Due to the long timecourse of PD, such biomarkers will be critical to evaluate the effects of new therapies as they become available.  Using sophisticated magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques that are sensitive to changes in the brain microstructure, we have shown differences between the brains of PD subjects and age-matched healthy controls. One such technique, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), estimates the direction and magnitude of water movement inside and around nerve cells in the brain. Another technique, multicomponent relaxometry, is able to quantify the amount of water trapped inside the layers of the onion-like myelin sheaths that insulate nerve cells. In the past four years of our VA-funded research program, we have shown both diffusion and myelin measures to differ in PD patients in comparison to healthy controls. We hypothesize that these microstructural differences may be detectable in preclinical disease, and may predict ?conversion? from preclinical to clinical PD.  For this proposal we plan to study two populations at higher than background risk for PD: Veterans who have been exposed to Agent Orange (AO) during service in Vietnam and have reduced sense of smell (hyposmia), and persons with rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (RBD), a condition that causes sleepers to act out their dreams. Objectives: (1) To evaluate the regional distribution and degree of microstructural difference in the brains of Veterans with high, medium, and low risk for the development of PD; (2) compare the rate of change in MRI microstructural measures between these groups; (3) determine to what degree microstructural measures predict the emergence of additional symptoms of PD (such as subtle motor impairment), or conversion to PD. Methods: This 4-year project will prospectively recruit a cohort of 135 Veterans with RBD, AO exposure with hyposmia, and AO exposure with normal olfactory function. Veterans will be recruited through the busy local VA sleep laboratory, while Veterans with AO exposure will be contacted through the National AO Examination Registry. AO-exposed Veterans will be mailed a standardized test of smell acuity as well as a sleep questionnaire, which will be used to select persons to join the study. Study procedures will include a brain MRI as well as detailed analyses of cognition and learning, movement speed, and walking ability (gait analysis). We will use these specific measures to divide our participant group into persons with low, medium, and high risk for the development of PD. Brain MRI microstructural measures and longitudinal changes within these measures will then be compared between groups. Significance for Veterans: PD currently affects 80,000 VA patients, and this number is expected to grow as Veterans who served in the Vietnam era enter peak ages for onset of the disease. This project will be the next step in understanding how PD progresses through the brain in vivo and in developing new MRI biomarkers to be used in clinical trials."
"9352519","Abstract Glomerulosclerosis is one of the hallmarks of end stage kidney disease and it is characterized by the replacement of the glomerular tissue with extracellular matrix components (mainly collagens) leading to the loss of functioning glomeruli. The goal of this grant is to investigate the molecular mechanisms that underlie the modulation of collagen turnover in injured glomeruli to devise more effective therapies to prevent glomerulosclerosis. Although many pathways have been implicated in both initiation and progression to glomerular fibrosis, we focus on the collagen binding receptor integrin ?1?1 (Itg?1?1). This receptor plays an anti-fibrotic action by recruiting and activating the tyrosine phosphatase TCPTP thus downregulating the phosphorylation of pro-fibrotic receptors, including the EGF receptor (EGFR). Moreover, Itg?1?1 negatively regulates collagen levels at both transcriptional and translational levels. Recently, we started to investigate the mechanisms whereby Itg?1?1 controls collagen synthesis at the nuclear level. As nuclear translocation and activation of many transcription factors and/or ribonucleoproteins are regulated by tyrosine phosphorylation, we analyzed the levels of tyrosine phosphorylated nuclear proteins in wild type and Itg?1KO mesangial cells to identify proteins tyrosine phosphorylated only in Itg?1KO cells. We identified the ribonucleoprotein Fused in Sarcoma (FUS) as a candidate. We show that in Itg?1KO mesangial cells, increased levels of total and tyrosine phosphorylated nuclear FUS are associated with increased collagen production and downregulation of FUS decreases collagen synthesis. Interestingly, FUS contains two tyrosines that can be phosphorylated by EGFR and dephosphorylated by TCPTP and the levels of nuclear FUS are associated with levels of activated EGFR. Based on these observations and the finding that FUS is upregulated in injured human and mouse kidneys, we propose that FUS is a positive regulator of collagen synthesis and plays a pro-fibrotic action in the course of glomerulosclerosis. We hypothesize that Itg?1?1 negatively regulates FUS tyrosine phosphorylation and function in an EGFR-dependent and - independent manner. Thus, Itg?1?1-mediated dephosphorylation of FUS represents an important, but previously undescribed mechanism to selectively reduce FUS activation and consequent progression to fibrosis. The aims of this grant are designed to define the contribution of FUS to glomerular disease and to determine whether blocking its function is beneficial for the treatment of glomerulosclerosis. In Aim 1 we will determine in vitro the mechanisms whereby FUS transcriptionally controls collagen production and determine whether inhibiting FUS ameliorates collagen synthesis. In Aim 2 we will determine the role of FUS in the progression to glomerular injury using a genetic and pharmacological approach. We will investigate the response of wild type and Itg?1KO mice crossed with global FUSKO mice, as well as mice overexpressing wild type FUS or mutated FUS no longer able to translocate to the nucleus to glomerular injury. We will then translate the relevance of these findings to a more clinically relevant setting, by investigating the response to glomerular injury in wild type and Itg?1KO mice untreated or treated with newly generated cell-penetrating peptides able to prevent FUS nuclear translocation. Understanding how the ribonucleoprotein FUS controls collagen production in glomerulosclerosis and exploring the consequences of its inhibition based on innovative delivery of nuclear transport modifiers will offer an entirely novel approach for the treatment and, ideally, prevention of glomerulosclerosis."
"9347793","Musculoskeletal extremity injuries comprise ~50% of all combat wounds for OIF/OEF/OND Veterans. Blast injuries via improvised explosive devices account for over 75% of combat casualties, with survivors experiencing severe orthopedic injuries. These types of orthopedic injuries often result in delayed or non-union, wherein normal bone healing is impaired. Current interventions for non-union fractures, particularly atrophic non-union fractures are rarely successful. OIF/OEF/OND Veterans are also at a high risk for depressive and depressive-associated disorders including post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), resulting in >60% of this population being prescribed antidepressants, specifically selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). While the effects of SSRIs on fracture healing are unknown, it has been shown that Sertraline (Zoloft) and Paroxetine (Paxil), first-line SSRIs for pharmacological treatment of these disorders, negatively affect bone health. Given the prevalence of complex orthopedic injuries, the long-term complications from these injuries, and the commonness of SSRI use in the OIF/OEF/OND Veteran population, there is a need for new therapies (e.g., cell-based therapies) that may overcome current clinical limitations for complicated fractures.  Our studies using a unique clonal cell transplantation model in conjunction with murine fracture models has identified the hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) as a novel progenitor for osteoblasts, osteocytes, and chondrocytes during fracture repair. Recent studies show HSC-derived osteoprogenitors directly give rise to bone in vivo. These findings are paradigm shifting in that most studies focus on the use of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) for musculoskeletal injury repair and suggest a benefit of HSC-based therapies for complicated fracture. Building on our previous MERIT studies, which demonstrated a role for bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2), BMP-9, and insulin-like growth factor (IGF-2) in promoting osteogenesis from the HSC, we have now shown a combination of IGF-2+BMP-9 results in enhanced osteoinduction from HSC-osteogenic precursors. We have also identified HSC-derived circulating osteogenic progenitors (COPs) that increase in blood during normal fracture repair and are mobilized with AMD3100 delivery, suggesting a potential therapeutic modality. Our preliminary data also demonstrate that SSRI administration in vivo leads to impaired bone healing, results in altered osteogenic profiles during healing, and inhibits osteoinduction from HSC-progenitors in vitro.  We hypothesize that HSC-derived osteo-chondrogenic progenitor cells may be targeted to enhance repair of complicated fractures. Our goals are to examine the ability of HSC-derived osteo-chondrogenic progenitors (compared to MSCs) to serve as a therapeutic modality during complicated non-union fractures and fractures during SSRI administration, uncover the mechanisms by which these cells may have a beneficial effect, and elucidate the effects of SSRIs on this unique population of progenitor cells. Specific Aims are to determine 1) if modulation of HSC-derived osteo-chondrogenic precursors in vivo promotes healing in a model of atrophic non-union and 2) if SSRIs impair fracture healing via inhibition of HSC-derived osteogenic precursors.  These studies are significant in that they challenge existing dogma by suggesting a novel HSC origin for bone cells and innovative in that they will determine the potential of exploiting HSCs to enhance healing in cases of complicated fracture. Findings from this study are easily translated to clinic (HSC mobilization is FDA approved for other applications) and have the potential to directly impact Veteran Health Care. Understanding how SSRIs affect bone healing and specific stem cell compartments may have tremendous clinical impact given the large number of injured Veterans prescribed SSRIs. This work will have far-reaching benefit for military personnel and Veterans at high risk for complicated fracture, specifically those of OIF/OEF/OND being treated for clinical depression and/or PTSD using an SSRI, and thus, is highly relevant to the VA Mission."
"9394412","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Striatal cholinergic interneurons (SCIs) and basal forebrain cholinergic projection neurons (BFCNs), which together encompass all forebrain cholinergic neurons, are required for neuromodulation throughout the forebrain. However, both the specification and diversity of these neurons are poorly understood. The precursors for all forebrain cholinergic neurons are born in the same region of the embryonic brain, and it is not known how these cholinergic precursors ultimately develop into diverse populations of interneurons and projection neurons. Although there is phenotypic diversity within SCIs and BFCNs, the developmental origins of this diversity has not been characterized, nor are there molecular markers to define the subclasses of cholinergic neurons that embody this diversity. This project aims to address these questions. There are two primary goals of this project: 1) to link the properties of mature forebrain cholinergic neurons with properties of their precursor cells, and to use this information to understand how they give rise to distinct classes of forebrain cholinergic neurons; and 2) to characterize the transcriptional cascades that give rise to the diversity of forebrain cholinergic neurons, particularly those that distinguish cholinergic interneurons and projection neurons. These goals will be accomplished through a combination of genetic fate mapping, transcriptional profiling, and assessment of candidate transcription factors in vitro and in vivo. At the conclusion of this study, a framework for classifying forebrain cholinergic neurons beyond their anatomical location and morphology will have been developed, and this classification scheme will be linked to their development. Furthermore, key genes in the transcriptional cascades during development that distinguish cholinergic interneurons and projection neurons will be identified. This will both improve our understanding of what is required for the normal development of the forebrain cholinergic system and provide us with genetic tools to specifically study and manipulate discrete populations of cells within this system."
"9378103","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The onset of clinical heart failure (HF) is associated with poor prognosis even today, and unfortunately the incidence of HF is projected to continue to increase in the coming decades. Therefore, organizations such as the American College of Cardiology (ACC) and American Heart Association (AHA) have identified the prevention of HF as a major need and therefore have commenced efforts aimed at preventing HF. Early initiatives included a new system of HF classification which identified at risk individuals as Stage A (those with risk factors such as hypertension and diabetes) or Stage B (those with some structural myocardial changes [for example, left ventricular hypertrophy] but without manifest HF). However, such systems of classification identified the majority (~65-75%) of a middle-aged population as Stage A or B. Recently we have shown that HF risk prediction can be improved using cardiac troponin T measured with a novel high-sensitivity assay (hs-cTnT) and N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP). Furthermore, hs-cTnT seems to identify individuals at higher risk among those with established risk factors (such as hypertension) for HF. In preliminary results, we have shown that individuals with systolic blood pressure of 120- 129 mm Hg and elevated hs-cTnT have a higher rate of incident HF than those with systolic blood pressure of 150-159 mm Hg and undetectable hs-cTnT. Therefore, we believe that by using hs-cTnT to estimate HF risk we can identify individuals in whom aggressive modification of risk factors such as high blood pressure will be associated with a favorable risk-benefit ratio. Our objective/specific aim therefore is to evaluate if treatment of selected subjects with Stage A or B HF (i.e., those with hs-cTnT >5 ng/L and an estimated 10-year HF hospitalization risk of >5%) who have reasonably well- controlled blood pressure with antihypertensive agents (carvedilol or spironolactone) will be associated with improvement of surrogate markers associated with incident HF (i.e., speckle-tracked cardiac and vascular strain). Carvedilol and spironolactone were chosen for the following reasons: a) they are not routinely used as first-line antihypertensive agents; b) beta-blockade was associated with decreases in hs-cTnT in our preliminary analysis of subjects with established HF; and c) the mechanism of actions of carvedilol and spironolactone provide a sound scientific rationale for use in prevention of HF. Using a prospective open-label blinded end point (PROBE) design, we propose to randomize 210 subjects aged >40 years with systolic blood pressure between 125-150 mm Hg, cardiac troponin T (measured with a novel high- sensitivity assay) level >5 ng/L, and 10-year HF risk >5% (estimated using a validated laboratory model including demographic factors, NT-proBNP, and hs-cTnT) to receive carvedilol (nonselective beta-blocker), spironolactone (aldosterone antagonist), or usual care for 18 months. The primary end point will be change in global longitudinal systolic myocardial strain estimated using 2D speckle tracking. Additionally, changes in vascular strain and biomarkers will be evaluated. This study will help us identify whether both or either of the medications can be further tested in large randomized clinical trials to prevent the incidence of HF."
"9522750","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Group B Streptococcus (GBS) remains a leading cause of invasive disease in neonates and certain adult populations including pregnant women. The development of GBS disease is initiated by the asymptomatic colonization of the female genital tract and during pregnancy can be associated with chorioamnionitis, puerperal endometritis and preterm labor. Approximately 20-30% of healthy women are colonized rectovaginally with GBS; the majority of infants born to these women will themselves become colonized with the bacterium. Newborn infection also results from ascending infection of the bacterium through the placental membranes to initiate infection in utero. In the United States national guidelines were published in 2002 that focused on a single strategy of universal screening for GBS carriage of pregnant women at 35-37 weeks of gestation plus intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis for all women who are carriers. However, current routine screening and antibiotic prophylaxis have fallen short of complete prevention of GBS transmission and GBS remains a leading cause of neonatal infection. This proposal seeks to investigate the ability of Streptococcus salivarius, a predominant member of the native human oral microbiota, to control GBS colonization. Preliminary studies suggest that the bacteriocin producing S. salivarius probiotic strain K12 limits GBS growth in vitro and in vivo. Using our established mouse model of GBS vaginal colonization, mice will be colonized with GBS and then treated vaginally with K12 to determine the impact on GBS vaginal persistence. Different treatment and timing regimens will be compared as will the role of bacitracin production and the impact on the host immune response. These studies will provide fundamental insights into the potential of using a probiotic bacterium as a preventative therapy to control GBS vaginal colonization and thereby prevent its transmission to the neonate during pregnancy."
"9378104","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         As a new addition to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual-5 (DSM-5), Hoarding Disorder (HD) is defined by persistent difficulty parting with possessions due to distress associated with discarding, urges to save, and/or difficulty making decisions about what to keep or dispose of. Clutter accumulates and fills living areas to prevent normal use of space, resulting in distress and/or disability. Hoarding symptoms cause significant impairment, increased medical problems, and poor quality of life for our Veterans, particularly our older Veterans. Providers treat Veterans for other medical or psychiatric complaints yet frequently miss an important source of disability and burden on our system. This insidious condition is costly to the VA system as patients continue to decompensate and need greater amounts of care over the lifespan. Given that over 6% of the population has HD, a higher proportion than are diagnosed with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder, further research on the mechanism and efficacy of an appropriate treatment is desperately needed.  Current behavioral intervention methods for HD range from ineffective to relatively small gains. Case management is typically used to treat HD, which produces inadequate outcomes and clients resurface in systems of care. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) for HD includes multiple components (assessment: 2-3 sessions, case formulation: 2 sessions, skills training: 2-3 sessions, combined exposure and cognitive therapy: 15-20 sessions, and motivational interviewing: throughout) and yields poor responses rates (i.e. <20% symptom reduction) in older adults. Outcomes in midlife HD patients are not much better, with symptom reduction rates ranging from 14-29% in HD symptoms following a lengthy course (4-9 months) of CBT for HD.  Executive dysfunction (ED) is linked to both HD symptom severity and poor outcomes of CBT for HD. Decision making, categorization, problem solving, inhibition, planning, organization, and cognitive flexibility difficulties are evident in HD patients across th lifespan, particularly in older patients. The VA has funded the development of an integrated behavioral treatment (Cognitive Rehabilitation and Exposure/Sorting Therapy; CREST) that targets both neurocognitive functioning and the core symptoms of HD (VA Career Development Award; Ayers PI). This treatment includes Compensatory Cognitive Training (CCT) to improve executive functioning and is combined with exposure therapy (ET) that targets avoidance of discarding/not acquiring. Preliminary results suggest that CREST is a highly feasible and acceptable treatment that doubles outcome rates compared to CBT for HD. Our proposed study will further develop this innovative intervention while testing whether it works through the mechanisms it targets and examining outcome moderators that may identify which patients are more likely to benefit.  We propose to conduct a randomized controlled trial comparing six months (26 sessions) of CREST to six months of ET alone, in 136 participants with HD. Assessments will be administered at baseline, during treatment (sessions 7, 13, 21), post-treatment, and 3 and 6-month follow-up. The primary objective is to evaluate whether CREST significantly reduces hoarding symptoms and improves functional capacity and quality of life when compared to exposure therapy alone. We will also examine the impact of treatment mediators; treatment adherence, changes in executive functioning, avoidance, and symptom severity on outcomes. Age and executive functioning will also be explored as potential moderators. Finally, by repeatedly measuring treatment targets, we will examine time to maximum treatment effect. By providing a treatment for many Veterans with HD, we can alter the course of their symptom trajectory and negative consequences, resulting in both reduced burden on the healthcare system and improved quality of life for Veterans."
"9378105","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Project Summary/Abstract:  More than eleven million (45.7%) U.S. Veterans are at least 65 years of age with up to 20% suffering from depression. Late-life depression is a common disorder which is often under-diagnosed and under-treated and has been associated with increased functional impairment regardless of symptom severity. Real-world effectiveness of antidepressants is sub-optimal or incomplete in up to two-thirds of patients with treatment resistant depression (Trivedi, 2006; Rush, 2006). Furthermore, common approaches for treatment resistant depression, such as electroconvulsive therapy and monoamine oxidase inhibitors, are not well accepted by elderly patients or risk significant side effects. Most alarmig, however, is the association between untreated depression and risk of suicide among the Veteran population with 69% of Veteran suicides are among those age 50 years and older. Faced with an aging demographic profile towards a higher proportion of elderly Veterans, evidence-based, effective, safe, and efficient interventions for Veterans with late-life treatment resistant depression (LL-TRD) are critically needed.  In collaboration with investigators at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine (MSSM), the study team recently completed a NIMH-sponsored randomized trial in patients with treatment resistant depression, comparing the immediate antidepressant properties of a single infusion of ketamine (KET), an open-channel nonselective N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist; to midazolam (MID), a benzodiazepine anesthetic. The results of this trial definitively affirmed the rapid antidepressant efficacy of KE. A data sub- analysis showed that older participant's response and remission rates were comparable to those of the younger cohort. However, the study was not powered to answer questions unique to the elderly population of a fixed KET dose. These findings provide the rationale for the current proposal of a single-site, randomized, triple- blind (patient, rater, and anesthesiologist) study. This novel strategy has not been adequately tested.  Seventy two Veterans age 55 or older will be randomized to receive a single infusion of KET (0.10 mg/kg, 0.25 mg/kg, or 0.5 mg/kg) or MID (0.03mg/Kg), following an adaptive randomization design. The primary aim is to identify and evaluate the durability of benefit of the best performing of the thre sub- anesthetic doses KET and midazolam Veterans with LL-TRD over a 4-week period. Innovative exploratory aims measure the effects of KET infusion on neurocognition, peripheral biomarkers of cellular plasticity and inflammation, and Pharmaco-electroencephalography. As the first randomized controlled trial of ketamine infusion therapy for elderly Veterans with LL-TRD, this proposal has the potential for a transformative impact on clinical practice. Irrespective of outcome, this project will generate valuable data supporting discovery research on NMDA receptor modulators for serious mood disorders."
"9450162","The development of myocardial remodeling and abnormal diastolic function are critical events that impact both functional capacity and the rates of morbid and mortal events in our Veteran population with chronic heart failure (CHF). CHF has a designated Quality Enhancement Research Initiative (QUERI) in the VA system to address ways to improve cardiovascular healthcare for Veteran?s suffering from CHF. Chronic pressure- overload (PO), produced by systemic hypertension, represents the most frequent cause of myocardial hypertrophy and diastolic dysfunction, and the most important risk factor for the development of heart failure, particularly heart failure with a preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). Our recent clinical studies in Veterans showed that the transition from compensated hypertensive heart disease (HHD) to decompensated HFpEF is associated with significant changes in diastolic properties including an increase in passive diastolic stiffness. Our translational studies in Veterans showed that one pivotal determinant of this increase in stiffness is an increase in interstitial collagen. Our studies in murine models of PO-induced fibrosis showed that one mechanism that controls changes in collagen accumulation is the time dependent production of the matricellular protein SPARC (secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine) and its regulation of post-synthetic collagen processing. Preliminary studies presented in this application support the hypothesis that myocardial macrophages serve a fundamental role in affecting the time-dependent increase in matricellular proteins that increases post synthetic collagen processing, collagen content, and myocardial stiffness in PO and contributes to the development of heart failure. This hypothesis will be tested with 3 Specific Aims. In Aim 1, the use of clinically relevant murine models of PO-induced fibrosis will be used to 1) determine whether increases in myocardial macrophages plays a causal role in driving post-synthetic collagen processing that results in myocardial fibrosis and diastolic dysfunction and 2) whether there is a time-dependent increase in myocardial macrophages after imposition of PO. Experiments in Aim 2 will determine whether cell-specific inhibition of SPARC expression in monocyte/macrophages versus targeted inhibition of SPARC in fibroblasts reduces and/or reverses PO-induced myocardial fibrosis and diastolic dysfunction. In Aim 3, studies to determine whether macrophage-dependent mechanisms driving diastolic dysfunction and myocardial fibrosis defined in vivo in Aims 1&2 play a causal role in fibroblasts isolated from PO hearts and in fibroblasts isolated from Veterans with and without HHD-induced fibrosis. The completion of these Specific Aims will lead to a better understanding of the molecular and cellular mechanisms that contribute to the development of diastolic dysfunction in PO and that lead to the transition to HFpEF. Elucidation of mechanistic factors that contribute to HFpEF are critical for improved methods of diagnosis and the development of better therapies to treat our Veterans with CHF, a significant unmet need."
"9378731","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):          Each year in the U.S. 200,000 people are diagnosed with abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) and 15,000 will inevitably die from rupture due to unrelenting expansion of the aneurysm sac. Consequently 40,000 elective endovascular or open surgeries are performed annually with morbidity rates as high as 23% and two-year costs up to $116K per patient treated in the Veterans Administration medical system. The risk of rupture accelerates with AAA diameter thus an effective therapy that could suppress AAA expansion would have a significant impact on patient survival, quality of life, and health care costs. Randomized, controlled trials with doxycycline, statins, and beta-blockers have failed to decrease AAA expansion rates and thus pharmacologic inhibition of AAA remains an unmet medical need. There is accumulating evidence that AAA is an autoimmune disease characterized by activation of the innate and adaptive immune systems. In patients with AAA we and others have demonstrated that circulating CD4+CD25+FoxP3+ T-regulatory cells (Treg) are significantly diminished in frequency and immune suppressor function whereas CD4+/CD8+CD28- T-cells and activated monocytes are increased in number and cytoxicity. In mouse models we have demonstrated that human mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) increase Treg frequency, promote their immune suppressor function by inducing expression of the transcription factor FoxP3, and inhibit AAA expansion. Our central objective in this Phase I randomized, placebo controlled clinical trial is t determine if the pathogenic immune responses implicated in AAA formation can be favorably modulated by administering MSCs in patients with small AAA (35-45. mm. diameter). The primary endpoint of Aim 1 is to assess the dose effect of allogeneic MSCs (1 or 3 million MSCs/kg) on circulating Treg number and immune suppressor function as compared to a placebo treated control group. The secondary endpoints are changes in frequency of Tr1 regulatory cells, CD4+CD8+/CD28- T-cells, changes in cytotoxic function (perforin and IFN-? activity), and frequency of activated CD45+CD14dim/-CD16++ monocytes. The primary endpoint of Aim 2 is to characterize the MSC secretome produced in response to patient specific signals in vitro and in vivo, specifically focusing on IL-10. Aim 3 will assess the effectof MSC administration on aortic inflammation by measuring 18-flurodeoxyglucose uptake with PET/CT and serum levels of matrix metalloproteinase-2 and -9 activity. Completion of this proposal will allow us to develop statistical power to calculate the sample sizes needed to execute a larger clinical study that will test the efficacy of MSCs in suppressing AAA expansion. Equally important, this proposal will be plenary in its definition of the mechanisms by which MSCs modulate immune responses in human disease and facilitate bedside to bench experiments that may yield more effective therapeutic strategies for AAA in the future."
"9494260","Project Summary/Abstract Participating in this three year grant will be allow the Erie County Health Department food inspection staff to achieve conformance with several of the Voluntary National Retail Program Standards, specifically standards 2,,4, 7, 8 and 9. Funds provided by the grant will be used to obtain inspection equipment and computers which will allow our staff to trend violations from standard inspection via computer software. Utilizing the trended data, our agency will partner with participating food operations in a newly created Active Managerial Control Program. Operators that join the program will be given tools which will aid them in conducting active managerial control actions within their facilities. After completion of the program the Erie County Health Department will trend violations to see if there is a reduction in critical violations as well as non-critical violations. A second component of the Active Managerial Control Program will include participants attending two Level 2/ServeSafe trainings free of charge. During this training, Active Managerial Control ideas and the benefits of Active Managerial Control will be discussed. Funds will also be used to create and distribute educational food safety materials to food operations within our jurisdiction. Finally, our agency will purchase and distribute food safety promotional items to the general public in various different events at high profile locations within the county in the final 2 years of the grant. The Erie County Health Department believes that participating in this 3 year grant will greatly reduce the number of violations that are most commonly associated with foodborne illness at our licensed food operations. The educational opportunities that the grant will afford this agency will also have a large impact on the general public, community stakeholders, and licensed facilities within our jurisdiction."
"9452448","Neurodegenerative diseases, including glaucoma, substantially alter quality of life of the affected Veteran. Glaucoma remains a leading cause of irreversible blindness. Currently affecting over 60 million individuals, this insidious optic neuropathy is characterized by a gradual loss of RGC neurons and is projected to impact nearly 80 million people by the year 2020. The prevalence of primary open angle glaucoma (POAG), the most common form of glaucoma, is approximately 1.86%, or nearly 2 million individuals, 45 years of age and older in the US. Despite being an extraordinarily significant socioeconomic burden to the DVA, the treatment of US Veterans with POAG remains limited and palliative. Current treatment options are restricted to non-specific interventions aimed at lowering intraocular pressure (IOP), a poorly-understood hallmark of POAG. For many glaucomatous Veterans, however, pharmacological and surgical management of IOP remains clinically refractive. The development of targeted therapeutic strategies directed at the cause of elevated IOP is critical for the advanced management of glaucomatous Veterans. In healthy eyes, IOP is maintained through balanced production and outflow of aqueous humor (AH). Increased resistance to AH outflow through the trabecular meshwork/juxtacanalicular tissue (TM/JCT) is a major contributor of aberrant elevation of IOP in POAG. The molecular mechanisms responsible for elevated IOP remain elusive, but most likely involve aberrant expression and signaling of transforming growth factor-?2 (TGF-?2). Numerous studies demonstrate that TGF-?2, a multifunctional cytokine that promotes TM cell contractility and increased extracellular matrix (ECM) synthesis and deposition within the TM, is markedly elevated in the AH of patients with POAG. While the cellular origin of TGF-?2 is unclear, we reported that human TM cells constitutively express and secrete active TGF-?2, highlighting the TM as a viable targetable source of active TGF-?2. Whereas the development of selective TGF-?2 downstream signaling pathway inhibitors continues to be the focus of intense investigations, targeted disruption of constitutive TGF-?2 expression and release from the TM represents an underexploited therapeutic strategy for the management of IOP in POAG. Numerous studies also report elevated levels of oxidative stress markers in AH of POAG patients, along with altered expression of antioxidant defenses in the TM. Selective oxidative damage to TM mitochondria (Mt) elicits TM cell dysfunction. Mt-generated reactive oxygen species (ROS) are required for TGF-? induced gene expression. Here, we present unpublished findings demonstrating Mt-targeted antioxidants significantly attenuate expression and release of TGF-?2 from cultured human TM cells. Collectively, a penultimate role of Mt-generated ROS in TGF-?2 mediated decreases in outflow facility and increased IOP in POAG begins to emerge. Hypothesis: Targeted disruption of constitutive TGF-?2 expression or signaling within the TM/JCT with mitochondrial-targeted antioxidant-encapsulating nanoparticles will increase outflow facility and lower IOP. The hypothesis of this study will be tested with the following three Specific Aims using a combination of ex vivo and in vitro established experimental approaches: Aim 1 will determine, ex vivo, whether perfusing human or porcine anterior segments with mitochondrial-targeted antioxidant-encapsulating nanoparticles will protect against experimentally induced decreases in outflow facility. Aim 2 will determine, ex vivo, whether perfusing human or porcine anterior segments with mitochondrial-targeted antioxidant-encapsulating nanoparticles will alter TM tissue integrity, endogenous TGF-?2 expression, or TGF-?2 mediated changes in ECM composition. Aim 3 will elucidate the mechanism(s) by which mitochondrial-targeted antioxidant-encapsulating nanoparticles alter TGF-?2 expression or TGF-?2 mediated changes in ECM composition in cultured human TM cells. Successful completion of the proposed study will serve as a critical first step toward developing this technology for the management of Veterans with POAG."
"9391609","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):      Objective: The study will examine the influence of immune function in older adults on improvement of muscle mass, strength, and function by resistance training. The maintenance of those benefits during long- term follow-up will also be examined. This objective will be accomplished by a double-blind randomized placebo-controlled trial of a nutritional supplement (Muscle Armor) which evidence suggests can improve immune function, promote muscle growth, and counteract muscle loss. The study premise is that aging results in decreased ability of the immune system to respond to stimuli such as exercise. The study proposes that the supplement will improve muscle health by promoting a shift in immune function of older adults from a pro-inflammatory state towards a state which supports muscle growth and maintenance. Research Plan: The study will randomize veterans (age 60-80, N=40) to participate in the supplement or placebo groups in a three phase study. The phases of participation correspond to the three specific aims. Aim 1 will determine if 2-weeks of supplementation improves immune function. Humoral immune function will be assessed as the response to vaccination. Innate immune function will be measured as systemic and cellular responses to acute resistance exercise that our previous studies indicate are affected by aging. Aim 2 will determine if supplementation during 12-weeks of progressive high-intensity resistance training boosts improvement in muscle size (CT scan), strength, and function (gait and balance). Muscle adaptations at the cellular levels will also be measured. Aim 3 will determine if continued supplementation for 26-weeks after completion of exercise training promotes the retention of the gains in muscle size, strength, and function. Multivariable testing will then be used to compare the results between Aims 1, 2, and 3 to determine whether or not immune function is correlated with muscle adaptation to training or detraining. Methods: Participants will undergo seven blood draws and five muscle biopsies of the vastus lateralis over the course of the study so that the effects of the supplement on immune function and cellular adaptations to training can be measured. Three of the blood draws will be used to assess the antibody response to the tetanus, pertussis, and diphtheria vaccine. Muscle and blood will be collected before and after a bout of exercise conducted before and after the 2-weeks of supplementation prior to training. Immune function will be measured using the blood based on pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokine levels, the balance between specific T-cell subpopulations, and the proliferative capacity of mononuclear cells. Immune function will be measured in muscle based on macrophage content of specific cytokines and growth factors. Our previous study showed that these muscle measures strongly correlate with size and strength gain after training. Key signaling pathways including nuclear factor-k B and PI3 kinase will also be measured. A fifth biopsy will be collected  post-training to measure adaptation at the cellular level based on changes in number of satellite cells and myonuclei and fiber size. Hypotheses related to these measures will be tested with 80% power to detect at least 0.8 standard deviations difference in means between the supplement and placebo groups. Clinical Relevance: Exercise is clearly able to affect immune function. However, the proposed study will attempt to modulate immune function and determine the effects on exercise outcomes. The study will also examine detraining, an important issue for older adults, that is usually omitted from training studies. Thus, the study will potentially advane our understanding of the mechanisms of muscle gain and loss in older adults, but more importantly, the study will evaluate a nutritional intervention as a complement to exercise for supporting muscle health during aging. Targeting the immune system may be the advantage needed for an older Veteran to successfully maintain or restore the muscle mass, strength, and function that is necessary for personal independence."
"9352512","Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) is a common cause of acute respiratory failure that carries a high mortality rate and has no beneficial targeted therapies. It is a pressing problem for Veterans and current estimates suggest that more Veterans will die from ARDS each year than will die from lung cancer. Despite this, there are no pharmacologic therapies for ARDS. New insights into the pathogenesis are needed to deepen our understanding of the underlying mechanisms that lead to ARDS as well as to develop novel therapeutics. A major pathologic feature of ARDS is activation of the Tissue Factor (TF) pathway of coagulation in the airspace. TF is an integral membrane protein that both initiates the extrinsic coagulation cascade and serves several non-coagulant functions including promoting cell adhesion and migration through interactions with integrin proteins. For decades, procoagulant pathways, including the TF pathway, have been implicated as a mechanism of injury in ARDS. However, a number of clinical trails of anti-coagulants have not shown a benefit with this approach. One potential explanation is that TF in the airspace is protective in ARDS. Our preliminary in vivo and in vitro data show that loss of lung epithelial, but not macrophage, TF causes loss of epithelial barrier integrity, decreased cell surface ?1 integrin and abnormal cell adhesion. Conversely, overexpression of TF in alveolar epithelial type II cells restores barrier integrity. In addition, treatment with recombinant factor VII (rFVII), the primary TF ligand, into the airspace attenuates permeability in a mouse model of ARDS. Together, these observations represent a major shift in understanding the role of the TF pathway in ARDS, a pathway that has almost universally been considered harmful. The goals of this proposal are to test the novel hypotheses that (1) loss of lung epithelial TF leads to loss of epithelial barrier integrity through disruption of integrin proteins and (2) upregulation of TF in the airspace maintain epithelial barrier integrity in a direct lung injury model. Therefore, local delivery of rFVII to the airspace could represent a unique therapeutic approach for the prevention and treatment of ARDS. Using novel transgenic mice with alveolar epithelial type II cell specific deletion or overexpression of TF we will define the in vivo cell specific mechanism of TF effects on lung epithelial barrier integrity. We will also use a novel TF knockout lung epithelial cell line to study the molecular interactions between TF and ?1 integrin and the role of TF in regulating epithelial barrier integrity by expressing a library of novel TF mutants. Finally we will use a clinically relevant human model of ARDS (ex vivo perfused human lung) to test the therapeutic potential of rFVII to tighten the epithelial barrier in human ARDS. Our experimental design is both mechanistic and translational and utilizes novel transgenic mouse models, cell lines as well a human lung injury model to both understand the mechanism of TF effects in the lung as well as to test the therapeutic potential of rFVII. This proposal takes advantage of the unique skills and resources available at Vanderbilt including state of the art computational modeling as well as adhesion complex dynamics measurements thus ensuring that results from these studies will advance the field and provide the necessary foundation for development of targeted therapeutics for Veterans with ARDS."
"9349005","Fibrotic and adipogenic infiltration is a hallmark of injured and aged skeletal muscle. This muscle fibroadipogenic degeneration (or ?MFD?) is responsible in part for the functional decline of skeletal muscle and the increased prevalence of metabolic disorders in aged individuals. The origins of the major cellular contributors (fibrocytes and adipocytes) of this MFD remain to be identified. Fibroadipogenic progenitors (?FAPs?), mesenchymal stem cells that reside in the muscle interstitium, are a leading candidate as they display robust fibrogenic and adipogenic potential in vitro and in vivo following transplantation. However, FAPs as undifferentiated progenitors are believed to have a positive influence on muscle regeneration and homeostasis. Thus, FAPs have been hypothesized to have either a positive or negative influence on muscle depending on their state. Studies in vivo to directly test these dual effects have been limited by the lack of specific tools to genetically label and target FAPs, and this has impaired our understanding of the biology of FAPs in their endogenous milieu. We have recently developed such tools by taking advantage of the highly specific expression of PDGFR? in FAPs among the mononucleated cells of muscle. Our Preliminary Data using a PDGFR?CreER strain that we developed to either genetically label or specifically deplete FAPs support the hypothesis that FAPs are essential for normal muscle regeneration (positive effect) and contribute to MFD under pathologic conditions (negative effect).  In the studies of this proposal, we will explore the biology of FAPS along several directions. In Aim 1, we will examine the contribution of FAPs to the cellular components of MFD during aging or during pathologic regeneration using genetic lineage tracing and genetic depletion. In the studies of Aim 2, we will focus on testing the positive role of FAPs in normal muscle regeneration and how changes that occur in FAPs with age may both contribute to age-related decline in muscle regenerative potential and also to age-related changes in muscle homeostasis. In the studies of Aim 3, we will examine the regulation of FAP fate determination, specifically focusing on the role of miRNAs as determinants of lineage based up on our Preliminary Data. We will screen for miRNAs that are important for driving FAPs down particular lineages or for maintaining those differentiated states, and we will test for the ability of specific miRNAs to maintain FAPs in their undifferentiated, progenitor state.  Through our studies of FAPs, we aim to understand the mechanisms that guide their activation in healthy muscle to assess their role in the fibroadipogenic pathology of aged muscle. Our investigation will both capitalize on new experimental tools to study this population and lend insight into therapeutic strategies to prevent age-related MFD. This will have direct relevance to Veterans who are suffering from skeletal muscle injuries, injuries that have limited their functional capacity and that, to date, have no hope of further recovery. This will also be directly relevant to our aging Veteran population, many of whom experience decreasing muscle strength and increasing muscle stiffness, limiting their normal activities. Our goal is to develop therapeutic approaches to enhance muscle repair and prevent muscle degeneration based upon a thorough understanding of the basic stem cell biology. These goals are based upon a firm commitment to a mission to improve the health and quality of life of Veterans whose function is limited by the lack of effective therapeutic options."
"9344921","Bile duct epithelial cells (i.e., cholangiocytes) are the target cells in cholangiopathies such as primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC), primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), and cholangiocarcinoma (CCA), which are characterized by the damage and proliferation of cholangiocytes. Cholangiocyte growth and remodeling are critical for the maintenance of biliary mass and secretory function during the progression of chronic cholestatic liver diseases. In cholestatic liver diseases, cholangiocytes, through the products of their cellular activation, are implicated as the key link between bile duct injury and the subepithelial fibrosis that characterizes chronic hepatobiliary injury. Targeting the factors that respond to the mechanical stress resulting from tissue injury may help limit inflammation and fibrosis that occur during hepatobiliary damage. Although mechanical stress such as occurs with biliary distention (commonly observed in PSC and extrahepatic cholestasis) activates cholangiocytes, the cellular and molecular mechanisms responsible for this activated neuroendocrine biliary phenotype remain unclear. There is a critical need to understand the triggers of cholangiocyte growth and their responses to damage during cholestasis, which will help identify key signaling pathways that represent viable targets for the development of effective therapeutic agents. Our long-term research goal is to develop an understanding of factors (such as mechanical stress) and signaling mechanisms regulating neuroendocrine biliary growth during cholestasis, which will provide a foundation for the discovery of prevention and new pharmaceutical interventions for cholangiopathies. Recent studies have indicated that apelin (APLN) plays a role in hepatic fibrosis and that the G-protein coupled apelin receptor (APJ) is also a mechanosensitive receptor. However, the role that APLN and APJ play in cholangiocyte pathophysiology is unknown. We propose the central hypothesis that the activation of the mechanosensitive miR-16APLNAPJ signaling is key for mediating the proliferative and activated profibrogenic biliary phenotype. To test our hypothesis, we propose three Specific Aims: (i) ligand-dependent activation of APJ stimulates cholangiocyte proliferation and activated neuroendocrine/profibrogenic biliary phenotype via Nox4/ROS/ERK-dependent downstream signaling; (ii) mechanical stress-dependent APLN synthesis induces cholangiocyte proliferation and activated neuroendocrine/profibrogenic biliary phenotype via downregulation of miR-16 and activation of the mechanosensitive APJ; and (iii) inhibition of the APLNAPJ axis and overexpression of miR-16 attenuates the activated neuroendocrine/profibrogenic biliary phenotype and fibrosis during cholestasis. Completion of proposed studies will provide a translational mechanism of how mechanical stimuli trigger local and systemic responses to mediate hepatobiliary fibrosis. !"
"9351814","Abstract  With our unique multi-component clinical sample and advances in Mass Spectrometry (MS), we hope to identify a combination of multiple biomarkers that provide discriminatory and accurate biomarkers of Alzheimer?s disease (AD) to advance earlier detection and treatment. Currently, the ratio of tau/A? in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is the best available biomarker for separating AD from normal subjects and predicting disease progression, but its sensitivity and specificity are modest. Our co-investigator (co-I), Dr. Lu, discovered that a pathologic conformation, the cis-form of phosphorylated pT231-tau (cis-ptau), contributes to AD pathogenesis. Similarly, oligomeric A? (oA?) is the most toxic form of A? to neurons, and we found that oA? was increased in plasma and brain tissue of AD patients. Our hypothesis is that detection of increased levels of these pathologic species (cis-ptau and oA?) will yield a robust biomarker for AD. Our team is uniquely positioned to test this hypothesis. We are the first group who reported MS-based proteomic profiling of three dimensional (3D) neuronal culture. We have analyzed candidate biomarkers from the plasma, induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) derived neurons, and post-mortem brain tissue from the same AD patients, which is unprecedented. We have analyzed brain tissue from 10 cases out of 20 AD, 20 MCI and 20 non-demented (ND) subjects from VA Bedford/Boston University Alzheimer Disease Center (ADC) Brain Bank (directed by co- I, Dr. Stein). Our biomarker detection capability is well-developed and we have in hand a clinically well- characterized set of plasma, CSF, and brain samples. We will validate novel biomarkers using the test samples of plasma and CSF from the same patients with early and moderate AD (20 patients) and 20 control ND subjects from Wisconsin ADC (samples are currently stored in co-I Dr. Lu?s lab). We will first determine whether CSF cis-ptau alone sufficiently separates AD from ND subjects. Next, truncated A? peptides will be measured along with cis-ptau to determine whether ratios of cis-ptau/A? in CSF provides a better separation of AD from ND subjects. Finally, we will quantify plasma cis-ptau and plasma oA?, and use a combination of plasma cis-ptau and oA? along with CSF cis-ptau as biomarkers for AD."
"9348722","Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is a devastating and fatal neurodegenerative disease that is characterized by progressive muscle weakness and eventual paralysis. The known risk factors for ALS are increasing age and male sex; recent data also implicate military service, thus putting an additional burden on the VA healthcare system. Approximately 90% of all ALS cases are classified as sporadic ALS (sALS) with no family history of the disease. The remaining cases are inherited in a dominant fashion, and mutations in ~30 genes (most commonly in C9orf72, SOD1, TARDBP, FUS) are currently known to cause ALS.  Hyperexcitability that stems from pathophysiological disturbance of glutamatergic transmission has been reported in all types of ALS cases, and may be a common disease pathway that predisposes motoneurons to degeneration. It has been suggested that the glutamatergic (Glu) deficit in ALS may result from altered function of the AMPA Glu receptors due to inefficient RNA editing of the GluA2 AMPA subunit. The GluA2 editing is catalyzed by the editing enzyme ADAR2. Our data, as well as data published by others, showed the downregulation of ADAR2 and inefficient editing of the GluA2 in the motor cortex of patients with C9orf72-associated ALS (C9 ALS) as well as in spinal motoneurons of patients with sALS. We also reported the downregulation of ADAR2 and the consequent decrease of editing in several of its targets in animals subjected to spinal cord injury (SCI). Moreover, in SCI these events are triggered by inflammatory response and result in changes in gene expression that are likely to contribute to post-SCI motoneuron hyperexcitability.  Based on these data and the fact that, as in SCI, neuroinflammation is present in ALS, we hypothesize that: (1) ADAR2 is downregulated in both C9 ALS and sALS, leading to alterations in RNA editing in its targets. In particular, in addition to GluA2, ADAR2 editing of other molecules which are important for neuronal excitability [such as, GluA3-4, kainate receptor subunits GluK1-2, serotonin 2C receptor (5-HT2CR), as well as potassium (Kv1.1) and calcium (Cav1.3) channels] is also altered in C9 ALS and sALS; (2) The downregulation of ADAR2 in ALS results from several different pathological features associated with the disease. Whereas the decrease of ADAR2 in sALS is triggered by neuroinflammation, the availability of the functional ADAR2 in C9 ALS is also influenced by its cytoplasmic retention, which is caused by a disruption of nucleocytoplasmic transport.  We will test these hypotheses by characterizing ALS-associated alterations (1) in the ADAR2 expression and localization and (2) in editing of the transcripts that are targeted by ADAR2. These studies will be performed in laser microdissected neurons obtained from autopsy tissues of patients with C9 and sporadic ALS (Aim1) as well as in motoneurons differentiated from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSC) derived from ALS patients (Aim2). In addition, previously published studies of ALS-associated transcriptional alterations employed whole (cellular heterogeneous) tissue specimens. However, because of the heterogeneity of cell types in the CNS, accurate assessment of the ALS transcriptome cannot be inferred from the data obtained from these specimens that combine signals from all cell types. Therefore, we will study cell- type-specific transcriptomes in C9 ALS and sALS (Aim3). These studies are enabled by the novel methods recently developed in our lab, and should enhance the likelihood of elucidating disease relevant variations, including those related to ADAR2 and editing.  Overall, this is an innovative proposal that builds on the interdisciplinary nature of our collaborative team to investigate RNA editing changes that characterize ALS and to define unique changes occurring only in C9 or sporadic ALS. Our goal is to advance the current knowledge and to discover new treatments."
"9467944","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The neurons comprising the ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus (VMH) are critical regulators of energy expenditure and peripheral tissue glucose sensitivity and are essential for metabolic adaptation to challenges such as high fat diet and exercise. The orphan nuclear receptor, Steroidogenic factor 1 (SF-1) is required for both the development of the VMH and for the expression of genes needed for metabolic adaptation. It?s universally known that exercise improves disease outcome apart from simply affecting weight, although how exercise improves neural metabolic regulation is largely unknown. Uncovering the molecular pathways leading to the metabolic improvements seen in exercise, may lead to new treatments to combat metabolic disorders. Recently our lab discovered that brain expression of the orphan nuclear receptor, steroidogenic transcription factor (SF-1) plays a critical role in metabolic improvements resulting from exercise. Exercised mice have increased hypothalamic expression of SF-1 target genes including Bdnf, Cnr1, and Crhr2. Additionally, mice with brain-specific loss of SF-1 show blunted exercise-induced improvements in adiposity, energy expenditure, endurance, fat mobilization, and skeletal muscle adaptation. However it is mechanistically unknown how exercise affect the expression of SF-1 target genes. Give that in adrenal glands, SF-1 transcriptional activity is modified through MAPK-dependent phosphorylation we posit that MAPK may also act in a similar fashion in VMH neurons. Exercise has previously been reported to increase MAPK transcriptional activity in the hypothalamus, however, it is unknown if VMH neurons are among the activated neurons. In this proposal we will use a combination of pharmacological and genetic tools ascertain if exercise induces MAPK-dependent phosphorylation of SF-1 in the VMH. Moreover, we will test if MAPK signaling is required for exercise- dependent gene expression of SF-1 transcriptional targets. Additionally, we will test if exercise affects the binding of SF-1 to the promotor of exercise-response genes. Uncovering the role of exercise-induced ERK signaling in the VMH may lead to new targeted therapies to combat obesity and diabetes."
"9587592","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In cochlear inner hair cells (IHCs), Cav1.3 L-type voltage-gated Ca2+ channels mediate Ca2+ signals that trigger exocytosis of neurotransmitter from IHCs onto auditory nerve afferents. This function of Cav1.3 is crucial for hearing: loss-of-function alterations in Cav1.3 cause deafness in humans and animal models. Cav1.3 channels exhibit distinct properties in IHCs compared to other cell-types, but little is known about what underlies these differences or their relevance for sound encoding by the IHCs. Filling this gap in knowledge is expected to reveal fundamental processes that are required for the unique role of Cav1.3 channels at this first synapse in the auditory pathway. The long-term goal of our research is to define the mechanisms that regulate voltage- gated Cav Ca2+ channels in order to discover what causes, and how to cure, human disease. To this end, we have identified new forms of Cav1.3 modulation in IHCs. First, we found that the cell-surface density of Cav1.3 channels in IHCs is controlled by interactions with harmonin, a protein implicated in the pathogenesis of Usher syndrome. Harmonin enhances degradation of Cav1.3 by the ubiquitin-proteosome (UPS) system, and this process is disrupted in a mouse model of Usher syndrome. Second, we discovered that CaBP2, a Ca2+ binding related to calmodulin (CaM), inhibits Ca2+-dependent inactivation of Cav1.3; this effect is impaired by a human mutation in the CaBP2 gene that causes autosomal-recessive hearing loss. Third, we found that Cav1.3 associates with RIBEYE, the major component of ribbon synapses in IHCs and other sensory cell-types. This interaction may regulate not only the localization, but also the function of Cav1.3 at the IHC active zone. Based on our findings, we hypothesize that the macromolecular assembly of Cav1.3 with proteins such as harmonin, CaBP2, and RIBEYE, dictate the strength and localization of Ca2+ signals in IHCs, and is therefore crucial for auditory transmission. The objective of this proposal is to test this hypothesis using molecular, genetic, and electrophysiological techniques. The rationale is that the proposed research will reveal essential signaling complexes that shape the synaptic function of IHCs, and how dysregulation of such complexes may contribute to the pathophysiology of inherited or acquired forms of hearing loss."
"9350874","Hyponatremia, a relative excess of total body water, is the most frequently encountered electrolyte abnormality. Although some instances are readily attributed to heart, liver, or kidney failure, many are unexplained. Water excess causes confusion, lethargy, seizures, and death. Even mild hyponatremia causes reversible deficits in coordination and cognition. The applicant's preliminary data show that the plasma sodium concentration is highly individual (i.e., relatively constant in any one individual) and is heritable. In a meta-genome-wide association study for common gene variants that influence water balance, the applicant and co-workers identified variants in a gene not previously suspected of playing a role in whole-body water balance, but exhibiting extremely high biological plausibility. The lead variant affects an intronic enhancer within the gene. Remarkably, a second association locus codes for the transcription factor predicted to bind this enhancer. Therefore, the overarching objective of this proposal is to demonstrate the centrality of this enhancer region, this gene variant, and this gene to systemic osmoregulation using a combination of in vitro and whole- animal models. In Aim 1, the functional significance (i.e., osmotic responsiveness) of the enhancer region and allele- specific effects will be probed through reporter gene and DNA binding assays. In Aim 2, the effect of downregulating this gene upon osmotic phenotype will be tested in cultured cells natively expressing the protein. In Aim 3, transgenic mouse models will be used to test the importance of this gene to systemic water balance under basal conditions, and in response to physiological maneuvers designed to perturb water balance."
"9532546","The overall goal ofthe research proposed In this application overall is to understand how the innate immune system regulates adaptive immune responses, and to harness this understanding in designing vaccines. The subject ofthe research funded by the present grant during the current cycle focused on the central problem of how/ the immune system launches robust immunity against invading pathogens, while maintaining tolerance to self. This problem assumes a particular significance in the intestine because ofthe trillions of commensal microorganisms and food antigens that confront the intestinal immune system every day. Recent advances suggest that DCs and macrophages play a fundamental roie in maintaining the balance between immunity and tolerance. The hypothesis ofthe application was that balance between immunity and tolerance in the intestine is a complex function ofthe subset of antigen-presenting cell (APC), the microbiota, and instructive signals from stromal elements. This hypothesis is being tested in the following specific aims: Aim 1; To determine whether distinct subsets of lamina propria DCs and macrophages differentially bias the class of innate and adaptive immune responses. Aim 2: To determine whether commensal bacterial flora regulate the functions of lamina propria DCs and macrophages and their ability to induce Thi 7 versus T regulatory responses. Aim 3 : To determine the innate responses of lamina propria DCs and macrophages to oral administration of adjuvants or vaccines, and the effects of such responses on the adaptive immune response. Research performed in each of these Aims have yielded exciting and unexpected results. Forexample, we have characterized the phenotypes, functions and regional localization of intestinal APC subsets, and defined a novel transcription factor that programs intestinal DCs to induce T regulatory responses. Future work is aimed at exploring additional transcriptional networks that program DCs and macrophages to a tolerogenic state. RELEVANCE (See Instructions): Understanding the cellular and molecular mechanisms by which DCs control T cell responses in the inestine and periphery will be of great value in the rational design of therapeutics against inflammatory disorders and vaccines against infections."
"9145866","RESEARCH PROJECT 2- PROJECT SUMMARY  The goal of this MUSC TCC project is to develop more precise biomarkers of prostate cancer initiation and  progression, and determine how to treat and manage prostate cancer among minority men within the context  of their biological risk for poor outcomes and social, psychological, and physiological (i.e., allostatic load/AL)  stressors. This will be done using several new innovative experimental approaches directly on archived tissues  unique to MUSC, using a rich resource cohort of samples (n=570) representing approximately one third African  American (AA) subjects. Based on the epidemiology of prostate cancer among AA men (already described in  the proposal), considerable efforts have been made to promote early detection through screening with  prostate specific antigen (PSA) testing. Recently, however, screening guidelines have shifted from performance  of annual screening starting at age 50 to informed decision-making as new data have emerged about the  efficacy of PSA testing. As early detection plays a less prominent role in prostate cancer control, it becomes  even more important to identify biological pathways that are activated in the initiation and progression of  disease and develop more effective biomarkers for early detection. Several prior studies have shown that  there is a complex interplay between the tumor microenvironment and the immune system that contributes to  the development of more aggressive prostate cancer among AA men. However, biological processes  related to immune functioning operate within and are influenced by social contextual factors. Thus, identifying  biological mechanisms without understanding the ways in which they are associated with social determinants  is necessary, but not sufficient to long-term efforts to reduce racial disparities in prostate cancer outcomes  through early detection and clinical management of disease. An emerging hypothesis central to this application  about cancer health disparities is that social conditions and psychological responses to social stressors  influence biological processes that are important to the initiation and progression of cancer. In this project,  MUSC investigators will examine this hypothesis through a transdisciplinary study that defines the molecular  mechanisms involved in the initiation and progression of prostate cancer by evaluating the tumor  microenvironment interactions between the immune system, the tumor glycome, social determinants and AL.  These investigators will determine whether the combination of distinct tumor and stroma N-glycans in prostate  cancers of AA men promotes a more pro-tumor inflammatory/immune microenvironment. They will also  examine the relationship between these biological processes and social determinants that include isolation,  perceived stress, and chronic socioeconomic stressors. They hypothesize that a combination of stress-  inducing social determinants, distinct N-glycans, impaired immune/inflammatory balance contributes to more  aggressive prostate cancers in the AA population."
"9349656","Recent advances in immunotherapy have completely transformed the treatment and prognosis of veterans with advanced melanoma. Checkpoint inhibition immunotherapy using anti-CTLA-4 and anti-PD-1 antibodies has introduced the possibility of cure for a disease that was once practically untreatable. Sadly, the majority of veterans with metastatic melanoma will still succumb despite treatment, and incremental improvements in efficacy have brought increasing risks of autoimmune complications. For veterans reaching the therapeutic limits of checkpoint inhibition, it is clear that a new generation of immunotherapy is needed. In this proposal, we examine an entirely different approach to melanoma immunotherapy. Our vision for this approach fuses a number of long-standing and recent observations in cancer immunology. It is well known that conventional oncological therapy and modern immunotherapy both heighten the immune response to cancer; conventional treatments like radiation or ablation magnify tumor antigen presentation by destroying tumor cells, and immunotherapy potentiates the activation of tumor-reactive T cells. The presentation of tumor antigens and the activation of reactive T cells occur, in large part, in the tumor-draining lymph node ? the front line of contact between cancer and the immune system. In our previous Merit Review, we learned that a combinatorial approach to immunotherapy using checkpoint inhibition with adoptive cell transfer generated a qualitatively stronger immunity to melanoma antigen. We also characterized the unique oncological advantages of tumor-reactive memory T cells over traditional effector T cells for adoptive immunotherapy. In recent studies, we have learned that the combination of effector and memory T cells is strikingly more effective than effector or memory T cells alone. Despite their enormous theoretical promise for immunotherapy, the practical utility of memory T cells is handicapped by the fact that they exist in vanishingly small quantities. Fortunately, some very recent observations have begun to shed light on the cellular metabolic pathways that determine whether activated T cells differentiate into effector or memory T cells; intentional redirection of these pathways can drive T cells toward either phenotype. Interestingly, the metabolic conditions that favor memory T cell development are inherently unfavorable for cancer cell survival. Just as importantly, we have discovered a technique for isolating and expanding large quantities of tumor-reactive effector or memory T cells using cytokine stimulation of lymphocytes harvested from tumor-draining lymph nodes.  We envision a new paradigm of melanoma immunotherapy. In this approach, local and systemic oncoimmunological therapies like radiation or tumoral ablation are used with checkpoint inhibition immunotherapy ? not simply to treat tumors, but to also magnify the activation of tumor-reactive T cells within tumor-draining lymph nodes. Next, local injection of nanoparticles carrying targeted modulators of T cell metabolism are taken up into tumors and peritumoral lymphatics ? exerting anti-cancer effects, while driving activated T cells in tumor-draining lymph nodes toward memory phenotype. Patients undergo a minor surgical procedure to excise these tumor-draining lymph nodes, and their lymphocytes are subjected to stimulation and cytokine stimulation protocols with targeted modulators of T cell metabolism to generate massive and parallel populations of effector and memory melanoma-specific T cells. These cells are adoptively transferred back into the patient, taking advantage of the cooperative benefits between checkpoint inhibition and adoptive immunotherapy. Our paradigm focuses on the tumor-draining lymph node, using oncoimmunological therapies to re-engineer this leading edge between cancer and the immune system into a natural generator of optimally therapeutic and personalized T cells. In this proposal, we outline a series of murine and human experiments that will establish the preclinical validity of this next generation of melanoma immunotherapy."
"9590248","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):        Atherosclerosis, which is regulated by inflammation, endothelial cell (EC) barrier dysfunction, and oxidative stress, is the major cause of aortic aneurysm (AA), and mortality in Veteran population. Copper (Cu), an essential nutrient, is involved in normal function while excess Cu contributes to inflammatory diseases including atherosclerosis with unknown mechanism. Since excess Cu is toxic, bioavailability of intracellular Cu is tightly controlled by Cu transporting ATPase (ATP7A) which obtains Cu from cytosolic Cu chaperone Atox1 and then delivers Cu to secretory Cu enzymes including ecSOD, or exports Cu to extracellular space. Our lab reported that vascular ATP7A-ecSOD axis protects against endothelial dysfunction in hypertension and type1 diabetes, and that Atox1 functions as a Cu-dependent transcription factor, when it localizes at nucleus. However, a role of ATP7A and its relationship with nuclear Atox1 in atherosclerosis is entirely unknown. Preliminary data suggest that ATP7A mutant (ATP7Amut) mice which have reduced Cu export function crossed with ApoE-/- mice accelerate atherosclerotic lesion and AA with excess inflammatory cells and vascular permeability vs. ApoE-/- mice. By contrast, Atox1-/-/ApoE-/- mice exhibit significant reduction of atherosclerotic lesion, suggesting that ATP7A is atheroprotective while Atox1 is proatherogenic. Of note, both ATP7Amut and Atox1-/- mice show the similar extent of reduced Cu enzyme lysyl oxidase activity mediated through Cu chaperone Atox1, which does not explain enhancing atherosclerosis or AA in ATP7Amut/ApoE-/- mice. Based on additional new preliminary data with ATP7A-depleted ECs, we will test the novel hypothesis that Cu exporter ATP7A downregulation by inflammation increases intracellular Cu that stimulates nuclear Atox1- mediated EC barrier dysfunction and ROS-dependent inflammatory responses. This in turn promotes excess inflammatory cell recruitment, which accelerates atherosclerosis and AA. Aim 1 will define the protective role of ATP7A against inflammation-induced endothelial barrier dysfunction and ROS-dependent inflammatory adhesion molecule expression, which contribute to leukocyte transendothelial migration (TEM) in ECs in a Cu- and Atox1-dependent manner. Aim 2 will determine how inflammation-induced accumulated intracellular Cu promotes endothelial barrier dysfunction and ROS-dependent inflammatory responses by focusing on Cu-dependent transcription factor function of Atox1 to upregulate miR125b that represses VE- cadherin as well as p47phox of NADPH oxidase that increases ROS-NFkB. Aim 3 will define the protective role of ATP7A against atherosclerosis and AA development via regulating vascular permeability and inflammation in a Cu- and Atox1-dependent manner in vivo. We will use ATP7Amut, ATP7A transgenic, Atox1-/- mice; or inducible EC-specific ATP7A conditional deficient mice crossed with ApoE-/- mice with high fat diet treated with Cu chelators or LNA-anti-miR125b. Moreover, Cu imaging analysis (64Cu labeling, inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) and synchrotron X-ray fluorescence microscopy (XFM)), live cell imaging, in vivo intravital microscopy, non-invasive Bioluminescence imaging using NFkB transgenic reporter mice will be used. Our study will provide novel insight into Cu transporter ATP7A or nuclear Atox1 as potential therapeutic targets for treatment of vascular inflammatory diseases such as atherosclerosis."
"9487845","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Approximately 50% of HIV positive veterans develop HIV associated neurocognitive disorders, or HAND, despite adequate anti-HIV drug therapy. The neurologic disease associated with HIV infection ranges from asymptomatic neurocognitive impairment, only detected by sophisticated neuropsychological testing, to frank dementia. In industrialized nations like the United States, retroviral pharmacotherapy has reduced the incidence of severe dementia due to HIV infection, but the prevalence of HAND has unexpectedly risen (especially among the milder forms). The reason(s) for this is unclear; however, new data suggest that the antiretroviral agents (ARVs) used to combat HIV infection may independently exert central nervous system (CNS) toxicities and contribute to this increased prevalence of adverse neurologic symptomatology. The milder forms of HAND are more common, more insidious in their onset and can detrimentally impact a veteran's ability to remain healthy and financially secure. Surprisingly, the direct effects of ARV on functional signaling of CNS neurons has yet to be examined. Through this funding, we have the opportunity to fill that knowledge gap. The majority of the accumulated evidence that implicates anti-HIV drugs as potentially involved in cognitive dysfunction is inferred from in vitr experiments involving sensory neurons or derived from clinical studies that are mostly observational in their design. Understanding the mechanisms of the potential adverse effects of our treatments for HIV is the only way to minimize their negative impact on health. The primary goal of the proposed research is to examine ARVs for CNS neuronal toxicity in the absence of inflammation or infection. This will be investigated through physiological, anatomical, and behavioral approaches. By determining mechanisms of neurotoxicity in preclinical investigations, we can begin to develop rational treatments for these complications of ARV therapy and to adapt pharmacologic regimens to involve less toxic CNS effects in patients with existing cognitive dysfunction. As HAND may first manifest as mild cognitive impairment in spatiotemporal memory tasks, our research efforts will focus on these cortical brain regions known to be closely associated with memory tasks. The underlying hypotheses of the proposed work is that despite their efficacy in reducing HIV load, certain ARVs clinically associated with peripheral neuropathy will also impair normal cortical neuron anatomy, physiology, and synaptic transmission and these neurophysiological effects will lead to measurable changes on memory-associated tasks either acutely or via chronic exposure. To test my hypotheses, I am proposing to subject a diverse subset of the ARVs (8 separate drugs) to a battery of in vitro and ex vivo experiments in order to determine the effects of these drugs on the dendritic branching, excitability, and network activity of cortical neurons; thus establishing a biophysical profile of  potentially toxic ARV. I will then validate biophysical predictors of neurotoxicity using in vivo behavioral testing of memory disruption. And then establish an efficient biophysical screen for ARV-mediated neurotoxicity using the simplest biophysical testing modality which predicts the most severe memory impairments measured in the whole animal. Finally, I will apply only the necessary screening tools to all of the commonly prescribed ARVs to streamline the method of neurotoxicity detection. Through this mentored award, I will extend my laboratory skills beyond my background in neurophysiology to include behavioral and neuroanatomical techniques. Once armed with the necessary toolbox, I intend to develop an independent science program focusing on translating pharmacological testing to guiding clinical decisions in the neurosciences."
"9293689","In FY2014, over 57,000 Veterans with diagnosed alcohol use disorders (AUDs) received VHA inpatient medical-surgical services. This likely underrepresents the prevalence of AUDs among Veteran inpatients, because these conditions often go undiagnosed during hospital stays. The high prevalence of AUDs among VHA medical-surgical inpatients is of critical concern because AUDs and medical conditions exacerbate one another, and their co-occurrence increases the use of costly health services. Yet, there are no evidence-based strategies that improve outcomes in this patient population by means of increased utilization (initiation, engagement) of AUD treatment services. We have identified Drinking Options: Motivate, Shared Decisions, Telemonitor (DO-MoST) as a potential solution to the critical need for evidence-based strategies.  This project will evaluate DO-MoST as a new and innovative intervention to facilitate the transition from inpatient medical-surgical care to AUD treatment in primary and specialty care settings, thereby improving Veterans' AUD and medical outcomes. DO-MoST entails use of motivational interviewing and a decision aid during the inpatient stay to facilitate informed choices about post-discharge drinking options and resources for help to change drinking, if desired, followed by telephone calls with the patient to continue to motivate and support decisions. In addition to determining the effectiveness of DO-MoST, this project includes a process evaluation ? that is, will gather information from providers and patients on DO-MoST's implementation at the two project sites ? to inform VA's potential widespread implementation of DO-MoST with medical-surgical patients with AUDs.  Using an effectiveness/implementation Hybrid Type 1 design, incorporating a randomized controlled trial (RCT) and process evaluation to facilitate future implementation, this project has three Specific Aims. Aim 1: Adapt a decision aid being implemented with AUD patients in non-VA primary care settings to be appropriate for Veterans with AUDs in medical-surgical inpatient settings. With this prototype, we will conduct alpha testing with patients and providers, and adapt and pilot the decision aid to finalize it for use in the RCT. Aim 2: Conduct DO-MoST at two VA facilities (Ann Arbor and Palo Alto) and evaluate its effectiveness. The primary hypotheses are: Patients in DO-MoST, compared to patients in usual care (UC), will be more likely to (1) utilize AUD help (initiate, engage), (2) have better AUD (fewer heavy drinking days) and medical (physical status) outcomes, and (3) have fewer and more delayed acute care episodes (Emergency Department visits, rehospitalizations). Patients will be assessed at baseline, and 3, 6, and 12 months post- discharge, for outcomes and non-VA health care; VA health care will be assessed with VA databases. GLMM analyses will be conducted to compare the UC and DO-MoST groups on course of outcomes. Aim 3: Conduct a qualitative process evaluation to inform the wider implementation of DO-MoST, using the RE-AIM (Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, Maintenance) framework. The purpose is to provide guidance for VA facilities' broader adoption of DO-MoST in the future, including its possible adaptation for diverse subpopulations of Veterans, such as patients with mental health diagnoses (e.g., PTSD).  In summary, this project will develop a decision aid and comprehensively examine DO-MoST as a novel and groundbreaking approach to providing a bridge between inpatient medical-surgical treatment and AUD treatment. Decision Aids have been used successfully in a number of contexts, but never with medical- AUD inpatients. Our operations partners from VHA Mental Health Services and Medical Service are committed to directly addressing the dangerous, costly pattern of Veterans obtaining inpatient medical-surgical services but not receiving the AUD treatment they need. The project is focused on priorities in the VA Blueprint for Excellence, of HSR&D Service, and of the PIs' HSR&D Centers of Innovation."
"9378721","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):          Allergic rhinitis is a common illness suffered among US Veterans. Despite the availability of medications, many patients fail to get adequate control of symptoms especially in high pollutant areas. Southern California air pollutants, like diesel exhaust particles may act as adjuvants to allergens leading to an exaggerated allergic response in certain individuals. These individuals may lack adequate Glutathione transferase activity; necessary to protect cells against pollutant induced oxidative stress. Sulforaphane has been shown to protect against oxidative stress. We hypothesize consumption of foods containing high levels of sulforaphane are beneficial to US Veterans with GST deficiencies suffering from allergic rhinitis. In our preliminary data, we discovered administration of broccoli sprout extract rich in sulforaphane leads to diminished nasal inflammatory reaction brought on by diesel exhaust particles though did not have sufficient patient numbers to prove an association with GST deficiency. We propose a 3 week randomized clinical trial comparing broccoli sprout extract consumption with nasal corticosteroid administration after subjects with allergic rhinitis undergo a Timothy, Bermuda or Johnson grass nasal challenge. In Aims 1 and 2, we will compare clinical (nasal symptom scores and peak nasal inspiratory flows) and laboratory (inflammatory cytokines, eosinophil cationic protein, tryptase) measurements between four groups: nasal corticosteroid, broccoli sprout extract, nasal corticosteroid plus broccoli sprout extract, and placebo. Aim 3 focuses on exploratory genetic analysis of the 3 glutathione S-transferase (GST) genes to determine if correlations exist between the inability to produce GST enzyme and the response to broccoli sprout extract. At the conclusion of this study, we will gain further knowledge of which patients benefit from anti-oxidant nutritional supplementation in treating allergic rhinitis."
"9349434","The soldiers that face combat are at high risk for the potentially significant repercussions of combat stress. Combat stress can lead to a number of impactful emotional and cognitive conditions, most notably Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD), and mild Traumatic Brain Injury (mTBI). While there have been attempts to match a specific neurobiological pattern to a specific DSM identified disorder, the pursuit has met limited success. Clinically, different DSM diagnoses are often approached with similar treatments with similar response rates (~33-50%). Clinically groups are identified my sets behaviors (DSM disorders) and research has aimed to find the neurobiological underpinnings of these behavior defined groups. Our aim is to instead identify neurobiological groups in the context of underlying neurobiological and with the long term goal of improving response rates to medical trials be clustering of relevant features. However, due to the complex relationship between the neurobiological variables a simple linear relationship or risk score is not appropriate. Here we present a novel approach in which we define neurobiologically distinct subgroups ? based on the most feasible, most robust, and most likely to relate to treatment outcomes ? in these Veterans with combat related psychiatric distress. We have selected a set of brain imaging, molecular biology, and physiological markers such that measures will not be influenced by current clinical models. We will then seek to determine robust subgroups from this model-based hierarchical clustering approach. Next, we contrast our neurobiologically defined groups with traditional groups or general response. Finally, to help best understand the available data and feed forward for future studies, we will run a supervised machine learning (random forest) to determine the optimal variables and groups to predict treatment response. We have opted to solely test sertraline, as this is the most commonly prescribed medication in this population at the San Diego VA mental health clinics (FDA approved for MDD and PTSD). The model-based clustering approach allows us to look at the non-linear relationship between variables of interest and foster an attempt to better link clinical research and clinical practice to best benefit our Veteran population."
"9355046","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):           The primary aim of this 6-site prospective cohort study is to develop algorithms usable in the clinical setting that predict decompressive laminectomy (DL) outcomes (i.e., success vs. failure) in older adults with lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS), the most common indication for spine surgery in older patients. The clinical algorithms developed will be based primarily on factors outside of LSS that are important aging-related predictors of pain and disability (e.g., hip osteoarthritis [OA], fibromyalgia syndrome, depression, anxiety, fear-avoidance beliefs, dysfunctional coping). Preliminary data support the impact of some of these factors on DL outcomes, but no study has included comprehensive assessment of rigorously collected data in the context of a prospective cohort. Thus LSS treatment remains focused exclusively on the lumbar spine and treatment outcomes suboptimal with, on average, < 20% reduction in pain. An estimated one in three DL patients does not improve at all. Further, anatomical evidence of LSS (i.e., based on advanced imaging) exists in many older patients without pain or functional compromise. Two hundred fifty patients with symptomatic LSS scheduled to undergo DL without fusion and who have no dementia, spinal instability, or prior lumbar surgery will be recruited from spine surgery practice at each of the 6 participating sites (VA Pittsburgh Healthcare System, Durham VA Medical Center [MC], Richmond VAMC, Ann Arbor VAMC, Denver VAMC, San Antonio VAMC). Within 30 days prior to DL (i.e., at baseline), participants will undergo comprehensive and rigorous assessment of pain and disability-generating factors including: 1) SS symptoms with the Brigham Spinal Stenosis questionnaire (BSS, the most specific available LSS measurement tool); 2) musculoskeletal comorbidities (scoliosis, kyphosis, hip osteoarthritis, fibromyalgia symptoms, severity of spinal stenosis, degenerative disc and facet disease); 3) mood (depression [with the CES-D], anxiety [with the GAD-7]); 4) cognitive function (normal vs. mild cognitive impairment with the computer-based assessment of mild cognitive impairment); 5) psychological function (fear-avoidance beliefs [with the Fear Avoidance Beliefs Questionnaire], chronic pain self-efficacy [with the Chronic Pain Self-Efficacy Scales], dysfunctional pain coping skills [with the Cognitive Strategies Questionnaire], treatment expectancy, illicit substance use, alcohol use, smoking status, PTSD symptoms); 6) medical comorbidity (including BMI); 7) demographic factors (age, gender, race, educational/marital status). The BSS will be collected at baseline, at the first postoperative visit, and every 3 months for one year. Prediction rules, based on the comprehensive set of factors measured and DL success/failure determined by the BSS, will be created using multiple methods to maximize predictive accuracy and validated subsequently in a separate cohort of 100 individuals. We will apply these rules to future comparative effectiveness trials that test personalized LSS treatment approaches (i.e., that involve targeting extra-LSS factors as part of the total treatment package) as compared with DL alone. An exploratory aim of the proposed study is to evaluate the use of Goal Attainment Scaling (GAS) as a DL outcome. This patient-centered outcomes measurement approach is used commonly in the rehabilitation setting, but never before in DL patients. To prepare for future comparative effectiveness trials, we want to develop GAS as an outcome measure because it can be used to track outcomes in SS patients across surgical and non-surgical interventions, and we anticipate that both will be employed as part of personalized treatment. We will explore (through 10-12 patient interviews) and refine (with a modified Delphi panel of experts) GAS goals in patients with SS, and measure goal achievement in a subset of 20 participants. What might happen if older adults with LSS were treated in the context of a comprehensive pre-operative program before undergoing DL? Might long-term outcomes associated with DL improve? Might patient satisfaction improve? Might some patients avoid DL? These are questions that ultimately we hope to answer."
"9351392","Project Summary Excessive alcohol use (EAU) is becoming recognized as an emerging health-related problem especially among veterans returning from combats. There is a need for increased vigilance and action to identify and counsel these at-risk veterans. Unfortunately, we lack the reliable diagnostic tests to detect the dangerous levels of drinking. Such tests would be indispensable for screening and care for veterans with excessive alcohol use. We hypothesize that several novel serum and urine markers based on the effect of alcohol on immune cells can be used as the predictive biomarkers for EAU. To test this hypothesis, we plan to pursue the following specific aims. SPECIFIC AIM # 1. To determine the effect of EAU on organ systems using system biology and by detecting, identifying, and comparing the relative quantity of these novel targets and evaluate these as potential biomarkers and SPECIFIC AIM # 2. To determine the predictive capacity of these biomarkers for alcohol-related health consequences. If successful, the results from this project will revolutionize the screening methods for veterans with excessive alcohol use."
"9378734","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):          Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is debilitating and common (up to 30% in Vietnam Veterans and 16% in Afghanistan and Iraq Veterans). A significant number of Veterans do not engage in or drop-out from effective trauma-focused therapies due to avoidance from trauma-related memories. Because of this limitation, and because scientific literature suggested that acupuncture might be effective for PTSD symptoms, we developed an acupuncture intervention for PTSD and conducted a clinical trial that showed positive effects. This remains the only high quality trial of acupuncture for PSTD published, because of which the current VA/DoD guidelines for PTSD state that acupuncture is a B recommendation (fair evidence, provide service) for PTSD treatment. That civilian study compared acupuncture to an effective therapy (CBT) and a wait-list control, but did not have a placebo control. And, research has shown that Veterans may respond differently to therapies than civilians. More definitive data about the efficacy of acupuncture for PTSD is required in order to recommend it as an A evidence-based intervention for PTSD in Veterans. Specifically, it is important to show that acupuncture is better  than a placebo control and that it has effects on biological abnormalities of PTSD. The aim of this study is to demonstrate efficacy of acupuncture for PTSD by showing clinical and biological effects that are statistically larger and clinically more important than effects of sham acupuncture. Given current knowledge and the need for efficient, ethical and best practices within an experimental design, the primary aim is best accomplished by a randomized controlled trial comparing verum acupuncture (ACU) to placebo minimal needling sham acupuncture (MIN). The goal is to evaluate ACU for a significant positive signal, not to compare ACU to other interventions or to evaluate treatment durability. Acupuncture is delivered in 24 sessions over 12 weeks. The primary hypothesis is that efficacy of ACU for PTSD symptom severity will be large (pre- to post- treatment Cohen's d > 0.8), and significantly better than MIN (between group Cohen's d > 0.30, with 80% probability of detecting a true group difference at p<0.05 (2-sided). The secondary hypothesis is that compared to MIN, ACU will be associated with a significantly larger change from pre- to post-treatment in psychophysiological response (decreased startle by EMG eye blink during fear conditioning procedure). The study design is a two-arm, parallel-group, prospective RCT. The sample frame is Veterans with chronic PTSD with a sample of convenience from those seeking care at the Long Beach VA. Exclusion criteria are meant to keep out individuals with characteristics that are known to be PTSD treatment confounds, associated with non- adherence or negative response to treatment, that may significantly affect biological assessment, or who may be put at risk of harm. The sample size (90) provides adequate power to test hypotheses. Subjects will be allocated to intervention group by computer-generated adaptive randomization. General linear mixed models will be used to evaluate hypothesized effects over time (mid treatment, end of treatment, 1-month follow-up), controlling for baseline severity of symptoms and demographic characteristics (e.g., age, gender) using intent-to-treat modeling. Outcome effect size (Cohen's d) within and between subjects will be calculated. Interaction terms will be included in the models to evaluate treatment  fidelity and treatment expectancy as potential moderators. Study results will provide clinicians and policy makers with more information to make decisions about the rational use of acupuncture for PTSD. This is important because acupuncture is being touted for PTSD by many advocates. It has the potential to reach PTSD sufferers who are not willing to engage in trauma-focused psychotherapy, or for whom current therapies are ineffective. The objective of this project is consistent with priority research areas of specific interest to CSR&D including PTSD and complementary medicine, and all participants are Veterans at a VA Hospital."
"9448721","Background / Rationale: Venous thrombus embolism (VTE), which includes deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and its complications are a significant source of morbidity and mortality among Americans; and have increased in the Veteran population over the last decade. A recent study of almost 500,000 surgeries performed at the Department of Veterans Affair Medical Centers found that over half of the patients developed VTE within 90 days after surgery. Along with the potentially fatal complication of pulmonary embolism, DVT frequently leads to a significant long-term complication for which we have no specific therapy, post-thrombotic syndrome; which causes debilitating swelling, pain, and leg ulceration in 25-60% of DVT patients. Common risk factors for DVT include: cancer, major trauma, surgery, paralysis, prolonged periods of immobility, and older age. Deployed military personnel are at an increased risk due to prolonged air and ground transport, dehydration, tobacco use, and extended immobility during hospitalizations for severe injuries. Current therapies rely on anticoagulants to treat DVT, which do not resolve existing blood clots; but only prevent further clot development. Thrombus resolution is a critical factor in the pathogenesis of post-thrombotic syndrome since incomplete thrombus resolution can result in obstruction of flow and loss of venous valve function. Clinical studies show that patients with more rapid thrombus resolution have a better prognosis than those patients whose thrombus resolves much slower. At present, the cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in DVT are poorly understood, and there currently is no therapy to accelerate this process. Objectives: Using clinically relevant experimental models of DVT, we have uncovered a critical molecular pathway that functions as a key modulator of inflammation during venous thrombus resolution. A comprehensive picture of interconnected cell-mediated molecular processes that orchestrate a precise inflammatory program is starting to emerge. Our research plan proposes to define this pathway by (1) determining mechanisms by which plasminogen activator inhibitor type 2 (PAI-2) deficiency modulates early acute DVT to accelerate venous thrombus resolution, and (2) determining the role of plasmin-generated fibrin degradation products (FDPs) in regulating inflammatory macrophages during venous thrombus resolution. Methods: Studies will utilize genetically deficient mice in experimental models of DVT that accurately mimic many of the clinical and pathophysiological features observed in human DVT. Venous thrombi will be analyzed by immunohistochemistry, flow cytometry, mRNA and protein analyses for molecular indicators of inflammation and thrombus resolution. Proteolytic pathways will be investigated using ex vivo thrombolysis assays, cellular clot lysis assays, and ex vivo cell culture. Morphometric analyses and biomechanical assays will assess vein wall injury. The translational potential of these findings will be tested in human cells and in preclinical models. Findings/Results: Novel molecular mechanisms that modulate inflammation during venous thrombus resolution will be identified and the potential for therapies based on these mechanisms tested in preclinical models. Status: This is a new project arising from substantial supportive preliminary data from a previous VA Merit Award. Impact: The knowledge gained from these studies has strong potential for clinical translation since specific antagonism of inhibitors of venous thrombus resolution or resolution-promoting agonists could present safe and effective therapies for accelerating this process, in combination with anticoagulants, provide an improved treatment for reducing venous pulmonary embolism and post-thrombotic complications from DVT in our Veteran population."
"9145865","RESEARCH PROJECT 1: PROJECT SUMMARY  Dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis has been suggested as a mechanism through which  social and biological factors contribute to racial disparities in cancer outcomes. A prolonged and elevated  glucocorticoid (GC) response following a social stressor predicts tumor growth rates and the development of  rodent cancers that histologically and etiologically resembles human disease. The GC response is a key  biomarker for allostatic load, which is a measure of biological responses to stressors. Many African Americans  experience stressful life events and circumstances, including economic, discriminatory, and other stressors.  These psychosocial factors may contribute to the well-documented poorer outcomes experienced by African  American men with prostate cancer. However stress reactivity (SR), or one's physiological and psychological  responses to a stressor, is highly individualized and dependent on psychological and social determinants as  well as genetic factors. Investigators at MUSC will investigate the role of SR in the development of immune  responses to prostate cancer among subjects participating in a prostate vaccine trial. The trial itself will be  conducted to document the effects of a poxvirus vaccine (PROSTVAC) on the cancer growth and immune  responses of patients immediately after radical prostatectomy. MUSC investigators will be able to study these  subjects to determine the levels of stress and stressors and the feasibility of using validated psychologic  methods to characterize these parameters in older men. The specific aims of this study are to: (1) conduct a  Phase II clinical trial of PROSTVAC vaccine in subjects at high risk of relapse after radical prostatectomy for  prostate cancer as a platform to evaluate the effects of SR on the development of an effective anti-tumor  immune response; (2) measure stress reactivity among prostate cancer patients at risk for relapse based on  socioeconomic status, glucocorticoid receptor (GR) polymorphisms, perceptions of social stressors, and  allostatic load; and (3) compare the magnitude and distribution of stress responses with clinical and  immunologic measures of vaccine effect. This clinical trial will provide a ?real world? setting of immunotherapy  and immune response development in prostate cancer patients as they are experiencing an acute cancer-  related stressor (e.g., risk for recurrence). In addition, this research will provide novel empirical data on the  frequency and kinds of stress in prostate cancer survivors, their physiological responses to a validated  laboratory stressor, and the associations between SR and clinical, genomic, and immunologic parameters  important in immunotherapy."
"9470693","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Millions of patients suffer from delayed wound healing stem from systemic diseases or external traumas, which can result in a loss of skin integrity, disability, and even death. An important aspect of healing is re- epithelialization that entails both proliferation and migration of keratinocytes at the periphery of the wound. When re-epithelialization is not achieved in a timely fashion, patients suffer from delayed wound healing. Understanding the role and function of keratinocytes in re-epithelialization will be of benefit to these patients. Oral wounds exhibit accelerated re-epithelialization when compared to equivalently sized skin wounds. Our laboratory recently identified a previously unnoticed landscape of non-coding RNA in saliva. Of particularly interests are three distinctive oral-piwi-interacting RNAs (oral-piRNAs) that are uniquely present in saliva and oral keratinocytes and appear to contribute to the oral wound re-epitheliazation phenotype. The applicant performed studies including in vitro scratch assays that demonstrated a continual increase of oral-piRNA expressions post wounding in human oral keratinocyte and not in skin keratinocytes. Furthermore, independent knockdown of these oral- piRNAs in the human oral wound scratch assay resulted in the significant delay and failure of oral wound closure. The overarching hypothesis of this proposal is that oral-piRNAs are intrinsic factors in human oral keratinocytes modulating the rapidity of wound closure. Based on the preliminary data, the applicant aims to validate the role of oral-piRNAs in oral wound healing in a 3D ex-vivo oral mucosal wound healing model in Aim 1 and then follow by elucidating the cellular and genetic factors responsible for the oral-piRNA mediated oral wound healing phenotypes, including epithelial migration and proliferation in Aim 2. By understanding oral-piRNA roles in normal oral wound healing, we can identify differences in skin wound healing regulation and alterations in delayed healing wounds. As we unravel how oral-piRNAs modulate human oral keratinocyte proliferation and migration, we may improve wound healing therapeutic developments. The long-term goals of this proposal are to advance the biological understanding and functions of piRNA relevant to human oral health and diseases and use the findings to benefit wound healing in patients. This F30 fellowship will prepare the trainee for an academic career to become an independent researcher in oral wound healing and piwi-interacting RNA biology."

We will conduct a three stage placebo controlled PK/PD study in adult male Rhesus  macaques with the GRFT rectal gel formulation and matched placebo gel supplied by Core B. The  proposed macaque study is designed to address specific translational questions concerning  immunotoxicity and health of the mucosal environment after GRFT exposure. Favorable stage 1  outcomes include detection of active HIV-1 inhibitory concentrations of GRFT in rectal fluids and  acceptable clinical safety metrics, which allows progression to the efficacy Stage 2. Using a cohort  of GRFT treatment experienced animals will allow us to determine whether pre-existing immunity to  GRFT affects product efficacy. Stage 3 will test the GRFT and placebo products in SHIV infected  animals, where we will compare amounts of virus shed in experimental versus control animals,  providing an additional safety metric. Aim 2 is to assess the impact of GRFT treatment on the  mucosal immune environment. We will use multiplexed immunoassays and gene expression arrays  to measure markers of inflammatory immune responses. The highly sensitive  immunohistochemistry (IHC) techniques refined in Prof. Kristina Broliden's laboratory will be applied  to compare the number, distribution and activation state of HIV target cells and expression of HIV  receptor targets CD4, CCR5, DC-SIGN and Langerin plus markers of epithelial integrity in rectal  biopsies from animals treated with GRFT active drug or matched placebo. Flow cytometry analyses  will also enumerate and phenotype lymphocytes in biopsy tissues. Aim 3 is to assess the impact of  GRFT treatment on the mucosal environment in the rectum using a systems biology approach that  utilizes modern mass spectrometry proteomics assays to compare tissues and rectal secretions  from animals that receive active drug versus placebo, and to evaluate the effect of GRFT treatment  on the rectal microbiota of treated animals."
"9351822","Abstract  The ?brain in a dish? is an ideal in vitro system to model human neuronal behaviors in health and disease. In this study, we aim to establish benchmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD) neuropathology formation in three dimensional (3D) neuronal cultures derived from AD subjects. Evolving cellular models for AD include a 3D human neuronal culture system which depends on overexpression of two AD genes to replicate AD neuropathology. We have recently advanced this model by creating a 3D neuronal culture using induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) derived from AD patients. This novel model is the first to use AD iPSC-derived 3D neurons that do not overexpress exogenous genes. When fully characterized, this model will substantially advance AD research and drug development. In this study, we propose to characterize the generation of tau- containing neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) and amyloid ? protein (A?)-containing neuritic plaques, the two pathological hallmarks of AD, and test the dependence of this pathology on a select group of upstream facilitators using standard techniques for selective knockdown. In preliminary studies, we have found increased levels of tau and neurofilament light polypeptide (NfL) in AD neurons, consistent with published analyses of blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of AD patients. We have also characterized post-mortem brain tissue and identified a tau binding protein S100B that was significantly increased in brain tissue from AD patients. Our aims reflect our hypotheses that 1) AD patients' iPSC-derived 3D neuro-spheroids recapitulate the molecular neuropathology of AD brains, and 2) the molecular neuropathology is responsive to manipulation of established and experimental upstream factors. First, we will aim to detect A? and tau pathology in iPSC- derived 3D human neurons and compare their properties to those in postmortem brain samples. We will characterize biochemical properties of A? aggregates and quantify A? peptides, and we will also characterize/compare ptau profiles. We will determine whether 3D neuro-spheroids from AD subjects have more A? and ptau than those from control subjects. We will also calculate ratios of A?42/A?40 and ptau/tau and determine whether higher ratios are found in 3D neuro-spheroids from AD patients. We will determine whether A?/tau pathologies are present in iPSC-derived 3D neuro-spheroids. Second, we will aim to validate proteins facilitating pathogenesis in 3D neuro-spheroids by chemical inhibition and genetic knock-down. We will determine if blocking BACE1 and S100B reduces A?/tau pathology formation in iPSC-derived 3D neuro- spheroids. We will also determine if reduction of NfL in 3D neuro-spheroids deters A?/tau pathology formation. These studies will validate this in vitro model and establish standards for future utilization. Future studies will target these facilitators for therapeutic intervention."
"9393862","Project Summary A growing body of literature implicates the brain in the control of glucose homeostasis, yet very little is known with respect to the mechanisms whereby this control occurs. The goal of the proposed work is to identify and characterize the neurocircuits linking key brain regions involved in glycemic control and to determine how they mediate their effects. Recent work from the applicant?s lab demonstrates that photo-activation of hypothalamic ventromedial nucleus (i.e. VMNSF1) neurons is both necessary and sufficient for glucose counterregulation, suggesting that these neurons play a physiological role in glycemic control. Moreover, a subset of VMNSF1 neurons that project to the anterior bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (aBNST) are implicated in this glucoregulatory circuit. In addition, our preliminary data demonstrates that photo-activation of a subset of VMN neurons expressing nitric oxide synthase-1 (NOS1) mimics the effect of VMNSF1 to acutely raise blood glucose, and that this appears to involve projections to the aBNST. In Specific Aim 1, we propose to determine if activation of VMNNOS1 neurons is required for intact counter-regulatory responses to hypoglycemia. In Specific Aim 2, we propose to identify and characterize the subset of aBNST neurons involved in glucose counterregulation that lies downstream of VMN neurons. To accomplish these objectives, we will employ optogenetics and DREADD technologies in combination with viral, mouse genetics, and immunohistochemical techniques. Overall, this work has the potential to fundamentally advance our understanding of neurocircuits that regulate glucose metabolism and determine whether dysregulation of these circuits contributes to the pathogenesis of diabetes."
"9351866","The objective of this application is to determine the burden of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) among patients receiving primary care at the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) health care system. NAFLD affects an estimated 20%-30% of the adult non-VA US population and is projected to become the main cause of end- stage liver disease in the next 10 years. NAFLD encompasses a histologic spectrum ranging from simple steatosis to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Around 20% of patients with NASH undergo fibrotic progression to cirrhosis, which increases risk of liver failure the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma. NAFLD is considered the hepatic complication of obesity and insulin resistance. Proper diagnosis of NAFLD and subsequent treatment (e.g., dietitian services) is associated with improved biochemical and histological features of NAFLD. There are also ongoing clinical trials with promising medications (e.g., obeticholic acid) for NASH. Given the veteran population is disproportionately affected by the main risk factors for NAFLD (e.g., diabetes, obesity), our central hypothesis is that the veteran population in primary care is particularly susceptible to a high burden from NAFLD. It is unclear whether the VA is currently equipped to deal with this costly disorder given the lack of basic information on the prevalence, determinants, and clinical recognition of NAFLD in the VA. Advances in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has revolutionized the diagnosis and severity staging of NAFLD, thus obviating the need for liver biopsy in most cases. However, the use of MRI for NAFLD screening in a primary care setting is impractical and expensive. There are no agreed upon clinical prediction rules, and none that is tested in VA settings. We will address our hypothesis by conducting a probability-based cross-sectional study of 1000 veterans (500 males and 500 females) enrolled in the VA for their primary healthcare. Specific Aim #1: To determine the overall and race- and sex- specific prevalence of NAFLD (and Advanced Hepatic Fibrosis) using highly sensitive and specific MRI criteria in a large and representative sample of veterans enrolled at the Michael E. DeBakey VA Medical Center in Houston for their primary healthcare. This aim will be accomplished by combined use of liver magnetic resonance imaging proton density fat fraction (MRI-PDFF) and elastography (MRE). Specific Aim #2: To evaluate the association between presence and severity of NAFLD and potential risk factors, including demographic (gender, race/ethnicity), anthropometric (BMI, waist circumference, and body fat by bioimpedance analysis), clinical (medical history, family history, and medications), serologic (CD18), genetic (PNPLA3), biochemical (LFTs, serologic biomarkers of hepatic fibrosis and steatosis), metabolic (serologic markers of metabolic syndrome), and lifestyle (smoking, alcohol, exercise) factors. Specific Aim #3: Use the information on risk factors and biomarkers to construct and validate an algorithm that can be used at the primary care level to identify patients at high risk of NAFLD and NASH for further referral. The information on prevalence in different groups are essential for effective VA healthcare planning and resource allocation. The study will aid in the clinical recognition of NAFLD in the VA primary care setting using VA specific risk factors. Finally, our study will provide data needed to support future research to develop clinical pathways for detection and referral."
"9350821","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Management of liver failure after resection or drug injury and prevention and treatment of liver tumors is a major medical challenge to the VA population. Understanding mechanisms of liver regeneration will provide a profound strategy to meet this challenge. Liver regeneration is a well-orchestrated process. Portal circulation and gut-derived factors are critical to liver functions. However, the nature of the factor(s) present in portal blood to promote liver regeneration is unclear and identifying these factors will provide novel strategies to treat liver diseases. An endocrine fibroblast growth factor, FGF15 /19 (15 in mice and 19 in humans), is critical in regulating liver functions as it is known to suppress bile acid synthesis by activating its receptor on hepatocytes, fibroblast growth factor receptor 4 (FGFR4). FGF15/19 is mainly produced in the ileum following activation of the farnesoid X receptor (FXR). Recently, studies from our and other groups have shown that FGF15/19 emerges to be gut-derived mitogens for hepatocyte proliferation due to its suppressive effect on bile acid synthesis and by direct stimulation of cell proliferation. The purpose of the current application is to determine the underlying molecular mechanism by which the intestine-derived FGF15/19 directly promotes cell proliferation and liver regeneration. Our compelling published and preliminary data suggest that FGF15 is important in liver regeneration. We have formulated a novel hypothesis that a major mechanisms by which FGF15 promotes liver regeneration is by direct activation of critical early signaling pathways (MAPK, STAT3 and NF?B) in cell proliferation (Fig 1). This hypothesis will be tested in three independent but related specific aims: Specific Aim 1: fully characterize the cell proliferative effects of FGF15/19 in vitro and in vivo. Specific Aim 2: Determine the molecular mechanism by which FGF15 regulates hepatocyte proliferation and liver regeneration. Specific Aim 3: determine the functional domains/sequences of FGF15/19 protein in promoting cell proliferation and in suppressing bile acid synthesis. The working hypothesis is that certain amino acid sequence within the FGF15 and FGF19 protein is responsible for differential effects (cell proliferation vs. suppression of bile acid synthesis). We will determine the FGF15 protein sequence or domains critical in promoting cell proliferation versus suppression of bile acid synthesis, with a direct comparison of FGF19. This aim will provide scientific insight to modify FGF19 in differential treatment of liver diseases in the future. This project is innovative both conceptually and in the implementation of experimental approaches by establishing a gut regulatory pathway mediated by FGF15/19 in hepatocyte proliferation and liver regeneration. This will improve the management of liver failure after surgical resection, chemical exposure or behavioral disruptions, as well as in the prevention and treatment of liver tumor. "
"9469006","Project Summary Metabolic disorders have become an increasing burden for health worldwide as reflected by the unprecedented incidence of obesity and diabetes. The impact of these disorders on human health has refocused biomedical research on understanding the regulation of metabolism with a goal of developing new strategies for effective therapy. One of these efforts centers on nuclear receptors (NRs), which are a large family of ligand-regulated transcription factors that play central roles in development, growth and metabolism. In the Thummel laboratory, we utilize the model system Drosophila to discover evolutionarily-conserved aspects of NR regulation and function. My studies focus on the Estrogen-Related Receptors (ERRs) in maintaining metabolic homeostasis. Three paralogs make up the ERR family in mice and humans: ERR?, ERR?, and ERR?. Studies of these receptors have demonstrated their importance in regulating oxidative phosphorylation and mitochondrial function in energy-rich tissues. Our understanding of ERR functions, however, has been complicated by their overlapping expression patterns, genetic redundancy, and compensatory activities. Additionally, ERR? is necessary for lipid homeostasis in mammals; however, neither the tissue-specific nor mechanistic basis of this phenotype is well understood. In Drosophila, the ERR family is represented by a single ortholog, dERR, allowing us to study ERR functions in the absence of genetic redundancy. My project is focused on defining roles for dERR during the adult stage of life, when the animal maintains homeostasis in the context of energy expenditure to support the demands of motility and reproduction. My preliminary studies have shown that loss of dERR function in adults results in reduced fertility, decreased glycogen, and an almost complete lack of stored triglycerides. Transcriptional profiling by RNA-seq revealed that a number of genes involved in lipid metabolism are expressed at reduced levels in dERR mutants. My results support the hypothesis that dERR maintains lipid levels in adults through its roles in regulating lipid synthesis and lipid transport. I will test this hypothesis through two specific aims: (1) to characterize the tissue-specific functions of dERR and (2) to test the hypothesis that dERR maintains lipid synthesis and transport. Taken together, these studies exploit the rapid and powerful genetics of Drosophila to define the ancestral role of ERR in the absence of functional redundancy, provide new insights into how the mammalian receptors have diversified to exert their roles in metabolism, and establish a basis for understanding how misregulation of ERR-regulated pathways can contribute to metabolic disorders and human disease."
"9378102","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Osteoarthritis (OA), the most common form of arthritis, is a prevalent and debilitating disease without therapies that alter disease progress and is currently managed with symptom-modifying therapies that are only modestly effective. We propose a randomized, sham-controlled clinical trial of pulsed low-intensity ultrasound (PLIUS) as a novel yet well-justified treatment that could fundamentally alter OA management.  OA affects almost 27 million Americans with an estimated annual cost of over $80 billion. The prevalence of OA is increasing rapidly. Estimates suggest that about 60 million Americans will be affected by 2030. Still greater prevalence is seen in members of the armed services, making it a disease of special importance to the Department of Veterans Affairs. OA is the leading cause of lower extremity pain and disability in older age and is the leading indication for total knee replacement (TKR), with the number of TKR procedures having more than doubled over the last decade. The increasing burden of OA is largely because available medical management addresses only pain with long-term efficacy that is marginal at best. In spite of substantial progress in understanding the pathogenesis of OA, no effective disease modifying interventions have been established.  Degenerative articular cartilage is central to the pathogenesis of OA, however, articular cartilage has limited capacity for repair. Thus, the development of OA therapeutics that focus on cartilage regeneration and repair strategies are of great importance. A large body of pre-clinical work has demonstrated the anabolic effect of mechanical stimulation on chondrocyte metabolism. Published literature from pre-clinical and clinical bone fracture and pre-clinical cartilage research indicate that effective mechanical stimulation can be delivered via PLIUS. These consistently positive data affirm the need to investigate the potential of PLIUS as an important intervention for treatment of OA.  We propose a Phase IIa, multi-center, randomized, sham-controlled, parallel, double-blind trial with a prerandomization sham run-in period to determine if PLIUS is potentially more effective than sham as a symptom- and structure-modifying intervention in patients with early OA of the knee. PLIUS will be applied using an FDA-approved device already in clinical use for bone fracture healing. The study consists of three periods: a 28-day Screening Period, a four week Prerandomization Sham Run-in Period and a 48-Week Sham-controlled Treatment Period. The three recruiting centers, the Salt Lake City, Pittsburgh, and San Diego Veterans Affairs Medical Centers, have extensive experience in successfully conducting OA trials. Over a 23-month recruitment period, 178 patients with clinical and relatively early stage radiographic knee OA meeting entry criteria will be enrolled into the pre-randomization sham run- in period. A total of 160 patients who successfully completed the run-in period and continue to meet entry criteria will be randomized into the sham-controlled treatment period. All patients will be followed in the treatment period for 48 weeks, which is the time point for assessment of the co-primary outcomes of symptom relief, as assessed by the OMERACT-OARSI Responder Criteria, and structural modification, as assessed by MRI-determined medial femoral condyle cartilage thickness. Emerging data from the Osteoarthritis Initiative (OAI) suggests that this is a sensitive and specific measure for structural progression of OA. Innovative and exploratory disease markers, including subchondral bone marrow lesions and soluble serum and urine biomarkers for OA will also be evaluated, along with more traditional outcomes such as the WOMAC OA Index and radiographic joint space narrowing.  The pre-clinical data supporting this study are described in the Research Plan. This project is a translational bench-to-bedside proposal targeting a highly debilitating, prevalent, and costly disease for which current treatment options are exceedingly limited. We have assembled an outstanding collaborative team of clinical scientists in leading OA centers within the Department of Veterans Affairs. If this intervention is successful and subsequently confirmed as an effective treatment for OA in a pivotal trial, it could fundamentally change the standard of care for this highly prevalent and debilitating disease, potentially improving the quality of life for tens of millions of veterans and other Americans."
"9336729","Background: Obesity is a major risk factor for mobility limitation in older adults. It is estimated that 11 million older adults have mobility disability and > 4 million older adults use walking assistive devices. Mobility disability results in decreased economy of gait, physical deconditioning and reduced peak aerobic capacity (VO2peak). Impaired economy of gait and decreased physiological reserve may lead to increased fatigue, reduced endurance, and ultimately contribute to reduced functional independence. The optimal intervention to improve mobility limitations in older, obese adults is not known, particular in those who use walking assistive devices, and there is limited information on whether improvements in physical function can be sustained over time. Preliminary studies demonstrate that our novel progressive group multimodal balance intervention (MMBI), focusing on lateral movements, lower extremity strengthening and dynamic obstacle negotiation can improve gait, balance, and strength in mobility limited older adults. However, it is no known if weight loss in combination with MMBI will provide additive or synergistic improvements in mobility limited older, obese Veterans. We hypothesize that our MMBI program in combination with a hypocaloric nutritional intervention (Nutrition) will be more effective than MMBI alone in improving muscle quality, physical function and economy of gait. In addition, we hypothesize that the Nutrition + MMBI will be more effective than MMBI alone at improving self- reported measures of function and disability. Objective: We propose a randomized clinical trial in 120 older (age > 60 yr) community-dwelling obese (BMI >30 kg/m2), Veterans with mobility limitations who use walking assistive devices in which we will: Specific aim 1: Compare the effects of a 6-month MMBI intervention alone to a 6-month combination Nutrition + MMBI on physical functioning and economy of gait. Specific aim 2: Compare the effects of the two interventions on body composition, muscle mass, strength and relative sarcopenia. Specific aim 3: Assess the effects of the two interventions at baseline, 6, 12 and 24 months on their self- reported measures of function and disability using the Late-Life Function and Disability Instrument (LLFDI). Methods: Veterans enrolled into the study will have baseline testing at the Baltimore GRECC and VAMHCS Human Performance Laboratory consisting of 1) performance-based outcome measures include VO2peak, gait speed (gait rite), chair stands, lateral mobility and balance (four square step test, figure eight), SPPB, handgrip strength (dynamometry), and economy of gait (portable VO2 measurement during 6 minute walk) and functional status (ADL, IADLs); 2) lower extremity strength testing, 3) total body DXA scan, and a CT scan of the abdomen, hips and thighs for determination of lower extremity and core muscle composition; and 4) biomarkers. After completion of baseline testing, the Veterans will be randomized to one of the two interventions. Nutrition classes will be led by a GRECC dietitian. The goal is for subjects to lose 10% of their weight over the first 6 months with gradual weight loss after that. The MMBI will consist of a group dynamic balance class, a supervised obstacle course, and lower extremity and core strengthening. After 3-, 6-, 12-, and 24-months, subjects will repeat the assessments that they had at baseline. Impact: Few exercise rehabilitation studies target older, obese Veterans who use walking assistive device and indeed individuals who use walking assistive devices are often excluded from the studies. This research directly benefits Veterans as it may lead to more effective interventions that improve mobility, reduce fall risk, and reduce injury-related hospitalization and death in older Veterans with mobility limitations. This nutritional and multimodal balance intervention is readily exportable to the community and with additional resources could be widely implemented at other VAs as part of clinical care."
"9561809","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Periodontitis affects 64 million US adults, leading to bone and tooth loss and contributing to systemic conditions. Subgingival bacteria play a major role in periodontitis. Because 50% of the oral microbiome is unrecognized or uncultured, important species may have been overlooked, representing a gap in knowledge.  The progress in cultivating relevant oral uncultured taxa has been slow. The few studies available are either low-throughput or open-ended, which are less suitable to cultivate putative pathogens. Because our goal is to improve periodontal health, we aim at cultivating taxa that are relevant in disease, and not just any uncultured taxa. Results from my R03 showed that many unrecognized/uncultured subgingival taxa were uncommon, thus unlikely to be relevant. In contrast, I identified 30 abundant uncultured taxa that merit further pursuit and will be the focus of this proposal. Our long term goal is to identify new periodontal pathogens and their pathogenic mechanisms. The overall objective of this proposal is to recover and domesticate uncultured taxa associated with periodontal disease. Our central hypothesis is that their growth results from interactions with community members and the habitat, which have not yet been reproduced in vitro. Our rationale is that targeted systematic cultivation of relevant taxa in ex vivo biofilms is a cost-effective approach to isolate new periodontal pathogens. We will use technological and conceptual innovative approaches to achieve our goals.  We will test this hypothesis and accomplish our objective by pursuing the following Specific Aims: 1) Support the growth of prominent uncultured taxa in ex vivo periodontal biofilms: we will use the Calgary Biofilm Device to multiplex the cultivation conditions (using multiple growth conditions in paralle) of subgingival samples pre-screened for the target taxa using 16S rRNA lllumina sequencing; 2) Identify helper species that can sustain the growth of target uncultured periodontal taxa: we will use CLASI-FISH (a multiplex FISH) on the biofilms and correlation network analysis of 16S rRNA data to identify in situ and in silico the best helper species based on their co-occurrence and physical proximity with target uncultured taxa; and 3) Domesticate uncultured periodontal taxa in a small consortium of helper species: we will use the best growth conditions and helpers species identified above for the high-throughput parallel co-cultivation of uncultured taxa.  This proposal is significant because it will allow the cultivation of novel putative periodontal pathogens, a key step to determine their pathogenicity. Our contribution to the field will be the identification of ecological relationships that allow their growth, the generation of whole genomic sequences as well as the development of a systematic approach that can be useful to study other biofilm diseases. The outcomes of our study will support NIDCR's research initiatives for FY2014 (the role of uncultivable bacteria in the oral microbiome) and their mission to foster the knowledge of the etiology and pathogenesis of oral infectious diseases."
"9350900","Patients with heart failure (HF) account for over 1,200,000 VA outpatient visits per year, and HF remains the most common cause for hospital admission in the VA. Approximately 1/3 of veterans with HF have `preserved' ejection fraction (HFpEF), or relatively normal contractile function of the heart; such patients suffer functional decline and poor quality of life, and half die within 5 years after diagnosis. Risk factors for developing HFpEF are more common in veterans than the general population, and the burden of HFpEF to the VA system will rise in the years ahead as these veterans age. Preventive efforts are critical, but are hampered by gaps in knowledge related to HFpEF pathophysiology. The long term goal of this proposal is to prevent the onset of HFpEF in at-risk veterans. Hypertension (HTN) confers the highest population-attributable risk for HFpEF, particularly when accompanied by the metabolic syndrome, a constellation of obesity, insulin resistance, and dyslipidemia. Animal models of HTN and metabolic syndrome develop HFpEF due to microvascular oxidative stress and inflammation induced by high sodium intake. Recent data from cardiac biopsies confirm similar mechanisms in human HFpEF. Dietary sodium restriction is widely recommended to prevent HTN-associated heart disease in humans, but this advice is now controversial. Few studies have examined how individual differences in response to sodium intake affect risk. ?Salt-sensitive? persons have blood pressure (BP) that changes in parallel with sodium intake, and commonly develop cardiovascular abnormalities associated with HFpEF. The overall objective of this proposal is to evaluate salt-sensitivity as a novel, diet-responsive risk factor for incident HFpEF in veterans with HTN and metabolic syndrome. The central hypothesis is that the sodium-restricted Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH/SRD) eating pattern will improve cardiovascular functional and structural risk factors for HFpEF in veterans with the salt-sensitive phenotype. Guided by findings in experimental models, cohort studies, and strong preliminary evidence from our research group, this hypothesis will be tested in a two-phase study and by pursuing three specific aims: 1) Determine effects of DASH/SRD on functional and structural cardiovascular HFpEF risk factors in salt-sensitive vs. salt- resistant veterans, 2) measure the effect of an electronically-delivered tailored-messaging intervention on DASH/SRD adherence, and 3) determine effects of DASH/SRD intervention and adoption on microvascular function and assess the endothelial glycocalyx as a biomarker of cardiovascular response to DASH/SRD. Phase 1 of the study is a crossover-randomized comparison of DASH/SRD vs. control diet for two weeks each, and Phase 2 a 6-month extension to promote DASH/SRD adherence. The salt-sensitive phenotype will be defined by between-diet changes in 24-hour mean BP during Phase 1. In Phase 2, the efficacy of motivational interviewing-based counseling and the Women's and Men's Hypertension Experiences and Emerging Lifestyles Intervention (WHEELS-I), a tailored messaging program, to sustain DASH/SRD adherence, will be compared. Echocardiography and arterial tonometry will be used to assess HFpEF-related cardiovascular parameters during short- and longer-term dietary modification and their interaction with salt-sensitivity. In vivo microscopy and novel blood testing will assess microvascular function and the integrity of the endothelial glycocalyx, a blood vessel lining that is sodium-responsive and may mediate the adverse effects of salt- sensitivity. This proposal is innovative because it represents the first study to examine salt-sensitivity as a factor promoting HFpEF in veterans with HTN and metabolic syndrome, the highest risk group for incident HFpEF. Moreover, it aims to link microvascular dysfunction, an important pathway in human HFpEF, with endothelial glycocalyx damage, a potential biomarker for sodium-mediated vascular risk. The proposed research is significant because it will vertically advance our understanding of how dietary factors contribute to the pathophysiology of HFpEF, a major and growing health threat to veterans."
"9469597","Project Summary/Abstract Recent clinical reports indicate that chronic psychological stress may significantly increase the risk of developing Alzheimer?s Disease (AD). A major coordinator of the stress response is corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), a neuropeptide that is released in response to perception of stressful stimuli. CRH signaling has been shown to be able to induce increases in amyloid beta (A?) peptide levels and tau phosphorylation in mouse models of A? pathology. The largest effort towards targeting the CRH signaling pathway has focused on CRH receptor antagonists, Unfortunately, clinical trials implementing these CRH receptor antagonists have been unable to show clinical efficacy. Therefore, while dysregulation of CRH signaling is implicated in a plethora of highly prevalent stress related disorders in addition to AD, receptor- based interventions have not shown to be able to effectively target the pathway in humans. We propose the creation and testing of novel immunotherapeutic approaches to decrease CRH signaling in the brain. Aim 1: Develop anti-CRH immunotherapies and evaluate their ability to engage CRH and block engagement with its high affinity receptor the CRHR1. As our lab has shown that CRH has direct effects on A? production12 that are independent of its action on the CRHR1 receptor, we aim to target CRH directly by developing both active vaccines and monoclonal antibodies against CRH. Then evaluate several candidate Anti- CRH monoclonal antibodies and characterize their CRH-neutralizing properties in vitro. We will then take the most promising monoclonal antibodies and convert them to single chain variable fragment (scFv) DNA constructs that we can than transduce in the brains of mice using recombinant Adeno Associated Virus (rAAV). Specific Aim 2: Evaluate ability of immunotherapies to block acute CRH responses in vivo. I will test the ability of the anti-CRH vaccine, monoclonal antibody, and scFv to block acute stress-induced increases in corticosterone in mice following acute or subacute stress. This experiment will test whether these immunotherapies are able to neutralize CRH within the hypophyseal portal system, thereby blocking activation of the Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Axis. This will be followed by testing the ability of our immunotherapies to block acute stress-induced increases in A? peptide and tau phosphorylation, evaluating CRH neutralization more broadly throughout the mouse brain. Aim 3: Evaluate the efficacy of active and passive immunotherapeutic approaches in mouse models of A? and tau deposition. We intend to test the efficacy of an active vaccine, a monoclonal antibody, and one rAAV scFv construct as therapies in in vivo models relevant to AD. These studies will evaluate the ability of our immunotherapies to block stress-induced exacerbations of A? and tau pathologies in CRND8 APP overexpressing and rTg4510 mutant tau overexpressing mouse models."
"9351676","The overall goal of this proposal is to identify strategies that target the orexin brain network that regulates spontaneous physical activity, and the associated caloric expenditure. This energy expenditure is referred to as non-exercise activity thermogenesis (NEAT), and we propose that this can be exploited to develop new therapies for weight gain prevention and weight loss in those unable to exercise. The specific objectives are to determine which sub-population of orexin neurons are associated with the most robust effect on NEAT; whether therapy length influence the effectiveness of this targeted NEAT therapy; and finally, whether serotonin in a specific brain area, the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN), modulates the calories produced by this targeted NEAT therapy. The significance is the potential to discover a new therapy for Veterans needing to lose weight or for preventing weight gain in Veterans with limited options for formal exercise, thus reducing the burden of obesity and associated co-morbidities. Drugs targeting orexin and serotonin receptors are already clinically available, providing proof-of-concept that these drugs could be successfully manipulated for human health. The novelty lies in the idea to create a therapy based on promotion of NEAT; our newly established methods to study brain networks using Designer Receptors Exclusively activated by Designer Drugs (DREADDs); our animal models for studying orexin, a neuropeptide that significantly increases NEAT; and newly obtained equipment for allowing sophisticated quantification of NEAT."
"9145863","DATA INTEGRATION CORE PROJECT SUMMARY  The scientific goal of the Medical University of South Carolina Transdisciplinary Collaborative Center (MUSC  TCC) is to conduct translational research to understand the dynamic interaction between biological, social,  psychological, behavioral, and clinical factors and health care and disease outcomes to determine the most  effective ways to integrate these data into precision medicine approaches to promote health equity using  allostatic load (AL) as a framework. To do this, it is essential to develop robust strategies and methods to  harmonize diverse types of data on key biologic factors as well as data obtained by patient self-report and  electronic health records. The Data Integration Core will create new knowledge about allostasis and  estimation of allostatic load by integrating data from projects within the MUSC TCC with supplemental  information about individuals and populations. Specifically, the Data Integration Core will create  databases/registries that bring together the diverse types of data generated in bench experiments with clinical  measurements derived from the electronic health record (EHR) and EHR data on evolution of diseases over  time. This resource will be generated as part of the following specific aims: 1) Create a standards-based  resource using nationally-recognized tools including REDCap and Informatics for Integrating Bench to  Bedside(i2b2) for integration of data on the tumor micro environments derived from proteoglycan analyses of  prostate tissue and clinical studies of impacts of glucocorticoids on pathways for vitamin D effects; 2) Integrate  clinical and experimental data into longitudinal patient records to expand data sets to represent the  chronological order of significant clinical and social events surrounding the timing of a critical cancer diagnosis;  3) Develop natural language processing-based tools to extract discrete details on social stressors from  clinicians' notes and merge these data with clinical data within the i2b2 environment; and 4) Use data mining  strategies to determine the temporal links between AL and disease risk and outcomes."
"9348828","World-wide, spurious thrombosis accounts for 1 of 4 non-communicable disease deaths. Cardiovascular disease is a leading killer of aging US veterans and is the major cause of death in older female veterans. Understanding how to modulate thrombosis will significantly aide the VA's mission to improve veterans' health. Normally platelets respond to vascular damage and secrete granule cargo that are essential for recruiting more platelets and for generating a thrombus. This releasate promotes normal sequelae but can also contribute to occlusive pathologies such as strokes and heart attacks. In platelets, VAMPs, SNAP-23, and Syntaxin-11 form a membrane-spanning complex that mediates exocytosis. Formation of this complex requires a host of SNARE-regulators, e.g., Munc18b, STXBP5/tomosyn-1, and granuphilin/SLP4; however, the mechanisms by which these proteins control the complexity of the platelet release reaction (its rate, extent, and content) is uncertain. Platelets are also capable of other cellular processes (i.e., RNA splicing, translation, glycosylation, autophagy); however, their effects on platelet function are still unknown. Our data suggest that endocytosis affects thrombus growth by modulating platelet spreading and platelet-platelet contacts. Our goal is to manipulate the membrane trafficking in platelets, both endocytosis and exocytosis, in order to modulate occlusive thrombosis with only modest effects on hemostasis. To reach this goal, we must probe the molecular mechanisms of exocytosis. Our specific focus will be on Syntaxin-11 regulators. We will also use an endocytosis defective mouse strain to define the roles of endocytosis in thrombosis and hemostasis. Two aims are proposed: 1) Define the network of protein-protein interactions that affect Syntaxin-11-mediated membrane fusion and granule cargo release; and 2) Determine the roles of platelet endocytosis in hemostasis. To complete these aims, we will employ biochemical assays to define the interactions between the SNARE regulators and in vitro and in vivo functional assays, using transgenic mice, to define the roles of the specific Syntaxin-11 regulators and of endocytosis in thrombosis and hemostasis. Our results will expand the understanding of the molecular requirements and the sequence of protein-protein interactions controlling platelet exocytosis. We will also expand the mechanistic understanding of what cellular processes platelets can perform (i.e., endocytosis) and why they are important. Our results will be significant to the field since they will provide the needed mechanistic insights to identify potential targets for therapeutic intervention and to evaluate the relevance of the increasing volume of gene/risk associations that are guiding patient treatment strategies. This will enhance the anti-thrombotic treatment options available for the care of aging veterans."
"9442314","Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has emerged as the most prevalent chronic liver disease, especially among US veterans. NAFLD is critically linked to inflammation, insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, and the metabolic syndrome. Recent advances in NAFLD and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) studies indicate that gut microbiota exerts a significant role in the disease progression by affecting host metabolic balance and immune response. The ?metabolic endotoxemia? and elevated circulating levels of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) due to disruption of intestinal barrier function and free long chain fatty acids (FFA) are implicated in the stimulation of systemic inflammation and insulin resistance, both of which are positively correlated with the development and progression of NAFLD. Although the mechanism by which LPS/FFA induce hepatic lipotoxicity is still not fully understood, LPS/FFA-induced expression of inflammatory cytokines such as TNF- ? and activation of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress signaling pathway, known as the unfolded protein response (UPR), are major contributors. Furthermore, micro-RNAs (miR), small noncoding RNAs (~22 nucleotides), have recently been found to be potent regulators of lipid and cholesterol metabolism. Alterations in miR expression have also been linked to LPS/FFA-induced inflammatory response, hepatic lipotoxicity and insulin resistance as well as disease progression of NAFLD in the clinic. Berberine (BBR), an isoquinoline alkaloid isolated from many medicinal herbs, has been used to treat various infectious disorders for more than 3,000 years in Asia. Numerous studies have shown that BBR has various pharmacological activities including anti-inflammatory, hypoglycemic and lipid-lowering effects. Importantly, BBR represents a novel cholesterol- lowering drug through a unique mechanism distinct from the current statin therapy. These studies strongly indicate that BBR is a promising natural therapeutic agent for NAFLD/NASH. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying BBR?s anti-inflammatory and lipid-lowering properties remain to be fully identified. We have demonstrated that BBR inhibits ER stress-mediated TNF-? and IL-6 expression through regulating the RNA-binding protein (RBP) HuR in macrophages. Recent advances in miR research have identified specific panels of miRs as major regulators of inflammation, lipid metabolism and metabolic disorders, such as miR-155, miR-125a-5p, miR-33, miR-34a, and miR-122. In addition, it has been reported that BBR exerted protective effects against high fat Western diet (WD)-induced NAFLD/NASH via modulating gut microbiota and bile acid metabolism. Our preliminary studies also indicate that 1) BBR significantly inhibited WD-induced hepatic lipid accumulation and systemic inflammation in animal models; 2) BBR inhibited FFA-induced ER stress and lipid accumulation in hepatocytes; 3) BBR inhibited FFA-induced miR-34a expression in hepatocytes and LPS-induced miR-125a-5p expression in macrophages; 4) The expression of miR-34a was significantly down-regulated in C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP, a major player of ER stress-mediated apoptosis) knock out (CHOP-/-) primary hepatocytes; 5) BBR significantly reduced WD-induced increase of intestinal permeability; 6) ER stress- and LPS-induced suppression of intestinal epithelial cell renewal was rescued by deletion of the CHOP. Based on these observations, we HYPOTHESIZE that BBR inhibits WD- induced hepatic lipotoxicity by inhibiting ER stress and inflammatory response. The following two specific aims are proposed to test this hypothesis. Aim #1:To determine the mechanism by which BBR inhibits LPS/FFA-induced ER stress and the inflammatory response in hepatocytes and macrophages; Aim #2: To identify the mechanism by which BBR inhibits WD-induced hepatic lipotoxicity and further test the therapeutic effect of BBR on WD-induced hepatic lipotoxicity in a novel in vivo NAFLD/NASH model."
