"9382844","Chronic rejection of transplanted organs remains the primary cause of graft failure over time despite advances in immunosuppression. Memory T cells and production of antibodies by B cells are recognized as important mediators of chronic rejection but are not effectively controlled by current immunosuppression regimens. We find that antibody-independent functions of B cells also play a significant role in the pathogenesis of alloimmunity and chronic rejection by presenting antigen and providing costimulation to T cells. Here, we will test the hypothesis that B cell interactions with T cells play a key role in the development, maintenance and recall of T cell memory. We propose to (a) delineate when, where and which B cells interact with T cells in shaping memory responses, and (b) test whether blocking these interactions will prevent chronic rejection. Non-selective targeting of B cells by global depletion strategies may be detrimental as it also removes B cells with regulatory functions. Understanding which specific B cell populations interact with T cells, when and where they function to sustain long-lived memory is therefore a clinically relevant and significant goal. Results from these proposed studies would allow us to develop novel therapies that inhibit T cell memory and prevent chronic rejection by targeting specific functions, subpopulations and/or migration of B cells."
"9396770","PROJECT SUMMARY  An emerging therapy for non-ischemic cardiomyopathy involves the delivery of human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs). Clinical trials document modest benefits on cardiac contractility, underscoring a need to better understand and exploit the underlying mechanisms governing hMSCs-cardiomyocyte (hCMs) interactome.  Recent studies on hMSC-mediated heart therapies demonstrated that paracrine signaling?via secreted factors?is a crucial mediator of reduced cardiac fibrosis and enhanced angiogenesis. Moreover, hMSC paracrine factors have been shown to impact contractility by altering cardiomyocyte ion channel/pump activity. However, these findings fail to identify the key components of the hMSC secretome for enhancing contractility. We propose utilizing three-dimensional human engineered cardiac tissues (hECTs) as an in vitro model to investigate the role of hMSC exosomes in enhancement of cardiac contractility.  Our lab recently discovered that hMSCs enhance hECT contractile force predominantly through paracrine signaling, counteracting adverse risks of hMSC-hCM heterocellular coupling. Importantly, we discovered that the exosomal component of the hMSC secretome is necessary and sufficient for hMSC-paracrine mediated enhancement of hECT contractility. Furthermore, by utilizing a systems biology approach and integrating hECT contractile function results with exosomal miRNA data, we predicted exosomal miRNA-21 as a lead candidate responsible for the favorable contractile effects of hMSC paracrine signaling. We later validated with qPCR that miRNA-21 levels are increased in hECTs supplemented with hMSC exosomes and hMSC total conditioned media relative to control, motivating our central hypothesis that exosomal miRNA-21 plays a key role in hMSC paracrine-mediated enhancement of human engineered cardiac tissue contractile performance.  In testing this hypothesis, I will directly address an NHLBI topic of special interest (HL-142) by studying the role of exosomes as paracrine mediators in cardiovascular disease. In Aim 1, I will identify the role of exosomal miRNA-21 in hMSC-mediated enhancement of hECT contractility by: 1) treating hECTs with exosomes derived from hMSCs with miRNA-21 inhibitor (Sub-aim 1A); and 2) formulated lipidoid nanoparticle delivery of miRNA-21 mimic into hECTs (Sub-aim 1B). In Aim 2, I will test the role of hMSC exosomes on recovery of contractility using in vitro hECT models of acquired (Sub-aim 2A) and genetic (Sub-aim 2B) non- ischemic heart failure.  Overall, the project is designed to frame the research within a clinical context, and provide a rigorous multi- disciplinary training in tissue engineering, systems biology, electrophysiology, stem cell biology, and biochemistry as a solid foundation on which to build my career as a future physician-scientist."
"9386724","Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is an adverse psychiatric condition that occurs after exposure to extremely stressful life events. PTSD patients also develop a variety of disorders with an inflammatory component. While majority of the studies indicate that there is an excessive inflammatory state in PTSD, the precise mechanisms of immunomodulation seen during PTSD are not clear. Recently, we have made an exciting observation that the severity of PTSD is correlated with greater inflammation and a broadly dysregulated microRNA (miR) profile with numerous targets that regulate inflammatory T cell response. Specifically, we noted that numerous downregulated miRs in PTSD patients targeted components of the nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) pathway, crucial for the activation, proliferation and differentiation of T cells. In addition to the NFAT proteins themselves, the serine-threonine protein phosphatase calcineurin subunits A (isoforms PPP3CA, PPP2CB, and PPP3CC) and B (isoforms PPP3R1 and PPP3R2), which activate NFAT through dephosphorylation, were found to serve as targets for numerous dysregulated miRs in PTSD patients. The status of the T cell regulation, and in particular, the NFAT pathway in PTSD has not been evaluated thus far. Based on our preliminary studies, we will test the central hypothesis that PTSD associates, at least in part, with dysregulation in the epigenetic mechanisms that alter NFAT signaling pathway leading to a pro-inflammatory state. We will pursue these studies trauma-exposed PTSD patients when compared to trauma-exposed non-PTSD controls. We will pursue 3 specific aims: Aim 1: We will identify the mechanisms through which miR dysregulation leads to alterations in NFAT signaling pathway leading to an inflammatory state in PTSD patients. Aim 2: We will determine whether PTSD triggers differential DNA methylation of specific miR and/or targets of NFAT signaling pathway components in T cells leading to pro-inflammatory response. Aim 3: We will test the role of histone modifications in the expression of miRs on NFAT components in PTSD patients.  Together, our studies will delineate the epigenetic mechanisms underlying signaling pathways that lead to alterations in NFAT signaling and consequent T cell dysregulation and excess inflammation in PTSD patients. Our studies also aim to identify epigenetic biomarkers of PTSD that will help in the early diagnosis and treatment."
"9189793","Background: Over 6,000 Veterans are admitted with an acute ischemic stroke annually within the VA Healthcare System. Nearly 25% of all strokes are recurrent events and constitute a leading cause of disability and death within our Veteran population, especially among the 75% of Veterans with stroke and hypertension. Current VA/DoD and American Heart Association/American Stroke Association (AHA/ASA) guidelines stress the importance of delivering guideline concordant management of hypertension, given the strong association between goal blood pressure and decreased morbidity and mortality, especially during the six-month post- stroke period, when most stroke and non-stroke related hospitalizations and deaths occur. Previous Quality Enhancement Research Initiative (QUERI) work has shown that many Veterans 6-months after their stroke do not have their blood pressure optimally controlled. Most Veterans receive their post-stroke risk hypertension care within VA Primary Care and Patient Aligned Care Teams (PACTs). Work performed during the current Health Services Research and Development (HSR&D) Career Development Award (CDA) period has identified several areas for intervention that can assist outpatient providers in Primary Care/PACT to better manage hypertension using existing VA infrastructure, and has led to the development of a bundled, evidence-based, `Post Stroke Hypertension Improvement Intervention.' Therefore, focusing on prevention of future strokes by implementing an intervention to effectively treat hypertension among Veterans with stroke is necessary to improve outcomes in this population. Objective: To: (1) evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of a pilot intervention, implemented at a single VAMC providing suboptimal blood pressure management to post-stroke Veterans, during the `high-risk,' 6- month period post-stroke, such that a more refined intervention can be developed and further informed by key stakeholders, end users, and strategic partners; and (2) collect metrics related to hypertension control at the intervention and four control sites. Methods: A pilot will be initiated at the Michael E. DeBakey VAMC. The Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) conceptual framework and Systems Redesign strategies will be used to evaluate the implementation of the intervention. The feasibility and acceptability of the implementation strategy will be assessed via qualitative interviews with end users of the intervention. Blood pressure will be measured at baseline, 3-months, and 6-months. The distributions and central tendencies of baseline demographic and patient-, provider-, and facility-level characteristics for continuous variables will be examined graphically and by summary statistics. Categorical variables will be examined by calculating frequency distributions. We will match, based on patient volume and mean facility-level blood pressure, our intervention and control sites. Hypothesis: We believe that we can: (1) determine the feasibility and acceptability of a pilot intervention designed to improve post-stroke hypertension control 6-months after discharge; and (2) collect metrics related to hypertension control among Veterans participating in the intervention and four control sites to estimate effect size for a future, larger trial. Conclusion: Interventions that improve management of hypertension among Veterans with ischemic stroke are necessary to prevent recurrent strokes; implementation science strategies can assess the uptake and sustainability of this intervention."
"9418543","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There is a lack of research on systematic lupus erythematosus (SLE), a multisystem, chronic, autoimmune disease that shows clear patterns along racial and gender lines. African American women not only have a greater prevalence of SLE, but also experience greater severity and faster progression compared to their White counterparts, being more frequently affected by organ damage and comorbid conditions that emerge as a consequence of disease activity and disease-related chronic inflammation and tissue damage. Racial disparities in SLE complications and mortality are well documented; however, the reasons for these disparities are poorly understood. To address these gaps in knowledge, this study aims to: (1) examine the role that psychosocial stressors experienced by African American women have in exacerbating SLE in this population; (2) identify social factors and psychological resources that are protective or buffer the effects of stress on SLE-related health declines; and (3) explore the biological implications of psychosocial stressors and SLE, in relation to elevated systemic inflammation and accelerated aging at the cellular level.  The experiences of African American women with SLE are particularly challenging, and include psychosocial stressors related to disease management, as well as disproportionately greater poverty and living in disadvantaged communities; in addition to routine stressors such as those associated with work, family and relationship demands, parenting, and caregiving. Experiences of racial discrimination constitute a qualitatively distinct source of psychosocial stress, adding o existing everyday hassles. In this study, we will examine how these stressors impact SLE severity and progression through a longitudinal study design. We will collect three waves of data from 480 African American women, all with validated SLE. Participants will be recruited from the Georgians Organized Against Lupus (GOAL) cohort, a truly one-of-a-kind, population-based study of SLE in Atlanta, including a full spectrum of patients from all levels of socioeconomic strata, across a range of disease severity. We will examine the effects of racial discrimination, financial and neighborhood-related strains, and other stressors associated with various role strains. Potential protective factors, including those related to racial identity and social suppor will also be assessed. We will collect dried blood spots (DBS), a minimally invasive alternative to venipuncture, to examine indicators of biological dysregulation which we hypothesize will be impacted by psychosocial stress as well as SLE activity. This study will be the most in-depth investigation of the multifactorial nature of psychosocial stressors and their impact on SLE disease progression among African American women, and thus fills an important gap in the science on this understudied disease. This research is important in advancing knowledge of how aspects of the social environment and psychological processes impact health among African American women with SLE, and also contributes to scientific knowledge on the underpinnings of racial disparities in the progression of this disease."
"9587670","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Abstract The 2014, 2016, and 2018 International Hearing Aid Research Conferences (IHCON) will be the eighth, ninth, and tenth meeting of a biennial research conference formed by combination of two previous hearing aid research conferences; the Lake Arrowhead Conference, Issues in Advanced Hearing Aid Research, sponsored by the House Research Institute (HRI); and the Hearing Aid Research and Development Conference co-sponsored by the National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders (NIDCD) and the Department of Veterans' Affairs (DVA). The purpose of the previous conferences has been to advance our knowledge and to facilitate progress in research and development through the exchange of current research findings and technical advancements related to the treatment of hearing impairment with hearing aids. A hallmark of the conferences was their ability to draw together the disciplines and specialties essential to the advancement of hearing aid research. A primary goal of IHCON meetings is to build upon the strengths of the previous conferences to offer a multidisciplinary research conference that will better meet the needs of the hearing aid research and development field."
"9515142","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Each year more than 100,000 US women seek emergency medical care after sexual assault (SA). Most women do not return for/receive further care related to SA after initial emergency evaluation. Thus the emergency care visit represents a unique opportunity to identify SA survivors for preventive interventions to improve recovery. Cross-sectional studies indicate that chronic musculoskeletal pain (MSP) is reported by many SA survivors and is associated with substantial suffering and poor health outcomes. However, no prospective studies evaluating chronic MSP outcomes after SA have been performed, and therefore a firm etiologic link between SA and chronic MSP has not been established. In a recent prospective pilot study (n = 83), the investigators found that 41% of women SA survivors enrolled developed chronic moderate or severe MSP. Initial pain scores collected from all women approached for pilot study participation showed that more than half of those at high risk of chronic MSP consented and enrolled in the pilot study. In addition, data collected indicate that women SA survivors who participated in the pilot study are the same group of SA survivors who would be willing to participate in preventive intervention trials. However, currently no informatio exists regarding key factors that influence the transition from acute to chronic post-SA MSP to inform the design of such trials. Available evidence suggests that posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms may be key factors mediating the transition from acute to chronic post-SA MSP. PTSD symptom clusters have been found to mediate the transition from acute to chronic MSP in other trauma populations, and the investigator's pilot data support these relationships in the study population. Importantly, despite evidence that PTSD symptoms are key factors mediating chronic post-SA MSP development, available data also indicate that not all individuals with acute MSP develop PTSD symptoms, and not all individuals with PTSD symptoms develop chronic MSP. This suggests that important individual differences moderate these relationships. Available evidence, and the investigator's pilot data, suggests that genetic variants affecting the function of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) and catecholaminergic systems constitute such important individual differences. The investigators propose a prospective cohort study of women SA survivors (n = 900) evaluated 1 week, 6 weeks, 6 months, and 12 months after SA. A methodological approach including Confirmatory Factor Analyses and Structural Equation Modeling will be used to test the hypotheses that chronic MSP is common in the study population, that PTSD symptom clusters mediate the relationship between acute and chronic MSP after SA, and that the proposed genetic factors moderate these relationships. Results of this groundbreaking study will generalize to a large population of women SA survivors who experience a high burden of chronic post-SA MSP, and will inform the development of preventive interventions for this understudied population."
"9379465","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Environmental exposure and endogenous metabolism both give rise to the alkylation of DNA, and DNA alkylation represents the major mechanism of action for a number of commonly prescribed cancer chemotherapeutic agents. Thus, assessing how alkylated DNA lesions compromise the flow of genetic information by altering the efficiency and fidelity of DNA replication and transcription and how these lesions are repaired will provide important knowledge for understanding the implications of DNA alkylation in the etiology for developing human diseases. Such knowledge will also form the basis for developing better strategies for cancer chemotherapy. The emphasis of this application is placed on a group of alkylated thymidine lesions which have been shown to persist in mammalian tissues or have been detected at substantially elevated levels in lymphocyte samples of humans exposed to cigarette smoke. We will employ an innovative and multi- pronged approach, including synthetic organic chemistry, mass spectrometry-based bioanalytical chemistry, and molecular biology to achieve a molecular-level understanding about how the under-investigated group of alkylated thymidine lesions impede DNA replication and transcription in cells, and induce mutations in these processes. We will also assess the implications of nucleotide excision repair and base excision repair pathways in the repair of these lesions in cells. The outcome of the proposed research will bring our understanding of this largely overlooked group of alkylated DNA lesions to a significantly higher level."
"9390767","PROJECT SUMMARY Bacterial infections following childbirth, so-called puerperal infections, cause morbidity in 5 to 10% of all pregnant women globally. In most instances the infection is limited to the reproductive tract but at low frequency the infection spreads to the blood resulting in life-threatening sepsis, puerperal sepsis. Pathogens causing puerperal sepsis include the group A Streptococcus (GAS, S. pyogenes), which is the most common cause of severe maternal puerperal infections and death worldwide. GAS epidemiological data gained over the course of the last fifty years identifies a serotype-specific variability in the ability of GAS to cause disease. Of relevance to this proposal, serotype M28 GAS isolates are non-randomly associated with cases of puerperal sepsis. The molecular basis of why serotype M28 isolates cause puerperal sepsis at a significantly higher rate relative to those of other serotypes is to be investigated in this proposal. More specifically, the goal of the proposed research is to characterize whether the presence of a genomic island, termed `region of difference 2' (RD2), is key to the enhanced ability of serotype M28 GAS to cause puerperal sepsis. Sequence analysis of RD2 is consistent with this element being horizontally transferred into M28 GAS from group B Streptococci (GBS, S. agalactiae), an important finding given that GBS are a common constituent of the normal vaginal microflora and are also a major cause of neonatal invasive infections. Specific Aim 1: Test the hypothesis that RD2 enhances the ability of serotype M28 GAS isolates to both colonize the female reproductive tract and cause sepsis. To facilitate testing our hypothesis we recently constructed RD2 deletion mutant and complemented mutant derivatives of a representative M28 isolate. The parental, mutant, and complemented strains will be compared in tissue culture adherence assays, in growth assays using whole human blood (as a model of sepsis), and in a mouse model of vaginal colonization. Specific Aim 2: Test the hypothesis that the RD2 element alters the abundance of transcripts of core chromosomally-encoded virulence factors. Five putative transcription factors and two putative small regulatory RNAs are encoded within RD2. To test whether these putative regulators have targets outside of the RD2 region we will perform transcriptome comparisons between our parental and RD2 deletion mutant strains (via RNAseq). Comparisons will be performed following GAS growth in an ex vivo model of invasive infection. RNAseq data will be verified by targeted quantitative RT-PCR and Western analyses. Completion of the proposed research will advance our understanding of strain emergence and phenotypic heterogeneity in a prevalent Gram-positive pathogen. Specifically, the data would inform on the importance of RD2 with respect to the association of M28 GAS isolates with puerperal sepsis, and thereby provide a link between GAS gene content and clinical observations."
"9379835","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Complement is a part of innate immunity and plays a key role in host defense. However, if not properly regulated, activated complement can cause inflammatory injury. Recent works have identified complement as a major pathogenic pathway in many human immunological and inflammatory diseases. Among them, dense deposit disease (DDD) is a rare kidney disease caused by dysregulation of the alternative pathway (AP) of complement activation. DDD is characterized by the presence of electron- dense deposits within the glomerular basement membrane of the kidney. Known also as membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis type II (MPGN type II), DDD belongs to the recently introduced pathological entity called C3 glomerulopathy whose definition is glomerular pathology characterized by C3 accumulation with no or limited immunoglobulin deposition. Approximately 10% of DDD patients also develop vision problems with dense deposits underneath retinal pigment epithelial cells that resemble drusen deposits in the eyes of age-related macular degeneration patients. Prognosis of DDD is poor since current treatments are largely nonspecific and about 50% patients eventually progress to end stage renal failure. Mechanistic and therapeutic studies of human DDD have been hampered by the lack of appropriate animal models. We have recently generated a robust mouse model of DDD displaying both kidney and retinal pathologies. The objective of this application is to use this novel mouse model to investigate the pathogenic mechanisms of complement-mediated kidney and retinal injury in DDD and to test the activity of various anti-complement agents in preventing or reversing the kidney and eye pathologies. Our long term goal is to better understand how dysregulated AP complement leads to DDD and other complement-mediated inflammatory disorders and to provide proof of principle for developing novel anti-complement therapies for such human diseases."
"9378422","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term goal of this project is to characterize the mechanisms that specify the fate of the germline, a fundamental problem in developmental biology. In all animals, the founder cells of the germline (primordial germ cells) display two conserved characteristics: they possess germ granules, RNA granules specific to the germline, and they express members of the Nanos family of RNA-binding proteins. The goal of this proposal is to understand how germ granules and Nanos function together to specify the fate of primordial germ cells. In preliminary work, we have found that PGCs that lack Nanos activity prematurely activates the expression of ~1000 genes normally expressed in oocytes and somatic cells, a phenotype also seen in mutants that lack the Polycomb Repressive Complex. Specific Aim I will identify the mechanisms used by Nanos to prevent this massive gene mis-regulation. We have already identified one promising candidate Nanos target: LIN-15B, a likely component of the DRM transcription factor complex that activates gene expression in oocytes. Specific Aim II will examine the role of a new group of germ granule proteins we recently characterized. The MEG proteins form stabilizing scaffolds around the central cores of each germ granule. Our genetic analyses indicate that the MEGs, but not the proteins in the core, are essential for PGC fate. We will investigate how the MEGs, predicted to be intrinsically-disordered with no recognizable domain, function with Nanos to specify PGCs. Two technical breakthroughs support this application. First we have worked out methods to isolate PGCs in large enough numbers to determine their transcriptome by RNAseq. We will use this method to define how Nanos and germ granule proteins affect the PGC transcriptome at a genome-wide level. Second we have developed a highly efficient genome editing method, using CRISPR/Cas9, that allows us to mutate, tag, delete and replace any gene of interest in just 4 days. This method gives us unprecedented genetic and biochemical access to the genes and proteins that are the focus of this application."
"9378415","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV) is a ssRNA (-) nairovirus that produces fever, prostration, and severe hemorrhages in humans. Fatality rates associated with CCHFV range from 5- 80% based on phylogenetic variation of the virus, transmission route, and different treatment facilities. Originally identified in Russia and he Congo, CCHFV has rapidly spread across large sections of Europe, Asia, and Africa. Recently, U.S. citizen traffic has increased substantially to the regions endemic with CCHFV, specifically South Central Asia. As a result, there is a substantial risk for transmission of CCHFV and/or its tick vector to the United States. Intriguingly, CCHFV is not the only nairovirus that threatens the public. Nairobi Sheep Disease virus (NSDV) as well as nairoviruses Hazara, Dugbe and Erve can cause human disease of varying severity and economic distress. Currently, there is no vaccine or prophylactic available for treatment of CCHF or other any other nairovirus related diseases. Recent reports have identified a viral homologue of the ovarian tumor protease (vOTU) located within the nairovirus genome and implicated its possible involvement in down-regulation of the Interferon type 1 immune response through cleavage of post-translational modifying proteins ubiquitin (Ub) and Ub-like interferon-simulated gene 15 (ISG15). As a result, it has been suggested to be a virulence factor. This proposal will determine whether dual deubiquitinating and deISGylating activities are conserved functions of this subclass of proteases in vitro and in vivo. Additionally, these experiments will gain insight into their mechanism of recognition for Ub and ISG15 allowing greater predictability of currently unknown vOTUs. The proposal will also seek to evaluate a potential correlation between the in vitro activity/substrate specificity of these nairovirus vOTUs and overall virulence of the nairoviruses in question. The resulting information will also provide critical insight into the role of vOTUs ply in viruses that may ultimately have practicality in the development of prophylactics targeting vOTUs."
"9378738","Rates of mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) are high among combat veterans, with reports suggesting 10-20% of Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans meet diagnostic criteria for mTBI, the vast majority of which being related to explosive blasts. There is on-going debate as to whether blast-related mTBI may result in long-term neuropsychological impairment, given the paucity of positive findings, despite on-going complaints of cognitive difficulties within this cohort. One possible explanation for this discrepancy is that traditional neuropsychological test procedures may lack sensitivity in capturing subtle deficits in everyday functioning in blast-related mTBI. Prospective memory (PM) is the ability to remember to execute an action at a certain point in the future, or is the fulfillment of delayed intentions. PM may be more sensitive to the functional difficulties described by some Veterans with mTBI (e.g., forgetting appointments) than those domains typically assessed (e.g., executive functions, attention and retrospective memory). Results of functional neuroimaging studies suggest that PM is dependent on a frontally-guided cortical network comprised of the anterior prefrontal cortex, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, the anterior cingulate and parietal cortex. Neurostructural damage to the white matter pathways that integrate this network presents a possible underlying mechanism for PM disruption in mTBI. To date, few studies have investigated the effect of mTBI on PM, and no published studies have investigated the neurocircuitry of PM in OEF/OIF Veterans with a history of blast-related mTBI. The proposed study aims to utilize neuropsychological assessment and an integrated multi-modal neuroimaging analysis to study prospective memory (PM) functioning in Veterans with histories of blast-related mTBI. Eighty participants will be recruited from within an existing VA-funded TBI research study and will include Veterans with a history of blast-related mTBI (n = 40) or deployed Veterans without a history of mTBI (n = 40). Participants will complete a broad neurocognitive assessment which includes PM questionnaires and objective measures of PM. Veterans will also undergo an MRI scan which includes diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and completion of a PM fMRI task. The study aims are to investigate PM performance in Veterans with histories of blast-related mTBI, investigate the neural network associated with PM functions via integration of fMRI and DTI modalities and determine whether this network is disrupted for Veterans with mTBI. The candidate is a current VA postdoctoral fellow studying mTBI and neuroimaging research, has trained in the neuropsychological assessment of mTBI, has demonstrated a capacity to learn neuroimaging research methods across multiple imaging modalities and has collaborated with the proposed mentorship team on several prior grant applications and manuscripts related to neuroimaging and cognitive functions following TBI. Successful completion of this VA Career Development Award-2 with advance the candidate further toward a long-term research career goal of being an independent clinical researcher in the VA focusing on the integration of neuroimaging and neuropsychological assessment in the study of TBI. The CDA-2 will lead to independence not only through the experience of conducting the proposed research and training plan, but also by providing critical pilot data for a VA Merit Award. The specific immediate training objectives of this CDA-2 are to: (1) develop expertise in integrating neuroimaging modalities including fMRI and DTI, (2) develop expertise in the study of prospective memory, (3) achieve proficiency in advanced biostatistics and (4) continue my professional development aimed toward transitioning from a postdoctoral fellow into an independent VA clinical scientist. These goals will be achieved via collaboration with the identified mentorship team that will provide further specialized training in neuropsychological assessment, TBI research and neuroimaging techniques."
"9584969","Project Summary: Vaccines are the most effective form of health care. The development of new vaccines would greatly benefit the treatment of many diseases including cancer, malaria and enterotoxigenic E. coli. Vaccines for some of these diseases remain tantalizing close to reality, but are not yet effective enough for wide- spread use. Vaccine creation is still largely an empirical process. Recently, dendritic cells have been identified as the active agent in directing the immune system and the main player in many effective vaccines including yellow fever virus vaccine. Dendritic cells contain a series of receptors stimulated by molecular agonists from foreign pathogens. The most effective vaccines have been found to stimulate these receptors in concert using a series of molecular agonists to direct either a cytotoxic immune responses or sustained, humoral responses. This response is exemplified by the yellow fever virus vaccines, whose potent immunity is dependent on the activation of four independent toll-like receptors. Several vaccines however do not possess the ability to stimulate this number of different receptors. The arrangement of these molecular agonists in the appropriate time is known to be the key to creating a strong immune response. In the last two years, creating vaccines formulations by mixing these molecular agonists together with target antigens has shown that increased stimulation can be achieved by molecular pairings. Currently however, there are no chemical methods to manipulate these molecular signals, understand their cooperative effects or directly attach them to potential vaccines to enhance immunity. We propose to develop polymeric scaffolding that allows us to create controlled combinations of molecular agonists. We will use these combinations of agonists to study and understand their synergistic activity in stimulating dendritic cells. Our hypothesis is that different combinations should direct the immune system toward greater humoral or cytotoxic immunity. We will also develop methods for coupling our immune programming polymers toward previous vaccines that were not effective enough to become commercially viable including vaccines for enterotoxigenic E. Coli. We will use hetero-telechelic polymer synthesis and an array of bio-conjugation reactions to create a combinatorial library of agonists that target each of the Toll-like and NOD-like receptors on dendritic cells. We will then determine the effect of these combinations using colorimetric and immune assays for effective stimulation. In parallel, we will develop methods for addressing these polymers directly to previously established vaccines. The project is risky, but if successful, could both give researchers a better understanding of the stimulation of the immune system through fundamental chemical discovery and a method of directing the immune response to a weakened whole-cell vaccine."
"9386076","Project Summary: Most human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected people, if not adherent to highly active combination antiretroviral therapy (cART), ultimately succumb to chronic infection. However, some are known as ?elite controllers? (ECs) who demonstrate superior virus control, maintaining virtually undetectable viral loads even in the absence of cART. Although HIV-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) in ECs are critical for viral control and progression status, harnessing CTLs to combat HIV reservoirs remains challenging because little to no viral protein is produced in quiescent CD4+ T cells, rendering this reservoir difficult to detect by the host CTL immune response. Currently available strategies to purge latently HIV-infected cells include ?Shock and Kill,? broadly responsive TCR elicited by therapeutic vaccines, broadly neutralizing monoclonal antibodies, programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1) blockade, and other immune checkpoint blockades. However, none of these strategies efficiently eradicates HIV reservoirs. Our preliminary data showed that strong phosphorylation of a small adaptor molecule, chicken tumor virus number 10 regulator of kinase (Crk), was induced by PD-1 signaling at the center of exhausted HIV-specific CTL immunological synapses. This critical observation prompted us to develop a novel strategy that targets a common master-signaling molecule to restore the function of exhausted CTLs to eradicate HIV reservoirs, which is an approach that is superior to targeting individual inhibitory immunoreceptor. We hypothesize that chronic HIV leads to functional impairment of CTLs via up-regulation of inhibitory receptors and that the resulting downstream phosphorylation of Crk, in turn, prevents CTL activation. We propose that exogenous phosphorylated Crk (pCrk) inhibitor could be used to restore exhausted CTL functions to eradicate HIV reservoirs. We propose the following two aims: (Aim 1) Restore the function of exhausted HIV-specific CTLs against productively infected cells by inhibiting Crk phosphorylation. pCrk inhibitors newly identified using multipronged approaches (including the state-of-the-art Alphascreen, thermal shift assay, in vitro kinase and cellular phosphoflow assay) will be tested to determine whether these pCrk inhibitors can restore functions of exhausted HIV-specific CTLs against productively infected cells. (Aim 2) Restore the function of exhausted HIV-specific CTLs against latently infected cells by inhibiting Crk phosphorylation. To further test the efficacy of pCrk inhibitors, we will determine whether pCrk inhibitors can restore the function of exhausted HIV-specific CTLs against latently infected cells. We will generate latently HIV-infected primary CD4+ T cells from peripheral blood and lymph nodes to compare their sensitivity to killing by exhausted HIV-specific CTLs with and without pCrk inhibitors. If successful, therapeutic use of small-molecule pCrk inhibitors could improve care of chronic HIV patients, restoring exhausted patient CTL defenses. Successful outcomes of this research will lead to the development of a novel immunotherapy to eradicate HIV reservoirs and associated clinical trials."
"9384980","PROJECT SUMMARY In addition to traditional antimicrobials, targeting host defense pathways is an attractive strategy to limit the adverse effect of bacterial infection. One such pathway that has received considerable attention is autophagy, a process by which cellular constituents are sequestered in a double-membrane vesicle that is subsequently targeted to the lysosome for degradation and recycling. Autophagy is suggested to be critical for cell autonomous defense because many bacterial pathogens are detected within double-membrane vesicles upon internalization. Therefore, it is possible that drugs that target autophagy will be useful in a wide range of diseases downstream of bacterial infections. However, in addition to a direct microbicidal mechanism, autophagy has many substrates and cell type-specific functions that may contribute to the outcome of an infection. Thus, we chose to re-examine the role of autophagy in vivo using two model pathogens ? Salmonella enterica Typhimurium and Staphylococcus aureus. We chose to investigate S. Typhimurium because previous in vitro studies extensively demonstrated that this bacterium is targeted for degradation through autophagy. In contrast, in vitro experiments indicate that S. aureus uses the autophagy machinery for intracellular survival. In preliminary data, we demonstrate that inhibiting autophagy in vivo leads to the opposite outcome that is predicted by the literature. Specifically, autophagy mutants were protected from S. Typhimurium and susceptible to S. aureus. The goal of this proposal is to elucidate the physiological mechanism by which autophagy functions during infection by these two important bacterial pathogens. In Aim 1, we will test a model in which S. Typhimurium recruits the autophagy machinery to repair the Salmonella-containing vacuole (SCV) and evade innate immune sensors. In Aim 2, we will define a novel role for autophagy in regulating the cell surface proteome of the host cells, a function that is critical in limiting damage caused by a pore-forming toxin produced by S. aureus. The results from the proposed experiments will challenge the existing paradigm on the role of autophagy in antimicrobial defense and guide the proper use of drugs that target autophagy."
"9379443","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Producing high-affinity antibodies that potently neutralize target pathogens remains a central goal for vaccine research. Many promising vaccine antigens fail to elicit long-lasting protective antibodies due to inefficient generation of high-affinity memory B cells. While memory B cell development is an active area of research, major gaps remain in our understanding of cognate regulation by CD4+ TH cells and the rules governing ongoing evolution of antigen-specific B cell memory. Research Focus: In these recent studies, we demonstrate that all memory B cell responses require antigen-specific mTH cells. Importantly, direct in situ labeling revealed both Bcl-6+ and Blimp-1+ CD4+ TH cells in the follicular regions of reactive LNs after recall. In support of this observation, using single cell T-qPCR, we demonstrate a transcriptional divide between two tetramer-binding CXCR5+ mTFH compartments with differential expression of Bcl-6 and Prdm-1 at recall. Based on these findings, we propose a division in cognate regulatory function with separable mechanisms used by the different mTFH compartments that may also pre-exist at initial priming. We predict that this division of cognate regulatory function can be targeted to control, remodel and re-assort antigen-specific memory B cell fate at antigen recall with high impact on durable immune protection. Specific Aims: We have developed multi-dimensional single cell strategies to track complex cellular behaviors in vivo and can temporally delete of these two major transcriptional repressors in a cell- specific manner using mixed BM chimeras. We will use this approach: SA-1: to study the molecular control of antigen-specific mTFH differentiation. SA-2: to dissect and modify the mechanisms and GC-regulating function of Bcl-6+ mTFH cells SA-3: to examine the cognate regulatory mechanisms used by Prdm-1+ mTFH cells. Impact: We use polyclonal murine models of protein vaccination with state-of-the-art single cell analyses of antigen-specific immune function. These high-resolution studies of model antigens have the capacity to shift the basic conceptual framework that surrounds existing vaccine paradigms. Importantly, these basic new principles and assays can be used to re-design contemporary vaccine formulations that optimize high-affinity B cell immunity to more complex antigens."
"9397377","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT BACKGROUND. Vaso-occlusive pain crises (VOC) are the most common complication in youth with sickle cell disease (SCD) and comprise the leading cause of healthcare utilization. Adolescents with (SCD) are at-risk for experiencing VOCs that may result in vascular and nervous system damage, sensitize neuromodulatory pain circuits, and ultimately affect future pain symptomatology. Stress and pain itself have been cited as potential triggers for VOC and are also associated with physiological stress responses that alter autonomic nervous system (ANS) function. Such ANS changes can lead to vasoconstriction, resulting in reduced peripheral blood flow, further occlusion of SCD red blood cells, and VOC. Social stress has also been linked to maladaptive physiological stress responses and recent data indicate that perceived SCD-related stigma is associated with negative psychosocial and medical outcomes in adolescents. Neuromodulatory interventions (e.g., hypnosis) may represent a promising approach to pain management for youth with SCD. Hypnosis has been shown to reduce activity in supraspinal areas identified as components of the ?pain matrix? as well as increase temperature in the extremities, which may affect autonomic responses and vasodilation. Despite preliminary support for the positive effects of hypnosis on pain outcomes in SCD, no laboratory-based studies exist with pediatric SCD samples and no existing studies have examined how perceived SCD-related stigma may moderate acute pain responses in youth with SCD. Such work may elucidate potential mechanisms underpinning VOC and identify new targets for intervention. SPECIFIC AIMS. This proposal will utilize psychophysiological biomarkers of pain and peripheral vascular reactivity to test the effects of a laboratory- based hypnosis session on peripheral blood flow and acute pain and autonomic responses in adolescents with SCD and healthy controls, and examine how perceived SCD-related stigma may moderate acute pain responses. METHODS. A quasi-experimental, correlational design will be conducted. Three laboratory thermal heat pain tasks will be completed before and during a 30-minute hypnosis session. Peripheral blood flow, pain tolerance, threshold and intensity, heart rate variability, skin conductance response, and SCD- related stigma will be assessed. GOALS. To gain advanced training in laboratory-based methodology and physiological analyses to foster a deeper understanding of the potential mechanisms underlying the experience of pain in SCD, and ultimately conduct cutting-edge clinical research that examines the interface between physiological and psychological models of pain and emotion in vulnerable populations such as youth living with SCD ."
"9482136","Coinfection with HCV occurs in approximately 30% of HIV-positive persons. It has been well recognized that HIV infection accelerates liver fibrosis progression in the setting of HCV coinfection, although the precise mechanisms underlying this have not been fully elucidated. While great advances have been made in direct acting antiviral (DAA) therapy for HCV, HIV infection alone has increasingly been recognized as a cause of liver fibrosis. Liver disease remains the second most common cause of death in HIV-positive individuals in the active ART era. In addition, progressive hepatic fibrosis is often not recognized until cirrhosis and/or sequelae from its complications have supervened, long after DAAs can reverse the findings. This reality is further compounded by the lack of therapies that halt fibrosis progression. Uncovering the mechanisms underlying fibrosis progression and identifying new targets in HIV infected persons are therefore a high priority. YAP/TAZ are critical intermediates in the Hippo signaling pathway that regulate cell proliferation. In the Hippo ?on? state, YAP/TAZ are phosphorylated in the cytoplasm, leading to inactivation of YAP/TAZ and cell senescence or apoptosis. In the Hippo ?off? state, YAP/TAZ translocates to the nucleus and regulates cell proliferation and fibrogenesis. In addition, YAP/TAZ also respond to extracellular matrix (ECM) cues by sensing the density of the ECM to further augment fibrogenesis. Thus, YAP/TAZ nuclear localization has been induced by stiffer ECM, leading to hepatic stellate cell (HSC) activation and fibrogenesis, further aggravating fibrosis.  In earlier work, we demonstrated that HIV accentuates an HCV-driven profibrogenic program, mediated through reactive oxygen species, NF-?B and TGF?1, in both hepatocytes and HSCs. The YAP/TAZ pathway also converges with the TGF?1 pathway, as YAP/TAZ can also act as mechanoreceptors that regulate TGF?1 signaling via direct binding of YAP/TAZ to SMAD proteins, as a function of the stiffness of the ECM in human embryonic stem cells. The importance of the TGF?1 pathway in fibrosis progression in HIV/HCV coinfection suggests that YAP/TAZ plays a critical role in mediating liver disease progression in HIV. To this end, we have demonstrated that HIV can induce YAP/TAZ-regulated profibrogenic gene expression in HSCs, and HCV can do the same in hepatocytes. In addition, several targets upstream of YAP/TAZ are known to bind to HIV and its proteins, further implicating YAP/TAZ in liver disease pathogenesis in HIV. However, detailed studies regarding these associations are lacking. Given the overlap of YAP/TAZ with TGF?1, the mechanoregulatory function of YAP/TAZ, the importance of TGF?1 in HIV-related liver fibrosis, and the known upstream targets of YAP/TAZ that interact with HIV, we hypothesize that YAP/TAZ is pivotal to the pathogenesis of HIV-related liver fibrosis. We will address these relationships through the following Specific Aims: (1) define the contribution of YAP/TAZ pathway activation to hepatic fibrogenesis in the context of HCV and other liver diseases; (2) determine the mechanism(s) by which HIV induces YAP/TAZ activation with/without HCV; and (3) define the contribution of the extracellular matrix to HIV-mediated YAP/TAZ activation. By clarifying the relationship between HIV, HCV, YAP/TAZ, and TGF?, the studies in this proposal are likely to uncover new targets for antifibrotic agents."

"9467771","Project Summary/Abstract Toxin-antitoxin (TA) systems are important for the ability of many bacteria to respond to environmental stress. These systems typically consist of a stable toxin that inhibits cell growth and an antitoxin that binds and sequesters its cognate toxin. Degradation of the antitoxin can thus liberate the toxin, providing an important mechanism of bacterial growth regulation. TA systems are prevalent across nearly all bacterial species, with many species harboring many copies, often as a result of extensive gene duplication. Despite their abundance, however, there is evidence that toxin- antitoxin interactions are remarkably insulated from each other; i.e. only co-operonic toxins and antitoxins have high-affinity interactions. This suggests that new TA systems deriving from gene duplications must rapidly diverge from one another to ensure that each toxin-antitoxin pair has a unique interaction specificity. How this divergence occurs at the molecular level remains poorly understood, and is crucial to understanding the expansion and prevalence of TA systems in bacteria. Here, I propose to characterize the effect of gene duplications on toxin-antitoxin interactions through study of the VapBC family of TA systems in M. tuberculosis, which has undergone a massive expansion through successive gene/operon duplication events. I will first characterize the interactions between toxins and antitoxins from paralogous M. tuberculosis VapBC systems to determine whether these systems are fully insulated from one another. I will then identify the specific amino acid substitutions responsible for a divergence in binding specificity for paralogous VapBC systems. Finally, I will determine the evolutionary trajectory followed by two VapBC systems post-duplication through the resurrection and characterization of ancestral proteins as well as evolutionary intermediates. Because TA systems are crucial for many bacteria to adopt dormant, persister states in response to stress, understanding the large expansion of TA systems that took place in M. tuberculosis will help illuminate the molecular changes required for the evolution of pathogenicity in this species. Additionally, this work will shed important light on the general mechanisms governing the evolution of new protein-protein interactions."
"9389465","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Atopic dermatitis, asthma, and other allergic diseases pose an enormous socioeconomic burden in the United States and worldwide. Current treatment options for these illnesses are, however, limited in efficacy and lead to symptomatic relief in only subsets of patients. More broadly effective therapies against allergic diseases are desperately needed, yet achieving this imperative requires an advanced understanding of their pathogenic mechanisms and identification of new therapeutic targets. The protein kinase p38? is expressed in most mammalian cell types, and activated by a multitude of immunological signals such as microbial stimuli and cytokines. We have been studying the role of p38? in immunity and inflammation using mice with p38? gene deficiency in various cell types. These efforts led us to discover that p38? in skin epithelial cells played a crucial role in driving atopic dermatitis-like inflammation upon allergen challenge. p38? signaling was found to serve pro-allergic functions via promoting the expression of inflammatory mediators in epithelial cells. We identified the matrix metalloproteinase MMP13 as an epithelial enzyme whose expression was dependent on p38? signaling. Importantly, genetic ablation or pharmacological inhibition of MMP13 suppressed allergic skin and airway inflammation in mice. These findings and other preliminary data suggested the p38?-MMP13 axis as a promising therapeutic target for allergic diseases. In the proposed research, we will seek to validate the importance of the p38?-MMP13 axis in allergen-specific immune sensitization and allergic tissue inflammation. Further, we will perform biochemical analysis of cultured cells and recombinant proteins to establish the molecular pathways underlying p38?-dependent MMP13 expression and MMP13-mediated inflammatory responses. To achieve these goals, we will pursue the following specific aims: to determine the role of epithelial p38? signaling and MMP13 activity in mouse models of atopic dermatitis and asthma (Aim #1); to elucidate the mechanisms linking p38? signaling to MMP13 expression in skin and airway epithelial cells (Aim #2); and to identify the proteolytic targets of MMP13 that contribute to regulating allergic inflammation (Aim #3). The proposed research is expected to reveal the precise pathophysiological functions of p38? and MMP13 during allergic inflammation and the therapeutic potential of targeting the p38?-MMP13 axis in atopic dermatitis and asthma. The molecular mechanisms newly identified in our study will expand the sphere of knowledge about cell signaling in allergic disorders."
"9379416","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite advances in treatment, severe mental illness (SMI) remains common, chronic and difficult to treat. SMI is defined as having at least one mental disorder that lasts for 12-months and leads to substantial life interference. Sleep and circadian dysfunctions are among the most prominent correlates of SMI, yet have been minimally studied in ways that reflect the complexity of the sleep problems experienced by people with SMI. In SMI, sleep and circadian dysfunction undermines affect regulation, cognitive function and physical health, predicts onset and worsening of symptoms and is often chronic even with evidence-based SMI treatment. Prior treatment studies have been disorder-focused-they have treated a specific sleep problem (e.g., insomnia) in a specific diagnostic group (e.g., depression). However, real life sleep and circadian problems are not so neatly categorized, particularly in SMI where features of insomnia overlap with hypersomnia, delayed sleep phase and irregular sleep-wake schedules. Accordingly, we aim to test the hypothesis that a Trans diagnostic Intervention for Sleep and Circadian Dysfunction (TranS-C) will improve functional impairment, disorder- focused symptoms and sleep and circadian functioning. We will recruit participants across DSM diagnoses and across common sleep and circadian problems. The elements of TranS-C are efficacious across SMI in research settings with research-based providers. The next step is to test TranS-C in community settings with community-based providers. Accordingly, we propose to conduct an 'efficacy in the real world' randomized controlled trial within Alameda County Behavioral Health Care Services (ACBHCS), the CMHC for Alameda County. Alameda County is the most ethnically diverse county in the Bay Area. We will recruit 120 adults diagnosed with SMI and sleep and circadian dysfunction within ACBHCS. Individuals will be randomly allocated to TranS-C (n = 60) or 6-months of Usual Care followed by Delayed Treatment with TranS-C (UC- DT; n = 60). TranS-C is modularized and delivered across eight 50-minute, weekly, individual sessions. All participants will be assessed before, immediately following treatment and again 6 months later. Mediation analyses will examine whether improved sleep and circadian rhythm functioning mediate improvements in primary outcomes. Moderation analyses will examine if intervention efficacy is related to previously reported risk factors including demographics, symptom severity, medications, site, and season of treatment as well as psychiatric and medical comorbidity. This application is responsive to NIMH priorities focusing on implementing effective services in the community as well as treatments that are personalized, generalizable and not constrained by diagnostic criteria. RDoC is addressed by recruiting participants across diagnoses and defining sleep and circadian dysfunction broadly. The 'sleep-wake' and 'biological rhythms' constructs from the Arousal and Modulatory Systems domain are intervention targets and outcome measures. Our long-term objective is to establish the potential for widespread dissemination of TranS-C."
"9379836","PROJECT SUMMARY Accurate HIV incidence estimates are critical for monitoring the HIV/AIDS epidemic and evaluating interventions for HIV prevention. We have developed multi-assay algorithms (MAAs) that provide accurate incidence estimates. However, there are new challenges in this field of research. With increasing use of antiretroviral drugs for HIV treatment and prevention and a push towards early treatment initiation, more individuals, including those with recent infection, will be virally suppressed. This will impact cross-sectional incidence testing: higher rates of viral suppression will increase misclassification with standard serologic incidence assays; low viral load (VL) will no longer serve as biomarker for non-recent infection; and use of HIV diversity assays for incidence testing will be problematic, since it may not be possible to analyze samples with low VLs. Our hypothesis is that well-characterized samples, novel assays, and statistical modeling can be used to develop methods that provide accurate cross-sectional incidence estimates in the evolving landscape of HIV treatment and prevention. The Specific Aims of this project are: Aim 1: Expand a repository of well-characterized samples with information on the duration of HIV infection;  use these samples to evaluate performance of HIV incidence assays. Our repository includes >17,000  samples from individuals with known duration of infection. We will continue to expand this repository,  focusing on key populations and settings with high rates of viral suppression. These samples repository will  be used to evaluate serologic HIV incidence assays. Aim 2: Use massively multiplexed VirScan assay to identify serosignatures that discriminate between recent  and non-recent HIV infection. VirScan uses phage display, immuno-precipitation, and next generation  sequencing to measure antibody reactivity to >3,300 HIV peptides. We will test samples from Aim 1 with  VirScan and will use the data to identify ?serosignatures? that distinguish between recent and non-recent  infection, independent of VL. We will also use VirScan data to develop multi-peptide immunoassays (EIAs). Aim 3: Develop MAAs for HIV incidence estimation and validate the top-performing MAAs using independent sample sets from cohort studies and clinical trials with known HIV incidence. Data from Aims 1 and 2 will be  used to identify MAAs that maximize accuracy and minimize cost of cross-sectional incidence testing. The  performance of MAAs and VirScan-based EIAs will be validated by comparing incidence estimates obtained  with these methods to those observed in longitudinal follow-up in cohorts and clinical trials. Based on our prior work and preliminary data, we believe that these studies will identify accurate, cost- effective methods for cross-sectional HIV incidence estimation for use in diverse populations and settings. This work will have direct public health benefit, providing improved methods for surveillance of the HIV/AIDS epidemic, targeting prevention interventions, and design and evaluation of HIV prevention trials.

"9379440","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell (HSPC) represents a diverse population of cells responsible for maintaining and regenerating the hematopoietic system. Maintaining the proper function of these cells, and particularly the long-lived self-renewing hematopoietic stem cell, is essential for health and survival. In HIV disease there are serious deficits involving hematopoietic function that cannot simply be explained by HIV-1 infection of T-cells and macrophages. It has been hypothesized that HIV-1 can directly infect HSPC leading to hematopoietic dysfunction. This hypothesis is supported by studies showing that HSPC express the receptors necessary for HIV-1 infection and recent studies demonstrating direct infection of HSPC by HIV. It has also been demonstrated that HIV can establish a latent infection in HSPC, suggesting that HSPC could serve as an important reservoir for HIV-1 in drug treated individuals. However, the conclusions of these studies are disputed since they are based principally upon in vitro or ex vivo HIV-1 infection of HSPC. We propose to address the hypothesis that HSPC can be infected and function abrogated by using a model system, the BLT mouse model, which more closely mimics natural HIV-1 infection in the bone marrow (BM).  Investigation of HIV-1 infection of HSPC further requires the recognition that HSPC are not a uniform population. It has been known for decades that the majority of HSPC purified experimentally from bone marrow represent precursor cells that are destined to differentiate to specific lineages. Only a small fraction of these cells represent true hematopoietic stem cells which have the ability to self-renew indefinitely as well as give rise to the committed progenitor cells. In addition, our recent studies of HSPC in non-human primates demonstrate that even long-lived stem cells have different behaviors in regards to their contribution to hematopoietic output and their relative distribution to lymphoid versus myeloid progeny. Thus, it is critical that studies of HIV-1 infection of HSPC should investigate the consequences of infection upon individual HSPC rather than the entire population. This can be accomplished by a method known as clonal tracking, whereby individual HSPC are genetically marked by integrating lentiviral vectors and then tracked after transplant and repopulation. By combining clonal tracking with FACS separation of hematopoietic cell sub-populations, we can investigate the consequences of HIV infection on the behavior of HSPC clones and their progeny. We have used this methodology effectively to study the behavior of HSPC clones in non-human primates and propose to extend this methodology to the impact of HIV-1 infection upon HSPC."
"9388954","ABSTRACT The worsening epidemic of food allergy has been attributed to a confluence of environmental factors reflective of a modern life style, including altered gut microbiota, acting upon genetically susceptible individuals. Central to the development of food allergy is the breakdown of oral tolerance, normally enforced by food allergen- specific T regulatory (TR) cells. However, the mechanisms involved in the breakdown of oral tolerance are obscure. By employing an innovative murine model of human food allergy involving a gain of function mutation in the IL-4 receptor alpha chain immunotyrosine inhibitory motif (Il4raF709), we have demonstrated that food allergy is associated with reduced formation of allergen-specific induced TR (iTR) cells. Those iTR cells that are generated are dysfunctional and fail to prevent sensitization or to suppress active disease. This failure is related to their reprogramming into Th2-cell like TR cells that express IL-4, elevated levels of GATA3 and decreased Tgfb1 transcripts. We have also observed Th2 cell-like reprogramming in allergen-specific TR cells of human food allergic subjects. Food allergic Il4raF709 mice manifest dysregulation of innate lymphoid cells type 2 (ILC2s), which play a requisite role in disease pathogenesis by secreting IL-4. They also exhibit dysbiotic commensal flora that are pathogenic, as evidenced by their promotion of food allergy when transferred into germ-free (GF) mice. Reciprocally, flora of food tolerant mice prevented disease induction when transplanted into GF Il4raF709 mice. Therapy with minimal Clostridia or Bacteroidetes consortia protect against food allergy. Accordingly, in Aim 1, we propose that Th2 cell-like TR cells play a critical role in disease pathogenesis and persistence by directing IgE production and mast cell expansion, and that suppression of the Th2 cell-like TR cell program by TR cell-specific Il4/Il13 deletion rescues established disease. We will also examine the contribution of altered Tgfb1 expression in TR cells to disease pathogenesis in mice with TR cell- specific Tgfb1 deletion or transgene expression. In Aim 2, We will test the hypothesis that IL-4 production by ILC2 plays a crucial role in disease pathogenesis by suppressing iTR cell formation and inducing Th2 cell-like reprogramming of TR cells, and that TR cells in turn regulate ILC by IL-33-dependent mechanisms. Finally, in Aim 3, we hypothesize that a minimal set of Clostridia and Bacteroidetes consortia rescues active disease, suppresses dysbiosis and restores commensalism in part by signaling via MyD88 in TR cells, which would promote iTR cell formation and redirect intestinal immunoglobulin production away from IgE and towards IgA. Our proposed studies will identify fundamental immunological and microbial mechanisms by which oral tolerance is subverted in food allergy, and will enable the development of curative therapies."
"9394588","Objectives. Alcohol use disorder (AUD) and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) frequently co-occur, and having one condition worsens the course of the other. Individuals with both disorders exhibit worse functioning across a number of domains than individuals with either disorder alone. Prolonged exposure therapy (PE) is among the most effective treatments for PTSD. PE has been rated as a frontline treatment by multiple guidelines and reviews including the VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guidelines for the treatment of PTSD. However, in studies of individuals with PTSD and AUD, changes in alcohol use are only slightly better than in control or standard care conditions, reductions in PTSD symptoms are modest relative to studies of PE in PTSD patients without AUD, and rates of drop out from treatment are high. Combining PE with medication to curb drinking shows promise to improve upon the effectiveness of PE for individuals with comorbid AUD and PTSD, although thus far few studies have examined combining psychotherapy and medication. Topiramate is the single medication that has shown effectiveness for both AUD and PTSD and shows promise for reducing drinking among individuals with AUD and PTSD. However, the effect of adding topiramate to PE to treat comorbid AUD/PTSD has yet to be examined. The critical next step is to test a best practice PTSD treatment, PE, together with a promising pharmacological agent, topiramate, which has been found to be effective for both AUD and PTSD. Innovation: This application seeks to shift current clinical practice paradigms. A refinement to existing interventions is proposed through integration of two evidence based treatments.  Methodology. We propose to use a randomized, controlled, double blind study design to examine the effect of adding topiramate (TOP) to a best practice treatment for PTSD, PE. Participants will be 120 male and female Veterans from all services with AUD and PTSD. Our primary aims are to determine the relative efficacy of PE+topiramate, as compared to PE+placebo, in reducing problematic drinking, reducing PTSD symptoms, and improving functioning and quality of life among Veterans with comorbid AUD/PTSD at post-treatment and 3- and 6-month post-treatment follow-up. We will explore the extent to which decreases in drinking and PTSD symptoms lead to improvement in functioning.  The proposed study has the potential to improve functional and psychological recovery for a highly prevalent and highly impaired population of Veterans. This study will test a novel and innovative combination of psychotherapy and medication with the goal of improving the care of Veterans. The successful completion of this project will help change the practices that drive treatment for Veterans who have both AUD and PTSD. The fundamental rationale for this study is to improve the evidence base that informs how patients with AUD and PTSD can attain sustained recovery from both of these disorders. We will also explore whether changes in PTSD symptoms in the PE+TOP condition are partially explained by reductions in alcohol cravings. Norman - 1"
"9402544","?     DESCRIPTION:      Dementia affects over 7% of veterans age 65 and above seeking care through the Veteran's Health Administration (VHA), amounting to one out of every eleven veterans in some VISNs. The unique functional and behavioral impairments associated with Alzheimer's or a related dementia (ADRD) contribute substantially to psychological and physical morbidity of family caregivers and high rates of nursing home placement, with 60% of ADRD caregivers rating the emotional stress of caregiving as high or very high, and over one third reporting depressive symptoms. Although numerous evidence-based interventions have been developed to reduce caregiver burden and improve mental health and functional outcomes of the person with dementia, a recent systematic review noted almost none of these interventions make it off of the shelf to be readily available in clinical settings.           Care Consultation (CC) has emerged as a rare exception. CC is an evidence-based telephone intervention delivering psychoeducation, care coordination, and resource referrals in diverse areas such as safety and mental and behavioral health support. Yet CC's focus on coaching and support is inadequate for dyads experiencing high levels of distress. A stepped- intervention approach would address the VA's efficiency needs while allowing the flexibility for more resource-intensive additional counseling beyond the established CC framework when warranted by high dyad distress. This CDA-2 proposal would move such a dyadic intervention forward. Objectives: 1) Manualize the integration of care consultation and counseling components (i.e., the CC+C intervention). CC+C is guided by a rehabilitation recovery-based conceptual model to address the most common high distress targets (e.g., relationship distress, veteran or caregiver depression, anxiety, or pain) using patient-centered approaches. 2) Evaluate preliminary effectiveness and feasibility of the CC+C Intervention in a randomized controlled pilot study of distressed dyads to compare: a) the established CC intervention, to b) the CC+C intervention on veteran and caregiver outcomes. 3) Conduct exploratory analyses of the CC+C intervention on veteran long-term care placement at six and 12 months and examine two key treatment moderators (behavioral symptoms and spousal relationship status) that may impact intervention engagement and response to treatment.           Methods: Ten modules combining successful elements from existing manualized therapies and exercises developed by the investigative team during the CDA-1 period will be integrated with CC into a draft CC+C intervention manual. The manual will be finalized with input from the mentoring team and an Expert Advisory Panel for completeness, feasibility, and safety and risk considerations. Next 68 distressed veterans with dementia and their family caregivers will be recruited and randomized to either the CC+C intervention group or the CC comparison group. Patient, caregiver, and relationship outcomes (e.g., burden, depressive symptoms, anxiety, quality of life, relationship distress) will be measured at baseline, 6 months, and 12 months. Treatment implementation and feasibility data will be collected. Anticipated Impacts: The goal of this career development proposal is to acquire the knowledge, skills and experience necessary to successfully compete for an RR&D Merit Review Award evaluating a randomized controlled trial powered to establish efficacy and test effectiveness of the CC+C intervention. Rehabilitation- focused interventions that maximize functioning are essential for successful non-institutional VA dementia care in the future. Work completed during the CDA-2 period will serve as a foundation for a career committed to this goal. The impact of this work will be realized when an efficacious and highly-accessible rehabilitation intervention, such as the telephone-based dyadic intervention being piloted, becomes available for aging veterans and their families."
"9521182","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Somatosensory neurons project peripheral axons to the skin early in development to detect touch stimuli. Although the cutaneous terminals of these axons are often a proportionally small component of the total peripheral axon length, they are critical for function, since they are the sites where touch stimuli are first detected. Cutaneous axon endings are particularly vulnerable to damage by injury, diabetes, and inherited syndromes, notably Charcot-Marie-Tooth diseases. All of these conditions cause debilitating peripheral neuropathies characterized by chronic pain or the inability to sense touch. Characterizing how cutaneous sensory endings are formed, maintained, and respond to injury is thus essential for understanding these conditions and developing effective treatments. We have developed a larval zebrafish model to study the development of somatosensory peripheral axons and the skin cells that they innervate. Because zebrafish larvae are fertilized externally, develop rapidly, and are optically clear, the zebrafish somatosensory system offers unparalleled experimental access to the early stages of skin innervation. By contrast, studying these cutaneous sensory terminals in mammals is challenging, since they develop in utero and their complete three-dimensional structures are difficult to visualize. Most anatomical and molecular features of somatosensory axon territories in the skin are well conserved from fish to mammals, making zebrafish a relevant model for uncovering potential disease mechanisms. Our studies of the past few years have revealed that skin cells play several critical roles in the development, repair and function of somatosensory axon terminals in the skin. The goal of this proposal is to identify and characterize the molecular dialogues between axons and skin cells that regulate the establishment and maintenance of somatosensory axon territories. Using a unique and powerful set of molecular techniques and transgenic tools that we have developed in recent years, we will investigate three questions about the nature of axon/skin interactions during specific stages of somatosensory neuron ontogeny. First, how are sensory axons guided to the skin? Second, once in the skin how do axons become structurally associated with skin cells? And third, how does the skin respond to axon damage and contribute to repair? We will address these questions with a powerful combination of live imaging, embryology and molecular perturbations. Collectively, these studies will provide the first molecular insight into the regulation of several newly discovered functions of skin cells in the development and maintenance of the somatosensory system."
"9378785","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Hypoxia, DNA repair, and gene silencing.  Hypoxia is a key feature of solid tumors that confers radiation resistance, stimulates angiogenesis, promotes metastasis, and is linked to poor prognosis. With the support of this grant, we have shown that hypoxia is also a driver of genetic instability via down-regulation of critical DNA repair genes. In the past funding period, we have discovered that hypoxia can also induce durable silencing of the BRCA1 and MLH1 promoters via specific epigenetic factors. In recent preliminary studies, we have further determined that hypoxia can lead to silencing of the pro-apoptotic BIM gene and resistance to the EGFR inhibitor, gefitinib, in lung cancer cells. The broad, long-term goal of this renewal application is to elucidate the impact of hypoxic stress on carcinogenesis and cancer biology, with a focus on DNA repair and gene silencing.  In Aim 1, we will dissect the molecular mechanisms by which hypoxic stress drives epigenetic change to cause gene silencing, with a focus on the MLH1 promoter. We will determine promoter elements and regulatory factors that mediate silencing, and we will use a facile selection-based shRNA screen to identify key targets for reversal of this process. We will also assay for the impact of the hypoxic tumor microenvironment on gene silencing during tumor growth in vivo. Next, since heavy metals are known human carcinogens that can induce hypoxia-related pathways, in Aim 2 we will ask whether exposure to heavy metals can also drive gene silencing and/or down-regulate DNA repair. In Aim 3, we will build on novel preliminary results suggesting that growth of lung cancer cells in hypoxia can promote resistance to the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitor, gefitinib, in conjunction with silencing of the pro-apoptotic factor, BIM. We wil test specific hypotheses regarding the underlying mechanisms, and, guided by Aim 1, we will identify strategies to prevent or reverse this resistance.  The proposed work will elucidate key pathways of gene silencing and DNA repair regulation in response to hypoxia (and possibly to carcinogenic heavy metals) that may underlie critical steps in carcinogenesis, genetic instability, tumor progression, and resistance to radiation and other cancer therapies. Identification of strategies to prevent or reverse these pathways may provide the basis for new approaches to cancer prevention and therapy."
"9395741","7. PROJECT SUMMARY  This individual NRSA will provide mentored training in children?s environmental health for Kelsey Dzwilewski. Ms. Dzwilewski has completed coursework in neurotoxicology, developmental psychology, and statistics, and has initiated a research project assessing the effects of prenatal environmental exposures on neurodevelopment during infancy. This award would allow her to complete further coursework in epidemiology, and complete her thesis project under the guidance of an exceptional mentor team with expertise in neurotoxicology, environmental health, epidemiology, and biostatistics. The potential for adverse impacts of prenatal exposure to phthalates and bisphenol A (BPA) on neurodevelopment is a growing public health concern. Replacement chemicals such as bisphenol F (BPF) and bisphenol S (BPS) with similar chemical structures are being introduced; however, relatively little is known about their potential impacts on neurodevelopment. While previous studies have shown adverse impacts of prenatal exposures to phthalates and BPA on global measures of cognition, behavior, and social outcomes during childhood, results have varied across populations, sexes, and outcome measures. Furthermore, very few studies have assessed the impacts of these exposures on specific cognitive domains or measured neurodevelopmental outcomes early in life. This research will take place in the context of an ongoing prospective birth cohort study. Ms. Dzwilewski will use data she is collecting in the context of this study to assess the impacts of prenatal exposure to phthalates, BPA, and replacement chemicals on working memory, attention, and information processing speed at 7-8 months of age (Aim 1). The impact of exposures on face processing will also be assessed (Aim 2). This project will build on research illustrating that infant looking behaviors can be used as stable, reliable measures of basic cognitive processes. Moreover, the study will use infrared eye tracking to assess the impacts of phthalates and bisphenols on these specific domains in finer detail than has been possible with more traditional infant testing techniques. Looking behaviors will be assessed while infants view photographs of human faces and include novelty preference (a measure of working memory), average shift rate between simultaneously-presented stimuli (a measure attention), and average fixation duration (a measure information processing speed). The ratio of time spent looking at the eyes compared to other regions of the face will be used as a measure of face processing. Prenatal exposures will be measured via maternal urinary phthalate metabolites and total bisphenols in a pooled samples of urines collected across pregnancy, providing a stable estimate of exposure throughout the prenatal period. It is hypothesized that prenatal exposure to phthalates, BPA, and their replacements will be associated with adverse impacts on working memory, attention, information processing speed, and/or face processing. These findings will provide novel information regarding the impact of these ubiquitous environmental toxicants on neurodevelopment early in life."
"9384718","The linkage of Zika viral (ZIKV) infection to microcephaly and other severe neurological impairments pose a major threat to the global public health. Currently very little is known about how ZIKV causes neural damage, and what the risk is for ZIKV-infected pregnant women in terms of their babies with microcephaly or other defects. To begin filling these gaps, we need an effective and clinically relevant in vitro ZIKV infection model. The specific objective of this pilot project is to establish such in vitro model using native human fetal brain-derived neural stem cells (NSCs). We will use this system to examine both African and Asian lineages of ZIKV, and gain insight into mechanisms underlying ZIKV-mediated neural impairments. In general terms, our central hypothesis is that ZIKV infects and adversely affects human fetal brain NSCs and their differentiated neural cells. This project will be conducted through a collaboration of multiple investigators by combining our expertise in NSCs and ZIKV, and will pursue two specific aims: 1) To characterize ZIKV infection in human fetal brain NSCs and their differentiated progenies; and 2) To characterize ZIKV-mediated changes in human fetal brain NSCs. Aim 1 will determine whether various strains of ZIKV differ in their ability to infect human NSCs and their differentiated neural cells. Particularly, this study will include a strain of Asian lineage isolated from the mosquitoes in the current outbreak in Mexico, compared to the old African strain. Aim 2 will characterize the effects of ZIKV infection on NSC proliferation, survival and differentiation. This proof-of- concept study is expected to confirm the infectiveness of ZIKV in native human fetal brain-derived NSCs and their differentiated progenies. The establishment of an effective human fetal brain NSC-based in vitro system will facilitate our efforts to dissect pathological mechanisms underlying ZIKV neurotrophism at cellular and molecular levels, to predict the risk of ZIKV neuropathogenesis, and to test potential interventions to halt and/or reverse ZIKV-associated neural damages."
"9378694","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): As obligate intracellular pathogens, viruses require the host biosynthetic machinery. A fundamental requirement is the host translational machinery for the synthesis of new viral proteins. The mechanisms by which viruses co-opt the host translational machinery and avoid the innate host defenses that act to degrade viral mRNA and diminish cellular protein synthesis to prevent or lessen the synthesis of viral proteins are not understood. The goal of this project is to define mechanisms by which mammalian reoviruses reprogram the host translational machinery to preferentially synthesize viral proteins. In particular, the project will focus on virus-mediated compartmentalization of the translational machinery, a novel pathogenic mechanism by which viral protein synthesis can be maintained during infection-induced stress. The hypotheses to be tested are that reovirus promotes the translation of its viral mRNAs by: (1) compartmentalizing translation factors and ribosomal subunits within defined sites of viral replication in the cytosol called viral factories; (2) by sequestering the GADD34/protein phosphatase 1 complex that dephosphorylates eIF2? within viral factories, thus, protecting translation of viral mRNAs from stress-induced inhibition of protein synthesis; and (3) by directly modifying the ribosome and altering its function to promote translation of non-canonical viral mRNA. Three Aims are proposed: (1) To identify mechanism(s) by which the host cell translational machinery is compartmentalized within viral factories in reovirus-infected cells; (2) To determine whether activation of the integrated stress response and compartmentalization of cellular GADD34 and protein phosphatase 1 within reovirus factories promotes translation of reovirus mRNAs; and (3) To determine the role of the viral nonstructural protein ?NS in enhancing the translation of reovirus mRNA in infected cells. Expected outcomes of this work are identification of the viral factors required for compartmentalization of the host translational machinery within viral factories, an understanding of the mechanisms by which reoviruses replicate in the face of ongoing phosphorylated eIF2? and activation of the integrated stress response, and a greater understanding of the role of the reovirus protein ?NS in co-opting the host translational machinery and modifying ribosome function. We expect that an important outcome of this proposal will be new basic information regarding viral strategies to overcome innate host defenses."
"9403974","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Musculoskeletal diseases including fractures and osteoporosis are the second-greatest cause of disability worldwide. Unfortunately, our ability to treat or repair damaged bone is extremely limited. This contrasts sharply with human diseases of heterotopic ossification which clearly show that adult humans can form large amounts of bone, particularly after acute trauma. The innate immune system is a key mediator of injury responses and has critical functions in regulating fracture repair and anabolic responses to hormones. Innate immune cells such as macrophages are also important for the formation of heterotopic bone. In this proposal we use a genetic disease of heterotopic ossification, fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva (FOP), as a model to understand how the immune system affects post-natal bone formation. FOP is characterized by massive heterotopic ossification that can occur after injury. FOP is caused by a mutation in ACVR1 which increases receptor sensitivity to bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs), but the mechanisms that link injury to ossification are unclear. Our central hypothesis is that activation of the innate immune system can enhance the recruitment and differentiation of skeletal precursors in FOP. We previously created human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPS cells) from patients with FOP. These iPS cells showed increased chondrogenesis and mineral deposition. Our cultures also showed increased numbers of endothelial cells (ECs), which can adopt MSC-like properties when transfected with the FOP ACVR1 mutation. We also found that FOP iPS cell-derived endothelial cell progenitors (iECPs) expressed high levels of OSTERIX, RUNX2, and SOX9, three master regulators of bone formation. We will pursue three aims to determine how the innate immune system is affected by ACVR1 activity in FOP. In Aim 1, we will create a new set of iPS cell lines marked with an OSX/SP7-mCherry reporter to detect osteoprogenitors. We will then test if FOP iECPs exposed to inflammatory cues form more osteogenic precursors than control lines. In Aim 2, we will test if FOP iECP cells are chemotactic to candidate cytokines we identified in our preliminary experiments, and if FOP iPS cell derived macrophages to respond abnormally to activation triggers. Finally, in Aim 3, we will test if macrophage-specific activation of ACVR1 by the Q207D mutation is sufficient to initiate heterotopic ossification after injury in vivo. Togethe, our studies use newly-developed techniques to understand how the BMP signaling pathway activated by ACVR1 leads to heterotopic ossification. The tools and findings are directly applicable to FOP and can also be used to study diseases in and out of the skeleton. Finally, understanding how the immune system can enhance skeletal growth will be useful for treating diseases of bone loss, preventing abnormal bone gain, and improving allograft survival and function."
"9468547","Herpesviruses, such as herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1), rely on the ability to egress, in a process termed budding, where progeny virions are released from the cell and spread to uninfected tissues and hosts. HSV-1 causes lifelong infections of the host resulting in diseases such as blindness, encephalitis, keratitis, and cancers and currently there is no cure or vaccine. High rates of new infections, and reactivation of latent infections, stem from the ability of the virus to egress. Although egress is not unique to herpesviruses, unusually, herpesviruses bud twice, rather than only once as found for most other viruses. Specifically, herpesviruses first bud at the inner nuclear membrane (INM) where viral capsids form nascent buds that pinch off into the perinuclear space (scission). These buds then fuse with the outer nuclear membrane releasing capsids into the cytosol. Capsids subsequently bud again at the cytoplasmic membranes derived from early endosomes or the trans-Golgi network. The first HSV-1 egress event, nuclear budding, relies on the conserved nuclear egress complex (NEC), a heterodimer composed of two viral proteins, UL31 and UL34, both necessary for the exit of viral capsids from the nucleus. A major barrier in the understanding of how this complex mediates budding is the lack of knowledge regarding the conformational changes the NEC undergoes to achieve budding, how the complex interacts with membranes, and how this process is regulated during viral infection. A deep knowledge of the mechanism of NEC budding may hold the key to curing this disease by blocking the spread of future infections. Therefore, this proposal is based on the central hypothesis that NEC- mediated budding is a dynamic, complex process that is regulated by multiple factors during infection, including the NEC itself. Three specific aims underpinned by this central hypothesis form a multipronged approach combining several biophysical techniques to address the significant gaps in our knowledge regarding the NEC budding mechanism. First, the effects on NEC lattice formation of both non-budding NEC mutants and an NEC mutant that restores budding in non-budding mutants will be investigated with cryoelectron microscopy/tomography (cryoEM/T) to analyze NEC conformational changes. A comparison of these lattices to the wild-type NEC lattice will provide details as to how specific residues contribute to NEC lattice formation and enable budding. Secondly, the role of membrane-interacting regions of the NEC will be probed using mutagenesis, confocal microscopy budding quantification, and cryoET. Finally, the regulation of NEC budding will be investigated by determining how another HSV-1 protein binds to the NEC and how this binding has an effect on NEC budding efficiency utilizing small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), mutagenesis, and cryoET. All together, these experiments will add to the understanding of nuclear budding in general and ultimately aid in the development of novel therapeutic agents to prevent the spread of future HSV-1 infections."
"9379393","Abstract. Immune tolerance expands to accommodate foreign paternal antigens expressed by the developing fetus during pregnancy. This vital process requires sustained expansion of a dedicated immune suppressive maternal CD4+ T cell subset, called regulatory T cells (Tregs), whereas blunted maternal Treg accumulation occurs in spontaneous abortion, preeclampsia and other pregnancy complications linked with fractured fetal tolerance. This necessity for maternal Tregs is reinforced in animals where even partial transient depletion from expanded pregnancy levels disrupts fetal tolerance and triggers fetal wastage. One important, but relatively uncharacterized feature of Tregs lies in their antigen specificity. Like other T cells, individual Tregs have defined specificity, and T cell receptor stimulation is required for activating their suppressive properties. By combining tetramer enrichment for tracking rare CD4+ T cells based on defined specificity and the use of transgenic mice that ubiquitously express defined model antigens to sire pregnancy in non-transgenic females that transforms model antigens into surrogate fetal antigens, our initial studies show pregnancy primes robust expansion of maternal Tregs with fetal specificity. By extending this analysis after parturition, maintenance of maternal Tregs with pre-existing fetal specificity, and their more robust re-accumulation with fetal-antigen re- stimulation in subsequent pregnancies were also revealed. In turn, sharply increased resiliency against fetal wastage during secondary compared with primary pregnancy coincides with this expanded pool of fetal- specific memory Tregs. These results highlighting potential protective memory features for maternal Tregs are in agreement, and may provide a scientific basis to explain human partner-specific protective benefits of prior successful pregnancy against complications in subsequent pregnancies. Nonetheless, despite this association, what remains unknown is whether fetal-specific memory Tregs confer protection against fetal wastage. Addressing these critical gaps in knowledge require new strategies for in vivo manipulation of maternal Tregs with defined fetal specificity. Our overall hypothesis is that maintenance of maternal memory Tregs requires ongoing stimulation by fetal cells that establish microchimerism in mothers after pregnancy. In turn, depletion of microchimeric fetal cells allows the necessity of memory Tregs in protection against fetal wastage during later pregnancies to be investigated. Furthermore, if postpartum maintenance of regulatory tolerance is restricted to antigens expressed by microchimeric fetal cells, the transient pregnancy-induced remission and swift postpartum recurrence of organ-specific autoimmune disorders (e.g. multiple sclerosis) may reflect inadequate expression of tissue restricted self antigens by fetal microchimeric cells. Therefore, accomplishing these aims are of exceptionally high significance for unraveling the fundamental biology of Treg with regards to memory and antigen-specificity, as well as establishing the scientific framework to explain epidemiological features of human pregnancy complications and shifts in autoimmune disease severity after parturition."
"9349688","Specific Aims:  1) To determine the effect of FOBT screening on colorectal cancer mortality, non-colorectal cancer and all-cause mortality by age (by 5 year age groups) and gender in the three fecal occult blood testing trials updated to 30 years of follow-up  2) To determine the overall effect of fecal occult blood testing (FOBT) screening on colorectal cancer mortality, non-colorectal cancer and all-cause mortality in the three fecal occult blood testing trials updated to 30 years of follow-up Background: Current guidelines for colorectal cancer screening recommend starting screening at age 50 for average-risk individuals with fecal occult blood testing (FOBT) or fecal immunochemical testing (FIT), FOBT/FIT+ flexible sigmoidoscopy, or colonoscopy, without specifying an age at which to stop offering screening. There have been three randomized controlled trials of screening using FOBT that showed a reduction in colorectal cancer mortality. Updating results from the FOBT trial in the US, we have recently reported that screening may not reduce all-cause mortality, and that benefit of screening may differ for men and women of different ages. In our study, women <60 did not benefit from screening for colorectal cancer. However, we were limited in our analyses by small size of the groups and low event rates. To improve our understanding of these findings, and inform guidelines, the effect of screening on colorectal cancer mortality and all cause mortality in various age and gender groups need to be examined in a larger sample. Project Design and methods: This project involves updating the vital status and cause of death of all participants from UK and Danish fecal occult blood testing trials and pool the data with the Minnesota Colon Cancer Control Study up to 30 years of follow-up and calculating CRC, non-CRC and all-cause mortality estimates. We plan to compare colorectal cancer (CRC) mortality and non-colorectal cancer mortality rates between the screened and unscreened groups, by age categories at time of randomization of 5 year (50-54, 55-59, 60-64, 65-69, 70-74, 75-80) and 10 year (50-59, 60-69, 70-80) intervals. We will also stratify the above analyses by gender subgroups."
"9379856","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Exposure to environmental toxins can elicit epigenetic changes with the long-term effect to modulate transcription, leading to long-lasting effects that alter disease susceptibility, drug efficacy, and even the rate of aging. The mechanisms by which environmental conditions are translated into changes in the epigenetic landscape are poorly understood. The investigators have discovered a new epigenetic transcriptional memory in response to H2S exposure in C. elegans. H2S is a common environmental toxin, and is the second most common cause of occupational deaths from inhaled gas, behind only carbon monoxide. In this research project, the investigators will leverage the power of C. elegans genetics to test the hypothesis that environmental toxins such as H2S alter the epigenetic landscape. They will measure transcriptional responses associated with specific H2S exposures that have differential phenotypic effects, and will delineate how epigenetic effects associated with the response to H2S alters transcriptional response to subsequent toxin exposure. Their preliminary data show that the conserved ATP- dependent chromatin-remodeling enzyme SWI/SNF is required for the long-lasting memory of H2S. The investigators will measure the genomic localization of SWI/SNF components and determine when and where the complex is required to test the hypothesis that chromatin remodeling underlies the transcriptional memory of H2S. Finally, the investigators have isolated new mutations that disrupt the normal epigenetic response to H2S. They will use the power of C. elegans molecular and genetic biology to identify the genes and pathways that mediate the long- lasting effects of H2S exposure. Together, these studies will reveal fundamental features of how cellular responses integrate with epigenetic factors to coordinate long-term effects of environmental stimuli in animals. Moreover, this research project will facilitate career enhancement and mentoring that will fully integrate the Principal Investigator's lab with the excellent environmental health science community at the University of Washington."
"9403850","Partnering with Women with Disabilities to Develop a Health Information Website Women with disabilities are living longer with better quality of life as a result of advances in medical science, pharmacology, and technology. For those with access to those resources, the risks of morbidity and mortality have been significantly reduced. The problem is bringing this life- saving knowledge, particularly about women?s health, beyond academic medical centers to the clinics and homes of the women and their families. This project will partner closely with consumers, clinicians, researchers, and librarians in every phase of the development of an easily accessible, understandable, and usable online information resource on women's health in the context of disability, test its usability in an iterative process, and produce a user training program. For the past 25 years, the Center for Research on Women with Disabilities (CROWD) has documented disparities in health and access to healthcare experienced by the growing and seriously underserved population of women with disabilities; however, information is fragmented and there is little evidence that discoveries are benefiting the intended audience nationwide. For example, although more women with significant physical impairments are becoming pregnant, they continue to struggle with finding accessible healthcare facilities and providers who are knowledgeable and experienced in the effect of disability on pregnancy and delivery. While the long-term effects of pregnancy on pelvic health is a topic of growing interest to the aging population of women and gynecologists, the literature is almost completely silent on the pelvic health of women with disabilities. Postings on the CROWD website about current knowledge need to be expanded and converted into a fully interactive, searchable information resource, and its availability should be made known widely. The goal of this project is to improve the reproductive and pelvic health of women with disabilities. In partnership with the University of Montana, Texas Medical Center Library and a Community Advisory Board, and with review by clinicians and researchers, this project will create a health information website that is fully interactive and searchable by women with disabilities. The purpose of this website is to employ common information technology to empower women with disabilities to become self-informed about decisions related to health. Focus groups and a national survey of 500 women with physical disabilities will identify their information needs and use of digital technologies. Comprehensive literature reviews of reproductive health, pelvic health, breast health, and access to health care for women with disabilities will provide information to populate the website and produce downloadable topical summaries with links to other information resources. Second will be the development of a tailored training program for women with physical disabilities on how to use this website, with feasibility testing using face-to-face and online formats with 30 local women. This health information website and accompanying training program will promote health literacy, improve reproductive and pelvic health outcomes among women with disabilities, and reduce health disparities."
"9379800","DESCRIPTION:      Objective: Fibrous tissues of the musculoskeletal system are plagued by their poor intrinsic healing capacity. In this proposal, we focus on the knee meniscus, a tissue critical for proper load transfer, and for which current repair strategies do not restore function. To address this clinical need, we have devised a novel strategy employing anisotropic biodegradable composite nanofibrous scaffolds that serve as an inter- positional device and enhance meniscus repair. The objective of this study is to develop nanofibrous scaffolds capable of releasing multiple agents over different temporal scales, and thus, positively impact the entire healing process. Research Design: This proposal will utilize a novel class of composite nanofibrous scaffolds (developed during the first funding cycle) that have varying degradation profiles and release kinetics of bioactive agents targeted to different phases of healing and repair. These release profiles will be tuned to first 'enable' repair by rapidly and locally degrading the dense extracellular matrix at the injury site to allow cell migration and new tissue formation. Second, these scaffolds will selectively recruit progenitor cells to the wound interface, to accelerate and  sustain the repair process. Finally, the scaffold will provide biochemical factors over a longer-term to 'direct' cell phenotype and promote matrix production. The synergistic interactions of these different adjuvants to repair will be investigated in a large animal meniscus defect model. Methodology: We will develop and characterize composite nanofibrous scaffold systems that permit release of factors from the fibers themselves or from encapsulated microspheres. This novel scaffolding technology allows for the inclusion of several fiber populations with different degradation profiles and for the release of multiple bioactive factors with varying temporal release profiles. Scaffolds will be utilized in a model of meniscus repair in adult sheep and compared to suture repair controls at early (2, 4, and 8 weeks) and longer term (16 and 48 week) time points. Evaluation criteria will include meniscus and cartilage histology, micro-computed tomography, and mechanical properties. Findings: We will develop composite nanofiber-based engineered scaffolds to enhance meniscus repair in an ovine model. We will show enhanced cellularity and integration with local matrix degradation at the injury site. We will  also show increased recruitment of progenitor cells as well as improved matrix production with staged biofactor delivery. The synergistic effects of these treatments will be assessed relative to  the current standard of care. Clinical Relationships: If successful, these studies and new technologies will set the stage for clinical translation and treatment of human meniscal pathology. These novel scaffolds can be directly utilized in clinical procedures to enhance meniscus repair. Impact/Significance: The proposed research is highly relevant to the mission of the Veterans Health Administration since it will advance the health of veterans suffering from meniscus injuries resulting from military trauma, injury or from degenerative diseases. If successful, the proposed therapy will improve the quality of life of such individuals."
"9394212","Project Summary Proper blood cell formation by rare, self-renewing hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) in the bone marrow (BM) results from a complex series of fate decisions that are controlled via an array of genetic, epigenetic and metabolic programs. Notably, mutations in genes regulating these programs often lead to HSC dysfunction and/or the development of hematological malignancies. Recently, somatic mutations in pre-RNA splicing factors such as U2AF1 have been observed in hematopoietic cells of patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), a heterogeneous and difficult-to-treat clonal blood disorder characterized by cytopenias in one or more blood lineages and the potential to evolve into acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). Notably, U2AF1 mutations are considered early events in MDS pathogenesis, suggesting that aberrant pre-RNA splicing in HSCs drives the evolution to disease by deregulating HSC fate. However, the role of U2AF1 in regulating HSC function in normal hematopoiesis, and the contribution of mutant U2AF1 to disease is unclear. Emerging evidence suggests that MDS, AML and other hematological malignancies are associated with prior or concurrent onset of chronic inflammatory diseases including rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, and obesity, and indeed MDS itself is typically characterized by overproduction of inflammatory cytokines and hyperactive innate immune signaling. Moreover, inflammatory signals such as interleukin-1 (IL-1) can directly impact HSC fate, leading to overproduction of myeloid cells at the expense of self-renewal and balanced lineage output. Strikingly, U2AF1 has been shown to play an important role in regulating cellular responses to inflammation by generating anti-inflammatory splice forms of key immune signaling genes such as MyD88. Thus, we hypothesize that U2AF1 plays a critical role in regulating HSC responses to inflammatory signals, with aberrant splicing leading to hyperactive responses to inflammatory signals, resulting in a positive feedback loop that promotes deregulated blood production and altered HSC self-renewal. We propose that aberrant mRNA splicing and inflammation are therefore mechanistically linked and are crucial drivers of hematopoietic dysfunction and, potentially, evolution to MDS and other blood disorders. This proposal seeks to identify how pre-RNA splicing, and U2AF1 in particular, regulates the self-renewal and differentiation of HSCs in the context of inflammation using a combination of in vitro assays and in vivo mouse models of chronic inflammation using WT and U2AF1S34F transgenic mice. These investigations will fill a significant gap in our understanding of how aberrant splicing promote hematopoietic dysfunction and eventual progression to malignancy, by investigating whether aberrant splicing in U2AF1 mutant HSCs exacerbates their response to inflammatory signaling. Collectively, they will provide needed insight into the role of U2AF1 in regulating HSC responses to inflammation and stand to identify a previously unexplored link between aberrant pre-RNA splicing, chronic inflammation, and the pathogenesis of complex blood disorders such as MDS."
"9586345","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Bacterial drug resistance and HIV continue to threaten control of tuberculosis, a communicable disease responsible for well over one million deaths annually [41]. However, after decades of stasis, recent investment in tuberculosis basic science research has resulted in the emergence of new drugs and diagnostics. Critical challenges and opportunities lie in translating recent research advances and new tools into tuberculosis public health practice; historically the tuberculosis field has been vexingly slow in this regard. Pragmatic clinical trials are a promising mechanism to address this challenge [3]. Specifically, pragmatic trials will help to understand the effectiveness of new interventions under usual-care conditions, and to disseminate to practitioners and programs experience with those interventions. Pragmatic clinical trials may be particularly well-suited to tuberculosis, in which centralized clinical data collection and outcome reporting are programmatic norms - this is analogous to how electronic medical record systems are facilitating conduct of pragmatic trials in diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and other health fields. While the idea of pragmatic trials in tuberculosis is not entirely new, to date there has been no focused, systematic exploration of the design of tuberculosis pragmatic trials, regulatory facets of tuberculosis pragmatic trials, an strategies for pragmatic trial implementation across a variety of settings and research questions. The career development goal of this K24 proposal is to expand my knowledge of pragmatic trials, to systematically explore facets of the design and implementation of tuberculosis pragmatic trials, and to design and obtain funding for one or more large pragmatic trials in tuberculosis treatment or diagnosis.        Our team's patient-oriented tuberculosis research, which will be the context for mentoring under this K24, is focused on explanatory clinical trials of tuberculosis therapeutics and diagnostics - that is, whether new drugs and tests work under ideal conditions. Much of this work is done in the context of research consortia in which I have leadership roles. I serve as a PI of the NIH/NIAID Tuberculosis Clinical Diagnostics Research Consortium (TB-CDRC), and lead phase 2 and phase 3 therapeutics trials within the CDC Tuberculosis Trials Consortium (TBTC). Our work in these consortia has been at the vanguard of implementation of highly quality monitored, strictly implemented clinical studies (including laboratory components) intended to produce results with the highest possible internal validity. A detailed understanding of tuberculosis clinical trials, along with knowledge and experience in tuberculosis public health program work, provides a very strong foundation from which to undertake new research into pragmatic trials aimed at understanding external validity (generalizability) of new tuberculosis interventions.         With respect to mentoring, there is unprecedented opportunity arising from the surge in interest among young health professionals in careers in tuberculosis, HIV, and global health. I have a strong track record in mentoring, including having mentored one infectious disease physician through a successful NIH K23 project and on to independent R01 funding. K24 funding will provide protected time for expansion of mentoring activities.         This K24 proposal lies at the nexus of the needs and opportunities for translating tuberculosis research into practice and for training the next generation of investigators in patient-oriented research in tuberculosis. The specific aims are:        Aim 1: To directly mentor junior investigators in patient-oriented research in tuberculosis. Mentorship will be principally in the context of research consortia in which I have leadership roles (NIH Tuberculosis Clinical Diagnostics Research Consortium and CDC Tuberculosis Trials Consortium). Junior investigators will be mentored as they take on roles within main consortium studies and/or lead smaller add-on projects that leverage ongoing consortium activities.        Aim 2: To develop and implement a model for mentoring within clinical research consortia. Initial work will focus on developing and implementing a mentoring program within the Tuberculosis Clinical Diagnostics Research Consortium and Tuberculosis Trials Consortium. A toolkit will be developed, and then used to expand the model to other clinical research consortia, for example the CDC Tuberculosis Epidemiologic Studies Consortium and the NIH AIDS Clinical Trials Consortium.        Aim 3: To build my skills and knowledge in the conduct of pragmatic trials in tuberculosis, in order to conduct future pragmatic trials to assess whether and which new tuberculosis treatments and/or diagnostics work in routine practice. This will be accomplished through interaction with experts in the field of pragmatic trials (Prof. Andrew Nunn and Dr. Jeremy Sugarman), coursework undertaken at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, engagement in the NIH Health Care Systems Research Collaboratory, and interviews with key stakeholders in the tuberculosis field."
"9385290","Abstract A major goal of HIV-1 vaccine research is the design of immunogens capable of inducing broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) that bind to the viral envelope glycoprotein (Env). While many HIV bnAbs have been isolated from chronically infected patients, raising bnAbs by immunization has been difficult. The principal problems appear to be (1) that bnAb epitopes are sub-dominant and so the response must be primed and boosted in such a way as to avoid off-target responses and favor the desired specificities, (2) that most forms of Env bind poorly to unmutated precursors of bnAbs so that bnAb responses are not typically primed appropriately and (3) we do not understand how best to boost responses once primed to yield bnAbs that typically have an unusual amount of somatic mutation. In this proposal, we address these problems by study of engineered immunogens in bnAb knockin mice. We focus on two classes of bnAbs, VRC01 and PGT130, which we predict will be readily raised by vaccination in humans using appropriately engineered immunogens. VRC01 is the prototype bnAb of a class that recognizes the CD4 binding site (CD4bs) and PGT130 is a representative of a class of glycan-dependent bnAbs that bind the V3 loop and mannose patch on Env. Both antibody classes have been described in many HIV infected individuals and are particularly potent and broad suggesting that a vaccine able to elicit such Abs would provide protection at relatively low Ab concentrations. We have previously generated mice engineered to carry B cells with germline reverted (gl)-VRC01 immunoglobulin heavy (H) and light (L)-chains, and here we propose to generated new knock-in mice carrying gl-PGT130 H- and L-chain genes. The mice express the B cell receptors that should be triggered and matured to generate VRC01 or PGT130 class bnAbs and will be used to investigate immunogens and immunization strategies. For priming, we will use existing germline-targeting immunogens reactive to gl-VRC01 and we will generate novel engineered immunogens targeting gl- PGT130 and. For boosting we will test a range of engineered and natural immunogens to focus and enhance intermediate and final steps in bnAb maturation. This study will test the generality of our germline-targeting approach, discover new vaccine candidates, and teach us lessons on how to maximize subdominant anti-viral responses that should inform human vaccination strategies in general."
"9390032","PROJECT SUMMARY Humans have a profound, double-edged relationship with poxviruses. On one hand, the devastating effects of smallpox are unparalleled by any other pathogen in recorded history, and its eradication is a milestone in modern medicine. On the other, poxviruses are now used as highly effective gene therapy and vaccine vectors as well as oncolytics in the treatment of cancer. Moreover, molluscum contagiosum is widespread and causes prolonged, untreatable lesions, while emerging poxviruses are a serious concern. Indeed, smallpox evolved from a rodent Taterapox virus and zoonotic poxvirus infections resulting in human-to-human transmission are being reported at an increasing frequency. In some cases smallpox vaccination does not provide protection, while live smallpox vaccines such as Vaccinia Virus (VacV) pose serious, life-threatening complications for many individuals. As such, whether it be infection by existing or future poxviruses, zoonotic infections or complications from therapeutic vectors, it is important to understand how these unusual pathogens replicate. Unlike most other double-stranded DNA viruses, poxviruses replicate in the cytoplasm of infected cells within viral factories (VFs). Encoding >200 genes that include their own polymerases, transcription factors and redox system, poxviruses exhibit remarkable self-sufficiency. Despite this, poxviruses remain absolutely dependent on gaining access to host ribosomes in order to synthesize viral proteins, representing an exploitable weakness. Indeed, we have shown previously that VacV activates the host cap-dependent translation machinery and that this can be targeted using small molecules to suppress virus replication without cytotoxicity. Our preliminary data identifies a series of new and unexpected modifications induced by VacV. This includes a viral protein that remodels mammalian Target of Rapamycin (mTOR), a key regulator of ribosome recruitment and host immune responses, displacing regulatory subunits to render mTOR constitutively active and beyond host control. In addition, mass spectrometry and dual-color live cell imaging revealed that VacV phosphorylates the small ribosomal subunit, RACK1 at unique sites not induced by other viruses or stimuli, and recruits RACK1 to VFs as they form. Moreover, we find that this modification is required for selective synthesis of late VacV proteins, but not proteins of other viruses, and is induced by a VacV kinase. Finally, proteomic analysis of ribosome complexes isolated from primary human cells further revealed that VacV induces highly selective modifications to other ribosomal proteins and to the subunit composition of ribosomes themselves. Our data suggests that this ?ribosome specialization? is important for poxvirus protein synthesis, and is dispensable to the host. Understanding how these modifications facilitate VacV protein synthesis will provide important insights into fundamental aspects of poxvirus biology as well as mechanisms of selective mRNA translation. In addition, identifying factors involved in selective viral versus host protein synthesis has the potential to uncover new therapeutic targets and approaches to combat poxvirus infection."
"9383022","The diarrheal disease cholera poses enormous health, economic, and political burdens worldwide. The causative agent of cholera, Vibrio cholerae, is endemic in aquatic habitats, but it is capable of infecting the human small intestine, causing a massive, life-threatening diarrheal response. To colonize the host and cause disease, V. cholerae must acquire essential nutrients, including iron, in the host environment. The predominant form of iron present in the small intestine is ferrous iron. Thus, it is critical to understand the mechanisms of ferrous iron uptake in V. cholerae. The major ferrous iron transporter in V. cholerae is Feo. The Feo system is widely distributed among all bacterial species, and has important functions in the virulence of several pathogenic species; nevertheless, very little is known about its structure and mechanism of transport. In V. cholerae, the Feo transporter is composed of three proteins, FeoA, FeoB, and FeoC. The membrane-embedded C-terminal domain of FeoB is likely to form the pore for iron transport, and, interestingly, its N-terminal domain has homology to small eukaryotic G proteins, suggesting a novel mechanism of transport. The roles of FeoA and FeoC are unknown. We recently demonstrated that the three Feo proteins associate to form a higher order complex in vivo. This represents the first structural analysis of the mature, membrane- embedded, active Feo complex in vivo. The goal of this proposal is to determine the overall structure of this large complex in order to build and test models for the mechanism of iron transport. In our first specific aim, we will determine the mass and stoichiometry of the native Feo complex. This will lay the groundwork for a structural model of the active Feo transporter. In aim 2, we will refine this model by delineating the sites of interaction within and between the members of the complex. We will then test the functional significance of these interactions for complex formation and iron transport activity. In aim 3, we will determine the source of energy for transport through Feo. These studies will significantly advance our knowledge of the structure and function of this important and unique iron transporter. Significantly, all our studies will be carried out using active, membrane-associated Feo complexes in vivo, giving our results an undeniable relevance over the in vitro studies that currently dominate the Feo field. As our previous work shows, V. cholerae is an ideal model organism for the study of Feo. We have already assembled most of the strains and reagents needed, and we, and our collaborators, have the expertise required to carry out the proposed experiments."
"9379837","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This research proposal looks at the importance of viral diversity on transmission and evolution. Viruses exist not as clonal populations but as 'swarms' of variants with mutations along the genome. Variation has not been characterised in arboviruses (arthropod-borne viruses), which require infection of a vertebrate host and a vector (such as a mosquito or tick). During infection of the mosquito there are several anatomical barriers that reduce the number of viral particles, thus a bottleneck is imposed on the virus. It i hypothesised that, upon infection of the mosquito vector, the amount of variation decreases, leading to a decreased rate of evolution in the arboviruses as compared to viruses with a single host. The rate of evolution is important to understand viral ecology and emergence. Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV) and two natural mosquito vectors will be used to model viral variation present in wild-type transmission, and the impact that mosquito infection has on viral diversity. VEEV is of interest because it is both an important, naturally emerging virus and a potential bioweapon with no licensed vaccine or therapy. The virus circulates in Mexico and has caused outbreaks in equids and humans in the U.S. Viral diversity will be investigated using 3 specific aims. First, the bottleneck profile of the epidemic vector Psorophora confinnis will be determined compared to the bottleneck profile already determined for the enzootic vector Culex taeniopus. Secondly, the profile of intra-host variation of VEEV subtypes IE and IC will be determined upon infection of the mosquito vectors C. taeniopus and Aedes taeniorhynchus and an appropriate rodent host, individually and as part of a transmission cycle. The effect of the anatomical mosquito bottlenecks on viral diversity will be investigated using an established protocol to initiate a laboratory transmission cycle that approximates to that occurring naturally. The levels of diversity will be determined using Next Generation Sequencing technology to determine the minority populations present throughout the transmission cycle. This decrease in diversity may lead to a reduction in fitness due to stochastic effects. The level of drift caused b this decrease in diversity will be tested via an experimental transmission cycle. Thirdly, the change in the ability of the virus to complete a transmission cycle when the polymerase fidelity is increased by genetic manipulation will be examined. It is hypothesized that viral variation aids in viral survival therefore viruses mutated to exhibit high-fidelity in their replication will be ued in experimental infections. It is expected that viral survival will decrease. The results of this projct will enhance our understanding of arboviral population genetic dynamics occurring in the mosquito vector as well as determine the degree to which natural selection and genetic drift influence the persistence and emergence of new arboviruses. The results will translate to other emerging arboviruses such as dengue, West Nile and chikungunya, as well as provide the data to generate effective models of arbovirus emergence."
"9390770","Hospital-acquired bacterial diseases represent a huge block in attempting to care for patients being treated for unrelated medical problems. Of particular concern are multidrug resistant (MDR) pathogens in hospital settings. Acinetobacter baumannii is one such pathogen that has become exceedingly difficult to treat, with the organism having evolved resistance to most commonly used antibiotics during its residence in hospitals. Fluoroquinolones (FQ), which target DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV, are chief among the antibiotics that have lost usefulness with this organism. The most common resistant A. baumannii strains in hospitals contain three genetic changes, two of which interfere with target binding to FQ, while the third results in overproduction of one of two antibiotic egress pumps. This proposal is directed toward developing new strategies for eliminating fluoroquinolone-resistant (FQR) strains. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that FQR creates points of vulnerability for the organism, and drug targets can be identified that take advantage of this potential Achilles' heel. The proposal seeks to identify drug targets in FQR strains by mapping genetic interactions that protect against stresses caused by the acquired resistance mutations.  The proposed studies focus on performing mutant hunts to identify proteins that are required for the survival of FQR bacteria or which, when inactivated, restore the therapeutic usefulness of FQs. The overall strategy involves setting up a bank of parent strains with various combinations of mutations that individually contribute to FQR. Each of these strains is subjected to high-density insertion mutagenesis followed by pooling and analysis by massively parallel sequencing. The fitness of insertions in the FQR backgrounds will be compared to the FQS parent, allowing identification of genes required for viability of each of the strains. Of particular interest in this regard are strains that encode antibiotic egress pumps. The potential for finding a single target that is necessary for survival of strains harboring either of the known pumps that contribute to FQR could allow disruption of a wide spectrum of drug resistant mutants. A similar approach will be taken to identify targets that restore the therapeutic usefulness of FQ. High-density insertion pools in each of the FQR strain backgrounds will be subjected to treatment with the FQ antibiotic ciprofloxacin, and mutants that have low fitness in the presence of the drug relative to the rest of the population will be identified. To demonstrate that the screens identified candidates that are true targets, deletion mutations will be constructed and their ability to reproduce the predicted growth defects will be tested. Long term, the targets identified in this approach will be used in chemical screens to identify novel classes of antimicrobials that target FQR A. baumannii, allowing treatment of drug resistant mutants in hospital settings."

Measured behaviors include learning, memory, social preference, ultrasonic vocalization, sleep and anxiety. (2) Stem cell models: This Core component assists users to create disease models by generating induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) using standard reprogramming technologies or by genome editing, such as CRISPR-Cas, on established iPSC lines. These cells, some derived from humans with IDD, afford a model in which to scrutinize cellular consequences of genetic disease and to evaluate the efficacy of possible therapies. (3) Tissue culture models: This Core component supports users to generate tissue culture models in which to study the development and behavior of enriched or mixed populations of primary brain cells, including neurons, astrocytes, oligodendroglia, microglia and endothelia. These cells originate in genetically manipulated rodents or they are normal cells exposed to environmental stimuli, including drugs and toxins. The Tissue Culture Service and Stem Cell Service interact closely, since they share several in vitro methodologies and serve as a conduit to drive and help design rodent behavior testing. The PMC emphasizes training of users and their staff. Trained users can continue studies in their own laboratory or they can utilize the equipment in the PMC at reduced cost. This core interacts with others in the Center. It will exchange protocols, services and best practices with other IDDRCs in the Network. Relevance to IDDRC Mission: The PMC bridges all three domains of ?Genes, Brain, and Behavior?, the theme of the CHOP/Penn IDDRC (see Overall: Overview of Center). The Core was developed in response to a user survey (2014) that emphasized a need for an IDD-focused facility for the study of mammalian behavior and one to address the potential of current stem cell technologies, including CRISPR-Cas. Eligibility: These services are available both to approved users of the IDDRC at CHOP/UPenn and to users at other Centers in the Network."
"9380288","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our data indicates that STING (Stimulator of interferon genes) controls a key cytosolic DNA-sensing pathway and is responsible for DNaseII-deficient lethality and chronic polyarthritis (CP) as well as TREX1-mediated SLE-like disease in mice. For example, DNaseII mice die during embryonic development due to undigested DNA derived from apoptotic cells activating DNA sensors that trigger the production of type I IFN and pro- inflammatory cytokines. DNaseII-/- mice are born normally in the absence of STING, however, without any signs of inflammation-aggravated disease. Further, TREX1-/- mice which have a median lifespan of 10 weeks due to the development of inflammatory myocarditis remain viable when crossed onto a STING-/- background, and do not exhibit such disease. Mutations inTREX1 have been shown to be involved in Aicardi-Goutieres syndrome (AGS) in humans, typified by high levels of circulating type I IFN and early death. Despite this significant progres, the mechanisms that control STING function and the cytosolic DNA signaling pathway remain to be fully clarified. We thus propose two aims. The first is to further understand the mechanisms controlling STING function, such as by phosphorylation and the triggering of cytokine production responsible for inflammatory disease. The second aim is to study the mechanisms by which Trex1 may regulate STING. These objectives will shed considerable insight into mechanisms of innate immunity as well as into the causes of inflammatory disease."
"9513121","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Loss of cell polarity and invasive behavior are regarded as hallmarks of cancer, but surprisingly little is known about the mechanisms that preserve cell polarity during tissue growth and turnover. Polarity refers to the asymmetric partitioning of membrane components and subcellular structures, is oriented along both apicobasal and planar axes, and is essential for the proper assembly and function of epithelial tissues. The preservation of cell polarity is of crucial importance in tumor suppression and therefore, special mechanisms must exist to preserve polarity when cells divide. Consistent with this notion, we previously discovered a novel and unexpected mechanism that preserves planar polarity in dividing cells of the skin epidermis. More recent data demonstrate this mechanism is controlled directly by mitotic kinases, the same machinery that controls cell cycle progression and is deregulated in cancer. This is the first demonstration that cell division and planar cell polarity are controlled by the same regulatory machinery, and may explain why, in cancer, hyperproliferation and cellular disorder are so closely intertwined.  We hypothesize that the cell cycle machinery regulates cell polarity to ensure its preservation when cells divide, and that aberrations uncoupling polarity from cell cycle control will impair tissue architecture and proliferative homeostasis. Using a multifaceted approach combining mammalian genetics with cell biology, proteomics, and time-lapse imaging we will address our hypothesis in the context of epidermal development and regeneration. Specifically we will 1) define the cell cycle- dependent events that regulate planar cell polarity throughout mitotic progression; 2) determine how the landscape of proliferation across the epidermis impacts global planar cell polarity, and 3) decipher how perturbations in planar cell polarity influence proliferation and differentiation durig skin development and homeostasis.  Successful completion of the proposed experiments will bring a shift in our understanding of how tissue architecture and growth are connected where it is recognized that proliferation and cell polarity are connected by the same machinery. Understanding the mechanisms that mediate crosstalk between these two essential cell biological processes will help us to reevaluate current therapies that target cell cycle machinery in light of their effects on cell and tissue polarity."
"9390773","PROJECT SUMMARY Sepsis is common, has a high mortality rate, and is a very resource-intensive healthcare problem in the U.S.A. Sepsis is associated with cytokine storm, an exacerbated immune response, resulting in excessive vasodilation and severe vascular leakage leading to circulatory shock and multiple organ failure. As sepsis persists, patients often develop features of immunoparalysis. The majority of shock-related deaths occur during this secondary hypo-immune state, likely due to the failure to clear the initial infection and/or secondary nosocomial infection despite antibiotic treatment. We have found that mice deficient in mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) phosphatase (Mkp)-1, an inducible negative regulator of the p38 and JNK MAPKs, exhibit exacerbated inflammation following bacterial infections. These mice experienced a substantially enhanced cytokine storm and showed markedly increased mortality associated with vascular leak and circulatory collapse. Given the enhanced inflammatory response, paradoxically, Mkp-1-/- mice exhibited defective bacterial clearance. This picture of an augmented inflammatory response, and yet an inability to clear bacteria, mimics what is often seen in septic patients that go on to develop shock and multi-organ failure. However, the mechanisms leading to the impaired bactericidal activity in Mkp-1-/- mice are not known. Additionally, using bone marrow reconstituted mice, we found that Mkp-1 in cells of non-bone marrow origin (such as endothelial cells) plays a pivotal role in maintaining vascular barrier function. Our central hypothesis is that adequately enhancing Mkp-1 expression may dampen inflammation, enhance anti-bacterial immune defense, and improve barrier function, ultimately leading to better outcomes for patients with sepsis. Although Mkp-1 is critically important in the innate immune response, its regulation remains poorly understood. In preliminary studies we found that mutation of two serine residues at the C-terminus of Mkp-1, which mimics phosphorylation by ERK, increased Mkp-1 stability 20-fold without affecting Mkp-1 ubiquitination. Computer-based analysis suggests that the C-terminus of Mkp-1, adjacent to these two serine residues, contains an intrinsically disordered domain and that phosphorylation of these two serine residues decreases the disorder of this domain. This suggests that the ERK pathway stabilizes Mkp-1 via increasing the order of an intrinsic disorderd domain. Therefore, we propose to elucidate the function of Mkp-1 in phagocytes and endothelial cells and to define the mechanism by which ERK stabilizes the Mkp-1 protein. We will also determine if enhancing ERK activity can be an effective strategy for sustaining Mkp-1 expression, thereby preventing the second phase of p38 activation, ultimately inhibiting cytokine production. The objective of this application is to understand the function and regulation of Mkp-1 in phagocytes and endothelial cells during bacterial sepsis and determine if selective ERK activation can be an effective means to attenuate inflammation."
"9405587","PROJECT ABSTRACT Emergency contraception (EC) provides a woman with an additional line of defense against unintended pregnancy following an act of unprotected intercourse.

Our preliminary data provides evidence for testing a dose escalation strategy in an effort to provide improved efficacy from orally-dosed EC in obese women. We hypothesize that increasing the dose of orally-dosed EC agents will normalize the pharmacokinetics resulting in the expected treatment effect (delay in follicle rupture) in obese women. In this proposal, we plan to perform detailed pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies of ulipristal acetate- based EC in obese women and expand upon our preliminary findings of levonorgestrel-based EC."

"9378080","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Poxviruses are highly unusual among DNA viruses in replicating solely within the cytoplasm of the infected cell. This physical autonomy from the nucleus is accompanied by genetic complexity: ~200 viral gene products regulate diverse aspects of the viral life cycle. Despite this genetic autonomy, the close relationship between cell biological processes and the progression of the viral life cycle is increasingly clear. Nowhere is this interplay more evident than during the morphogenesis of nascent virions in the cytoplasm. The biogenesis of the poxvirus membrane is one of the most intriguing and puzzling questions in the field. Genetic analyses have identified the F10 protein kinase, and the A6, A11, A30.5, H7 and L2 regulatory proteins as essential mediators of crescent biogenesis. In their absence, membrane diversion and crescent formation are defective, but little is known about how they coordinate and induce membrane egress from the ER. Likewise, when the major membrane proteins A14 or A17 are repressed, crescents do not form, but large numbers of ~25 nm vesicles accumulate in the cytoplasm. Thus, they are essential for the shaping, stability and elongation of nascent membranes. Their role in mediating these processes remains unknown.  Our long-term goal is to fully understand poxviral membrane biogenesis. Our current objectives are to identify host proteins that enable the assembly and egress of viral ER exit sites, to understand the mechanism by which the viral regulatory proteins mediate this process, and to evaluate the dynamic interaction of A14 and A17 with membranes. We will accomplish these objectives by using genetic, cell biological and biochemical approaches to pursue three complementary Aims. Aim I: Analysis of the role of host proteins and membrane trafficking systems in viral morphogenesis. We will identify and analyze host proteins that are either substrates of the F10 protein kinase, associated with viral membrane intermediates, or important for viral membrane biogenesis. Aim II: Analysis of the A6, A11, A30.5, H7 and L2 proteins and their contributions to crescent biogenesis. This aim is focused on characterizing the biochemical properties of these 5 regulatory proteins, assessing their interaction with each other, with membranes, and with host proteins, and gaining insight into how they direct and facilitate membrane biogenesis. Aim III: Assessment of the association of A14 and A17 with membranes in vivo and in vitro. Using a variety of innovative in vitro and in vivo techniques, we will probe the topology of these proteins within membranes and test the hypothesis that they mediate membrane tubulation or heterotypic fusion."
"9395765","PROJECT SUMMARY Muscular dystrophies are a heterogeneous group of diseases characterized by striated muscle deterioration, resulting in loss of ambulation, respiratory insufficiency, and cardiomyopathy. Heart failure is a common cause of death for muscular dystrophy patients that is becoming an increasingly pressing concern as respiratory therapies allow patients to survive longer and succumb to heart disease. There are no effective therapies for dystrophic cardiomyopathy, stressing the need for novel insights into its progression and treatment. Our preliminary studies have used repeated bolus injections of the ?-adrenergic receptor (?AR) agonist isoproterenol (Iso) to stress the heart in two distinct dystrophic mouse strains. Male mice demonstrate poor survival and widespread cardiomyocyte necrosis in this challenge, while female mice display a remarkable survival benefit and very sparse myocyte necrosis with replacement lesions. These results suggest that female mice resolve initial injury and resist new damage while male mice succumb to their injury. Interestingly, continuous infusion of Iso results in the loss of female resilience, with both sexes displaying precipitous mortality, suggesting that the mechanism of female resilience depends on intermittent adrenergic stress. Iso is nonselective, stimulating both ?1-adrenergic receptors (?1AR) and ?2-adrenergic receptors (?2AR). ?1AR stimulation is proposed to cause the damaging response to Iso in the heart by increasing chronotropy and inotropy, while ?2AR activation has been associated with cardioprotection, likely through coupling to downstream signaling mechanisms distinct from those of ?1AR. These findings inform the central hypothesis that under intermittent adrenergic stress, initial cardiac injury drives female mice to attenuate the detrimental ?1AR-mediated response to Iso and enhance cardioprotective signaling through ?2?R in an estrogen- dependent manner. Furthermore, we hypothesize that the mechanism of ?2?R-mediated protection is lost during continuous stimulation, resulting in the loss of female resilience in that context. To evaluate the roles of ovarian hormones in female resilience, female dystrophic mice will undergo ovariectomy with and without replacement of estradiol (E2) and/or progesterone (P4). Their cardiac injury and survival after repeated bolus injections of Iso will be compared to intact female and male mice to reveal hormone-dependent changes. Next, we propose to measure mouse physiological responses and ?AR expression following repeated Iso injections or continuous infusion, with the purpose of identifying potential alterations in response attenuation and receptor regulation between sexes in each condition. Together, these aims will provide insights into the nature of dystrophic cardiac injury and the mechanism behind the resilience of female dystrophic hearts, while also potentially shedding new light on acquired heart diseases with known sex differences, advancing the long- term goal of identifying a protective pathway that may be clinically targeted to limit injury in patient hearts."
"9378055","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Myasthenia gravis (MG) is an autoimmune disorder of neuromuscular transmission. MG pathology is attributed to the presence of acetylcholine receptor (AChR) autoantibodies, which target the AChR at the neuromuscular junction. Many patients remain medically refractory or have intolerable adverse effects to current therapies; thus, another agent for the management of MG is needed. Several recent studies, including one performed by our group, have demonstrated the benefits of B cell depletion via rituximab treatment in MG patients. The NINDS-NeuroNEXT is conducting a multicenter randomized, double blind, placebo controlled Phase II clinical trial evaluating the therapeutic effect of rituximab for MG. We have exclusively partnered with this trial so that we can first, improve the understanding of the mechanism of action of B cell depletion in MG and second, so that fundamental questions regarding human autoimmunity can be addressed. Specimens prior to, during and after treatment are under collection for our work. This study presents a unique opportunity to study both drug and disease mechanisms because unlike many other autoimmune diseases in which rituximab has been used, MG affords the investigation of antigen-specific components that directly participate in the immunopathology of the disease. Our mechanistic studies will test the hypothesis that the mechanism underlying clinical benefit involves a reservoir of T cell-dependent, autoreactive memory B cells that supply a population of antibody secreting cells and is critical to MG autoantibody production. Rituximab eliminates this reservoir of memory B cells; then the newly formed B cell compartment is reshaped such that autoantibody production is diminished. To test this hypothesis, we have developed/applied assays to measure B cell tolerance defects, describe the repertoire of the B cell compartments and the B cell subsets that produce MG autoantibodies and characterize the antigen-specific T cells. This work will further our understanding of MG immunopathology and it represents the first step toward gaining a more complete understanding of the immune mechanisms underlying the treatment of B cell-mediated autoimmune diseases with rituximab. This proposal is directly relevant to the human disease and is in clear alignment and relevance to the mission of the NIH. That is, this translational research focuses on studying the human disease with human-derived cells. Furthermore, the importance of studying MG is magnified by its service as a model for antibody-mediated disease. Innovative, novel technology such as next generation sequencing and antigen-specific T cell assays will be applied to answer fundamental questions. The study is designed to elucidate the pathogenic role of major immunological components in MG, that is the contribution of B and T cells, including an investigation of fundamental autoimmune mechanisms, namely B cell tolerance and T cell pathogenic phenotypes. Through studying MG cell-mediated immunology we will further define the events that both initiate and propagate this disease that will provide fundamental insight into the mechanisms of autoimmune disease."
"9378417","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The ligand-dependent transcription factor ROR?t regulates the development and functions of lymphocytes, including Th17 cells and type 3 innate lymphoid cells (ILC3) that have central roles in mucosal barrier protection and in mediating multiple autoimmune inflammatory diseases. Targeting of ROR?t by small molecule inhibitors is a strategy that has been successfully validated in animal models and is being developed for therapeutic application in human autoimmune diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease, psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, and, potentially, multiple sclerosis. Although many of the targets of ROR?t and other key transcription factors involved in Th17 cell differentiation have been identified, the roles of ROR?t in the gene regulatory programs of other cell types, e.g. thymocytes, ILC3, and lymphoid tissue inducer cells, have not been studied, nor have the roles of the closely-related ROR? isoform that is expressed outside of the immune system. A better understanding of how ROR?t executes cell type-specific functions may facilitate development of better strategies to selectively inhibit its activities in the desired cells and tissues. We have ued genetic and proteomics screens to identify molecules that contribute to ROR?t-dependent target gene regulation in Th17 cells, either indirectly or directly by associating with ROR?t complexes. Molecules identified in both screens include nuclear pore proteins that have been recently implicated as having roles in the nucleoplasm as well as the nuclear envelope. We propose to study the roles of Nup98 and Nup153, proteins that interact with ROR?t and contribute to the expression of a large number of ROR?t target genes. In preliminary studies, we have identified mutations in ROR?t that abrogate interaction with Nup153. Mice with one of these mutations have impaired Th17 cell induction but normal T cell development. We will extend our studies with Th17 cells, and also study the role of the ROR?t-nucleoporin interactions in differentiation and function of TCR-??-17 cells and ILC3 and in the development of lymphoid tissue inducer cells and thymocytes. For the first aim, we will characterize the biochemical basis of the interaction of ROR?t with Nup153 and Nup98 and will determine how this interaction influences formation of ROR?t transcriptional complexes and the DNA occupancy of each factor in polarized Th17 cells. We will also examine the effect of ligand binding on association of ROR?t with its partners, taking advantage of small molecule antagonists and our finding that Nup98 regulates enzymes involved in cholesterol biosynthesis, which may thus influence endogenous ligand availability. In Aim 2, we will introduce relevant mutations into the mouse germ line and examine the effect on chromatin accessibility and gene expression programs in Th17 cells generated in vitro and in vivo and in other ROR?t-dependent cells. In Aim 3, we will use mice with the various point mutations in ROR?t or its partner proteins to determine the effects in models of Th17-mediated autoimmune disease or ILC3-dependent barrier protection. Together, these studies will help in the design of better screens for cell type-selective targeting of ROR?t functions."
"9391429","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Chronic pain is a widespread international health problem that imposes costs of over 600 billion dollars per year. This application focuses on fibromyalgia (FM), which is characterized by persistent, widespread body pain, with significant evidence of altered brain function. One of the few effective treatments for FM is cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), which has been shown to reduce pain intensity and pain-related disability, potentially via reductions in catastrophizing, an important psychosocial factor that plays a crucial role in shaping individual differences in pain- related outcomes. It is likely that brain mechanisms underpin the beneficial effects of lowered catastrophizing and reduced pain in FM, and CBT-produced decrements in catastrophizing may act to normalize dysfunctional central nervous system pain processing. Our previous study in FM patients confirms that patients who are high in catastrophizing show enhanced pain-related activation in brain areas that process emotional aspects of pain (e.g., anterior insula and medial thalamus). In addition, catastrophizing was associated with altered pain-evoked functional connectivity between thalamus, anterior insula, and default mode network (DMN) structures such as medial prefrontal cortex. The DMN is a constellation of brain regions that mediate self- focused cognitive processing; our prior work has implicated altered resting-state functional connectivity between DMN and insula as a biomarker for clinical pain in FM. In our pilot study, a subset of FM patients was randomized to CBT or an active educational control condition. We found that CBT reduced catastrophizing and produced corresponding changes in brain activation and DMN connectivity. In the present proposal, we hypothesize that CBT-produced improvements in pain will be anticipated and mediated by reductions in catastrophizing and their associated effects on pain-related brain functioning. Participants with FM will be randomized to 8 weekly treatments with CBT or an education/attention control, and followed up for 6 months. Functional MRI data, including functional connectivity during both a resting and evoked deep- tissue pain state, will be collected at baseline, mid-treatment, and after the final treatment visit. We hypothesize that CBT will reduce catastrophizing early in treatment, resulting in adaptive changes in the brain's responses to an externally-applied noxious stimulus. These changes will then predict subsequent changes in patients' resting state connectivity in DMN and pain- relevant brain regions, which will underlie long-term improvements in clinical pain. Our overarching goal is to understand the neurobiological pathways by which CBT and reduced catastrophizing facilitate improvements in chronic pain; such information will help to refine biopsychosocial models of pain, identify potential non-responders early in treatment, and facilitate the enhancement of psychosocial interventions for chronic musculoskeletal pain."

This proposal will use state-of-the art molecular, biochemical, immunological, and genetic approaches to probe aspects of alginate pathogenesis and to reevaluate some long-standing paradigms. To date, the mechanisms underlying biofilm formation by alginate producing bacteria is not well understood. Aim 1 will investigate the biochemical and genetic basis for alginate biofilm matrix maintenance of biofilm integrity, structure, and antimicrobial resistance properties. While it is clear that mucoid variants predominate during chronic airway infection in CF patients, rarely are they present as pure clonal mucoid isolates. Instead, mucoid bacteria are typically associated with mixed populations of wild type P. aeruginosa that have not undergone mucoid conversion, as well as spontaneous suppressors that arise. The goal of Aim 2 is to test the hypothesis that this mixed consortia confers fitness benefits to the P. aeruginosa community as a whole that is not observed in either nonmucoid or mucoid bacteria alone. Alginate expression in the CF lung correlates with a poor clinical prognosis. However there are gaps in our knowledge regarding specific properties that alginate overproduction affords bacteria and the microbial consortia within the airway. The completion of these aims will lead to a deeper understanding of alginate biology and translate into novel therapies or interventions for CF patients colonized with mucoid P. aeruginosa."
"9390763","Cryptococcus neoformans is a deadly fungal pathogen that exhibits pronounced neurotropism: it is the most common cause of fungal meningitis, particularly in immunocompromised patients, resulting in over 620,000 deaths annually. How C. neoformans cells traverse the blood-brain barrier (BBB) to infect the central nervous system (CNS) remains poorly understood. Our recent studies implicate inositol ? one of the most abundant metabolites in the brain ? in this process. In particular, we find that growth of C. neoformans under inositol-rich conditions enhances fungal virulence and that fungal mutants defective in inositol uptake exhibit reduced virulence, reduced capacity to transmigrate from the blood into the brain, and reduced ability to traverse a model BBB in vitro. We also find that C. neoformans compromises tight-junction integrity in vitro, promoting inositol leakage through the brain microvascular endothelial monolayer. Furthermore, we show that inositol induces the expression of fungal cell surface factors involved in virulence, including the polysaccharide capsule, a major fungal virulence factor, and hyaluronic acid (HA), a ligand important for fungal binding to the BBB. Finally, we find that growth on inositol promotes the production of capsule structures involved in immune evasion and that, conversely, C. neoformans mutants defective in inositol uptake elicit enhanced protective immunity during brain infection. Based on these results, we hypothesize that C. neoformans senses and utilizes host inositol to modify the fungal cell surface in a way that promotes penetration of the BBB and development of cryptococcal meningitis. Interestingly, C. neoformans contains an unusually complex inositol uptake system and catabolic pathway, which likely evolved from its utilization of the inositol stores of its plant reservoirs. Thus, this fungus may be uniquely adapted to thrive in the inositol-rich environment of the CNS and to utilize inositol-dependent pathways for pathogenesis. The overarching goal of this proposal is to obtain a detailed understanding of the mechanism by which C. neoformans acquires and utilizes host inositol to establish human brain infection. We propose three Specific Aims: 1) Define inositol sensing and metabolic pathways required for modifying fungal cell surface structure by using a combination of fungal mutagenesis analysis, enzymatic assays, and polysaccharide structural analysis; 2) Characterize the mechanism of inositol- mediated promotion of C. neoformans BBB crossing and CNS infection by using an in vitro BBB model system and in vivo animal models; and 3) Define the transcriptional circuits regulating inositol-dependent processes during cryptococcal brain infection by analyzing the expression and localization of fungal inositol factors and identifying transcription factors regulating their expression during infection. Together, these studies will elucidate a novel contribution of a brain metabolite, inositol, to the development of life-threatening fungal meningitis. As such, these studies promise to provide substantial insight into mechanisms by which pathogens cross the BBB and establish CNS infections."
"9389353","(RESEARCHPROJECT:MEGINASD) PROJECT SUMMARY We have developed magnetoencephalography (MEG) measures that predict both a diagnosis of ASD and the degree of language impairment. Thus, (i) auditory encoding latency (M100) discriminates ASD versus non- ASD; (ii) auditory change detection latency (mismatch field, MMF) predicts severity of language impairment in ASD and in other groups with a developmental disability; and (iii) lexical distinction (word versus non-word low-frequency neural oscillatory activity) both predicts language impairment as well as atypical hemispheric specialization for language in ASD and, perhaps, in other neurodevelopmental groups. Prior imaging studies of ASD (including our own) have focused on an intellectually higher-functioning population (high-functioning autism, or HFA). One reason for this bias is that the majority of imaging studies entail magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which presupposes a participant's ability to remain motionless during the study, thereby disqualifying from study the large ASD population with language delay and intellectual disability (possibly as high as 50%). We seek to investigate the neural basis of autism and associated language and cognitive impairment in an under-studied population of minimally verbal/non-verbal ASD children (MVNV-ASD, N = 40, aged 8 to 12 years). To this end, MVNV-ASD encoding, change detection, and lexical MEG measures will be compared with the same measures already available in age-matched HFA and typically developing (TD) children. Using the same tasks, MEG data will be obtained from a ?positive control? group of children with intellectual disability (ID; N =40) but without ASD, matched for age and non-verbal IQ in order to isolate neural abnormalities specific to MVNV-ASD and not consequent to impairment of general cognitive function. Thus, our primary goals are: (a) A search for pathogenic mechanisms common to HFA and MVNV-ASD, thereby enabling a deeper understanding of the pathogenesis of disability across the ASD spectrum; and (b) A search for mechanisms of language impairment that are ASD-specific rather than a consequence of more general effects of low cognitive ability. To obtain high-quality MEG data, we will deploy a research strategy we designate ?MEG-PLAN (MEG Protocol for Low-Language/Cognitive Functioning Ability Neuroimaging). The key elements of MEG-PLAN are: (1) Engage stakeholders (parents/providers) as ?partners in research? to develop a MEG scanning protocol that maximizes data collection success; (2) Examine automatic brain responses elicited with passive auditory paradigms, thereby obviating the need for participants to attend to the task or provide feedback; (3) Remove the need for an individual MRI to localize the MEG signal source by using a MEG which is registered to an age-appropriate template MRI; (4) Achieve motion tolerance of up to 2 cm via real-time MEG head tracking/motion compensation. This study addresses focus area #2 in the RFA ? ?Outcome Measures for Interventions or Treatments?."
"9378030","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The surface commensal microbial community has been shown to influence the function and development of the immune system, thus potentially participating in the pathophysiology of several important diseases of the skin, gut, kidney and lung. With increased appreciation that normal microbial communities exist in equilibrium with, and in many cases benefit the host, recent work has sought to better understand the mechanisms by which we permit survival of our skin commensal microbiome and how the microbiome controls mammalian immune responses. We have discovered that it was wrong to assume that bacteria are normally totally separated from us by the epidermis. Strong evidence now shows that microbial communities are in an equilibrium across the basement membrane zone and populate the dermal stroma. These observations show that the surface microbiome is in direct contact with live cells in the dermis, and therefore is in a prime position to influence local and systemic immunity. Importantly, the observation that microbes enter the dermis is not evidence for infection, rather this findings show that products made by microbes are communicating with dermal cells. The overall goal of this proposal is to understand the elements of the skin barrier that regulate microbial entry into the dermis and begin to test the hypothesis that changes in the dermal microbial community result in altered cutaneous immune responses. Our aims are as follows: Aim 1: Understand the role of filaggrin in control of entry of the microbiome and immune modulation. Aim 2: Study how the function of the dermal microbiome is influenced by cathelicidin expression Aim 3: Characterize the dermal microbiome in Atopic Dermatitis before and after skin barrier therapy. Successful completion of these aims will provide new understanding of the skin immune system and can clarify the pathophysiology of inflammatory skin diseases such as atopic dermatitis."
"9386055","Abstract  Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a complex autoimmune disease that affects as many as one in 2500 individuals. We discovered that 43% of lupus patients have dramatically increased numbers of peripheral blood B cells that express the transcription factor ARID3a. Numbers of ARID3a+ B lymphocytes were associated with increased disease activity, suggesting that ARID3a might contribute to, or be a consequence of, disease activity. The underlying reasons for increased ARID3a expression in blood cells from lupus patients, and its association with disease activity are unclear. Our data now indicate that ARID3a+ B cells produce interferon alpha, a Type I interferon previously associated with inflammatory processes and increased disease activity in SLE. It is unlikely that B lymphocytes secrete sufficient quantities of interferon to explain the high levels associated with SLE. Preliminary data indicate that plasmacytoid dendritic cells and neutrophils also show high levels of ARID3a expression in a subset of SLE blood samples, as compared to healthy controls. Intriguingly, ARID3a expression in those cells is associated with production of interferon alpha. Additional data suggest that ARID3a, and interferon alpha, are induced in healthy blood cells through toll-like receptor signals, particularly CpG. These data link ARID3a expression to normal innate immune responses. Inhibition of ARID3a in B lymphoblastoid cells also inhibits interferon alpha expression, suggesting ARID3a plays a role in regulating interferon production in those cells. We hypothesize that ARID3a expression is associated with interferon production in neutrophils and plasmacytoid dendritic cells, and that ARID3a+ neutrophils and/or dendritic cells are associated with disease pathogenesis in SLE. Furthermore, we hypothesize that ARID3a expression is induced as a consequence of innate immune signals in hematopoietic stem cell progenitor populations, and that ARID3a-expressing progenitors contribute to interferon signatures observed in SLE. The proposed studies will define associations between ARID3a expression and innate immune responses in neutrophils and plasmacytoid dendritic cells in lupus and healthy control samples. Requirements for ARID3a in interferon production will be evaluated using ARID3a knockdown experiments. Genes potentially regulated by ARID3a in innate immune signaling pathways will be identified. Finally, we will use humanized mouse models to evaluate the consequences of induced ARID3a expression in healthy hematopoietic progenitors. The results of these experiments will fill important gaps in our understanding of regulatory responses in innate immunity and abnormal responses observed in SLE that are associated with ARID3a. Ultimately, we expect these data to have broader impacts that increase our understanding of inflammatory responses associated with normal innate immunity and with autoimmune disease."
"9379445","PROJECT SUMMARY This application is focused on understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying reprogramming of lipid metabolism in CD4 T helper subsets, and assessing the impact of sterol metabolism on T helper cell function. Accumulating evidence indicates that CD4 T helper cells rapidly change their metabolic state in response to TCR activation and cytokine signals. This reprogramming is necessary to match the bioenergetic and biosynthetic requirements of specific effector functions. In general pro-inflammatory CD4 T cells (e.g., Th1 and Th17) acquire a robust glycolytic program, and shift their metabolism towards an anabolic state. In contrast, regulatory T cells are largely reliant on fatty acid oxidation and macromolecule catabolism to meet their bioenergetic and biosynthetic requirements. This distinction in metabolic programming appears to be essential for proper T helper cell function. Genetic or pharmacologic manipulation of a T helper cell's metabolic state can attenuate or exacerbate specific effector functions. For example, enforcing a glycolytic program perturbs the suppressive ability of Tregs, and results in a loss of self-tolerance in models systems. In contrast, enforcing fatty acid oxidative metabolism downregulates the pro-inflammatory function of Th1 and Th17 cells, thereby attenuating disease pathogenesis. These observations have led to the concept that a CD4 T helper cells metabolic state is a fundamental component of the effector program. Despite the clear importance of acquiring and maintaining the appropriate metabolic state, the molecular mechanisms underlying how distinct T helper cells acquire the requisite metabolic programs remain poorly understood. In recent work we have identified the sterol regulatory element binding proteins (SREBP1 and 2) as critical regulators of metabolic reprogramming in CD8 T cells. Mechanistic studies revealed that SREBPs are activated by TCR signals and drive acquisition of glycolysis and anabolic metabolism. In the absence of SREBP activity, we found that CD8 T cells were unable to upregulate glycolytic flux and synthesis of lipids, resulting in poor proliferative capacity and attenuated effector responses. These data have led us to hypothesize that SREBPs would play a critical function in regulating the CD4 T helper subset differentiation and effector function. In support of this hypothesis, we find in preliminary data that attenuation of the SREBP program selectively perturbs the in vitro differentiation of Th1 and Th17 cells, but does not influence induction of regulatory T cells, nor does it influence the generation/homeostasis of Foxp3-positive Tregs in vivo. Thus, we conclude that SREBP signaling plays an important and previously undefined role in controlling the balance of T helper subsets. In this application, we extend on these intriguing preliminary data and propose three integrated aims designed to elucidate the molecular mechanism(s) by which SREBPs influence T helper cell function, and determine if these metabolic pathways control the balance between self-tolerance and autoimmunity."
"9378081","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): With escalating global access to HIV antiretroviral (ARV) therapy, treatment failure is inevitable and must be anticipated. Correct and early diagnosis of treatment failure is essential for cost savings, durable response to therapy and prevention of morbidity and mortality. Most HIV treatment programs in the developing world either do not have access to viral load (VL) testing, the gold-standard treatment monitoring modality, or can apply it only on a limited basis. Other monitoring technologies such as drug resistance testing are even less common for financial and infrastructure constraints. In this proposal we will develop, evaluate and implement methods to optimize monitoring of ARV therapy in resource limited settings (RLS) that have diverse VL availability. Though several recent studies have proposed and evaluated lower-cost markers as VL surrogates and strategies for selective VL use, they generally are not based on a formal, decision theoretic framework that allows discovery of strategies with optimality properties that can be expressed in terms of misclassification rate, cost, and other clinically relevant parameters. We propose to develop the statistical framework, theory and methods required to discover optimal diagnostic algorithms for monitoring treatment failure with limited or no VL availability; to use cohort data from both the US and Kenya to derive, calibrate and cross-validate the algorithms; to use extant plasma samples from patients in a PEPFAR-funded HIV care program to design and cross-validate a new diagnostic algorithm that includes implementation of pooled assays; and to develop usable software that will enable programs to design their own protocols based on the characteristics of their patient population and local capacity for viral load testing."
"9379466","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There is a fundamental gap in understanding how the physicochemical properties of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) contribute to hazard generation in the lung. Without this knowledge, it is difficult to evaluate CNT safety in a predictive and affordable manner. The long-term goal of our multidisciplinary approach is to develop a predictive toxicological approach for CNT safety assessment in which the physicochemical properties leading to hazardous interactions at the nano/bio interface can be used to understand the materials' pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrogenic effects in the lung. The overall objective of this application is to develop a series of single- wall (SW) and multi-wall carbon nanotube (MWCNT) libraries that can be screened by robust cellular assays to establish quantitative structure activity relationships (SARs) and hazard ranking of the tubes' potential to induce pulmonary damage. Our central hypothesis is that tube dimensions (including length, diameter and aspect ratio), state of dispersion, catalytic surface chemistry, electronic properties and purity play key roles in initiating cooperative cellular interactions in macrophages and cellular elements from the epithelial- mesenchymal trophic unit, which are key to the development of development of pulmonary inflammation and fibrosis. The rationale for the proposed research is that once the quantitative contributions of specific physicochemical properties to hazard generation is known, it will be possible to use a predictive toxicology approach for expedited safety assessment of CNTs as well as their safer design. Guided by strong preliminary data, this hypothesis will be tested by pursuing three specific aims: Aim 1: To develop hazard ranking that relates the properties of well-prepared and characterized MWCNT and SWCNT libraries to mechanistic toxicological responses in epithelial cells and macrophages, with a view to develop quantitative structure- activity relationships (SARs) that predict in vivo injury potential. Aim 2: To develop and validate a predictive toxicological paradigm for pulmonary hazard potential of well-characterized commercial and purified CNTs, using in vitro SAR-based hazard ranking and grouping of materials that can also be used towards a tiered risk assessment approach. Aim 3: To use covalent and non-covalent surface modification to demonstrate the feasibility of safe-by-design approaches for CNTs, using a predictive toxicological approach. Our approach is innovative, because it represents a substantive departure from the status quo, namely the use of purified and well- prepared CNTs that are investigated according to robust toxicological mechanisms that predict the in vivo toxicological outcome. The proposed research is significant because: (i) it addresses the concern of how to perform CNT safety assessment using a robust, quantitative scientific platform; (ii) the establishment of a robust safety platform based on grouping of CNT properties that can be used for control banding and read- across risk assessment; (iii) the research will develop an affordable and rational scientific platform for regulatory decision-making and product approval towards the marketplace."
"9388310","ABSTRACT Inflammatory signaling by macrophages in response to pathogens or tissue injury is the key determinant of the pathology and pathogenesis of infectious and non-infectious disease. The transcription factor NF?B controls the inflammatory gene expression programs, but it remains unclear how its regulation determines healthy or disease-associated gene expression responses. During the previous funding period, we have used a combined experimental / computational modeling approach to gain a predictive understanding of how NF?B is activated in response to TLR signaling and that multiple mechanisms converge to regulate NF?B. After developing a live cell microscopy tracking workflow we discovered that contrary to previous notions NF?B dynamics are highly oscillatory. By generating a knockin RelA-Venus mouse, we are able ? for the first time ? measure NF?B dynamics in primary cells revealing oscillations as an intrinsic hallmark of NF?B in healthy macrophages. Based on preliminary studies, we propose to test the hypothesis that NF?B oscillations are critical for healthy macrophage functions as they preserve their epigenetic chromatin state. Non-oscillatory NF?B is more likely to alter the macrophage-characteristic chromatin state and lead to altered, disease-associated gene expression. Further, while oscillations are pervasive, their duration is modulated by different stimuli, allowing for differential, stimulus-specific gene expression programs. Together, the proposed studies will substantially contribute to our understanding of how NF?B dynamic control determines physiological and pathological gene expression programs."
"9378777","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Human monocytic ehrlichiosis is an emerging tick-borne zoonosis caused by Ehrlichia chaffeensis (Ech), an obligatory intracellular bacterium. The essential virulence factor of Ech is its entry into human monocytes through the route permissive for its replication. To advance our basic understanding and permit development of new therapies, our long-term goal is to elucidate the mechanisms that mediate Ech infectious entry. Our recent study revealed that Ech uses EtpE (Entry triggering protein of Ehrlichia), a unique surface-exposed outer membrane protein to engage the human cell surface glycosylphosphatidyl-inositol-anchored protein DNase X, which induces its entry into host cells to establish prolific infection. How EtpE binding to DNase X triggers infectious Ech entry is unknown. Our preliminary data revealed CD147, hnRNP-K, and N-WASP interact with the EtpE-DNase X complex. Thus, our hypothesis is that EtpE-DNase X binding anchors and activates N- WASP via CD147 and hnRNP-K to elicit spatio-temporal actin polymerization that drives Ech entry. In this application, we will pursue two aims to understand how EtpE binding to DNase X drives infectious Ech entry. Specific Aim 1 is to identify the EtpE-interacting host proteins and their mechanistic contributions to EtpE- triggered Ech entry and infection. We will analyze 1) whether CD147 and hnRNP-K are required for EtpE- coated bead entry, and Ech entry and infection of host cells and mice including use of mice with conditional Cre/LoxP CD147 knock-out in macrophages; 2) the spatio-temporal recruitment profiles of CD147 and hnRNP- K at entry foci of Ech and of EtpE-coated beads, by live-cell/intravital fluorescence microscopy; 3) proteins involved in the EtpE-host protein interaction, using a) tandem affinity purification and b subtractive multidimensional protein identification technology; 4) the determinants/kinetics of the binding of CD147 and hnRNP-K to the EtpE-C-DNase X complex, by fluorescence resonance transfer, in vivo bimolecular fluorescence complementation, and in vitro binding assays, using defined domains and mutant proteins; and 5) monocyte tropism using human neutrophils and a granulocyte-tropic obligatory intracellular bacterium. Specific Aim 2 is to elucidate mechanisms to coordinate the spatio-temporal N-WASP activation at Ech entry foci. We will analyze 1) recruitment of N-WASP at entry foci of Ech and of EtpE-coated beads in a DNase X, CD147, and hnRNP-K-dependent manner; 2) requirement of N-WASP for entry of Ech and EtpE-coated beads, and infection of host cells and mice including the use of conditional Cre/LoxP N-WASP knock-out in macrophages; 3) requirement of DNase X, CD147, hnRNP-K, and N-WASP for EtpE-triggered polymerization of pyrenyl-actin in vitro; and 4) the spatio-temporal recruitment profiles of N-WASP and F-actin to entry foci of Ech and EtpE- coated beads, using live-cell imaging. If our hypothesis is proven, EtpE would be the first bacterial molecule described to activate N-WASP through a unique protein complex for infectious entry. The identified pathways will provide a platform for developing new prophylactic and therapeutic strategies against Ech."
"9396538","Veterans involved in the legal system have more extensive mental health (MH) and substance use (SU) disorders than other Veterans. Veterans frequently report legal difficulties related to obtaining and using VA health care benefits. In community samples, 54%-60% with civil legal problems have SU and MH disorders, and an estimated 56% of community samples with MH and SU disorders have civil legal problems, most often in the health care domain. The prevalence of legal, MH, and SU problems is likely higher in Veteran than in community populations. Resolution of patients' civil legal problems is associated with lower health care costs.  A new model, VA-hosted legal clinics, has developed, with an emphasis on helping Veterans to gain access to VA health care (e.g., obtain needed military discharge upgrades and VA benefits), and to address civil legal issues that are barriers to utilizing treatment even when Veterans have access to care (e.g., driver's license reinstatement to enable transportation to health appointments). By addressing legal needs, VA-based legal clinics help Veterans receive health care services and improve their health and quality of life. However, even with access, Veterans with SU and MH disorders are likely to need intensive (or facilitated) referral to initiate and engage with treatment.  Despite their rapidly increasing number, there has been no systemwide study of VA-legal clinics in terms of population served, function, or organization, or empirically-based suggestions on how to further improve their usefulness to VA and Veterans, such as their potential as a setting in which Veterans with MH and SU problems may receive assistance with linking to VA health services to improve their well-being. This project will conduct a survey (developed and pretested prior to funding, in a currently-funded Locally Initiated Project) of all VA legal clinics nationwide. The survey (N=120) will determine the extent to which VA-located legal clinics: (a) assess and identify Veteran clients' SU and MH problems, and facilitate and monitor use of VA SU and MH services by clients; (b) view legal clinics as a feasible point of intervention by intensive referral to facilitate transition to and engagement with the VA health care system by Veterans in need of SU and MH care; and (c) are characterized by additional transition barriers and facilitators identified in our conceptual model. This project will also collaborate with the VA Palo Alto legal clinic to assess and follow its Veteran clients. The purpose will be to collect data on clients' acceptance of participating in a longitudinal research project that tracks their SU and MH problems and VA treatment and outcomes (via self-reports and health records), and to publish findings on changes in these Veterans' legal and health status. The survey and client data will be used in a subsequent IIR proposal to intervene with VA legal clinic clients using an intensive referral approach to facilitate their transition to needed VA health care services and improve outcomes.  This project meets priorities of the VA Blueprint for Excellence, HSR&D, the Center for Innovation to Implementation (the research team's HSR&D Center of Innovation), our VA operations partner, the Veterans Justice Programs, and the White House Legal Aid Interagency Roundtable. This research program has the potential to improve access to care by a sizable but underserved and vulnerable Veteran population. The pilot project will fill a critical gap by gathering information about functions of the rapidly expanding number of VA- located legal clinics, and about health services needs of Veterans they serve. We will use the pilot's findings in an IIR project to develop and test an intervention to facilitate transition to treatment and thus enable better outcomes among Veterans using VA-based legal clinics. Our ultimate goal is to improve practices across VA facilities by which Veterans using legal clinics are referred to, initiate, and engage in treatment, in order to improve their health outcomes and reduce their use of expensive health services. This research program will contribute to better coordination between VA and community systems working to improve Veterans' well-being."
"9378715","I am a pulmonary immunologist with over 20 years of experience in studies of inflammatory/infectious diseases in the lungs and at the systemic level. Sixteen of those years, I have worked at the Ann Arbor VAHS. My overall career goal is to expand the understanding of host pathogen interactions, specifically the effect of microbe- and host-derived signals on the fate of the immune response. I deeply believe that an understanding of these interactions will create a foundation for the development of safe and effective immunomodulatory therapies that will greatly enhance the effectiveness of antimicrobial therapeutics in persistent infections. Our lab has specialized in animal modeling and translational studies applying these principles, which are highly relevant to broader range of diseases as shown by more recent clinical data. Over the last 15 years, my studies have mostly focused on host pathogen interactions between invasive fungus C. neoformans and the mammalian immune system. The studies of invasive fungal infections are of specific interest to the VA, because of the higher than average rate of immunocompromised patients among veterans and increased risk of exposure to various endemic and environmental fungi due to locations and conditions of military service that favor fungal exposures. Unfortunately, the invasive fungal infections have unacceptably high mortality rates, due to limited effectiveness of antifungal drugs, toxicity, and the high potential of fungal organisms to develop resistance to these drugs. Thus, it is crucial to understand the effects of immunomodulation on fungal disease from the perspective of the natural mechanisms of host defenses, mechanisms of immune evasion exhibited by fungi, and to explore pre-clinical approaches of immuno-modulatory therapies. The long-standing support of VA BLR&D was one of the crucial factors that allowed our group to establish itself among leaders in cryptococcal and fungal immunology. While this support has led to many important findings, there is still a lot more that we need to learn before we can safely and efficiently apply immunomodulatory therapies in persistent infections. The VA RCS Award will allow our group to continue this great work and create stability supportive of exploration of very novel but more risky directions of research. This award will also allow to further broaden PI?s collaborative interactions with physician scientists, enhance training efforts, and to continue PI?s service to the scientific community at the VA and beyond."
"9563938","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): HIV-1 integrase (IN) has an essential, multifunctional role in virus replication and serves as an important therapeutic target. During the early stage of HIV-1 replication IN catalyzes the covalent insertion of viral cDNA into the host chromosome. This process is mediated by cellular chromatin associated protein LEDGF/p75, which both markedly enhances integration efficiency and preferentially guides HIV-1 integration to actively transcribed genes. Structural interactions between HIV-1 IN and LEDGF/p75 have been well characterized, but until recently little was known about how LEDGF/p75 recognizes select chromatin sites. During the past funding cycle we have elucidated structural and mechanistic basis for preferential and tight binding of the PWWP domain, the key chromatin binding module of LEDGF/p75, to cognate mononucleosomes (MNs). In particular, we have demonstrated that cooperative binding of the hydrophobic cavity and basic surface of LEDGF PWWP to the histone H3 tail containing trimethylated Lys36 (H3K36me3) and DNA wrapped in MNs is essential for high-affinity binding of LEDGF/p75 to chromatin. These studies will now be extended in aim 1 to characterize the interplay between full-length LEDGF/p75, H3K36me3 epigenetic marks, and HIV-1 integration sites in vitro and in infected cells. Aim 2 of the present application will focus on testing the hypothesis that HIV-1 IN plays an active role during the viru particle maturation. The rationale for this notion was provided by previous findings that certain substitutions in the IN coding region or addition of allosteric IN inhibitors induce eccentric maturation of virus particles. A hallmark of this eccentric phenotype is the mislocalization of the ribonucleoprotein complexes (RNPs) in mature virions. While infectious virions contain RNPs embedded within the capsid core, the eccentric particles have RNPs localized between the empty or translucent capsid core and the particle membrane. These experiments have highlighted a potential role of IN during the late steps of virus maturation. However, little is known as to how IN could contribute to proper particle morphogenesis. Here, we present our preliminary data showing that HIV-1 IN interacts directly and with high affinity with highly structured viral RNA segments in vitro and in virus particles. These preliminary findings suggest previously undescribed roles of HIV-1 IN during virus particle maturation and provide compelling rationale for our structural and virology studies proposed in aim 2. The proposed experiments are expected to fill the critical gap in our knowledge of how multifunctional IN contributes to the late stage of HIV-1 replication."
"9588837","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Unilateral vocal fold paralysis (UVFP) is a debilitating condition with major health and quality of life implications. It is caused by injury to the recurret laryngeal nerve and is iatrogenic in 50% of cases, most commonly from thyroidectomy or anterior cervical disc fusion surgeries. Rates of these procedures have increased several fold in the last few decades, which when combined with other surgical, traumatic, and other etiologies puts a correspondingly increased proportion of patients at risk for this condition. The quality of life consequences for patients with UVFP-associated voice disturbances are worse than those with asthma, acute coronary syndrome and depression. From a health perspective, 60% of UVFP patients suffer from dysphagia (23% among these have aspiration), and 75% have breathing difficulties. The basic tenet of treatment is to recapitulate the laryngeal sphincter to permit vocal fold closure thereby improving voice and swallowing, reducing aspiration risk, and normalizing respiration. Treatment algorithms vary widely based on timing and type of intervention. However, significant practice variation exists with advocates of each touting their advantages; however, no standard measure exists to compare their relative effectiveness at relieving symptoms related to all domains of laryngeal function (e.g. voice, swallowing, and breathing). Lack of a standard composite measure of UVFP-attributable disability is a barrier to quantifying patient disability, tracking symptom improvement, and comparing treatment effectiveness. To date, objective measures (e.g. acoustics) have not consistently correlated with symptomatic improvement. Therefore, patient reported outcome measures (PROM) assessing quality of life and disability are arguably most relevant and should be used to optimize our treatment algorithms. No PROM currently evaluates all aspects of laryngeal function; instead their scope is limited to voice or swallowing, and none assess laryngeal- associated respiratory dysfunction. Such deficiencies in clinically applicable measures have limited our ability to comprehensively assess patient response to interventions aimed at treating UVFP. This proposal describes a career development plan that will enable me to develop expertise in outcome measure development methodology, systematic reviews and meta-analysis, and surgical comparative effectiveness research techniques. The research specific aims are: a) to systematically review the literature on PROMs related to voice, swallowing, and breathing, evaluating their construct and analyzing adequacy of psychometric development; b) to rigorously develop a PROM to assess UVFP-attributable disability using classical test theory principles and to perform principal component analysis to determine its latent dimension structure and scoring; and c) validate the PROM by: performing confirmatory factor analysis and assessing test-retest reliability, alternate administration/form reliability, concurrent criterion-related validity, and construct validity including longitudinal responsiveness to time and intervention. The career development plan integrates: a) advanced coursework and individualized mentor-directed instruction in outcome measure development methodology, systematic review/meta-analysis, and surgical comparative effectiveness techniques, b) participation in local/national seminars and conferences to advance expertise in qualitative and quantitative aspects in development of PROMs in addition to conduct of systematic reviews/meta-analysis and surgical trials, c) a multidisciplinary mentored research experience, and d) a highly supportive research environment. This environment includes the Center for Surgical Quality and Outcomes Research, an AHRQ-funded Evidence-based Practice Center, a NIH-funded Clinical Translation Science Award, a top-ranked Peabody School of Education, a Masters in Public Health program, and the state-of-the- art Bill Wilkerson Center for Otolaryngology and Communication Sciences. Overall, this career development award will advance my career in comparative effectiveness research by providing education in outcome measure development methodology and will yield a rigorously developed and psychometrically valid PROM that comprehensively assesses UVFP-attributable disability. Importantly, this award provides critical support to seamlessly transition toward future independently funded studies that use the newly created PROM to compare UVFP interventions, track recovery, prognosticate, and better tailor management algorithms to minimize UVFP-attributable disability."

We have been focused on the death receptor signaling pathways in regulating apoptosis of cancer cells and their roles in cancer tumorigenesis and resistance to therapy. Our studies have demonstrated that modulating the Death- Inducing Signaling Complex (DISC) determines the downstream survival and apoptosis signals. Recently, we discovered a novel regulator, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1), in the death receptor-5 DISC that contribute to the resistance of pancreatic cancer to therapy, a critical hurdle for effective cancer treatment. Based on this novel finding, our current VA merit review award (2014-2018) is to delineate the mechanisms underlying DISC-associated PARP1 in regulating pancreatic cancer resistance to antibody immunotherapy with a humanized anti-death receptor 5 antibody (TRA-8/CS1008). I will continue my long-term collaboration with VA physician scientist, Jay M McDonald, MD (Pathology, Birmingham VA) and the inventor of TRA-8/CS1008, Tong Zhou, MD (Medicine, UAB). As CS1008 therapy has been effective in clinical trials for some cancer but resistant in others including pancreatic tumors, the overarching goal for our investigations is to elucidate the molecular mechanisms and identify new compounds that sensitize pancreatic cancer to TRA-8-induced apoptosis, thus overriding drug resistance and leading to successful therapies.  Differentiation and reprogramming of vascular smooth muscle cells in vascular disease. Phenotypic plasticity of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) provides an excellent model to study the function of cell differentiation in health and disease. We are particularly interested in studying how VSMC become bone-like cells (vascular calcification). Using tissue-specific gene knockout mouse models, we have demonstrated an essential role of the osteogenic transcription factor Runx2 in regulating vascular calcification, a feature of atherosclerosis, diabetes and end stage renal disease. We have uncovered novel mechanisms underlying Runx2 upregulation in the vasculature by increased oxidative stress and hyperglycemia. We have also discovered a novel crosstalk between VSMC, macrophages and vascular stem cells in the development of atherosclerotic calcification. We have published a body of work demonstrating a critical integrative role of Runx2 upregulation in VSMC in promoting vascular pathology, which has been highly recognized and cited. Our overarching goals are to identify novel mechanisms that regulate pathogenesis of vascular calcification and identify therapeutic targets. We have brought together several physician scientists at the Birmingham VA including Drs. Paul Sanders and Anupam Agarwal (Nephrology) as well as Dr. Louis Dell'Italia (Cardiology and Associate Chief of Staff). Our collaborative studies have led to the development of a Program Project to investigate ?Novel Regulators for Vascular Disease?, which have been supported by the VA (2012-2016).  These investigations will not only elucidate the fundamental molecular mechanisms underlying the regulation of cancer drug resistance and pathogenesis of vascular disease, but also provide novel molecular insights facilitating further studies to translate these findings into therapeutic strategies for patient care, so as to improve the Veterans' health, life span and quality of life."

"9384719","Abstract The 2015-2016 epidemic of Zika virus (ZIKV) has caused severe unexpected clinical outcomes including microcephaly and Guillain-Barre Syndrome. ZIKV is primarily a mosquito-transmitted virus but the concerns regarding sexual transmission has gained urgency as the alarming increase in the number of cases of microcephaly in ZIKV-infected women coincided with the detection of the virus in the semen. Association of ZIKV with hematospermia and presence of infectious ZIKV in the semen when viremia is undetectable in humans suggest the ability of ZIKV to establish infection in the testes. Lack of any vaccine or specific therapeutic drugs to combat ZIKV infection and prevent testicular infection has brought an urgent need for the development of in vitro systems and in vivo models to understand the associated mechanisms. Seminiferous tubules, the site of spermatogenesis within the testes, is an immune privileged site with an effective blood-testes barrier (BTB) that prevents microbial infections and protects immunogenic germ cells from systemic immune attack. The BTB, constituted exclusively by specialized tight junctions proteins (TJP) between the adjacent sertoli cells (SC) provides physical and immunological barrier to the seminiferous tubules. Increased production of inflammatory mediators such as TNF-?, IL-8, matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and cell-adhesion molecules (CAM) has been suggested to disrupt BTB and facilitate testicular infections. Although, compelling data from recent studies suggest that ZIKV has the ability to infect testes that may allow escape from immune detection, little is known about ZIKV infection of the testes. This proposal seeks to determine the mechanisms of ZIKV entry into the testes by utilizing an in vitro BTB model system using primary human SC and in vivo nonhuman primate model. We will address the hypothesis that to remain infectious in the testes even after the virus is cleared from the periphery, ZIKV infects SC and testes macrophages to induce inflammatory response that alters the expression of TJP, leading to BTB disruption and allowing entry of the virus into the seminiferous tubules thus establishing persistent infection in the testes. Our group is uniquely positioned to delineate the mechanisms of ZIKV testicular entry because of our previous experience of utilizing in vitro blood-brain barrier system and in vivo models to study WNV-neuroinvasion mechanisms. The specific aim 1 will determine how cell-free and macrophage-associated ZIKV transmigrates across the human in vitro BTB model and affects the barrier integrity. We will also assess if the induction of inflammatory mediators including cytokines, MMPs and CAM by ZIKV can affect expression of multiple TJP and BTB integrity. Specific Aim 2 will evaluate whether ZIKV affects the BTB integrity in the experimentally infected macaques and determine the relationship with persistence of virus and inflammatory and antiviral response in the testes. It is anticipated that the integration of data from the in vitro human system and highly relevant NHP model will fill the fundamental gap of the mechanism of ZIKV-testes entry and enhance our understanding of the specific immune response to testicular virus infection. Together this information may guide future strategies to manipulate the system for the development of novel approaches to eradicate virus from the testes."
"9386715","Summary The goal of the proposed research is to characterize structures and interactions of receptors residing in plasma membranes, in particular those of immune cells. Membrane bound receptors play important roles in cells but their structures and molecular functions have been difficult to reveal. Importantly, the T-cell plasma membrane contains the T-cell receptor of antigens and the associated CD3 components crucial for signaling. Furthermore, the membrane contains the CD4/8, CCR5 and CXCR4, co-receptors of HIV. There are many other T-cell transmembrane proteins with numerous activities, such as CD2, CD45 or Ca2+ channels. For a number of these systems structures of extracellular or intracellular portions have been characterized in various groups including ours. However, interactions of transmembrane segments have been difficult to access on a structural level due to the complexity of handling membranes. Exceptions include the G-protein coupled receptors CCR5 and CXCR4, or the ? homodimer of the TCR and a model of the TCR transmembrane arrangement based on biochemical experiments and model building. Structures and functional aspects of complexes of T-cell membrane proteins with other proteins residing in other membranes are even more difficult to study but will be tackled here. We recently made a break through designing covalently circularized nanodiscs (cNDs) of variable size, which allows assembly of stable membrane protein complexes in a well defined near-native environment and dramatically facilitates structural studies of integral membrane proteins. Moreover, this approach provides access to structural studies of proteins residing in different membranes. We show preliminary data from non-circularized and circularized nanodisc since the latter was established only recently. It is now fully available and will be applied to the systems described. We will apply this technology in two specific aims:  Aim 1. Characterize the interaction of viral particles with their receptors in circularized nanodiscs. As a proof of concept we will use EM methods to reveal detail of poliovirus interaction with its receptor CD155 in cNDs. This approach will be extended for imaging the interaction of HIV pseudovirus and/or gp160 with its co-receptors and will reveal details of viral engagement and pore formation.  Aim 2: Determine the structure of the TCR/CD3 complex in cNDs and characterize the interaction with pMHC and CD8. Receptors residing in different nanodiscs will be linked with DNA handles to allow formation of cND sandwiches that mimic interactions of receptors from different cells."
"9568361","Prevalence of systolic heart failure (HF) is high among the growing population of older adults1-3. Progressive cardiac remodeling and deteriorating cardiac output have been implicated as key factors underlying HF-related exercise intolerance and quality of life1. Even after implementing medical and device therapies that moderate remodeling, exercise tolerance remains impaired. While exercise training has been demonstrated to improve exercise capacity, mechanisms facilitating this benefit remain unclear. Peripheral adaptations in the skeletal muscle and vasculature provide at least some benefit, however reverse cardiac remodeling (beyond effects of pharmacological and device therapies) may be additive4-6. We propose to study the impact of 2 different types of exercise on cardiac morphology as well as systolic and diastolic performance and related functional gains. We will compare traditional aerobic training to a novel regimen of inspiratory muscle training (IMT). IMT is a specific type of exercise training that may be particularly useful for frail, infirmed HF patients who are unlikely to tolerate aerobic training. Effects of IMT on remodeling have not been previously studied.  The proposed echocardiography pilot study builds on a funded VA Merit F0834-R Exercise Therapy to Reduce Heart Failure Symptoms; Sorting Mechanisms of Benefit (PI, Forman) that compares different modes of exercise training in older (agee50yrs) systolic (EFd40%) HF patients. The original study assesses peripheral mechanisms affected by exercise training, but was not designed to assess cardiac remodeling. The proposed pilot study provides a vital complementary analysis, i.e., it adds assessments of cardiac remodeling as well as related changes in systolic and diastolic performance. Male and female (N=75) systolic HF patients (LVEF d40%) aged e50 years will be studied. Patients will be randomized into one of three groups (IMT [n=30] or aerobic [n=30] or control [n=15]). A comprehensive battery of functional assessments as well as echocardiographic examination will be performed before and after a 12-week, 3x/weekly regimen of aerobic training vs. IMT vs. usual care.  Specific Aims are (1) to analyze exercise training effects on left ventricular structure and function using conventional and novel indices of systolic and diastolic function. We hypothesize that exercise training will decrease left ventricular end-diastolic and end-systolic volumes and increase ejection fraction (EF) as well as regional strain compared to controls. (b) exercise training will increase mitral annular early diastolic velocity (e') as well as decrease the ratio (E/e') of early mitral inflow velocity (E) and e'. (c) IMT will be non-inferior to aerobic training in relation to anti-remodeling benefit and both forms of training will be superior compared to controls. (2). To explore the benefits of improved cardiac remodeling and physiology on functional and qualitative endpoints. We hypothesize (a) that exercise training-related cardiac improvements will lead to improved aerobic functional parameters (peak VO2 and VE/VCO2 slope). (b) that exercise training-related cardiac improvements will lead to improved aerobic functional parameters and improved quality of life (as measured by questionnaires)."

"9378079","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application focuses on the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma brucei, which causes devastating diseases in humans and animals in sub-Saharan Africa. There are no vaccines, and therapeutic drugs have serious side effects and decreasing efficacy. Thus, there is a pressing need for research to better understand the biology of these human pathogens and the mechanisms they use to survive within their hosts. T. brucei undergoes a complex life cycle between the mammalian host and the blood-feeding tsetse fly vector, which among others involves changes in cell morphology, surface coat composition, metabolism, signaling pathways and gene expression. Consequently, these parasites have evolved adaptations to allow for their survival in both the gut and salivary glands of the tsetse fly, as well as in the bloodstream of their mammalian host. By overexpressing a single RNA-binding protein (RBP6) in non- infectious trypanosomes, we recapitulated in vitro the events leading to acquisition of infectivity in the insect vector, including the expression of metacyclic variant surface glycoproteins (mVSGs). At present, little is known how mVSG gene expression is activated and how the expression is switched to bloodstream-form VSGs, once the parasite enters a mammalian host. One major goal of this application will be to examine how trypanosomes receive instructions to begin synthesizing the mVSG coat, how each cell expresses a single mVSG, and how mVSG expression is repressed and switched to the expression of bloodstream-form VSGs. We will apply a number of high-throughput approaches to monitor the chromatin structure of mVSG genes during developmental progression and test whether a second RNA-binding protein (RBP10) is a facilitator of [m]VSG expression. Primary transcripts and mature mRNAs will be monitored using RNA-Seq, the position, amount, and orientation of transcriptionally engaged RNA polymerase I will be surveyed by global run-on-sequencing (GRO-Seq) and transcription factor binding will be gauged by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) coupled with Illumina sequencing (ChIP-Seq). A second emphasis will be on RNA interference (RNAi). Since our discovery of RNAi in T. brucei in 1998, this pathway has been a focus of our investigations, which have led to the finding that RNAi functions both in the nucleus and in the cytoplasm and to the identification of five core RNAi genes. We will employ different approaches to address the question what defines the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), i.e. what other cellular factors functionally interact with the RNAi machinery, and how the levels of Argonaute are regulated. Finally, we will further address the biological function of RNAi by determining the RNAi targets during the T. brucei developmental cycle, which is now possible with our newly developed differentiation system."
"9392494","Currently, over 230,000 total hip arthroplasties (THA) are performed each year in the United States to alleviate pain and disability associated with osteoarthritis (OA). However, full recovery of muscle strength and function after hip arthroplasty remains a major challenge. A major factor influencing full recovery of physical function is the presence of chronic movement compensations, which may be the biggest rehabilitative challenge after THA. These movement compensations reflect failure to fully remediate strength losses resulting from hip OA and THA as well as a failure to integrate muscle strength gains into functional movement. Functional strength integration during performance of functional tasks refers to the ability of the body to produce stable, coordinated movements. Around the hip joint, optimal functional strength integration is largely dependent on the ability of hip abductor muscles to produce hip abduction moments, which stabilize the pelvis during unilateral stance tasks. Thus, inability to integrate hip abductor strength during functional tasks leads to lower hip abduction moments during functional tasks, resulting in poor pelvic stability and movement compensations. This lack of functional strength integration possibly explains lingering deficits in functional recovery after THA. However, current rehabilitation practices do not target the integration of strength and functional movement to resolve movement compensations for improved physical function.  A rehabilitation program emphasizing functional strength integration after THA has the potential to substantially improve postoperative physical function by improving movement compensations with greater hip abductor strength and recruitment during function, providing greater pelvic control and movement quality. Therefore, the proposed investigation involves a randomized controlled trial to determine if an 8-week functional strength integration (FSI) program improves physical function and muscle performance more than control intervention (CON) in Veterans undergoing unilateral THA. The secondary goal is to determine if FSI improves movement compensations during functional activity (walking and stair climbing). Functional and biomechanical outcomes will be assessed pre-operatively (PRE) and at three postoperative time points: intervention mid-point, 4 weeks (POST1), intervention end-point, 8 weeks (POST2) (primary endpoint) and late recovery, 26 weeks (POST3)."
"9378786","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Emerging evidence indicates that several mammalian C-type lectin receptors (CLRs) in innate immune cells function as pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) for sensing fungal infections, and trigger multiple signaling cascades leading to expression of various pro- inflammatory cytokines and anti-microbial proteins. In our previous studies, we have found that Dectin-2 and Dectin-3, two CLRs, form a heterodimeric complex on innate immune cells and function as a PRR for sensing fungal infection. Although many studies have been focused on characterizing the activation event of CLR signaling in response to fungal infection, it is not very clear whether CLR proteins and their signaling are negatively regulated i response to fungal infection. In our preliminary studies, we have revealed two important aspects of negative regulation of CLR signaling. First, we found that Dectin-2 and Dectin-3, two CLRs involved in sensing fungal infection, were rapidly downregulated in macrophages following fungal challenging, and this downregulation is triggered by signal-induced ubiquitination through a Cbl- b-dependent mechanism, and the ubiquitinated Dectin-2/Dectin-3 appears to be degraded through a lysosome-mediated process. Second, we found that stimulation of Dectin-2/Dectin-3 can effectively induce JNK activation, but instead of playing a positive role, JNK1 activation negatively regulates CLR-induced CD23 expression that is involved in modulating anti-fungal immune response. Therefore, based on our compelling and exciting preliminary data, we propose 1) to determine the molecular mechanism by which Cbl-b regulates the degradation of Dectin-2/Dectin-3 in response to fungal infection; and 2) to characterize the molecular mechanism by which JNK1 is negatively involved in anti-fungal immune responses. Together, these lines of investigation will characterize two important mechanisms that negatively regulate host innate immune system against fungal infection, and will provide the molecular insight for designing novel therapeutic agents by modulating host innate immune system against fungal infection."
"9395020","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is a multifactorial disease characterized by progression to heart failure and increased morbidity despite existing therapies. Chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH) is a distinct subtype of PH characterized by diffuse in situ thromboembolic vascular remodeling of pulmonary arterioles. Current concepts regarding the pathophysiology of CTEPH include contributions of hyperactive coagulation, insufficient anticoagulation, and impaired thrombus resolution. However, no unifying mechanism has been identified to explain the concomitant diffuse arteriopathy observed in areas not implicated as the site of initial vascular injury. Based on preliminary data from the Maron Pulmonary Vascular Research Laboratory, the Cas-L protein, NEDD9, has emerged as an unanticipated mediator of thrombosis and vascular fibrosis in human pulmonary artery endothelial cells in vitro and in both rodent models of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) and patients afflicted with PAH in vivo. We hypothesize that NEDD9 contributes to both (1) the thrombogenic pathophenotype in CTEPH by disrupting the homeostasis between thrombosis and fibrinolysis resulting in increased platelet-endothelial cell adhesion and (2) the angioproliferation and vascular fibrosis observed in CTEPH by promoting cell proliferation and collagen deposition. The purpose of this proposal is to use cell biology and proteomics to determine the mechanism by which NEDD9 contributes to endothelial dysfunction and cell proliferation in vitro and clinically translate these findings by studying blood, endothelial cells, and surgically extracted thromboemboli from CTEPH patients. As part of the research training program, the principal investigator will learn to use conventional methods in cell biology, proteomics, and transgenic murine models, and obtain a Certificate in Applied Biostatistics through Harvard Catalyst. This research project will be performed under the guidance of well-established investigators in pulmonary vascular disease with additional advice from experts in vascular biology and PH."
"9378718","My research focus is on Veterans who have been diagnosed with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), a war- related illness. I was among the first to document hostility, violence and anger among individuals (both men and women) with PTSD. I was also among the first researchers to observe that individuals with PTSD self-report and are diagnosed with more physical health problems, including cardiovascular disorders. This work has led to several significant contributions in understanding the behavioral and psychophysiological mechanisms that may contribute to increased risk of poor health among persons with PTSD, including that individuals with PTSD have higher ambulatory heart rate and blood pressure, lower baroreceptor sensitivity, and lower heart rate variability. I have shown that individuals with PTSD have reduced sleep duration and sleep efficiency, which may lead to reduced levels of ambulatory heart rate variability, and that these effects occur early in the trajectory of those who develop PTSD. I have investigated mechanisms that may explain the association between increased prevalence and higher nicotine dependence in smokers with PTSD. I evaluated the effect of nicotine and smoking behavior on prepulse inhibition as well as acoustic startle among smokers with and without PTSD. My research has shown that smokers with PTSD experience higher craving and negative affect in response to trauma cues, that smoking cigarettes with or without nicotine reduces symptoms, but the ameliorative effect is short lived, and that emotional reactivity to trauma stimuli is related to a shorter time to smoking relapse. I have developed a novel mobile health intervention that has shown tremendous promise toward reducing smoking among those with PTSD and other psychiatric disorders. I have worked with my colleagues to demonstrate that global positioning monitoring may be ultimately useful in intervening with smokers. I am currently expanding the evaluation of mobile health approaches in a NIH-funded treatment development grant for smokers with schizophrenia and a merit review-funded randomized clinical trial in homeless smokers. My mentees and I have several grant applications under review to extend this work to changing two behavioral targets simultaneously (e.g., quitting alcohol and smoking cigarettes; quitting smoking and increasing physical activity; and quitting smoking tobacco and marijuana). Each of these approaches may help Veterans with key health problems. Because of my expertise in PTSD mechanisms and experience with developing registries, I was invited to lead the Genetics Laboratory of the VA VISN 6 Mental Illness Research, Education, and Clinical Center in 2006, and I have served in that role since the inception of the VISN 6 MIRECC. The current registry has collected DNA and RNA among nearly 4,000 returning Veterans. My team and I have published a genome-wide association study (GWAS) with PTSD cases and non-cases, and evaluated several candidate genes in PTSD. I have also represented the MIRECC in the national PTSD Genetics Consortium, and the MIRECC samples have been included in a very large scale Consortium GWAS manuscript (more than 21,000 total samples) and a methylation manuscript. After collecting, extracting, and generating data over the past 10 years, we are currently excited to evaluate methylation and gene expression in the MIRECC sample as well as participate in the meta-analyses associated with the Consortium. I have recently been approved to serve as the Durham VAMC site PI for the VA Million Veteran Project (MVP), and this should lead to additional productive collaborations between the MIRECC Genetics Core and MVP-related projects focused on PTSD and substance abuse. I will continue my research program on PTSD and co-morbid conditions."
"9378778","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Members of the genus Flaviviruses, such as West Nile, Japanese encephalitis, tick-borne encephalitis, yellow fever, and dengue virus, are human pathogens that cause significant morbidity and mortality in ever-widening geographic areas of the world. Currently, there are few vaccines and no available efficacious antiviral therapies for flaviviruses. A Mendelian dominant allele of the Flv gene that was first discovered in mice in the 1920's reduces the replication efficiency of all members of the genus Flavivirus so far tested and confers resistance to flavivirus-induced disease. Resistant mice display no symptoms even after an intracerebral injection of a flavivirus dose that kills 100% of congenic susceptible mice. Viral attachment and entry are not blocked but intracellular viral RNA levels and extracellular virus production are reduced in resistant cells. The Flv locus was subsequently identified as the Oas1b gene. Susceptible mice express a truncated Oas1b protein due to the presence of a premature stop codon. Replacement of the susceptible Oas1b allele by knock-in of the Oas1b resistance allele using targeted homologous recombination converted susceptible C57BL/6 mice to the resistant phenotype. Oas1b is a member of the 2-5A synthetase family but the products of both alleles of this gene are inactive synthetases. The unique flavivirus-specific antiviral activity of Oas1b is not dependent on the canonical RNase L pathway. The recent identification of cell partners for Oas1b has provided new directions for gaining an understanding of this novel, natural, flavivirus-specific antiviral mechanism. Preliminary data for one of the Oas1b binding partners, ABCF3, indicate that it is specifically involved in the flavivirus-resistance mechanism and that it may also be involved in regulating the canonical Oas-RNase L pathway. Functional contributions of the Oas1b binding partners to the flavivirus-specific resistance phenotype and for one of the partners, a contribution to a broad spectrum antiviral pathway will be studied under three specific aims. Aim 1: Characterization of the resistance phenotype in various types of cell cultures and functional analyses of the involvement of Oas1b partner proteins in the flavivirus resistance mechanism. Aim 2: Characterization of the resistance phenotype in mouse brains and analysis of the requirement of ABCF3 for the Oas1b-mediated, flavivirus-specific resistance phenotype in mice. Aim 3: Functional analysis of the interaction of ABCF3 with the active 2-5A synthetase Oas1a. This project will provide new knowledge about a novel, naturally-occurring, genetically-controlled, flavivirus-specific disease resistance mechanism in mice as well as reveal new information about the unique step in the flavivirus replication cycle that is affected by this resistance mechanism. This information is expected to identify new cell targets for the development of pan-flavivirus antiviral therapeutics. New insights about the regulation of the Oas-RNase L pathway will also be obtained."
"9385282","Defining the role of Host Hsp70 Subnetworks in Dengue Virus Replication Abstract: Viral protein folding and homeostasis depends entirely on the machinery of the host cell. Here we define the dependence of Dengue virus (DENV) on the complex network of Hsp70 chaperones and cochaperones which mediate distinct steps of the virus life cycle. We find that several cytosolic Hsp70 isoforms are required at multiple steps of the viral life cycle to prevent viral protein degradation, promote virion assembly and support viral enzyme function. At each step, Hsp70 function is specified by distinct subnetworks of cofactors, called DnaJs and NEFs, that modulate Hsp70 action and localization at each step. We hypothesize that combinations of DnaJs and NEFs dictate the specific cellular locations, substrate specificities and downstream effectors of Hsp70 in viral replication. We propose to define the mechanism and function of Hsp70 subnetworks in DENV replication through the integration of genetic and proteomic analyses with biochemical and cell biological experiments. Specifically we propose to: (1) Define the mechanism and function of DnaJs in DENV replication; (2) Dissect the role and mechanism of Hsp70 NEFs in DENV replication and (3) Define the mechanism of restriction by the Bag6-centered network. Defining the chaperone subnetworks required for distinct steps of DENV replication will provide new insights into key aspects of the cell biology and molecular mechanism of viral infection. Importantly, Hsp70 provides a susceptible node for antiviral drugs, since compounds inhibiting the Hsp70 cycle blocks DENV infection with negligible toxicity to the host. Our work will thus identify novel targets for pharmacological antiviral intervention and uncover unanticipated cellular mechanisms for viral restriction."
"9377531","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There exists a great need to understand how the human herpesvirus Varicella zoster Virus (VZV) interacts with neurons. The sensory neuron is critical to successful VZV pathogenesis as the site of a decades-long state of persistence, and the source for VZV reactivation to cause Herpes zoster. This painful and debilitating disease is encountered by a third of adults, and is frequently complicated by chronic pain and neurological problems. Furthermore, ophthalmic zoster is a potentially devastating infectious disease that causes significant vision loss and a much greater toll than zoster elsewhere in terms of pain, complications and marked disruption of the quality of life. Even if all eligible persons received the zoster vaccine (which is far from being achieved). the partial effectiveness would still result in some half of a million zoster cases annually. What we know of VZV latency and reactivation has remained enigmatic, controversial and unclear, because most animal models or their neurological tissues do not support VZV replication or reactivation. Indeed, VZV experimental reactivation has proved exceedingly difficult under any circumstances. Yet, if neuronal infection, spread, persistence or reactivation can be prevented, disease could be more easily controlled. We now have an unprecedented cultured human neuron platform, derived from human embryonic stem cells, that supports not only VZV productive infection, but also persistent states that can now be reactivated. Our overlying hypothesis is that this system will enable us to address aspects of neuron infection, latency and qreactivation in a manner that has not been previously possible. Our first aim will test the hypothesis that specific VZV proteins are required for neuron axonal infection, replication, inter-neuronal spread or anterograde axonal return. We will evaluate fluorescent reporter VZV with gene deletions for each stage of neuronal infection to identify those proteins required. Such proteins could be not only be targeted in strategies to block latency and reactivation, but such VZV mutants could be the basis for improved vaccines with defined deficiencies in neurotropism. Our second aim will address the viral transcription program during VZV persistence and reactivation. We will then identify what transcription occurs during persistence and reactivation, including a search for small RNAs that may contribute to latency. We will also address if transcriptional programs differ following reactivation at differen temperatures. Our third aim will test the hypothesis that the persistent VZV genome can be targeted by large sequence recognition nucleases, in order to reduce VZV latent genomic loads or prevent reactivation. This would establish principles or targeting the latent VZV genome without reliance on viral gene products.

While the underlying etiology and pathophysiology remain unclear for majority of the human cases, it has become increasingly clear that early neurodevelopmental defects can be a contributor to behavioral sequelae later in life. Recently, neural progenitor proliferation and differentiation abnormalities have been described in mouse models of human neuropsychiatric disorders. The postnatal rodent subventricular zone (SVZ) niche around the lateral brain ventricles is a specialized environment housing GFAP+ astrocytes functioning as neural stem cells (NSCs), producing mainly GABAergic interneurons. Postnatal SVZ neurogenesis is regulated by NSC-intrinsic mechanisms, interacting with extracellular/niche-driven cues. It is generally believed that these local effects are responsible for sustaining neurogenesis, though behavioral paradigms and disease states have pointed to possibilities for higher-level modulation. It is currently unclear if activity states from groups of neurons, or discrete neural circuits can directly control postnatal SVZ neurogenesis. We have identified acetylcholine (ACh) release by neuronal terminals into the SVZ niche. Our preliminary results have uncovered a previously undescribed population of cholinergic neurons, projecting their processes directly onto SVZ NSCs. Optogenetic stimulation or inhibition of these novel cholinergic neurons resulted in measurable electrical current induction in SVZ NSCs and concurrent changes in the rates of neurogenesis. We plan to further explore these observations by determining the following: 1) which higher-level brain regions provide excitatory drive to induce ACh release in the SVZ; 2) what are the molecular mechanisms required in SVZ NSCs downstream of ACh activation to promote neurogenesis; and 3) which are the SVZ niche cellular structures/organizations that can transform neuronal firing frequencies into NSC proliferation and increased neurogenesis. Our study proposes to explore a direct connection between neuronal activity from cholinergic neurons and postnatal SVZ NSC proliferation. To make this research question tractable, we have developed new mouse reagents, as well as optogenetic and live-imaging platforms to directly measure the interactions between neuronal activity patterns and SVZ neurogenesis. We believe these findings will have a positive impact by vertically advancing our functional understanding of postnatal SVZ neurogenesis control by circuit-level activity, with potentially important implications for cholinergic circuit dysfunctionin neuropsychiatric diseases."
"9379849","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Type I interferon (IFN) production by plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDC) and increased expression of IFN-? inducible genes are argued to be central to the pathogenesis of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). The type I IFN gene signature is associated with more severe disease in SLE and several other systemic and organ- specific autoimmune diseases. This suggests that there are significant disease subgroups in which less severe disease may be due to type I IFN independent mechanisms. The scarcity of experimental data on the mechanisms of type I IFN independent autoimmunity is a significant barrier to our understanding of the totality of the autoimmune disease process and its treatment. Our studies of the systemic autoimmunity resulting from exposure to mercury reveal the mild disease in this model to be independent of type I IFN. Mercury exposure in humans also results in a mild expression of systemic autoimmunity. Less fulminant systemic disease has also been observed with other xenobiotics and drugs. Thus mercury-induced autoimmunity may offer a suitable animal model to study type I IFN independent autoimmunity, the mechanisms of which may be applicable to multiple environmental agents. Based on our preliminary studies we hypothesize that in type I IFN independent autoimmunity innate immune responses are mediated by endosomal TLRs via NF-?B activation leading to proinflammatory cytokine production and NF-?B dependent synergy with IFN-? resulting in enhanced expression of IFN-? induced genes. We propose to address this hypothesis in four specific aims:- Aim 1) Are dendritic cells (DCs) essential for type I IFN independent autoimmunity?, Aim 2) Do endosomal Toll-like Receptor (TLR) signaling pathways mediate type I IFN-independent autoimmunity?, Aim 3) Is proinflammatory cytokine expression in type I IFN independent autoimmunity regulated by NF-?B?, and Aim 4) Is proinflammatory IL-1? required for IFN-? dependence of type I IFN independent autoimmunity? Answers to these questions will provide insight into the multiplicity of pathogenic pathways leading to systemic autoimmunity and broaden the conceptual foundation upon which autoimmune disease research is based."
"9378106","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Exposure to air pollution is associated with adverse health outcomes and people with pre- existing cardiovascular or respiratory disease are more susceptible. In particular, exposure to ozone is associated with exacerbations of asthma. There is also evidence from several studies that exposure to ozone is associated with the development of asthma, though these findings are not always consistent. Gene-environment interactions (GxE) have been proposed as an explanation for the inconsistency of the ozone -to-asthma association across studies. The investigators submit that by identifying these GxE in a mouse model of ozone-induced allergic airway disease (AAD) using an unbiased, genome-wide approach they can gain insight into the mechanisms by which ozone affects pulmonary and immune responses in the lung. To identify these GxE, the investigators will leverage a new mouse genetics resource, the Collaborative Cross (CC). The CC consists of a panel of recombinant inbred lines derived from eight-way crosses using a diverse set of inbred strains and provides ideal features for studying GxE and identifying the underlying molecular processes. Based on prior studies showing that ozone primes the immune system towards an allergy-prone phenotype, the investigators have designed a study in which mice are first exposed to ozone (or filtered air), and then are subjected to house dust mite (HDM) allergen sensitization and challenge (ozone-to-HDM) through the airway. In Aim 1, the investigators will characterize population level variation and heritability of AAD phenotypes in response to ozone-to-HDM among 100 CC lines. Based on this distribution, they will identify strains that have extreme responses (high and low) to ozone-to-HDM. These strains will be used in Aim 2 to test whether responses to ozone alone (neutrophilia and airway hyper-responsiveness) predict response to ozone-to-HDM and whether known effects of ozone on several immune parameters (macrophage, CD4+ T-cell, and dendritic cell number and activation status) are correlated with response to ozone-to-HDM. In Aim 3, the investigators will identify novel genetic and genomic predictors of response to ozone-to-HDM using genome- wide approaches. Specifically, they will measure lung gene expression using RNA-sequencing, and identify quantitative trait locus (QTL) and gene expression QTL (eQTL). Finally, by merging the QTL and eQTL data, the investigators will identify candidate genes for QTL using advanced statistical modeling and bioinformatic approaches. In summary, this grant application utilizes innovative and yet feasible approaches to identify genes and pathways that mediate the effect of ozone on subsequent response to allergen, and the results will offer new avenues of research into the health effects of ozone."
"9378779","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Human V?9V?2  T cells are the major subset of ?? T cells that are found in human blood, comprising up to 5% of the T cells in healthy individuals and expanding to 20-50% during infection or disease. These cells play important roles in mediating immunity against microbial pathogens, including Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Mycobacterium leprae (the causative agents of tuberculosis and leprosy, respectively), and can respond potently against certain types of tumor cells. V?9V?2 T cells respond to these threats through recognition of structurally related non-peptidic phosphorylated antigens (pAgs). In tumor cells these are intermediate metabolites that accumulate due to over-production of the mevalonate pathway and in microbes they are generated during isoprenoid biosynthesis. It is largely unknown how V?9V?2 T cells recognize these pAgs; this proposal seeks to improve our overall understanding of the mechanisms behind V?9V?2 T cell activation and improve our ability to modulate this population in clinical settings. These cells also represent a prime opportunity to study alternative recognition strategies by ?? T cells, as classical and most no-classical MHC molecules do not appear to be involved in the recognition process. Our collaborators were the first to define the role of the BTN3A molecules in pAg-mediated V?9V?2 T cell stimulation and we have since then demonstrated the intracellular domain of one on them, BTN3A1, is the molecular sensor for pAg accumulation. We seek to understand the events that occur after pAg binding in our Aim1: To determine the direct molecular consequences of pAg binding to the BTN3A1 B30.2 intracellular domain. by using structural and dynamic studies including crystallography, NMR and fluorescence based measurements (FRET). In our Aim 2. To determine the supra-molecular organization of BTN3A1 molecules in the plasma membrane upon pAg or 20.1 mAb binding and its role in V?9V?2 T cell activation, we will use FRET based approaches, microscopy and protein engineering to study the factors that mediate cell surface assembly of BTN3A molecules. Finally, we will employ cross-linking and pull-downs combined with a SILAC-based mass spectrometry approach, complemented with a high-throughput genome-wide knockdown screen to pursue our Aim 3. From BTN3A1 to the V?9V?2 TCR: discovery of the relevant molecular players linking BTN3A1 to V?9V?2 T cell activation, which will define the other molecular players that are involved in pAg recognition in inducing the signals that directly lead to V?9V?2 T cell activation."
"9389463","Abstract A person, usually a child, dies of rabies every nine minutes globally. Current rabies virus (RABV) post- exposure prophylaxis (PEP) remains complicated and costly, requiring four to five doses of inactivated RABV- based vaccine plus rabies immune globulin (RIG). A single-dose vaccine that does not require expensive and often unavailable RIG would greatly increase the efficacy of RABV vaccination, reduce the cost associated with rabies prevention, and save lives. However, there is a gap in our understanding of how B cells are activated in response to RABV-based vaccination. For the last 35 years, B cells secreting IgG (but not IgM) were thought to be solely responsible for vaccine-induced protection against RABV infection via T cell-dependent responses in post-exposure settings. Furthermore, mechanisms by which B cells acquire RABV antigen were not previously known. Our laboratory has begun to unravel key attributes of rabies-specific B cell responses that contribute to the rapid induction of vaccine-induced virus neutralizing antibodies (VNAs). We showed that vaccine-induced T cell-independent (TI) and early extrafollicular T cell-dependent (TD) B cell responses, including neutralizing IgM, can limit dissemination of pathogenic RABV into the CNS, providing partial protection in mice. We also showed that free rabies particles migrate to subcapsular sinus macrophages in the draining lymph node, transferring RABV antigen directly to B cells. We aim to exploit these findings to develop a single-dose RABV vaccine regimen. Specifically, we hypothesize that a replication-deficient, matrix gene-deleted RABV-based vaccine (RABV-?M) with enhanced tropism to follicular B cells will result in antigen-specific B cells rapidly differentiating into IgM and IgG plasma cells, thereby increasing the kinetics, magnitude and quality of early B cell responses. In this proposal, our goals are to clone, recover and characterize RABV-?M-based vaccines with enhanced tropism to follicular B cells. Next, the new vaccines will be tested in well-described mouse models of rabies immunogenicity and post-exposure protection. Finally, we will confirm that the genetic modifications introduced into RABV-?M do not adversely affect safety and stability. In addition to expanding our knowledge of RABV immunity, key insights will be gained regarding how viral vaccines interact with and activate follicular B cells to induce rapid and potent immunity against viral infections. The major milestone at the completion of this project is the identification of a safe vaccination regimen that induces potent and rapid TI and extrafollicular TD B cell responses more effectively than the multi-dose human rabies vaccine, without the need for RIG. In summary, single-dose vaccine strategies capable of eliciting rapid and robust B cell responses will improve the efficacy of human rabies vaccines, reduce the cost associated with rabies prevention and save lives."
"9390762","Hantaviruses (HVs) predominantly infect the endothelial cell (EC) lining of capillaries and nonlytically cause vascular leakage. Andes virus (ANDV) and Sin Nombre virus (SNV) infect virtually all pulmonary ECs(109) and cause 35% fatal acute pulmonary edema (HV pulmonary syndrome-HPS). However, ANDV is the only HV spread person to person and the only HV that causes lethal HPS-like disease in hamsters. Pathogenic HVs regulate early innate immune responses in order to successfully replicate in ECs and we recently revealed that ANDV contains an additional interferon (IFN) regulating determinant that explains unique ANDV spread and virulence and is a potential target for attenuating ANDV.  HVs are inhibited by IFN added prior to or early after infection, and in order to replicate in human ECs pathogenic HVs regulate early IFN induction. Nonpathogenic PHV, fails to regulate IFN induction or replicate in human ECs, and failed IFN regulation explains why PHV is not a human pathogen. Except for PHV, HV Gn proteins contain cytoplasmic tail (GnT) elements that inhibit RIG-I/TBK1 directed IRF3 phosphorylation and IFN? induction. In contrast, N proteins from TULV, SNV, NY-1V, HTNV and PHV fail to inhibit RIG-I/TBK1 directed IFN induction. Unpredictably, the ANDV N protein inhibited RIGI/TBK1 directed IFN induction. In contrast, N protein from a nonpathogenic S. American HV, MAPV, failed to inhibit IFN signaling, yet MAPV N differs by only 12 dissimilar residues from ANDV N.  ANDV N protein inhibits TBK1 autophosphorylation that is required for TBK1 phosphorylation of IRF3 and our recent proteomics screen found that ANDV N binds a single IFN regulating protein in ECs, TRIM21. Reciprocal TRIM21 IPs validated ANDV N, but not TULV N, as a TRIM21 binding partner. Preliminary data indicates that mutating ANDV residues to MAPV N residues prevents IFN regulation and TRIM21 binding, and provides a mechanism for attenuating ANDV. Our findings suggest that IFN regulation by the ANDV N protein is a novel virulence determinant. This may explain why ANDV uniquely causes viremia and lethal HPS disease in Syrian hamsters and why ANDV is the only HV spread from person to person. These findings permit us to propose defining the role of N and Gn directed IFN regulation in attenuating ANDV and preventing lethal HPS in Syrian hamsters. We define mechanisms by which N and Gn proteins inhibit RIG-I/TBK1 signaling pathways and identify mutations that abolish regulation. We evaluate ANDV reassortants and mutants for attenuation in a lethal Syrian hamster HPS disease model.  We define HV virulence determinants by identifying N/Gn residues of ANDV, MAPV & SNV required to regulate RIG-I/TBK1/IRF3 signaling pathways. We analyze ANDV regulation of IFN inductionin ECs, ANDV N regulation of TRIM21, and N/Gn synergy in IFN regulation. ANDV/MAPV reassortants and N/Gn-?IFN rANDV mutants are evaluated for their attenuation and ability to protect Syrian hamsters from Wt ANDV infection."
"9312122","Our long-term goal is to provide clinicians with a theoretical framework of mobility and framework-derived measurement tools to improve rehabilitation of persons who have mobility restrictions consequent to a stroke. Recovery of mobility from stroke requires restoration of independent muscle excitation from the mass extension and flexion muscle co-activation commonly observed post-stroke. The basis of the theoretical framework used in this study is to delineate the relationship between lesion damage to ipsi- and contra-lesional corticospinal tract and cortico-recticular pathway and muscle co-excitation impairment and the limitations in the execution of the biomechanical functions needed in mobility (e.g., body support and forward propulsion). In past projects where self-selected walking was studied, healthy persons were found to use a small set (n=4) of independent muscle co-excitation patterns to execute the critical biomechanical functions. Persons after stroke walk slower with suboptimal execution of the biomechanical functions because they cannot activate the patterns independently; instead they merge the patterns. The aim of this project is to assess the limits of mobility capability of healthy and post-stroke persons within this framework by having them perform a variety of tasks fundamental to household and community walking, such as how fast they can initiate or stop walking: speed up or slow down, or turn. Experimental analyses of each task will determine how the number, muscle composition and neural control (timing and magnitude) of the independent muscle co-excitation patterns limit body support, body forward propulsion, body mediolateral control, leg propulsion, foot clearance, and muscle mechanical energy production. Across the different mobility tasks, we expect the merging of the late stance pattern (e.g., plantarflexors) with the early stance pattern (e.g., hip and knee extensors) into a stance pattern will be one primary coordination impairment because their contributions to body support and propulsion then conflict at times or are wrongly timed. Another primary coordination impairment expected is the merging of the swing-to-stance pattern (e.g., hamstrings) into the early stance pattern such that leg deceleration at the end of a step cannot be independently controlled. In future projects the relationships found here delineating how muscle coordination impairment limits biomechanical function execution will be used to create a clinical assessment and decision-making ?toolbox? capable of inferring patient-specific deficits in muscle coordination and biomechanical function execution, and their impact on limiting household and community walking. Thus, clinicians will be able to guide individual treatment and monitor individual rehabilitation progress."
"9520606","Vascular complications due to diabetes mellitus (DM) are the result of sustained vascular injury with insufficient vascular repair. In chronic diabetes, vascular reparative mechanism can be lost resulting in development of microvascular complications (MVC), such as diabetic retinopathy (DR). We assessed the reparative function of progenitor cells that circulate in the peripheral blood of diabetic individuals and found that the vascular wall-derived progenitor cells, endothelial colony forming cells (ECFCs), were depleted in diabetics with MVC. Bone marrow- derived progenitor cells, CD45+CD34+ were dysfunctional in diabetics with MVC. We found that human inducible pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs)-derived ECFCs displayed the ability to form functional and durable blood vessels in vivo and conferred therapeutic revascularization by connecting with and remaining integrated with host rodent vessels long term. We characterized a mesoderm subset (SSEA5-KNA+ cells) generated from hiPSCs that gives rise to ECFCs. Finally, we used hiPSCs to generate CD34+CD45+ cells and tested the impact of co- administration of these cells with ECFCs within the vitreous. The addition of CD34+CD45+ cells with ECFCs resulted in the enhanced survival, function and reparative ability of the ECFCs. This beneficial effect was mediated by reducing retinal oxidative stress and inflammation.  These novel and paradigm shifting findings led us to hypothesize: the hiPSC-derived- mesoderm subset (SSEA5-KNA+) can be utilized for long term revascularization of vasodegenerative capillaries and their reparative action can be further enhanced by coinjection of CD34+CD45+ cells that provide anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory effects.  Three aims will test this hypothesis: Aim1: To determine whether hiPSC-derived SSEA5- KNA+ cells generated from either healthy donors or diabetic donors can give rise to ECFCs and pericytes to repair retinal vessels in mouse models of DR. Aim 2: To generate CD34+CD45+ cells from diabetic or control iPSCs and examine whether they enhance the function of SSEA5- KNA+ cells when co-injected into mouse models of DR. Aim 3: Our hypothesis predicts that hiPSC-derived SSEA5-KNA+ cells and CD34+CD45+ cells in combination can optimally support vascular repair in a Western diet-induced type 2 diabetic primate model of DR. The outcome of this work will provide a paradigm-changing approach for autologous cell therapy by optimizing the use of hiPSC-derived cells to enable highly efficient production of vascular cells for tissue/organ-based vascular repair. !"
"9588862","Summary. Dysregulation of PTEN and MKP-1/DUSP1 by changes in expression/degradation, mutation, and/or post-translational modifications (PTMs) contribute to the progression of human diseases such as different cancers. MKP-1 (aka DUSP1) and PTEN are major negative regulatory phosphatase enzymes in the MAPK and PI3K/AKT cell signaling pathways, and both enzymes are subject to PTMs mapped to their C- terminal tails. MKP-1 is phosphorylated twice at positions 359 and 364, whereas PTEN is tetra-phosphorylated at positions 380, 382, 383, and 385 and acetylated at position 402 but there are large gaps in our understanding of the structural and functional impacts of these PTMs. Therefore, our goal is to elucidate the molecular basis for the PTM-dependent regulation of PTEN and MKP-1. Key to our proposal is the generation of semi-synthetic enzymes by expressed protein ligation that facilitates site-specific and stoichiometric insertion of the corresponding PTM(s) and their mimics to be use in these three specific aims: Specific aim 1 will determine the structural basis for the phosphorylation-dependent conformational closure of PTEN. Direct atomic interactions for the phosphorylated C-terminal tail with the PTEN body will be mapped by UV-induced photocrosslinking, which will contribute to a computational model that defines the position of the C-terminal tail when in the closed conformational state. The computational model will be tested by generating site-directed mutants and evaluating them with a series of biochemical assays, including enzyme activity, sensitivity to dephosphorylation by alkaline phosphatase, and lipid binding. Specific aim 2 utilizes a series of biochemical and cellular techniques to define the function of C-terminal (Lys402) acetylation of PTEN. This aim concerns the role of Lys402 acetylation in modulating PTEN's biochemical and cellular function(s) by elucidating its role in regulating enzyme activity, protein-protein interactions, subcellular localization, protein stability, and regulation of different signaling pathways. A series of biochemical and cellular methods will be executed to systematically define the regulatory role that this PTM has on PTEN's cellular function. Specific aim 3 employs a systematic approach to evaluate the role C-terminal phosphorylation has on the biochemical and cellular function of MKP-1. This aim seeks to define the biochemical and/or cellular consequences for these phosphorylation events with respect to enzyme activity, protein-protein interactions, subcellular localization, protein stability, and regulation of different signaling pathways. A series of biochemical and cellular assays will be employed to define how C-terminal phosphorylation regulates MKP-1 function. We anticipate discovering unique regulatory mechanisms for these PTMs that can pave the way to a deeper understanding of cell signaling and next generation therapies."

Typhimurium infection in mice. PPAR?, a transcriptional factor that plays a role in regulating metabolic and immune pathways, is specifically upregulated in Salmonella- infected macrophages. Importantly, PPAR?-deficient mice are not chronically infected with S. Typhimurium. The long-term goal of this research proposal is to understand how S. Typhimurium usurps and manipulates host metabolic and immune activities during chronic infection. In Aim 1, we will use genetic and biochemical approaches to identify mechanisms of Salmonella-dependent activation of PPAR?. In Aim 2, we will identify the PPAR?-dependent immune and metabolic pathways required for Salmonella replication in macrophages. In Aim 3, we will use germ-free mice and mice deficient for PPAR? in macrophages or gut epithelial cells to characterize PPAR?-dependent mechanisms of Salmonella persistence in the gastrointestinal tract. These studies are aimed at gaining a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms of host-pathogen interactions during chronic infections, which will lead to the rational design of therapeutics that will benefit public health."
"9393822","Project Summary  Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) account for one of every three deaths in the United States and are ranked as the leading cause of mortality worldwide. While significant effort has been directed towards elucidating the mechanisms governing the initiation and progression of CVD, much remains unclear. High density lipoprotein (HDL) is regarded to be protective against CVD due to its many anti-atherogenic properties, such as removing excess cholesterol from cells, preventing inflammation, and preventing cell death. Current evidence suggests that the risk for CVD depends more on HDL particle functionality, rather than HDL- cholesterol (HDL-C) levels.  Risk factors for CVD including obesity, hypercholesterolemia, and hypertension increase oxidative stress and the formation of lipid dicarbonyls. Oxidative stress generates isolevuglandins (isoLGs), a family of high reactive lipid dicarbonyls that react with lysine residues of proteins and headgroups of phosphatidylethanolamines (PEs). Importantly, isoLG adduct levels are elevated in atherosclerosis, and correlate with CVD risk more strongly than low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and cholesterol levels. Interestingly, these isoLG adducts are not associated with LDL to a significant degree, raising the possibility that isoLG preferentially modifies HDL and impairs its anti-atherogenic functions. Given the many important functions of HDL, determining the consequences of isoLG modification on HDL structure, composition, and function is imperative for developing novel therapeutics to protect against atherosclerosis.  My research plan will utilize a combination of structural biology, mass spectrometry, in vitro and in vivo approaches, and small molecule scavengers to: i) determine the functional consequences of isoLG modification on HDL subpopulations; ii) define the specific localization of isoLG adducts on HDL structural proteins; iii) determine the specific component of HDL (protein versus lipid) that is responsible for inflammation; iv) test the efficacy of isoLG scavengers in reducing atherosclerosis in vivo; v) compare analogues of scavengers in their abilities to preserve HDL structure-function in vitro. The goal of all my aims is to develop an understanding of the contribution of lipid dicarbonyl modification of HDL in atherogenesis. My long-term research goals are to identify the contributions of oxidized lipids in altering lipoprotein function and metabolism (LDL, HDL, chylomicrons), and to develop effective strategies to target specific mechanisms that contribute to atherosclerosis initiation and progression. This fellowship will help me build a research program that will lead to a productive career as an independent investigator of oxidative modifications of lipoproteins in CVD."
"9392561","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Fertilization is biological process with important medical, social and economic implications. From extensive study, the events of fertilization are known in some detail. However, the molecular underpinnings of these events generally remain elusive. Most previous work on fertilization has relied on biochemical and immunological approaches. Our work is groundbreaking in the application of classic genetic analysis to this vital area of research.  RATIONALE: Many of the genetic and molecular tools developed for C. elegans are not available or are very difficult to utilize in other organisms traditionally used fo studying fertilization. One of the most significant advantages of C. elegans is the ability to isolate and maintain mutants that affect sperm or eggs and no other cells. Previously, through the study of sterile mutants, we have identified some of the first molecules required for productive gamete interactions in C. elegans. We aim to get a better understanding how sperm molecules (SPE-9, SPE-38, SPE-41/TRP-3 and SPE- 45/Izumo) and oocyte molecules (EGG-1/2) functions to insure successful fertilization. The SPE-45/Izumo gene represents a conserved sperm function from worms to humans. Further, a full understanding of the molecular mechanisms of fertilization is impossible without a more complete inventory of molecular components. Therefore we aim to identify new fertilization molecules through genetic and molecular analysis. Particular emphasis will be placed on the identification of genes required in oocytes.  OBJECTIVES: The goal of this proposal is to further our understanding of fertilization in C. elegans by conducting the following experimental aims: 1) Determine the molecular nature of new gamete function genes defined by a fertilization defective mutant phenotype. 2) Investigate mechanistic connections, functions and fertilization pathways of previously identified gamete function molecules. 3) Conduct a saturation mutagenesis for fertilization mutants taking advantage of an innovative genetic screening strategy that enriches for gamete function mutants. This work will complement fertility studies in other organisms as well as provide insights into the mechanisms of cell-cell interactions and the diversity of reproductive strategies"
"9516253","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Global Characterization of Protein Palmitoylation in Trypanosomes Palmitoylation is a posttranslational modification of proteins that can affect how a protein interacts with lipids and proteins in a membrane compartment. Dual aminoacylation with myristate and palmitate is essential for targeting of proteins to lipid rafts, and is a common feature of key molecules in cell signaling. While N- myristoylation is carried out in the endoplasmic reticulum by a single N-myristoyltransferase, S-palmitoylation, and rarely N-palmitoylation (occurring on an N-terminal cys residue), is mediated by one of a number of palmitoyl acyltransferases (PATs), each having its own localization and substrate specificity. S-palmitoylation is essential for the functions of a number of important proteins and is essential in eukaryotes. Thus, the identification and linkage of specific PATs and their substrates constitutes a unique approach to systematic analysis eukaryote biology. In the African trypanosome, Trypanosoma brucei, our LC-MS/MS and RNAi data strongly suggest that protein palmitoylation is an abundant and important modification. In the proposed project, we will conduct a global analysis of protein palmitoylation in T. brucei in a five-year intensive research effort that will determine the palmitoylproteomes of T. brucei, identify the substrate profiles and functions of T. brucei PATs, and investigate this class of enzymes as potential targets for trypanocidal chemotherapy."
"9379838","Project Summary Many broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) recognize structurally discrete sites on the envelope glycoprotein (Env) of human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1), such as the CD4-binding site (CD4bs), the strand C of variable regions 1 and 2 (V1V2), the N332 supersite at the base of variable region 3 (V3), and the membrane- proximal external region (MPER). Crystallography and electron microscopy (EM) have revealed how these bNAbs interact with individual epitopes, engineered Env domains, and gp140 trimers, providing a rational basis for vaccine design. The scaffolding method has been used to design novel antigens in hope to elicit epitope- specific, bNAb-like B cell responses. In this R01 application, we will combine the latest structural findings with novel technologies in protein design, B cell engineering and knock-in mouse, and next-generation sequencing (NGS) of B cell repertoire to develop and assess epitope-focused vaccine candidates for three bNAb epitopes. The specific aims (SAs) of our R01 proposal are: (1) to design epitope-focused immunogens for three sites of HIV-1 vulnerability. We hypothesize that the N332 supersite of V3 base, the trimeric V1V2 apex, and MPER can be presented by scaffolds and nanoparticles in their bNAb-bound conformations. In a preliminary study, we have designed a panel of antigens based on various principles such as epitope scaffolding, particulate display, and Fc presentation. We have performed structural and antigenic profiling for a subset of antigens with positive results, and will screen the whole panel of antigens to facilitate rational selection; (2) to assess epitope-focused immunogens in bNAb-presenting B cell lines and knock-in mice. We hypothesize that successfully designed epitope-focused immunogens can activate engineered bNAb-expressing B cells and elicit robust responses in bNAb knock-in mice. Previously, we have developed mouse B cell lines expressing CD4bs-, V1V2- and N332- specific bNAbs and b12 knock-in mouse, which were used to assess rationally designed HIV-1 immunogens. We will develop PGT145-, PGT121/128-, and 10E8-expressing B cell lines and knock-in mice and use these tools to assess epitope-focused immunogens selected in Aim 1; (3) to assess the trimer-prime/epitope-boost strategy and B cell responses in NHPs. We hypothesize that a gp140 trimer will elicit NAbs to diverse epitopes and sequential boosts with epitope-focused immunogens will direct B cell responses to the target epitopes. In our preliminary study, we have tested the epitope-focusing effect and neutralization for selected N332 antigens in C57BL/6 mice. Previously, we have conducted a longitudinal study of B cell responses to an HIV-1 gp140- foldon trimer in non-human primates (NHPs). Here, we will first test the trimer-prime/epitope-boost strategy in mice for different epitopes and then assess the immunogenicity and B cell responses in NHPs. In addition to serological assays, we will use antibody NGS to monitor the temporal B cell responses. Our proposed studies thus constitute an innovative and practical research project to develop epitope-focused HIV-1 vaccines."
"9389351","(NEUROIMAGINGANDNEUROCIRCUITRY(NNC):COREE) PROJECT SUMMARY Description: The Neuroimaging and Neurocircuitry Core (NNC) enables the study of changes in brain circuitry which occur in people with IDD. The Core supports research in both patients and animal models by providing users the following state-of-the-art technologies: (a) Magnetoencephalographic (MEG) recordings of brain activity; (b) Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies of brain structure and function; (c) Multiphoton, confocal, and epifluorescence microscopic imaging studies of the dynamics of neuronal circuit function; (d) Patch clamp recording studies in neurons; and (e) Electroencephalographic (EEG) and other in vivo recordings. Analyses are performed in affected human patients with IDD, in Preclinical animal models of IDD, and in vitro (stem cells and tissue culture). Core Directors provide users with access to a wide set of otherwise inaccessible neuronal circuit assessment techniques, as well as expert consultation regarding experimental design and analysis. In all core functions, emphasis is placed upon quality control. In addition to assuring that all studies are competently conducted and appropriately analyzed, the Core Directors assist users to design studies that are properly controlled, adequately powered, and, when feasible, conducted in a blinded fashion. Relevance to IDDRC Mission: The overarching theme of this IDDRC is ?Genes, Brain & Behavior? (see Overview). This Core focuses on each of these overlapping domains. Genetic alterations underlie many IDDs, and result in aberrant protein expression, which alters basic brain function. This in turn generates the behavioral anomalies which constitute IDD. The study of patients and animal models brings the genetic components into sharp focus, and the NNC facilitates examination into how these genetic changes alter brain function and, subsequently, whether such changes are correlated to behavior. Thus, the goal of the Core is to quantify the changes in function of neuronal circuits which result from genetic mutation and variation. Elucidating the changes in dynamic function of neuronal circuitry responsible for the generation of the pathologic behaviors collectively termed the IDD is critical in translational efforts to develop better therapies to treat and cure brain pathologies underlying the IDDs and other related CNS disorders such as autism, epilepsy, and cerebral palsy. Eligibility: These services are available both to approved users of the IDDRC at CHOP/UPenn and to users at other Centers in the Network.   "
"9378775","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Toxoplasma gondii is a widespread protozoan parasite that causes debilitating and sometimes life- threatening disease during pregnancy and in immunocompromised individuals, including those with AIDS. Toxoplasmosis is the second most common cause of death by foodborne illness in the USA and costs the economy billions of dollars annually. T. gondii is also a valuable experimental model for related apicomplexan parasites, including those that cause malaria and cryptosporidiosis. Host cell invasion is essential to the parasite's life cycle, and apical membrane antigen1 (AMA1) is a highly conserved transmembrane protein on the parasite surface that plays an important role in invasion. Much is known about how the extracellular domain of AMA1 interacts with its ligand on the host cell surface (RON2) during invasion, but surprisingly little is known about the function o its short, C-terminal tail, which is located in the parasite cytosol. The central hypothesis of thi project is that the cytosolic tail of T. gondii AMA1 (TgAMA1) functions in invasion-related signaling pathways, through interaction with other parasite proteins. The Aims of the project are to: (a) Determine the phenotypic consequences of specific mutations in the TgAMA1 cytosolic tail, establishing  at what step(s) in invasion the cytosolic tail functions and the specific resides involved; (b) Identify and determine the biological function of proteins that interact with the TgAMA1 cytosolic tail,  establishing whether tail mutations that disrupt invasion also affect the binding of specific proteins; and (c) Determine whether the binding of TgAMA1 to TgRON2 triggers intracellular signaling mediated by the TgAMA1 cytosolic tail, resulting in invasion-related changes to the parasite phosphoproteome. These studies address a significant gap in our understanding of the role that AMA1 plays in the invasion of host cells by apicomplexan parasites. A more complete understanding of AMA1 function will generate new approaches to preventing or controlling the devastating diseases caused by this important group of human pathogens."
"9512592","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that occurs as a consequence of repetitive mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI). CTE causes personality and behavioral changes, executive dysfunction and memory loss and is characterized by the accumulation of phosphorylated tau protein in the brain. The ongoing wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have resulted in a large cohort of OEF/OIF veterans with mTBI from blast exposure who may be at increased risk for CTE. Presently, CTE can only be diagnosed at autopsy and there are no known clinical biomarkers. The development of biomarkers to diagnose this disorder in living individuals would be a major scientific and clinical advance. We hypothesize that multiple combat blast-induced mTBIs cause altered tau metabolism indicative of preclinical CTE. We expect that increased tau biomarkers will be detected in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and in brain using advanced brain imaging techniques in veterans with a history of multiple blast mTBIs. In addition, recent data from our Translational Research Center for TBI and Stress Disorders (TRACTS) show that veteran with significant blast exposure exhibit greater rates and more severe post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) than veterans not exposed to blast neurotrauma. This suggests that the same individuals at risk for PTSD may also be at high risk for CTE.  This project will draw its sample from the TRACTS cohort, which presently consists of 200 OEF/OIF veterans and will increase to ~400 during the proposed study period. History of blast exposure and TBI are documented via a semi-structured interview using the Boston Assessment of TBI: Lifetime (BAT-L). PTSD and other psychiatric illnesses are diagnosed using DSM-IV criteria. The proposed study will investigate the correlative relationship between mTBI metrics (number, severity, distance from blast) and neurocognitive measures of attention and executive function, phosphorylated tau pathology, axonal fiber tract damage, and structural brain changes. We will recruit two groups of 30 participants (total sample size of 60) from the TRACTS cohort that differ maximally in their history of combat TBI: (1) two or more blast mTBIs with associated cognitive symptoms (i.e., acute change in mental status, post-traumatic amnesia or loss of consciousness immediately after the blast) (mTBI); and (2) a matched control group without history of blast exposure or impact head injury (CON). All participants will have served in either OEF or OIF and have a diagnosis of PTSD based on DSM-IV criteria.  We will measure tau biomarkers (phosphorylated tau (ptau), total tau, exosome ptau, oligomeric tau) in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) by plate-based ELISA and conduct advanced brain imaging techniques using simultaneous PET/MRI. We will determine whether there is an association between CSF tau biomarkers, regional (dorsolateral frontal and orbital frontal) PET index metrics, mTBI metrics (number, severity, distance from blast), and neurocognitive measures of attention and executive function,  Blast associated mTBI, PTSD and CTE represent significant scientific challenges in terms of determining their biological origins, their differential diagnosis and respective treatments. If not addressed immediately, the VA will be faced with daunting costs and responsibilities associated with caring for these debilitating neurological and psychiatric disorders. The development of reliable biomarkers to detect CTE will enable the diagnosis and monitoring of this condition during life and assessing the efficacy of potential therapies as they are developed. !"
"9521187","Abstract Corticothalamic circuits linking primary sensory cortex with primary sensory thalamus in the feedback direction are ubiquitous across sensory modalities and mammalian species and are ideally positioned to regulate the flow of sensory signals from periphery to cortex. However, the functional role of these circuits in sensory perception remains a fundamental mystery in neuroscience. In the visual system, corticogeniculate neurons provide the majority of inputs onto neurons in the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN), however receptive fields of LGN neurons closely resemble their retinal inputs and not their corticogeniculate inputs. Partly because corticogeniculate influence over LGN activity appears to be modulatory rather than driving, the functional role of corticogeniculate feedback in vision has been difficult to characterize. The goal of this proposal is to employ optogenetics ? an emerging technology that allows for selective and reversible manipulation of neurons in intact animals ? to examine the structural organization of corticogeniculate circuits and to elucidate their functional contributions toward vision. The three Specific Aims of this proposal address three critical features of corticogeniculate circuits: 1) the structure-function relationships among corticogeniculate circuits; 2) the types of information conveyed by corticogeniculate neurons to LGN neurons; and 3) how corticogeniculate signals impact LGN neuronal activity. A series of nine experiments, three in each Aim, examining corticogeniculate morphology, physiology, functional connectivity, receptive field transformations and impact on LGN activity, will systematically test two alternative hypotheses that corticogeniculate feedback is functionally homogenous versus functionally stream-specific. To accomplish the experiments under each of the three Specific Aims, corticogeniculate neurons in ferrets are selectively infected with virus encoding channelrhodopsin2 and mCherry and optogenetically activated during simultaneous multi-electrode array recordings of LGN and visual cortical neuronal responses to drifting gratings and white noise stimuli. Preliminary results suggest that optogenetic activation of corticogeniculate neurons is sufficient to drive changes in LGN responses to visual stimuli. In revealing the structural and functional organization of corticogeniculate circuits, the information they convey to the LGN and their impact on LGN activity, results of the proposed experiments will reveal whether corticogeniculate circuits serve as global gain modulators that synchronize activity across LGN cell types or selectively prioritize information about specific visual features through stream-specific modulations. Furthermore, insights gained about corticogeniculate circuit function could generalize across corticothalamic pathways throughout the sensory system and inform understanding of sensory circuit disruptions associated with sensory-processing deficits observed in many neurological disorders."
"9384713","Apicomplexan parasites include a number of pathogens of medical and veterinary importance and our long- term goal is to identify novel molecules and pathways in these microorganisms that could be targets for chemotherapy, diagnostic applications, or vaccines.  Many of these parasites rely for their survival on biosynthetic pathways that occur in a remnant plastid known as the apicoplast. A large number of these anabolic pathways are essential for the life of the parasite. Our laboratory recently found a two-pore channel (TPC) that localizes to the apicoplast membrane(s) and is essential for growth of Toxoplasma gondii. Two-pore channels belong to the superfamily of voltage-gated ion channels and are characterized by the presence of two sets of six-transmembrane domains (TMDs). This was an important discovery because it exposed a completely untapped question, which is the role of ions like Ca2+ on the activity of essential anabolic enzymes of the organelle and how this impacts parasite fitness. In addition, and more importantly, ion channels are targets of many therapeutically useful agents and they remain significantly under-exploited as therapeutic targets, even more so as antiparasitic agents.  The apicoplast, the product of a secondary endosymbiosis process, is an organelle surrounded by membranes derived from the cyanobacterium that gave origin to the plastid, the endosymbiotic alga, and the host endosomal compartment. Metal ions play essential roles for the activity of more than one third of all enzymes and considering the large number of essential activities present in the apicoplast, it is likely that ions will be highly regulated in the organelle. No ion transporters or channels have been reported in the apicoplast until now.  This makes our recent discovery of a two-pore channel localized to the apicoplast a unique finding and also an unexpected opportunity for the development of new therapies. TPCs are found in both animal and plant cells where they localize to acidic organelles such as endosomes, lysosomes and vacuoles. TPCs function as Ca2+ channels in mammalian cells and are activated by the second messenger nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NAADP). The Toxoplasma TPC localization to the plastid is unique to Apicomplexa and highlights a novel and potentially specific role for the organelle multiple functions.  We silenced the T. gondii TgTPC gene and found that the mutants display a severe growth defect that can be rescued by complementation with a functional channel. Our hypothesis is that the TPC is a non-selective channel that upon voltage gating is able to conduct cations but in the environment of the cell it probably prefers Ca2+. This hypothesis implies that the apicoplast contains Ca2+, an idea supported by preliminary evidence. We propose a model in which the apicoplast through the TPC and Ca2+ communicates with other organelles via other potential Ca2+ channels. Two other candidate Ca2+ channels will be studied.  Our goal is to define the physiological function of TgTPC using sophisticated biophysical approaches in the context of several model systems. We will combine this with live cell studies to determine how their activity influences the physiology of the apicoplast and other intracellular organelles and the fitness of the parasite."
"9378776","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Clearance of intracellular bacterial pathogens requires initiation of an effective immune response. However, pathogens have evolved virulence factors to disable such immune responses. A key gap in our knowledge is to understand how successful host defense can be achieved despite pathogen subversion. Legionella pneumophila, an important cause of community- and hospital-acquired pneumonia, disarms and replicates within alveolar macrophages by delivering bacterial effectors via a type IV secretion system (T4SS). Several T4SS effectors potently block host protein synthesis. However, host sensing of Legionella T4SS-translocated substrates paradoxically enhances cytokine production. To elucidate the molecular and cellular basis of this host response, we developed a powerful approach to simultaneously track bacterial effector translocation and cytokine responses at the single cell level. We found that infected cells poorly produced several key cytokines, but could still synthesize and release IL-1 family cytokines. Moreover, IL-1 signaling was required for robust production of cytokines by uninfected immune cells and neutrophil-attracting chemokines by lung epithelial cells. Our findings indicate that paracrine IL-1 signaling circumvents the pathogen-imposed translational block to orchestrate a rapid immune response by uninfected bystander cells. While IL-1 signaling is critical for the initiation of host defense,the cell types responding to IL-1 and the specific consequences of IL-1? and IL-1? responses in these cells are unclear. Moreover, mice lacking IL-1 signaling eventually recover bystander cytokine responses, neutrophil recruitment, and control over infection, suggesting that IL-1-independent immune signals coordinate an additional layer of host defense. Thus, we propose the following Aims to define how IL-1-dependent and IL-1-independent immune mechanisms collaborate to generate successful immunity. In Aim 1, we will test the hypothesis that IL-1? and IL-1? regulate distinct immune functions in different cell types. In Aim 2, we will test the hypothesis that additional IL-1-independent immune signals ensure bystander cytokine production and neutrophil recruitment at later stages of Legionella infection. Together, these studies will define novel innate immune mechanisms employed by the host to surmount pathogen-encoded virulence activities. The proposed research will therefore provide vital insight into mechanisms of host defense that are utilized against broad classes of microbial pathogens and aid development of improved anti-microbial therapeutics and vaccines."
"9380975","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Activity-regulated modulation of synapse function lies at the heart of molecular theories of learning and neural development, and is disrupted by diseases and disorders including schizophrenia, autism spectrum disorders, and obsessive compulsive disorder. In glutamatergic synapses, multi-domain proteins establish the core of the postsynaptic density (PSD), the structure which links neurotransmitter receptors to the actin cytoskeleton and to intracellular signaling pathways. Though the structures of PSDs and synapses are known to change dramatically in diverse paradigms of synaptic plasticity, it is not known to what extent structure alone-rather than molecular content such as receptor number-can control synaptic strength. We have developed tools to address this. Thus, in cultured neurons from rat hippocampus, we will use single-molecule imaging approaches along with electrophysiology and new molecular tools to tackle this central question of synapse biology. First, we will follow up on intriguing work from our prior funding period indicating that scaffold molecules in the PSD are distributed with substantial peaks and valleys of density across the PSD parallel to the membrane. We hypothesize that these peaks establish a similar organization of other proteins at points that stretch from the presynaptic terminal too deep into the spine, and particularly that PSD structure guides protein organization within the active zone, thus assuring the optimal alignment of vesicle fusion apparatus with clustered postsynaptic receptors. Second, we ask whether PSD substructure-rather than its overall size-regulates receptor activation and thus synaptic strength. We test this using new techniques to monitor postsynaptic NMDAR or AMPAR activation during concurrent super-resolution imaging to measure postsynaptic structure. Third, using a newly developed method, we analyze for the first time the distribution of vesicle release sites within single active zones. For these aims, we test the role of the key scaffolding molecule Shank in maintaining transsynaptic structural organization, both to test fundamental mechanisms and because its failure to do so may contribute significantly to human disease. The answers to these questions provide a new and detailed view of how synaptic function arises from its notoriously detailed architecture. Perhaps most importantly, they will provide an important platform on which to test hypotheses regarding the molecular basis of disorders that disrupt synaptic transmission."

"9382846","Grant title: Type III exported effectors of Chlamydia trachomatis Abstract: The human pathogen Chlamydia trachomatis is a significant concern in the United States due to its prevalence and the combined health and socioeconomic impact of acute and chronic disease. Chlamydiae are obligate intracellular pathogens that possess the ability to modulate host-cell functions while sequestered within a membrane-bound parasitophorous vacuole. Although it is established that a type III secretion system (T3SS) represents one mechanism employed to modulate critical host cell pathways, the overall understanding of this process in Chlamydia remains limited. During the past funding cycle, we made significant progress in understanding the role of T3S effectors designated CT694 and CT695. Importantly, we also leveraged novel genetic manipulation techniques to investigate the impact of T3S in chlamydial pathogenesis. Perhaps our most important contribution was the development of a fluorescence-reported allelic exchange mutagenesis (FRAEM) approach to allow, for the first time, deletion of targeted chlamydial genes. We have used this technique to create null mutants for ct694 and ct695, and these strains are attenuated in both tissue-culture and animal-infection models. We propose to elucidate molecular details by which mutant phenotypes are manifested. A balanced combination of genetic, biochemical, cell-biology, and animal-based studies are proposed that will define developmental defects, identify host targets important for effector function(s), and gauge the overall role of effectors and target proteins in promoting Chlamydia pathogenesis. Completion of this work will extend the efficacy of genetically manipulating a challenging pathogen and lead to an enhanced understanding of Chlamydia-mediated disease."
"9419608","Title: How do arboviruses escape the mosquito midgut? - Analysis of a novel mechanism Project Summary. Following ingestion of a viremic bloodmeal from a vertebrate host, an arbovirus enters the midgut lumen of a mosquito vector (such as Aedes aegypti) along with the bloodmeal. The virus then needs to enter and infect the midgut epithelial cells of the midgut before the virus disseminates from the midgut to secondary tissues including the salivary glands. Once these are infected, the mosquito transmits the virus to another vertebrate host during probing. The molecular nature of the exit mechanism of the virus from the midgut, has been unresolved so far. In this grant application, we will reveal this mechanism and its genetic background using a multifaceted portfolio of state-of-the-art methodologies. Our previous studies demonstrated that during bloodmeal digestion, chikungunya virus (CHIKV) exits the mosquito midgut via the basal lamina (BL) surrounding the organ. The BL predominantly consists of collagen IV and laminin and its typical pore size exclusion limit appears to be too small for virions to pass through. However, during bloodmeal digestion, the BL alters its structure as midgut-associated collagen IV becomes greatly diminished. We hypothesized that it is this structural change in the BL that allows virions to exit the midgut during bloodmeal digestion. In eukaryotes, known proteinases that modify the extracellular matrix including the BL are matrix metalloproteinases, ADAM/ADAMTS, and serine collagenases. We hypothesize that these classes of proteinases, which are also present in mosquitoes, are responsible for midgut BL modification during bloodmeal digestion. To test these two hypotheses, we propose the following three Specific Aims for this application: 1.) Analyze BL degradation/remodeling and CHIKV dissemination in Ae. aegypti by ultrastructural studies and proteomic analysis; 2.) Identify proteinases that are involved in the BL modification process during bloodmeal digestion and CHIKV dissemination; 3.) Assess whether other viruses (such as Zika, dengue, and Mayaro viruses) utilize the same midgut escape mechanism as observed for CHIKV and how transgenic manipulation of proteinase-of-interest expression affects viral midgut escape in mosquitoes. Completion of these Specific Aims will provide a comprehensive picture explaining the mechanism of the midgut escape barrier, which key enzymes are involved in the mechanism, and whether the mechanism elucidated for CHIKV is the paradigm for other arboviruses. Our results will be critical for developing novel control strategies aimed at manipulating arbovirus midgut escape in mosquitoes. Our findings will also provide the research community with the possibility to develop novel genetic markers for vector competence based on midgut escape."
"9383026","Abstract  Rabies virus (RABV) and related pathogens of the lyssavirus genus cause a fatal neurological disease that leads to at least 55,000 deaths annually. Whereas the current rabies vaccine is save and efficacious, it protects only against infection by phylogroup I lyssaviruses but is ineffective against emerging phylogroup II pathogens that also cause rabies. This efficacy gap equally extends to the human rabies immunoglobulin, which is used in conjunction with vaccination for post-exposure prophylaxis against rabies. Independent of the phylogroup type of the causing agent, no reliable treatment option is currently available for rabies after the onset of clinical symptoms. The development of a novel drug discovery platform for the identification of next- generation anti-lyssavirus drug candidates with activity against all clinically relevant lyssavirus phylogroups is therefore urgently needed.  We hypothesize that shelf-stable and cost-effective small molecule inhibitors with broad anti-lyssavirus indication spectrum will improve global access to life-saving anti-rabies post-exposure prophylaxis, prepare against emerging lyssavirus pathogens of different phylogroups, and establish a foundation to explore innovative treatment options for symptomatic rabies. Building on our highly complementary multiple-year expertise in drug discovery assay development, automated drug screening, lyssavirus biology, and RABV pathogenesis, we have formed an interdisciplinary team to ultimately address this unmet clinical need. In pilot studies, we have generated a first-in-class RABV reporter strain harboring nano-luciferase in place of the G protein encoding open reading frame (RABV-?G-nanoLuc) that induces a single-cycle infection and can be maintained under standard biosafety conditions, developed a novel anti-RABV drug screening protocol suitable for automation, and miniaturized the assay to 384-well scale. In parallel, we have established direct and orthogonal counterscreens for hit candidate confirmation and lyssavirus indication spectrum assessment, and have developed a comprehensive panel of assays for early-stage mechanistic characterization. Building on this tangible foundation, we will in this 3-year pre-therapeutic discovery project fully validate the high-throughput screening (HTS) protocol and apply the assay to a drug discovery campaign using the HTS facilities established in our laboratory (specific aim 1). Emerging hit candidates will be verified in counterscreens, toxicity and indication spectrum determined on established cell lines and primary cells of human and murine origin, and the potential for synthetic optimization assessed (specific aim 2). To short-list a subset of structurally and mechanistically distinct lead candidates that warrant full synthetic development, confirmed hits will be mechanistically characterized, viral escape profiles determined, and the potential for brain penetration evaluated (specific aim 3)."
"9378712","Project Summary/Abstract My primary research interest focuses on the central nervous system regulation of visceral pain with a strategic objective of using preclinical rodent models and multiple state-of-the-art techniques, from molecular and cellular to behavioral, pharmacological and electrophysiological methods to advance basic scientific knowledge that has direct relevance to the diagnosis and treatment of veterans with visceral pain. Below I have summarized the main research projects in my laboratory. 1. Central Neural Circuitry Underlying Anxiety and Visceral pain: Mechanisms of Resilience and Novel Treatments: In one aspect of my research we are studying the neuroanatomical and neuropharmacological substrates involved in the interaction between visceral pain and anxiety. My research focuses on the role of amygdala-mediated mechanisms in the control of visceral and somatic pain and the mechanisms connecting anxiety and visceral (colonic) hypersensitivity. We are attempting to identify at least one potential neural substrate that might be involved in the central processing of visceral pain. From there we hope to identify a receptor mechanism within the neural substrate that mediates central processing of visceral pain. A long-term goal is to investigate how the neural substrate modulates visceral pain sensitivity within the larger neural pathway controlling anxiety, and use this knowledge to identify potential pharmacotherapeutic targets in the central processing pathway that mediates visceral pain. We have demonstrated long lasting increases in anxiety-like behavior and viscerosomatic sensitivity in response to the local exposure of the amygdala to corticosterone (CORT). We found persistent down-regulation of GR expression and increases in the expression of CRF and HCN1 channels leading to hyper-excitability of the CeA neurons. These changes in gene expression represent a potential mechanism leading to chronic anxiety and pain, via facilitation of the HPA axis. The objective of latest experiments has been to use gene knockdown to directly manipulate CRF and GR expression in the central amygdala. We found that knockdown of CRF within the amygdala inhibits stress-induced chronic visceral and somatic pain, and that loss of GR within the amygdala is key to triggering visceral and somatic pain. Such findings are relevant for the future development of gene targeted therapeutics to treat stress-induced visceral and somatic pain (Funded by the Department of Veteran's Affairs Merit Award: 2013-2017). 2. Early life stress on visceral and somatic pain in adulthood: Sex differences. In women, IBS is the most prevalent GI disorders. Emotional stressors, increased anxiety or uni- and bipolar associative disorders often exacerbate symptoms. Despite this knowledge and evidence that females embody strong connections to life stressors, physical/sexual abuse and an emotionally reactive disposition related to the outbreak of symptomatology, there has been very little progress made to enhance our understanding of the descending connections between the brain and the GI tract in female Veterans. Our latest project was designed to investigate the mechanisms by which the context of the early life stress (ELS) can affect nociception in adulthood. We are also exploring evidence for a two hit hypothesis underlying the vulnerability to visceral pain in females. Specifically, we will investigate the mechanisms by which an unpredictable stress in early life leads to chronic abdominal pain in adulthood. Additionally we will assess the impact of ELS on the amygdala response to an adult stressor (Funded by the Department of Veteran's Affairs Merit Award: 2010-2014; 2015- 2019)."
"9384984","ABSTRACT Pneumococcal polysaccharide (PPS conjugate vaccines (PCV) have had remarkable impact in preventing invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD), but there is still a gap in treatment and prevention of pneumococcal disease as current vaccines are less effective for pneumonia than IPD and less immunogenic in patients most at risk for disease. My group has a longstanding interest in vaccine-elicited PPS antibodies and how they work. We made the paradigm-shifting discovery that while some PPS3 monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) that protect mice from serotype 3 (ST3) pneumococcus mediate phagocyte killing of ST3 in vitro (opsonic), others do not (non-opsonic). These MAb types have distinct PPS3 specificities and require different effectors and Fc?Rs to protect mice from ST3 pneumonia. Opsonic antibodies induce early lung bacterial clearance, but non-opsonic MAbs do not, instead they reduce lung inflammation. These findings challenge prevailing dogma that vaccine efficacy is solely a function of opsonic antibodies and show there is still much to learn about how PPS antibodies mediate protection. The goal of this application is to make human monoclonal antibodies (huMAbs) to treat ST3 pneumonia. Ultimately, we wish to develop a multi-ST huMAb cocktail, but ST3 will be our first target as PCV13 is less effective for ST3, an important cause of pneumonia that still carries higher risk of death than other STs. We hypothesize huMAbs that balance ST3 clearance and control of host inflammation will provide the most protection. We will generate PPS3 huMAbs from pneumococcal vaccine recipients, use a novel ST3 glycan array to identify huMAb PPS3 epitopes, and determine their functional activities in vitro and efficacies against ST3 in vivo in colonization, pneumonia, and sepsis models in normal and human (hu)Fc?R transgenic mice. This will identify candidate huMAbs to advance for therapy, reveal potentially new correlates of protection, and identify potential adjunctive PPS3 antigens to enhance vaccine efficacy for pneumonia. This project will advance understanding of mechanisms of antibody action and have a major impact on clinical medicine and public health by removing roadblocks to prevention and treatment of pneumococcal pneumonia with ideas and an approach that can be applied to any pathogen."
"9588841","Pain is the leading reason for adult outpatient and emergency department medical visits, impacting over 100 million Americans at a cost of over $600 billion dollars annually. Low back pain (LBP) represents 28% of this health-care problem and is the leading cause of disability, both in the United States and worldwide. Opioids are the most commonly prescribed drug class in the United States, and the majority of these prescriptions are for LBP. Despite the broad application of opioid therapy in LBP, the phenotypes of individuals who experience pain relief from opioid treatment have not been identified, leaving providers without clear guidance for safe and effective therapy. Given this staggering burden of disease and health-care utilization, clinical information regarding LBP widely populates the electronic health record (EHR), providing a valuable data source. However, this information presently has little meaning beyond the individual patient experience because the majority of pain-related data from the EHR is embedded in free text. Using EHR data may provide the crucial bridge to a better understanding of LBP. Thus, the central hypothesis of this proposal is that translating clinical experiences into discrete and analyzable data, specifically modeling opioid response phenotypes for patients with LBP, will identify clinically relevant phenotypic treatment responses. To test this hypothesis, this mentored career development project will adapt and apply natural language processing (NLP), data standardization, mining, and analysis tools to specifically model opioid response phenotypes for patients with LBP to characterize pain intensity, functional status, and pain interference with activity. Through integrated aims, this proposal will, 1) support the annotation of LBP and opioid note corpus, and the mapping of clinical concepts related to pain intensity, functional status, and pain interference with activities; 2) use NLP to identify and relate relevant opioid response phenotypes in patients with LBP in the EHR; and 3) characterize LBP phenotypes associated with opioid dose escalation. Clinical NLP uses statistical modeling to extract and transform high dimensional clinical data, which, when developed with the PI?s domain knowledge, creates a unique opportunity to understand LBP management, outcomes, and therapeutic efficacy. Ultimately this foundation may be used to predict clinical outcomes and responses to therapeutic interventions. Our long-term goal is to move beyond identifying disease phenotype profiles to create a system to identify treatment response phenotypes. Stratifying patients based on pain intensity, functional status, pain interference and other factors, we plan to identify potential cohorts that warrant further study from a genetic focus. This mentored career development grant (K08) will support a clinical expert?s adaptation of tools and training in a systematic method to allow growth toward a programmatic line of research that is incredibly responsive to the NIH pain research agenda and can transition to independent R01-level funding."
"9379458","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Adapting behavior and cognition to meet changing environmental demands is critical for optimizing wellbeing. Previous research has identified an important role for the neuromodulator dopamine, particularly with respect to its effects on the striatum, in regulating cognitive flexibility, that is, the ability to flexibly update the contentsof working memory and relevant goals. Variability in the striatal dopamine system has been associated with alterations in cognitive flexibility, and indeed, a variety of neuropsychiatric disorders including attentional deficit disorder, Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia, and drug addiction are characterized by abnormalities in both dopaminergic neurotransmission and cognitive control. Importantly, both appetitive and aversive motivation are thought to phasically increase and decrease, respectively, the release of dopamine into the striatum, thus raising the possibility that motivational context may differentially impact cognitive control processes. Recent work has demonstrated that reward motivation increases cognitive flexibility, but only in individuals with higher baseline levels of striatal dopamine. Research examining the impact of aversive motivation on cognitive control has been much more limited; in one study, threat of punishment was associated with reduced updating of working memory content, suggesting that aversive motivation may bias individuals away from cognitive flexibility and toward cognitive stability. However, to date, no work has explicitly examined the role of baseline dopamine system function in mediating the influence of aversive motivation on cognitive control processes or the frontostriatal circuitry that supports them. By exploiting genetic variants known to impact the striatal dopamine system, and using a targeted psychopharmacological intervention, the proposed fMRI experiment seeks to fill this gap by examining the effect of striatal dopamine variability on patterns of brain activation and cognitive flexibility in the face of aversive motivation. A second aim of the proposed research is to characterize the role of the habenula in moderating the impact of an aversive motivational context on cognitive control processes. The habenula is a small region of the epithalamus that has recently been implicated in inhibiting striatal DA release in response to potential punishment; if inhibition of striatal DA resulting fro aversive motivation impacts the frontostriatal circuitry supporting cognitive flexibility, the habenula may provide a critical linkage between motivation and cognitive control. Together, the proposed research will expand our knowledge of the neurobiological mechanisms that may contribute to individual differences in the relation between motivation and cognition. Further, results of this work may inform our understanding of cognitive control abnormalities in neuropsychiatric disorders characterized by aberrant DA neurotransmission and of the impact of both therapeutic and illicit drug use on aspects of cognitive control."
"9490200","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Modified Project Summary/Abstract Section African American (AA) men are at a greater risk of developing aggressive prostate cancer (PrCa) than are Caucasian men. Therefore, identifying biomarkers involved in aggressive PrCa that can be used to identify AA men for specific and/or novel therapies would provide a major advance in public health. Consequently, there is intense effort to identify potential biomarkers that could independently predict poor clinical outcome and identify novel therapies for men with aggressive PrCa. Notably, heat shock proteins, PrCa Antigen 3, and Serine Protease Inhibitor Kazal-type 1, are all overexpressed in men with PrCa, where as Annexin II is suppressed. Despite the biological importance of these biomarkers, no studies have yet evaluated the significance of these biomarkers in AA men with aggressive PrCa. We believe that Howard's University Hospital urologic clinic which evaluates approximately 200 PrCa patients per year, is an ideal source for studying the importance of biomarkers as predictors of aggressive PrCa in AA men. We propose to evaluate the bi-directional expression of protein and gene signature pairs different in archival tissue samples from AA men who had been diagnosed with an aggressive form of PrCa at the Washington VA Medical Center and Howard and Johns Hopkins University Cancer Centers. The main hypothesis is that the bi-directional expression of genes and proteins is predictive of aggressive, lethal PrCa risk. To test this hypothesis we propose two aims. The first aim will test the hypothesis that microarray gene expression profiling produces bi-directional biomarker signature pairs that can be used to build a risk prediction model for PrCa. The second aim will test the hypothesis that the risk prediction of poor clinical outcome with bi-directional gene and protein expression pairs is superior to the use of a single gene or protein. Candidate pairs include those discovered in Aim 1. We anticipate that these studies may provide insight into selected genes and proteins as reliable predictive biomarkers for identifying aggressive PrCa in AA men, and could inform future human clinical applications for treatment of aggressive PrCa."
"9379793","ABSTRACT. Malaria and other vector-borne diseases pose an immense burden on mankind. To date, control campaigns to stop transmission of the Plasmodium parasites that cause malaria have relied on the distribution of drugs to treat those infected, and on the use of insecticide-impregnated bednets and indoor residual sprays to stop Anopheles mosquitoes from transmitting the infection. Historically targeting the mosquito vector with these insecticide-based methods has been our best weapon for controlling the spread of the disease, but mosquito populations are developing resistance to insecticides at an alarming rate, making disease control increasingly challenging. In the search for new powerful strategies aimed at controlling malaria-transmitting Anopheles populations, we can now exploit novel powerful genome engineering tools. In this project I am to use CRISPR/Cas technology in Anopheles gambiae to enable studies into critical aspects of mosquito basic biology and to enable a new generation of genetic control strategies. During my studies I have validated the function of CRISPR/Cas in A. gambiae and developed a powerful set of genetic engineering tools that I will use to study a novel crosstalk between reproduction and vectorial capacity, as well as to generate and test novel genetic control strategies for population suppression and replacement. Using CRISPR I have generated a line of mutant mosquitoes with large deletions in Zero Population Growth (ZPG), a gene critical for germ cell development. Resulting female mutants have atrophied ovaries while males show no sperm in the testes. In infection experiments with Plasmodium falciparum, the most deadly malaria parasite, females that are unable to develop eggs become less infected with parasites, suggesting a link between signaling from the ovaries and Plasmodium development. Therefore in this proposal I aim to elucidate the role of ovary-based signaling on P. falciparum development (Aim 1A). Furthermore I aim to explore the potential for the ZPG mutant spermless males to be used in Sterile Insect Technique (SIT) for population suppression campaigns (Aim 1B). CRISPR/Cas can also be used to facilitate gene drive systems capable of spreading desired traits to fixation in natural mosquito populations. Using my expertise in this technology, in Aim 2 I will develop an ?evolutionarily stable? gene drive system to robustly spread desirable traits to facilitate the fight against malaria. This drive system will guarantee drive spread by targeting two essential genes clustered together in the A. gambiae genome, making incorrect drive copying inviable. Further the system will be easily editable to enable testing of a wide variety of drive architectures and different anti-malarial or sterilizing cargoes. The findings of this project will be instrumental for expanding our knowledge of mosquito biological processes shaping vectorial capacity, and will expand the genetic toolkit available for the manipulation of wild Anopheles populations."
"9378090","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant) Enteric pathogens, which represent a major group of disease-causing agents, must overcome barrier immunity within the intestinal environment to infect a host. To counter this, the gastrointestinal tract has evolved as a physical and immunological barrier. Moreover, many enteric viruses infect intestinal epithelial cells which are both targets of and act as sentinels for infection. Increasing evidence suggests that epithelial cells sense infection directly to induce antimicrobial pathways. It is also clear that the microfloa within the intestinal tract plays a fundamental role in immunity and that imbalanced bacterial communities have detrimental consequences to immune defense. Aging animals present with immune deficiencies and an altered microbiome. Mechanistically, which microbes or microbial ligands, mediate these effects and how they impact antiviral immunity is unclear. To overcome our gap in knowledge of the molecular mechanisms that control enteric viral infection, we developed an oral model of arboviral infection using the powerful genetic model organism, Drosophila melanogaster. We found that the gut presents a high barrier to infection: young wild type flies are refractory to oral challenge with enteric viruses, while inoculation into the body cavity, which bypasses the gut, results in robust infection. Importantly, we found that the ERK pathway is activated in the intestinal epithelium by infection, and that genetic depletion of the ERK pathway only in the intestinal epithelium leads to increased infection. Furthermore, we found that the microbiota plays an important role in susceptibility to infection. In young flies, te loss of commensals in the gut led to increased permissivity to viral infection, suggesting that signals from the microbiota impact innate signaling. However, we found that older flies that present with dysbiosis are more susceptible to oral viral infection. Under these conditions ablation of the commensals protects the animals from enteric viral infection. Therefore, the microbiota, depending on its composition, can either be protective or detrimental for antiviral defenses. In this proposal we will address fundamental questions in antiviral immunity by determining the mechanisms by which the microbiota and epithelial cells control immunity in the intestine against human viruses, using a genetically tractable organism with a highly manipulable microbiome and short lifespan."
"9555562","PROJECT SUMMARY This proposal aims to tissue engineer an anisotropic neo-meniscus that also captures the regional variations present in the native tissue. Subsequently, allogeneic neo-meniscal constructs will be implanted in a leporine model to achieve both meniscus repair and replacement. It is hypothesized that: 1) regionally variant, anisotropic, meniscus-shaped constructs can be engineered by optimizing cell culture and scaffold-free culture conditions; 2) the strategic temporal application of multi-level stimuli (at cellular-, molecular-, and construct- levels) will allow for synergisms across the different levels of action to enhance the functional properties of the maturing neo-menisci; and 3) allogeneic constructs can be successfully implanted in a leporine model. These hypotheses will be tested via the following three specific aims: 1) To create an anisotropic neo-meniscus with regional variations mimicking native tissue; 2) to enhance functional and organizational properties of the neo- meniscus via multi-level exogenous stimulation synergized by temporal coordination; and 3) to develop surgical fixation techniques and implant the neo-menisci in the rabbit. Previously, the native meniscus was found to be highly anisotropic and regionally variant both morphologically and biomechanically, motivating our current tissue engineering approach to mimic these characteristics. Allogeneic leporine cells will be used to form organizationally and regionally mimetic neo-meniscal constructs in Aim 1; this goal will be accomplished via the use of novel spatial and temporally variant seeding techniques. The anisotropic and organizational properties of the engineered neo-meniscus will then be enhanced by manipulating molecular-, cellular-, and construct-level targets in Aim 2. Specifically, TGF-?1 and hydrostatic pressure will act on the cellular level to increase matrix production; lysophosphatidic acid and chondroitinase-ABC will be used to align and compact the matrix at the molecular level; and meniscus-specific mechanical stimulation will direct anisotropy at the construct level. In this proposal, to avoid the use of primary cells, we will investigate the use of passaged allogeneic cells toward in vivo repair and replacement of the meniscus (Aim 3). Upon successful demonstration of repair/replacement in the leporine model, we will determine methods to likewise expand sheep and human cells for future studies. This approach seeks to address the issue of tissue scarcity and aims to provide a solution to the complex problem of meniscus repair and replacement."
"9382952","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) constitute a heterogeneous group of neurodevelopmental disorders characterized by impaired social-communication function, repetitive behaviors, and a restricted range of interests. ASD affects approximately 1 in every 88 individuals and the incidence appears to be rising. Within ASD, there exists wide phenotypic heterogeneity in adaptive function, cognitive and language abilities, and neurological comorbidities, leading many to refer to these various disorders as 'the autisms'. Therefore, two key questions emerge: (1) Despite phenotypic and genetic heterogeneity, does ASD have common neurobiological signatures? (2) Can such neurobiological signatures be studied in vivo in humans? Answers to these questions would represent a significant step forward in our understanding of ASD, as well as our ability to diagnose and treat this condition. We have recently developed a new technique for the analysis of resting state fMRI data based on mapping propagated intrinsic brain activity. When applied to fMRI data obtained in high-functioning adults with ASD, the new method appears to be more sensitive than conventional functional connectivity analysis in detecting focal brain abnormalities. The objective of this project is to apply this new technique to fMRI data collected in young, typically developing children, as well as children who develop ASD. Preliminary results indicate that our method detects changes, at the group level, in the temporal structure of intrinsic activity in 6-month-old children who subsequently develop clinical ASD. This finding is consistent with recent post-mortem pathology evidence of disrupted cortical organization in individuals with ASD very early in life, perhaps even in utero. The intimate relationships between the temporal structure of intrinsic activity, neuronal plasticity, and early brain development provide a strong theoretical basis for this investigation. Specific questions to be investigated include: (1) what is the earliest age at which patterns of propagated intrinsic activity in childre with ASD differ, at the group level, from typically developing children? (2) Are different brain regions affected by ASD at different ages? Answers to these questions may illuminate the neurobiological basis of ASD. By investigating the causes and developmental trajectory of ASD, our project is directly in line with the first two objectives of the NIMH strategic plan. We will aso explore how patterns of propagated intrinsic activity change over the course of typical early development to gain a better understanding of the neural correlates of normal developmental milestones. Characterization of normal development could inform future investigations of other neurodevelopmental disorders."
"9387374","PROJECT SUMMARY Staphylococcus aureus and methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) infections are a growing problem in the United States with over 18,000 deaths reported annually. There is no vaccine and as S. aureus becomes more drug resistant the number of treatment options is diminishing. New strategies and approaches are urgently needed to combat the rise in S. aureus infections. The ability of S. aureus to cause disease is due, in part, to an extensive repertoire of secreted and cell wall associated proteins. These virulence factors include adhesins, toxins, exoenzymes, and superantigens. Typically these virulence factors are made inside the bacterial cell and are transported across the cell membrane in a denatured state. Once outside the cell they refold into their active form. Peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerases (PPIases) are enzymes that assist in the folding of proteins. They catalyze the isomerization between the cis and trans form of proline peptide bonds, thus accelerating the rate of refolding in proteins containing prolines. The absence of PPIase activity can lead to delayed/incorrect folding and a loss of protein activity. In bacteria PPIases have been shown to assist in the folding of secreted virulence factors and in doing so contribute to virulence, however their role in S. aureus remains unknown. Previous work on Staphylococcal nuclease (Nuc), a secreted virulence factor, has demonstrated that the isomerization state of a single proline bond (K116-P117) controls the rate of Nuc refolding. The addition of a PPIase can accelerate refolding, however the identity of the Staphylococcal PPIase involved is unknown. In this proposal we identify a Staphylococcal PPIase (PrsB) that is required for Nuc activity. We demonstrate that equal amounts of Nuc are secreted in a prsB mutant and wild-type strain, however the secreted Nuc is less active when secreted from the prsB mutant. Consequently, we hypothesize that PrsB is assisting Nuc folding and in doing so contributes to S. aureus pathogenesis via its PPIase activity. In aim 1 of this proposal we will test this hypothesis by first determining the amino acid residues important for PrsB PPIase activity. Using this information we will construct a PrsB PPIase-inactive strain (prsB?PPIase) by introducing amino acid substitutions that disrupt PPIase activity onto the S. aureus chromosome. The resulting strain will be used in an abscess model of infection to determine the specific contribution of PrsB PPIase activity to virulence. In aim 2 we will investigate direct protein targets of PrsB. We will perform in vitro Nuc refolding assays to determine the direct contribution of PrsB to Nuc refolding, and identify S. aureus proteins that directly interact with and are co-purified with PrsB by immunoprecipitation. We hypothesize that the co-purified proteins represent additional PrsB targets and may be responsible for a decrease in cytotoxicity observed in the culture supernatants of the prsB mutant. The data generated from this proposal will serve as the foundation for future studies to explore the molecular mechanism through which PrsB affects the virulence of S. aureus and identify potential PrsB inhibitors, which may represent a novel anti-virulence therapy to combat S. aureus infection."
"9395157","PROJECT SUMMARY Despite major advances in the treatments, diarrheal diseases are a major health burden worldwide. Although oral rehydration therapy has significantly reduced mortality from infectious diarrhea, more efficacious drugs are needed to reduce morbidity and mortality caused by enteric infections. Activation of aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) has been shown to be an effective therapeutic strategy to combat enteric infections and other forms of gastrointestinal inflammation. AhR is a ligand-activated nuclear receptor that coordinates anti-microbial responses in the gut, in addition to xenobiotic detoxification. Activation of AhR by exogenous compounds has been well established, while its activation by endogenous molecules warrants further investigation. Our preliminary data showed that serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT), a tryptophan derived important neurotransmitter and hormone, could serve as an endogenous ligand/activator of AhR in intestinal epithelial cells. 5-HT is internalized in the cell via its uptake through a Na+/Cl- dependent serotonin transporter (SERT). Interestingly, our studies demonstrated that 5-HT increases the expression of CYP1A1, the canonical gene target of AhR, via a SERT dependent process. Additionally, the expression of CYP1A1 and of CCL20 was suppressed in the intestinal mucosa of mice lacking functional serotonin transporter (SERT). CCL20, an additional AhR gene target, is an anti-microbial peptide produced by epithelial cells that attracts immune cells to sites of infection. Thus, to establish the novel link between 5-HT and AhR dependent pathways, our proposed studies will test the hypothesis that 5-HT or its metabolites act as endogenous modulators of AhR. We will further examine if decreased uptake of 5-HT by SERT deficiency leads to impaired bacterial defenses. Studies proposed in Specific Aim 1 will investigate the molecular mechanisms of AhR activation by 5-HT using state-of-art in vitro and ex vivo models including intestinal epithelial cell lines and enteroids that faithfully recapitulate the crypt-villus architecture of the intestine. Specific Aim 2 will examine the susceptibility of SERT KO mice to Citrobacter rodentium infection, a mouse pathogen closely related to clinically important human pathogens Enteropathogenic E.coli and Enterohemorrhagic E. coli as a model of infectious disease. To confirm the role of SERT in AhR modulated pathways, we will evaluate the ability of transgenic mice with intestinal specific overexpression of SERT to upregulate AhR gene targets involved in the antimicrobial responses in the absence or presence of bacterial lipopolysaccharise (LPS). Overall, the outcome of the proposed studies will demonstrate the importance of intestinal 5-HT and SERT as novel therapeutic targets to treat gut disorders such as enteric infections or inflammation. These studies will also form a critical training platform for the PI's growth as an inquisitive scientist and as a skilled clinician."
"9379413","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A major clinical challenge is the realization that common diseases such as diabetes, atherosclerotic heart disease, and even some cancers that used to be considered as adult-onset pathologies may actually have their origins during early periods of human development. The cytosolic sulfotransferases (SULTs) catalyze the conjugation of pharmaceuticals, environmental chemicals, hormones, cholesterol, and bile acids. Our long term goal is to understand how differences in SULT1C expression during the stages of development might impact drug efficacy and safety as well as susceptibility to environmental carcinogens and modulators of metabolic processes. Our short-term goals are to determine the expression pattern and regulators of SULT1C expression and to elucidate substrates and inhibitors of SULT1C metabolism. Unlike other xenobiotic- metabolizing enzymes, SULT1Cs are predominantly expressed during fetal life and are known to bioactivate xenobiotic molecules to toxic and carcinogenic intermediates. However, the role(s) of the SULT1C enzymes in endogenous metabolism and physiology are, as yet, uncharacterized. Our discovery that SULT1C genes are regulated by lipid- and xenobiotic-sensing transcription factors defines an unforeseen role for SULT1C enzymes at the heart of human development and metabolic signaling while also indicating that SULT1C enzymes operate at the interface of the physiological and xenobiotic environments. The hypothesis is that (1) the human SULT1C genes are differentially expressed in liver, kidney, stomach, and intestine and during development, (2) expression of these SULTs is differentially regulated by nuclear signaling mechanisms that include the farnesoid X receptor (FXR), the liver X receptor (LXR), the vitamin D receptor (VDR), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor ? (PPAR?), and the xenobiotic-sensing receptors pregnane X receptor (PXR) and aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), and (3) certain sterols and/or bile acids are endogenous substrates for the SULT1C enzymes. To test this hypothesis, the four specific aims of this proposal are to, (1) Determine the expression of human SULT1C2, SULT1C3, and SULT1C4 in fetal, infant, and adult tissue from liver, kidney, stomach, and intestine, (2) Define the mechanisms that control transcription of human SULT1C2, SULT1C3, and SULT1C4 in cellular models of liver, kidney, and intestine, with emphasis on regulation by lipid- and xenobiotic-sensing transcription factors, (3) Define the mechanism(s) that regulate SULT1C2 transcription during hepatic differentiation, and (4) Identify the structure-function activity and inhibition relationships of the human SULT1C enzymes. This project will shed new light on human SULT1C gene expression, regulation, and function. It is essential to obtain this understanding since the SULT1C enzymes likely play important physiological roles during development and, due to their distinct abilities to bioactivat toxic and carcinogenic compounds, are primed to promote disease susceptibility during critical windows of vulnerability."
"9386720","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The receptor tyrosine kinases of the TAM family ? Tyro3, Axl, and Mer ? are essential regulators of infection by enveloped viruses, and Axl and Mer are especially important to arbovirus infection of cells of the central nervous system (CNS). Infection of the CNS by encephalitic arboviruses, including West Nile virus (WNV), often has devastating consequences, both acutely and after recovery, and deciphering the molecular mechanisms through which TAM receptors control virus entry, propagation, and clearance is therefore a key objective. Genetic, molecular biologic, cell biologic, and behavioral assays will be used to elucidate these mechanisms. In Aim 1, a set of new conditional mouse mutants and cell-specific Cre drivers will be used to investigate the CNS cell types through which TAM receptors control infection by WNV and two other neurotropic enveloped arboviruses - La Crosse encephalitis virus and Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus. These studies will elucidate the specific roles played by Axl and Mer in brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMECs), microglia, astrocytes, and pericytes in neuroinvasion and CNS pathogenesis by these viruses. In Aim 2, a new mouse model of learning impairment after recovery from CNS infection by WNV will be used to probe the role that Axl and Mer in microglia and astrocytes play in spatial learning and memory after infection. These experiments also will assess the role that cell-specific TAM signaling plays in synapse elimination and neurogenesis subsequent to WNV infection of the brain. In Aim 3, molecular genetics and cell-based signaling assays will be used to elucidate the molecular architecture of TAM receptor-Interferon receptor (IFNAR) interaction, which is crucial to the phenomena of Aims 1 and 2, in BMECs, microglia, macrophages, and dendritic cells. These studies will identify the signaling pathways activated by cooperative TAM receptor/INFAR signaling in these cells, and assess the ability of these interacting receptor systems to reorganize actin cytoskeletons. Together, the experiments of this proposal will guide the formulation of novel strategies for inhibiting virus entry into the CNS, attenuating virus infection of neural cells, and promoting the repair and recovery of infected neural tissues."

"9388965","Summary Regulators of Th2 inflammation at the barrier interface in chronic allergic diseases such as atopic dermatitis and asthma are not as well characterized as those in the initiation phase. Yet effector functions of leukocytes in the chronic phase of Th2 inflammation drive symptomatic human disease that results in immune pathology associated with much morbidity after usually asymptomatic allergen sensitization. Chemokines are chemotactic cytokines that control leukocyte recruitment and inflammation by binding specific receptors on target cells. We recently discovered that the human chemokine CCL18 is a novel agonist of the CCR8 receptor. CCL18 is a signature chemokine produced by Th2 cytokine differentiated IL-4 spectrum macrophages, M(IL-4)s, also known as alternatively activated or M2 macrophages. CCL18 is associated with several chronic and eosinophilic inflammatory human diseases, and is one of the most highly induced chemokines in lesional atopic dermatitis skin. M(IL-4) interactions with the recently discovered Group 2 Innate Lymphoid Cells (ILC2) have been shown to facilitate eosinophilic inflammation. CCR8 is also a top signature gene of the mouse ILC2 transcriptome. Recently IL-4R? blockade, which inhibits M(IL-4) differentiation, resulted in striking clinical improvement of treatment refractory atopic dermatitis that highly correlated with suppression of CCL18. Yet, whether and how CCL18 and M(IL-4)s sustain chronic atopic dermatitis pathology is not known. Our published and new preliminary data lead us to hypothesize that though M(IL-4)s are anti-inflammatory in acute inflammation, they undergo pathogenic transformation at barrier interfaces to become pro-inflammatory in chronic inflammation, and partly through the CCR8 pathway and other mediators, and local interactions with cells such as ILC2s sustain chronic eosinophilic allergic inflammation in the skin. To test this hypothesis we will use a model of chronic allergic dermatitis. We also discovered a novel mouse chemokine agonist of the CCR8 receptor that is a functional analog of CCL18. We thus propose to: (1) Determine if M(IL-4)s are crucial for chronic allergic inflammation and identify mechanisms by which they do so, and if this is regulated by the CCR8 pathway; and (2) Define how ILC2s contribute to chronic allergic inflammation and if this is mediated by the CCR8 pathway. We will determine the clinical correlates of the studies proposed in Aims 1 and 2 using clinical specimens from individuals with eczema that will be compared to healthy controls."
"9568886","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Despite significant therapeutic advances in other cancers, treatment of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) has improved only modestly over the past several decades. Consequently, pancreatic cancer remains the fourth leading cause of cancer death in the United States and a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Mutation of the proto-oncogene KRAS is a hallmark of PDAC, occurring in >90% of cases. Studies in animal models and cell lines have suggested that mutant KRAS is important for both the initiation and maintenance of PDAC, making KRAS an attractive target for therapy. Unfortunately, efforts to directly target KRAS have been thwarted by several unique features of the mutant protein, making KRAS ?undruggable? to date. Furthermore, current strategies to inhibit putative downstream signaling pathways have been largely unsuccessful. Given the high prevalence of KRAS mutations in not only PDAC but also cancers of the lung and colon, the development of new approaches to target KRAS mutant cancers remains a significant unmet need. The long-term goal of the proposed research is to improve our understanding of KRAS biology to facilitate the development of novel therapeutic strategies in PDAC and other KRAS mutant cancers. Our preliminary studies revealed that partial or complete inhibition of mutant KRAS induced marked and reversible changes in gene expression, cell signaling, and drug sensitivity, suggesting that KRAS fosters a specific cell state, potentially amenable to targeted inhibition. In this proposal, we leverage novel PDAC cell lines in which KRAS has been inactivated by CRISPR/Cas-mediated genome editing, a lentiviral cDNA library permitting expression of a diverse array of KRAS mutant variants, and CRISPR-based genome-wide screening libraries to interrogate key KRAS-relevant functional pathways and elucidate synthetic lethal interactions with KRAS mutation. Specifically, we propose to re-express different KRAS mutant variants to identify variant-specific effectors through transcriptional and biochemical profiling, offering an unprecedented evaluation of KRAS mutant variants in cancer cells. In parallel, we plan to elucidate unique genetic dependencies in cells harboring or lacking KRAS function using CRISPR-based screening. Together, these approaches are likely to reveal novel targetable pathways and proteins in KRAS mutant cells, which we will validate in additional cell lines in vitro and transplant and autochthonous models in vivo. The proposed research strategy is part of an extensive training program designed to facilitate my transition to becoming an independent investigator in basic and translational cancer biology. The main experiments will be conducted in the Jacks laboratory at the Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research at MIT under the guidance of Dr. Tyler Jacks, an international leader in KRAS biology and mouse models of cancer. Co- mentorship on clinical and translational science will be provided by Dr. Charles Fuchs, a leading clinical researcher and Director of the GI SPORE at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Harvard Cancer Center (DF/HCC). The scientific community, encompassing the DF/HCC, Koch Institute at MIT, and Harvard Medical School, offers an outstanding environment for scientific discussion and collaboration. In addition, I have assembled a scientific advisory committee, comprised of Drs. William Hahn, Matthew Vander Heiden, and Alec Kimmelman, who collectively have a wealth of information and expertise in basic and translational research. In addition to presenting my work locally at seminars within the Harvard and MIT community, I have also proposed a comprehensive set of didactic coursework through the Harvard Catalyst program to enhance my understanding of translational research with a focus on target identification, preclinical validation, and T1 translation. As a medical oncologist and physician-scientist, I am committed to improving the care of cancer patients, with a focus on pancreatic cancer and other gastrointestinal malignancies. As a postdoctoral fellow in the Jacks lab, I have led the development of several projects, building novel tools and reagents that I will utilize in the proposed experiments. Results from these studies will form the basis for developing an independently-funded laboratory. While I have been successful in acquiring fellowship funding to support my preliminary studies, the K08 award will provide critical funding for continued mentored research and transition to independence."
"9504039","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The objective of this study is to determine the interaction between Plk1 and B-Raf in melanocytic cells with the idea that this interaction plays a critical role in melanocytic transformation.  Constitutively active oncogenic B-RafV600E mutations play an important role in melanomagenesis. However, B-Raf mutation alone are insufficient for melanocytic transformation, suggesting the involvement of other factors. Synthetic lethality, derived from the concept of `gene interaction', is gaining popularity towards developing new means and targets for certain diseases, including neoplastic conditions. Two genes are said to be synthetic lethal if mutation of either of them alone leaves the cell viable, while simultaneous modulations leads to a different fate for the cells. Thus, one gene buffers the effect of changes in the other to compensate for the effect of its deletion. This concept can help in identifying i) the buffering relationships among interacting genes, and ii) the malfunction and diseases that may occur when these relationships are altered. Exploring these relationships may lead to information how cellular processes work when the protein products expressed by two different genes have an effect together but not separately. Identification of interacting partner of B-Raf will provide a better understanding of mechanism of melanocytic transformation as well as identification of novel approaches to combat melanomagenesis. Polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1) plays pivotal roles in multiple aspects of cell division (mitosis). We have shown that compared to normal melanocytes, Plk1 is overexpressed in transformed cells and its targeted inhibition causes mitotic catastrophe and induction of apoptosis in melanoma cells, suggesting that Plk1 possibly plays an important role in melanocyctic cell proliferation. Significantly, our preliminary data show that melanocytic cells harboring B-Raf are hypersensitive to Plk1 inhibition than cells with wild type (WT) B-Raf, and that inhibition of B-RafV600E decreases cellular response to Plk1 inhibition. Based on our published and preliminary studies and available literature, in this application, we propose to challenge our central hypothesis that Plk1 acts as a synthetic lethality interaction partner of the oncogenic B- Raf. The following specific aims are proposed: 1) To determine the association between B-Raf mutation and Plk1 expression during melanocytic transformation; 2) To determine the extent to which the oncogenic B-Raf mutation enhances the sensitivity of the cellular response to mitotic stress, 3) To compare Plk1 loss-of-function phenotypes in melanoma cells with different B-Raf backgrounds; and 4) To assess the effects of Plk1 inhibition in a xenograft model with varying B-Raf. Outcome of this study is expected to enhance our understanding of mechanism of melanocytic transformation via dissecting interaction between Plk1 and B-Raf. This will be useful in designing novel strategies against proliferative melanocytic disorders, including melanomagenesis."
"9378714","Dr. Shetty's current research primarily comprises three themes:  (1) Mechanisms by which neural stem/progenitor cell (NSC) grafts ease seizures and memory and mood dysfunction in prototypes of chronic temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE): Previous work from Dr. Shetty's lab has shown that grafting of NSCs into the hippocampus of animals displaying spontaneous recurrent seizures (SRS) for an extended period of time (a model of drug-resistant epilepsy) has promise for reducing the frequency and intensity of SRS. Additional studies have shown that early intervention with grafting of GABA-ergic cells or NSCs restrains epileptogenic changes and the development of chronic epilepsy after status epilepticus. His current research is focused on further refining the neural cell grafting therapy for TLE. A project funded by the VA (Combined NSC Grafting and Neurogenic Drug Therapy for Temporal Lobe Epilepsy) investigates the long-term survival and functional effects of NSC grafts (derived from the embryonic rat medial ganglionic eminence) in a rat model of TLE, when grafted into the hippocampus along with two weeks peripheral administration of therapeutic compounds such as fibroblast growth factor-2 or neurosteroid ganaxolone. Another project funded by the DOD (Human iPSC-derived GABA-ergic Precursor Cell Therapy for Chronic Epilepsy) examines the efficacy of human GABA-ergic progenitors (derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells) for easing seizures and improving cognitive and mood function in a rat model of chronic TLE.  (2) Elucidating pathophysiological changes and examining the efficacy of promising compounds/drugs for easing cognitive and mood dysfunction in Gulf War Illness (GWI): A project funded by the VA (Memory and Mood Enhancing Strategies for GWI) examines mechanisms of brain dysfunction in a rat model of GWI. The results have shown that combined exposures to moderate doses of the anti nerve gas drug pyridostigmine bromide and pesticides (DEET and permethrin) with or without mild stress cause memory and mood dysfunction. Importantly, these changes are linked with declined neurogenesis (a substrate for maintaining normal memory and mood function), NSC dysfunction, chronic low-grade inflammation, increased oxidative stress and loss of GABA-ergic interneurons in the hippocampus. Recent studies have evaluated the efficacy of natural anti- inflammatory compounds (Resveratrol and Curcumin) and antidepressant therapy (voluntary physical exercise) for reversing memory and mood impairments through enhancement of neurogenesis and suppression of inflammation and oxidative stress. These studies have provided interesting positive results, which are currently in preparation for publications. Another recent project funded by the DOD (Monosodium Luminol for Improving Brain function in GWI) examines the efficacy of monosodium luminol (a drug that maintains redox homeostasis) in an animal model of GWI.  (3) Examining novel neuroprotective approaches that prevent the evolution of an initial injury into cognitive and mood dysfunction, using models of traumatic brain injury (TBI): The current studies (supported by Emerging Technology Funds from the State of Texas) are focused on two mouse models of TBI, which include a moderate TBI induced by controlled cortical Impact injury, and a mild TBI induced by exposure to blast shock waves (BSWs). Recent studies have suggested that single exposure to BSWs causes long-term cognitive and mood dysfunction associated with decreased neurogenesis in the hippocampus. Additional studies examine the efficacy of several approaches for preventing functional deficits in TBI prototypes. These include administration of anti-inflammatory compounds and exosomes derived from human mesenchymal stem cells."
"9379444","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): T cell receptor (TCR) ligation induces intracellular signaling cascades including the Ca2+-NFAT (nuclear factor of activated T cells) and MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) pathways that play crucial roles in activation and differentiation of T cells. Defects in these pathways lead to immune deficiency or hypersensitive immune responses in humans and mice. The small GTPases, Ras, Rac and Rho are known to play a central role in activation of TCR signaling pathways and are therapeutic targets in autoimmune diseases. These small GTPases are recruited into the immunological synapse (IS), the interface between an antigen-presenting cell and a T cell via interactions with signaling adaptors and activate the downstream MAPK pathway. However, in contrast to Ras, Rac and Rho GTPases, little is known about the role of more than 60 members of the Rab GTPase family in T cell activation. Our long-term goal is to uncover the role of Rab GTPases in TCR signaling to identify novel therapeutic targets to alleviate autoimmunity. We have recently identified a novel Rab GTPase, CRACR2A GTPase that plays a key role in TCR signaling. Our preliminary data show that CRACR2A GTPase is a lymphocyte-specific large Rab GTPase with many functional domains in contrast to small GTPases. We found that CRACR2A GTPase translocates into the IS to activate the downstream JNK (c- Jun N-terminal kinase) MAPK pathway. Furthermore, it is highly expressed in TH1 cells and plays an important role in expression of IFN-? and T-bet, and thus in autoimmunity. Our central hypothesis is that CRACR2A GTPase is recruited into the IS via protein interactions and regulates the JNK pathway to drive TH1 differentiation. The objective of this proposal is to identify 1) interacting partners, 2) GTP binding and prenylation-mediated regulation, and 3) the physiological role of CRACR2A GTPase in T cells using high resolution imaging techniques, genomics and conditionally targeted knockout mice. CRACR2A GTPase is the first example of a large molecule containing the small Rab GTPase domain. We expect to reveal a hitherto unknown mechanism of regulation of the JNK pathway in T cell differentiation. We are confident that we will also identify a unique signaling function of Rab GTPases, which are otherwise known to mediate only intracellular protein trafficking. These mechanistic studies will have significant impact on therapeutic exploitation of this novel GTPase to treat autoimmune diseases."
"9378787","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Reactivation of latent toxoplasmosis leads to encephalitis (TE) and is one of the most common life threatening central nervous system infections in HIV infected patients. Although incidence as a result of cART therapy has decreased substantially, it continues to be a problem in countries with high prevalence of infection. It is believed that reactivation of latent toxoplasmosis occurs during advanced stages of HIV infection, when CD8 T cell response is compromised. In mouse model of encephalitis, we have reported severe dysfunctionality in memory CD8+ T cell population due to graded up- regulation of PD-1 (a well-known inhibitory molecule) expression on these cells. Although PD-1-PDL-1 blockade invigorated CD8+ T cell response, highly exhausted memory CD8+ T cells could not be rescued. Preliminary data for the proposal demonstrates that in addition to PD-1, CD8+ T cells from susceptible animals exhibited increased expression of other inhibitory molecules like LAG-3, 2B4 and CTLA-4. Thus blockade of multiple inhibitors may be needed to restore the functionality of memory CD8+ T cells. Further, to develop effective therapies against this chronic infection, mechanism responsible for CD8 dysfunction needs to be defined. The proposal has three specific aims. In aim 1, kinetics and pattern of multiple inhibitory receptors expressed by memory CD8+ T cells from infected animals will be performed. This will provide important information about the antibody cocktail needed for reversing the dysfunctionality in this population. In aim 2, the mechanism of memory CD8+ T cell dysfunction during chronic toxoplasma infection will be evaluated. Based on our preliminary findings, in this specific aim the mechanism involved in the IL-21 mediated maintenance of CD8+T functionality will be deciphered. Finally in the third aim, underlying causes responsible for decreased IL-21 response in animals susceptible to TE with reference to CD40 signaling will be performed. Information generated from these studies will be highly beneficial to develop therapeutic regimen that will enable to maintain robust CD8+T cell memory against chronic toxoplasma infection, which continues to be a serious problem for HIV, infected population."
"9378789","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Solid organ transplantation is a life-saving procedure to treat end-stage organ failure. However, transplantation of organs between genetically distinct individuals results in acute graft rejection by the immune system unless patients take immunosuppressive drugs for the rest of their lives. The strength of the anti-transplant immune response, also called the alloresponse, is determined by both genetic and environmental factors. In mouse models of skin and heart transplantation, we have previously found that bacterial infections at the time of transplantation can enhance the alloresponse and promote transplant rejection. This supports the role of microbial infections as environmental factors that can modulate alloresponses, although these are not frequent environmental factors. In contrast, the communities of commensal bacteria that inhabit our body, collectively called the microbiota, share many microbial patterns with infectious bacteria, and are constantly present at barrier surfaces such as the skin and the intestine. Recent evidence indicates that the composition of the microbiota is determined by the immune system and that the microbiota, in turn, drives several effector functions of the immune system. Therefore, we have proposed the hypothesis that the microbiota is an important and omnipresent environmental factor that can enhance alloresponses and promote graft rejection. To address this question, we have used both sterile mice devoid of microbiota and conventional mice treated with broad spectrum antibiotics to reduce microbiota diversity. Our preliminary results show that both sets of mice display prolonged skin graft survival compared with control animals, demonstrating that the microbiota indeed enhances the strength of the alloresponse and accelerates graft rejection. In this application, we propose to investigate the mechanisms by which the microbiota promotes graft rejection, as well as the consequences on the composition of the microbiota of immunosuppression and ongoing alloresponses. Finally, we will attempt to manipulate the microbiota for therapeutic purposes to limit the strength of the alloresponse and prolong graft survival. This research will guide follow up studies in humans to identify the impact of microbiota on alloimmunity and graft outcome. As the composition of the microbiota can be manipulated via anti-microbials, as well as prebiotics (diet), probiotics (beneficial bacteria) and postbiotics (products of bacterial metabolism), this line of research has important possible clinical benefits."
"9378783","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Inherited trinucleotide repeat (TNR) instability, (i.e. expansions and deletions/contractions) is associated with more than 40 human familial neurodegenerative diseases and cancer. Non-inherited somatic TNR instability may be involved in the development of these diseases in the general public. No effective treatment for TNR- related diseases is yet available, partially because of a poor understanding of the underlying mechanisms. We have recently discovered that DNA base damage and base excision repair (BER) initiate and modulate somatic CAG repeat expansion and deletion by inducing single-strand DNA (ssDNA) breaks and promoting the formation of GC self-base-pairing hairpins. This indicates a new role of DNA base lesions, ssDNA breaks and BER in modulating TNR instability. To explore the potential of DNA damage and BER as new targets for the prevention and treatment of TNR-related diseases, in this project we seek to understand how environmentally and chemotherapeutically induced ssDNA breaks and their inefficient repair are involved in somatic TNR instability during BER. This goal will be achieved by pursuing three Specific Aims. Aim 1 is to determine if the accumulation of environmentally and chemotherapeutically induced DNA base lesions and ssDNA breaks can preferentially lead to CAG repeat instability in a site-specific manner. Site-specific accumulation of the ssDNA breaks in CAG/CTG repeat tracts induced by environmental toxicants and chemotherapeutic agents such as vinyl chloride and temozolomide will be determined. The unique patterns of ssDNA break accumulation induced by DNA-damaging agents will be correlated with repeat expansion and deletion to identify damage- specific position effects on CAG repeat instability. The effects will be further examined under imbalanced levels of BER enzymes and cofactors to determine if TNR instability can be modulated by compromised BER efficiency. Aim 2 is to test the hypothesis that inefficient BER facilitates CAG repeat deletion by promoting the formation of multiple non-B-form DNA structures. This will be done by determining if inefficient DNA synthesis by DNA polymerases (Pol  genetic variants, Pol ?) can facilitate the accumulation of a template hairpin and promote TNR deletion. Aim 3 is to determine if TNR expansion and deletion can be prevented by efficiently disrupting non-B-form DNA structures through BER protein-protein interactions and functional coordination. This project addresses the fundamental mechanisms underlying DNA damage-induced somatic TNR instability by dissecting the interplay among environmental and chemotherapeutic DNA damage, BER, and TNR instability. The results will provide important new insights into how exposure to environmental and chemotherapeutic stresses may influence the development and progression of TNR-related human diseases in the general population, and how these adverse effects can be prevented by DNA damage repair. This will help to identify novel targets for prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of TNR-related diseases, and provide new information for risk assessment of environmentally and chemotherapeutically induced genotoxic effects."
"9386753","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Perinatal Research Society (PRS) consists of pediatricians, obstetricians, and basic scientists who are the nation's leaders in all aspects of perinatal research and have a wealth of experience in NIH funding and trainee mentoring. The overall purpose of the PRS annual meeting is twofold, 1) to provide productive interchange between scientists of different disciplines sharing a common research interest in perinatal biology, and 2) to encourage development and collaboration opportunities for Young Investigators (YI's) to build careers in perinatal research. The PRS annual meeting provides many important career development opportunities through it design. The YI program begins at a premeeting Workshop in which intensive one-on-one mentoring/teaching by senior PRS members leads to tangible progress in the YIs developing and expressing their own research ideas. However, it is in the Main Meeting that they become integrated with the society membership as a whole. The program itself presents the latest advances in the field but also provides the opportunity for some YI's to present their research ideas. Beyond the speaker program all YI's are constantly encouraged to network with the many established and indeed prominent researchers who have excelled at building successful careers. The intentional programmatic acknowledgement of and presentations by YI's within the Main Meeting, combined with many informal and formal interaction opportunities in a relaxed retreat-like setting contributes to YI professional development and creates opportunities to develop individual collaborations and mentoring relationships with senior colleagues. This is critical to future research career success.  We seek funding to support a lectureship as part of the Main Meeting program, but also predominantly to support Young Investigators (YI) attendance and participation in the Main Meeting. The need for this kind of opportunity for early career development is significant because of the times in which we live. Many YI's are giving up their goal of a career in perinatal research. We believe this combined approach or premeeting Workshop and then Main Meeting attendance and further mentoring is unique, and we will track outcomes norms over the next five years to see if they exceed NIH norms."
"9427654","ABSTRACT Despite improvements in infection control, one child dies every minute from malaria, which is caused by infection by Plasmodium parasites. Children develop immunity to malaria slowly after multiple exposures, and lose immunity in the absence of continuous exposure. A lack of critical knowledge about the antibody response that controls this infection hinders vaccine development. Early IFN-? from Th1 cells limits early parasite growth and correlates with protection. CD4 T helper cells (Th) also promote parasite-specific antibody, which we have proposed is primarily required for full parasite clearance, which takes over a month. IL-21 promotes B cell responses and is also required for clearance of Plasmodium. Splenic germinal centers optimize B:T cell interactions that promote isotype switching and affinity maturation of antibodies, and long-lived plasma cell generation. However, the appearance of GCs is delayed until late in infection by the Th1 response. This slow response may explain the delay of development of immunity observed in the field. However, there is a significant extrafollicular antibody response that is faster, and actually corresponds with dramatic control of the parasite. In addition, our preliminary data showing that knockout mice lacking germinal centers (GC) control infection, led us to develop a working model of protection consisting of three phases. First, Th1 cytokines limit parasite growth; next, GC-independent factors control the parasite to low, but chronic levels without pathology; when finally, GCs play a role in complete clearance. Yet, the types of Th cells required, and the dominant mechanisms of antibody-mediated parasite killing are not yet clear, especially in the control phase. The role of IL-21 in an extrafollicular response has not been sufficiently studied to understand the mechanisms or importance. Therefore, we hypothesize that GC-independent mechanisms driven by IL-21 make a significant contribution to the control of Plasmodium infection. To test this, in Aim 1, we will compare the contribution of GCs and IL-21 for control of parasite. We will determine the importance of GC-driven antibody changes by using novel mouse models separately deficient in isotype switching and affinity maturation. There are also important unanswered questions about the type of Th cells that help B cells make antibody in malaria infection. We and others have recently discovered that the effector T helper cell response to mouse and human malaria is composed largely of a hybrid IFN-?+ IL-21+ Th1/Tfh cell type that has all the hallmarks of both Th1 and Tfh. While IFN-? was recently shown to inhibit GC formation, the role of hybrid IFN-?+/IL-21+ T cells' contribution to antibody production in vivo, and their role in protection from parasitemia and pathology in malaria, have not been tested. Therefore, In Aim 2 we will evaluate the efficacy of hybrid IFN-?+/IL-21+ Th1/Tfh in protection, by sorting them using cytokine reporter mice, and determine the phases of infection where IL-21 is critical. Understanding the mechanisms of both the control phase and final clearance is critical because control of parasite corresponds with termination of malaria pathology and may suggest novel vaccine strategies."
"9568227","PROJECT SUMIVIARY (See Instructions):  The overarching goal of our proposed project, SuCCESS: Studying Colorectal Cancer: Effectiveness of Screening Strategies, is to develop evidence to inform personalized screening recommendations that maintain most or all of the benefits of intensive screening, minimize risks and costs, and respect patient preferences. Based within Group Health Research Institute (GHRI), the SuCCESS project will draw on a  wide array of rich electronic data sources available at Group Health (GH), an integrated health care delivery system in Washington State, to gather information about risk factors, screening patterns, diagnostic procedures, pathology, treatment, and cancer outcomes among GH enrollees. The SuCCESS project will use GH data to describe colorectal cancer (CRC) screening as practiced, including behaviors and effectiveness, and will build on this information to examine the potential for personalized screening regimens.   We propose 3 linked projects related to this overall goal. Project 1, Comparative effectiveness of colorectal cancer screening as practiced, will provide information about how screening is practiced, about patient decisions regarding screening modalities, and about the comparative effectiveness of different screening  regimens as practiced. Project 2: Personalizing colorectal cancer screening and surveillance, will focus on identifying effective personalized screening regimens based on screening history and other individual risk factors. Project 3, Modeling long-term comparative effectiveness of colorectal screening, will use disease simulation models to predict the long-term effectiveness of different screening and surveillance regimens on botii overall and CRC mortality based on results from Project 1 and Project 2, and will develop a cohort model for CRC that will be freely distributed. Our proposed body of research will provide an important foundation for personalized clorectal cancer screening, and will produce results that are useful to a multidisciplinary audience, including clinicians, patients, policy makers, researchers, and professional medical organizations."
"9390464","Abstract Infection with HIV-1 elicits complex, fine-tuned immune responses that involve virtually all components of the innate and adaptive immune system. Yet, this immune response fails in most cases to control the infection, and there are reasons to believe that in many cases, immune responses to HIV contribute to disease pathogenesis by increasing abnormal immune activation and facilitating the establishment of a long-lasting reservoir of HIV-1 infected cells, thus propagating a disease they are meant to restrict. While innate and adaptive effector cell responses against HIV-1 have been analyzed in detail in the last years, there is still a remarkable knowledge gap in the understanding of molecular events and host-pathogen interactions inside CD4 T cells that determine the efficacy of the HIV-1 life cycle and influence the fate and survival of HIV-1 infected cells. However, immune responses to HIV-1 within the actual viral target cells arguably represent one of the most active and one of the most effective antiviral immune defense mechanisms that may have a profound effect on the dynamics of clinical HIV-1 disease progression. Here, we propose to take advantage of recent methodological advances for high- throughput, ultra-sensitive protein and phosphoprotein profiling to analyze molecular events and cell-intrinsic immune responses to HIV-1 inside the main target cells for HIV-1. In Specific Aim 1, we will focus on phosphorylation of HIV-1 gene products by host kinases. We hypothesize that specific sequence motifs within the HIV-1 proteome are susceptible to phosphorylation by host kinases in vivo, and represent sites of extraordinary viral vulnerability that have a profound impact on viral fitness; identifying such sites may have important implications for generating a comprehensive view of the HIV-1 fitness landscape and for selecting viral sequences to be included in vaccines and immunogens. In Specific Aim 2, we will analyze proteomic and phosphoproteomic responses to productive HIV-1 infection, and test the hypothesis that HIV-1 infection induces specific molecular pathways that maintain survival and homeostasis of infected cells. These studies build on a substantial set of provocative preliminary data indicating that proteomic signatures of HIV-1 infected cells show selective activation of cell survival programs, and hold promise for identifying molecular targets for reducing viability and persistence of virally infected cells. In Specific Aim 3, we will focus on analyzing the proteomic and phosphoproteomic signatures of latently-infected CD4 T cells, which are regarded as the main reason for our current insufficiency to eradicate and cure HIV-1 infection. These studies have the potential to discover novel functional pathways that are involved in regulation of viral latency and persistence, and will provide data that may significantly enhance our ability to detect, monitor and therapeutically eliminate latently-infected cells."
"9588492","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overarching goal of this proposal is to investigate the Hippo signaling pathway in the liver and how it contributes to the pathogenesis of hepatic fibrosis. The outcome of these studies will impact on our understanding of hepatic development and recovery after injury. The Hippo signaling pathway is an important regulator of liver size, cellular proliferation and cell fate. The Hippo pathway negatively regulates Yap. High levels of Yap in hepatocytes convert these cells into a hepatic progenitor cell (HPC)-like phenotype. Rapidly dividing HPCs are associated with the development of fibrosis, and it is known that Yap directly activates genes associated with this process. Cirrhotic liver samples often display nuclear Yap staining (a sign of Hippo inactivation) and hepatic stellate cell (HSC) activation is temporally associated with increasing Yap. These observations suggest that inactivating Hippo signaling in epithelial cells can activate a profibrotic gene program. This proposal will validate and dissect the mechanism of this observation. In AIM 1, several fibrogenic liver injury models will be examined to see if Hippo signaling is inactivated. This will be complemented with loss of function studies in the epithelial compartment to determine if abrogating Hippo signaling will minimize the development of fibrosis. In AIM 2, Yap-expressing hepatocytes will be examined by cellular fractionation and using single-cell sequencing techniques to determine if a priori, a particular hepatocyte type is most sensitive to Yap expression and if this cell-type likely orchestrates the development of liver fibrosis. AIM 3, focuses on determining which secreted factors from Yap-expressing hepatocytes likely activate HSCs. This will be performed using RNA interference and Cas9-Crispr technologies to knockdown expression of candidate molecules defined by microarray expression and ChIP-Seq data from Yap overexpressing hepatocytes. This screen will be performed in vitro followed by in vivo validation. Understanding if Hippo signaling is a common mechanism for the development of hepatic fibrosis, the characteristics of the epithelial cells that may orchestrate this process, and potential secreted factors to activate HSCs will be important information in developing therapeutics to treat liver fibrosis."
"9378784","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Misrepair of DNA damage is a hallmark of tumor cells. DNA damage can occur from many endogenous and exogenous sources including environmental toxicants. Alkylation damage caused by a myriad of industrial and consumer based sources is pervasive in the environment. DNA alkylation leads to replication stress and DNA damage. If DNA is alkylated during replication, then the replication fork can collapse and many repair mechanisms can be utilized to repair the damaged DNA. How a cell commits to a specific repair pathway is not completely understood. In budding yeast, the Shu complex is critical in the repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSB) created by processing of replication forks damaged by DNA alkylating agents. This complex is highly conserved throughout eukaryotes and contains the Rad51 paralogues, proteins that are structurally similar to the central DNA repair protein Rad51. In this study, the investigators aim to elucidate the role of the yeast and human Shu complexes in repair of DNA alkylation damage at a replication fork. They are testing the hypothesis that the Shu complex is a critical key regulator of error-free DNA repair by shuttling DNA intermediates into homologous recombination pathway through its unique protein-protein interactions. Consistent with this hypothesis, mutation of the Shu complex proteins leads to repair by alternative error-prone repair mechanisms. The investigators will test the model that the Shu complex plays an essential role in the DNA repair pathway choice by 1) characterizing the association of the Shu complex with a damaged replication fork and the importance of its protein-protein interactions at the fork and 2) solving the structure of the Shu complex DNA binding subunits while bound to a replication fork-like substrate. These studies will elucidate how the Shu complex interactions with DNA and its protein-protein interactions direct these DNA intermediates into distinct repair mechanisms. Using what is learned in yeast to quickly and efficiently identify key substrates, residues, and protein targets, the investigators will expand their studies into human cell lines where they will investigate the role of the human Shu complex and RAD51 paralogues in repair of alkylation damage caused by environmental toxicants. The investigators will specifically characterize mutations and small nucleotide polymorphisms in the hRAD51 paralogues, which may make these individuals hypersensitive to DNA alkylators and could therefore increase cancer risk. Collectively, these studies will provide key insights into the role of the Shu complex in repair of DNA alkylation damage and elucidate how this complex promotes error-free DNA repair to prevent genetic instability. In addition, the investigators will identify at-risk individuals harboing mutations in these important genes that may be more sensitive to DNA alkylation damage and therefore susceptible to human disease."
"9448601","Project Summary/Abstract Interleukin-37 (IL-37), a member of the IL-1 family, has been a neglected cytokine mostly because there is no mouse homologue for IL-37. However, we expressed human IL-37 in mice, which revealed that IL-37 broadly suppresses innate inflammation and acquire immunity and that recombinant human IL-37 accomplishes the same in wild type mice. Similar to IL-1? and IL-33, IL-37 is a dual function cytokine in that IL-37 translocates to the nucleus but also binds its cell surface receptor complex. The present application focuses on the mechanism for these properties. The translocation of IL-37 to the nucleus depends on caspase-1 cleavage followed by the carboxyl domain binding to chromatin. To determine to what extent nuclear IL-37 contributes to suppression of innate and acquire immunity, we have generated a new strain of mice that lacks the ability for IL-37 to translocate to the nucleus by to mutating the caspase-1 recognition site on IL-37 without altering the activity of caspase-1 in the same cell. In order to establish an independent role for nuclear IL-37, the cell surface receptors for IL-37 (IL-18 Receptor ??chain) will be prevented using a blocking antibody in short-term models. In both short and long-term models, we will use mice deficient in IL-1R8, the IL-37 co-receptor. The second Aim of this proposal directly addresses the binding of IL-37 to the IL-18 Binding Protein (IL-18BP) and investigates whether administration of IL-18BP reduces the protection afforded by endogenous IL-37. We have generated a transgenic mouse expressing human IL-18BP to determine whether administration of recombinant human IL-37 is less effective in mice expressing human IL-18BP. Since recombinant human IL-37 possesses several properties to suppress innate and acquired immunity, the translational component of the proposal is the development of IL-37 as a therapeutic. As with several members of the IL-1 family, the N- and C-terminal for optimal biologic activity is unknown. We have produced a recombinant form of IL-37 fused to the Fc domain of human IgG1 (IL-37Fc fusion protein) and demonstrated its efficacy. We will now determine the N- and C-termini of IL-37 for an optimal form of recombinant IL-37 to limit of innate inflammation. Once this has been established, an improved IL-37Fc fusion protein will also be produced and tested in preclinical models. The overall goal of these studies is to advance the biology and clinical significance of IL-37 as well as to exploit its anti- inflammatory properties as a therapeutic."
"9377533","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In the absence of an effective vaccine, administration of antiretroviral drugs prior to human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) exposure (pre-exposure prophylaxis or PrEP) may be a reliable method to protect high-risk HIV-negative individuals from infection. Daily oral tenofovir and FTC (Truvada) is currently approved for use as PrEP in high-risk individuals but has had limited success in human clinical trials to date, mainly due to adherence issues.  Rilpivirine (RPV) is the most recent reverse transcriptase inhibitor approved for antiretroviral therapy (ART) for HIV-1. Drug-resistant mutations detected in patients failing RPV-containing regimens conferred mainly low-level resistance to RPV and RPV is active against most mutants selected by other drugs. RPV has been formulated into injectable long-acting nanoparticles (RPV-LA) for use as long-lasting PrEP to be administered by healthcare providers. Development of resistance or transmission of RPV-resistant variants during PrEP has not been previously addressed, particularly their impact on subsequent ART. A case has recently been described of a woman who became HIV-1-infected during RPV-LA treatment and subsequently developed RPV-resistant virus in the presence of sub-therapeutic plasma RPV concentration. We propose to investigate vaginal transmission of wild-type (WT) HIV-1 and drug-resistant variants in the presence and absence of therapeutic and subtherapeutic concentrations of RPV-LA PrEP or Truvada, using a novel animal model that will also allow us to investigate the dynamics of infection and dissemination in the female genital tract in real-time.  Using an innovative new reporter virus system and a well-characterized humanized mouse model, we hypothesize that a prevalent HIV-1 mutant resistant to both RPV and Truvada (E138K/M184I) will be transmitted in the absence of drug and in the presence of Truvada PrEP, but will lead to an abortive infection of local CD4+ target cells in the genital trac in the presence of therapeutic RPV-LA concentrations. However, transmission or development of drug-resistant HIV-1 will lead to faster virologic failure during subsequent ART."
"9378087","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Most retroviral infections result in indefinite viral persistence with an undetectable or inefficient anti-virus immune response. Poor immune reactivity has made the elucidation of protective anti-retroviral pathways an incredibly arduous endeavor. There are, however, rare individuals capable of mounting a potent anti-retroviral immune response, and the study of these individuals has allowed dissection of the protective responses. For example, some Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)-infected individuals termed `long-term or elite non-progressors' are able to initiate and maintain robust anti-viral responses via specific genetic mechanisms. Whereas studies of retrovirus resistance in humans are complicated by genetic diversity, inbred mice offer an experimentally tractable alternative for mapping mammalian resistance and susceptibility genes. Two examples of such models are mice from the C57BL/6J (B6) and I/LnJ strains, which successfully constrain retroviruses via production of neutralizing antibody (Ab) responses. Whereas the gene responsible for controlling Murine Leukemia Virus (MuLV) in B6 mice has been identified (apobec3), the gene underlying retrovirus resistance in I/LnJ mice remains unknown. We have previously described a virus infectivity controller 1 (vic1) locus, containing a recessive retrovirus resistance-conferrng gene in I/LnJ mice and mapped it to Chromosome 17. Unlike apobec3, vic1 confers resistance to two distinct retroviruses, MuLV and Mouse Mammary Tumor Virus (MMTV). Although an initial poly-isotypic anti-virus immune response is observed in susceptible mice, it is short-lived and does not class-switch to an IgG2a response as it does in resistant ILn/J mice. Unlike virus-susceptible mice, I/LnJ mice infected with either retrovirus produce virus-neutralizing Abs, sustain this response throughout their life, and prevent infection of progeny by coating secreted virions with anti-virus Abs. Using congenic and bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) transgenic approaches, we fine- mapped the vic1 locus to a 32.9Kb region between 34,211,575 -34,244,528 Kbs. A non-classical major histocompatibility class II (MHCII) gene, H2-Ob (Ob) mapped within the region was identified as the gene encoding for Vic1 by virtue of its known function, unique polymorphism and a phenotype rescue experiment. Peptide loading of MHCII molecules in the endosomes of antigen presenting cells (APCs) is catalyzed by H2-M. The evolutionally conserved Ob encodes the O? molecule that together with O?, comprises the heterodimeric H2-O molecule. H2-O is a MHCII mimic and binds to H2-M thereby inhibiting MHCII peptide presentation. The biological relevance of H2-O inhibition of MHCII peptide loading is poorly understood. Importantly, the role of H2-O during the immune response against any pathogen is completely unexplored. The successful completion of aims described in this application will reveal the mechanism by which the MHC-like molecule, H2-O controls the immune response to retroviruses."

"9355478","Veterans are particularly susceptible to neuropathic pain originating from combat wounds, surgery and diabetes. The long-term goal of this project is to find a cure for neuropathic pain that represents its true reversal and not just palliative measures. This goal can be achieved by investigating the molecular and cellular mechanisms of pain latent sensitization, a rodent model that reproduces key features of chronic pain disorders: indefinite duration and episodic presentation triggered by stress. Latent sensitization can occur following a variety of stimuli: inflammation, skin incision and nerve injuries that cause neuropathic pain. It is characterized by a period of hyperalgesia followed by a period of pain remission in which pain is generally absent but may reappear as pain episodes. This is due to the fact that the remission phase of latent sensitization does not represent a return to normality but an anomalous state in which pain is suppressed by a compensatory activation of opioid receptors. This is revealed by a return of pain (?reinstatement?) upon administration of opioid antagonists, which are without effect in normal animals or humans. The latent sensitization model emerged from the work of several research teams on opiate-induced hyperalgesia and its interaction with injury and stress. Only recently has the importance of latent sensitization as a model for chronic pain become clear, and there is only one study on its relevance for neuropathic pain. This project will investigate the mechanisms of latent sensitization in neuropathic pain. The Specific Aims are: 1) study the role of opioid receptors and stress in neuropathic latent sensitization; 2) determine whether the remission phase of latent sensitization is mediated by opioid release or by -opioid receptor constitutive activity; and 3) study the role of NMDARs and the adenylyl cyclase / protein kinase A pathway in neuropathic latent sensitization. We will test the following hypotheses: 1) -opioid receptors, ?-opioid receptors and ?2A adrenergic receptors in the spinal cord mediate anti-hyperalgesia during the remission phase of nerve injury-induced latent sensitization; 2) -opioid receptors located in primary afferent terminals contribute to the remission phase of latent sensitization; 3) stress reinstates pain hyperalgesia during the remission phase of latent sensitization; 4) -opioid receptor constitutive activity, and not sustained opioid release, mediates pain remission; 5) pain sensitivity in latent sensitization is maintained by a positive feedback loop in which NMDARs and the adenylyl cyclase / protein kinase A pathway activate each other. This project will use a multidisciplinary approach to test these hypotheses. In Aim 1, a spared nerve injury model of neuropathic pain will be used in rats and mice to identify the receptors that suppress pain sensitivity in the remission phase. Using transgenic mice with selective deletion of -opioid receptors in nociceptive primary afferents, we will determine whether the -opioid receptors that suppress pain are located in primary afferents. We will also investigate how stress reinstates pain during the remission phase. In Aim 2, we will determine whether the anti-hyperalgesia produced by -opioid receptors is due to their constitutive activity by using patch-clamp recording from primary afferent neurons to measure their inhibition of voltage-gated calcium channels. The alternative hypothesis, that -opioid receptors are activated by sustained opioid release, will be tested using knock-out mice in the three genes that encode opioid peptides. In addition, opioid release will be measured as -opioid receptor internalization. In Aim 3, the interaction between NMDA receptors, adenylyl cyclase and protein kinase A during latent sensitization will be studied in primary afferent neurons using calcium imaging and patch-clamp. The activating phosphorylation of NMDA receptors by protein kinase A during latent sensitization will be measured with Western blots. Finally, NMDA receptor antagonists and inhibitors and activators of adenylyl cyclase and protein kinase A will be used to delineate the signal pathway that maintains latent sensitization. This will identify targets to develop medication to reverse neuropathic pain."
"9345715","The general purpose of this study is to establish, validate and translate to clinical protocol, MR imaging biomarkers that non-invasively reflect structure, function, and adaptive relationships between meniscus, cartilage and subchondral bone based upon structural, histologic, and biomechanical reference standards. This proposal incorporates our experience from past cartilage and meniscus research to develop a unified theory, that of the meniscal osteochondral unit (M-OCU). This theory emphasizes the dynamic relationship between meniscus, cartilage, subchondral bone and bone marrow. It is supported by structural and mechanical relationships in the meniscus covered and uncovered osteochondral surfaces of the tibia, as well as by pathologic phenotypes in knee OA. The development of a single study protocol that allows non-invasive evaluation of the components of the M-OCU will facilitate understanding the degree and type of adaptation that occurs in these tissues in the setting of an altered mechanical axis in meniscus-injured patients. The overall hypothesis is that the intact M-OCU preserves a normal mechanical axis in the knee, and further that the pattern of meniscal failure (acuity, location, character) will predict the response of the subjacent osteochondral surface (adaptive response versus failure). Four specific aims are proposed: 1) cadaveric knees, we will determine if high resolution 3D Cube MR measures of the subchondral bone and trabecular bone can serve as biomarkers for structure and biomechanical function of tissue, for characterizing the structures of the subchondral (SC) bone plate and SC trabecular bone using micro CT as a reference standard, 2) cadaveric knees, will determine if MR measures of bone marrow can serve as biomarkers for marrow composition, and together with bone structure, improve the prediction of biomechanical function of the surrounding trabecular bone, 3) to evaluate the M-OCU (meniscus, cartilage, SC bone plate, SC trabecular bone, and bone marrow) using morphologic and quantitative MR sequences with histologic, imaging, and biomechanical reference standards, and 4) to translate MR imaging evaluation of the M-OCU with a novel load-bearing technique, to 2 meniscal repair cohorts pre- and post-treatment over time to characterize degree and patterns of adaptive remodeling. Aims 1 and 2 will establish sensitivity of MR techniques, magnified by novel hardware and software optimization, to structure and function of SC bone plate and SC trabecular bone. Aim 3 will be a translational aim, to perform whole-joint MR analysis of M-OCU in normal vs. pathologic knees of cadavers. Aim 4 will apply all of the developed techniques to meniscus-deficient patient cohorts, one receiving traditional meniscectomy vs. another receiving meniscus-conserving treatments, which is hypothesized to better preserve mechanical axis, lead to gradual adaptation of M-OCU, and better clinical outcome."
"9350780","Erythropoietin is the most widely prescribed cytokine, yet the benefits and potential side effects of different dosing regimens are poorly understood. Clinically, it is now recognized that erythropoietin administered at high doses results in an increased probability of cancer recurrence and in patients with chronic kidney disease, an increased risk of morbidity and mortality from heart disease and stroke. However, the mechanisms that mediate this increased risk of cardiovascular disease is not known. There are two receptors for erythropoietin the homodimeric erythropoietin receptor (EPOR) and the heterodimeric beta common receptor (?CR)/EPOR. We have demonstrated that activation of the heterodimeric ?CR/EPOR only occurs with high doses of erythropoietin. Our exciting, published, preliminary data also demonstrates that the ?CR is in a complex with vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 and that high doses of erythropoietin activate vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 through the ?CR, resulting in all of the deleterious effects of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 activation on the cardiovascular system. This is particularly important in patients with kidney disease since they are already at a high risk of cardiovascular disease. Moreover in advanced kidney disease cyanate derived from the high urea levels can non-enzymatically form an amide bond with erythropoietin. This carbamylated erythropoietin has no effect on hemoglobin, but still activates the heterodimeric ?CR/EPOR. To date there have been no studies that have directly measured levels of carbamylated erythropoietin or activation of the ?CR/EPOR in patients with kidney disease. Our hypothesis is that the administration of low-doses of erythropoietin more frequently will result in lower levels of total and carbamylated erythropoietin decreased activation of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 via the heterodimeric ?CR/EPOR and consequently decreased inflammation and atherosclerosis. We will directly test this hypothesis by randomly allocating 100 patients with chronic kidney disease to either low- dose erythropoietin given thrice weekly or the same cumulative dose, a high-dose, administered once every 2 weeks. Our hypothesis predicts that low-dose erythropoietin will be as effective at correcting anemia, but will demonstrate less progression of carotid artery plaque, as assessed by non-contrast magnetic resonance imaging, as compared to the high-dose, erythropoietin every 2 weeks. To delineate how erythropoietin affects blood vessels, we will isolate endothelial cells from blood vessels in 20 patients who are assigned to low-dose erythropoietin and 20 allocated to high-dose erythropoietin. Within these cells we will investigate the signaling pathways that are triggered by activation of ?CR/EPOR. In a substudy of 10 subjects randomized to low-dose erythropoietin or high-dose erythropoietin, as well as 10 healthy controls receiving a single dose of high- or low-dose erythropoietin, we will determine how kidney function and dosing affects levels of total and carbamylated erythropoietin. Our study will not only provide us with a thorough understanding of the mechanism by which erythropoietin mediates the increased risk of atherosclerosis, but a clinical strategy to avoid the side effects of erythropoietin therapy and a tool to quantify the cardiovascular risk of erythropoietin and newer erythropoiesis stimulating agents by assessing activation of the heterodimeric ?CR/EPOR."
"9378788","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Influenza virus infections have a major impact on human health and the threat of pandemic infections remains imminent. Antibody inducing Influenza A virus (IAV) vaccines are available, however protection is suboptimal and requires annual reformulation of the vaccine. IAV can escape neutralization by preexisting antibodies due to the high rate of mutation in the primary targets of neutralization (hemagglutinin, HA and neuraminidase, NA) and due to its capacity to recombine in non-human hosts. In the absence of neutralizing antibodies, memory CD8 T-cell specific for epitopes located in conserved regions of IAV proteins like the internal components nucleoprotein (NP), polymerase A and matrix protein can confer protection. Recent human challenge studies and longitudinal analyses during the 2009 H1N1 IAV pandemic support the notion that cross-reactive memory CD8 T cells are capable of ameliorating disease when pre-existing antibodies are absent. As most humans carry a small number of these broadly protective memory CD8 T-cells, increasing the number of these cells through boosting is an attractive strategy to bolster their protective capacity. However, memory CD8 T-cells constitute a very heterogeneous population and little is known about how boosting or multiple antigen exposures effects CD8 T-cell mediated protection against IAV, For instance, we have recently reported that the type of booster agent significantly affects the localization and protective capacity of the resulting memory CD8 T-cell population (Sl?tter et al, 2013). Therefore, our long-term goal is to determine optimal memory CD8 T-cell characteristics for protection against IAV and to understand how such memory populations can be generated. In turn, these studies will provide crucial information to optimize broadly protective vaccines for IAV. Specific Aim 1.  Determine the molecular mechanisms regulating CXCR3 expression in memory CD8 T  cells to enhance airway localization.  Specific Aim 2. Determine the impact of repetitive IAV infections on the generation of airway---surveilling, tissue resident and circulatin memory CD8 T cells and their relative contribution in protection from IAV."
"9268451","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     The care of Veterans with epilepsy is a priority for the Department of Veterans Affairs as attested by the creation of several Epilepsy Centers of Excellence (ECoE) across the country. The constant but seemingly unpredictable re-occurrence of seizures dramatically impacts the autonomy and quality of life of Veterans and civilians suffering from epilepsy. Unfortunately, 25-35% of patients with epilepsy continue to have seizures despite maximal medical therapy (Annegers 2001). Regional surgical resection, besides carrying significant risk, is curative in only ~ 40-70% of cases (Engel et al., 2003). Even when pharmacological or surgical methods work, side effects can be severe. Alternative seizure prevention and warning systems would be highly desirable to restore quality of life and autonomy of Veterans and civilians with intractable epilepsy. Seizure prevention and warning systems based on intracranial EEG (iEEG) recordings have been intensively examined in the past 30 years, yet reliable seizure prediction and early detection remain elusive. Overall, progress has been hampered by the difficulty of monitoring the activity of ensembles of single neurons in humans. We will use a novel technology, intracortical 96-microelectrode arrays (MEAs), to examine human epilepsy at a much higher spatial resolution than in iEEG recordings. We will record the activity of ensembles of single neurons (single units, SUs), and multichannel multi-unit (MU) and high-density field potentials (LFPs) in patients with pharmacologically intractable focal epilepsy undergoing pre-resection surgery monitoring. AIM 1 will study how seizures start, spread and terminate at multiple scales, from the microphysiological level of ensembles of SUs, MUs and LFPs to the macroscopic dynamics reflected in iEEGs signals. We will test the hypothesis that neuronal ensemble dynamics preceding seizure onset change gradually and that these changes can be detected several minutes before the seizure onset. We further hypothesize that this transition should manifest in changes in spatiotemporal correlations among SUs, MUs and LFPs. AIM 2a will develop and test a new framework for seizure prediction and early warning based on multi-scale MEA neural signals in people with focal epilepsy. AIM 2b will compare this new framework for seizure prediction with state of the art prediction approaches based exclusively on iEEG. This comparison will reveal the advantages and disadvantages of seizure prediction approaches that include MEA neural signals versus approaches that do not."
"9377528","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Approximately 1/5 of adults hospitalized for community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) experience cardiac arrhythmia, congestive heart failure, and/or myocardial infarction and this contributes substantially to mortality. We have made the novel and seminal observation that Streptococcus pneumoniae, the leading cause of CAP, can enter the myocardium during invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) and forms microscopic vacuolar lesions (i.e. microlesions) filled with extracellular pneumococci. In mice with IPD, cardiac microlesion formation was concomitant with aberrant cardiac electrophysiology indicative of ongoing heart failure. In stark contrast to cardiac infections caused by other bacteria, S. pneumoniae cardiac microlesion formation is remarkable due to the complete absence of infiltrated immune cells. Why this occurs is unknown, yet the lack of a host response is undoubtedly permissive for heart damage. We hypothesize that S. pneumoniae forms an immunoquiescent biofilm within the cardiac microlesion. Our preliminary results support this notion and demonstrate that biofilm S. pneumoniae (BF-Spn) does not incite NF?B activation from host cells nor results in the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Our goal is to discern the host-pathogen interactions that occur during cardiac microlesion formation and identify targets for intervention. Aim 1: Determine the requirement for biofilm formation during pneumococcal cardiac microlesion formation. We will examine cardiac microlesions for the presence of biofilm extracellular matrix components and test isolated S. pneumoniae for the biofilm phenotype. We will test the ability of S. pneumoniae mutants deficient in the ability to form biofilms in vitro for their ability to form cardiac microlesions in vivo. We will compare the cytokine and chemokine response of cardiomyocytes exposed to planktonic (P-Spn) and BF-Spn. This aim will directly test if S. pneumoniae within cardiac microlesions are in an immunoquiescent biofilm. Aim 2: Characterize S. pneumoniae within cardiac microlesions and identify novel virulence determinants required for their formation. Using RNA-sequencing we will characterize and then compare the gene expression profile of S. pneumoniae in cardiac microlesions to those in the blood of infected mice. Genes with high in vivo gene expression will be deleted and isogenic mutants tested for the ability to cause cardiac microlesions. This aim will characterize how S. pneumoniae adapts to growth within the heart and identify in an unbiased manner targets for intervention. Aim 3: Characterize the cardiomyocyte response to pneumolysin exposure. We will measure the cytokine/chemokine response and susceptibility of cardiomyocytes to pneumolysin, the S. pneumoniae pore forming toxin, and bacterial cell wall. We will test if S. pneumoniae activates the NLRP3 inflammasome within cardiomyocytes. We will determine if sub-lytic levels of pneumolysin trigger the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis in cardiomyocytes. This aim will discern if cardiomyocytes exposed to S. pneumoniae undergo a cell death program that is not inflammatory."
"9460110","ABSTRACT Since the discovery of induced pluripotent stem cells, a major goal for regenerative medicine has been to replace damaged or diseased tissues with patient-derived cells. In principle, it should be possible to generate functional tissues for clinical use through directed differentiation protocols that specifically alter the fate of pluripotent cells. Unfortunately, there are many challenges associated with directed differentiation. First, we do not fully understand all of the signaling mechanisms that participate in developmental regulatory pathways. We therefore cannot always identify the correct combination of molecular factors that will recapitulate these signals in a laboratory setting. Even if the required factors are known, it is unclear what doses, timing, or combinations of factors will produce an efficient differentiation. Most protocols are developed by trial-and-error; take years to optimize; and lead to incomplete, inefficient, or heterogeneous mixtures of the desired cell types. Clearly, there is a critical need for improving differentiation procedures if we expect to produce realistic cell-based therapies. In this essay, I propose a novel solution for controlling the fate of human stem cells. The approach, which we have pioneered in our lab, works by allowing a computational model to design the differentiation protocol. To build the model, we use time-lapse microscopy to monitor the expression of key developmental markers over the time course of differentiation. These data provide a mechanistic description of cellular fate decisions at single-cell resolution. To train the model, we then apply a series of systematic perturbations to differentiating cells, monitor the cells by live-cell microscopy, and integrate these new measurements into the working model. Finally, we use the model as a predictive tool by performing thousands of virtual experiments to identify a set of perturbations that are predicted to alter stem cell fate in a prescribed way. Model predictions are validated through single-cell transcription profiling, and these data are used to iteratively refine the model?s predictive power. As proof of principle, we will use this approach to produce precise combinations of human lung progenitor cells that could be used to treat pulmonary diseases such as pulmonary fibrosis, emphysema, or interstitial lung disease. In the near term, our approach will enable us to manipulate pluripotent cells to acquire a precise combination of differentiated cell fates?overcoming a major hurdle in stem cell therapy. In the long term, this approach could be used more generally to control the fate of other cell types including bacteria or cancer cells, and may help to design improved drug delivery protocols."
"9380956","Project Summary Vibrio vulnificus is a natural inhabitant of coastal waters, including the US Gulf. The bacterium causes severe life threatening infections after consumption of contaminated seafood (especially raw oysters) and from wounds contaminated by seawater. Among food-borne pathogens, V. vulnificus is most notable for its high rates of hospitalization and death and its negative economic impact. Indeed, V. vulnificus accounts for 72% of deaths from Vibrio illnesses despite causing only 13% of infections. Although infections are rare, the number of serious infections has been increasing globaly due to climate change that has caused a rise in the number of days amenable to growth of V. vulnificus in coastal waters and the geographical area amenable to the pathogen. Attempts by various agency to warn and protect citezens by implementation of new policies or issuing warnings have met with resistance for it effect on the shellfish harvesting industry and the tourist economy. Thus, the study of V. vulnificus pathogenesis has become both a food safety and public policy priority. A significant virulence factor of V. vulnificus is the large Multifunctional-Autoprocessing RTX toxin (MARTXVv). This toxin is comprised of long repeat regions that are associated with cellular necrosis, but this activity is not sufficient for virulence. Rather, virulence is associated with ?effector domains? that are translocated across host plasma membrane by repeat regions, and then released to the cell cytosol by inositol hexakisphophate induced autoprocessing. Bioinformatics studies reveal that different clinical isolates of V. vulnificus express distinct forms of the toxin, with five different variants assembled from eight different MARTX effector domains. To date, the mechanism of action of five of these domains has been determined. In this project, we will investigate the mechanism of action of the remaining effector domains found in clinical isolates. Further, we will study the relative toxicity of different variants of MARTXVv toxin in pathogenesis by the food- borne route of infection."
"9380967","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Wrist-worn Sensors for Tele-Rehabilitation of the Hemiparetic Upper-Extremity: Stroke and other causes of central nervous system damage can result in debilitating loss of motor control that is often more pronounced in one limb than the other. Using or attempting to use the affected limb during activities of daily living, despite considerable difficulty, stimulates neuroplasticity and motor function recovery. BioSensics, in partnership with the Motion Analysis Laboratory at Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital, will develop wrist-worn sensors for motor retraining after stroke. Our simple technology will encourage affected limb use during the performance of activities of daily living, will remind patients to perform daily prescribed motor control exercises in the home environment, and will assess the quality of limb movement during these exercises. We hypothesize that adding long-term monitoring and biofeedback using wrist-worn sensors to traditional therapies will improve motor ability following stroke; particularly in cases where a high dosage of physical and occupational therapy is not feasible due to insurance coverage, lack of transportation, geography, or other limiting factors. The proposed device is the only telehealth system designed to encourage usage of the affected limb during activities of daily living. Many technologies exist to remotely monitor movement using wearable sensors, but none address the specific needs of patients with hemiparesis. Therefore, there is a significant opportunity to develop a first-to-market technology in this space. The team we have assembled for this collaborative project includes engineers, clinicians, and scientists from BioSensics (a privately held biomedical technology development company) and Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital (the largest provider of rehabilitation medicine in New England). During Phase I of this Fast-Track SBIR project we will develop the wrist-worn sensors and test algorithms for assessing the quality and quantity of upper-limb movement in the home environment based on acceleration measured by these sensors. During Phase II we will develop the telehealth infrastructure for the proposed system, including a home base station that receives daily movement summaries from the wrist-worn sensors and uploads the data via WiFi or LAN to a HIPAA compliant server, and a website that clinicians can use to visualize data and remotely set patient specific exercise regimens and activity goals. We will also conduct a usability study and a clinical study at Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital. The clinical study will compare rehabilitation outcomes between 30 patients with upper-extremity hemiparesis following stroke who receive standard care and supplemental home-based therapy and 30 patients who receive the same intervention but use the proposed system. There is a significant commercialization potential for the proposed technology due to 1) the size of the market, 2) the disruptive nature of our first-to-market technology, and 3) the ongoing national push for a transition from the current fee- for-service healthcare model to accountable-care-organization standards. We will have a market-ready device by the completion of Phase II with plans for a market launch during Phase III, pending FDA approval."
"9396618","Project Summary Protein aggregation is centrally implicated in the pathogenesis of most late-onset neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer?s disease. Aggregating proteins disrupt intracellular functions and can spread outside of neurons to compromise neighboring cells. Internal anti-aggregation controls available to neurons for maintaining proteostasis include chaperone activity, autophagy/lysosomal degradation, and proteasome- mediated degradation. My project is distinct in focusing on a mechanism for external aggregate elimination. We discovered, and have begun to characterize, a previously unknown capacity of C. elegans adult neurons to extrude large (~5M) vesicles that include deleterious cell contents. We call these extruded vesicles exophers. Introduction of proteostasis challenges via inhibiting chaperone expression, autophagy, or the proteasome, or by over-expressing aggregating proteins like human Alzheimer's disease A?1-42, expanded polyglutamine Q128 protein, or high concentration mCherry, increases exopher production from the affected neurons. Aggregated protein can be preferentially segregated into exophers over soluble protein, which remains behind in the neuronal soma. Neurons that make exophers reflect less functional damage from proteotoxic transgene products as compared to those that do not, revealing an apparently neuroprotective activity of exopher-genesis. Some exopher contents can later turn up in remote cells, confirming extrusion. Our initial studies suggest that the early stages of exopher-genesis have mechanistic similarities to the formation of mammalian aggresomes. My project will extend preliminary work that identified cytoskeletal genes required to form exophers. I will: 1) test genetic and mechanistic similarities to aggresome formation; 2) use genetic and cell biological approaches to define the pathway by which microtubules, dynein motors, actin and intermediate filaments mediate the dynamic collection and elimination of aggregating proteins as exophers. My project will identify new genes required for producing exophers, and probe molecular and cellular mechanisms by which several exopher-genesis suppressors contribute to the process of exopher formation. I will also determine whether exopher formation initiates with via a mechanism similar to mammalian aggresome formation and better reveal how cells sort toxic contents. We postulate that exopher-genesis occurs by a mechanism that is conserved from C. elegans to humans. Since we must understand all proteostasis strategies in order to identify targets for neurodegenerative disease, my work on a novel neuroprotective mechanism is likely to have high health relevance and importance in the field."
"9457687","Project Summary Pathogenic bacteria need to acquire essential nutrients to establish and sustain an infection in their hosts. The host restricts access to such nutrients, a concept termed nutritional immunity. As such, bacterial nutrient import systems, and the metabolic regulators that govern them, represent next- generation targets for novel antimicrobials. The Gram-positive bacterium B. anthracis is the causative agent of anthrax disease and a weapon of bioterrorism. This pathogen has a remarkable ability to replicate in vertebrates, a virtue that is useful for the study of how bacteria overcome nutritional immunity. It is well known that the penultimate step in the biosynthesis of branched amino acids, which are necessary for all life, requires an enzyme whose activity is dependent on an iron-sulfur cluster. Our published work and preliminary data suggests that B. anthracis and related species employ a clever metabolic mechanism to govern the balance between the intake of branched amino acids and the maintenance of iron homeostasis in complex host environments. Working under the premise that bacillus is auxotrophic for valine when external iron levels are low, and thus cannot make branched amino acids, we hypothesize that host valine liberated from blood proteins stimulates iron acquisition via the global regulator of virulence in Gram-positive bacteria, CodY. This in turn promotes the import of iron, thereby relieving the auxotrophy and fueling rapid replication in host blood and tissues. In Aim 1 of this project, we report the discovery of a novel branched amino acid transporter and characterize its role in the CodY-dependent stimulation of heme-iron acquisition. In Aim 2, we investigate the mechanism of iron release from heme via two newly uncovered heme-binding enzymes in bacillus. Finally, in Aim 3, we integrate key aspects of the central model to determine the importance of these systems in every step of a developing bacillus infection during anthrax disease. Since this network of nutrient uptake systems and regulators also have homologs in several clinically significant species, the work here will provide fundamental knowledge of how pathogenic bacteria fuel their metabolism during virulence."
"9388303","Seminal studies in mouse models and emerging data in NHP and patient populations have consistently implicated memory T cells as being a formidable barrier to long-term, rejection-free allograft survival, particularly in the setting of costimulation blockade. As such, work in our laboratory over the past several years has focused on identifying new pathways that control memory T cell responses during transplantation. Fc?RIIB, the only inhibitory Fc receptor, inhibits intracellular signaling via the ITIM motif located in its cytoplasmic region. Fc?RIIB is known to be expressed by many immune cell types, including B cells, DCs, macrophages and granulocytes; however, the general consensus for the past few decades has been that T cells do not express this molecule. Work done in the last cycle of the grant published by our lab indicated that Fc?RIIB-/- mice exhibit increased costimulation blockade-resistant rejection relative to WT controls. This increased rejection was not the result of increased antibody secretion, as no differences in anti-donor antibodies were detected in these animals. Instead, we discovered that Fc?RIIB is expressed on a subset of memory CD8+ T cells generated via both transplantation and virally-elicited heterologous immunity, and that blockade of this novel coinhibitory pathway results in enhanced donor-reactive memory CD8+ T cell responses. Our data thus suggest a previously unidentified functional role for Fc?RIIB coinhibitory signaling in regulating CD8+ memory T cells during transplantation. However, the mechanisms underlying this observation, including the identity of the Fc?RIIB ligand in this system (i.e. endogenous antibody vs. Fc-containing biologic), remain unknown. Compellingly, our new preliminary data reveal that the degree of expression of Fc?RIIB on donor- reactive CD8+ memory T cell populations directly correlated with susceptibility of those cells to costimulation blockade, providing further evidence for a T cell-intrinsic role for Fc?RIIB coinhibitory signaling in transplantation. Overall, these data suggest a novel mechanism by which the production of alloantibody may function as a negative feedback loop to prevent alloreactive CD8+ T cell activation, and raise the possibility of an innovative new approach to controlling donor-reactive CD8+ memory T cells during transplantation. Thus, in this proposal we aim to further interrogate the mechanisms by which Fc?RIIB inhibitory signaling regulates donor-reactive memory CD8+ T cell responses in transplantation by determining the T cell intrinsic role of Fc?RIIB signaling, identifying the Fc?RIIB ligand in this system (endogenous antibody/immune complexes vs. Fc-containing biologics), and interrogating the epigenetic and transcription-factor mediated control of Fc?RIIB expression on donor-reactive CD8+ memory T cells during transplantation."
"9409229","Project Summary The drug-resistant form of tuberculosis (TB) has the potential to reduce quality of life and increase the likelihood of mortality. Multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) is treated with at least 6 months of injectable aminoglycoside (AG). Among MDR-TB patients, permanent hearing loss due to the ototoxic effects from long-term use of AGs is profound and may lead to early AG discontinuation. Despite the known risk of AG-induced hearing loss, selections and availability of less ototoxic antibiotics or monitoring of hearing loss are constrained because of limited public health resources in South Africa. It is known that excessive AG concentration, renal impairment, coinfection with HIV with a certain class of antiretroviral therapy (ART), severe systemic inflammation, malnutrition, preexisting hearing loss, and several demographic factors worsen a patient?s potential risk for AG- induced hearing loss during MDR-TB treatment. Among these risk factors, AG concentration needs to receive more attention because ototoxicity is dose-dependent. Maintaining therapeutic AG concentration aids in hearing loss prevention and cure of MDR-TB, but daily blood testing for drug concentration is impractical in South Africa due to financial constraints. Therefore, this proposed study is aiming to estimate the risk of AG-induced hearing loss among MDR-TB infected individuals in South Africa. This study will (1) develop a prediction model of developing AG-induced hearing loss from MDR-TB treatment, and (2) explore the prognostic impact of cumulative AG exposure on AG-induced hearing loss in MDR-TB patients after injectable AG therapy initiation. Cumulative AG exposure will be utilized as a surrogate measure of AG concentration and of the tested time- varying effect of cumulative AG exposure on the risk of AG-induced hearing loss to be introduced into the prediction model. The proposed study is a secondary analysis of an ongoing cluster randomized clinical trial (R01 AI104488) to improve treatment outcomes in individuals with MDR-TB infection in South Africa. All subjects enrolled in the parent study who are self-identified black South African receiving intramuscular kanamycin or amikacin will be included for the proposed study. All key patient details will be abstracted from the parent study including basic demographics with MDR-TB/HIV history and clinical parameters, such as hearing, ART, CD4, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), lung cavities, BMI, serum albumin, as well as MDR-TB regimen including dosing and frequency. Finally, the developed prediction model will assist decision makers in prioritizing vulnerability to hearing loss and providing less ototoxic drugs for prevention of hearing loss within limited resources. The findings will contribute to reducing AG-induced hearing loss by developing a prediction model and filling the gaps in personalized interventions to prevent hearing disability in underserved populations."
"9360008","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Novel Brain Signal Feedback Paradigm to Enhance Motor Learning After Stroke Problem. Stroke damages brain neural structures that control coordinated upper limb movement, causing dysfunction and compromised quality of life. Existing and emerging treatment methods, which are only peripherally-targeted to limbs or directed only at the brain, show limited efficacy in upper extremity (UE) functional recovery in many survivors. Thus, there is a critical need for an innovative, transformative strategy to restore normal coordinated UE movement and functional task performance. Purpose. We will engage the remaining neuronal tissue and pathways in stroke survivors through a precise brain neural feedback system. First, real time functional magnetic resonance imaging (rtfMRI) will provide feedback regarding the specific brain region(s) that the stroke survivor should up-regulate. Second, in sequence, we will then employ real time functional near-infrared spectroscopy (rtfNIRS) to provide the more repetitive practice of an array of movements (not possible in the MR scanner) required to induce the brain plasticity that can drive recovery of more normal UE coordination. Third, to engage Hebbian principles of learning, we will use our fNIRS-triggered functional electrical stimulation (FES), producing affective signals from joint and muscle sensory receptors to the brain motor control system. Fourth, we will subsequently provide a series of motor learning sessions (without brain neural feedback) in order to provide the means for the learner to consolidate and generalize the coordination training to more normal functional task performance. Aim I. Test the innovative coordination training protocol of combination rtfMRI/rtfNIRS brain neural feedback and peripherally-directed, neurally-triggered FES-assisted coordination practice within a framework of motor learning principles. The aim focuses on re-training of wrist extension coordination because it is impaired, but essential for grasp preparation and stable maintenance of the hand for functional use. Hypothesis 1. Chronic stroke survivors will show significant improvement in upper limb function in response to the combined rtfMRI/rtfNIRS brain neural feedback and peripherally-directed, neurally-triggered FES-assisted coordination practice within a framework of motor learning principles. (Primary measure: Arm Motor Abilities Test; AMAT; secondary measures include: AMAT Wrist/Hand subscale; Fugl-Meyer upper limb coordination; and quality of life (Craig Handicap Assessment Rating Tool)). Secondary Aim II. Measure changes in brain activation patterns in response to proposed treatment. We will measure baseline and treatment response according to brain activation volume, intensity, centroid location, and white matter integrity. Objective. During wrist extension, we will measure baseline and treatment response according to brain activation volume, intensity, centroid location, and white matter integrity. Significance. The proposed intervention is a new direction for the PI's laboratory and may be paradigm- shifting in its concept and potential restoration of motor function after stroke."
"9394832","Place value concepts and multi-digit numbers are the foundations of mathematics; however, many  children struggle at acquiring this knowledge. Poor understanding of the place value concepts has  been linked to difficulties in mathematics learning through the elementary and middle school  grades, and it is present not only for children with learning disabilities but also for a large  proportion of normally developing children. It is, thus, important to understand the developmental  mechanisms of multi-digit number learning and potential sources of early experiences that allow  some children to readily grasp the concepts while others continue to struggle. Recent research on place value concepts has suggested that children have partial knowledge of  multi-digit numbers at the preschool period, before receiving formal training from schools. These  precursors of multi-digit number knowledge can serve as important stepping-stones for children to  master the concept of place value once entering schools. However, there are at least two gaps in  our current understanding of the development  of place value concepts. First, how does early  understanding of multi-digit numbers relate to formal school training of the place value concepts?  Second, how do children come to acquire partial knowledge of multi-digit numbers at such a young  age in the first place? The goal of the proposed research aims at filling these gaps in the  literature with three specific aims. Aim 1 tests the hypothesis that early knowledge of multi-digit  numbers is predictive of later school learning of the place value concepts. I propose to conduct a  3-year longitudinal study to measure children?s early understanding of multi-digit numbers at the  start and end of kindergarten, 1st  and 2nd grades. The study will test how early knowledge of  number names and written numerals, as well as other individual difference measurements (e.g., age,  gender, SES, number sense, home exposures to numbers),  relate to the learning of base-10  principles in grade school. Aim 2 tests the hypothesis that acquiring early knowledge of  multi-digit numbers is a form of statistical learning, during which children extract latent  structures that govern the mapping between number words and written numerals through sparse  co-occurrence data. A training study is designed to give children casual experiences with  multi-digit numbers in engaging and child- friendly activities (e.g., picture-book reading, ipad  games). The same children in the statistical learning training will also be given formal school  training afterward, allowing us to assess and provide causal evidence for the hypothesis that early  knowledge prepares children for formal school training of the place value concepts. The knowledge  gained from this research will have implications for: a) determining the role of early knowledge of  multi-digit numbers in preparing children to learn about base-10 notation at schools; b) linking  statistical learning from sparse co-occurrence data about number words and multi-digit numbers to  early partial knowledge of place value; c) documenting how differences in early learning  environment (or input) may contribute to developmental inequalities in later school performances."
"9539852","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         This Pilot project is to explore the issue of using assisted cooling of the socket to improve socket comfort. Celsia NanoSpreader Vapor Cooler technology is a novel passive planar cooling technology developed for cooling microprocessors that we believe can be applied to the problem of socket cooling.  A leading cause of prosthesis abandonment are comfort issues one of which is they are frequently too hot - particularly at Shoulder disarticulation or forequarter level where the socket covers a large portion of the remaining torso. Additionally, the variable intensity sweating inside of the prosthesis socket produces changes in the signals that surface EMG electrodes detect. Active cooling may offer a solution to this problem. The goal of this project is to provide a lightweight, low cost, passive energy method to move the excess heat from the surface of the skin to the outside of the prosthesis.  Celsia is a novel planar cooling technology developed for cooling microprocessors that we think can be applied to the problem of socket cooling. This Pilot project is to explore the issue of using assisted cooling of the sockt to improve socket comfort. The Celsia technology is attractive because it is a completely passive device - no external electrical power is necessary to drive the thermal pumping action which is used to disperse waste heat.  In the first year we are proposing to fabricate bypass sockets so that intact individuals may wear a socket similar to that worn by person with shoulder disarticulation amputations. These sockets will be are either solid (no NanoSpreader), have simple hole cutouts for air cooling, or have the NanoSpreader built in. Using these large surface area sockets we will work out the kinks associated with the use of the Nanospreader and any issues involved with integrating them into a prosthetic socket. In the second year we will recruit persons with lower-limb amputations and have them test similar sockets fabricated for the lower-limb.  We will have the subjects walk on a level treadmill while wearing these sockets and walking at three different speeds while monitoring the temperature inside the socket and measuring O2 consumption. At the end of each subjects session there should be 4 temperature data sets for No socket, solid socket, socket with cutouts, socket with NanoSpreader."
"9378082","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Diminished ability of thymus to produce naive T cells with progressive aging remains a fundamental and  puzzling  phenomenon  for  immunology  and  to-date,  an  intractable  clinical  condition  that  contributes  to  immune  dysfunction  in elderly.  With  advancing  age,  the  thymus  undergoes  striking  fibrotic  and  fatty  changes that culminate in its transformation into adipose tissue. The lineage of ectopic adipocytes and  the  mechanism  of  development  of  thymic  adipocytes  during  aging  are  not  well  understood.  Using  lineage-tracing,  our  research  team  has  shown  that  FoxN1+  thymic  epithelial  cells  (TECs),  that  are  necessary  for  T  cell  development,  can  transition  and  give  rise  to  thymic  adipogenic  precursors.  Consistent  with  this  new  paradigm,  our  lates  preliminary  data  provide  further  in  vivo  evidence  that  proadipogenic  cells  in  aging  thymus  can  originate  from  epithelial  and  endothelial  lineages  via  a  secondary mesenchymal precursor. Based on our novel findings, the central hypothesis of this proposal is that the transition of TECs and endothelial cells contribute towards the lineage of thymic adipocytes and leads to age-related thymic involution.  The  corollary  is  that  blocking  the  fibrogenesis  and  pro- adipogenic  signaling  in  TEC  and  endothelial  lineage  cells  will  protect  against  aging  of  thymus.  Experiments  in  Aim  1  will  test  the  hypothesis  1  that with  advancing  age  transition  of  FoxN1+  cells  into  adipogenic precursors via epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process gives rise to ectopic thymic  adipocytes and compromises the thymic stromal microenvironment. Aim 2 will test the hypothesis 2 that  that  endothelial-lineage  cells  serve  as  adipogenic  progenitors  and  will  reveal  that  blocking  he  ectopic  adipocyte development in thymic perivascular space protect against thymic aging. The Aim 3 will test the hypothesis 3 that age-related fibrogenesis in thymus causes reduction in thymopoiesis and reveal that mechanisms that commit secondary mesenchymal cells into adipocytes participate in thymic dysfunction.   The long-term goal of this research project is to understand the mechanisms that cause thymic adiposity and to develop new approaches to prevent or reverse the process of age-related thymic involution."
"9460829","Project Summary Chromosome Conformation Capture (3C)-based technologies for detecting long-range DNA interactions have matured recently. Hi-C and its variants are currently the state-of the art for genome-wide mapping of long-range interactions. Although there is a fast growing literature on Hi-C data analysis methods, repeat sequences, which can make up a significant proportion of Hi-C reads, are excluded from these analyses. Discarding repetitive genomic content can result in the erroneous assignment of a regulatory element in a mapped region to a target that is not the bona fide target. Moreover, the regulatory elements residing in repetitive regions can control targets in mapped regions. To address these challenges, we will develop biologically motivated, statistically rigorous approaches for allocating multi-mapping reads in Hi-C data analysis. The aims will be accomplished through a combination of methodological development, data-driven simulation, computational analysis, and experimental validation. Statistical resources generated from this project will be disseminated as open-source software. Collectively, these aims will significantly enhance the utility of Hi-C data for profiling long-range interactions of repetitive DNA."
"9378713","The main focus of our research is to investigate the mechanism of development and progression of diabetic nephropathy (DN). Diabetes is prevalent in the people aged 20 years and older. The demographic of veterans population falls in this age group. In the US, diabetes represents the 6th leading cause of death; however, diabetes as a cause of death is underreported. Nearly 50% of the patients with diabetes develop nephropathy. A recent study demonstrated that diabetic patients with kidney disease had 87% higher risk of cardiovascular mortality when compared with those without kidney disease. The early pathologic changes in DN involve renal especially glomerular hypertrophy and expansion of matrix proteins such as collagen, fibronectin and laminin. My laboratory studies the signal transduction mechanisms that lead to the progression of DN. To test our concepts, we use both renal cells (glomerular mesangial and proximal tubular epithelial cells) in culture and mouse and rat models of diabetes. Since many pathologic effects of hyperglycemia are mediated by transforming growth factor-? (TGF?), we investigate the signaling mechanisms of this cytokine in mesangial and proximal tubular epithelial cells. We discovered that the expression of tumor suppressor protein PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted in chromosome 10) is reduced in the diabetic kidney and in renal cells cultured in the presence of high glucose or TGF?. In recent years, we have extensively investigated the mechanism of PTEN downregulation in renal cells and in kidneys of diabetic rodents. The results showed the involvement of TGF? in high glucose-induced suppression of PTEN levels in renal cells. Our results for the first time demonstrated the role of microRNA (miR)-21, miR-26 and miR-214 in the inhibition of PTEN expression in the diabetic milieu. These studies opened the door to the novel application of anti-microRNA therapy for DN. More recently, we extended these studies to include the role of mTOR (mechanistic target of rapamycin) complexes 1 and 2 in diabetic kidney disease. We provided the first evidence for the requirement of inactivation of the exclusive PRAS40 subunit of mTOR complex 1 for glomerular mesangial cell hypertrophy, a pathologic feature of DN. Together with other VA investigators, we showed that rapamycin ameliorated the renal pathologies in diabetic mice. However, rapamycin-mediated complete inhibition of mTOR activity may cause deleterious clinical outcome. In fact, loss of mTORC1 in proximal tubular epithelial cells of mice induces progressive fibrosis. Therefore, more recently we have focused on a novel protein, called deptor, which is a component of both mTOR complexes 1 and 2. In fact, deptor is an endogenous inhibitor of mTOR activity. For the first time, we showed that the renal expression of deptor was significantly reduced in humans with diabetes and in diabetic rodents and that this reduction contributed to the increased mTOR activity. In cultured mesangial and proximal tubular epithelial cells incubated with high glucose, the expression of deptor was significantly reduced, which resulted in sustained activation of both mTORC1 and mTORC2. Thus, it is important to study the mechanisms of deptor downregulation by hyperglycemia. We are currently investigating the epigenetic, post-transcriptional and post-translational mechanisms of deptor reduction in diabetic kidney disease. Furthermore, recent studies have demonstrated a strong correlation between diabetes and renal cell carcinoma (RCC). Also, the incidence of RCC increases after 30 years of age and peaks at the 6th decades, which fall in the demographic of veterans population. We showed that downregulation of PTEN by increased expression of specific microRNAs contributes to the proliferation and invasion of renal carcinoma cells.  Thus, the goal of our studies is to investigate the molecular mechanisms of the progression of diabetic nephropathy and RCC, and identify signaling molecules that can be targeted by small molecular drugs and anti-microRNA based therapies."
"9378085","?    DESCRIPTION:  Bacterial Infections are an important and emerging global healthcare issue. ?-Lactam antibiotics, one of the most important developments in modern medicine, have saved millions of lives and continue to serve as the major therapy to treat bacterial infections. The highly reactive four- membered ?-lactam ring is the key structure for dictating efficacy of this class of antibiotics. Unfortunately, bacteria are rapidly developing resistance to one or more of the most frequently used antibiotics. ?-Lactamase production and excretion is a major defense mechanism employed by several drug-resistant bacterial pathogens. For example, nearly 30% of hospital- acquired infections are identified as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) strains that are resistant to penicillin, methicillin and many other ?-lactam antibiotics, leading to serious infection problems for patients. Currently, vancomycin and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid are among the most commonly used antibiotics for the treatment of Gram-positive bacterial infections. Although these antibiotics are among the strongest of their classes, the high frequency use has resulted in their decreased susceptibility. Efficient antibiotics and/or antimicrobial agents are in high demand, but have limited success in fighting bacterial resistance. We discover a class of charged metallopolymers that exhibits synergistic effects against multidrug resistant bacteria by effectively lysing bacterial cells and efficiently disarming activity of ?-lactamases. Various conventional ?-lactam antibiotics, including penicillin-G, amoxicillin, ampicillin and cefazolin, are protected from ?-lactamase hydrolysis via the formation of unique ion-pairs between their carboxylate anions and cationic metallopolymers. There are at least three innovations involved in this project: (1) our approaches effectively prevent bacterial resistance by protecting and reinstating antibiotics; (2) more importantly our metallopolymer platforms eliminate the possibility of recurrence of bacterial resistance via disarming ?- lactamases and disrupting cell membranes; (3) these metallopolymers are non- or minimally cytotoxic for mammalian cells. Our research and discoveries could provide a new pathway to designing macromolecular scaffolds to regenerate vitality of conventional antibiotics to kill multidrug resistant bacteria and superbugs."
"9379459","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Arsenic and its arsenical derivatives are estimated to effect greater than 200 million people worldwide. Exposure to arsenicals comes from a number of sources such as contaminated drinking water, soil or as an airborne pollutant. Various epidemiological studies have linked chronic arsenic exposure to a number of disease states including cancer of the lungs, bladder, or skin; metabolic diseases such as diabetes; cardiovascular and other vascular diseases; and skin problems such as 'black foot disease'. In addition to the epidemiological studies there has been a great deal of effort to understand the mechanisms of pathology, but to date many questions along these lines remain obfuscated. Part of the problem with understanding arsenic toxicity is the sheer number of cellular systems that arsenic alters. For instance arsenic leads to oxidative stress, compromise of protein quality control, heat-shock response, and cell-cycle alterations to name a few. Work from our lab has identified a crucial link in the effects of arsenic on cells. Chronic treatment with low levels of arsenite (one of the oxides of arsenic) leads to a compromise of autophagy, a major protein quality control pathway. This breach comes at the step of autophagosome/lysosome fusion, leading to a build-up of autophagosomes and high levels of the autophagy specificity factor, p62. Critically, p62 contains a recognition element for Keap1, which is a substrate recognition factor in the Cul3-Keap1-Rbx1 E3 ubiquitin ligase complex. This E3 complex normally maintains a low level of the oxidative stress responsive transcription factor, Nrf2. In the presence of excess p62, Keap1 is occupied, allowing for constitutive, high level expression of Nrf2 and subsequent activation of antioxidant response element regulated genes. This high-level expression confers a growth advantage on the cells and can lead to diseases such as cancer. Despite these mechanistic leaps, it remains the mechanism by which arsenite interferes with autophagy is unknown. In the present research program we propose the hypothesis that arsenicals interfere with the AAA+ protein quality control machine, p97. This provides a critical link between arsenic and autophagy as well as other protein quality control mechanisms. To probe the detailed mechanistic underpinnings of this arsenic-mediated breach we will use an array of detailed mechanistic enzymology studies, coupled with cellular biochemistry, and in vivo studies. These efforts will be greatly aided by the multi-PI team we have assembled."
"9377529","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Quantifying Environmental Variables Affecting Airborne Influenza Transmission In most temperate climates, influenza prevails in cold, dry winter months. However, in some temperate and tropical regions, influenza epidemicity is correlated with extremes of precipitation, not dryness, and can circulate at low levels essentially year-round or appear in uni- or bi-modal annual outbreaks. How environmental variables affect influenza circulation in the human population remains poorly understood, in part because the science behind airborne respiratory virus transmission crosses disciplinary boundaries between the biomedical and physical sciences, encompassing fields as diverse as virology, physiology, epidemiology, fluid mechanics, aerosol science, and climatology. Here we seek to understand how individual environmental variables - such as temperature, humidity, and airflow - cumulatively affect the transmission probability of influenza viruses in a representative mammalian experimental system. The theoretical framework behind these studies is a novel quantitative model, based upon data gathered in experimental guinea pigs, which attempts to characterize the impact of the environment on influenza virus transmission between infected and susceptible hosts. This project bridges the gap between virology and engineering in bringing together three co- investigators with relevant and complementary skill sets: Dr. Nicole Bouvier, a physician-scientist with extensive experience in the transmission of influenza viruses among guinea pigs; Dr. William Ristenpart, an engineer with expertise in the application of high-speed imaging technologies to investigations of complex fluid dynamics; and Dr. Anthony Wexler, an authority on aerosol transport who has developed novel techniques for high-resolution imaging of aerosol deposition in the rodent respiratory tract. Our preliminary theoretical modeling has generated innovative interpretations of the experimental data, yielding three testable hypotheses, which form the basis of this proposal: (1) Influenza virus transmission probability will decrease with increased airflow speed, (2) transmission probability will decrease with the degree of turbulence, and (3) transmission probability will increase with the time integral of the viral concentration within the inoculated animal. Rigorously controlled laboratory studies, designed to isolate a single variable for analysis while others are held constant, will provide a quantitative framework for understanding the cumulative effects of temperature, humidity, airflow velocity, turbulence, and position on the transmission of human influenza viruses in a relevant animal model. Quantifying these environmental variables, individually and cumulatively, will enable their extrapolation to larger environments and time scales, with the potential to transform our understanding of the epidemiology of seasonal and pandemic influenza."
"9377530","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Mature B-lymphocytes undergo class switch recombination (CSR), a deletional-recombination reaction that replaces the constant region of the immunoglobulin (Ig) molecule for one of a set of downstream constant region genes. This changes the class of the expressed antibody from IgM to IgG, IgE or IgA, each of which has distinct effector functions. CSR occurs within and requires large repetitive sequences termed switch (S) regions that precede the constant region genes. CSR is initiated by AID (activation induced deaminase), a single-strand DNA-specific deaminase, that introduces U:G mismatches in transcribed S regions. Subsequent processing by components of base excision repair and mismatch repair pathways introduces DNA double- stranded breaks (DSBs) in S regions. DSBs between two distinct S regions are synapsed and then ligated by end-joining. DSBs serve as obligatory intermediates of CSR; however, DSBs also constitute one of the most toxic lesions that can occur in a cell. A single unrepaired DSB can lead to cell death or can participate in chromosomal translocations, the hallmarks of many types of cancer, including lymphomas. Thus, CSR requires not only the generation but also efficient repair of DSBs. In this proposal we test the hypothesis that phosphorylation of AID plays an essential role in the generation of DSBs. We also explore the hypothesis that the DNA damage sensor ATM participates in inducing AID phosphorylation and repair of DSBs during the process. Impaired CSR leads to impaired ability to respond to pathogens while aberrant CSR is one of the major underlying factors in the ontogeny of B cell lymphomas. Our studies will thus have major impact on both immunodeficiency syndromes and B cell lymphomagenesis."
"9567354","Substance use disorder (SUD), a chronic, relapsing disorder with limited treatment options, costs the US ~$700 billion annually. A few, moderately effective replacement therapies exist for opiate, nicotine and alcohol dependence. However, no such options exist for stimulant dependence and, further, there are no pharmacotherapies to prevent or even reduce relapse associated with any drug class. Associations that have formed during periods of drug use serve as powerful relapse factors by triggering motivation to seek the drug. Recently, the synaptic actin cytoskeleton, a critical regulator of memory, was identified as a biological target for the selective disruption of these associations. Indeed, intra-CNS actin depolymerization produces an immediate and persistent loss of well-established memories associated with the stimulant methamphetamine (METH), without affecting other types of memories. However, ?-actin, the isoform implicated in neuronal plasticity, serves critical functions throughout the body. Therefore, efforts turned to an upstream regulator of the actin cytoskeleton, nonmuscle myosin II (NMII), a more selectively expressed molecular motor that promotes synaptic actin polymerization. All results with direct actin depolymerization have been recapitulated with Blebbistatin, a small molecule inhibitor of NMIIs. Importantly, a single treatment with Blebbistatin is sufficient to produce a seemingly permanent loss of METH-associated memories. In addition to its efficacy in animal relapse models, several properties make Blebbistatin an excellent scaffold for medicinal chemistry. Paramount among these are the molecule?s small size, selectivity for myosin IIs, high brain penetration, and rapid clearance from plasma and brain (short-acting is sufficient and reduces unwanted peripheral and central effects). Unfortunately, Blebbistatin?s activity at cardiac muscle myosin IIs is likely a liability. Optimization efforts have been limited because the therapeutic potentials of NMII inhibition have only been realized in the past few years. Thus, the central goal of this proposal is to develop a safe and selective NMII small molecule inhibitor with improved potency and solubility, that retains its existing, advantageous DMPK properties with minimized toxicological parameters. To accomplish the overall goal of developing an IND ready compound, an extensive pharmaceutical approach to drug discovery and development centered on Blebbistatin analogs will be employed, centered on a detailed structure activity relationship approach. A team has been assembled with many years of preclinical drug development experience that encompasses all of the methodologies employed in this project (medicinal chemistry, biochemistry, cell biology, neurobiology, in vivo pharmacology, drug metabolism and pharmacokinetics (DMPK), toxicology, and clinical research), making this team uniquely qualified to direct the program. By capitalizing on the unique therapeutic discovery and development capabilities at Scripps Florida, this proposal is expected to yield a safe, efficacious compound with sufficient preclinical safety data to support human clinical trials focused on SUD relapse."
"9388311","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The Zika epidemic that began in Brazil and has spread to Central America and US territories, caused by the Asian Zika virus (ZIKV) strain, has been reported by the CDC as definitively linked to severe birth defects ? microcephaly, miscarriage and stillbirth. Detection of ZIKV RNA in the placenta and fetus and in maternal circulation for months, calcifications associated with long-standing infection, and intrauterine growth restriction indicate that virus-induced pathology impairs placental functions. To address the issue of transplacental ZIKV transmission, we propose a collaborative project between Dr. Lenore Pereira (UCSF) and Dr. Eva Harris (UC Berkeley), experienced investigators with complementary expertise in congenital infection of the human placenta and Flavivirus research, respectively. Our preliminary studies reveal that prototype and recently iso- lated Nicaraguan ZIKV strains infect cells in placental explants and primary cells isolated from human placenta that express AXL, Tyro3 and TIM1 tyrosine kinase receptors, which mediate ZIKV and the closely related dengue virus (DENV) infection in skin. Infected placental cells, including fetal amniotic epithelial cells, placental fibroblasts and trophoblast progenitor cells, developed cytopathology and expressed ZIKV envelope and non- structural NS3 proteins, and virus titers released depended on the receptors expressed and gestational age. Indicative of infection route, AXL was detected in decidua (uterine decidual cells and invasive cytotrophoblasts), chorionic villi (placental fibroblasts, Hofbauer cells and blood vessels) and fetal membranes (amniotic epithelial cells and trophoblast progenitor cells). Differential expression of receptors suggests how ZIKV could infect the decidua and spread to the placenta, fetus and amnion-chorion membranes. Further, in endemic regions, cross- reactive pre-existing antibodies to DENV could play a critical role in protection or pathogenesis of ZIKV in placenta tissues during pregnancy. Our overarching hypothesis is that placental primary cells and explants of decidua, chorionic villi and amnion-chorion membranes can be used as a model of the human placenta to define molecular mechanisms of ZIKV infection by free virions; the role of antibodies in neutralization, trans- cytosis, and enhancement of ZIKV infection in the placenta; and the translational impact of inhibitors and thera- peutic neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (MAbs). Our Specific Aims are: Aim 1. Identify cells at the uterine- placental interface that are susceptible to infection by Nicaraguan ZIKV strains in primary cells and placental explants, characterize cognate receptors, and identify small-molecule inhibitors of infection. Aim 2. Study the neutralizing and potentially enhancing role of ZIKV-specific and DENV-cross-reactive antibodies on infection and transcytosis in primary placental cells and explants and determine the therapeutic potential of neutralizing MAbs with modified Fc that preclude antibody-dependent enhancement. The proposed studies will reveal molecular mechanisms of ZIKV infection, routes of virus transmission to the fetus, and therapeutic potential for engineered antibodies and small molecule inhibitors that block infection and prevent congenital disease."
"9379448","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Herpesviruses are endemic within the human population, and cause a wide range of life-threatening diseases. Members of the beta-herpesvirus (?-HV) and gamma-herpesvirus (?-HV) subfamilies are extremely problematic in immunocompromised individuals, leading to severe congenital disorders and a variety of cancers. During the herpesviral replication cycle, viral genes are expressed temporally in an ordered cascade, with timing linked to appropriate life cycle stage needs. Following viral genome replication, a group of viral genes termed late genes (L) are robustly activated and produce proteins necessary for progeny virion assembly and egress. Mechanisms governing L gene expression in the ?-HV and the ?-HV largely remain a mystery. However, shedding light on this aspect of herpesviral biology has become a high priority, in part due to recent discoveries demonstrating that mutants impaired in this final viral transcription cascade cannot produce progeny virions. An understanding of the regulatory features critical for L gene transcription may therefore reveal robust new targets for antiviral strategies. Our data demonstrate that late gene transcriptional regulation is unique, as it incorporates both molecular mimicry and selective recruitment of key host transcriptional machinery in a manner not previously observed in viral or host gene expression. Thus, the focus of this grant is to define the composition and regulation of this novel gene expression complex, as well as reveal how it may globally impact gene expression in infected cells."
"9378421","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): High indoor allergen and pollutant levels have repeatedly been linked to asthma morbidity, especially among urban children, who have among the highest asthma morbidity in the US. However, environmental intervention trials for asthma have typically compared an environmental control strategy (ECS) to no intervention, a design that does not reflect the recommended approach to asthma management, which includes ECSs in conjunction with titration of controller medication. As a result, it remains unknown whether the addition of an ECS to controller medication titration results in improved asthma control, and therefore a reduced controller medication requirement. Another unanswered question is whether the addition of an ECS to controller medication titration results in greater reduction of allergic inflammation than medication titration alone. ECSs may have a greater effect on allergic inflammation than controller medications because ECSs target the most upstream point of the asthma inflammatory pathway by reducing pro-inflammatory environmental exposures, while controller medications target a downstream point of this pathway. Surprisingly, it is also unknown whether the improvement in asthma in ECS trials is mediated by reductions in allergen levels and/or reduction in pollutant levels. Understanding the factors that mediate the effects of an ECS on asthma is important for refuting, or supporting, a causal role for indoor allergens and/or pollutants in asthma morbidity, and also for optimizing the design of ECSs to target the most influential factors. We therefore hypothesize that the addition of an individually-tailored, multi-faceted ECS to guidelines-based controller medication titration will result in less controlle medication requirement and allergic inflammation than controller medication titration alone among urban asthmatic children. We will test this hypothesis and identify the factors that mediate the clinical effects of the ECS with a parallel-arm, randomized controlled trial of ECS plus controller medication titration vs. controller medication titration alone. Our aims are: (1) T determine the effect of the addition of ECS to controller medication titration on controller medication requirements and allergic inflammatory biomarkers, and (2) To determine whether reductions in particulate matter (PM) and/or indoor allergens mediate the effects of an ECS on asthma. This proposed trial will answer a pivotal question because if ECSs do not provide additional benefit in the context of treatment with controller medication, the role of ECS in asthma management should be downgraded. On the other hand, if ECSs do indeed reduce controller medication requirements, greater emphasis should be placed on the importance of ECSs in asthma management, studies should be conducted to identify best ECS practices, and policies should be changed to require third party payers to cover ECS costs."

"9378416","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Interferons (IFNs) are critical mediators of host defense, and although they are used clinically to treat a number of diseases, their precise mechanisms of action remain to be completely understood. IFNs induce the transcription of a subset of genes called IFN stimulated genes (ISGs) that are responsible for complex biological effects. Only by understanding the function of individual ISGs will the molecular basis of IFN antiviral activity be realized. Expression of one ISG, ISG54/IFIT2, promotes apoptosis, and the broad objectives of this proposal are to determine the protective role of ISG54 in innate immunity and in viral latency. Mice have been generated with a targeted deletion in the ISG54 gene, and these mice have increased susceptibility to latency establishment by murine ?-herpesvirus 68.  Host defense mechanisms are uniquely challenged by herpesviruses which evade innate and adaptive immune controls to establish chronic, life-long infections. There is a need to elucidate the dynamic interface between virus and host in order to harness the action of host defense mechanisms in the development of novel therapeutics. The ?-herpesviruses, Epstein Barr virus and Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus, are associated with morbidity and mortality worldwide resulting from lymphoproliferative disease, lymphoma, carcinoma, and sarcoma, especially in immunosuppressed individuals. Therapeutic intervention of latent infections is medically challenging. Since these viruses are species-specific, methods to study immune control are limited. The closely related murine ?-herpesvirus 68 provides a vital, small animal model system to dissect virus-host interactions that determine the pathogenic outcome in a natural host. The specific aims of the proposal are designed to evaluate the protective role of ISG54 both in an animal model of infection and in tissue culture systems, and to discover the molecular mechanisms of ISG54 that trigger apoptosis. Specific Aim 1: Establish the role of ISG54 at the host-pathogen interface. Murine models of disease have been invaluable to understand the role of the innate immune system in controlling pathogens. The ISG54 knockout mouse will be used to determine the mechanisms by which ISG54 regulates latent infection of the MHV-68 model pathogen. Specific Aim 2: Determine the molecular mechanisms of ISG54/IFIT2 action. Expression of ISG54 promotes mitochondrial apoptosis, and it is known that ISG54 exists within the cell in large molecular complexes with other proteins. Studies are designed to provide mechanistic insight to the impact of ISG54 on pro-apoptotic factors and critical binding partners. An in vivo model of disease and in vitro systems will be used to dissect the molecular mechanisms of an IFN-induced host defense gene at the viral interface. Achievement of our objectives is expected to provide knowledge necessary to harness the action of ISG54 and fill the need for new therapeutic development."
"9388952","Summary: Antibiotic resistance represents one of the greatest threats to human health. In particular, the six so-called ESKAPE pathogens (Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumanii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and enterobacteriaceae) represent highly drug-resistant bacteria that exert a tremendous global burden of disease. The potential scope of this crisis was highlighted in a recent report commissioned by the Wellcome Trust and British Government; the authors projected that, by 2050, drug-resistant bacterial infections could cost the global economy a cumulative $100 trillion and kill 10 million people annually. To address this issue, there is a critical need for innovative antibacterial treatments. One compelling therapeutic strategy leverages recombinant enzymes that degrade cell wall peptidoglycan, thereby causing bacterial lysis and death. Currently, all such lytic enzyme therapies are trans-acting in nature, i.e., they are derived from bacteriophage or the immune systems of eukaryotic organisms. This proposal seeks to establish an entirely new paradigm for developing bacteriolytic enzyme drugs. We hypothesize that a pathogen's own endogenous cell wall hydrolases (i.e., ?autolysins?) can be co-opted to yield potent antimicrobial agents that are refractory to new resistance phenotypes. To test this hypothesis, we will pursue initial studies with the high impact pathogen methicillin resistant S. aureus (MRSA), although the strategy should be broadly applicable to any bacterial pathogen. Here, complementary computational and experimental approaches will be utilized to identify, isolate, and engineer potent autolysins derived from staphylococcal proteomes. In aim 1, the sequenced genome of S. aureus and related bacteria will be searched for autolysins using bioinformatics. Candidate enzymes will be cloned, evaluated, and their activities will be improved via computationally guided fusion to high performance cell wall targeting domains. In aim 2, a complementary high throughput screening strategy will be taken to identify autolysins from genomic libraries of pathogenic staphylococci. The activities of candidate enzymes will be improved via combinatorial chimeragenesis with high performance cell wall targeting domains, followed by high throughput functional screening of the resultant chimeric libraries. In aim 3, lead autolysin candidates will be further engineered for potent anti-staphylococcal activity using a directed evolution strategy. The most promising lead candidates from these studies will be rigorously evaluated using a panel of clinically relevant in vitro and in vivo assays. Ultimately, this project could yield both novel anti-staphylococcal agents and an entirely new paradigm for development of antibacterial biotherapies."
"9494409","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Between 2001 and 2010, more than 130,000 active service members received diagnoses of intervertebral disc (IVD) degeneration, with annual incidence rates more than doubling over this period. Over 68,000 days of lost duty time were attributed to disc degeneration-specific diagnoses. Military training and operations are inherently physically demanding, placing military service members at increased risk for IVD degeneration and related neck and back pain. Among Veterans, chronic back pain accounts for over 70 percent of chiropractic visits and in many cases is directly connected to their period of service. Despite the prevalence and soaring costs, there is no specific treatment that restores physiological functions of the diseased IVD.  The objective of this pilot study is to confirm that young allogeneic articular chondrocytes, especially those induced to overexpress growth factors (e.g., bone morphogenetic protein, BMP-7) are effective in repairing the degenerating IVD. Articular chondrocytes would be an appropriate cell source because they already have a phenotype similar to that of the IVD cells, and, unlike native disc cells, have greater potential for clinical translation through allogeneic transplantation. Young chondrocytes will be used here because a body of literature supports the notion that young cells possess more regenerative capacity than older cells by rejuvenating host tissue via trophic factors. Our team has pioneered the development of a rabbit IVD-injury model which is ideally suited to evaluating cell-based therapeutics.  Our preliminary data have shown that young allogeneic articular chondrocytes injected into the center of the injured rabbit IVD survived and reduced inflammation of the host tissue. In the proposed study, hydrogels with distinct properties will be assessed as scaffold that may prevent leakage from the injection needle track and enhance biomechanical properties of the repaired IVD. The injectable implants shown to mimic the native NP in mechanics will be more likely to induce the appropriate phenotype in the cells as the disc is loaded in vivo. Specifically, our group has developed hyaluronic acid (HA)-based hydrogels conducive to preservation of chondrocyte phenotype and growth, which solidify at body temperature and are thus ideal for injection therapies. We have also tested a triple-interpenetrating-network (TIN) hydrogel that enhances biomechanical properties of the repaired IVD. Based on our preliminary studies, we hypothesize that transplanting articular chondrocytes seeded in hydrogels will repopulate the IVD thus reducing inflammation and enhancing biomechanical properties by providing trophic factors and synthesizing extracellular matrix. Two specific aims are proposed, to test this hypothesis. In Aim 1, we will compare the HA and TIN gel in supporting transplanted articular chondrocyte survival and reducing host inflammatory responses in the rabbit IVD-injury model. The hydrogel that best supports cell survival and reduces host inflammation will be further tested. In Aim 2, we will determine the therapeutic effects of young articular chondrocytes on injured mature rabbit IVDs. The effects of chondrocytes (native or overexpressing bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)-7) on the host IVD inflammation, biomechanical properties, and tissue structure will be determined.  We expect that IVDs repaired with chondrocytes seeded in hydrogel will show improved biomechanical properties, decreased inflammation, and improved morphology. These studies in the rabbit will lay the groundwork for clinical studies that will test if transplanted chondrocytes  are effective in reducing disc degeneration and back pain, thus benefiting patients."
"9240882","T-cell leukemias and lymphomas are clinically aggressive cancers resistant to conventional chemotherapy regimens and in desperate need for novel therapeutic approaches. This proposal studies the pathogenesis of these hematologic neoplasms and directly benefits Veterans' health by advancing the development of targeted therapy, and precision medicine for these treatment-resistant cancers. Our laboratory has been studying T-cell neoplasms from the perspective of two major oncogenic pathways: the LIM domain Only-2 (LMO2) pathway and the IL2RG/JAK1/3/STAT5 cytokine signaling pathway. LMO2 is one of the most frequently deregulated oncogenes in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. LMO2 encodes a small 18 kDa protein that is part of a large multisubunit protein complex that regulates the transcription of key target genes. We have been dissecting the mechanism by which LMO2's enforced expression induces T-ALL and have discovered key pre-leukemic phenotypes enforced by LMO2 like differentiation arrest and enhanced self-renewal. The IL2RG/JAK1/3/STAT5 pathway is required for the development and function of lymphocytes and our lab discovered that gain of function in this pathway is common in both mature and immature T-cell neoplasms. In recent exciting data, our LMO2 and JAK3 work has converged in intriguing findings. Mutational and gene expression analyses show that LMO2 overexpression and JAK3 activating mutations are concordant hits in both mature and immature T-cell neoplasms. The results imply that these two pathways cooperate to induce T- cell transformation. Interestingly, enforced expression of LMO2 in double negative T-cell progenitors induces highly penetrant T-cell leukemias but double positive progenitors do not develop leukemia. Similarly, enforced expression of constitutively active mutant JAK3 does not induce disease on its own. We hypothesize that T-cell transformation into leukemia or lymphomas may manifest if these two pathways were concordantly activated. In this proposal, we will investigate the mechanistic basis of this cooperativity so that T-cell leukemias and lymphomas may be better targeted therapeutically. In Aim 1, we will investigate the cooperativity between LMO2 and JAK3 oncogenes using bone marrow transduction and transplantation in our Lmo2 transgenic mouse model. In Aim 2, we will analyze signal transduction within the IL2RG/JAK1/3/STAT5 pathway in leukemias and lymphomas induced in Lmo2 transgenic mice. In Aim 3, we will test the use of JAK inhibitors against primary human T-cell neoplasms and analyze synergy with chemotherapy and LMO2 knockdown. The Aims will establish a foundation for the development of novel biomarkers and novel therapeutic approaches based on LMO2 and IL2RG/JAK1/3/STAT5 pathways."
"9389337","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application seeks funding for the Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities Research Center (IDDRC) at the U of PA (Penn) and the Children's Hosp of Philadelphia (CHOP). Our IDDRC, now in its 25th year, is an inter- disciplinary program that is the chief agency at CHOP/Penn for the promulgation of research into the developmental disabilities. In the next cycle we build upon this foundation by proposing an innovative Center with 6 components: (1) A research project which uses magnetoencephalography (MEG) to develop a novel biomarker - an electronic signature - for non-verbal and minimally verbal children with autistic spectrum disorders; (2) A series of 6 research core facilities which will provide investigators with state-of-the-art facilities and expertise, including 2 new cores (Preclinical Models and Clinical Translational); (3) An educational program which will nurture a feeling of IDD Community by featuring monthly seminars, including the IDDRC Research Lecture, the Monthly Chalk Talks and the Autism Distinguished Lecture Series; (4) A career development initiative which will benefit dozens of exceptional young investigators who will receive support from the IDDRC New Program Development award (to be funded by the Philadelphia Foundation), the IDDRC-administered T32 Training Grant in Neurodevelopmental Disabilities and several private awards (aggregate value ~ $3 million over 5 years) given by local philanthropies to the IDDRC; (5) A research advocacy mission which involves an IDDRC- CHOP/Penn collaboration to create Centers of Excellence that encourage inter-disciplinary translational research into IDD; and (6) Participation in the larger IDDRC Network in order to realize the scientific and organizational goals of the IDD Branch of NICHD. The Center will support 78 federally-funded projects ($23.3 million/yr), of which 15 are from NICHD ($5.8 million/yr). The theme of our IDDRC is Genes, Brain, Behavior, a designation which reflects our ongoing effort to understand IDD in 3 inter-related domains: (a) The genetic anlage which causes a disability or modulates disease severity; (b) The anomalies of brain biochemistry and neurophysiology which accompany genetic changes; and (c) The phenomenological manifestations of these genetic/neurophysiologic alterations which we recognize as clinical manifestations of the IDD. Our rationale for this reductionist approach is that the dissection of  a disability into isolated and simpler components affords a strategy with which to develop therapies that will prevent, attenuate or even reverse the devastating consequences of the disorder. Over the coming 5 years the Center will pursue this aim by deploying these tools: cutting-edge research cores, a focus on translational research, the enormous clinical resources of CHOP/Penn, nurturing a cadre of future leaders, and a strong emphasis on creative partnership with the IDDRC Network."
"9485551","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) pose exciting possibilities for cell-based regenerative therapies. Their capability to differentiate along multipe musculoskeletal lineages makes them attractive as an alternative source of autologous cells. However, these cells must first be separated from other cell types before practical use, which has proven difficult using antibody-based sorting approaches. Typical cell yields are often less than 1%, which necessitates expensive and time-consuming monolayer expansion to obtain sufficient cell numbers for clinical therapies. Alternative enrichment strategies are needed that can identify large numbers of cells by lineage potential. In this project, we will investigate mechanical- and gene expression-based approaches for osteogenic and adipogenic lineage enrichment. To accomplish the overall goals of the project we will: (1) Determine whether live, single-cell mechanical biomarkers indicate the regenerative capacity of stem cells. Atomic force microscopy will be used to quantify the elastic and viscoelastic properties of individual MSCs before, during, and after osteogenic and adipogenic differentiation. These data will provide sorting parameters that allow for separation of cells into tissue-specific groups based on mechanical similarity. The tissue building capacity of sorted cell populations will be compared using established in vitro protocols for osteogenesis and adipogenesis. (2) Develop and implement a live-cell molecular beacon assay that distinguishes differentiating cells from non-differentiating cells based on lineage- specific gene expressions. Beacons, which fluoresce upon binding to target mRNA molecules, will identify osteogenic and adipogenic potential in freshly isolated MSCs from lipoaspirate. Highly expressing cells will be enriched via fluorescence-activated cell sorting and evaluated for their differentiation capabilities. (3) Investigate the combination of mechanical and gene expression biomarkers for enrichment of lineage-specific cells in vitro and in vivo. Preliminary findings suggest that molecular beacons can identify a broad set of cells capable of lineage-specific differentiation while mechanical biomarkers can predict the robustness of the differentiation response. The combination of these two techniques is expected to enrich for highly regenerative, tissue-specific cells. Sorted cell populations will be evaluated for the amount and type of matrix synthesized, first, in monolayer and, ultimately, in an in vivo mouse model. In addition to discovering how mechanical properties are associated with differentiation and lineage potential, this work will generate a set of molecular beacons broadly applicable to musculoskeletal investigations. We expect experimental findings to elucidate aspects of cellular heterogeneity in stem cell populations while also facilitating the practical implementation of cell-based clinical therapies. This work wil be conducted through collaborations between Brown University and Rhode Island Hospital."
"9323832","Project Abstract: South Carolina Department of Agriculture The South Carolina Department of Agriculture (SCDA) is seeking funding support for personnel, travel, training, equipment and supply costs needed to implement a comprehensive and integrated food protection plan that will meet the objectives of the Manufactured Food Regulatory Program Standards (MFRPS). SCDA Consumer Protection Division (CPD) has been involved in the process of MFRPS compliance since 2008. The primary obstacle impeding SCDA in achieving compliance to the Standards has been limitations in staffing levels. To overcome this barrier, this proposal for a Cooperative Agreement includes funding for two additional full time employees (Year One) to be exclusively dedicated to the successful development of a MFRPS program. To reach MFRPS compliance within five years, the SCDA will hire one full time MFRPS Program Coordinator to manage all programmatic activities related to MFRPS, including but not limited to the development of a strategic action plan, improved stakeholder communications, educational outreach to industry, audit assistance and enforcement support, improvement of the Department?s ability to coordinate trace back/trace forward efforts, and outbreak communications with the public. A second full time Administrative Assistant position to support the activities of the MFRPS Program Coordinator will also be added to the current staff through the proposed funding. The person in this position will be expected to execute the efficient tracking of inspections, complaints, audit findings, trainings, outreach activities, and any other related information of this program. Achieving conformance with the MFRPS will enable the SCDA to ensure that national standardized food safety objectives are met and that SCDA has staff and resources to both enforce and advance these objectives."
"9259459","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a rising public health threat now affecting a quarter of the world adult population and a third of the US adult population. The implications of this health condition are significant: those afflicted with MetS are twice as likely to die from and three times as likely to develop coronary heart disease or stroke, compared to those without it. People with MetS are also at a five times greater risk of developing Type 2 diabetes. As a result of its global burden, substantial effort has been made to identify risk factors for both diabetes and MetS in attempts to target prevention and early intervention. Inorganic arsenic exposure has been associated with numerous health outcomes, including cancer, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and MetS. Evidence suggests that methylation of inorganic arsenic to dimethylated arsenic (DMA) facilitates its excretion and detoxification; this is supported by findings that higher %DMA has been associated with lower arsenic-related health effects, particularly cancer and cardiovascular disease. Arsenic metabolism profiles, however, present differently for metabolic-related outcomes, with lower %DMA being associated with diabetes, BMI and MetS, including in prospective studies. One-carbon metabolism (OCM), an essential biochemical cycle dependent on B-vitamins and other nutrients such as choline, appears to play a role in both arsenic metabolism and metabolic outcomes. Little is known, however, on the interplay between OCM and arsenic metabolism for MetS development, especially in US populations. In our proposed research, we aim to fill in these important gaps in research using existing data from the Strong Heart Family Study, a prospective family- based cohort developed to investigate genetic and non-genetic factors for cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and their risk factors in American Indians. First, we plan to evaluate the association of arsenic exposure and arsenic metabolism with incident MetS in this population. Second, we will separately evaluate the associations between intake of OCM vitamins (choline, folate (B9) and vitamins B12, B6, and B2) with arsenic metabolism as well as with incident MetS. We will then assess the influence of OCM in the relationship between arsenic exposure and metabolism with MetS by evaluating the change in the magnitude and significance of the association between arsenic metabolism and MetS after accounting for measures of OCM. Lastly, we will attempt to better characterize mechanistic pathways in the diabetogenic effects of arsenic exposure and metabolism through metabolomic data. Improved understanding of modifiable risk factors for MetS, such as arsenic exposure and nutrient-regulated OCM, are essential to identifying high risk populations and developing early preventative interventions"
"9389354","(CLINICAL TRANSLATIONAL CORE(CTC): CORE B) PROJECT SUMMARY Description: The Clinical Translation Core (CTC) provides investigators with a set of services to enhance the productivity of Intellectual and Developmental Disability (IDD) clinical translational researchers. The CTC focuses on the effective and rapid collection of IDD study populations that are of adequate size and well- characterized. IDDs are highly variable disorders that result from heterogeneous genetic factors which affect brain function in a non-uniform manner. Scientific progress demands that each IDD be well characterized and stratified along more than one dimension in order to control for a degree of clinical heterogeneity that otherwise could confound progress in developing therapies. The CTC addresses this challenge by providing a host of approaches to enable recruitment of very large samples that are well-characterized across relevant dimensions. These supports include (a) Creating new websites for individual projects that will serve as both a recruitment portal and as a mechanism to enable online IRB consent and collection of ?light phenotyping? through use of a common IDD library of questionnaires; (b) Mining the CHOP/Penn electronic health record for recruitment and for study data; (c) Creation of a shared IDD database that is common to all IDDs investigated at our institutions. This shared database will facilitate secondary analyses that discriminate clinical features specific to a particular IDD; and (d) The coordination of the many existing clinical translational resources at CHOP/UPenn, in order to carry out the CTC's aims in the most cost effective manner, and amplify its effectiveness. The CTC also provides expert consultation with (a) gold standard clinician administered assessments, as well as (b) deep phenotyping via a host of novel, technology based approaches for quantifying behavior (e.g., eye tracking, motion capture, use of on online computer adaptive tests). In addition to these crucial supportive roles, the CTC will foster new clinical investigation by creating an infrastructure that will be available to future investigators, which will simplify their entre to high-quality human research. Relevance to IDDRC Mission: Then CTC is of fundamental importance to the mission of the IDDRC as it facilitates interdisciplinary and translational research in IDD. It is a vital component of the CHOP/UPenn Center's goal of advancing the diagnosis, prevention, treatment, and amelioration of IDDs. The CTC helps bridge all three domains of the organizing theme of the CHOP/Penn IDDRC (see Overall: Overview of Center): ?Genes, Brain, and Behavior?. By centrally focusing on quantifying behavior, as well as facilitation of biosample collection, it is integral the process of successfully understanding and treating the biological bases of the behavioral manifestations of IDD. Eligibility: These services are available both to approved users of the IDDRC at CHOP/UPenn and to approved users at other Centers in the Network."
"9471634","Abstract The LAM Foundation Annual Research meeting has been co-sponsored by the NHLBI since 1999. While the hallmark of the this unique meeting has always been the seamless integration of patients into every aspect of the conference, the format has been reinvented year after year by conducting joint conferences with the Rare Lung Disease Consortium and the Tuberous Sclerosis Alliance, moving the venue from Cincinnati to Chicago to Washington DC to Los Angeles, and by introducing thematic agendas. The first of these was the Biomarker Innovation Summit, a unique highly-interactive format that spawned six projects focused on development of tools to guide LAM diagnosis and management. The 2017 LAM Foundation International Lymphangioleiomyo- matosis Research Conference will be the second in this thematic series, focusing on translating the breath- taking scientific advances in lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) of the last decade to Patient Benefit. We view this `translational obligation' as a donor mandate; ensuring that families who have raised hard earned dollars for research reap the benefits of their efforts in time to help their loved ones. The Specific Aims of the LAM Foundation Patient Benefit conference, to be held at the LA Airport Westin November 9-12, 2017, will be four- fold: 1) to facilitate results-driven dialog among scientists, clinicians and patients aimed at identifying both patient needs and viable solutions across several modalities, 2) to identify new therapies or products that offer benefits within five years or less to patients living with LAM, 3) to inspire research and product development proposals that have potential to improve the treatment and/or quality of life for patients living with LAM, and 4) to raise money to fund the most promising research proposals. The conference will be roughly modeled after the LAM Foundation Biomarker Innovation Summit, with short talks alternating with breakout sessions populated by content experts and patients. Topics for the meeting will be largely derived from pre-meeting surveys of clinicians, scientists and patients who treat, study and live with LAM, respectively. Preliminary focus group feedback has indicated that shortness of breath, fatigue, limitation of activities and prognostic uncertainty are prominent issues for LAM patients. The Patient Benefit Steering Committee has invited a core of experts based on these initial responses, but the future invitations will be based on themes that arise from additional polls of patients and investigators. A combined patient/investigator social function, also called Patient Benefit (a variation on the annual Breath of Hope Gala), will take place at the event to raise funds for proposals generated at the meeting. At the conclusion of the meeting, participants will be asked to respond to a Request for Applications, and the most meritorious proposals will receive support from the Foundation. In this way, we hope to promote projects that are capable of yielding Patient Benefit in the short term, such as the use of biomarkers (including VEGF-D) for personalized dosing, use of cyst quantification as a biomarker of progression, and development of a preemptive approach to mental health care for the newly diagnosed."
"9536400","Project Summary Pertrubed affective processing is a defining symptom of a host of psychiatric disorders, such as depression where it is a primary symptom, and disorders where affective disturbances are secondary symptoms, for example, schizophrenia. Studies of healthy individuals and those with depressed mood implicate a network of areas centering on ventral anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and amygdala in the control of long-term changes in affect. Despite this understanding, the neural mechanisms that generate and regulate affective experiences are unclear. One reason for this lack of clarity stems from the fact that studies of affect in animals typically only assess instantaneous and short-lived behavioral and neural responses to discrete aversive or positive stimuli. These stimuli typically last less than a second and generally belonging to a small class (e.g., juice) that are not particularly ecologically relevant. To date, no studies in non-human primates have probed the neural basis of affective states that extend over minutes or hours, durations typical of mood states in humans. Such studies would form the foundation for understanding how mood is controlled at the level of brain circuits and single neurons. The objective of this proposal is to determine how the circuit connecting ventral ACC and amygdala functions before, during, and after the induction of either negative or positive affective states in non-human primates. We hypothesize that negative and positive temporally extended affective states will be associated with unique patterns of local and circuit-level neural activity within ventral ACC and amygdala during affect induction and the selection (or regulation) of affective state. We will test our hypothesis by first determining how local and circuit level activity within ventral ACC and amygdala encodes the valence of dynamic, ecologically relevant stimuli that generate unique affective states (Aim 1). We will record both single neurons and local field potentials in both ventral ACC and amygdala and analyze the timing of the neural responses and LFP coherence among these areas to gain circuit-level understanding. Then, using a translationally- relevant affect induction technique that mirrors affect induction paradigms used in humans, we will establish how affect-related neural activity within the ventral ACC-amygdala circuit is altered when temporally extended changes in affective state, both positive and negative, are induced (Aim 2). The induction of affective state will be confirmed using both behavioral (i.e., response selection) and cardiac correlates of parasympathetic and sympathetic activity, measures of affective state that are well validated in humans. Once the neural mechanisms, the specific patterns of neural activity within the ventral ACC-amygdala circuit that control affective states are known, we anticipate being able to either increase or decrease activity in this circuit to influence affective states. This project marks a significant departure from standard approaches to studying affective non-human primates and has the potential to provide vital knowledge for treating mood disorders."
"9385284","Project Summary Zika virus (ZIKV), a mosquito-borne flavivirus, was originally discovered in Uganda in 1947, and for nearly all of its history has been associated with mild self-limited illness. This changed during recent and ongoing ZIKV outbreaks in the South Pacific and Latin America, which have revealed new modes of transmission (i.e. sexual and in utero), as well as unexpected disease presentations (including birth defects and Guillain-Barr syndrome). These severe manifestations of ZIKV infection all involve the virus invading tissues that ordinarily are protected by anatomic barriers, including the central nervous system, the testes, and the fetal compartment. Understanding the viral and host factors that determine ZIKV tissue tropism is critical for evaluating the pathogenic potential of emerging ZIKV strains in new host environments. In this proposal, we will employ a new ZIKV reverse genetics system to experimentally test the hypothesis that genetic changes in the ZIKV strains currently circulating in Latin America confer enhanced virulence. In particular, we will focus on N-linked glycosylation in the virion envelope protein, as this is well-established as a virulence determinant in other flaviviruses and differs between contemporary outbreak strains of ZIKV and historical ones. Since novel tissue tropism may contribute to new manifestations of ZIKV infection, we will investigate the role of interferon lambda (IFN-?) in maintaining barriers to ZIKV tissue tropism, including the blood-brain barrier, placenta, and sertoli cell barrier, as has been shown previously for West Nile virus neuroinvasion. We will infect mice that lack the IFN-L receptor and compare ZIKV viral loads in the central nervous system, fetal compartment, testes, and eyes to tissues that are not protected by specialized barriers and to wild-type mice. Conversely, we will infect mice that lack the IFN-ab receptor, which develop high viral loads and tissue dissemination, with recombinant IFN-L protein and determine whether this results in barrier tightening and restriction of ZIKV invasion. As IFN-L protein has been used successfully in phase II clinical trials as a therapy for hepatitis C virus infection, this approach would provide a potential method to treat severe ZIKV infection. Altogether, our studies will reveal key viral and host determinants of ZIKV tissue tropism, key aspects of understanding the severe manifestations of ZIKV infection observed in the current outbreak in Latin America."
"9471583","Project Summary/Abstract Scientific research on the health effects of tobacco products is crucial to the Center for Tobacco Products (CTP) mission of reducing the burden of tobacco-related diseases. The health effects of tobacco products on the oral cavity are often overlooked even though this is the primary route of administration of tobacco products. The American Association for Dental Research (AADR) is a non-profit scientific association dedicated to advancing research and increasing knowledge for the improvement of oral health and to facilitating the communication and application of research findings. In accordance with the congruent missions of AADR and CTP, AADR is organizing an in-person scientific conference entitled, ?Oral Health Effects of Tobacco Products: Science and Regulatory Policy?. The conference will be held on February 6, 2018 at the Hyatt Regency Bethesda. The primary objectives of this conference are to provide scientific information about the oral health effects of tobacco products to support the regulatory and public health missions of CTP and to facilitate communication between scientists and tobacco product regulators. Proceedings from this conference will serve as health promotion materials to encourage cessation and deter initiation of tobacco product use. Conference sessions will be organized around the tobacco products regulated by CTP: smoked/combustible tobacco, smokeless tobacco, and electronic nicotine delivery systems. Each session will include 2-4 speakers followed by a panel discussion. Speakers will address claims of reduced risk from use of certain tobacco products and identify gaps in tobacco product oral health research that need to be addressed to aid the regulatory mission of CTP. Speakers will include experts in tobacco products and oral biology. A representative from CTP will provide a regulatory policy perspective. A representative from the National Maternal and Child Oral Health Resource Center will guide a discussion on the feasibility of an online resource for the oral health effects of tobacco products. Such a resource would provide a central location for scientific information on the oral health effects of tobacco products to educate a broad audience. Scientists, clinicians, federal research employees, public health advocates, and all others, regardless of professional background, are encouraged to attend. This conference will raise awareness of the oral health effects of tobacco products to support the shared mission of CTP and AADR to reduce the burden of tobacco-related diseases."
"9382849","The protozoan parasite Cryptosporidium is one of the most important causes of severe diarrheal disease, and the disease manifests itself with varied epidemiology around the world. In the U.S. outbreaks are linked to tainted recreational and drinking water and have occurred at massive scale. Patients suffering from immunosuppression due to HIV/AIDS, organ transplantation, or cancer are in gravest danger. The global public health impact is even larger: after Rotavirus, Cryptosporidium is the most important diarrheal pathogen in small children. In infants, in particular in the context of malnutrition, cryptosporidiosis has a highly significant imprint on overall early childhood mortality and morbidity. Cryptosporidiosis is also linked to stunting, thus leaving a lasting shadow on the future of children. There are no vaccines and only a single drug of marginal efficacy. This parasite has a single host life cycle, both asexual and sexual processes occur sequentially in the intestinal epithelium of the same host. Completion of this developmental program is required for continued infection, severe disease, and spread of the pathogen. Despite the obvious importance of the lifecycle for drug and vaccine development, our current understanding is rudimentary. This is a biological phenomenon of fascinating complexity ? there is much to discover here ? and we expect insights of fundamental as well as translational significance. We have recently pioneered a genetic system for Cryptosporidum that we will use in this project to dissect the lifecycle at the molecular and cellular level. Under this proposal we will develop rigorous molecular markers and assays for development through asexual and sexual stages, reveal stage specific gene expression, and discover the mechanisms that execute function and progression through the lifecycle. Lack of efficient systems to culture Cryptosporidium has long hampered progress. We will define where specifically in vitro development derails, and these insights will guide future work to facilitate a continuous culture model."
"9379839","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of the proposed research is to identify novel mechanisms that regulate type 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2). ILC2 are a recently discovered population of lineage-negative lymphocytes that produce Th2 cytokines in response to epithelial cytokines IL-33 and TSLP. ILC2 contribute to an asthma phenotype in animal models and are present in human lungs. Specifically, we hypothesize that the RNA-binding protein RBM3 controls human and mouse ILC2 Th2 cytokine production and innate type 2 lung responses through Th2 cytokine mRNA stabilization. We will administer allergen, IL-33, and TSLP challenges to the airways of WT and RBM3 knockout mice and assess lung ILC2 Th2 cytokine production and proliferation, as well as levels of BAL eosinophils, epithelial mucus production, peribronchial infiltration and airway hyperresponsiveness. We will also perform ILC2 adoptive transfer studies and generate RBM3 deficient IL-13 reporter mice to define the role of RBM3 in ILC2 during allergen, IL-33, and TSLP-induced airway inflammation. We will perform in vitro studies with purified ILC2 from WT and RBM3 knockout mice as well as human RMB3 siRNA knockdown ILC2 stimulated with IL-33 and TSLP and assess levels of ILC2 Th2 cytokine production and proliferation. Further, we will perform mRNA stability assays to determine whether RBM3 controls ILC2 function by stabilizing Th2 cytokine mRNAs. We expect to find that RMB3 promotes ILC2 Th2 cytokine mRNA stability and controls ILC2 Th2 cytokine production in vitro and in vivo. The novelty of the proposed studies includes use of novel reagents (RBM3-/-, RBM3-/-RAG2-/-, and RBM3-/-/YFP-IL-13 reporter mice) and uncovering a novel pathway (RNA binding protein) regulating a recently discovered cell type (ILC2) that contributes to allergic inflammation. Importantly, the discovery of molecules that regulate ILC2 function may reveal novel therapeutic targets to reduce ILC2 activation in asthma and allergic disease."
"9378711","Diabetic retinopathy remains the leading cause of visual loss in adults in the US, and it is increasing throughout the US and the world as diabetes rapidly affects more people. Although prolonged good glycemic control has been demonstrated to inhibit the development of diabetic retinopathy in patients, this goal is essentially impossible for most diabetics to maintain, so additional means are needed to inhibit the development of diabetic retinopathy. The Kern laboratory focuses on how diabetic retinopathy develops and thus can be inhibited. This research currently focuses on 4 research areas related to the development of diabetic retinopathy, most of which initially were reported by or championed by Dr. Kern and his collaborators: (1) the role of leukocytes and inflammation as a cause of diabetic retinopathy, and the regulation of those pro-inflammatory changes by epigenetic acetylation, (2) the role of retinal photoreceptor cells and vision itself in the development of the retinal vascular leakage and degeneration of diabetic retinopathy, (3) the use of low intensity light to inhibit and reverse diabetic retinopathy, and (4) the use of systems pharmacology of G-Protein Coupled Receptors to inhibit the retinopathy. Discussions are now underway to translate these findings into patients with diabetes."
"9395360","PROJECT SUMMARY The overall objective of this proposed research is to develop methods for the clinical assessment of lesion structure and activity. Improved imaging technologies employing non-ionizing radiation will significantly improve caries diagnosis and management. It is not sufficient to simply detect carious lesions, methods are needed to assess the activity of the lesion and determine if chemical intervention is needed. The central hypothesis underlying this proposal is that there are structural differences between active lesions due to caries, arrested lesions and developmental defects, and these differences can be quantified using optical imaging methods. There is a transparent highly mineralized outer surface zone presented on arrested lesions formed due to remineralization, which leads to decreased permeability to fluids including water and plaque generated acids. Previous studies have shown that the thickness of this surface zone can be measured nondestructively using polarization sensitive optical coherence tomography (PS-OCT), and have demonstrated that near-IR (NIR) reflectance and thermal imaging coupled with dehydration can be used to measure changes in the permeability of lesions in enamel and dentin. The overall objective of this proposal will be achieved through the following specific aims: (1) To test the hypothesis that the thickness of the highly mineralized transparent surface zone formed during remineralization correlates with the lesion permeability and activity; (2) To test the hypothesis that thermal and NIR reflectance dehydration methods can be used to measure the activity of secondary carious lesions around composite restorations; (3) To test the hypothesis that compact thermal and NIR reflectance probes for lesion activity assessment can be fabricated that are suitable for in vivo use. This project will allow us to determine the structural changes needed to arrest active lesions and provide methods for assessing the activity of lesions in a single examination to avoid unnecessary treatment and cavity preparations."
"9379446","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Allergic diseases are caused by inappropriate immune responses to harmless antigens, and in one form or another, affect 1 in 4 Americans in the United States with a disproportionate increase especially among children with asthma and food-related hypersensitivities. While malleable genetic and environmental components play an important role, immunological aspects associated with cellular and humoral aspects of atopy remain major risk factors underlying the pathogenesis of these diseases and allergic inflammation in general. Among the immune cells implicated in allergic disease, few have received in recent years the level of attention given to dendritic cells (DC) and basophils. DCs are best known for their capacity to act as antigen-presenting cells (APC) that induce immunological responses by presenting antigen to T cells. In mediating this activity, DCs play an important role in both the priming of adaptive immune responses and in the induction of peripheral tolerance. Ancillary studies in mice now indicate that basophils also possess APC capability that is most important in initiating the Th2 responses that are hallmark in allergic diseases. However, it remains unclear in humans whether specific DC subtypes (and/or basophils) preferentially support allergen-reactive Th2 responses, and whether/how these might be altered by immune-based intervention. Thus, three aims are proposed: Aim 1 addresses the general hypothesis that specific DC subtypes induce phenotypically and functionally distinct allergen-reactive T cell responses. In particular, experiments investigate plasmacytoid and myeloid DC (pDC and mDC, respectively) as well as basophils for their potential to differentially induce T cell responses in dust mite allergic subjects. Since new evidence points to basophils playing a role in modulating DC activity rather than acting as APCs, then this hypothesis will also be investigated. Aim 2 addresses the hypothesis that pDC, mDC, and basophils are differentially primed by innate immune stimuli (e.g. TLR ligands) and by specific cytokines (IL-3/IL-33 vs. IFN-?/) to differentially induce allergen-reactive Th2 and/or Th1 cell responses. Finally, Aim 3 addresses the hypothesis that successful Standard Immunotherapy (SIT) alters the capacity of DC subtypes (and basophils) to promote allergen-specific Th2 cell responses. In particular, our preliminary data show that SIT improves TLR9-dependent innate immune responses in DC that are impaired in allergic disease. We further predict that this increased activity will parallel with increases in IgG4 blocking activity, the induction of allergen-specific Tregs, and clinical improvement. Our unique ability to investigate human DC and basophils makes this application highly innovative, and increases the probability that novel, significant, and clinically relevant findings will be discovered."
"9378063","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Using structural approaches (cryo-electron microscopy and x-ray crystallography), we will investigate the mechanisms used by coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) to enter host cells by engaging two receptors (decay accelerating factor and coxsackievirus and adenovirus receptor). CVB3 is a human pathogen that causes myocarditis, pancreatitis, and has been implicated in the onset of juvenile diabetes mellitus. Our proposed studies of CVB3 entry are a continuation of a productive collaboration with Dr. Jeffery Bergelson, Division of Infectious Diseases at Children's Hospital at Philadelphia. A combination of traditional and innovative methods will be used to visualize both receptor binding and the resulting conformational changes that lead to entry and uncoating. Of particular interest is a novel entry intermediate that has never been observed (Aim 1). This particle has been isolated with fingerlike density projections extruding from the capsid, and these densities are hypothesized to be peptides used to anchor the particle to the host membrane. We will investigate the capability of this new particle (and other entry intermediates) to bind receptors and infect the host. In addition to conventional structural studies made with purified virus and recombinant receptor proteins in solution (Aim 2), the full-length receptor will be anchored onto a lipid bilayer disc to form virus-receptor complexes for an in situ asymmetric study (Aim 3). This approach simulates the physiological binding event, in which the virus interacts with receptors at a single, focused region on its capsid. Preliminary results with this asymmetric approach suggest the virus behaves differently when interacting with a few membrane-bound receptors compared to many soluble receptors. Specifically our in situ A-particle retains an intact genome (as the A-particle does in an infection) and undergoes different protein rearrangements compared to particles that are treated with soluble receptors or heat. The proposed study is directed at understanding the structural alterations that an enterovirus capsid must undergo to uncoat after successfully finding and attaching to the receptor in situ."
"9389479","PROJECT SUMMARY: Many infectious diseases exhibit differential severity between the sexes yet the mechanisms driving such innate biases are incompletely understood. Staphylococcus aureus (SA), including methicillin-resistant (MRSA), is the most common cause of skin and soft tissue infection (SSTI) in the US, and males have a greater than 2-fold higher incidence of infection versus females. Neutrophils are essential for clearance of SA skin infections, and we found that, consistent with murine infection outcomes, neutrophils from female mice are better able to clear SA ex vivo compared to neutrophils from male mice. Major contributors to neutrophil killing of SA include oxidative burst, antimicrobial factors in neutrophil granules, and neutrophil extracellular traps (NET). Therefore, in this exploratory proposal, we aim to align the efficacy of neutrophil phagocytosis and killing of SA ex vivo with measurements of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and nitric oxide (NO) production, NET formation, and changes in gene and protein expression and activation, to define the mechanism(s) of sex-specific phagocyte efficacy against SA. Furthermore, we have identified sex-specific modulators which enhance phagocyte efficacy and will determine the mechanisms by which these modulators augment innate defense. Upon the successful completion of these aims, we will have gained significant insight into the mechanisms of sex-specific phagocyte efficacy against SA, as well as mechanisms and/or targets for augmenting host innate defense."
"9242460","Schizophrenia is a leading cause of disability for Veterans. Due to the lack of an effective treatment, Veterans with schizophrenia suffer a myriad of cognitive impairments, including deficits in attention, memory, and processing speed. As a result, patients struggle on the job, in relationships, and in day-to-day activities, contributing to an overall poor quality of life.  New treatments for cognitive dysfunction in schizophrenia clearly are needed. A potentially powerful approach for developing and evaluating novel therapeutics is to combine behavioral/neurocognitive outcome measures with functional imaging of a drug's effects on a neurobiological marker. A topic of current great interest in schizophrenia research is the finding that patients show increased activity of the hippocampus, particularly at ?rest? or in other similar conditions of low cognitive load. This increased activity has been hypothesized to prevent further recruitment of the region as task demands increase, contributing to cognitive dysfunction. Furthermore, recently published work has demonstrated that cognitive performance in schizophrenia is negatively correlated with resting hippocampal activity. It follows that a drug treatment capable of reducing resting hippocampal activity may improve cognition in patients.  Recent findings have demonstrated that low doses of the anti-epileptic drug levetiracetam (LEV) reduce hippocampal hyperactivity and improve performance on a memory task in patients with mild cognitive impairment. LEV also reduces hippocampal hyperactivity in mouse models of Alzheimer's disease, an effect also recently shown in a mouse model of schizophrenia. Unlike other anti-epileptics, LEV improves cognition in epilepsy patients. The drug is well tolerated at doses several fold higher than that used to demonstrate its effects on the hippocampus. As such, it is possible that low-dose LEV may be a useful strategy for reducing hippocampal hyperactivity and improving cognition in schizophrenia.  A thorough investigation of the hypothesis that LEV will reduce hippocampal hyperactivity and improve cognition in Veterans with schizophrenia is proposed. In the first Aim, functional magnetic resonance imaging will be used to determine the lowest dose at which LEV engages the biological target of interest, hippocampal hyperactivity. This Aim will use a 2-week open-label crossover design to examine the effects of two low doses of LEV (125 mg b.i.d. and [62.5] mg b.i.d.) on resting hippocampal activity in schizophrenia. The second Aim will then use the dose optimized in Aim 1 in a 4-week placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized, parallel design to assess the cognitive effects of LEV, utilizing the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neurological Status (RBANS). The relationship between LEV effects on hippocampal activity and its effects on cognitive performance also will be examined.  This project will use a novel approach to investigate the efficacy of a potential new pharmacologic target in schizophrenia. The project also will evaluate hippocampal hyperactivity as a biomarker in schizophrenia by examining its ability to predict treatment response. Understanding the cognitive and neurobiological effects of LEV will provide an early indication of whether LEV can be repurposed to enhance cognitive function in Veterans with schizophrenia."
"9379450","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite the importance of mast cells (MCs) in innate and acquired immunity, their development and recruitment into the skin is not well understood. Our findings suggest that the skin microbiome has a strong influence on migrating and, in particular, maturing MCs in the skin. Based on our preliminary data, we have demonstrated that bacterial products at the skin surface participate in the regulation of MC antimicrobial functions, homing to the skin, and help them respond to their survival growth factor, SCF. Even more important is the ability of the microbiome to induce an anti-inflammatory phenotype on human MCs that contributes to maintaining skin homeostasis, which helps avoid unnecessary inflammation. Antibiotic exposure, and a pseudo-aseptic environment, have the potential to alter the skin microbiome selectively and may be the cause of the increasing incidence of human disorders such as atopic dermatitis. We hypothesize that bacterial products, increase mast cell recruitment and are responsible for maintaining high levels of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) and a low pro-inflammatory cytokine profile. A humanized mouse model system will enable the simultaneous study of both human MC migration pathways and TLR innate immune responses in a genetically adaptable organism, thereby translating our findings to human skin. We propose the following: a) Determine whether bacterial products from the skin microbiome are required for normal mast cell localization and function. The use of germ free and antibiotic treated mice will allow us to test whether disruption of the normal skin microbiome results in improper localization and function in vivo and whether reconstituting the microbiome can reverse these effects. Because human MCs may have a different sensitivity to the microbiome, we will test our findings on human MCs (huMCs) to provide a foundation for future translational research. b) Clarify the signaling pathways that are responsible for MC sensing the skin microbiome and how activation of these pathways affects MC function. We will focus on characterizing the MC receptors involved in sensing bacterial byproducts. The aspects to be studied: 1. Commensal activity directly on MC receptors (TLR ligands), 2. Commensal activity on keratinocytes that generate ligands (SCF, IL-1, and S1P) for MC receptors, and 3. Commensal activity on Endothelial cells (SCF) that generate ligands for MC receptors. c) Determine how MC interaction with the microbiome modulates intracellular pathways in skin MCs and affects their function. Our preliminary data show that bacterial byproducts modulate huMCs maturation and activation through NF-kB, S1P and intracellular sphingokinases (Sphks) pathways to produce S1P; we have found that LTA and other commensal fractions induce the expression of specific miRNAs that interfere with TLR-NF-kB signaling."
"9315345","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The sense of touch is vital for our survival, as it is essential for purposes as simple as picking up a fork and as complex as bonding with a newborn. Despite its importance for accomplishing basic tasks, the molecular and cellular mechanisms that convert a force on the skin into a neural signal are poorly understood. The long term goal of this research is to elucidate how receptors in the skin convert a touch stimulus into a neural signal to inform our brains about the physical world. We use Merkel cell-neurite complexes, which are conserved discriminative touch receptors, as a model to study these processes. Merkel cells are epithelial derived target cells that contact the endings of sensory neurons that send information to the central nervous system. Stimulating these Merkel cell-neurite complexes generates slowly adapting type I responses, which are important for detecting object features such as edges and curvature. Our previous studies revealed that Merkel cells directly sense mechanical force and convey this information to the underlying sensory neurons. The molecules that govern this process are completely unknown. Numerous molecules involved in synaptic transmission and neurotransmitters have been identified in Merkel cells, yet attempts to identify signaling mechanisms in vivo have yielded contradictory results. Thus, the objective of this research is to identify mechanisms by which Merkel cells convey tactile information to the nervous system. We will accomplish this goal by using an innovative combination of transgenic mice, optogenetics, in vitro and ex vivo physiology, and behavioral studies. Our central hypothesis is that Merkel cells release neurotransmitters at TeNT-sensitive SNARE-dependent chemical synapses to excite firing in tactile afferents. In Aim 1, we will determine whether Merkel cells employ TeNT-sensitive SNARE-mediated vesicular release. Aim 2 will identify the neurotransmitter or neuromodulatory pathways that excite Merkel-cell afferent neurons. These studies will yield fundamental insights into peripheral tactile  mechanisms, which is essential to advance basic knowledge of principles that govern encoding of somatic senses."
"9581501","Contact PD/PI: Lechner, William V SUMMARY Smoking remains the leading cause of preventable death in the United States, and current first-line treatments leave the majority of tobacco dependent individuals unable to quit. The inability to quit despite motivation to do so, is thought to result in part, from self-control failure. Working memory (WM) deficits contribute to imbalanced self-control and allow automatic impulses to drive behavior. Thus, WM plays a critical role in addictive behavior, and is particularly relevant to smoking. Indeed, a strong link between WM and smoking has been established in the literature; most notably, degree of WM impairment and deficits in activation in associated brain regions predict time to relapse, and WM moderates the relationship between craving and relapse. Given these insights, researchers have been examining interventions that may target WM including WM training (WMT) and repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS). WMT involves taxing this executive function repeatedly over time and has shown positive preliminary results in improving measures of self-control and reducing consumption of addictive substances. Similarly, rTMS, a non-invasive brain stimulation procedure that stimulates neuronal tissues and increases cortical excitability, has been shown to increase WM capacity and reduce craving and consumption of several addictive substances including nicotine. While these interventions have demonstrated initial promise in affecting addictive behaviors, the magnitude and durability of their effects may be limited. Recently, researchers have posited ? but not yet empirically tested ? that WMT administered in combination with rTMS may result in an additive or supra-additive effect in treating addictive processes. This is highly significant; the clinical utility of rTMS over current first line treatments may be limited if factors with potential to enhance its effectiveness are not examined. Given these recent advances in the literature, the primary objective of the proposed study is to evaluate the individual and combined effects of Working Memory (WM) training and repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) on WM performance and smoking behaviors as well as critical mediators of these effects. These aims will be examined in a sample of tobacco dependent adults (N=130) utilizing a 2x2 factorial experimental design including four groups (WMT+rTMS, sham WMT+rTMS, WMT+sham TMS, and sham WMT+sham rTMS) capable of isolating independent and combined effects of WMT and rTMS. Baseline assessment will include a smoking analogue task with high translational value, followed by 10 sessions of working memory training over two weeks prior to the initiation of rTMS. rTMS will consist of 10 sessions over two weeks with 10 Hz stimulation (2000 pulses per session) applied over the left DLPFC, with working memory training co-occurring with stimulation. The study will assess neurocognitive, psychological, and behavioral mediators at multiple time points between baseline and final outcome assessment. Project Summary/Abstract Page 7"
"9469909","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The purpose of this NIH F31-Diversity application is to obtain support for the PI, Kristin Olson, for mentored research and career development activities within her MD/PhD degree training that will strengthen her potential to become a successful physician scientist. The project goal is to develop skills in statistical genetics that will allow the PI to study the influence of immunogenetic determinants on Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) infection outcomes in women, including methods of genetic data quality control, imputation, multiple testing corrections, and pathway analyses. The primary objective of the research proposal is to investigate the immunogenetic determinants of Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) reinfection and CT-associated infertility in women. CT infection is the most prevalent sexually transmitted bacterial infection worldwide, including in the U.S. CT disproportionately affects women due to the reproductive morbidity it causes. Up to 20% of women experience reinfection after treatment and inflammation from repeated CT infection episodes can contribute to risk for CT- associated infertility. It is unknown why some women remain susceptible to CT after treatment, leading to reinfection, and why some CT infections lead to infertility. This project seeks to determine genetic risk markers for CT reinfection and CT-related infertility (Aims 1A and 2A), and then utilize complex statistical methods to predict the immune responses mediated by these genetic markers (Aims 1B and 2B). The central hypothesis is that genetic factors influence risk for these CT infection outcomes through specific immunological pathways, and some genetic factors may contribute to both clinical outcomes while others may be unique for only one of the clinical outcomes. The long-term objective of our research is to understand immunogenetic factors that influence CT infection outcomes in order to develop strategies for improving prevention and management of CT infection, such as optimizing chlamydia screening strategies and development of a chlamydia vaccine.  The proposed training plan for the PI is sponsored by her project co-mentors, Dr. William Geisler and Dr. Hemant Tiwari. Included in the training plan are experiences that help the PI develop in three major areas: 1) rigorous research in the CT field, including developing familiarity with the existing CT literature, critically evaluating published CT studies, principles of scientific integrity and responsible conduct of research, and methods of rigor and reproducibility; 2) statistical genetics, including methodology and interpretation of results; and 3) career and professional development, including learning skills in grant writing, journal reviewing, presenting, and translation of research findings to clinical applications. The overall goal of the training plan is to provide the PI with a solid foundation for a successful career as a physician scientist, with the ultimate career goal of leading a collaborative research team that bridges the gap between laboratory-based research and systems-based research in the context of improving reproductive health outcomes for women."
"9379452","Project Summary/Abstract HIV initially assembles as a non-infectious, immature particle that must undergo a maturation process to become infectious. Assembly and maturation involve large-scale rearrangements of the viral capsid. These large-scale rearrangements, in turn, are associated with programmed local conformational changes in capsid protein segments termed molecular switches. In these studies, we will use structural, biophysical, and other complementary approaches to understand the structure of the immature HIV-1 capsid and how a molecular switch spanning the CA-SP1 region of the HIV-1 Gag protein controls immature virus assembly and maturation. We propose to: (1) Test the hypothesis that the CA-SP1 junction folds into a 6-helix bundle that undergoes reversible and cooperative unfolding and folding within immature virions to regulate access of the viral protease during maturation. We will also determine how small molecule maturation inhibitors like bevirimat disrupt this process by binding and stabilizing the 6-helix bundle. We will also initiate experiments to understand how Gag-Gag interactions change during the early stages of maturation. (2) Elucidate the detailed molecular organization of the immature HIV-1 Gag lattice. In particular, we will determine the high resolution details of how the outermost set of Gag-Gag interactions (mediated by the CA-NTD domain) are organized within the immature particle. We will also test the hypotheses that interactions between the CA-NTD layer and the underlying CA-CTD layer are important for proper assembly and may be part of a structural network that links two molecular switches that flank the CA region. Finally, we will also analyze the immature Gag lattices of other retroviruses, in order to elucidate the general nature of switch-mediated Gag assembly. If successful, these studies will lead to a thorough understanding of the immature capsid structure of retroviruses, how local conformational transitions translate into large-scale capsid rearragenements during retroviral assembly and maturation, and how small molecule inhibitors may be deployed to disrupt capsid rearrangement."
"9386071","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Zika virus (ZIKV) is an emerging mosquito-borne virus that is causing explosive outbreaks. While asymptomatic in most healthy adults, ZIKV infection of pregnant women causes severe developmental complications of fetuses, including fetal death, microcephaly and a variety of other neurological complications. No animal model of fetal ZIKV infection is currently available. Because adult rhesus macaques can be infected with Zika virus, including isolates from recent outbreaks, it is important to investigate if ZIKV infection of fetal macaques has similar detrimental effects. The development of a nonhuman primate model of fetal pathogenesis, that affords precise experimental control, is critical to (i) determine the mechanisms of how ZIKV infection affects the developing fetus, including the fetal brain and other parts of the central nervous system, and (ii) to develop and screen intervention strategies, including vaccines and therapeutics. The proposed pilot studies, aimed at demonstrating proof-of-concept, have been designed to test whether ZIKV infection initiated at different times of gestation can recapitulate the spectrum of outcomes described in ZIKV-infected pregnant women, and determine how the timing of ZIKV infection in pregnancy associates with markers of viral replication, viral distribution, immune markers and pathology. The overarching objective of the proposed work is to develop a NHP model of fetal pathogenesis, ultimately allowing scientists to expedite clinical trials with the ultimate goal of curtailing the ZIKV pandemic as quickly as possible."
"9241539","ABSTRACT Individualized therapeutics for K-RAS mutant lung adenocarcinoma are nonexistent. Recently, we have described a unique interaction between activated K-Ras and the Type II cell that explains the unique ability of the Type II cell to proliferate in response to K-Ras activation. The absence of the transcription factor Sox2 allows Notch to be upregulated when K-Ras is activated. In addition, K-Ras is able to induce a transcriptional program that dedifferentiates distal lung epithelial cells into distal progenitors that are proliferative and multipotent during development. These distal stem cells express Sox9 as well as Ezh2. In this proposal, we will examine the effects of proximalizing Type II cells with Sox2 activation and Notch inhibition and Ezh2 inhibition on tumor initiation in Aim 1. This will involve inducible mouse transgenic alleles and human cell lines and human cells and tumors. We will also test the ef?cacy of a novel Sox2- mimetic compound, RepSox, for anti-tumor activity in K-Ras activated distal epithelial cells. In Aim 2, we will test the hypothesis that proximalization of the Type II cells suppresses progression of established K- Ras mutant adenocarcinomas. Finally, in Aim 3, we will assess the tumor suppression of Sox2 activation and Notch inhibition in more genetically complex tumors (K-Ras mutant, p53 knockout). We hypothesize that proximalization therapy will be tumor suppressive and potentially also chemosensitizing. Successful completion of these aims could help tens of thousands of patients per year. 1"
"9379855","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Developmental exposure to environmental chemicals is a significant public health problem. In the United States alone, one in six children has some form of developmental disability. Many of these cases are attributed to developmental exposure to toxicants. There are also strong indications that some of these exposures increase the risk of adult-onset diseases such as diabetes, hypertension and cardiovascular diseases. Recent studies have implicated epigenetic mechanisms such as DNA methylation in the persistent effects of developmental exposure to toxicants. DNA methylation plays an essential role in development and it involves the chemical modification of DNA by the addition of a methyl group to the cytosine nucleotide by DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) enzymes. DNMT3 group of enzymes are responsible for the establishment of de novo methylation patterns, but it is not known how they target specific DNA sequences for methylation, and how toxicants alter the methylation patterns. In this R01 grant application, the investigators propose to investigate the role of DNMT3s in normal development, as well as in the long-term effects of developmental exposure to toxicants. Using zebrafish, a well-established developmental and toxicological model system, the investigators propose to characterize DNMT3 functions and to determine their role in the response to environmental toxicants. In aim 1, the investigators will test the hypothesis that DNMT3s show DNA target specificity, with each DNMT3 paralog targeting a unique set of genes, thereby establishing DNA methylation patterns. They will determine DNMT3 target specificity in vitro by using an episomal methylation assay and characterizing the sequence specificity of recombinant DNMT3 isoforms, and in vivo using DNMT3- knockout zebrafish. In aim 2, the investigators will test the hypothesis that toxicants alter DNA methylatio patterns, and that these alterations are DNMT3-dependent. They will expose wild-type and DNMT3-knockout zebrafish embryos to environmentally relevant toxicants during sensitive windows of development, and determine the effects on DNA methylation patterns using Reduced Representation Bisulfite Sequencing (RRBS), a genome-wide approach for measuring DNA methylation in CpG rich regions of the genome. In Aim 3, the investigators will test the hypothesis that differentially methylated DNA regions in toxicant-exposed embryos show increased occupancy by DNMT3s. They will expose the zebrafish embryos to a toxicant that induces DNA methylation changes and determine chromatin occupancy using Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) followed by bisulfite sequencing (ChIP-BS-Seq). Overall, the proposed studies will demonstrate the functions of DNMT3s in establishing DNA methylation patterns during normal development and in mediating toxicant-induced effects."

This chemical has been detected  in the Cape Fear River in North Carolina. The Cape Fear River serves as a drinking water source for  ~300,000 residents in the lower Cape Fear River basin, including residents of New Hanover,  Brunswick, and Pender Counties. In June 2017, community concern about this chemical in drinking  water resulted in multiple public meetings of citizens trying to obtain information about their  potential exposure and resulting health effects associated with consumption of drinking water.  As  a result of community concern, the chemical plant has reportedly stopped discharging GenX into the  river. However, it is still measurable in finished drinking water and community concern still  exists. This project is designed to help address community questions about GenX exposure and health  effects. Little is known about how GenX is stored in the body, the toxicity of GenX, or how long  the chemical will remain in the environment. To address these questions, we plan to conduct a  community-based study of lower Cape Fear River area residents who are served by public utility  water. We will work with community partners of the Cape Fear River Watch and the New Hanover County  Department of Health to help identify a representative sample of residents, to collect biological  samples, and to keep the community informed about what is known about GenX and what the study  finds. We plan to recruit ~400 Wilmington area residents (100 men, 100 women, 100 boys, 100 girls)  to provide blood, urine, and drinking water samples and to complete a questionnaire on their water  use history. We plan to analyze blood, urine, and drinking water for GenX and related chemicals;  blood and urine samples will also be used for clinical tests (lipid profile, thyroid function,  liver function, and urinalysis). All results from the study will be shared with both the community  as a whole and each individual participant.

"9395430","Project Summary The identification of biomarkers for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) has been prioritized as the next crucial step in advancing the assessment, diagnosis, and treatment of PTSD (National Research Action Plan, 2013). Research has identified several genes as promising biomarker candidates for PTSD in adults. Yet, little research has examined genetic associations with PTSD in children, even though children are vulnerable to PTSD. Furthermore, recent evidence suggests that children and adults may have distinct PTSD symptom presentations, which highlights the need for investigating genetic associations with PTSD specifically in a child sample. Identifying genes associated with childhood PTSD would aid efforts to optimize the assessment and diagnosis of PTSD in children. This study would be the first to investigate promising candidate genes for PTSD (SLC6A3, DRD2, TPH2, 5HTR2A, FKBP5, ADCYAP1R1) in school-age children (7-11 years). Furthermore, this study would take the innovative step of examining genetic associations with specific symptoms (e.g., hypervigilance) and symptom clusters (e.g., arousal), which may yield insight into mechanisms through which these genes contribute to PTSD risk and inform future directions for research. Dopaminergic system genes (SLC6A3 and DRD2) are expected to be associated with PTSD symptoms related to arousal. Serotonergic system genes (TPH2 and 5HTR2A) are expected to be associated with symptoms related to alterations in cognitions or mood. Genes associated with hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis regulation (FKBP5 and ADCYAP1R1) are expected to be associated with arousal and may be particularly relevant for children, as prior research has found that these genes interact with childhood trauma to predict PTSD in adults; however, no study has examined whether these genes are associated with PTSD in a child sample. The study will also utilize a longitudinal design. Prior longitudinal research has shown that some children recover from PTSD symptoms over time, whereas other children have chronic PTSD. This study will investigate whether genetic associations can predict which children show chronic patterns of distress by examining genetic associations with PTSD symptom severity at two time points (8 months and 15 months postdisaster). Data will be drawn from an ethnically-diverse sample of school-age children exposed to a devastating natural disaster (Hurricane Ike) who provided saliva samples and completed questionnaire measures at two time points. Training will include directed readings, coursework, workshops, conference participation, manuscript preparation, and mentorship via regular face-to-face meetings with experts in childhood PTSD and human genetics. The training received through this NRSA will place the applicant in a position to become a successful independent researcher."
"9377532","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Pneumococcal vaccination is underused in underserved minorities, who are at greater pneumococcal disease risk. Two vaccines are available, the older pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV) and the 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13). However, the optimally protective vaccination regimen is unclear, due to changing epidemiology and uncertain vaccine effectiveness; both should become clearer soon. Current CDC vaccination recommendations are complex and may not optimally protect the underserved, due multiple barriers to effective implementation. Vaccine uptake could improve with either better implementation of cur- rent recommendations or broader CDC recommendations that are easier to implement, which could have pro-portionately greater effects on the underserved. Clinical trials comparing these strategies are unlikely and, due to the moving target of vaccination-related epidemiologic changes and US Affordable Care Act (ACA) effects on vaccination rates, could be unhelpful. To investigate these issues, a systematic synthesis of available data and evidence-based projections with rigor- ous modeling of uncertainty is planned to assist policymaking and inform research resource allocation. Potential changes to decrease the complexity of pneumococcal vaccination recommendations (using PPSV and/or PCV13) will be modeled and compared to current recommendations implemented under programs to improve vaccination rates. Specific aims are to: 1) compare the public health impact on underserved minority populations of potential CDC adult pneumococcal vaccination recommendations, specifically addressing age-based vs. the more complex comorbidity-based use of vaccine; and 2) determine the public health impact and cost- effectiveness of implementation programs to improve vaccination rates in underserved minorities and persons <65 with high risk conditions, compared to potential CDC vaccination recommendations from Aim 1. Vaccination strategies will be compared via Markov model-based cost-effectiveness analysis, with probabilistic sensitivity analysis and value of information analysis to determine favored strategies and identify the most valuable areas for future research. Analyses will also innovatively use the CDC-recommended RE-AIM framework to evaluate implementation program options and explore interactions between ACA effects, potential CDC recommendations, and race-specific pneumococcal disease characteristics. Since CDC vaccination recommendation evaluations increasingly consider economic analyses, analysis results can be used, as they have previously, to assist vaccination recommendation decisions and potentially change vaccination policy to better protect the underserved."
"9384714","Project Summary/Abstract Little is understood about the physiological or regulatory factors of Streptococcus pyogenes that enable switching between its commensal-like and virulent states. This proposal describes experimental approaches that seek to continue defining and characterizing quorum-sensing regulatory pathways that correspond to phenotypes consistent with the avirulent lifestyle of Streptococcus pyogenes (Group A Streptococcus; GAS). The quorum sensing network in Streptococcus pyogenes utilizing short hydrophobic peptide (SHP) pheromones and the pheromone receptors Rgg2 and Rgg3 regulates several phenotypes, including biofilm development, cell aggregation, aminoglycoside susceptibility, and lysozyme resistance, by an unknown mechanism. Our studies indicate that each of these phenotypes depend upon the expression of a small protein of unknown function. We hypothesize that this protein, referred to as StcB, is an inhibitor of an enzyme(s) that targets peptidoglycan bonds of the cell wall. Additional studies indicate the target of StcB is a murein hydrolase enzyme, called Isp, that contains cysteine and histidine-dependent amidohydrolase/peptidase (CHAP) and acetylglucosaminidase domains. Governance of StcB and Isp by the Rgg2/3 quorum sensing pathway accounts for significant changes to the bacterial cell surface, resulting in differential attachment to fibronectin and epithelial cells, and differential immuno- modulatory activities. This proposal seeks to elucidate the mechanisms by which StcB and Isp enzymes account for biochemical changes to the surface of S. pyogenes, how these changes lead to differential activity of surface structures and proteins, and how these changes affect the ability of S. pyogenes to colonize the host and modulate immune activities."

They initially infect the liver as sporozoites, then they replicate as liver stages within hepatocytes to generate exoerythrocytic merozoites that initiate symptomatic blood stage infection. These preerythrocytic stages of infection are clinically silent and were thought to not provoke a significant innate immune response. Yet, recent findings from our group and collaborators have shown that preerythrocytic stages induce a pronounced innate immune response in the liver. The mechanisms by which these complex parasites induce an innate immune response and the downstream effects of these responses on parasite infection remain poorly defined. Understanding the innate immune response to this eukaryotic, intracellular pathogen is important in its own right but also a critical missing piece in the puzzl to understand the development of sterilizing adaptive immunity engendered by whole parasite immunizations. Therefore, we propose to identify which innate immune responses are activated by wild-type and attenuated Plasmodium preerythrocytic parasites and to determine how these innate immune responses influence protective adaptive immune responses. Using gene expression analysis and functional assays, we have shown that liver stage infection induces an innate immune response mediated by type I and type II interferon (IFN) signaling pathways. We have also shown that lymphocytes infiltrate the liver within days following infection and that this infiltration is strongly dependent on type I IFN (IFN-1) signaling. Furthermore, this innate response reduces the initial infection. These results indicate a link between IFN-1, lymphocyte recruitment, and subsequent innate parasite elimination. Our preliminary data also shows that this IFN-1 driven innate response shapes the adaptive immune response that is engendered by whole parasite immunizations. This we demonstrate with mice deficient in key IFN-1 signaling molecules, which surprisingly, are better protected by whole parasite immunizations. In this proposal, we intend to further delineate the generation and consequences of an IFN-mediated innate immune response to Plasmodium liver infection. In Aim 1 we will identify the host-parasite interactions that initiate this IFN-mediated innate immune response and identify the cell types in the liver that respond to IFN. In Aim 2 we will characterize cell-specific responses withi the liver following infection and identify cytokine and chemokine receptors that are necessary for innate lymphocyte infiltration. Additionally, we will evaluate the cellular mechanisms by which these innate cells eliminate liver stage parasites. Finally, in Aim 3, we will investigate how IFN-1-mediated signaling influences the development of adaptive immune responses engendered by whole parasite immunizations. Understanding the nature of the early innate immune response will reveal how a complex eukaryotic parasite engages early host immune defenses. Equally important, it will also identify innate molecular pathways to target for improvement of adaptive immune responses after vaccination that aims to protect against malaria infection."
"9555322","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The self-assembling process in articular cartilage is emerging as a potentially robust approach for engineering large and small cartilage constructs. The objective of this proposal is to evaluate self-assembled articular cartilage in resurfacing the patella by quantifying the biologic response (i.e., host response to the construct), dose response (i.e., identifying the minimum number of necessary cells), and durability (i.e., stability, integriy, and maturation over a year), as defined by the FDA. Statistical optimization to improve the functionality of self- assembled cartilage constructs has yielded a powerful combination of externally applied stimuli that result in constructs with biomechanical and biochemical properties on par with those of native cartilage. Among a multitude of helpful stimuli, three have emerged as quite potent: hydrostatic pressure (10MPa at 0Hz during days 10-14), TGF-1 (30 ng/ml for 2 wks), and chondroitinase ABC (applied at 2 wks), applied in combination. Mechanisms linking these stimuli to the engineered tissues' biomechanical properties have also been elucidated to explain their synergisms and to consolidate them into simple culture protocols. A functionality index (FI) allowing the establishment of quantitative success criteria and validated for the comparison of constructs to native tissue showed that construct properties have attained FI values approaching 1, the value of native tissue. Based on these promising results and additional in vivo murine, leporine, and ovine data, this proposal will investigate the global hypothesis that constructs will show durability without an adverse host response via three aims: The objective of Aim 1 is to use a short-term (12wks), leporine patella resurfacing model to examine the hypotheses that: 1) not only will constructs retain stability and integrity in vivo, thir FI values will be improved by implantation, and 2) neither the allogeneic cells nor the culture products will elicit adverse host responses (local/systemic). Aim 2 employs the murine model to validate that implant scale-up would not alter neocartilage biomechanical properties. Aim 2 will also address certain challenges that are common across diverse cartilage regeneration strategies, namely initial fixation, subsequent integration, and durability against wear; these issues will be tackled using a chondroconductive glue, exogenous lysyl oxidase, and the chondrotuning method that yields robust and lubricious implants. Finally, Aim 3 will test the hypothesis that durable healing can be achieved for up to 12 months in an ovine model. This aim will also identify a minimum cell number that can be employed to achieve effective healing at 1 year. By following FDA's guidance document (Preparation of IDEs and INDs for products intended to repair or replace knee cartilage), and if the proposed study's hypotheses are proven, the results will provide exciting validation of the clinical translatability of self-assembed articular cartilage constructs."
"9391001","PROJECT SUMMARY  Despite the availability of antibiotics to combat Tuberculosis (TB), it is one of the leading causes of death due to infectious disease. Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) is a successful pathogen because it survives within immune cells and effectively establishes and maintains a latent TB infection. Therefore, understanding the mechanisms underlying the establishment or maintenance of dormancy can inform new strategies for TB therapeutics.  Mycobacterial membrane protein large (MmpL) proteins are dedicated cell wall lipid transporters. Along with their accessory Mycobacterial membrane protein small (MmpS) proteins, these transporters are crucial players in mycobacterial physiology and pathogenesis. MmpL3 is essential; and MmpL4, MmpL5, MmpL7, MmpL8, MmpL10 and MmpL11 contribute to Mtb virulence. The related proteins MmpL3 and MmpL11 that transport mycolic acid-containing lipids are of particular interest to us. MmpL3 transports trehalose monomycolate and is required for mycobacterial replication and viability. We showed that MmpL11 transports monomeromycolyl diacylglycerol and a mycolate ester wax. These are species of lipids that are sometimes referred to as ?storage lipids? and are associated with dormant bacteria in vitro and accumulate in granulomas of TB patients. Therefore, it appears that MmpL11 plays a role in a clinically relevant, but poorly understood, aspect of Mtb pathogenesis.  While significant advances have been made identifying MmpL substrates, the regulation of MmpL protein expression and their role in cell wall remodeling in different environmental conditions has not been explored. The proposed studies will characterize the structure and function of Mtb transcriptional regulators that control expression of essential and virulence-associated MmpL and MmpS proteins. Our preliminary data indicate that fatty acids directly modulate activity of these unique transcription factors. This suggests a model where Mtb can directly assess and respond to fatty acid intermediates, metabolic state and nutrient availability to control mmpL and mmpS gene regulation. By defining the molecular mechanisms underlying the regulation of MmpL transporters and identifying their regulons, we will generate novel insights into the transition between actively dividing Mtb and latent or non-replicating persistent Mtb. !"
"9379392","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The ESKAPE pathogens, including Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumanii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterobacter species are life- threatening superbugs due to their ability to escape the killing of traditional antibiotics. According to the Centers for Diseas Control and Prevention, these six types of bad bugs cause two thirds of the health care-associated infections, leading to 99,000 deaths annually in the United States. It is stunning that the annual frequency of deaths from Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is comparable to those caused by HIV/AIDS. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop new treatments against superbugs. Naturally occurring antimicrobial peptides are universal host defense molecules that have retained their potency throughout the years. To effectively exploit these interesting compounds, we have been constructing, expanding, and updating the widely used Antimicrobial Peptide Database (APD; http://aps.unmc.edu/AP). This comprehensive database facilitates naming, classification, statistical analysis, search, prediction and design of novel antimicrobials with desired properties. The APD tool has facilitated the research and education in the antimicrobial peptide field and laid a solid basis for this project. Based on our preliminary results, we hypothesize that most critical parameters can be extracted from the APD as a basis for designing and optimizing potent antimicrobial peptides that cause damage on bacterial membranes, leading to bacterial death and augmenting host defense. To test our hypothesis, we have designed the following specific aims: (1) To identify the critical parameters that determine potency of antimicrobial peptides and their mimics based on the APD; (2) To elucidate the critical modulator in antimicrobial peptides that determines mechanism of action and potential bacterial response genes; and (3) To examine the efficacy of database-designed peptides and their mimics against bacterial biofilm infection in vivo and mechanisms of immune modulation. To accomplish these aims, the PI has assembled a strong team that provides complementary expertise needed to understand host-pathogen interactions at the genetic, protein, and structural level as well as peptide-mediated immune responses in vivo using animal models. Because our database-designed compounds represent a novel antimicrobial strategy that effectively attenuated resistant superbugs both in vitro and in vivo, the outcome of this innovative research has great potential in providing potent antimicrobial agents that benefit patients."
"9392493","Project Summary / Abstract My proposed research and training program aims to improve the mobility and quality of life of veterans with transtibial (TT) amputation through the development of a novel biarticular prosthesis, and to train me in neuromuscular biomechanics, prosthetic engineering, and gait simulations through the guidance and support of a strong multidisciplinary team of mentors, so that I can become a successful independent research scientist. My long-term career goal is to design, develop and evaluate novel prosthetic, orthotic and assistive devices for people with reduced mobility. Consistent with this goal, I am proposing to design, develop and evaluate a novel biarticular prosthesis that addresses some of the limitations of current lower limb prostheses. Approximately one million people in the US are living with lower limb loss. An important cause of mobility impairment in this population is the loss of the ankle plantar flexors since these muscles are the primary contributors to body support, forward propulsion and swing leg initiation during normal walking. The biarticular gastrocnemius (GAS) has a role distinct from that of the soleus; it provides the dominant source of energy to power the leg into swing phase. Without the GAS, compensatory changes of the remaining leg muscles are necessary, including an increase in the concentric iliopsoas force to accelerate the leg into swing phase. Current prosthetic limbs cannot replicate the physiologic function of the ankle plantar flexors. When walking with conventional prosthetic foot-ankle systems, TT amputees show limited push-off power, and they use adaptive gait strategies, such as increased hip flexor work on the prosthetic side during pre-swing, to compensate for the lack of a biarticular GAS. These compensations are thought to contribute to the increased metabolic cost of amputee walking. To reduce the gait compensations typical of TT amputees, I am proposing to develop a novel biarticular prosthesis (BP) with a clutched spring that spans the ankle and knee joint. The BP will have the ability to generate net positive ankle joint work and to provide energy to power the leg into swing. I will use musculoskeletal modeling and simulations of TT amputee gait to optimize the design of the BP, and I will use gait analysis to evaluate the effect of the BP on gait. The BP has the potential to reduce gait compensations and improve functional mobility in veterans with TT amputation. The proposal has three specific aims: Aim 1: Using simulation, determine subject-specific optimal BP parameters. Aim 2: Demonstrate that the TT amputee gait compensations typically seen with conventional passive- elastic prostheses are reduced with the subject-specific optimal BP across a range of walking speeds. Aim 3: Determine if the Optimal BP reduces the metabolic cost of walking. To accelerate my training and facilitate my development into an independent research scientist, I have brought together mentors with diverse expertise. Dr. Czerniecki is a VA physiatrist and professor of rehabilitation medicine specializing in amputee rehabilitation and gait analysis. Dr. Klute is a VA research career scientist with a vibrant research program focused on prosthetic engineering and amputee mobility. Dr. Thelen is a professor of mechanical and biomechanical engineering and an expert in computational simulations of gait. Dr. Steele is an assistant professor of mechanical engineering and an OpenSim fellow with detailed knowledge or musculoskeletal modeling. Conducting the proposed research project and training program under the guidance of these mentors will allow me to become an expert in the neuromuscular biomechanics of gait, prosthetic engineering, and computational simulations of gait and to establish an independent research career."
"9386075","Project Summary  Chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis (CMC) is characterized by recurrent disease of the nails, skin, and oral and genital mucosae, caused by the fungus Candida albicans. The pathogenesis of CMC disease (CMCD), a genetic form of CMC, has long remained elusive. Our identification of autosomal recessive (AR) IL-17RA and autosomal dominant (AD) IL-17F deficiencies paved the way for that of AR IL-17RC and ACT1 deficiencies in other patients with isolated CMCD, and of AR ROR-? deficiency and AD STAT1 gain-of-function (GOF) in patients with a broader phenotype of syndromic CMCD. We showed that cells from patients with IL-17RA, IL- 17RC, and ACT1 deficiencies did not respond to IL-17A/F. In addition, IL-17RA- and ACT1-, unlike IL-17RC- deficient cells, did not respond to IL-17E. Moreover, patients with ROR-? deficiency and STAT1 GOF displayed low proportions of IL-17A/F-producing T cells, both ex vivo and after in vitro differentiation. We have reported 85 patients with a genetic etiology of CMCD, out of a total of 188 published cases. We have also enrolled 317 other patients with isolated or syndromic CMCD, from 245 kindreds, originating from 30 countries, whom we hypothesize carry CMCD-causing mutations. We intend to search for mutations in the six known CMCD-causing genes (IL17F, IL17RA, IL17RC, ACT1, RORC, and STAT1), in order to delineate the associated molecular, cellular, immunological, and clinical phenotypes. We also intend to pursue our search for novel CMCD-causing genes using genome-wide (GW) approaches, based on GW linkage (GWL), and whole-exome or whole- genome sequencing (WES/WGS); we will prioritize mutations in genes that control the response to, or the production of, IL-17A/F. This program is built on our pioneering effort in the human genetic dissection of CMCD by cutting-edge genomic and immunological methods, some of which have been developed in the laboratory. We have recently obtained surprising and exciting preliminary results. We found 12, 3, and 121 new patients with IL-17RA, ACT1, and STAT1 mutations, respectively. We also identified three novel genetic etiologies. We discovered AD JNK1 deficiency in three patients from a kindred with syndromic CMCD, whose cells do not respond to IL-17A/F; this is the first inborn error of MAPK-dependent immunity. We also discovered AR c-REL and ZNF341 deficiencies in syndromic CMCD patients from one and two kindreds, respectively, whose cells do not produce IL-17A/F; c-REL is a member of the NF-?B family and ZNF341 is a completely novel protein. These preliminary data neatly illustrate the validity of our approaches, and the potential of our integrated research. Our project is highly innovative, yet supported by strong preliminary evidence. From a basic biological standpoint, this research will provide considerable and novel insights into the mechanisms of mucocutaneous immunity to fungi, including the role of IL-17 cytokines. This work will also shed light on the pathogenesis of CMCD, making it possible to provide molecular diagnoses for patients and genetic counseling for families. This new information will facilitate the use of IL-17 or other cytokines for the treatment of CMC, in addition to antifungal agents."
"9387370"," During the last 3 centuries and before, Vibrio cholerae (Vc), a Gram negative bacterium has plagued humans, causing 7 pandemics of the disease, cholera. Cholera in both epidemic and endemic form, features intracta- ble diarrhea and high mortality if not treated. Endemic cholera in Africa and the Haiti epidemic underscore the unresolved issue of how to control cholera. One short term cholera control approach is a universal vaccine. The main challenge of a universal cholera vaccine is to provide immunity quickly to the most susceptible co- hort: young children (2-5 years old). The consensus is that the current oral cholera vaccine (OCV) with its 42% protective efficacy for young children does not accomplish this. We will expand and improve our experimental conjugate cholera vaccine by introducing a new clinically relevant carrier. The current BSA carrier is not ap- propriate for human vaccines. The conjugates we developed contain a highly immunogenic form of acid- detoxified Inaba LPS (pmLPS) that induces vibriocidal titers with one dose and highly protective Ab with a sec- ond. We need to optimize the pmLPS conjugate to reach our goal of a one dose cholera vaccine for young children. Individual Vc flagellar proteins (FlaPr) will serve as carriers. Synthesis of existing data in the cholera literature suggest a hypothesis: a purified, recombinant, Vc FlaPr will induce protective antibodies (Abs) and also serve as a TLR5 agonists required for optimal Ab induction. The literature indicates the two pro- tective Ag in pm-LPS-FlaPr conjugates will prompt synergistic Ab effects thus providing the final component of a one dose, pediatric cholera vaccine. Following oral or intranasal administration, FlaPr-based vaccine and a killed, whole-cell Vc vaccine will be compared for immunogenicity, induction of protective immunity, and B cell memory. Adult mice will serve for initial immunogenicity studies but in select studies, the vaccine response of neonatal mice will be compared to adults. Like young children, neonatal mice immunized with native LPS are poor repsonders. We propose to overcome this defect by using a conjugate vaccine that preferentially target neonatal follicular B cells rather than marginal zone B cells that mainly make anti-LPS IgM Abs. The redirected response should enhance class switching and induce LPS-specific memory B cells. In our studies, if adult and neonatal mice produce similar Ab responses to the conjugates, but only adults respond to the LPS, it would supply a critical piece of evidence showing the value of the conjugates and the utility of the neonatal mouse model. The use of pmLPS-FlaPr conjugates to overcome non-responsiveness to LPS epitopes in neonatal mice is decidedly novel for cholera vaccine research. In the clinic, capsular polysaccharides are the typical pro- tective epitopes of the conjugate vaccine that are used extensively for childhood vaccination (e.g., pneumo- coccal). Capsular conjugate vaccines are so effective they have reconfigured the circulating serotypes of childhood pathogens. pmLPS-conjugates could have the same effect."
"9382852","Project Summary/Abstract Using the pneumococcus as a model, our lab has revealed many features of the biochemical basis of the inflammatory response to bacteria in the brain. How the pneumococcus traffics across the blood brain barrier is shared by other meningeal pathogens. We determined how neurons die by apoptosis during infection and revealed the role of cell wall/TLR2 in host damage. The important discovery of this application is the opening of a new area of pathogenesis at the maternal/fetal interface that will inform new aspects of cell wall/TLR2 effects in the brain. We have determined that cell wall, a universal pathogen associated molecular pattern, circulates in the bloodstream of pregnant mice and traverses the placenta to the fetal brain. The response of fetal neurons is not the well characterized inflammation and neuronal death of the postnatal setting but the exact opposite: neuroproliferation without inflammation. This response involves two new activities of cell wall: 1) induction of cell proliferation without inflammatory signaling via TLR2, and 2) remodeling of embryonic brain anatomy and changes in postnatal behavior. An understanding of the details of this new biology, to be investigated in this application, represents both novel bacterial pathogenesis and an avenue of high potential for tangible medical impact.  We propose in Aim 1 to undertake detailed neuroanatomical assessment of the changes in brain architecture and define the window of neuroproliferation in embryogenesis. In Aim 2 we will characterize the signaling cascades initiated by cell wall to induce neuroproliferation, including via TLR2 and novel sources of PI3 kinase and induction of the neuronal transcription factor FoxG1. This will link innate immune receptors to nuclear transcription factors for the first time. Aim 3 will determine how cell wall released during the treatment of maternal sepsis recapitulates the neuroproliferation seen in the model of prenatal IV cell wall exposure of the mother. We will define the consequences to postnatal behavior of prenatal neuroproliferation."
"9379449","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Neutralizing antibody responses to influenza infection and vaccination is highly variable in the population which can be explained by differences in health status, exposure history, and polymorphism of immune response genes. Since protection is also correlated with neutralizing antibody titers, any role that immunoglobulin germline gene polymorphism may play in this variability is important to establish, but has been difficult to investigate due to the use of numerous V, D and J genes in the genesis of immunoglobulins and the enormous combinatorial diversity that results from the pairing of rearranged VH and VL genes. However, the discovery of biased usage of the IGHV1-69 germline gene in antibodies targeting the stem domain of (HA) hemagglutinin (HV1-69-sBnAbs) has provided a unique opportunity to investigate any biological role that IGHV1-69 germline gene polymorphism might have in the anti-influenza antibody response. Importantly, HV1-69-sBnAbs mostly originate from the IGHV1-69 51p1 allele-like group that encodes a conserved CDR-H2 Phe54 that serves as major anchor residue with HA. Here we present an association analysis between IGHV1-69 polymorphism and the frequency of stem reactive Abs by using blood samples and clinical data obtained from an NIH H5VN04 vaccine trial. Our data shows a remarkable effect of IGHV1-69 locus polymorphism on the serum BnAb titers to the HA stem. Analyses of their expressed Ab repertoires have also provided evidence that copy number variation (CNV) also impacts IgM HV1-69-sBnAb responses. Results of heat map analysis show that there may be a shift in global IGHV germline gene usage in individuals based on the IGVH1-69 genotype. We propose that underlying genetic variation within the human IGHV1-69 locus might explain a significant fraction of inter- individual variation to influenza vaccination. Here we plan to enroll a cohort o 100 adult healthcare workers to participate in a study to examine the effects of IGHV1-69 polymorphism in shaping the BnAb response to seasonal influenza vaccination. Three blood specimens will be obtained from each subject, pre-vaccination, day 7 post vaccination (plasmablast peak) and at 32-56 days post-vaccination (memory B cell pool). In Aim 1 pre vaccination blood samples will be used to study the role IGHV1-69 locus polymorphism in shaping global IGHV germline gene utilization and in establishing the anti-influenza BnAb memory B cell pool. Genotyping will be by SNP and copy number variation (CNV) and phenotyping by serologic MN, HAI, HA binding studies, anti- HA single B cell cloning and antibodyome analysis. In Aim 2 heterogeneity at the IGHV1-69 locus will effect global germline gene utilization in the BnAb response to seasonal influenza vaccination. We propose that there is a direct genotypic-phenotypic relationship at the IGHV1-69 locus with regard to an individual's capacity to mount an anti-influenza BnAb response. This study is designed to provide the first evidence of this linkage. This new information on the role of IGHV polymorphism in influenza immunity can be used translationally to predict and monitor vaccine responses and to design vaccines to achieve universal responsiveness."
"9384762","PROJECT SUMMARY Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2 (CMT2) is a severely debilitating axonopathic peripheral neuropathy, characterized by neuromuscular junction (NMJ) breakdown, axonal transport defects, and neuronal structure malformations. Although animal models for this condition are available, the wide array of gene mutations known to cause a CMT2 phenotype (>30 identified to date) makes the study of common pathway deficits problematic. This in turn makes identification of suitable therapeutic targets, capable of treating a wide range of patients, extremely difficult. The successful generation of human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived motor neurons from patients with CMT2 makes the establishment of patient-specific humanized assays for studying disease etiology a tangible goal. However, the ability to effectively model CMT2 in vitro using such cells has yet to be achieved, due to the complexity associated with generating robust and functionally mature NMJs in culture. We posit that a culture platform integrating correct tissue-level structural organization, physiologically relevant cell densities, and correct electromechanical conditioning stimuli will promote the development of human myotube-motor neuron co-cultures capable of supporting mature synapse formation. Using our well-established nanopatterned cell sheet manipulation techniques, we will generate scaffold-free 3D tissue structures using hiPSC-derived motor neurons and primary human myoblasts with highly ordered tissue structures. These constructs will be assessed for their ability to promote NMJ formation, and electromechanical conditioning will then be investigated as a means to drive synapse development. This system will be developed in conjunction with motor neurons derived from four CMT2 patients. Co-culture constructs incorporating these cells will be investigated for their capacity to accurately model the disease?s pathophysiology in vitro, and to highlight phenotypic similarities across different mutant lines. Given the prominent role of mitochondria in NMJ development, and the observed breakdown in axonal transport in multiple CMT2-related mutations, we hypothesize that reduced mitochondrial density in presynaptic terminals leads to malformations in NMJ development and ultimately breakdown of the synapse. We will use our CMT2 hiPSC-motor neurons to evaluate axon transport deficits and structural malformations in these cells and correlate these findings with quantified changes in NMJ development within our bioengineered co-culture platform. Finally, we will investigate whether improvement in axon transport properties in multiple CMT2 neuron lines (via stabilization of axonal development with histone deacetylase 6 inhibitors) results in significant improvements in NMJ development and stability in human cells. Consistency of results across different patient mutations will highlight axonal transport deficits as a major causal factor in the development of the human CMT2 phenotype, and validate our platform as a suitable tool for use in the preclinical assessment of new drugs designed to ameliorate peripheral neuropathic conditions."
"9395841","PROJECT SUMMARY The objective of the proposed research is to understand the functional role of Eph receptor clustering and signal transduction on neural stem cell function, harnessing a biomimetic strategy based on engineering synthetic multivalent ligands to modulate receptor complex formation. Cellular signal transduction often initiates with the multivalent interactions of ligands, either secreted or cell surface bound, to target cell receptors, leading to receptor clustering. Multivalent binding between ephrin and Eph receptors, which induces Eph clustering, has been found to play major roles in neurogenesis, immunology as well as the progression of cancer. However, current knowledge of the functional relationships between receptor clustering and signal activation, including how the latter depends on the number and spatial organization of receptors in a cluster, is limited. It was recently discovered that the interaction between EphB4 and eprhin-B2 regulates the neuronal differentiation of adult neural stem cells in the brain. Using this model system, I propose to engineer a series of novel multivalent EphB4 binding ligands to control the number, size, and nanoscale spatial organization of EphB4 receptors in a cluster. With this synthetic tool, I will investigate relationships between cluster properties, downstream signaling, and ultimately cell differentiation. Furthermore, the multivalent ligands that I will synthesize will serve as valuable reagents for elucidation of downstream signaling mechanisms. This work will have important implications for Eph signaling in many systems ? including neuroscience, immunology, and cancer biology ? as well as other receptor-ligand systems where oligomerization is critical for signaling."
"9379852","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term objective of this work is to develop effective treatments for the common sporadic form of Parkinson's disease (PD) by elucidating pathogenic mechanisms, thereby facilitating identification of neuroprotective interventions. PD is characterized by degeneration of groups of neurons in the central, autonomic and enteric nervous systems with formation of eosinophilic intracellular inclusion, Lewy bodies, in surviving neurons; the prominent motor symptoms of PD are attributable to severe loss of substantia nigra dopaminergic neurons. Convergent genetic, biochemical and pathological evidence implicates (i) alpha-synuclein, a presynaptic protein and a major component of Lewy bodies, and (ii) abnormalities of mitochondrial function, oxidative stress and resulting oxidative damage, in pathogenesis. In preliminary studies, we showed that these factors are mechanistically interdependent. Chronic exposure of rats to rotenone, a pesticide that is epidemiologically linked to PD, causes systemic mitochondrial complex I inhibition, resulting in specific neuropathology closely resembling PD (including alpha-synuclein aggregate formation). Abrogation of alpha-synuclein gene expression in the substantia nigra of rats prevented neurodegeneration, demonstrating that the PD-like neuropathology resulting from this etiologically-relevant environmental trigger is dependent on endogenous alpha-synuclein. Interactions between alpha-synuclein and mitochondria have been suggested previously, but the mechanisms whereby alpha-synuclein is necessary for susceptibility of dopamine neurons to etiologically-relevant mitochondrial toxins in vivo are not known. In order to address this question, we will employ a range of innovative models and tools, including: viral vectors that abrogate SNCA expression in vivo; transgenic zebrafish models in which neurodegeneration triggered by mitochondrial toxins is dependent on human alpha-synuclein; and novel transgenic zebrafish lines that express fluorescent reporters, allowing detection of dynamic changes in reactive oxygen species, glutathione oxidation, ATP levels, and mitochondrial fission, fusion and transport, in live dopamine neurons in vivo. Using these unique tools, we will determine how alpha- synuclein affects ROS production and oxidative stress (aim 1), cellular respiration and bioenergetics (aim 2) and mitochondrial dynamics (aim 3) following exposure to mitochondrial toxins implicated in PD pathogenesis, in mammalian and zebrafish dopamine neurons in vivo. In aim 4, we will exploit automated behavioral measurements in zebrafish larvae housed in 96-well plates to discover small molecule modifiers of alpha-synuclein-dependent toxicity of mitochondrial inhibitors in dopamine neurons. These data will elucidate the mechanisms underlying alpha-synuclein-dependent degeneration of dopamine neurons in response to mitochondrial toxins implicated in PD pathogenesis. The unique array of model systems and the team of investigators will enable us to understand the mechanistic link between the two most prominent pathological abnormalities in sporadic PD and thereby address a critical roadblock in the development of PD therapeutics."
