"9278780","In this renewal application, we will build on the successes of the past project period to further examine the biological, social, and economic conditions that shape health in the aging population of South Africa. Our program, Health and Aging in Africa: Longitudinal Studies of an INDEPTH Community (HAALSI) completed its initial 3-year grant period with the establishment of a community-based cohort with baseline data for 5,059 men and women ?40 years of age in the International Network for the Demographic Evaluation of Populations and Their Health in Developing Countries (INDEPTH) community of Agincourt, South Africa. The response rate to the baseline survey was 86%. We use the infrastructure and tools already in place for follow- up surveillance of the HAALSI cohort, and we anticipate very minimal loss to follow-up for data collection moving forward. We propose to conduct two waves of follow-up data collection at three-year intervals, allowing the longitudinal analysis of three waves of data collection and six years of follow-up for morbidity, mortality, biological, behavioral, and environmental risk factors, and physical and cognitive function. The proposed HAALSI Program includes five projects: Project 1: Alzheimer?s Disease and Related Dementias and Cognitive Impairment; Project 2: Cardiometabolic Disease in an Aging South African Cohort; Project 3: HIV and HIV Interventions to Promote Healthy Aging; Project 4: Public Policies to Improve Healthy Aging; and Project 5: Multimorbidity. The projects will be supported by four cores: Leadership and Administration (Core A), Field (Core B), Data Management and Analysis (Core C), Biomarkers and Biobanking (Core D). Each of these projects and cores will be led by investigators from both the U.S. and South Africa. All projects will share a common household and participant survey and assessment and have aims that are tightly integrated across projects to create a synergistic and dynamic program. The study design used by the HAALSI Program is finely tuned to capture characteristics specific to South Africa as well as harmonize with other HRS sister studies in India, China, Brazil, the UK, Europe, and the U.S., providing a unique opportunity to conduct cross-country comparisons of the biological, social, and economic determinants of chronic diseases and their effects on functional and health outcomes in aging populations. Such cross-country harmonized comparisons will enable scientists to identify new risk factors and understand the impact of known risk factors on a global scale. Our study will inform the current debate about whether ?standard? risk factors in highly industrialized Western countries have the same effects on health outcomes in non-Western, low income countries. Our study sets out to identify and examine the distribution of both novel and established risk factors for chronic health conditions and conduct a follow-up study to discover the predictive value of the identified biological, social, and environmental risk factors. We have built a strong set of experimental aims into this application focusing on the evaluation of public policies aimed at reducing health risks, which has direct relevance to health in the U.S."
"9278783","Core C: Data Management and Analysis Core?Abstract  Valid, reliable, and comparable information on the health of populations, including non-fatal outcomes, is an essential requirement for effective public health programs. The Health and Aging in Africa: Longitudinal Studies of an INDEPTH Community (HAALSI) Program is the only Health and Retirement Survey (HRS) sister study in Africa and fills a gap by providing information on a cohort of older adults within a Health and Demographic Surveillance Site (HDSS), in the context of high HIV prevalence and rising risks and prevalence of cardiometabolic diseases (CMD). The five projects in HAALSI share a need to collect valid, reliable, and comparable measurements on a wide array of variables of interest; to characterize trends over time in selected outcomes; and to undertake rigorous analysis of key relationships between variables, including evaluation of causal effects where relevant and feasible. In addition to its position as the only HRS sister study in sub- Saharan Africa, the specific research aims of the HAALSI Program reside within a broader INDEPTH initiative to advance the understanding of adult health and aging across the network, which adds further salience to the need to develop durable measurement and analytic procedures, techniques, and instruments for illuminating patterns and trends in the health and well-being of older adults. The overall goal of the Data Management and Analysis Core (Core C) is to serve as a fundamental resource to all of the projects, the investigative team, and the scientific community via a set of key functions including: developing and disseminating a harmonized set of measurement instruments; developing the analytic basis for instrument testing and validation in close collaboration with the Field Core (Core B); and providing a focal point and toolkit for standardized data analysis and synthesis of research findings, in a way that maximizes use of new and existing data sources. Core C will also work closely with the Leadership and Administration Core (Core A) on large-scale dissemination activities and with the Biomarkers and Biobanking Core (Core D) on harmonization and standardization of biomarker data incorporation into analytical datasets for wide public use. The aims for Core C are:  AIM 1: Develop and adapt a comprehensive set of instruments and protocols for valid, reliable, and  comparable measurement of functional health status, morbidity, risk factor exposures, and economic and  social covariates of health.  AIM 2: Develop summary measures, derive variables for analytic datasets, harmonize standardized  variables across HRS and sister studies, and support applications of analytical strategies that will be  coordinated and shared across projects and cores.  AIM 3: Fully document HAALSI datasets for public use and harmonize HAALSI data collection throughout  waves and across HRS sister studies."
"9492877","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Emerging evidence demonstrates that Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) can be reliably diagnosed by age two, and that early identification and intervention can improve outcomes. Low-income and minority children with ASD, however, are diagnosed later and experience greater delays in service provision than their white and more financially advantaged peers. Feasible, culturally appropriate interventions with broad scale-up potential are necessary to reduce this disparity. This R01 application builds upon pilot studies (Augustyn, HRSA R40 MC19928; Feinberg, AHRQ R03 HS22155) of an adapted version of Patient Navigation as means to reduce disparities in ASD diagnosis and service provision. Patient Navigation is a lay-delivered case management approach that focuses on overcoming logistical hurdles to care during a defined episode. Pilot data from our research group demonstrate the feasibility of an adapted approach of Patient Navigation, referred to as Family Navigation (FN), among families of children with suspected ASD, and provide suggestive evidence that the approach both reduces time to ASD diagnosis and increases engagement with services. We propose a multisite, randomized comparative effectiveness trial (n=19,500) of a systemic, lay-delivered FN protocol, which begins prior to a child's 18 or 24 month health supervision visit and ends 100 days after an ASD diagnosis is made. The trial takes place in urban, integrated care networks that provide healthcare to low-income children. The basic structure of both intervention arms is a collaborative care system. The conventional care management arm (CCM) is consistent with the type of care provided within a traditional - but high quality - medical home. The FN arm provides more intensive, individually tailored, care coordination and theory-based family support. Children will be followed for 12 months. Data regarding screening outcomes, diagnosis and service utilization will be abstracted from children's medical records. Measures of parental stress, self-management skills, caregiver burden, and satisfaction with services will be administered over 4 collection time points, linked to key intervention outcomes. We will assess the superiority of FN as compared to CCM as a means to: achieve an 80% screening rate for indicators of ASD across all sites; implement a decision rule for referral to ASD evaluation; shorten the time to diagnosis among children suspected to have ASD; shorten the time to deployment of ASD services among those diagnosed; and improve engagement with ASD services. Our lay-delivered FN system has been designed to have broad scale-up potential. Thus, to provide critical information on how such a system could be best implemented and disseminated across urban primary care settings nationwide, we will conduct a concurrent implementation analysis - systematically examining performance gaps in FN's delivery according to the Theoretical Domains Framework. If successful, our study will provide real world primary care practices with a replicable model of care that increases early identification and access to timely diagnostic and early intervention services for a vulnerable population of urban families."
"9591997","Diabetes mellitus is characterized by impaired glucose homeostasis resulting from insufficiency or functional failure of insulin-producing ??cells, alone or in association with insulin resistance. Therefore, restoring ?-cell mass and function is essential to reverse the development of diabetes. Utilizing small molecule inducers of ?-cell proliferation is a particularly promising strategy with numerous valuable features such as their oral bioavailability and target specificity. However, the slow rate of ?-cell proliferation in adult humans is a major hurdle to overcome to use this approach. Through a chemical genetic screen for small molecule enhancers of ?-cell regeneration in zebrafish, we identified several TBK1/IKK? inhibitors (TBK1/IKK?-Is). TBK1/IKK?-Is promoted ?-cell regeneration by markedly increasing proliferation of ?-cells. Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor rapamycin eliminated the effect of TBK1/IKK?-Is on regenerating ?-cells, whereas TBK1/IKK?-Is augmented mTOR activity. Interestingly, treatment with TBK1/IKK?-Is led to pronounced increase in cAMP levels. The proliferation effect of TBK1/IKK?-Is was verified in primary mammalian islets including human islets. The goal of this application is to delineate the mechanisms and the strategies of how to increase functional ?-cell mass with suppression of TBK1/IKK?. First, we will design and investigate the potency of novel TBK1/IKK?-Is on ?-cell regeneration. Using (E)-3-(3-phenylbenzo[c]isoxazol-5-yl)acrylic acid (abbreviated as PIAA), which markedly increases ?-cell regeneration, as a lead compound, we will perform structure-activity relationship (SAR) analyses of TBK1/IKK?-PIAA interaction. Furthermore, we will use the PIAA as a scaffold to design new molecular architectures that exhibit potent and selective TBK1/IKK? inhibition activities with minimum toxicity on ?-cell regeneration. Second, we will elucidate underlying mechanisms of TBK1/IKK?-mediated ?-cell regeneration. Given that rapamycin treatment abolished the effect of TBK1/IKK? suppression on ?-cell regeneration and TBK1/IKK?-Is enhanced mTOR activity and cAMP levels, we will test whether TBK1/IKK? suppression promotes ?-cell regeneration via modulating the cAMP-mTOR signaling cascade. We will perform biochemical and functional analyses to characterize the TBK1/IKK?-cAMP-mTOR interplay on ?-cell regeneration in vitro and in vivo. Third, we will investigate the efficacy of TBK1/IKK?-Is on expanding functional ?-cell mass in mammalian systems. We will use primary pancreatic islets to examine the potency of PIAA and its newly synthesized analogs on ?-cell replication. Furthermore, we will evaluate the ability of PIAA and its analogs to promote ?-cell expansion and enhance glycemic control in mice including a mouse model of streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetes."
"9430921","Project Summary This application for a Mentored Research Scientist Development Award (K01) is designed to advance knowledge important for lessening the expression of functional disability in children with CP and support the career of Dr. Danielle Levac, BSc.PT, MSc, PhD, an assistant professor in the Department of Physical Therapy, Movement and Rehabilitation Science at Northeastern University. Dr. Levac directs the Rehabilitation Games and Virtual Reality Lab where the proposed research will take place. Dr. Levac?s proposed research is based on her experience evaluating how typically developing children and children with cerebral palsy (CP), the most common cause of pediatric disability, acquire new skills through interaction with motion-controlled virtual reality games displayed in two-dimensional (2D), flat-screen virtual environments. This common approach to rehabilitation suffers from poor transfer of skill improvement to real world situations. Dr. Levac aims to investigate the mechanisms underlying this major treatment drawback by exploring whether virtual environments that promote adaptive variability in movement patterns in children with CP will enhance transfer to a real-life skill. Her preliminary studies provide evidence for this hypothesis. To explore these questions, she will first identify whether the amount of adaptive variability during skill acquisition is important for transfer success in children with CP (Specific Aim 1). Next, she will compare performance variability and transfer between 2D virtual environments and a novel 3D head-mounted display (HMD) environment (Specific Aim 2) to understand differential effects on movement variability and its relationship to skill acquisition and transfer to a real life task. Children?s performance and outcomes will be measured using motion capture methods. Dr. Levac has a clinical research background and will seek mentored training and skill development to enhance her knowledge about specific sensorimotor impairments in children with CP and their treatment, gain skills in motion capture methodology and statistical variability modeling, and support her continued fluency with virtual reality hardware and software given the predicted rapid developments in this field. She will accomplish these goals through a combination of formal coursework, mentored skill development, and the empirical research described above. Dr. Levac has recruited an interdisciplinary mentor and advisory committee to guide her in these research and training activities. This committee has senior-level expertise in sensorimotor control and learning in children with CP, motion capture methodology and data processing, statistical variability modeling and analysis , and virtual environment task design and interface technology. They are eminently qualified and fully committed to assisting Dr. Levac to further her training, research and career path and achieve her career objectives. With this training, Dr. Levac is poised to become a leading researcher in the ever-changing field of virtual environments for pediatric rehabilitation, producing research that is directly translatable to clinical practice and that enhances functional outcomes for children with CP and other neuromotor impairments."
"9590724","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Epilepsy represents a neurological disorder that can manifest in uncontrolled seizures in patients. Microglia are exquisitely sensitive to disruptions i the central nervous system. Since epilepsy is characterized by neuronal hyperactivity activity rooted in excessive glutamate release and ionic imbalance, it is conceivable that microglia may perform functions to reduce neuronal dysfunction and promote neuronal health during the pathology. In our preliminary studies, we have found that microglia respond by robust process extension making increasing contact with neurons during elevated glutamate levels in acute brain slices. Moreover, in three different models of epileptiform activity, microglial processes focus on neuronal dendrites and microglial ablation reduces behavioral seizure scores. Based on our preliminary results, we hypothesize that during increased glutamate levels hyperactive neurons signal to microglia inducing their process extension. Additionally, during hyperactive neuronal activity, microglial processes focus on neuronal elements with a consequence to downregulate such hyperactivity which is critical in limiting behavioral seizure outcome and promoting neuronal survival. We will now test this hypothesis along with the following specific aims. In Aim 1, we will determine the underlying mechanisms behind glutamate-induced microglial process extension elucidating the neuronal receptors initiating and the released chemoattractants mediating the process extension signal. In Aim 2, we will determine the targets of microglial process focus as well as the chemoattractants mediating the response in three models of epileptiform activity in acute brain slices. In Aim 3, we will extend our observations in acute brain slices to in vivo live brain and determine the role of microglia in epilepsy-induced seizure behaviors and neuronal cell death by microglial ablation and genetic deletion of the unique microglial P2Y12 receptor. These studies are the first to investigate the microglial dynamics during acute epilepsy. They will increase our understanding of the mechanisms underlying microglial-neuronal interactions during epileptic activity and the neuroprotective potential of microglia in epilepsy. In addition, the outcome of these studies will provide new data that could inform the development of novel therapies in the treatment of epileptic disorders."
"9586379","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Matrix remodeling and stromal-epithelial cellular communication contribute to aggressive progression of prostate cancer. Hyaluronan (HA), is a glycosaminoglycan polymer synthesized and turned over when appropriate for cell proliferation and motility. Normally, its levels are tightly controlled by HA synthase enzymes (HAS), hyaluronidases, and specific HA receptors such as the HA receptor for endocytosis (HARE). HA is negligible in normal adult prostate, but abundant in prostate tumors and bone metastases. Quantification of tumor cell associated HA and its turnover enzyme, Hyal1, predicts invasive progression and biochemical recurrence after resection. This proposal is focused on determining how the HA synthesis and turnover enzymes work together to influence matrix morphology and cell communication. The hypothesis is that surface HA borne by tumor cells increases metastatic efficiency by facilitating arrest in HARE-expressing vasculature and/or entry of the tumor cells into lymph and marrow tissue. In addition, excess tumor-borne HA may accelerate tumor cell endocytosis and/or endocytic recycling if Hyal1 is present, activating lymphatic remodeling. Rate of endocytic recycling determines the surface density of growth factor and adhesion receptors and thereby impacts tumor cell motility and metastatic survival. In aim 1, tumor cells selected for inducible HA synthesis or HA turnover will be used to test respective roles of these enzymes in clinically relevant mouse models of prostatic growth and bone metastasis. Pharmacological agents and in vivo knockdown will be used to examine how HARE functions in host target tissues to regulate prostate tumor cell colonization. These strategies will also determine how HA signaling and turnover may be therapeutically targeted to delay or prevent prostate cancer progression. Aim 2 will examine metastasis mechanisms by comparing the effects of tumor versus stromal components of HA metabolism and HA signaling on lymphatic vessel morphology, as well as lymph node and bone metastasis. The molecular format for delivery and propagation of the HA signals that trigger morphological changes to support metastasis will be characterized. Aim 3 will pursue the novel observation that elevated Hyal1, which is both a secreted and a lysosomal enzyme, increases the rate of endocytic recycling in the prostate tumor cells stably selected for its expression. The working hypothesis is that Hyal1 impacts several specific signaling pathways concurrently by modulating the rate of vesicular trafficking, thus contributing to tumor growth by maintaining surface presentation of important receptors and by re-externalizing biologically potent digestion products of HA that serve as signals. Its autocrine effects, as well as its impact on prostate stromal cells, will be tested."
"9434051","Project summary Late-life depression (LLD) is a common mental disorder in the elderly, with high prevalence rates ranging from 1 to 5% (Byers et al., 2010). Recent evidence suggest that LLD is linked to age-related negative health outcomes, such as cerebrovascular disease, increased risk of Alzheimer?s disease, vascular dementia, and mortality. The mechanisms of LLD are complex and involve the dysregulation of different biological pathways. Based on past research conducted in our group, we identified dysregulation of proteostasis control as a potential pathophysiologic mechanism of LLD. Loss of proteostasis control can play a significant role in neuronal and axonal dysfunction, revealed by diffusion-tensor imaging, in LLD. Based on preliminary data and the current literature, this study proposes to evaluate the association between a newly developed proteostasis control (PC) index, clinical phenotypes (severity of depressive symptoms and cognitive impairment), and microstructural white matter abnormalities in older adults with depression. Our hypotheses are that LLD individuals will show a significantly higher PC index (i.e. indicating a greater proteostasis dysregulation) compared to age- and gender-matched never-depressed control subjects. Also, PC dysregulation will be associated with greater cognitive impairment, and decreased fractional anisotropy and increased radial diffusivity in LLD. To our knowledge, this will be the first study to examine the association between circulating proteostasis markers, microstructural changes and clinical characteristics in LLD. By gaining a better understanding of the molecular basis of structural changes in LLD, we can identify novel therapeutic targets and critical periods for intervention to treat depression in older adults."

"9423764","Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a disabling early-onset neuropsychiatric disorder with unclear underlying pathophysiology, which has hindered the development of new treatments and interventions. While there is a clear genetic contribution to OCD risk, decades of investigations have yet to yield reproducible, statistically significant findings that have identified high-confidence risk genes. Progress in leveraging genetics to clarify biology has likely been impeded by multiple factors, including a narrow focus on common genetic variants with small effect sizes, underpowered study designs, general uncertainty about the spectrum of genetic variation that should be queried, and limited attention to downstream gene expression and associated epigenetic signatures that drive gene expression in relevant tissue. There is a critical need for further efforts using alternate approaches to identify and confirm risk genes that will provide insights into OCD biology. The overall objective of the current proposal is to use high-throughput sequencing approaches to identify OCD risk genes, detect gene expression differences in OCD, and determine epigenetic signatures driving gene expression in OCD brain. This will be accomplished by pursuing three specific aims. Aim 1 proposes to (a) identify high-confidence risk genes by whole-exome sequencing and de novo genetic variant detection in 500 OCD parent-child trios and 500 control trios; (b) replicate these analyses with collaborator data from 475 OCD trios and 1,000 OCD probands; and (c) integrate OCD risk genes into systems analyses to identify enriched gene networks, pathways, and spatiotemporal expression patterns. Aim 2 proposes to identify somatic mosaic variants in exome sequencing data from all OCD and control trios, and from peripheral blood and brain tissue from 10 OCD subjects. Aim 3 proposes identification of differentially expressed genes and chromatin signatures in brain tissue from 10 OCD and 10 matched control subjects using RNA-seq, ChIP-seq, and ATAC-seq. The proposed research attempts to close gaps in our knowledge of OCD biology by a series of studies that specifically addresses Objective 1 of the NIMH Strategic Plan (defining the mechanisms of complex behaviors). If successful, this research will transform our understanding of the underlying mechanisms of OCD and identify points of traction for mechanistic studies in model systems, ultimately leading to novel therapeutics, and reducing the significant morbidity and mortality associated with this disabling illness. Furthermore, insights gained in these studies can inform gene discovery approaches to other complex neuropsychiatric disorders."
"9278785","Project 1 Abstract  The burden of age-related dementias, including Alzheimer?s disease and related dementias (ADRD), remains understudied in much of Africa, with a few notable exceptions.1-4 By 2040, an estimated 70% of the 80 million people with dementia globally will reside in low and middle income countries.5 Dementia is a particular issue for these countries, such as South Africa, where life expectancies are expected to rise dramatically.6-9 7-9 Within virtually all countries, cognitive decline has shown strong disparities with household income and educational attainment.10, 11 South Africa is no exception and the associations with low levels of education and lifelong disadvantage are substantial. Our long-term goal is to understand the epidemiologic patterns and projected public health burden of ADRD in South Africa, as well as to identify factors that either reduce or increase ADRD risk. With this renewal application for the Health and Aging in Africa: Longitudinal Studies of an INDEPTH Community (HAALSI) Program, we propose to take a major step towards this goal by conducting longitudinal cognitive and dementia-related assessments in HAALSI , a population-based community cohort of adults ?40 years of age. Project 1 is integrated with Projects 2 (Cardiometabolic Disease) and 3 (HIV) to optimize goals. We have cognitive measures harmonized with the Health and Retirement Study and sister studies for the HAALSI cohort of 5,059 adults ?40 years of age. We propose the following aims: AIM 1: Obtain information on the incidence and prevalence of ADRD as well as mild cognitive impairment (MCI). By year 05, we will have three cognitive assessments over three waves with six years of longitudinal information on cognitive function, mortality follow-up and clinical and informant assessments. These data will permit us to (1A) identify rates of all-cause dementia and MCI; and (1B) evaluate impacts of vascular conditions and HIV on all-cause dementia and MCI and calculate attributable risk. To accomplish this, we will use information from our neuropsychological batteries, clinical examination, and biomarkers of risk related to HIV, antiretroviral therapy (ART), and vascular disorders. AIM 2: Identify social and economic risk and resilience factors affecting cognitive decline and ADRD. We hypothesize that educational attainment and social networks help older adults maintain high cognitive functioning as they age (cognitive reserve).12-16 We determine whether social engagement drawn from network structures protects against decline.12, 17-24 We examine moderating conditions related to gender and age. AIM 3: Evaluate associations of Apoliprotein E (APOE) and markers of biological aging related to telomeres with cognitive decline and ADRD. In a subsample of 2,000 we will investigate the role of these genetic markers and ADRD and identify risks and interactions with educational attainment and ADRD."
"9590281","ABSTRACT  The form that organs acquire during development is critical for their functionality. For example, failed tissue  looping during heart development results in congenital heart disease -­ the most common birth defect observed  in humans. While many studies have identified how cells are fated to perform their tasks, we know little about the forces that shape tissues. Transcription factors (TFs) spanning multiple length scales - ranging from a few to hundreds of cells - precisely regulate gene expression programs. These programs generate the physical stresses that give rise to cell behavior. To ensure that organs take on their proper shape vital for their function, physical stresses must be coordinated across tissues spanning multiple length scales. We are beginning to understand how short-ranged TFs control physical stresses at the level of individual cells. This proposal seeks to uncover how tissues are shaped by physical stresses, controlled at the organ scale, using D. melanogaster as a model system. Novel methods for in toto live imaging and tissue cartography have revealed: cell behavior is modulated along the dorsoventral (DV) axis during germband extension. DV behavior modulation is lost in dorsalizing mutants. These findings challenge the assumption, that long-range TFs, such as Dorsal, act only indirectly by setting up short-range patterns to control stress. To test the hypothesis that long-range TFs modulate physical stresses responsible for organ shape, we propose: Aim 1 to measure physical stress at the organ scale, and by systematic comparison to known TF expression patterns, identify the role of Dorsal in organ scale stress coordination. In aim 2 we will extend our observations to investigate coordination of cell behavior across heterologous tissue layers during midgut looping. The proposed research combines quantitative experiments with theory, to provide the first strategy for measuring TF mediated global stress coordination that shapes organs. State of the art microscopes and tools designed for analyzing cell behaviors that produce complex shapes will open new opportunities for understanding how intricate organs form, including loops.  "
"9536331","Summary Hip fractures are the most devastating result of osteoporosis and often the first step in a downward spiral of lost ambulation and independence, institutionalization, and secondary medical morbidity and mortality. Within one year of hip fracture, 50% of patients will be unable to walk without assistance, 25% will require long-term care, and 20% will have died. One potent regulator of bone formation is physical loading (Krahl et al. 1994); however, the cellular sensing mechanism directing mechanotransduction has proven to be elusive. Our laboratory is one of the first to demonstrate that the osteocyte primary cilium plays a major role in this process (Malone et al. 2007). The primary cilium is a solitary cellular extension present in virtually every cell in the body, but its function has yet to be fully characterized. As osteocyte mechanosensors, these organelles act synergistically with other known regulators of bone metabolism. Our contribution is to elucidate the primary cilium microdomain?s role in osteocyte mechanotransduction and identify the intracellular signaling mechanisms involved. This contribution is significant because it catalyzes a continuum of research leading to novel pharmacologic therapeutics that potentiate mechanical loading at a molecular level. The long-term goal of this project is to determine how primary cilia contribute to bone mechanosensing and capitalize on this knowledge to develop novel therapies. The overall objective of this application is to exploit the molecular mechanisms identified in the last funding period to sensitize osteocyte primary cilia and identify osteocyte-cilia specific therapeutic targets. We will achieve this objective by establishing the potential of osteocyte cilia therapeutics in vivo (SA1), enhancing osteocyte-specificity through molecular manipulation of the intraciliary signaling system (SA2), and ensuring that ciliary strategies do not have adverse effects on bone biology (SA3). At the conclusion of this project, we expect to contribute potential pharmacologic agents that target unique characteristics of the osteocyte microdomain to bias bone formation without adverse effects to normal physiology. Osteoporosis prevention will dramatically increase patient quality of life, reduce morbidity, and cut health care costs. A collateral benefit will be extending this knowledge to applications in other cell types to develop treatments for numerous cilia-associated diseases."
"9278782","Core B: Field Core?Abstract  The Health and Aging in Africa: Longitudinal Studies of an INDEPTH Community (HAALSI) Program aims to develop a unique platform for understanding patterns and trends in health and well-being of older adults by incorporating two new waves of longitudinal survey data with the HAALSI baseline and leveraging the strong existing infrastructure of routine demographic and health surveillance in Agincourt, South Africa. The principal goals of the Field Core (Core B) are to establish rigorous, standardized systems to support data collection, manage household surveys, follow all participants in the baseline survey, and integrate data on mortality and selected demographic information from the Agincourt Health and Demographic Surveillance System (HDSS). The survey will be the central source for new primary data essential for the analyses proposed in the five projects of the HAALSI Program, focused on Alzheimer?s disease and related dementias (ADRD), cardiometabolic disease (CMD), HIV, public policy, and multimorbidity. To meet these goals, Core B will develop and implement common systems of data collection, data capture and data management. Core B will coordinate pilot testing of all new data collection instruments and procedures and will produce final data collection tools through close collaboration with the Data Management and Analysis Core (Core C). Core B will work with the Agincourt HDSS team to create well-defined field procedures based on the HDSS routine surveillance and the experience gained collecting baseline data during in the previous funding period, to implement efficient field operations, and to ensure that data collection teams reach all participants in each survey wave. Core B will develop Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs), train all site-based personnel, and develop and implement appropriate quality assurance monitoring. Moreover, Core B will produce continuous progress reports that will be discussed with the PIs of all projects to ensure that corrections are implemented when necessary so that final data collected is complete and of highest quality. Finally, Core B will implement existing and newly created cohort maintenance systems to track the cohort of 5,059 individuals who participated in the HAALSI baseline data collection. These systems will allow for complete follow-up of the cohort; the identification, tracking and follow-up of migrants; and the registration of deaths soon after the event so that a verbal autopsy can be undertaken in a timely manner. The work in Core B will take advantage of the extensive experience of the Agincourt field team in implementing complex surveys of this nature."
"9379798","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Behavioral inhibition/social reticence (BI/RET) is one of the most stable dispositional characteristics reported in childhood. Early BI/RET is often reinforced and exacerbated by children's reciprocal interactions with parents across development. Importantly, stable BI/RET places young children at subsequent risk for diagnosable anxiety disorders (namely, social phobia) during adolescence and adulthood and this risk is moderated by (a) overly directive/controlling parenting and (b) the child' lack of socal and emotion-regulation skills. The purpose of the proposed project is to conduct and evaluate a full-scale, randomized controlled trial during which we will randomly assign 150 45-60 month old children and their parents to either the Turtle Program (combined adapted Parent Child Interaction Therapy and Social Skills Facilitated Play (PCIT and SSFP) or to a less intensive, 6-session parent psychoeducation group, the best available treatment for preschool BI. The Turtle Program components highlight the development of skills to intervene in the reciprocal cycle of parent-child and peer interactions that contribute to the development of anxiety. Importantly, the group- based nature of SSFP provides a social context in which parents can practice behavioral skills with their child while being coached by the therapists. This trial will examine mediators an moderators of treatment response. Outcome measures (collected at pre-treatment, mid-treatment, post-treatment, and one-year follow-up) will include parent and teacher ratings/questionnaires of child anxiety symptoms/disorders, temperament, and social functioning; observational measures of parenting and children's social behaviors in the classroom; and heart rate physiology (a biological index of emotional reactivity and regulation)."
"9379414","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Heat waves currently account for significant mortality and morbidity and climate change is resulting in more frequent, more intense, and longer heat waves. Developing effective prevention strategies for heat-related illness and morality is of critical importance. We hypothesize that significant differences in heat-related health risks exist between urban and rural communities. The research proposed here extends our initial work in developing community-engaged research in underserved urban and rural communities in Alabama. In it we propose to gather community-level and individual-level heat and air pollution exposure data in communities. This analysis will result in a more precise picture of exposures to heat and air pollution as well as behavioral factors that may medicate exposure in at-risk populations in the Deep South. We propose to do the following in the present study: 1) Build our current collaborations that bridge diverse research disciplines and local level government and community organizations in urban (Birmingham) and rural communities in the Black Belt region of Alabama through community advisory board meetings and capacity building workshops , 2) Measure community-level heat and air pollution exposure in urban and rural communities by setting up stationary monitoring sites where community members frequent, 3) Determine individual-level exposure by recruiting community members to wear personal monitors and 4) Identify behavioral and physiological parameters associated with personal exposure through daily activity logs and questionnaire. The proposed investigation will contribute to prevention research by identifying specific exposure and behavioral risk factors in urban versus rural communities which will aid in developing prevention strategies tailored to the needs of these communities. Spatially explicit vulnerability maps that apply remote sensing datasets will inform community prioritization and planning applicable to a broader geographical scale."
"9435222","Creatine deficiency syndrome (CDS) is caused by mutation of the X-linked creatine transporter, SLC6A8. Symptoms include intellectual disability, epilepsy, delayed speech/dysphasia, autistic behavioral disorders, delayed motor skills (walking, sitting), slow growth and individuals tire easily. Less often there are abnormal heart rhythms, microcephaly, midfacial hypoplasia and self-mutilation. The onset of symptoms occurs between 3-36 months of age, indicating a window of opportunity for maximal treatment benefit. CDS is the second most common X-linked intellectual disability after Fragile-X syndrome, estimated at 1% of all intellectual disabilities of unknown etiology, which approximates to at least 3.5 million males globally. As genetic testing improves the number of confirmed cases will likely rise significantly as under diagnosis in males is addressed. Currently, no treatment modality exists as creatine cannot cross the blood brain barrier or enter brain cells without a functioning transporter, making creatine supplementation ineffective. Importantly, it appears that brain cells do not have the ability to synthesis creatine, unlike the liver, pancreas and kidney. Creatine is an essential biochemical for ATP metabolism, acting as a phosphate sink in the form of phosphocreatine in brain tissues with fluctuating and dynamic energy demands. To rapidly test the creatine analogs we have synthesized, to identify candidate targets, there is a need for high throughput screening tools. Testing in whole animals is critical to demonstrate that analogs can pass through the blood brain barrier and enter complex neuronal tissues. Zebrafish are genetically tractable, available in large numbers and develop quickly external to the mother. Importantly, they have phenotypic and genetic similarities to humans, with similar organ systems to mammals and sharing significant genetic sequence identity to humans makes screening in zebrafish attractive. ZIRC has recently started to release the first of four KO zebrafish lines, one with an SLC6A8 null mutation and three KO lines of the paralog (currently designated as si:ch211-117c9.5, or SLC6A8b), which has 69% protein similarity to SLC6A8a (99% similarity of transmembrane domains). The purpose of this proposal is to further develop and validate these KO lines, cross breeding to incorporate all four SLC6A8 mutant alleles, and test the ability of our analogs to enter brain tissue in the double null mutants. To do this we propose the following three aims: Aim 1: Validate and further develop SLC6A8 KO lines, Aim 2: Screen for creatine analogs that can passively transport into brain tissue without the need for a functional creatine transporter, Aim 3: Analyze the morphology of GABAergic regions to identify changes in SLC6A8 embryos."
"9519455","Abstract Depression is a debilitating and recurring psychiatric disorder. Approximately half of the patients with depressive disorder fail to respond to currently available antidepressants. The long-term goal of this project is to understand the pathogenesis of depressive disorders and to develop new therapeutic approaches for this disease. This is a resubmission of the application for competitive renewal of our current funding to study the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying the antidepressant-like effect of the adipocytederived hormone, leptin. We have provided strong evidence that leptin possesses antidepressant-like properties, supporting a new adipostatic hypothesis of depression. Direct infusion of leptin into the hippocampus produces antidepressant- like effects, and ablation of the functional leptin receptor, LepRb, in this brain region induces depressive-like behaviors, suggesting an essential role of LepRb in the hippocampus in mediating leptin action on depressive behaviors. We have made novel observations that ablation of LepRb principally in forebrain glutamatergic neurons (Lepr cKO) leads to depressive-like symptoms and facilitates NMDA-induced synaptic depression in the hippocampus. The antidepressant-like behavioral effects of leptin were abolished in Lepr cKO mice. These mice were resistant to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) treatments but highly responsive to the glutamate receptor NMDANR2B (also termed GluN2B) antagonist. These findings led to the hypothesis that the glutamatergic system mediates leptin action on depressive behaviors. We propose to determine 1) the role of hippocampal glutamate neurotransmission in mediating the antidepressant-like effects of leptin, and 2) the contribution of remodeling of hippocampal dendritic spines, sites of glutamatergic synapses, to the antidepressant-like effects of leptin. These studies will generate novel insights into molecular and cellular mechanisms into leptin action in the limbic system and lead to the development of novel therapies for depression."
"9379799","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Muscle weakness is a major factor contributing to declines in functional mobility and is a strong predictor of mortality. Muscle weakness and wasting is also one of the most common pathologic clinical symptoms of environmental exposure to arsenic. However, the mechanisms and molecular pathogenesis in the etiology of arsenic-induced muscle morbidity is relatively unknown. In addition, although the contribution of arsenic exposure on stem cell function important for development has been increasingly investigated, there is an under-recognized need to know whether and how environmental toxicants like arsenic affect adult stem cell behavior and it is important to resolve how stem cell vulnerability to environmental contaminants affects the ability of otherwise healthy tissues to respond to acute injury. An enhanced understanding of the mechanisms underlying the clinical symptoms of skeletal muscle dysfunction is crucial for the design of strategies and policies to prevent or reduce injury. As a first step towards this end, the objective of this proposal is to investigate the impact and mechanisms of arsenic on pathogenic alterations of muscle function and regenerative capacity.  We find that low to moderate environmental exposure to arsenic in drinking water damages skeletal muscle by disrupting muscle composition and structure, as well as injuring mitochondria and altering mitochondrial bioenergetics. In addition to myofiber pathology, we find sustained alteration of adult muscle stem cell function, including an impaired differentiation, aberrant mitochondrial bioenergetics, and increased autophagy. Interestingly, this stem cell dysfunction induced by arsenic in vivo is sustained in isolated cells cultured over serial passages, even after the arsenic stimulus has been removed. The preliminary findings support investigation of our central hypothesis that lasting mitochondrial alterations stimulated by As(III) alter myofiber and MuSC bioenergetics to impair muscle maintenance and regenerative capacity. In Specific Aim 1, we will investigate whether commonly encountered arsenic exposures induce myofiber mitochondrial dysfunction and altered bioenergetics to decrease muscle development, maintenance, and exercise capacity. In Specific Aim 1, we will investigate whether direct arsenic effects on muscle stem cell bioenergetics and function result in decreased skeletal muscle regenerative potential. Success in these aims will increase our understanding of the pathogenesis of arsenic-induced losses in muscle maintenance and clinical symptoms of weakness and will elucidate skeletal muscle microenvironmental factors controlling stem cell declines. This will ultimately lead to future mechanistic investigations designed to improve functional outcomes in patients living in arsenic-endemic areas and to create prevention strategies."

"9483038","PROJECT ABSTRACT Despite widespread implementation of antiretroviral therapy (ART) that effectively suppresses virus replication in the periphery, HIV persists in tissue reservoirs and accounts for the rapid plasma viral rebound in HIV- infected individuals who have discontinued ART. It is well appreciated that secondary lymphoid tissues represent a drug-privileged site that account for residual viral persistence in HIV-infected individuals on ART. Hence, effective cure and eradication strategies require development of novel approaches that specifically target lymph node-resident HIV reservoirs. An effective strategy to enhance anti-retroviral (ARV) drug concentrations in secondary lymph nodes is to formulate ARVs in carriers such as nanoparticles that promote transport of compounds via the lymphatics to the draining lymph nodes. Additionally, strategies that prevent rapid clearance and maintain inhibitory concentrations of ARVs in lymph nodes for an extended time are needed to effectively suppress persistent virus expression. Hence in this application, we are proposing to develop GM3-containing membrane encapsulated nanoparticle-based approaches to establish long-term tissue depots of ARVs in lymph nodes to suppress residual viral replication. The design of these nanoparticles is based on our recent findings that demonstrate specific capture of GM3 (?2,3-linked sialic acid containing monosialo-dihexosylganglioside) containing membrane encapsulated gold nanoparticles by CD169 expressing primary human myeloid cells such as macrophages and dendritic cells in vitro and co-localization of GM3-gold NPs with CD169+ cells in lymph nodes of mice. Interestingly, capture of GM3-gold NPs resulted in sequestration and preservation within surface accessible non-lysosomal plasma membrane invaginations in CD169+ myeloid cells. Hence, we will exploit these specific interactions between GM3-containing membrane encapsulated nanoparticles and CD169 to achieve both selective targeting of lymph node resident-myeloid cells and sequestration to specialized non-lysosomal compartments for formation of ?drug depots? that achieve sustained inhibitory concentrations of ARVs. Finally, we will determine the ability of these novel ARV- containing nanocarriers to suppress virus replication in lymph nodes in a humanized mouse model of HIV-1 infection. We believe these studies are critical to development of virus-eradication strategies for eliminating persistent HIV reservoir."
"9593238","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Adolescence is a time of dramatic development, much of which varies as a function of sex. Also during this time, alcohol use becomes very common. Likely due to heightened plasticity, the adolescent brain is particularly susceptible to the neurotoxic effects of alcohol. While studies have separately documented cross- sectional sex differences in the effects of alcohol on the adolescent brain and hormonal influences on normative adolescent brain development, to fully understand sex-specific adolescent risk and resilience for alcoholism, multimodal prospective longitudinal studies are crucial. To that end, during this funding period, we will assess an additional 120 healthy non-alcohol/drug using 14-16-year-old youth using functional neuroimaging during working memory and decision making, resting state functional neuroimaging, diffusion tensor imaging, neurocognitive assessment, mood/behavior/personality assessment, and serum hormone assays. Together with over 200 youth assessed during the first funding period of the project, all youth will be quarterly monitore for changes in alcohol/drug use, and youth who emerge into heavy alcohol use (as well as a matched non-using control) will be re-assessed at two time points following initiation of heavy drinking behavior. Using a multi-modal longitudinal design, we aim to better understand sex-specific effects of heavy alcohol use on adolescent brain functioning and connectivity, as well as identify premorbid sex-specific neurobiological risk phenotypes that are predictive of problem drinking during adolescence and young adulthood. Further, we will explore moderating variables, such timing and frequency of alcohol and other drug use, as well as the role of gonadal steroids on sex-specific developmental trajectories. Disentangling sex- specific risk for and consequences of alcohol use during adolescence, in relation to normative brain development, and determining which effects may be hormonally influenced, will move the field closer to more personalized prevention and intervention strategies aimed at male and female youth."
"9173125","Binge drinking or heavy episodic alcohol use is a serious public health problem confronting American colleges. More alarming are the pervasiveness and regularity of binge drinking episodes: one in five students reports three or more binge drinking episodes in the prior two weeks. The National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism defines binge drinking as consuming more than 4-5 drinks in a two-hour period. This proposal is designed to address several of the topic areas highlighted in the Funding Opportunity Announcement (PA-14-124) titled, Alcohol-Induced Effects on Tissue Injury and Repair? and will reveal clinical, molecular and other mechanisms related to tissue injury associated with harmful alcohol use in humans. The long-term objective of our integrated research program is to develop model systems and conduct mechanistic studies to examine the initiation and pathogenesis of binge-induced cardiovascular (CV) consequences in young adults. Except for our data, CV impairments associated with repeated binge drinking episodes are unexplored in college-aged students. Binge drinking may impair vascular function, increase sympathetic activity, and oxidative stress creating a proclivity or milieu that accentuates inflammation and contributes to atherosclerosis, hypertension, and CV disease. The overall aim of this R21 grant is to determine in young adults with a history of binge drinking, if binge drinking accelerates the onset of subclinical CV disease, alters microvascular function, increases sympathetic activity and leads to exaggerated blood pressure responses to exercise. We have 2 primary hypotheses to this aim.  Hypothesis 1: There will be evidence of CV risk markers, exemplified by reduced arterial function in conduit and resistance arteries. There will be an increased arterial stiffness in central arteries (measured using pulse wave velocity) and increased central blood pressure--all of which will be greater in binge drinkers (n=50) compared to abstainers (n=50) and moderate drinkers (n=50). We hypothesize that there will be no difference in CV markers between moderate drinkers and abstainers.  Hypothesis 2: Compared to abstainers and moderate drinkers, binge drinkers will have increased adrenergic drive and microvascular dysfunction, exemplified by increased norepinephrine levels at rest and exaggerated blood pressure response to maximal exercise. In addition, we hypothesize that elevated intravascular pressure will increase the generation of oxidative stress and reduce endothelium-dependent dilation in isolated arterioles of binge drinkers compared to moderate drinkers and abstainers. To determine the latter, we will expose ?isolated vessels? (from gluteal biopsies) to high intraluminal pressure as a means to uncover the susceptibility of the circulation to vascular dysfunction following high pressure. In addition, we will investigate vasodilatory reactivity to acetylcholine in isolated resistance vessels."
"9394579","Project Summary Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most lethal brain malignancy owing to its exceptional resistance to radiation, chemotherapy and surgical resection. While 50% of all GBM cases harbor oncogenic alterations in the gene encoding the Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR), it is unclear how the vast majority of those alterations influence EGFR functionality, oncogenic activity and response to available cancer therapeutics. In contrast to EGFR variants found in other types of cancers that involve alterations primarily in the intracellularly- localized kinase domain (KD), the vast majority of EGFR alterations in GBM occur in the ectodomain (EC) extended into the extracellular space. Based on recent studies revealing therapeutic response differences between a small number of EGFR EC and KD variants, we hypothesize that the broader spectrum of oncogenic EGFR EC variants differs functionally from KD mutants with respect to oncogenic signaling and therapeutic vulnerabilities in GBM. The overarching goal of this study is to functionalize the spectrum of EGFR EC and KD aberrations occurring in GBM, as identifying bona fide ?driver? mutations and understanding their mechanism of action may inform new cancer diagnostics and therapies. The specific aims of this study are (1) to construct a barcoded EGFR allelic series library, (2) to functionally validate EGFR mutant drivers of GBM, and (3) to determine signaling and therapeutic response differences mediated by oncogenic EGFR EC and KD variants. To address these aims, established high-throughput mutagenesis and molecular barcoding strategies will be leveraged to assemble a library consisting of 64 EGFR variants and controls selected from GBM sequencing data. To determine which mutations contribute to tumorigenesis, EGFR variants will be evaluated for oncogenic activity by employing pooled functional screens using two novel in vivo models that provide the appropriate genetic and biological context of GBM. Specifically, we will combine use of CRISPR-based gene editing of known GBM tumor suppressors with our barcoded EGFR expression libraries for pooled EGFR variant competition assays using 1) an in utero brain electroporation model and 2) a modified neural stem/progenitor cell (NSC) orthotopic transplant model. To investigate mechanistic differences between EGFR EC and KD variants, we will subject NSC cell populations derived from our in vivo studies to immunoblot analysis and drug sensitivity assays to identify differential signaling pathway activation and therapeutic responses by EGFR variants. Successful completion of these studies will not only illuminate the cancer functionality and mechanisms of action of EGFR variants in GBM, but may also uncover novel biomarkers/targets that will immediately inform new therapeutic modalities to treat this fatal disease."
"9493864","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We previously demonstrated that our early intervention model system, which was centered on using the CSBS to screen all babies at the 1-year check-up as standard of care, resulted in a mean age of 12 months for screening, 14 months for evaluation, and 18 months for treatment participation. These are far younger ages than is common in the U.S. Our 3-stage model system, Get SET (S=Screen; E=Evaluate; T=Treat) Early, screened >10,000 1 year olds in our first trial run1 detecting over 100 ASD and other developmental delayed toddlers. We will build on this highly effective model by implementing a new version in two major cities: San Diego and Phoenix; Los Angeles, Irvine, and Phoenix will provide baseline control data. In Phoenix, we test the feasibility of establishing the Get SET Early model in a city with one of the lowest median incomes and oldest age of first diagnosis in America. In AIM #1, the Screen and Refer Early stage, we will create a Pediatrician Network with 100 members. In San Diego we will utilize our existing Pediatrician Network and test new innovations such as a repeat triple screen at 12, 18, and 24 months to ensure that no toddlers are missed. Speed of referral for evaluation will be compared and contrasted using parent (self) and automatic (referral i- Pad App) options. We will track every toddler with an eventual ASD diagnosis within circumscribed medical groups to determine the true sensitivity and specificity of the screening tool and the percentage of ASD toddlers detected by our model. Anonymous survey data regarding screening habits will be administered to parents and pediatricians. AIM #2 implements the Evaluate and Refer Early stage. Its key attribute is an ASD Early Evaluation Clinic that specializes in the rapid scheduling and evaluation of every referred screened positive toddler. Toddlers will enter the program at the age they fail the screen (i.e., 12, 18 or 24 months) and will be thoroughly diagnostically evaluated and tracked once per year until they turn 3 years. This specialty Clinic is at our Autism Center in San Diego and will be developed at SARRC in Phoenix. Automated versus optional self-referral for treatment will be tested and compared. AIM #3 implements the Treat Early stage. Its key attributes are a network of providers of empirically based treatment and the innovative use of an inexpensive and readily available web-based treatment tracking system to document engagement. Treatment Networks will be created in San Diego and Phoenix. Primary outcome measures include rates and ages of screening and referral, evaluation and referral, and treatment engagement; sustainability across years; diagnostic, clinical and demographic characteristics of subjects; professional and parent satisfaction at each stage. We hypothesize that providing screening tools with clear cut-off scores and guidelines for automatic referral for evaluation and treatment, will result in dramatically lowering mean age of diagnosis and treatment in Phoenix from 4-5 years down to 1-2 years; San Diego will likewise have mean ages of 1-2 years for diagnosis and treatment making them significantly earlier than Los Angeles and Irvine control sites."
"9548836","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): New therapeutics that target pathways essential for tumor angiogenesis are of significant interest in the treatment of tumor growth and metastasis. FDA-approved antiangiogenic agents such as bevacizumab that inhibit VEGF signaling have yielded varying results. While anti-VEGF therapies can be quite effective at suppressing tumor vasculatures, recent reports suggest that long-term treatment may yield serious toxicity or result in development of resistance. Endoglin is a transforming growth factor-ß (TGF-ß) co-receptor that is emerging as a unique target in antiangiogenic therapy. Endoglin is: 1) required for both normal and tumor- induced angiogenesis; 2) the gold standard biomarker of tumor vasculatures; and 3) strongly correlated with tumor progression, survival rate, and metastases. TRC105 is a humanized endoglin monoclonal antibody (mAb) currently in phase I/II trials for treatment of advanced solid or metastatic cancer. While early reports indicate that TRC105 improves tumor response and has a safety mechanism distinct from VEGF inhibitors, its long-term efficacy (i.e. sensitivity, resistance, and side effects) remains to be determined. Moreover, despite recent advances, the fundamental mechanism by which TRC105 and related endoglin mAbs inhibit tumor vasculatures is poorly understood. Our preliminary studies reveal unique antiangiogenic properties of TRC105 that are independent of cell-growth inhibition or apoptosis. Instead, TRC105 critically alters the critical balance of TGF-ß signaling to the Smad pathways, impairs endothelial migration, and promotes endoglin shedding to produce a circulating antiangiogenic factor (soluble endoglin). Based on our initial findings, we will investigate the underlying mechanisms, evaluate other endoglin-targeting mAbs for distinct epitope-related effects, and test for enhanced efficacy in combination therapy with bevacizumab. We will employ multidisciplinary approaches including TGF-ß and VEGF signaling PCR arrays to identify novel drug-sensitive targets and biomarkers, innovative biophysical studies to characterize important Ab-induced ligand binding characteristics, and validate the key mechanisms in vivo. Together, these studies will provide the first molecular and cellular data for endoglin-targeting therapies, identify new pharmacological targets for intervention, and help develop new strategies for antiangiogenic therapies."
"9396984","PROJECT SUMMARY This proposal for an NRSA Individual Fellowship is motivated by two overarching goals: 1) to provide a rich environment for learning and growth to support the candidate's development into an effective physician- scientist, and 2) to generate a molecular map of aging in the lung by applying a systems biology approach to the analysis of transcriptomic data obtained over the lifespan of the laboratory mouse. The candidate and his mentors have designed a specific training plan that includes a rigorous research component and lays the foundation for a successful career. Aging is a key risk factor for morbidity and mortality related to diseases that affect the lung, however, the biological mechanisms contributing to this are not understood. The candidate will employ a systems biology approach to analyze already generated datasets to identify molecular pathways of aging in the lung. A better understanding of aging in the lung may ultimately lead to the development of novel therapies for lung diseases in older adults. Gene expression profiling using RNA-Seq has been used to generate ?maps? of tissues by depicting tissues and purified constituent cellular populations on a molecular level. Transcriptional profiles from individuals with disease have been compared to those from healthy individuals in an attempt to develop ?signatures? for a given disease. These signatures can be useful for disease diagnosis as well as for identifying targets for therapy. This proposal focuses on the contributions of two abundant cell populations in the lung, alveolar macrophages and alveolar type II cells (AT2), to the transcriptional signatures of aging in the lung. The candidate has preliminary data demonstrating evidence of an aging signature in alveolar macrophages and AT2 cells purified from mice at 18 months compared with 3 months. This signature persists during an influenza A virus infection challenge. The purpose of this proposal is to employ a systems biology approach to analyze transcriptomic data already obtained by investigators in the candidate's laboratory that includes whole lung tissue, alveolar macrophages, and AT2 cells harvested from mice over the lifespan (2 weeks, and 6,12,18 and 24 months of age). In Specific Aim 1, the candidate will generate a transcriptional map of aging in murine whole lung and purified cellular populations of alveolar macrophages and AT2 cells. In Specific Aim 2, the candidate will determine whether the transcriptional signature of aging in alveolar macrophages is cell autonomous or is driven by changes in the alveolar local microenvironment. Over the course of this award, the candidate will learn new systems biology approaches to analyzing large time-series genomic datasets and will develop a comprehensive understanding of the age-related changes in the innate immune system of the lung. The skills developed as part of this project will serve as a guide for the analysis of similar genomic data harvested from aging humans with lung disease."
"9278787","Project 3: HIV and HIV Interventions to Promote Healthy Aging?Abstract  Driven by the large-scale HIV treatment and prevention initiatives of the past, the HIV epidemic in sub- Saharan Africa (SAA) is aging rapidly. Three persistent knowledge gaps related to aging and HIV currently stand in the way of the long-term success of the HIV treatment and prevention response. First, the dynamics of the HIV treatment and prevention cascades in older adults are poorly understood. Second, very large proportions of older adults are unaware of their HIV status and it is currently unknown which approaches increase HIV testing and programmatic linkage in older adults. Third, the long-term causal impacts of HIV treatment among aging adults in SSA are unknown, in particular regarding dementia and physical and emotional functioning. The long-term goal is to ensure that the full potential impact of `real life' mass HIV treatment and prevention strategies in SSA is realized. The objective in this application is to identify approaches to improve the HIV response for older adults in SSA. Our central hypothesis is that large proportions of older adults are currently failing to benefit fully from HIV treatment and prevention in SSA, but that these failures can be successfully addressed through population- and health systems-based interventions. The rationale for the proposed research is that once it is known how older adults can be near-universally and successfully reached for HIV testing and programmatic linkage, and what the long-term impacts of HIV treatment among aging populations in SSA are, routine health policy and intervention strategies can be designed to ensure that older adults are fully benefiting from the HIV response in the region. Building on strong preliminary data based on work funded by a previous NIH/NIA P01 (P01-AG041710), this hypothesis will be tested by pursuing three specific aims:  AIM 1: Quantify the longitudinal developments and determinants of the HIV prevention and treatment  cascades among older adults in rural South Africa.  AIM 2: Establish in a population-based randomized field experiment the impacts of alternative home-  based HIV testing strategies on HIV status knowledge and intervention uptake.  AIM 3: Establish through population-based quasi-experiments the long-term population impacts of HIV  treatment on dementia and physical functioning.  The approach is innovative, because it utilizes a longitudinal population-based health research infrastructure for population-based experiments and quasi-experiments. The proposed research is significant, because it is expected to advance our understanding how older adults can be better reached and served by effective HIV interventions. Ultimately, this understanding will ensure the long-term success of the HIV response in SSA."
"9514309","?      DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Inpatient sleep disturbance has been linked to clinically relevant and detrimental outcomes such as delirium and falls; both are known risk factors for morbidity, mortality, prolonged hospital stays, and increased healthcare costs. Based on our preliminary work of inpatient sleep and incorporating the design of other successful health information technology (IT) interventions developed by our team members, we have developed a prototype of a sleep promotion tool kit (SLEEPkit). Using the SLEEPkit, patients start the assessment of sleep and sleep disturbing factors during the previous night. The SLEEPkit software identifies a core set of evidence-based interventions directly linked to the patient-specific sleep disturbing factors. The assessment data and the associated tailored interventions are then processed by the SLEEPkit software to generate a single care plan for sleep and personalized educational content for all care providers, patients, and family members. The SLEEPkit will be integrated into an existing web-based patient portal and easily accessed from mobile devices (e.g., iPad) at the bedside by patients and their care partners. Responding to the AHRQ PA-14-001, the goal of this R21 project is to inform the development of the SLEEPkit by conducting iterative refinement, implementation, and pilot evaluation guided by the RE-AIM framework. The RE- AIM framework emphasizes the Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance of a health IT intervention in the actual clinical setting. Specifically, we will 1) iteratively refine a patient-centered SLEEPkit and integrate it as an enhancement into an existing web-based patient portal; 2) To implement the SLEEPkit on an oncology patient-care unit where the web-based patient portal is currently in place; and 3) To pilot test the effectiveness of the SLEEPkit on patient's self-perceived overall sleep quality during hospitalization. Based on the primary outcome of interest, self-perceived sleep quality measured by the PROMIS Sleep Disturbance, we plan to enroll a total of 120 patients for this pilot study. Findings of this project will inform further development and refinement of the SLEEPkit, which aims not only to improve inpatient sleep but also to be well integrated to clinical and patient workflow. The pilot evaluation will also inform the effect size of study outcomes for a future randomized controlled trial to evaluate the SLEEPkit application. Consistent with the AHRQ mission, this will lay the groundwork for making inpatient sleep promotion effective and feasible, which will ultimately change current clinical practice related to  patient sleep, hence leading to meaningful improvement in patient health, outcomes, quality of care, and cost."
"9278786","Project 2: Cardiometabolic Disease in an Aging South African Cohort?Abstract  Cardiometabolic disease (CMD) has become the leading cause of death globally as a result of epidemiologic, social, and economic transitions. Furthermore, advances in care have moved the burden of CMD onto older adults, who tend to have comorbidities and may be frail, which affects both prognosis and treatment decisions. As part of the Health and Aging in Africa: Longitudinal Studies of an INDEPTH Community (HAALSI) Program, Project 2 will assess the trajectories of traditional and novel risk factors for CMD and test whether easily identified and modifiable risk factors predict future CMD morbidity and both CMD and non-CMD mortality in an African population ?40 years. Data will be collected over six years with baseline studies completed in 2015/16 and two further waves, three years apart. Effective follow-up of cohort participants with collection of self-reported health status linked to actual clinic use, along with testing of established and novel biomarkers, will lead to a detailed understanding of the complex biologic, behavioral, demographic, and socioeconomic factors that result in increasing CMD morbidity and mortality. Project 2 is linked to Project 1 through a study of associations of CMD with cognitive impairment and dementia; Project 3 through the study of HIV/AIDS and antiretroviral therapy; Project 4 through its investigation of the impacts of salt legislation; and Project 5 through its focus on multimorbidity and frailty. We have additional genetic input into CMD risk factors through an ongoing collaboration with the Human Heredity & Health in Africa (H3Africa) project/Africa Wits-INDEPTH Partnership for the Genomic Study of Body Composition and Cardiometabolic Disease Risk (AWI-Gen). Reliable data on baseline levels of chronic CMD-related conditions, including cardiovascular diseases, stroke and diabetes in older populations are extremely limited in rural South Africa, yet understanding the rate of change in CMD is critical for planning health and social policy. Our long-term goal is to use these data to inform planning of health and social services with capacity to identify and target high-risk middle age and older persons who may benefit from simple interventions to reduce CMD morbidity and mortality. The specific aims are to: AIM 1: Evaluate the scale and trajectory of CMD in the HAALSI cohort, including the prevalence, incidence, and mortality of key conditions and their risk factors. AIM 2: Evaluate the effects of critical social determinants, in particular migration and socioeconomic disadvantage, on CMD risk. AIM 3: Develop models for identifying individuals at high risk for CMD and generate projections of future population-level CMD burden. AIM 4: Assess the evolving impact of South Africa's 2013 salt legislation (in effect from 2016) on CMD risk."
"9426424","Project Summary Autologous hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) gene therapy is one of the most promising strategies for the treatment of genetic diseases affecting the blood and immune system. Currently, the only curative treatment for patients with diseases like hemoglobinopathies or immunodeficiencies is an allogeneic HSC transplant. While outcomes with an HLA-matched sibling donor are very encouraging, most patients will not have an HLA-matched family donor. HSC transplants from unrelated donors or partially matched donors can be associated with life- threatening side effects especially from graft-vs-host disease (GVHD) and related infectious complications. To avoid these complications, efforts have been made to use the patients´ own (autologous) HSCs and correct them with either lentivirus-mediated gene therapy or gene editing. A critical problem and bottleneck, however, has been the inability to identify and purify a ?true? HSC population and therefore optimize conditions for such cells that allow for rapid multi-lineage engraftment. A reliable strategy to determine the quality and quantity of such a HSC population would be a major advance for high-throughput screening of ex vivo gene editing and expansion conditions. Using our nonhuman primate (NHP) stem cell transplantation model, we have recently identified an exclusive HSC-enriched population capable of multi-lineage short-term and long-term engraftment that is evolutionary conserved between human and NHPs. This HSC-enriched population accounts for ~3-5% of the entire CD34+ cell population, reducing the number of cells for gene therapy approaches by ~25-fold. Most importantly, flow-cytometric quantification of this HSC-enriched phenotype allowed us to reliably predict engraftment success as well as the onset of neutrophil and platelet recovery after HSC transplantation regardless of the source, gene modification, or ex vivo expansion. Availability of this novel HSC-enriched phenotype in combination with the ability to easily enrich for this subpopulation will help overcome current limitations of autologous HSC gene therapy. We hypothesize that gene editing of this HSC-enriched population will improve targeting, enhance gene editing efficiency, and increase in vivo persistence of gene-modified and corrected blood and immune cells. Furthermore, we hypothesize that this phenotype will serve as a reliable read-out to develop ex vivo culture conditions for the expansion of gene-modified HSCs promoting improved engraftment, which in turn should enable us to reduce the intensity of currently used conditioning regimens for HSC gene therapy. Evolutionary conservation of this HSC-enriched phenotype between human and NHP cells will allow us to rapidly translate these findings to clinical HSC gene therapy studies.   "
"9395657","Project Summary  A variety of hematological diseases and malignancies are caused by an underlying dysfunction in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs), the cells responsible for the maintenance of the blood system. Gold standard treatment for many of these malignancies is the effective replacement of the diseased cells via a hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT), in which healthy donor hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) self-renew, expand and give rise to hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs) that maintain all blood production for the lifetime of the individual. However, HSCTs are limited by availability of donor-matched cells and the low efficiency of ex vivo expansion of human HSPCs. Other hematological disorders and acute hematological trauma can be treated by transfusion of mature hematopoietic cells such as red blood cells and platelets; however, these treatments are also limited by donor supply. I hypothesize that SH2B3, an established negative regulator of cytokine signaling, HSC self-renewal and HSPC proliferation in mice, plays a similar role in humans and that inhibition of SH2B3 could be used to expand human HSPCs. This proposal will use two sources of HSPCs to comprehensively identify roles for SH2B3 in human hematopoiesis and test depletion of SH2B3 as a strategy to expand human HSPCs.  In Aim 1 I will use HPCs derived from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs). The cytokine directed differentiation of hPSCs to HPCs closely follows stages of hematopoietic development and the HPCs have erythroid, myeloid and megakaryocycitic lineage potential. Therefore, I will use SH2B3-/- hPSCs to help elucidate the role of SH2B3 in human hematopoietic development, in erythroid, myeloid and megakaryocytic lineage cells and to determine if targeting SH2B3 expression can augment the production of hematopoietic cells from hPSCs. Increasing hematopoietic cell production from hPSCs could be used for the in vitro manufacturing of mature hematopoietic cells for therapeutic transfusions.  Differentiation of hPSCs to HPCs does not fully recapitulate human hematopoietic development and engraftable HSCs cannot be obtained from these cells yet. Therefore, in Aim 2 I will use primary human HSPCs isolated from umbilical cord blood (UCB). By disrupting SH2B3 expression in these cells I will be able to further identify cytokine signaling cascades in which SH2B3 functions in human hematopoiesis, and determine if SH2B3 depletion results in the ex vivo and in vivo expansion of functional HSCs, which will be useful for HSCTs.  Together, these proposed studies will comprehensively identify roles of SH2B3 in human hematopoiesis and will test if SH2B3 deficiency causes an expansion of HSPCs to increase the supply of functional HSCs for use in HSCTs and mature hematopoietic cells for use in therapeutic transfusions. These studies will provide proof of concept for potential use of reversible inhibition of SH2B3 in the clinic."
"9535681","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The international, multi-site Colon Cancer Family Registry Cohort (CCFRC) is comprised of over 10,000 families and individuals at increased risk of colorectal and other cancers. Existing standardized data include baseline epidemiologic and follow-up questionnaires, clinical data, blood, samples, tumor blocks, comprehensive genotype data, including genome-wide association study (GWAS) data on a substantial proportion of subjects, and extensive molecular characterization of the colorectal tumors. In this application, we seek funding to support the infrastructure and expansion of this cohort with the following specific aims: Aim 1: Maintain the cohort by active follow-up of the CCFRC by: (i) systematically updating personal and family history of cancer and vital status, personal risk factors, prevalence of colorectal polyps, and treatment and cancer recurrence data through questionnaires and interviews; (ii) validating all reports of incident cancers diagnosed since baseline; and (iii) verifying all reports of death against regional and national death registries; (iv) continuing and enhancing with state-of-the-art approaches our retention of cohort participants over time. We will also maintain the existing Biospecimen Repositories and informatics functions. Aim 2: Continue to molecularly characterize the cohort to maximize information and efficiently facilitate multiple types of research by: (i) conducting standardized pathology review for all incident colorectal cancer cases diagnosed since baseline; (ii) sub typing incident colorectal cancer tumors by immunohistochemistry, BRAF, K-ras, and MLH1 promoter methylation; (iii) genotyping, where indicated, participants for known familial mutations in DNA mismatch repair genes and MYH; and (iv) genotyping all participants who have not yet been genotyped for 16 SNPs discovered and validated by GWAS. Aim 3: Enhancement of the cohort with additional clinical and behavioral data by: (i) collecting and abstracting medical records of treatment and recurrence data on population-based cases of colorectal cancer in the cohort since inception, and on all incident cases of colorectal cancer since baseline in selected centers that are able to accomplish this in a cost-effective manner; and (ii) strategically collecting colonoscopy and pathology reports of colonic polyps when possible for high-risk participants (i.e. Lynch Syndrome, Type X, and bi-allelic MYH carriers); and (iii) collecting additional behavioral data by questionnaire that will enhance retention of the cohort and facilitate the translation of CCFRC discoveries into clinical or public health practice. Aim 4: Continue to expand the use of the CCFRC and its resources through active collaborations with the larger scientific community."
"9389334","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This submission is a new application for the UCLA IDDRC, entitled UCLA Center for Translational Research in Neurodevelopment (UC-TRaN). The fundamental purpose of our Center is to provide an optimal environment for performing outstanding research into the causes, mechanisms, and treatments of intellectual and developmental disorders. The new leadership model in the center emphasizes collaborations among Center investigators, core personnel, and community partners, with support for research spanning basic research and clinical practice. Our aims are 1) to create cutting edge and cost effective infrastructure resources in facilities and personnel for IDD investigators; 2) to provide  integrated services within cores that support research from multidisciplinary teams and multiple levels of analysis; 3) to promote interactions between cores and among research investigators to promote collaborative, multidisciplinary and translational research, and 4) to create educational and outreach opportunities within the center, in collaboration with a West Coast Consortium of IDDRCs and community partners.  We propose five interacting cores: 1) Administration, Education and Outreach; 2) Genetics, Genomics and BioInformatics, which performs genetic analysis, sequencing, expression, and provides Big Data resources; 3) Cells, Circuits and Systems analysis, supporting electrophysiology, human iPSC and cerebral organoid culture development, and optogenetics; 4) Structural and Functional Visualization, which provides access to and analysis of imaging tools from miniaturized microscopes through animal and human MRI; and 5) Clinical Translation, supporting clinical trial development, recruitment, phenotyping across species, and collecting biosamples. The Center proposes an exciting model research project, Neurophysiological biomarkers of cognition in Dup15 syndrome: From mouse models to patients. Dup15q11.2-13.1 is associated with marked cognitive impairment and other symptoms of developmental delay. The study examines a novel EEG biomarker in a cohort of children with Dup15q and in two separate mouse models of Dup15q syndrome, one defined by an overexpression of a single gene, UBE3A, and the other from a full duplication of the region. In the animal model the project will test three mechanism-based pharmacologic treatments: d-serine, rapamycin, and a GABA-A ?5 receptor subunit inverse agonist, to determine whether these treatments change cell activation patterns and behavior. Together, the project and cores support our primary goal of optimizing outcomes of individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities by promoting outstanding translational  research."
"9389347","CORE E: Abstract  Despite an enormous increase in the basic science understanding of many IDDs, progress in  the application of this basic knowledge in the clinic has been limited. The reasons for this gap in  ?translation? are many, but most agree that advances in defining, dissecting, and understanding  the multiple dimensions of IDD phenotypes have lagged, with a few exceptions. A few examples  are illustrative. Social functioning, an obvious and foundational element of adaptive ability and  quality of life, is a natural target for intervention efforts across all IDDs, yet the field lacks  suitable measurement tools that are well suited for application in clinical trials, and few  measures have been rigorously compared to real world functioning for their precision and  validity. Social measures often applied for diagnosis (Vineland Socialization or Communication  subscales, ADOS, Social Responsiveness Scale-2, Aberrant Behavior Checklist-Social  Withdrawal subscale [ABC-SW]) are either insensitive to change (too few items and limited  range of scoring), too broad, too burdensome for repeated short-term use, too narrow, and/or  vulnerable to expectancy bias. Even though the ABC-SW subscale has received a partial  endorsement as a possible endpoint for capturing treatment effects on social behavior in Autism  Spectrum Disorder (ASD)(and a separate modification likewise proposed for Fragile X  Syndrome [FXS] trials), a review of its performance finds it vulnerable to placebo effects.  Moreover, on closer inspection, the majority of the subscale's items are restricted to social  interest alone, not capturing the many other possible social dimensions of interest. An objective  of our Core is to continue our existing efforts to creatively increase study impact by developing  and applying novel measurement approaches. An example was the substudy of McCracken and  Kasari embedded in the NIMH Research Units on Pediatric Pharmacology (RUPP) Autism  Network's Methylphenidate for the Treatment of Hyperactivity in Pervasive Developmental  Disorder randomized clinical trial (RUPP Autism Network, 2005). Using an abbreviated (<10-  minute scripted interaction repeated weekly) modification of the Early Social Communication  Scales (ESCS), we documented the first example in the literature to our knowledge of a positive  drug effect on core deficits of joint attention and emotion regulation in ASD."
"9379460","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This NIEHS-SRP project will evaluate the biogeochemical mechanisms controlling the transport and bioavailability of DNAPL and dissolved hydrophobic compounds within groundwater and at the groundwater-surface water interface and how these processes determine the efficacy of in situ remediation methods. Lipophilic contaminants in sediments may accumulate in shellfish, posing a human health risk. Sediment remediation strategies will ideally limit contaminant transport via the aqueous phase thus limiting bioaccumulation and risk. In situ capping is one remediation technique utilized to stabilize and physically isolate contaminated sediments to reduce exposure to biota and humans. Caps are designed to resist physical disturbance by erosion and bioturbation, and are consequently composed primarily of coarse granular material, which is highly permeable. Recent work has shown that groundwater-surface water interactions include numerous advection mechanisms that operate independently of canonical groundwater flow. As a result, DNAPL and contaminated porewater advection may be orders of magnitude higher than expected from groundwater considerations alone, reducing the effectiveness of capping for in situ remediation. This study will provide new understanding of surface water- groundwater interactions and DNAPL contaminant degradation, transport, and bioavailability; novel methods for evaluating shallow advection rates and pore water PAH concentrations for site characterization to guide in situ remediation; and guidance for remediation managers to improve safe and effective cap design where groundwater advection processes are active. Hypothesis 1. Bioavailable PAH concentrations in porewater at the sediment-water interface are decoupled from PAH flux due to non-equilibrium effects when advection dominates diffusional transport. 2. DNAPL mobility is enhanced by the intrusion of dense seawater, resulting in transport of liquid organic phase in saline and brackish coastal groundwater. 3. Advection in subaqueous permeable sediments results in measurable disequilibrium between parent and daughter nuclides of the naturally-occurring Th-Ra-Rn system that  is proportional to advective flux. 4. Advection dynamics and seawater intrusion increase bioavailable PAH flux and NAPL transport in permeable cap materials used for in situ remediation at contaminated sites  in the Elizabeth River."
"9419681","ABSTRACT There are several safe candidate adjuvants that potentiate beneficial immunity following vaccination. However, single adjuvant formulations have performed quite modestly in terms of stimulating the desired blend of humoral versus cellular immunity and/or Th1 versus Th2 immunity. Combination adjuvants offer a possible way forward, but the mechanisms of action of such combinations remain poorly defined. Therefore, we will combine the FDA-approved adjuvant Alum (alhydrogel) with the CD1d-binding glycolipid adjuvant ?-galactosylceramide (?-GC) and delineate the mechanisms of action with a particular emphasis on CD1d-restricted Natural Killer T (NKT) cells and humoral immunity. Alum is safe and stimulates excellent Th2 but poor Th1 immunity. We discovered that the Th2 response to Alum depends in large part upon diverse TCR-expressing Type II NKT cells (dNKT) which recognize CD1d/glycolipid complexes but do not recognize the ?-GC adjuvant. The ?-GC adjuvant stimulates semi-invariant TCR-expressing Type I NKT cells (iNKT) and results in a mixed Th1/Th2 response. It is already known from Phase I clinical trials in patients with cancer that ?-GC is well-tolerated and safe. Furthermore, modification of the ?-GC structure can readily be employed to skew the Type I NKT- dependent Th1/Th2 balance. Our objective for this proposal is to test the central hypothesis that the combination of Alum and ?-GC leads to CD1d/glycolipid presentation and a coordinated dNKT and iNKT- driven mixed Th1/Th2 response against vaccine antigens. In Specific Aim 1, we will perform a series of in vitro studies in primary murine and human cells to determine how the adjuvant combination affects CD1d Ag presentation and activation and functional differentiation of NKT cells into different effector subsets. We will also examine the effect of adjuvant combination on class I and class II presentation of co-administered protein antigens. In Specific Aim 2, we will undertake a series of in vivo experiments in mice to examine the functional consequences of adjuvant combination for Ab-mediated protection against bacterial toxins. Experiments to analyze cellular as well as humoral immunity will be included as the project develops and in vivo toxicity (or lack thereof) will be determined by measurement of pro-inflammatory cytokines as well as markers of autoimmunity and organ damage. We feel this project is innovative because it will provide the vaccine community with mechanistic information when CD1d-binding adjuvants are combined with Alum adjuvant and give careful consideration to NKT cell- driven components of the immune response. We feel the project is significant because it will illuminate potential avenues for inclusion of CD1d-binding glycolipids in mixed adjuvant platforms."
"9493766","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of the proposed work is to implement a system-level intervention to (a) improve early detection of autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and (b) increase early access to autism specific early intervention services, especially for children who often are not given the known benefits of early intervention services. The proposed study builds on a funded multi-stage screening study that is currently being implemented in 3 Early Intervention programs serving children in the Circle of Promise, a Boston region with high social/economic risk and comprised of a high percentage of children from racial/ethnic minority populations, English language learners, or living in poverty. ASD Rates are increasing in the U.S., with recent estimates indicating that 1 in 88 children have ASD. Early diagnosis and intervention are crucial to ensuring optimal long-term outcomes; yet significant disparities exist in rates and age of diagnosis. Children in the above groups are less likely to be diagnosed and are diagnosed 1-2 years later than White, non-poor, English speaking children. This delay limits access to autism-specific early treatments. Timely identification and treatment requires at least two steps: 1) knowing and identifying the early signs of ASD, and 2) acting early. Pediatricians, parents, and EI providers must decide whether a child is showing enough signs to justify further assessment or treatment, or whether the child is at low enough risk to forego immediate action. Thus, acting early requires the about groups to evaluate the early signs and choose a yes/no course of action, which we refer to as a clinical threshold. We believe that early identification and access to care can be improved both by increasing knowledge of the early signs of ASD and by influencing these decision thresholds regarding when to screen, assess, and refer to ASD-specific interventions. Moreover, access to services requires agreement and cooperation among these decision-makers. Guided by our prior theoretical work and engagement with pediatricians and EI providers, we will influence improved access and receipt of needed services for children with ASD by offering: (1) multistage ASD screening to all EI-enrolled children ages 14-24 months, (2) motivational interviewing to parents whose children qualify for ASD services, and (3) systematic outreach to pediatricians from EI sites. This system- level approach involves altering the context in which pediatricians, EI providers, and parents assess and act on signs of ASD to reduce disparities in access to ASD diagnosis and services. This study will test the following hypotheses: 1) Exposed children with ASD will be more likely to be identified, referred, and receive ASD services, regardless of race/ethnicity, language or poverty status; 2) Exposed pediatricians and EI providers will identify more children with ASDs and refer to assessment and services at higher rates; and 3) Exposed parents of children with ASD will report greater agreement with and will be more likely to follow through on ASD-specific assessment and service referrals."
"9597452","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose to extend our Center for Excellence for Research in Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CERC)-The Wisconsin Center for the Neuroscience and Psychophysiology of Meditation-for a second five-year period. This will be a highly focused center dedicated to novel and cutting edge research on the mechanisms by meditation works. In the next five-year period, two of the original three projects will continue wih important new components. Project 1 (Davidson, PI) will examine the impact of the explicit use of mindfulness and loving-kindness-compassion strategies on emotion regulation, specifically neural, hormonal and behavioral (including facial electromyography in the scanner) indices of reactivity to and recovery from pictures of human suffering and flourishing. Project 2 will be directed by William Busse, a well-known asthma researcher at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Based upon collaborative work by Busse and Davidson that established the neural circuitry activated by asthma-relevant emotional stimuli that predicts inflammatory response in asthmatics, we propose to examine the impact of Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) on altering the neural signals and inflammatory response in the lung in a group of asthmatics. The third project will be focused on sleep and directed by Giulio Tononi. This project will extend our previous findings by examining whether the increase in gamma oscillations during NREM sleep in meditators is associated with changes in mental content during sleep. In addition, relations between sleep and waking EEG and between sleep EEG changes and waking performance on cognitive and attentional measures, and experience sampling measures, will be studied. Each of these projects will be conducted with the identical group of participants recruited through our Core that will include those randomized assigned to MBSR, the active comparison intervention we explicitly developed to test against MBSR~the Health Enhancement Program (HEP)~or a wait list (WL), as well as Long-Term Meditators (LTMs). We believe that the understanding of the mechanisms by which meditation produces changes in behavioral and biological processes will be dramatically advanced through the work of this CERC."
"9589842","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Bacteriophages are the most abundant biological entity in the biosphere. They facilitate the evolution of bacterial pathogenicity by imposing selection for resistance to infection and by horizontal gene transfer of host genes to new bacteria. More specifically, phages often carry toxins and virulence factors that convert benign bacteria into human pathogens, facilitating the spread of bacterial infections. Most phages utilize elaborate tail machines to translocate their viral DNA and proteins, across bacterial membranes, into a host cell. In addition, these highly sophisticated molecular machines are responsible for host-cell recognition, attachment, and cell wall penetration. However, initial adsorption and genome ejection remain the least understood aspects of any phage life cycle. The central hypothesis is that the tail machine undergoes a cascade of coordinated conformational changes to efficiently infect a host bacterium. The objective of this application is to document these conformational rearrangements by determining intermediate structures of Podoviridae T7, Myoviridae T4, and Siphoviridae ? during infection by combining high throughput cryo-electron tomography (cryo- ET) with molecular genetics of both phage and host. Comparative structural analysis of these three morphotypes, together with a wealth of biochemical and structural information, will provide new insights into the mechanistic pathways of phage infection at a molecular level."
"9448519","ABSTRACT Despite decades of advances in clinical care, the high incidence of staphylococcal infections remain a major public health concern. Multiple antibiotic-resistant isolates of Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative Staphylococcus epidermidis are frequently isolated in the hospital environment and significantly limit therapeutic options. Indeed, it is increasingly becoming evident that a fundamental understanding of staphylococcal biology and factors affecting its fitness are required for the development of effective therapeutics. Towards this goal, we have recently identified important physiological functions for arginine catabolic enzymes including nitric oxide synthase (NOS) and arginine deiminase (ADI), in promoting growth and controlling programmed cell death (PCD) in staphylococci. Under normal physiological conditions, NOS activity promotes growth by activating respiration and preventing metabolic dysfunction including excessive production of the polysaccharide intracellular adhesin (PIA). However, influx of acetate (a byproduct of glucose metabolism) into the cytoplasm under acidic conditions appears to corrupt normal function of NOS and promotes NOS-dependent production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and PCD. Interestingly, carbon flux through the ADI pathway appears to counter NOS-dependent PCD. The mechanism by which these pathways affect staphylococcal physiology is still under intense investigation and constitutes the subject of this application. In Aim #1, we will test how NOS promotes growth by suppressing PIA production as part of its normal physiological activity. Further, we will investigate if phenylalanine plays a role in NOS-dependent PIA suppression and whether NOS activity affects the pathogenic potential of staphylococci using an infant mouse model of central nervous system (CNS) catheter infection. In Aim #2, we will test the hypothesis that NOS-dependent ROS production during PCD results from NOS uncoupling, a phenomenon wherein NOS generates superoxide rather than nitric oxide as byproduct. Finally in Aim #3, we will test the potential for the arginine deiminase and the arginase pathways in countering PCD by activating catalase activity through glutamate biosynthesis. On completion of these studies, we will gain a deeper mechanistic understanding of how various arginine catabolic pathways affect staphylococcal physiology and fitness."
"9527434","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Epigenetic regulation constitutes a fundamentally important set of gene control mechanisms that profoundly influence chromatin function, with direct relevance to a large number of human diseases. Histone lysine methylation and demethylation are components of a histone code, and the recognition of these methyl marks underlies epigenetic regulation. For example, overexpression of a histone lysine demethylase, PHF8, has been noted in primary prostate cancer samples, where it is associated with increased invasiveness and a poorer prognosis. The inherently reversible nature of epigenetic modifications makes enzymes that modify histones and DNA attractive candidates for therapeutic intervention. Thus far such epigenetic therapies have focused on the enzymes that regulate histone acetylation and DNA methylation, with several HDAC and DNMT inhibitors now in clinical use and FDA approved for the treatment of leukemias and other cancers. The enzymes involved in regulating histone methylation patterns and levels have emerged as highly promising therapeutic targets, with newer histone methyltransferase inhibitors recently entering preclinical testing. Histone lysine demethylases (belong to a broad family of non-heme Fe(II)-dependent dioxygenases), on the other hand, remain a relatively untapped source of potential druggable targets. The central goal of this proposal is to validate, re-design, and synthesize small molecule inhibitors of histone lysine demethylases in vitro, and to investigate the mechanism(s) of inhibition by nature (iso)flavone derivatives."
"9542507","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   War-related violence is an impediment to the health and development of young people; it threatens their adult functioning and the well-being of future generations. Prior research has demonstrated high rates of emotional and behavioral problems among war-affected youth. These problems may be exacerbated in the post-conflict setting, where dramatic societal disruptions are compounded by poverty, poor educational access, and loss of key sources of familial and community support. Currently, 15 African countries are involved in war, or are experiencing post-conflict instability. Despite the high burden of conflict in sub-Saharan Africa, understanding of the intergenerational effects of such experiences is limited to studies in industrialized countries, such as those focused on the effects of the Holocaust in Europe. In diverse populations, understanding how childhood war-related experiences and post-conflict stressors influence the well-being and functioning of adults as well as the health and development of their offspring is crucial to designing effective interventions. I particular, as war-affected youth start families of their own, opportunities exist to examine how child rearing is influenced by childhood war experiences and interruptions in social relationships due to war. The proposed research will significantly advance knowledge of the intergenerational effects of war in diverse cultural groups using ecological developmental theory to study mechanisms of the intergenerational transmission of violence as well as resilience operating in individuals, families, and communities. Building on a rare prospective longitudinal study of former child soldiers and other youth exposed to war in Sierra Leone, the study will conduct a fourth wave of data collection in a cohort (N=529), first interviewed in 2002 as 10-17 year- olds, to examine the long-term effects of war experiences on adult and family mental health and functioning. A key innovation of the proposed study is the enrollment of the offspring and intimate partners of the original cohort. An expanded survey battery will assess family dynamics, parenting, intimate partner relationships, family violence, and the physical, cognitive, and emotional development of offspring. Analyses will explore mechanisms linking individual, family, and child outcomes to conflict-related experiences and post-conflict adversities and resources. The research is intended to identify parental factors, family processes, and societal mechanisms to target in interventions to help war-affected children and families achieve their full potential or healthy and productive lives. Active participation of Community Advisory Boards and strong collaborations between investigators and local institutions will inform the study design, ensure strong retention of participants and provide channels for dissemination. Research findings will identify priorities for interventions to assist diverse populations affected by war, including refugees from war-torn regions who have resettled in the US."
"9278788","Project 4: Research Plan?Abstract  The goal of this project is to understand how public policies affect the health of older men and women in the Agincourt Community, a Health and Socio-Demographic Surveillance System (HDSS), South Africa. Our baseline wave of 5,059 men and women ?40 for the Health and Aging in Africa: Longitudinal Studies of an INDEPTH Community (HAALSI) study found a strong socioeconomic gradient in a number of health outcomes from specific chronic conditions to measures of physical and cognitive function. Our key hypothesis is that public policies can improve population health and reduce health disparities, especially among older men and women. South Africa has several active and proposed new public policies in the form of social grants and public health measures that make it an interesting testbed for study. These policies have direct relevance for US public policy. Initial findings from the HAALSI baseline found that health of the elderly was strongly increasing with family size, leading us to the hypothesis that older peoples' health is a public good within the family rather than a private good, and which may explain disproportionally large effects on health from social grants. We will investigate how changes in eligibility for grants based on age affect health. The baseline study also found low take up of some grants by the elderly and we will examine the reasons for this. In addition to social grants, South Africa is introducing new policies on sugar- sweetened drinks and salt in processed foods. Evaluation of salt legislation is evaluated in Project 2 in relation to biomarkers and health with input from Project 5. In Project 5, we aim to investigate how these policies affect behaviors related to food and drink consumption and with regard to sugar-sweetened drink consumption, how the policy impacts obesity. This project has four specific aims:  AIM 1: To measure and describe the relationship between socioeconomic conditions and the health  and wellbeing of older people in Agincourt, South Africa.  AIM 2: To explore the concept of heath as a family public good. We will study the effect of changes in  individual health on the wellbeing of other family members and the household health production function.  AIM 3: To determine how social grants affect the health of the elderly in Agincourt, South Africa, and  ascertain the reasons for non-take-up of grants among older people who appear to meet eligibility criteria.  AIM 4: To assess the effect of the introduction of new taxes on sugar-sweetened drinks and limits on  salt in processed foods on consumption and health risk factors."
"9471510","Abstract Funds are being requested to provide partial support for the 15th Annual South Central Medical Mycology (SCMM) meeting to be held at Chateau LeMoyne Hotel in the French Quarter of New Orleans, LA on November 17th and 18th, 2017. SCMM prides itself on bringing a critical mass of medical mycology researchers together from the south central region of the United States to share the latest research being conducted in the various labs, provide opportunities for collaboration, and promote the development of junior trainees in participating laboratories. The meeting site rotates between university-centered locations in the south central region where fungal-centric laboratories are located. Principal Investigators and students/postdocs from ~15 laboratories usually attend annually (including laboratories in the host city). In total there are upwards of 20 laboratories that have attended one or more of the meetings depending on the location site. Hence, a strong and growing critical mass of medical mycologists have supported this meeting and led to its longevity and significance over the past 16 years. Although the meeting format has evolved over the years, the current format has focused on oral presentations by trainees regarding their most exciting and impactful unpublished data. The small group setting provides a welcoming environment that has been successful in promoting discussion and constructive feedback for trainees. Hence, the primary objectives of the meeting are to 1) bring regionally-based medical mycologists together to share research, initiate collaborations, and provide a venue for trainees to present their latest work, and 2) promote the development of young/junior scientists as a mentoring tool to facilitate their transition into academic scientists or their chosen career path. The funding requested is for trainee travel awards (n=10) and to cover costs of the venue."
"9389345","CORE D: Abstract   The foremost objective of the Structural and Functional Visualization Core is to provide state of the art  imaging services to the IDDRC community, including both conventional and confocal microscopy, whole  animal MRI acquisition and analysis support. To attain this goal, the core has been redesigned to provide  comprehensive imaging services for IDDRC researchers working at on any aspect of the genetic and  environmentally-induced developmental diseases affecting nervous system development and function. The  research ongoing in the IDDRC spans basic scientists using reductionist approaches to elucidate the  mechanisms specific to intellectual developmental disabilities (IDDs) to clinicians assessing therapeutic  interventions for patients. To accommodate all of their imaging requirements, we are now providing access  to three light microscopy cores, including a microscopy suite dedicated to IDDRC researchers, two MRI  facilities and the technical support needed to initiate and complete any imaging analysis. Many IDDRC  researchers have imaging systems within their own laboratories, however they are often insufficient to meet  their demand and are never comprehensive. Being able to access the IDDRC-supported microscopy cores  thus both adds capacity and provides technical resources not otherwise available, permitting researchers to  refocus their studies in novel and innovative directions.   A second key objective of the Structural and Functional Visualization Core is to develop new  technologies for visualizing biological samples and in turn provide them to IDDRC researchers. Here, we  focus on [1] developing smaller lighter one-photon miniaturized fluorescent microscopes for live imaging  neural activity in freely moving animals (1-3) and [2] refining the methods for CLARITY, a protocol that  renders tissue transparent (4, 5), thereby permitting unparalleled visual acuity into the complex circuitry of  the brain. These techniques offer the promise of a holistic approach to cutting edge imaging, permitting  IDDRC researchers to translate mechanism into therapy. For example, researchers investigating a specific  intellectual disorder, such as Dup15q syndrome (see model project), will be able perform MRI on patients to  identify the affected region of  the brain, implant miniaturized microscopes in rodent models to perform in vivo i m a g i n g to examine how  the firing patterns of specific populations of neuron are mechanistically altered by the disease, while  concomitantly examining putative aberrant circuit formation using light microscopy coupled with CLARITY.   Finally, this core also supports the efforts of all the other cores, offering IDDRC researchers the  ability to both probe molecular and cellular function at any level from the sub-cellular to living animals  and determine the consequence of therapeutic interventions."
"9383020","Cell entry and genome replication are two essential processes of any viral life cycle. The atomic details of these processes are largely unknown for large non-enveloped viruses, unlike enveloped viruses like flu, AIDS and herpes viruses. Upon cell entry, non-enveloped dsRNA viruses sense environmental changes for internal transcription activation. We have studied non-enveloped dsRNA viruses with a single-layered (cytoplasmic polyhedrosis virus - CPV), a double-layered (aquareovirus), and a triple-layered (bluetongue virus ? or BTV ? a member of the Reoviridae family) capsid. Because of its well studied molecular biology and the existence of a reverse genetics system, BTV in particular serves as a good model system for studying cell entry and transcription by such viruses. Thus, the goal of this project is to use state-of-the-art cryo electron microscopy and tomography to determine the structural basis of dsRNA virus cell entry and genome transcription. Our results on BTV show that VP5 contains features similar to membrane fusion proteins and undergoes significant conformational changes at low pH to form a filamentous trimer structure. We hypothesize that this filamentous structure interacts and subsequently breaks endosomal membrane during cell entry. Using the simplest member (CPV) of the Reoviridae, we recently determined organization of dsRNA genome and transcriptional enzyme complex, and showed that RNA transcription activation is mediated by the SAM- dependent ATPase activity of its capping protein. This result, together with earlier observations in CPV and other members of the Reoviridae that RNA transcription activities were coupled with ATP hydrolysis (and more recently with viral ATPase activity), lead to our second hypothesis that the BTV capping protein (VP4) also contains an ATPase, which, triggered by the removal of outer shell, mediates activation of BTV RNA transcription. In Aim 1, we will incubate BTV virions and recombinant VP5 (wild-type and mutants) with liposomes at neutral and low pH and observe possible molecular interactions between viral particles and lipid membrane with cryo electron tomography (cryoET). Such direct structural data ? expected at nanometer resolution with phase plate and energy-filtering technologies and subtomogram averaging ? will test our first hypothesis and clarify whether and how VP5 penetrates liposomes. Aims 2-3 will test our hypothesis on the mechanism of RNA transcription. First, to clarify how VP5 detachment triggers conformational changes, we will determine the atomic structures of the BTV virion (pre-triggering, all transcription substrates) and cores (post- triggering: with only ATP or under transcribing condition) by icosahedral reconstruction (Aim 2). Second, to learn how these conformational changes lead to transcription activation, we will determine the atomic structures of transcriptional enzyme complex and dsRNA genome organization of cores (transcribing, ATP) and virions (all transcription substrates) by asymmetric reconstruction (Aim 3). These studies will be complemented by structure-based mutagenesis with our established method to obtain recombinant particles."
"9424272","Abstract: The Gut Microbiota and Graft-versus-Host Disease Hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) can be lifesaving for the treatment of numerous conditions, including leukemia, lymphoma, aplastic anemia, multiple myeloma, some immunodeficiencies, and other diseases. Unfortunately, graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) is a common complication of HCT, affecting up to 50% of allogeneic transplant recipients, despite human leukocyte antigen (HLA) matching between donor and recipient and despite use of immunoprophylaxis. GVHD most commonly affects the gut, liver, and skin, producing diarrhea, liver inflammation, and rashes, with varying stages (degrees) of organ involvement in different patients. GVHD is thought to arise from immune cells (e.g. T cells) in the graft that recognize host tissues as foreign and propagate an inflammatory response. It is unclear why some HCT recipients with equivalent HLA matching develop GVHD while others are spared, and why some patients with GVHD respond to immune suppression with glucocorticoid treatment while others develop steroid-refractory GVHD with high mortality. Some murine studies of bone marrow transplantation have shown that germ-free animals are protected from GHVD, and human studies have suggested that patients with GVHD have a less diverse gut microbiota early after transplant, pointing to the important role that microbes play in GVHD. This study will investigate which gut bacterial species or communities are most associated with risk of GVHD in a longitudinal study of HCT recipients where stool samples are collected weekly for 100 days, then monthly for 9 months, and subjected to broad-range 16S rRNA gene PCR with high-throughput sequencing for species-level taxonomic identification of bacteria. Stool samples from these patients will also be assayed for small molecule metabolites produced by the bacteria-host interaction that may mediate GVHD, such as short chain fatty acids and bile salts. The goal of this aim is to identify potential chemical effectors of GVHD. Metagenomic sequencing of stool DNA will be used to assess the functional and metabolic capability of gut bacterial communities to illuminate how particular bacterial communities produce metabolites linked to GVHD risk, and to identify particular bacterial species or strains with the metabolic machinery for impacting GVHD risk. Knowledge gained from this study could be used in the future to design interventions to reduce the risk of GVHD based on targeted manipulation of the gut microbiota. For example, identification of particular bacterial species or strains linked to protection from GVHD, and to the production of metabolites that mediate this protection, could lead to the development of probiotics or engineered bacterial communities for reducing GVHD risk or treating GVHD. Alternatively, enhancing the production of beneficial metabolites through exogenous administration or use of prebiotics, and blocking the production of harmful metabolites could emerge as another approach for mitigating GVHD without further immune suppression in these very compromised patients."

"9394261","Project Summary Blood diseases such as anemias and hemophilia as well as cancers such as lymphoma, myeloma, and leukemia affect millions of Americans. Current treatment methods for these carry high levels of risk and are not entirely successful. Study of hematopoietic development is crucial to understanding how these diseases occur and in developing new more effective treatment methods. The nature of zebrafish development makes them an ideal model for studying hematopoietic cell development. In contrast with mammalian models, the external rapid development of zebrafish along with fluorescent reporter lines make visualization and tracking of developing blood and immune cells easy in the transparent embryos. In addition, unlike invertebrate models, the types of hematopoietic cells, their markers, and pathways are highly conserved from zebrafish to mammals. We have identified a group of cells by expression of hematopoietic markers scl and etv2. Etv2 is an ETS transcription factor that acts as a master regulator of hematopoiesis and vascular development that has function conserved among vertebrates. Scl is a bHLH transcription factor downstream of Etv2 that is one of the earliest required genes required for hematopoiesis. Because of the bilateral location of these cells just above the yolk extension adjacent to the pronephros we have named these cells pronephros-associated cells or PACs. Although at later stages, HSCs will colonize the pronephros, a functional equivalent of the mammalian bone marrow HSC niche, this domain does not correspond to any known hematopoietic site at this time point. From our preliminary data, we suggest that PACs can differentiate into different types of blood and immune lineages including macrophages and can also translocate to the vasculature. However, the origin and signaling pathways that specify these cells has not been identified. In addition their functional capabilities and contribution to hematopoietic lineages is unknown. Due to the highly conserved pathways and analogous hematopoietic sites between zebrafish and mammals, it is likely that these cells exist in mammalian embryos as well. We will utilize zebrafish to test the hypothesis that PACs are a population of uncharacterized hematopoietic progenitors that give rise to multiple blood cell types. We will determine the lineage contribution of PACs and expect that they will contribute to macrophage and other blood cell lineages. We will also characterize the expression profile of these cells compared to known hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells. The data derived from this study will help us better understand hematopoietic development and will aid in developing new treatments for life threatening blood diseases."
"9328225","Project Summary (Abstract) The vast majority of common variants associated with diseases and complex traits are non-coding, making uncovering the mechanisms underlying gene regulation extremely important. Existing genomic annotations based on a variety of sequencing studies have yielded insights into the types and locations of regulatory elements. However, they fail to fully utilize the information that has been assayed and annotations methods are not being fit to maximally capture known regulatory sites. This proposal aims to investigate which functional annotations are the best indicators of regulatory activity as measured by histone modification control and apply these annotations to understand complex disease variation. Histone modifications mark important changes in chromatin state and the genetic elements that establish these modifications play a key role in regulation that propagates all the way to the protein level. Thousands of genetic variants alter their local histone modification levels, providing a perfect opportunity to train functionally relevant annotation methods. The first aim is to develop methods for partitioning heritability of many loci in a single regression when significant associations for each locus come from distinct, small genomic regions. These will be used to partition the heritability of histone modifications across functional annotations in order to better understand the elements that contribute to their genetic control. The second aim is to use histone modification heritability explained as a metric to create new functional annotations that are maximally enriched from regulatory activity. The final aim is to apply these new annotations to partition variation of complex traits and diseases. Ultimately, this project will produce 1) a detailed understanding of genetic contributors to regulation at the chromatin level 2) a set of functional annotations for a variety of cell types that are most enriched for regulatory activity, and 3) precise definitions of genomic regions that most contribute to a number of human diseases and complex traits."
"9573397","Project Summary Bacterial meningitis is the most common serious infection of the central nervous system (CNS) and a major cause of death and disability worldwide, especially in children. Although antibiotic therapy has changed bacterial meningitis from a uniformly fatal disease to an often curable one, the overall outcome remains unfavorable, with mortality of 5 to 10% and permanent neurologic sequelae occurring in 5 to 40% of survivors, depending on patient age and pathogen. Disruption and dysfunction of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) is a hallmark event in the pathophysiology of bacterial meningitis. Little is known, however, about the very first and crucial interaction between a bacterial pathogen with the BBB that initiates this chain of events, and may ultimately determine a poor or favorable neurological outcome in meningitis patients. This proposal seeks to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of BBB response and function during bacterial infection, and why it fails as a neuroprotective barrier during bacterial meningitis. I hypothesize that BBB disruption may be due to the combined effect of bacterial entry and penetration of brain microvascular endothelium, direct cellular injury by bacterial cytotoxins, and/or activation of host inflammatory pathways that compromise barrier function. These hypotheses will be addressed with both in vitro and in vivo models of BBB penetration using Group B streptococcus as a model human pathogen associated with meningitis. Studies will also utilize isogenic bacterial mutants lacking important virulence factors such as regulators, ?invasins?, and cytotoxins; various knockout and transgenic mice and zebrafish; and key molecular tools to modulate host response pathways in the following specific aims: AIM 1: Characterize the host signaling pathways and bacterial factors that induce tight junction disruption and BBB permeability; AIM 2: Elucidate the mechanisms of bacterial entry and intracellular trafficking for BBB traversal; AIM 3: Characterize the role of astrocytes to BBB function and the pathogenesis of bacterial meningitis. These data will build upon and complement our observations to clarify the crucial position of the brain endothelium in innate immune defense against bacterial pathogens. The knowledge gained as a result of this proposal into the mechanisms of bacterial-brain penetration will provide fundamental and novel insights into BBB function as well as inform treatment strategies for bacterial meningitis and other neurodegenerative disorders."
"9395766","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT: N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is a reversible modification in mRNAs that has been shown to regulate many aspects of mRNA metabolism and function, including splicing, translation, and degradation. The biological effects of m6A methylation are mediate by writer enzymes that methylate mRNA, eraser enzymes that remove the methylation mark, and reader enzymes that selectively bind m6A residues. m6A methylation is involved in a number of important biological processes, including regulating mRNA turnover during stem cell differentiation. Despite its importance as a gene regulatory mechanism, how mRNA methylation influences the development and pathology of cancer is not well understood. In particular, comprehensive characterization of m6A levels and the roles of the writer, eraser, and reader proteins in cancer patients is lacking. Cancer sequencing efforts have found that METTL14, a subunit of the m6A writer complex, is frequently mutated in patients with endometrial cancer, providing an opportunity to investigate the role of m6A methylation in cancer. Preliminary studies of endometrial tumors suggest that reduced m6A methylation in tumors may act as a novel, key driver of tumor growth and malignancy. Therefore, I propose to extend these preliminary data by performing experiments to investigate the role of reduced m6A methylation as a driver of endometrial cancer, determine the mechanisms for how reduced m6A methylation alters the proliferation of endometrial cancer, and investigate the factors leading to altered m6A methylation in endometrial tumors. In Aim 1, I will characterize the effects of writer knockdown and eraser overexpression in endometrial cancer cell lines to determine how reduced m6A methylation affects cell proliferation in vitro and in vivo. In addition, I will characterize these cell lines as well as tumor samples exhibiting altered m6A methylation to identify particular transcripts and mechanisms mediating the changes to cell proliferation. In Aim 2, I will investigate which signaling pathways commonly altered in endometrial cancer regulate m6A methylation in endometrial cancer. I will supplement these experiments with sequencing studies of patient samples to identify additional factors that regulate m6A methylation in endometrial cancer. Together these experiments will advance our understanding of the mechanisms underlying endometrial cancer, provide insights into the signaling pathways that regulate mRNA methylation, and may establish these key enzymes in the mRNA methylation pathway as targets for novel cancer diagnostics and therapeutics."

"9449014","Project Summary/Abstract Due to a lack of effective antibiotics, Acinetobacter baumannii is one of the six most dangerous bacterial ?superbugs? that cause one of the world?s three most serious human health threats. Exacerbating this is a dramatic decline in the number of new antibiotics effective against A. baumannii, which can cause serious bloodstream, respiratory tract, wound, and other infections with very high morbidity and up to 80% mortality. Carbapenem (a member of the ?-lactam class of antibiotics)-resistant (CR) A. baumannii infections cost the U.S. health-care system $389 million per year. As A. baumannii isolates resistant to most or all antibiotics in monotherapy are rapidly increasing in the United States and worldwide, monotherapy is clearly no longer viable. With clinicians therefore being forced to use empiric, non-optimized combinations that may fail and lead to even more resistance, the development of novel dosing strategies that use antibiotics in efficacious combinations is critical. This project will yield promising combination dosing schemes to combat multidrug- resistant (MDR) and pandrug-resistant (PDR) A. baumannii. Our preliminary data show that combining a carbapenem with an aminoglycoside antibiotic is highly effective against MDR A. baumannii. To rationally optimize therapies, this project will provide the first systematic data on the binding of ?-lactam antibiotics to their bacterial target receptors in A. baumannii (Aim 1, stage 1). This will identify the optimal sets of bacterial target receptors that should be bound and inactivated by ?-lactam antibiotics and will greatly improve optimal ?-lactam therapies. In stage 2 of Aim 1, in vitro infection models will assess bacterial killing and resistance prevention for innovative two- and three-drug combination dosing strategies against MDR and PDR A. baumannii. These in vitro models can simulate antibiotic concentration-time profiles that mirror those in patients. Combination regimens to be tested include simultaneous and sequential dosing with normal and short-course aminoglycoside therapy. The ability of novel broad-spectrum ?-lactamase inhibitors to significantly enhance the activity of ?-lactam antibiotics in A. baumannii will be assessed. In Aim 2, the kinetics of target receptor binding by ?-lactams will be evaluated, and transcriptomic and genomic approaches applied to elucidate the mechanistic basis for resistance prevention, using bacterial samples from Aim 1. Next, in Aim 3, data on target receptor binding, drug concentrations, bacterial killing, resistance prevention, and resistance mechanisms will be used to develop new mechanism-based models. Applying these models will rationally optimize two- and three-drug combination dosing strategies that better target MDR and PDR A. baumannii. In Aim 4, these regimens will be validated prospectively via dynamic in vitro and murine pneumonia models with an intact or compromised immune system. This project holds excellent promise for developing efficacious and robust combination dosing strategies against MDR and PDR A. baumannii for testing in future clinical trials."

"9422139","Project Summary/Abstract Monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B) is a highly abundant protein in the brain that generates oxidative stress, removes monoamines such as dopamine and norepinephrine that support normal mood, and influences the predisposition towards apoptosis. MAO-B levels and activity are highly correlated and increase after chronic stress hormone exposure. MAO-B activity is increased in rodent brain after chronic unpredictable stress, however, MAO-B has not been studied in the most common early onset (age<45 years) major depressive disorder (MDD). Using [11C]SL25.1188 positron emission tomography, we propose to study whether MAO-B VT is elevated in key brain regions in early onset MDD during medication free major depressive episodes; (MDE; n=31), and in medication free major depressive episodes with a history of treatment resistance (n=31) as well as age matched healthy controls (from n=46). The intention is to make a convincing case that MAO-B levels are frequently elevated in key affect modulating regions during MDE, especially treatment resistant MDE. Such results could be applied to develop strategies for matching MDE cases of elevated MAO-B level towards MAO-B inhibitor treatments in the clinic through identifying low cost predictors of elevated MAO-B level (such as the clinical and RDOC measures proposed and/or additional peripheral protein or genetic biomarkers in future study)."
"9486672","Summary Cryptosporidium remains a significant AIDS-related opportunistic infection among people with late HIV diagnosis or without access to HAART. This parasite infects the gastrointestinal (GI) epithelium in humans; infection is also a common cause of diarrhea in young children in developing countries. There is currently no fully effective therapy available for the infection. This parasite has been referred as a ?minimally invasive? mucosal pathogen, and epithelial antimicrobial defense is key to mucosal innate anti-Cryptosporidium immunity. Whereas it is well appreciated that IFN-? is required for preventing development of intestinal cryptosporidiosis, the key cellular regulatory elements that determine IFN-?-mediated GI epithelial anti- Cryptosporidium defense, as well as its association with the high susceptibility of infection in AIDS patients and in young children, remain unknown. Our recent studies demonstrate that IFN-?-mediated epithelial anti- Cryptosporidium defense requires the induction of specific long intergenic non-coding RNAs (lincRNAs) in epithelial cells. Specifically, we have identified several lincRNAs that are expressed strictly in epithelial cells. Expression levels of several epithelial lincRNAs are upregulated in GI epithelial cells following Cryptosporidium infection. Knockdown of selected epithelial lincRNAs attenuated IFN-?-mediated epithelial anti-Cryptosporidium defense. Based on these observations, we hypothesize that induction of epithelial lincRNAs in GI epithelial cells upon pattern-recognition receptors signaling promotes mucosal anti-Cryptosporidium immunity through priming epithelial cells for IFN-?-mediated epithelial antimicrobial defense. We will use in vitro and in vivo infection models and complementary biochemical, molecular, and morphologic approaches to define the transcription of epithelial lincRNA genes upon pattern-recognition receptor signaling in GI epithelial cells following Cryptosporidium infection (Aim 1), elucidate the molecular mechanisms by which epithelial lincRNAs promote IFN-?-mediated epithelial anti-cryptosporidial defense (Aim 2), and decipher the roles of specific RNA- binding proteins in modulating IFN-?-mediated anti-cryptosporidial defense in GI epithelial cells through their interactions with epithelial lincRNAs (Aim 3). The proposal is conceptually innovative as it tests new concepts regarding mucosal antimicrobial defense and the pathogenesis of intestinal cryptosporidiosis, relevant to the design and implementation of new therapeutic strategies."
"9548405","Epilepsy arising from the temporal lobes is particularly devastating because it is both common and commonly resistant to symptomatic therapy with anticonvulsants. Preclinical and clinical studies support the idea that an episode of status epilepticus followed by recovery contributes to development of temporal lobe epilepsy months or years later. Insight into the mechanisms by which status epilepticus induces temporal lobe epilepsy may facilitate developing preventive and/or disease modifying therapies. We recently discovered a molecular signaling pathway by which status epilepticus induces temporal lobe epilepsy, namely activation of the brain- derived neurotrophic factor receptor, TrkB. A major unresolved question, to be addressed in this application, is how this signaling is transformed into the cellular and circuit modifications that underlie temporal lobe epilepsy. The anatomic locale at which status epilepticus induced activation of TrkB provides a valuable clue to the cellular consequences. The principal site was the synaptic boutons of the mossy fiber axons of hippocampal dentate granule cells. The objective of this application is to test three facets of our unifying hypothesis: a) that status epilepticus induces plasticities of mossy fiber synapses with both CA3 pyramidal cells and inhibitory interneurons; b) that status epilepticus induction of these plasticities requires TrkB; and c) that transmitter release from the mossy fibers underlies expression of temporal lobe epilepsy."

"9473232","As bacteria grow and divide, they constantly break down peptidoglycan strands to allow for cell wall expansion or reshaping the cell wall for septation and cell separation. Unlike most Gram-­negative bacteria, Neisseria gonorrhoeae releases significant amounts of the peptidoglycan fragments produced during these processes. The released peptidoglycan fragments induce inflammatory responses in multiple cell types and cause sloughing of ciliated cells in the Fallopian tube. The ciliated cell sloughing is characteristic of gonococcal pelvic inflammatory disease and leads to the loss of the ability to move an egg down the oviduct. We have worked to characterize the enzymes that act in peptidoglycan breakdown so that we can understand the process of peptidoglycan fragment production. We are characterizing these enzymes to determine their substrates and products as well as subcellular localization and location relative to the septum on the gonococcal cell. Using mutants lacking genes for certain peptidoglycan degradation enzymes, we determined that ciliated cell sloughing occurs in response to peptidoglycan monomers with a three amino acid peptide, implicating pattern-­recognition receptor NOD1 in the cellular response. We also discovered that gonococci release a second immunostimulatory muropeptide, a glycosidically-­linked peptidoglycan dimer that stimulates NOD2. In this study we will characterize lytic transglycosylases for the generation of the peptidoglycan dimers and characterize the enzymes that create the free peptide that serves as a NOD1 agonist. We will examine AmpG function in peptidoglycan fragment recycling and determine how gonococci sense peptidoglycan fragments in the cytoplasm and regulate peptidoglycan fragment release or uptake. Finally we will characterize cellular responses to released peptidoglycan fragments to understand how Fallopian tube tissue is damaged in pelvic inflammatory disease and how neutrophils respond to released eptidoglycan fragments."

Longitudinal biomarker measurements planned for the HAALSI study will allow the tracking of changes in various biomarkers with increasing age and with a changing environment, for example, in the context of high rates of HIV infection, famine, lifestyle changes, and greater access to health care. Through collaboration with the African Wits-INDEPTH Partnership for the Genomic Study of Body Composition and Cardiometabolic Disease Risk (AWI-Gen) Collaborative Center,3 which is part of the Human Heredity & Health in Africa (H3Africa) Consortium,4 we will have access to genome-wide data on genetic variation that can be analyzed in the context of the phenotypic data we will be collecting in the HAALSI Program.

"9457671","The etiology of many neurodevelopmental disorders including autism, schizophrenia and attention-deficit hyperactive disorder remains poorly understood. It is accepted that environmental factors may be involved and that the heritability of those conditions is relatively high. Numerous epidemiological and genome-wide association studies in affected populations have identified environmental factors and candidate genes increasing the susceptibility to those conditions. However, those genetic and environmental factors can only account for a small percentage of the clinical cases. This suggests that additional environmental influences remain unidentified, and that the majority of the heritable component of those conditions is of non-genetic origin.  We hypothesize that brain overexposure to thyroid hormone during development is an important factor contributing to both the environmental and non-genetic heritable components in the etiology of neurodevelopmental disorders. To test this hypothesis, we will use mouse models with genetic and epigenetic deficiency in DIO3, the main brain determinant controlling thyroid hormone action. In Specific Aim #1, we will determine what are the consequences of allele-specific inactivation of Dio3 globally or specifically in neurons for the brain programs of gene expression, adult brain structure and behavior.  In Specific Aim #2, we will profile the fetal and neonatal brain expression and the adult brain structure and behavior of genetically normal mouse descendants of ancestral mice that were exposed to an excess of thyroid hormone during development. We will compare the results of developmental gene expression in different parts of the brain with their adult behavior and with the altered epigenome of exposed ancestors to define which brain developmental programs, brain regions, brain functions, and related neurodevelopmental disorders that are affected by abnormal epigenetic inheritance originated in ancestral overexposure to thyroid hormones.  Based on the abnormal regulation of circadian rhythms that is typically associated with neurodevelopmental disorders and is also observed in mice lacking the Dio3 gene, we will identify the molecular and developmental basis by which developmental exposure to thyroid hormone excess leads to the abnormal programming of the circadian clock (Specific Aim #3).  We anticipate that our work will greatly advance our understanding of the etiology of complex neurodevelopmental conditions and demonstrate the breakthrough concept that a developmental excess of thyroid hormone influences the susceptibility to those conditions directly in the present generation and indirectly in descendants via epigenetic mechanisms of inheritance."
"9278789","Project 5: Multimorbidity?Abstract  There is considerable interest in understanding patterns, determinants and consequences of multimorbidity in aging populations, but relatively little research has been conducted outside of high-income settings. The population of sub-Saharan Africa is aging rapidly, resulting in a rising burden of multiple chronic conditions, with additional complexity derived from the high prevalence of HIV infection, especially in the era of increasing survivorship through antiretroviral therapy. As the population ages, conditions affecting cognitive function, notably Alzheimer's disease and related dementias, contribute further to a complex profile of multimorbidity. Multimorbidity likely has significant implications for physical and cognitive functioning, mental health, mortality risks, health service utilization and costs. The concept of frailty has been advanced as a way to characterize a consistent aging phenotype that combines indicators of health and functional status that are highly predictive of health decline and mortality, and the connection between multimorbidity and frailty is important to understand in organizing health systems and planning for both formal and informal care of aging populations. This project uses multimorbidity as an integrative lens through which to unify many of the major empirical observations in the study cohort, and to amplify important themes relating to social and economic drivers of health outcomes in aging populations that link all of the projects in the program. Our overall goal is to illuminate the role of multimorbidity at the nexus of a complex web of determinants, outcomes and consequences. Toward this end the project has four specific aims:  AIM 1: Develop a comprehensive portrait of the epidemiology of multimorbidity in a cohort of older South  Africans, including its prevalence and degree, its incidence and trajectory, and its patterns and determinants.  AIM 2: Evaluate the consequences of multimorbidity on mortality, physical and mental function, and well- being.  AIM 3: Assess the implications of multimorbidity for healthcare service utilization, effective coverage, and  health care spending.  AIM 4: Quantify the relationship between multimorbidity and frailty, and associated excess mortality risks,  and develop integrative measures of healthy life expectancy."
"9396973","Abstract Glucocorticoids are a common medication used to treat a myriad of inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. Their clinical use is limited by multiple side effects, the most common being hyperglycemia. Hyperglycemia has been shown to negatively impact disease progression, morbidity and mortality. Approximately 50% of patients taking glucocorticoids develop hyperglycemia, suggesting heterogeneity in this disease. Further understanding of who develops hyperglycemia may allow for prevention and earlier treatment such individuals. While the molecular mechanisms underlying glucocorticoid-induced hyperglycemia are not completely defined, there is evidence that the mechanisms of this disease mirror the mechanisms underlying type 2 diabetes (T2D). Glucocorticoid-induced hyperglycemia is thought to be caused by increased insulin resistance as well as decreased beta cell function. Our preliminary data suggest that genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of diabetes and insulin-related traits are enriched for glucocorticoid genes, further confirming the overlap between these two diseases. Therefore, we hypothesize that genetic risk scores for diabetes and insulin- related traits can be used to predict glycemic response to glucocorticoids. In Specific Aim 1, we will solidify the relationship between glucocorticoid genes and diabetes by investigating how T2D genetic variation is found in glucocorticoid genes. Specifically, we will do a gene burden test on glucocorticoid related genes to evaluate if sequence variation in glucocorticoid genes differs between subjects with and without diabetes. In Specific Aim 2, we will use a biobank resource to identify subjects with and without glucocorticoid-induced hyperglycemia. We will then construct genetic risk scores (GRS) for diabetes and insulin-related phenotypes. We will determine if there is a relationship between these GRS and the development of glucocorticoid-induced hyperglycemia. We will then leverage the newfound information found in Aim 1 to create a GRS of T2D-associated glucocorticoid-related genes. We will use this novel GRS to compare subjects with and without glucocorticoid-induced hyperglycemia. Thus, we will examine both if glucocorticoid-related genes affect diabetes risk and if diabetes-related genes affect risk of glucocorticoid- induced hyperglycemia. These aims reflect a carefully planned training program directed at advancing the scientific career of the applicant. Resources at the Broad Institute and the MGH Center for Human Genetic Research and the mentorship of Jose Florez, a leading expert in the field of diabetes genetics, will allow cutting-edge genomic discovery and advanced analytical approaches to be applied to investigate the genetic variants of glucocorticoid-induced hyperglycemia."
"9389344","CORE C: Abstract  The need for physiological assessments was generated by UC-TRaN faculty who required  electrophysiological studies beyond collaborations. These electrophysiological assessments  consisted of experiments performed in brain slices, acutely isolated neurons or in cultures,  providing a functional analysis of changes in neurons, local circuits and microcircuits induced  primarily by genetic alterations in cellular, mouse or rat models. The first objective of Core C will  be to continue these analyses because the need remains and the Core will assist investigators  with functional analysis at the cellular, circuit, and systems level using state-of-the-art  electrophysiology and optogenetic recording methods in in vitro and in vivo preparations.  Recent advances in both genomic and stem cell technologies, particularly hESC and hiPSC,  have opened the door to new approaches in IDD research based on human cells. For example,  cortical neurons harboring genetic mutations with a given disorder can in principle be readily  produced from hiPSC generated from patients. A significant challenge remains to translate this  promise into new discoveries about the basis of IDD and therapies. The second objective of this  Core will be to facilitate this process by assisting UC-TRaN investigators to produce, propagate,  and differentiate hESC and hiPSC into neural and glial cell types of interest to create in vitro  models of IDD. Another function of the Core is to work with investigators and molecular  screening resources available at UCLA to harness the potential of these in vitro models for drug  discovery."
"9379451","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our long-term goal is to advance the understanding, at the molecular level, of the pathogenicity and epidemiology of uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC) strains to better target treatment and prophylaxis of urinary tract infections, reduce resistance, and provide information on possible targets for vaccines and antibiotics. The proposed studies are focused on understanding the basis of urovirulence of E. coli by the comparative genome-wide analysis of strains that will be isolated from a large number of patients with first-time and recurrent cystitis and healthy women. The central hypothesis is that the relatively few clonal groups involved in UPEC human pathogenesis can be defined and characterized as to their key genetic loci and the impact of genetic variations on UPEC virulence. Our preliminary data support that we can investigate sizeable samples of fresh isolates, establish strong clonal associations with recurrent cystitis and determine genome- wide the pathogenicity-adaptive genetic changes. We will determine how mutational changes (single nucleotide polymorphisms, small insertions/deletions, etc) and horizontal gene transfer contribute to the emergence of UPEC. Our aim is to potentially examine every gene shared by at least a portion of UPEC strains for being under positive selection for pathogenicity-adaptive mutations or horizontal transfer. For this, we will employ a population genomics-based analysis to trace the mutations and gene transfer, followed by assessment of the functional significance of the representative positively selected loci in UPEC."
