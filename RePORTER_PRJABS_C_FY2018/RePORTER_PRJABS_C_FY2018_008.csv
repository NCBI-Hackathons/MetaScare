"9396160","Project Summary/Abstract Optimism ? a cognitive bias to overestimate positive future outcomes ? may play a critical function in the early years of life, driving how children learn, confront challenges, and persevere in the face of setbacks. Roughly 80% of adults make optimistically biased predictions, and although optimism is adaptive and provides motivational, social, and health benefits, virtually no empirical research has tested how optimism develops. Further, the lack of an optimism bias ? either presented as realism or pessimism ? is associated with depression in adolescents and adults, and may be driven by early life experiences. My objective is to develop an integrated and systematic framework for the development of optimism in preschool-aged children, focusing on the role of early experience (positive and negative) on these processes, and specifying connections between early optimism and depressive symptoms/negative affect states. Estimates are that 1-2% of preschoolers exhibit symptoms that meet the diagnostic criteria for Major Depressive Disorder, whereas 9-12% exhibit sub-clinical symptoms. Further, these prevalence rates are likely higher in children from disadvantaged backgrounds, and when considering negative affect more widely. My predictions are that optimism is present early in a broad capacity and influences how children learn from and about the world. As they experience event outcomes, and probabilistic reasoning improves, the magnitude of their optimistic predictions diminishes. Further, divergent developmental trajectories may emerge such that optimism declines more steeply in children who experience more negative life events, compounding the disadvantages they face. Lack of early optimism may also be a key symptom of depression in preschoolers and/or perpetuate symptoms over development. Recent data from our lab indicate that at least a subset of preschoolers do have an optimism bias ? they make optimistic predictions for events that concern themselves but not others ? providing initial support for these predictions. The proposed studies will test 3- to 5-year-olds from racially and socioeconomically diverse backgrounds to determine how early optimism is expressed and maintained, socioeconomic and family factors affecting optimism, and how optimism guides learning in typically developing children and those with elevated depressive symptoms. I introduce new experimental methods to test optimism, learning, and probabilistic reasoning in preschoolers, coupled with extensive parent reports on family background, children's experiences, motivational approach, parenting style, and an established measure of child depression. Experimentally, I will test if children offer optimistic, accurate, or pessimistic predictions for event outcomes, assess domain and state-related variability in optimism, and determine if children incorporate new positive, but not negative, information into their beliefs about how likely an event is to occur (as optimistic adults do). These measures will also be administered to preschoolers oversampled for elevated depressive symptoms. The comprehensive approach outlined here uses innovative methodology to answer critical questions about the development of optimism. These studies will elucidate the scope and developmental trajectory(ies) of the optimism bias in preschoolers, and whether early risk factors for depression link to decreases in optimism. The findings also have the potential to point to markers of early resiliency and inform cognitive-based preventive interventions."
"9445703","The emergence of pathogens that cause increased morbidity and mortality is a major public health concern. Clostridium difficile is a major cause of hospital acquired infection and is the leading cause of antibiotic-associated diarrhea. In the past decade, two epidemic ribotypes (RT027 and RT078) of C. difficile have emerged as major ribotypes in hospital outbreaks around the world despite not being observed at significant levels prior to the year 2000. These ribotypes are associated with increased morbidity and mortality and have been classified as hypervirulent. However, the mechanistic basis for why these strains began to emerge in the early 2000s is unclear.  We have found that RT027 and RT078 strains have acquired the ability to grow on the disaccharide trehalose more efficiently than other ribotypes of C. difficile. Our preliminary data shows that the mechanistic bases for the improved growth in these two ribotypes are genetically and mechanistically distinct, suggesting convergent evolution of improved trehalose metabolism in these phylogenetically distinct ribotypes. In addition, we have found that disrupting the ability of a RT027 strain to utilize trehalose dramatically attenuates disease severity, suggesting that trehalose metabolism contributes to the hypervirulent nature of RT027 and RT078 strains. Trehalose, a disaccharide of glucose, became a widely used food supplement after being granted GRAS status approval by the FDA in 2000 and EFSA in Europe in 2001. Trehalose has a number of desirable properties as a sugar additive due to the alpha, alpha 1-1 linkage that is heat and acid stable, which renders it 45% less sweet than sucrose. Normally found in foods such as mushrooms and shellfish, trehalose is now added to numerous food and drink products ranging from ground beef to ice cream.  The addition of trehalose to the worldwide food supply coincides with the first reports of RT027 and RT078 strains in the early 2000s, even though these ribotypes were present in hospitals as far back as 1985. We propose that addition of increased levels of trehalose to the food supply has selected for RT027 and RT078 strains due to their ability to more efficiently metabolize trehalose and has contributed to hospital epidemics. We will use two recently developed models in our laboratory, human fecal minibioreactor array model of C. difficile invasion and a humanized microbiota mouse model of C. difficile infection, to study the impact of trehalose and improved trehalose metabolism on the ability of RT027 and RT078 strains to cause C. difficile infection. We will also investigate the mechanistic bases for improved trehalose metabolism of RT027 and RT078 strains. Finally, we will assess what impact improved trehalose metabolism has on colonization dynamics, disease severity and carriage in animals of these hypervirulent C. difficile ribotypes. The following specific aims are proposed: Aim 1. Investigate the mechanism of how trehalose metabolism by C. difficile increases disease severity. Aim 2. Understand the mechanistic basis for improved trehalose metabolism in RT027 C. difficile. Aim 3. Understand the role of the acquired trehalose operon on RT078 fitness and animal carriage. We expect this work will establish a link between the recent addition of trehalose in the human diet and the emergence of epidemic C. difficile ribotypes. This will provide the first direct evidence of the alteration of the human diet directly impacting the pathogenesis of an enteric infection."
"9561431","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Parental lifetime exposures to perturbations such as stress, infection, malnutrition, and to advanced age have been linked with an increased risk for neurodevelopmental disorders in their children. While maternal insults during pregnancy can directly impact fetal development, the mechanisms by which paternal lifelong experiences can alter germ cell programming and affect offspring neurodevelopment are not known. However, transmission of these epigenetic marks to the next generation can significantly elevate disease risk, and if programmed into the germline can affect future generations as well. Using male stress experience as a model in which we can examine mechanisms involved in offspring neurodevelopmental programming, we found that paternal stress significantly altered offspring HPA stress axis regulation and reprogrammed the hypothalamus. Mechanistically, we identified 9 specific miRNAs in the mature sperm from stressed males that contributed to the offspring phenotype. Further, we were able to completely recapitulate the offspring phenotype by microinjection of these 9 miRNAs into fertilized zygotes. Using single-cell amplification technology, we were identified a novel role for these miRNAs to significantly affect post-fertilization embryo development, providing substantial evidence that sperm miRNAs are programmable by the environment and are able to transmit this information allowing for paternally directed embryo development. Therefore, our proposal will utilize our mouse model of paternal stress to examine: 1) the mechanisms whereby stress alters paternal germ cell miRNA that affect neurodevelopment and give rise to the offspring phenotype, 2) the transgenerational transmission of stress dysregulation to a second generation programmed by paternal stress and sperm miRNAs, and 3) the mechanism within the offspring brain that promotes the paternal stress phenotype through increased BBB permeability and repressive histone epigenetic programming."
"9551825","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In cancer, genetic heterogeneity is the focus of many investigations as it plays important roles in tumor progression and drug resistance by driving phenotypic diversity. Here, we consider another type of heterogeneity, one where natural cell-to-cell variability in protein levels in genetically-identical mammalian cells causes the same stimuli to yield different cell fates, such as life or death. We term this phenomenon natural phenotypic divergence (NPD). NPD can manifest as, for example, a persistent anticancer drug resistant subpopulation of cells, and understanding it is important for predicting cancer treatment efficacy. However, means to predict NPD from cell-based experiments have not been developed and are the subject of the proposal. We hypothesize that NPD can be predicted by characterizing how multivariate, endogenous protein expression noise is propagated non-linearly through signaling networks to regulate cell fate. It is the endogenous expression and degradation noise in the levels of multiple proteins within a signaling network that collectively manifest as NPD. We will test this hypothesis by combining experimental and computational approaches to examine NPD-based proliferation of non-transformed MCF10A cells. This proliferation is induced by combinations of epidermal growth factor, insulin, and cortisol and mediated by activation of the ERK, Akt, JNK, and SGK pathways. First, experimentally, we will use live-cell imaging approaches with FRET probes to measure real-time signaling network dynamics and proliferation simultaneously. Although we can only measure one pathway at a time, our subsequent use of computational, dynamic modular response analysis theory allows us to reconstruct how these pathways dynamically interact in a stimulus-specific fashion to control stochastic proliferation fates. Second, we will build a chemical kinetics-based, stochastic computational model that simulates how the protein expression variability underlying NPD propagates into signaling dynamics heterogeneity. Analysis of this model will suggest sets of key proteins whose collective, multivariate fluctuations have a large influence on NPD-based proliferation. Finally, we will measure fluctuations in the levels of these key proteins in single ive cells, use our computational models to predict whether these cells should proliferate or not in response to defined perturbations, and test the predictions by observing the actual proliferation decision in those same cells. We will test such predictions not only in standard 2D cell culture models, but also in the context of 3D culture acini formation. If successful, this would be the firt demonstration that the stochastic fates of individual live cells could be predicted based on biomarkers present prior to perturbation. This would be an important step towards identifying biomarker sets for individual patients and fashioning personalized therapeutic strategies."
"9380963","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): COPD is a leading cause of death in the US and worldwide and patients suffer high morbidity. A better understanding of contributing factors to the progression and burden of this pervasive disease is critical. Despite population-based epidemiological evidence suggesting exposure to ambient air pollutants causes increased hospitalizations and mortality from COPD, there is very little known about the impact of exposure to air pollutants on the progression of disease. For example, the extent to which exposure to air pollution accelerates lung function loss and contributes to patient-reported outcomes, such as quality of life and dyspnea in COPD remains largely unknown. SPIROMICS is a unique NHLBI-funded prospective cohort study of COPD phenotypes and markers of disease which plans to enroll 3,200 subjects at seven sites across the US. A subgroup of participants will also record daily symptoms over one year. We propose to add state-of-the art air pollution exposure assessment to determine individual-level outdoor and indoor air pollution exposure for all SPIROMICS participants, providing an extraordinary opportunity to understand effects of air pollutants on COPD morbidity and progression. For Specific Aim 1a, we aim to determine the impact of long-term outdoor air pollution exposure on COPD morbidity, including lung function decline, patient reported outcomes, and exacerbations by employing sophisticated spatio-temporal air pollution prediction models, supplemented with cohort-specific outdoor monitoring data, to precisely predict participants' ambient exposure to fine particulate matter (PM2.5), light absorbing or black carbon (BC), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx), ozone (O3), sulfur dioxide (SO2)) and link with existing health outcomes collected as part of the SPIROMICS study. For Specific Aim 1b, we aim to determine the effect of indoor air pollutants (PM2.5, NO2, NOx, SO2, O3, BC and secondhand smoke) on COPD morbidity by conducting indoor air monitoring in a subset of participants' residences. These data will be combined with validated questionnaire data collected on the entire cohort to model indoor exposure for all participants. Personal monitoring will be used to assess measurement error. For Specific Aim 2, we will determine whether short-term changes in outdoor air pollution are associated with day-to-day changes in symptoms and exacerbation risk in 300 subjects recording daily symptoms over a one- year period. For Specific Aim 3 we will examine airway macrophage black carbon content from induced sputum as a biomarker of air pollution (PM2.5 and BC) and determine its association with clinical and subclinical measures of disease severity and prognosis. Our study builds on an established network of investigators with complementary areas of expertise. Findings from this study can provide information to guide public policy and clinical management for individuals with COPD."
"9379848","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Epoxides are three membered cyclic ethers which can be toxic and mutagenic. They are degraded by enzymes known as epoxide hydrolases (EHs), which add water to epoxides to yield more water soluble diols. EHs are widely known for metabolizing xenobiotics, and this project advances our understanding of their fundamental structure, biochemistry and regulation. The soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) is the most abundant and active of the EHs in mammals, and it is largely involved in the hydrolysis of endogenous epoxides on natural fatty acids (EpFAs). Since EpFAs are powerful chemical mediators previously shown to reduce inflammation, hypertension, heart failure, and pain, their hydrolysis by the sEH can give rise to disease states. In this project we will test the hypothesis that the levels of EpFA and sEH are influenced by environmental factors, dietary status, and disease states. We also will test if decreasing sEH activity increases EpFA resulting in improved health. In Aim I, we will investigate the biochemistry of the sEH, as well as the microsomal EH (largely responsible for the metabolism of xenobiotics) and the newly discovered EH3. We will determine the relative roles of the sEH, mEH and EH3 in hydrolysis of bioactive EpFA. These biochemical and structural studies will allow prediction of the biological effects resulting from genetic alterations in human sEH. Anti-microbials in some hand soaps and some drugs are powerful inhibitors of the sEH while other environmental chemicals and drugs are powerful inducers. We will determine how these materials alter biologies regulated by the sEH and EpFA. Aim IIA is expanding analytical methods for regulatory lipids altered by disease states, environmental chemicals and drugs. These methods are being used to address the influence of environmental chemicals and nutrition on the sEH. The biochemical tools from Aim I and the analytical tools from Aim IIA will be used in Aims IIB-D to investigate how changes in the sEH and EpFA alter three separate biologies. In IIB we demonstrate that inhibition of the sEH blocks convulsions and reduces perception of inflammatory and neuropathic pain. With pain, inflammation and hypertension, we have shown that sEH inhibitors are more effective in the presence of epoxides of omega 3 rather than omega 6 fatty acids. With an increase in the use of omega 3 lipids as nutraceuticals and value added ingredients, an appreciation of their health effects is critical. We recently demonstrated EpFA from omega-3 and -6 precursors have opposite effects with sEHI on angiogenesis, allowing sEH inhibitors to reduce tumor growth and metastasis when combined with omega 3 EpFA (Aim IIC). This raises the possibly of new cancer therapeutics but cautions that omega 3 lipids could slow wound healing. Aim IID addresses how sEH inhibitors block hepatic fibrosis caused by carbon tetrachloride. We will test the hypothesis that there are common mechanisms underlying the largely beneficial biological effects of reduced sEH activity. The results of this project will illustrate the importance of man' total environment, including both xenobiotic exposure and nutrition, on health."
"9597999","PI: Brian Kobilka Structural Basis for Opioid Receptor Function Abstract of Research Plan The most powerful analgesic and addictive properties of opiate alkaloids are mediated by the µOR. As the receptor primarily responsible for the effects of opium, the ?OR is one of the oldest drug targets within the pharmacopeia. Opioid receptors are highly versatile signaling molecules. Activation of the ?OR results in signaling through the heterotrimeric G protein Gi, resulting in analgesia and sedation as well as euphoria and physical dependence. The ?OR can also signal through arrestin, and this pathway has been attributed to adverse effects of opioid analgesics including tolerance, respiratory suppression, and constipation. The ?OR has been the subject of intense focus for drug-discovery efforts over the past century, with the identification of numerous ligands of varying efficacy. These drugs occupy a wide chemical spectrum, from small organic molecules to a variety of endogenous and synthetic peptides. Recently it has been shown that drugs may differ in their ability to promote activation of the Gi or arrestin pathways, a property referred to a ?bias?. It has recently been shown that Gi-biased drugs such as PZM21, identified during the initial funding period, may have better therapeutic profiles than non-biased agonists such as morphine. The goal of research funded by this award is to provide structural insights into biased signaling that will facilitate our ability to develop the next generation of opioid analgesics with fewer adverse effects and less addictive potential. Specific Aims for the next period of funding (described in more detail at the end of the Progress Report) Aim 1. Determine the structure of an opioid receptor in complex with Gi. Aim 2. Determine the structure of the µOR bound to a G protein biased agonist. Aim 3. Determine the structure of an opioid receptor in complex with arrestin. Aim 4 . Characterize the effect of different ligands on µOR structure and dynamics. Resource Sharing Plan: We will share all materials generated during the course of our studies.

"9554080","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension (PAH) is a life-threatening disease that is significantly more frequent in HIV-infected individuals even with antiretroviral therapy. How HIV contributes to the pathophysiology of HIV-PAH remains unknown. HIV proteins are the main suspects but the exact mechanisms whereby these proteins influence vascular remodeling are unknown. HIV proteins like Tat, Nef and gp120 likely play a role in the pathogenesis of HIV-PAH. HIV gp120 binds to either CCR5 (R5) or CXCR4 (X4) chemokine receptors after interacting with CD4. Either CCR5 or CXCR4-ligand interactions promote inflammation leading to vascular remodeling in animal models of PAH. We have preliminary evidence that HIV-infected individuals with PAH harbor significantly more CXCR4-utilizing HIV variants (X4 viruses). While CCR5 signaling leads to PAH in SIV-infected macaques, our finding of an association between X4 viruses and PAH in HIV-infected individuals lead us to focus specifically on the contribution of X4 viruses to HIV-PAH. Furthermore, we found that HIV-X4, compared to R5 gp120, induces over-expression of the vasoconstrictive arachidonate 5- lipoxygenase (ALOX-5) gene in pulmonary endothelial cells. Hence, our research has uncovered X4 viruses as potential agents in the pathophysiology of HIV-PAH. Whether CXCR4 signaling in the presence of HIV X4 virus leads to PAH remains elusive. We hypothesize that HIV X4 induces chronic inflammation leading to pulmonary vascular remodeling and PAH via CXCR4 signaling. We believe that, in order to advance this field, it is imperative to first validate a model for HIV-PAH and examine the impact of X4 viruses on the pulmonary vasculature. Unfortunately, other than non-human primates, there is no HIV-PAH animal model that recapitulates the natural history of this disease. To test our hypothesis, we propose to validate the state-of-the- art mice engrafted with human Bone marrow, Lymph node and Thymus (hu-BLT) as model for HIV-PAH. APPROACH: We propose to: 1) characterize pulmonary vascular remodeling and right ventricular hypertrophy in HIV-infected hu-BLT mice, and 2) examine the functional role of CXCR4 signaling in pulmonary vascular cells exposed to HIV X4 virus in vivo and in vitro. SIGNIFICANCE AND INNOVATION: These studies are significant because our model will accelerate mechanistic studies on the CXCR4 signaling pathway that may allow for convergent mechanistic explanations for other forms of PAH, e.g. idiopathic and hypoxia-induced PAH, and will help explain why HIV patients are more prone to vascular diseases affecting other end-organs like kidneys and brain. In addition, we bring the innovative theoretical concept that CXCR4-utilizing HIV plays a role in PAH and pioneer the hu-BLT mouse to gain insights into HIV-associated pulmonary vasculopathy."
"9586026","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of this NCI K22 career development proposal is to develop the PI, a PhD, and trained social worker in health disparities, into a successfully funded independent cancer researcher. The proposal contains both career development and structured research plan activities focus on advancing cancer-health disparities research with incarcerated men. Incarcerated men have not generally been the focus of cancer health studies although multiple reports indicate that approximately 60-80% of inmates in the United States have histories of tobacco use, compared to 30% of the general population, and over 80% of individuals involved in the criminal justice system report histories of substance use, including alcohol, marijuana and crack cocaine. This is an alarming statistic, considering that tobacco, marijuana, crack cocaine, and alcohol use are associated with an increased risk of developing lung and liver diseases and certain cancers. Little is known about incarcerated men's cancer-health disparities and how incarceration affects their health behaviors upon release to the community. This program builds upon the PI's prior work including her strong background in HIV/AIDS research, clinical practice, and mixed-methods research experience. The specific career goals are: (1) to become proficient in research skills, focusing on advanced quantitative methods, data analysis and grant writing (enroll in cancer epidemiology and longitudinal research courses); and (2) to gain experience in prison cancer-health disparities research (collecting primary cancer- health disparities data across three different correctional facilities). The proposed research will assess the cancer-health disparities and smoking behaviors of men ages 18 years and over who are currently incarcerated in facilities of three different security levels (i.e., detention, minimum, and medium). The specific aims are to: (1) assess the knowledge, attitudes and beliefs about cancer and describe the smoking behaviors of incarcerated men; and (2) adapt the Cancer 101 (a cancer education resource to improve cancer knowledge, survival rates and cancer control in vulnerable populations) for incarcerated men in three different correctional settings. The results from the K22 described in this proposal are intended to inform the basis of a NCI R01 grant application. The long-term goal is to design and implement a culturally appropriate prison-to-community cancer-health prevention trial for incarcerated men returning to their communities in order to ultimately reduce the cancer burden affecting men with criminal justice backgrounds."
"9385285","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses) face extreme challenges as they adapt to both arthropod and vertebrate hosts. Arboviruses acutely infect humans and a wide range of other vertebrates, but must persistently infect one or two mosquito species for transmission to their next vertebrate host. Due to interhost cycling, arboviruses encounter vast differences in immune responses and RNA interference (RNAi), mediated by small RNAs. In contrast to in vertebrates, RNAi is the main antiviral response in insects, targeting RNA virus genomes for degradation to limit viral replication. Because of the disparate nature of RNAi in vertebrates versus mosquitoes, strategies for arboviruses to evade and subvert these responses should be equally divergent depending on the host. Therefore, we hypothesize that arbovirus:small RNA interplay will vary radically between mosquito and mammalian hosts. As a model arbovirus, we plan to study chikungunya virus (CHIKV), which causes a painful, debilitating illness, for which there is no vaccine or treatment. The main goal o this proposal is to understand CHIKV interaction strategies with disparate host RNAi components and responses. This work aims to advance our understanding of host-specific small RNA interactions with arboviruses, beginning with CHIKV.  Recently, we collaborated with the Darnell lab at The Rockefeller University to apply cross-linking and immunoprecipitation (CLIP) of Argonaute (Ago; termed Ago-CLIP) to virus-infected cells. Ago proteins are essential to all RNAi pathways, and are guided by small RNAs to bind to mRNA or viral RNA targets. Using Ago-CLIP, we can physically map small RNA-mediated Ago binding to viral genomes. This technique offers a unique opportunity to examine functional differences in host species' small RNA interactions with arboviruses. In our specific aims, we propose to use Ago-CLIP to map small RNA-mediated Ago binding to the CHIKV genome in both mammalian and mosquito models 1) in vitro and 2) in vivo, with special attention to interactions relevant to mosquito antiviral responses. Our understanding of arbovirus:host interactions is limited, particularly in mosquito vectors, and has been a major impediment to the development of antiviral control strategies. Our aims will allow us to identify critical CHIKV:small RNA interactions, which may uncover novel drug targets. Furthermore, observation of such small RNA interactions will increase our understanding of determinants of tropism and may inform strategies for disrupting arbovirus transmission. On a global level, systemic mapping of small RNA landscapes for arboviruses will yield insights into the interplay between viruses and antiviral defenses in disparate hosts."
"9113059","A pharmacologic approach to male contraception remains a longstanding challenge in medicine. Recent  research from our laboratories has provided pharmacologic target validation for BRDT, a detemiinant of  male fertility expressed in meiotic spemriatogonia. Using a chemical tool (JQ1) which targets the first  bromodomain of BRDT, we have demonstrated the feasibility of small-molecule modulation of male fertility  by targeting the male germ cell. Developed by the Bradner laboratory as an anti-cancer agent targeting  BRD4, an evolutionarily related protein and emerging cancer dependency in hematologic malignancies, JQ1  lacks the selectivity and drug-like properties befitting a male contraceptive agent. We therefore propose  research directed at the chemical optimization, biochemical characterization, mechanistic study and clinical  translation of BRDT inhibitors. Using structure-function insights regarding the molecular recognition of  human bromodomain proteins by natural ligands (acetyl-lysine containing peptides) and first-in-class  bromodomain inhibitors developed by our laboratory, we propose to develop focused libraries of BRDT  inhibitors using iterative cycles of synthesis and biochemical testing. Chemistry will proceed using three  distinct chemical scaffolds, to avoid inter-dependency in this research. To support this research, we have  developed robust, miniaturized biochemical assays for all BET bromodomain proteins. Beyond lead  optimization, the homogeneous assay for BRDT will be further optimized for high-throughput screening  within the Bradner laboratory and Institute of Chemistry and Cellular Biology, to maximize the opportunity for  discovering selectivity-conferring chemotypes. Based on successful drug development projects completed by  our group, we have organized a Project Management Plan, a Data Sharing Plan and a password-protected  common cloud computing site, to assure that deliverables in chemistry and biology are met, and that data is  provided to collaborating investigators in real-time. Pre-established criteria for the characteristics of a  chemical probe for BRDT have been established, guiding our research. Lead compounds will be studied in a  series of mechanistic studies of spermatogenesis in vivo, within the Matzuk laboratory. As the clinical  objective of this research is to deliver a prototype therapeutic BRDT inhibitor, advanced lead compounds will  be studied for phanmacologic properties in vitro and in vivo. It is expected that therapeutic agents will emerge  from this research, prompting human clinical investigation."
"9389517","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Apoptosis is critical for the maintenance of tissue homeostasis and for the maturation of various organs in the developing embryo. Failure to activate the cell death program results in embryonic lethality and severe central nervous system (CNS) defects, including hyperplasia of cells in the CNS, exencephaly (protrusion of brain matter from the skull), and incomplete neural tube closure. Although the apoptotic pathway has been well characterized in certain mammalian cell lines, exactly how cell death is regulated in primary embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and in the neural precursor cells (NPCs) of the CNS remains largely unknown. In this proposal, I will explore a novel apoptotic pathway engaged by ESCs and NPCs that primes them for rapid death in the developing embryo. This proposal will test the hypothesis that these cells utilize a novel C. elegans-like apoptotic pathway for activating caspases and cell death independently of the mitochondria. In particular, I hypothesize that, similar to what is observed in cells undergoing apoptosis in the developing C. elegans embryo, ESCs and NPCs express a previously uncharacterized short form of the pro-apoptotic protein, sApaf-1, that exists in complex with, and is inhibited by, the anti-apoptotic Bc-xL protein. In Aim 1, I will investigate how the sApaf-1/Bcl-xL interaction regulates apoptosis in ESCs and NPCs. Specifically, I will examine the physical interaction between sApaf-1 and Bcl-xL and determine whether Bcl-xL inhibition or knockdown is sufficient to allow sApaf-1 to activate caspases and induce rapid apoptosis in both cell types. Importantly, I will test whether this novel pathway in ESCs and NPCs induces apoptosis by bypassing the mitochondria as observed in the C. elegans embryo. In Aim 2, I will investigate the sApaf-1/Bcl-xL apoptotic pathway in the developing brain in vivo. This aim will explore the increased cell death phenotype of conditional knockout mice that are deficient in Bcl-xL in the developing brain, and whether the cell death observed in these animals can be rescued by simultaneous deletion of Apaf-1. The results from this proposal will be important for uncovering key features of ESC and NPC biology that determine how cell death is regulated in early mammalian embryonic development."
"9471192","Project Summary Virus-host interactions in the nucleus have long been recognized as playing important roles in determining the course of viral infection. Families of viruses with genomes composed of RNA (e.g. retroviruses and influenza) or DNA (e.g. polyomaviruses, papillomaviruses, adenoviruses and herpesviruses) interact with many of the same host cell pathways. Each virus family has also evolved unique strategies to create a nuclear environment conducive to viral gene expression and productive replication. Investigators studying RNA and DNA viruses often attend separate meetings, and this separation has limited our appreciation of the commonalities in modes of action. This proposal requests funds to assist in partial support of a conference entitled ?Viral Manipulation of Nuclear Processes? that will bring together researchers who work on both RNA and DNA viruses to discuss areas of common interest. The conference is sponsored by the American Society for Microbiology (ASM) and will be held at the Double Tree by Hilton Hotel and Suites in the Historic District of Charleston, South Carolina (3-6 December, 2017). This meeting follows three highly successful previous conferences on this topic held in Charleston, SC (2008), in Santa Fe, NM (2011), and in Washington, DC (2014). Outstanding researchers have been invited as speakers, as well as Keynote speakers who will give general interest introductions to fundamental issues of protein structure and signaling in the nucleus. All other presentations will be chosen for oral talks or posters from submitted abstracts. In this way we will ensure that the forefront of research is presented and will encourage participation of younger researchers. The Organizing Committee consists of established leaders from different areas of virology. They will be responsible for selection of speakers from submitted abstracts and choosing recipients of travel awards. A concerted effort will be made at every stage of the conference planning and organization to ensure inclusion of women and minorities. We request funds to cover travel costs and accommodation of junior speakers and provide travel awards for young investigators. This meeting is designed to explore emerging and novel types of host-virus interactions. It will emphasize how viruses alter nuclear architecture, modulate expression of cellular transcripts, manipulate DNA replication and repair machinery, and have evolved strategies to overcome host innate immune surveillance mechanisms in the nucleus. These are significant areas in virology that will provide new insights into viral pathogenesis. Topics will be addressed in five sessions: 1) Viral Manipulation Interactions with Nuclear Architecture, 2) Viral Exploitation of Host Pathways, 3) Viruses and Cancer, 4) Chromatin and Gene Expression, and 5) Host Factors and Countermeasures. The conference will provide a forum for discussion of topical issues confronting virology, and will foster new interactions, particularly between junior and senior investigators working on different virus families. We anticipate that the topics presented will stimulate collaborations across virology and promote exciting new approaches to advance human health."
"9423074","Project Summary Synaptic adhesion molecules (SAMs) are implicated in the formation, specification and maintenance of neuronal connections. Pathway analyses of mutations associated with neuropsychiatric disease implicate synaptic dysfunction as a pathophysiological mechanism, making SAMs important candidates for deeper functional exploration. Studies in humans suggest that Neurexin1? (Nrxn1?), a presynaptically-localized organizer of synaptic architecture, is a partially penetrant genetic risk factor for multiple neuropsychiatric diseases displaying altered goal-directed processing. We demonstrate that Nrxn1? mutants exhibit robust changes in how rewards shape future choices, and may provide a neural circuit framework for understanding inflexible and perseverative actions associated with many neuropsychiatric disorders. This proposal therefore employs genetic, viral, electrophysiological and behavioral approaches in mice to explore how Nrxn1? mutations lead to neural circuit changes capable of altering reward processing. Nrxn1? is widely expressed in brain, but exhibits peak levels throughout cortex and thalamus, sites whose extensive projections to striatum regulate reward processing. Using retrograde-transported viruses or region-specific Cre transgenic mice, together with our Nrxn1? conditional allele, we will ablate Nrxn1? from cortex, thalamus or projection neurons targeting specific striatal compartments. Mice will be tested in our goal-directed tasks to reveal neural circuits wherein Nrxn1? dysfunction precipitates reward abnormalities. To elucidate how these circuits are physiologically altered in Nrxn1? mutants, we will electrophysiologically probe the synaptic strength of cortical and thalamic inputs to the DMS. Preliminary results suggest enhancements in basal excitatory synaptic drive onto both DMS spiny neuron subtypes. Using optogenetic-mediated afferent recruitment and field-normalized synaptic efficacy measures, we will determine input-specific synaptic strength changes in Nrxn1? mutants. Furthermore, we will employ sparse infections of a fused channelrhodopsin-Cre virus into our Nrxn1? conditionals together with acute slice electrophysiology to permit selective recruitment of Nrxn1?-null terminals, thereby gaining mechanistic insight into the cell-autonomous anatomical and synaptic abnormalities caused by Nrxn1? loss-of-function. The mere presence of circuit-specific physiological changes in Nrxn1? mutants does not functionally implicate them in goal-directed dysfunction. To prove this, and broaden our analyses of Nrxn1? disruption to a circuit level, we will use viral-based techniques for activity modulation to see whether mimicking Nrxn1?-associated physiological changes in wildtype mice can produce mutant-like GDB performance or whether counteracting these physiological alterations in mutant mice can suppress the mutant behavioral phenotype. Together, the proposed work investigates how goal-directed neural systems are altered by the synaptic and circuit changes accompanying Nrxn1? perturbation, and may provide a foundation for understanding common circuit changes in reward processing - a key step for circuit-specific intervention."
"9397992","The overarching goals of Dr. Myers' research program are to apply exercise therapy and lifestyle intervention to help restore function, reduce disability, and reduce health care costs in Veterans with chronic disease. These areas include diagnostic and prognostic applications of cardiopulmonary exercise testing, and the physiologic effects of multidisciplinary rehabilitation programs in patients with chronic heart failure, coronary artery disease, abdominal aortic aneurysm disease, spinal cord injury, mild cognitive impairment, and chronic renal failure. He is currently PI on two VA RR&D projects, one entitled, ?PCI Alternative using Sustained Exercise (PAUSE),? and the other entitled, ?Exercise to Prevent Muscle Mass and Functional Loss in Elderly Dialysis Patients (PERFECT).? The PAUSE project extends his work on the clinical applications of rehabilitation in patients with cardiovascular disease. Cardiovascular disease remains the leading cause of mortality in Veterans, and in addition to assessing the physiologic effects of exercise and lifestyle intervention as an alternative to invasive treatment of coronary artery disease, the study addresses the cost effectiveness of non-invasive (lifestyle intervention) vs. invasive (coronary stenting) strategies. The PERFECT trial focuses on the effects of exercise therapy on muscle mass and function in chronic renal failure. Renal failure is an important condition in the VA because of its cost (estimated to be the second most costly condition in the VA), its prevalence (estimated to be 34% higher than the general population), and its devastating effects on physical function and disability. Dr. Myers current work also includes three funded projects involving the effects of exercise therapy in patients with mild cognitive impairment. These studies are designed to evaluate the effectiveness of exercise augmentation strategies along with cognitive training interventions to improve cognitive performance in older Veterans with mild cognitive impairment. Dr. Myers initiated and manages a relational database of clinical, angiographic, and exercise test responses dating back to 1987. This database has been a resource for answering many epidemiologic questions affecting Veterans (termed the Veterans Exercise Testing Study, or VETS). The VETS study is an ongoing, prospective evaluation of Veteran subjects referred for exercise testing for clinical reasons, designed to address exercise test, clinical, and lifestyle factors and their association with health outcomes. Studies from the VETS cohort have addressed the prevalence, temporal trends, and health care costs associated with statin use, obesity, chronic heart failure, cardiac rhythm abnormalities and other chronic conditions, and how these conditions are influenced by fitness and physical activity patterns. Analyses from the VETS cohort have influenced guidelines on exercise testing from major health organizations. He coordinates two other national data bases, a 7-center heart failure cardiopulmonary exercise test consortium, and the AHA/CDC- sponsored Fitness Registry and the Importance of Exercise: A National Data Base (FRIEND). The FRIEND initiative is designed to develop a national fitness registry in order to better inform clinicians and the public about the importance of physical activity and fitness and their role in the prevention of chronic disease. As Co-PI, he recently completed a 6-year NIH-funded Specialized Center of Clinically-Oriented Research (SCCOR) project entitled, ?Exercise Therapy in Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm Disease.? The SCCOR program was initiated by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute to foster multidisciplinary research on clinically relevant topics facilitating basic science findings to be more rapidly applied to clinical problems, with an emphasis on prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of a particular disease. This project has particular relevance to Veterans, since it has been shown that the prevalence of abdominal aortic aneurism disease in Veterans >60 years is 14.3%, with potentially lethal consequences if the disease is not treated."
"9594325","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): UDP-glucose dehydrogenase (UGDH) is a unique, essential enzyme with the central role of providing UDP- glucuronate, a rate-limiting precursor for plasma membrane hyaluronan synthesis, Golgi proteoglycan production, and ER-localized modification of hormones for elimination. Our laboratory has shown that insufficiency of UGDH contributes to loss of control of intracellular steroid levels, and dysregulated tumor cell growth rate in prostate cancer. It is not known how the cytosolic UDP-glucuronate is partitioned to its respective fates in the high levels needed for specifically timed product formation, nor how UGDH activity is controlled to limit competition with other pathways. Our hypothesis for this proposal is that hexameric and dimeric units of UGDH sense metabolic status of the cell and respond with increased or decreased enzymatic activity. Information for molecular sensing is conveyed partly through differential protein-protein interactions that occur upon exposure of the dimer-dimer interface. We will test this with two aims. Aim 1: Determine the functional outcome of specific UGDH interactions with components of the androgen elimination pathway. We will directly measure interactions of UGDH with hyaluronan synthase, the Golgi UDP-xylose transporter, and the ER UDP-glucuronate transporter, as the three proteins that mediate the demands for UDP-glucuronate flux. We will quantify UDP-glucuronate, steroid-glucuronide, notch glycosylation and hyaluronan production, which will respectively report overall UGDH activity, and functional distribution to the ER for androgen elimination, the Golgi for proteoglyca secretion, or the plasma membrane for hyaluronan synthesis. Aim 2: Characterize and validate the UGDH interactome using an unbiased approach. We will use mass spectrometry to identify proteins that differentially co-fractionate by size exclusion chromatography with our well- characterized hexameric and dimeric point mutants. As a complementary approach, we will identify proteins that cross-link with hexameric versus dimeric UGDH point mutants that incorporate a photo-activatable crosslinker as a non-natural amino acid. Validated interactions and/or post-translational modifications will be used to design strategies for selective partitionin of UDP-glucuronate to favor hormone elimination in future preclinical studies of prostate cancer."
"9397357","Project Summary  The overarching objective of this Research Proposal is to establish dihydrophenazine, phenoxazine and carbazole derivatives as organic photocatalysts (O-PCs) for visible light photoredox catalysis in the formation of challenging covalent bonds vital to synthesis of medicinally relevant molecules. This O-PC platform will expand the synthetic capabilities of chemists for drug development to improve the wellbeing of the society. These O-PCs offer many advantages over commonly used noble-metal based PCs such as Ru(bpy)32+ and fac-Ir(ppy)3: they are generally cheaper, non-air and -moisture sensitive and less toxic in comparison to their noble metal counterparts. Preliminary data suggests that dihydrophenazine, phenoxazine and carbazole O-PCs possess a wide range of excited state reduction potential [E0* = E0(PC?+/3PC*)] and ground state oxidation potential [Eox = E0(PC?+/PC)]. In fact, the classes of dihydrophenazine and phenoxazine O-PCs are more powerful excited state reductants than Ru(bpy)32+ and fac-Ir(ppy)3. Thus, through computationally-guided catalyst design, these O-PCs can be designed to possess desired E0* and Eox, which will be used in various covalent bond coupling methodologies to access a diverse array of medicinally relevant molecules.  Two specific aims have been tailored to achieve this overall goal. In Aim 1, a combined computational and experimental approach will be capitalized to realize classes of dihydrophenazine, phenoxazine and carbazole O-PC derivatives possessing a broad range of E0* and Eox. These O-PC families will provide organic and medicinal chemists the ability to match the E0* and Eox of the O-PC to the desired substrates in order to mediate selective bond activation and avoid potential side reactions. In Aim 2, tunable E0* and Eox of dihydrophenazine, phenoxazine and carbazole O-PCs will be exploited to forge challenging C-C, C-O, C-S, and C-N covalent bonds. These coupling reactions will introduce functionalities to medicinally relevant molecules such as pyridines, pyrroles, indoles and benzofurans. Realizing these two aims will convincingly demonstrate the applicability of dihydrophenazine, phenoxazine and carbazole O-PCs, thereby enabling the industrial-scale synthesis of medicinally relevant molecules through visible light photoredox catalysis."
"9554568","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)  Preterm birth, the leading cause of neonatal mortality in the United States, is also associated with a number of chronic health conditions and developmental disabilities that cause lifelong consequences. In Puerto Rico, the preterm birth rate is 17.7% of live births. At 50% above the U.S. average, it is the highest rate of any United States jurisdiction, below only Malawi (18.1%) globally. The researchers investigations suggest that the higher preterm birth rates in Puerto Rico cannot be explained by changes in obstetric practices, and that there is compelling preliminary evidence that exposure to hazardous chemicals contributes to preterm birth. Puerto Rico has 16 active Superfund sites and 200+ hazardous waste sites. Risk of exposure to contamination is high as many of these sites are unlined landfills that overlie Karst aquifers which present highly susceptible pathways for exposure to contamination.    PROTECT (Puerto Rico Testsite for Exploring Contamination Threats) brings together multidisciplinary researchers study the transport, exposure, health impact and remediation of contaminants, with particular attention to chlorinated solvents and phthalates commonly found at Superfund sites, as both suspect and model agents in the high to preterm birth rates in Puerto Rico. To do so, PROTECT uses an innovative, holistic, source-to-outcome structure, integrating epidemiological, toxicological, and analytical, fate-transport, and remediation studies along with a unified sampling infrastructure, a centralized, indexed data repository and a data management system. Administrative, research translation, training and community engagement cores engage and inform stakeholders, provide knowledge-transfer activities to the greater SRP and environmental health community, and provide extensive cross-disciplinary training. PROTECT is responsive to NIEHS, EPA and CDC strategic goals, and addresses priority areas identified by the Institute of Medicine Committee on preterm birth.    Since the Center's inception in 2010, PROTECT researchers have obtained significant and novel results indicating 1) extensive groundwater contamination in the northern Karst region of Puerto Rico; 2) potential mechanisms by which chemicals can stimulate preterm birth; and, 3) suspect chemicals that are elevated in the women in this study. The investigators have also developed a new environmentally-friendly technique for efficient decontamination of groundwater and an improved large-volume urinalysis technique. Research results have been documented in over 50 journal papers and 2 full patent applications. In addition, over 480 pregnant study subjects have been enrolled (200 of whom have completed their pregnancies), and over 70 trainees have participated in the Center. PROTECT will build on these successes with continued research and training to provide the much needed understanding of the role of hazardous chemicals and other environmental factors in preterm birth, and to develop new methods for contaminant remediation in Puerto Rico and beyond. This work will advance environmental health science in general, and potentially lead to a reduction in preterm birth rates."
"9444994","SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The gastrointestinal mucosa functions as an interface between the luminal contents and the underlying tissue compartments, and is thus vital in maintaining mucosal and systemic homeostasis. The gut lumen houses a numerically vast and taxonomically diverse prokaryotic microbiota. In health, the mucosa and microbiota thrive in a mutually beneficial symbiotic arrangement. Both host and microbe have evolved a complex system of mutual perception, response and reaction. These events are mediated in part by the ability of the intestinal epithelia to respond to specific members of the microbiota by the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), that serve to activate multiple cellular pathways involved in the maintenance of gut homeostasis. This proposal will employ in vivo systems including extensive use of germ-free mice, or mice gnotobiotically colonized with known ROS inducing bacteria. Additionally, taxonomic analysis of microbiota in neonatal mice will be used to identify other bacteria with functional effects on the gut mucosa. The proposal will study microbial influences on known and novel signaling pathway, and characterize the regulatory effects on gut survival, differentiation and proliferation. Our overall objectives are to define the participants, events, and processes involved in host microbial contact and how this interaction influences intestinal homeostasis, development and restitution. ROS and redox-stimulated pathways likely represent a conserved mechanism by which the host interacts with its commensal microbiota, and thus presents an attractive target for therapeutic manipulation."
"9590675","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Primary cilia organize signaling pathways such as vision, olfaction and the Hedgehog developmental pathway inside a specialized environment. The soluble contents and the membrane of the cilium are separated from the rest of the cell by diffusion barriers, thus endowing cilia with a unique physico-chemical environment. Depending on the status of Hedgehog signaling, specific signaling intermediates move into or out of cilia and it is predicted that the ciliary composition is modified by Hedgehog signaling. However, it has not been possible to assess the extent of the changes in the ciliary proteome upon Hedgehog pathway activation because cilia cannot be readily isolated from mammalian cells.  Dysfunction of primary cilia is the underlying cause of a collection of hereditary disorders named ciliopathies characterized by obesity, kidney cysts, skeletal malformations and sensory defects. Obtaining a catalogue of primary cilium proteins and comparing the ciliary proteome of ciliopathy to healthy cells would provide a rapid and effective way to characterize ciliopathies. Thus, proteomics of primary cilia is currently a major technical blockage in the discovery of novel ciliary mechanisms.  Rather than isolating cilia, we sought to attach the small molecule biotin to all ciliary protein by targeting a biotinylation enzyme to the primary cilium. This approach named proximity labeling has shown great promise in obtaining the proteome of mitochondria. We present promising preliminary data showing the validity of this approach for ciliary proteomics and wish to apply it to compare the ciliary proteome between different signaling states or between ciliopathy mutants and healthy cells.  The results obtained by comparative ciliary proteomics will provide unique insights into several important questions and generate testable molecular models. The proposal is intended to develop a promising technology and to serve as a stepping-stone towards a rapid and effective comparative ciliary proteomics platform."
"9529976","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Transfer RNAs (tRNAs) are essential biological adaptor molecules connecting mRNA to protein synthesis. Given their important biological role, correct maturation and modification of tRNAs is strictly required for cell health and viability. Ths is particularly salient in mitochondria, where mitochondrial tRNA gene mutations are the prevalent cause of mitochondrial disease. In organellar genomes, tRNAs punctuate rRNA and protein coding genes, making 5' end processing of tRNA transcripts essential not only for tRNA maturation, but also for the 3' end processing of the preceding sequences. Across all domains of life, tRNA 5' end maturation is catalyzed by the essential enzyme ribonuclease P (RNase P). Until recently all known RNase P enzymes were thought to include a catalytic RNA component. However, the discovery of Protein Only RNase P (PRORP) in human mitochondria and A. thaliana chloroplasts, mitochondria, and nuclei has shifted this paradigm. Correct tRNA maturation by PRORP is essential for human health; mutations in PRORP and its substrates that disrupt tRNA 5' end processing are linked to diseases including maternally inherited essential hypertension, mitochondrial myopathy, MELAS, and HSD10- disease. Our work will use biophysical, biochemical and cell- biological techniques to determine the structure and mechanism of PRORPs, as well as develop an in vivo model system for assessing the physiological role of PRORPs. These studies will establish a framework for understanding the molecular basis of, and ultimately treating, a range of mitochondrial diseases. Together, our highly interdisciplinary work will provide the first structural and mechanistic information on mitochondrial tRNA 5' end processing in higher eukaryotes."
"9405928","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Using neuroimaging techniques to find biomarkers of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and related social difficulties will allow for earlier detection of risk: a critical component of identifying which infants need preventive treatment. Neuroimaging may also offer a more sensitive method of predicting and assessing treatment response than focusing only on observable behavior. However, we first need to improve our understanding of typical brain development to identify neural markers that predict individual differences in social behaviors. These neural markers can then become targets for the study of biomarkers of ASD. Better understanding the neural differences associated with ASD and related social difficulties will help to guide the development of treatments that are closely matched to biological areas of deficit and provide promising regions of interest for studies utilizing neuroimaging to predict and assess treatment response. The current proposal is a multi-level (brain function and behavior), longitudinal neuroimaging study of 60 typically developing infants during a critical period in social development. The study will utilize functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) to measure brain functioning in response to both novel (live social interaction) and well-validated (biological motion) social stimuli at 6 months of age. Identified neural correlates of social stimui will then be applied to predict individual differences in key areas of social functioning in these same infants at 12 months. The applicant's overarching career goal is to conduct research that helps to prevent deficits in social- emotional functioning before they reach clinically impairing levels. The proposed fellowship training is an integral step in this career path. The applicant wil receive intensive training in developmental neuroimaging techniques under the mentorship of a leading researcher in the neurobiology of social cognition and ASD. This project, which combines clinical and developmental research using behavioral and neuroimaging techniques, will provide an ideal vehicle for the trainee to develop as an independent researcher in the field of translational developmental neuroscience, so that her research program can help bridge the gaps between social development, neural systems, and clinical research."
"9293611","Anticipated Impacts on Veterans Health Care: by identifying a colonoscopy bowel preparation regimen which is the most effective in real-world VA practice and can be immediately implemented on a VA-wide scale, the proposed study will maximize the effectiveness of colonoscopy in reducing colorectal cancer (CRC) risk among veterans, increase veteran satisfaction, and reduce VA healthcare cost. Background: CRC is a leading cause of cancer-related death among veterans. Colonoscopy can effectively reduce CRC incidence and mortality. However, non-adherence to screening colonoscopy substantially undermines this benefit. Existing evidence indicates that a disagreeable bowel preparation is a leading barrier to completing a colonoscopy from the patients' perspective. The taste and the volume of the bowel preparation determine patient tolerability and compliance to the preparation instructions, which in turn affects the incompletion (e.g., cancellation/no- show/reschedule) rate of scheduled colonoscopies as well as the effectiveness of the completed colonoscopies and patient satisfaction. The two most commonly used preparations currently in the US are the split-dose 4L polyethylene glycol (PEG) and the split-dose 2L MiraLAX/Gatorade preparations. While a high- volume regimen may in theory be more effective than a lower volume one, it may be associated with lower tolerability and adherence in real-world practice. Three small trials have compared these two preparations. However, data from these explanatory trials cannot inform policy decisions because they were conducted under artificial conditions, restricted among narrow patient populations, and most importantly not designed to capture the full impact of bowel preparation on the completion rate or effectiveness of colonoscopy. To address this critical knowledge gap, we are proposing a pragmatic trial to determine the optimal split-dose bowel preparation in the general veteran population. Objectives: to compare the real-world effectiveness of the two most commonly used split-dose colonoscopy bowel preparation regimens in the US (i.e., 4L PEG and 2L MiraLAX/Gatorade) with respect to the completion rate of scheduled colonoscopies, adenoma detection rate and secondarily preparation quality, cancellation/no-show rate and patient-oriented outcomes (e.g., willingness to repeat the preparation). Methods: the study will be a pragmatic randomized controlled trial comparing the two existing bowel preparation regimens in a large regional VA healthcare system. All veterans who are > 18 years of age and undergoing an outpatient elective colonoscopy are eligible. This pragmatic trial will be conducted with a waiver of informed consent. Providers who are ordering a colonoscopy at the point of care will be asked to choose between allowing the patient to be enrolled in the study or continuing with the current standard 4L PEG within the context of the VA electronic medical records (EMR) ordering menu. Enrolled patients will be automatically randomized through the EMR at the point of care to one of the two bowel preparation regimens, and a pre-populated order for the assigned preparation will then be presented instantaneously to the provider in the EMR for signature. Outcomes and covariates data will be collected directly from the EMR. The primary endpoints are overall completion rate of scheduled colonoscopy and adenoma detection rate, and the secondary endpoints are cancellation/no-show rate, bowel preparation quality and patient-oriented outcomes. Analysis will be based on intention-to-treat. We will also prospectively collect cost data in order to perform an economic evaluation of the two bowel preparation options."
"9379417","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Anxiety and mood diagnoses are chronic and devastating with respect to costs to the individual and the healthcare system, and are more prevalent than any other class of disorders. When these disorders present concurrently, the significant public health implications and societal costs are intensified. Despite high rates of comorbidity and underlying mechanistic similarities between treatment protocols, single disorder evidence- based psychotherapy protocols for these disorders have traditionally been recommended to treat emotional disorders sequentially. Moreover, when clinicians are presented with complex case presentations, they are often unprepared to treat them and move away from evidence-based approaches, potentially increasing the burden on the mental health system. The Unified Protocol for Transdiagnostic Treatment of Emotional Disorders (UP) is an innovative transdiagnostic protocol with promising evidence for successful treatment of emotional disorders, both for standalone and comorbid presentations, including the classification of not otherwise specified (NOS) disorders. To date, there have only been efficacy trials of the UP, which limit generalizability and do not address the larger public health impact and effectiveness in routine clinical care settings with both psychiatric and medical comorbidity. To address this critical limitation, the applicant proposes a pilot feasibility, acceptability, and tolerability study of the UP in patients with diverse psychiatric and medical comorbidity to manualized supportive therapy within a hospital. The deployment focused model (DFM) will inform design and statistical analyses. An additional aim includes determining the feasibility, acceptability, perceived fit and satisfaction of the UP in clinic settings through surveying and interviewing stakeholders in the system that are implementing the UP through the study. Consultation with stakeholders can minimize the time required to collect and assess fit within the larger system and, therefore, minimizes the time lag between science and practice in routine care settings. This study addresses an important public health concern by examining the effectiveness of the UP in a new population as a strategy for treatment of common and debilitating mental disorders in routine care settings. Furthermore, the proposed research aims will complement a comprehensive training plan to prepare the applicant to become an independent investigator with expertise in implementation science and effectiveness research. Results from the study will provide important information about whether or not this efficacious treatment can be effective, efficient, and ready for implementation in routine care settings in which psychiatric and medical comorbidity are common. This study will also serve as a model of deploying efficacious treatments into generalist clinics."
"9393775","Project Summary/Abstract  During sexual reproduction, the chromosome complement is precisely halved during meiosis to produce haploid gametes. The chromosome repair process called homologous recombination plays essential roles in meiosis. Recombination promotes chromosome pairing and mediates crossing over to create connections between homologous chromosomes that facilitate their accurate segregation. Defects in meiotic recombination are linked to infertility, pregnancy miscarriage, and congenital disease in humans. Although meiotic recombination has been intensively studied, the intermediate steps that include de novo DNA synthesis remain poorly understood. Recombination-associated DNA synthesis (RADS) is intrinsically difficult to characterize in vivo because DNA replication factors are essential for cell viability, and cell cultures lack the synchrony required to cleanly separate DNA synthesis during chromosome replication from that associated with recombination. RADS is predicted to be mechanistically distinct from the DNA synthesis associated with chromosome replication because it is primed by recombination intermediates and involves limited synthesis of single strands of DNA. This study will characterize the nature, function and mechanism of RADS during meiosis. These aims will be realized using a novel assay system in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae that exploits a combination of chemical and real-time genetic tools to allow essential replication factors to be inactivated at will in meiotic yeast cultures synchronized at precisely the point when recombination initiates. This will enable mutational analysis of RADS without perturbing the preceding chromosome replication. The first aim will characterize the role of RADS in meiotic prophase. The effects of generally inhibiting RADS on the efficiency of chromosome pairing and the DNA events of homologous recombination will be determined. The second aim will characterize the nature and mechanism of RADS by exploiting conditional alleles of essential replication factors created using the auxin-inducible degron system. Using this system, the components of the replication machinery will be systematically tested to delineate the factors required for meiotic RADS. Implicated factors will then be characterized in detail to elucidate the nature and mechanism of RADS. Together, these experiments will address a key gap in our understanding of chromosome metabolism and move towards a mechanistic understanding of the essential process of RADS. Given the conserved nature of meiotic recombination and the eukaryotic replication machinery, the results will be broadly relevant for understanding human meiosis. The sponsor/co-sponsor team, located in a world-class chromosome biology center, will implement a comprehensive training plan to furnish the applicant with training and skills in the following key areas: confidence and critical thinking through deep knowledge; advanced experimental and analytical skills; presentation and public speaking skills; writing and grantsmanship skills; and nurturing a network of colleagues and collaborators."
"9395761","Project Summary The myosin super-relaxed (SRX) state, first described six years ago, is emerging as an important player in muscle regulation and function, yet its mechanistic structure and dynamics have not been resolved. The goal of this proposal is to incorporate time-resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer (TR-FRET) with quantitative epifluorescence microscopy of fluorescent nucleotides, to detect and quantitate the SRX in chemically skinned skeletal muscle fibers from different disease mouse models. The long-term goal is to establish the role of SRX in age-related attenuation of muscle function, and use these insights to design therapeutic approaches. The population of SRX myosin in resting skeletal muscle is as much as 50%. These molecules are sequestered on the myosin thick-filament backbone and are thus auto-inhibited, catalyzing ATP hydrolysis about 10 times slower than purified myosin in solution, while generating no force. My proposal focuses on the role of SRX in the attenuation of muscle function with age, focusing on three independent but inter-related Aims: concerning the roles of sex-specificity (Aim 1), muscle thermogenesis and thus control of whole body basal metabolic rate (Aim 2), and metabolic diseases such as obesity and diabetes (Aim 3). Thus, the myosin SRX provides a platform for potential innovative treatments for obesity and diabetes. However, the molecular mechanism by which this SRX state affects aging muscle physiology and pathophysiology is unresolved. To solve this problem, my effort will be focused on applying site-directed spectroscopic probes on myosin to elucidate its structural changes as it undergoes transitions between the super-relaxed state and the normal relaxed state. The SRX can be rapidly mobilized into the normal relaxed or the active state in response to regulatory allosteric cues such as increased in cellular calcium, regulatory light chain (RLC) phosphorylation, and decreased temperature. These perturbations will be thoroughly tested on each proposed mouse model (Aims 1-3). This will be the first time that the molecular dynamics of SRX myosin will be directly studied through the physiological lens of aging and its associated metabolic disorders. Results from this work will provide crucial insights into the nature of the aging process on skeletal myosin and map a path toward novel therapies to treat diseases and extend healthy, active years of life by targeting myosin. The present fellowship proposal will also provide extensive training opportunity in muscle biochemistry, biophysics, and physiology, contributing to a meaningful MD/PhD degree. The training will prepare me to become an independent biomedical researcher with the means to apply optical spectroscopy to translational science, to both appreciate the molecular basis of disease and subsequent development of new treatments. This work aligns strongly with the mission statement of the NIA, by increasing the molecular understanding of the biological processes on aging along with fostering the development of a physician-scientist."
"9379453","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Immunization rates for recommended childhood vaccines have consistently been high, with childhood series completion near 80% by 19-35 months. However, these high immunization coverage rates do not fully account for delays or refusals of early childhood (i.e., less than one year of age) vaccine uptake. Overall, the proportion of children not receiving all recommended vaccines or whose parents are consistently limiting visit-level vaccine administration is increasing. Children who do not receive all recommended vaccines are at greater risk of contracting vaccine-preventable diseases, which can lead to development of severe sequelae, hospitalizations, and death. Additionally, despite evidence showing the effect of vaccinating pregnant women in reducing disease among infants too young to be fully vaccinated, maternal immunization rates remain low. We developed and pilot tested a novel, innovative, evidence based, and comprehensive immunization intervention at the Practice, Provider, and Patient (P3) levels to meet the diverse and complex information needs of mothers. This P3 intervention included components such as use of practice-level vaccine champions, expanded reminder-recall systems, and provision of practice-level immunization rate feedback (practice-level interventions); physician peer-delivered training related to vaccines, vaccine-preventable diseases, vaccination recommendations, and vaccination system logistics, as well as standardized talking points for use when recommendation vaccination (provider-level interventions); and an interactive tablet computer (iPad) education application for pregnant women to view while waiting for care (patient-level intervention). Our pilot testing found this P3 intervention to be well received by providers and patients and indicated a few areas where the intervention could be improved. In the proposed project, we will develop and evaluate an improved version of the P3 intervention, to be called P3+. Improvements to the initial P3 framework will be based on findings from the original evaluation project as well as additional formative research. We will then evaluate the P3+ intervention in a geographically and socio-demographically diverse set of obstetrician- gynecologist offices in Georgia (community-level practices) and Colorado (offices of the Kaiser Permanente Colorado managed care organization). The research will be led by Multiple PIs who have extensive experienced in understanding and addressing barriers to vaccine uptake. The proposed evaluation will address vaccine uptake both for pregnant women and for their children, through 24 months of age, to test the hypothesis that increasing acceptability of vaccines during pregnancy will lead to positive changes in acceptance of vaccines for children."
"9469986","PROJECT SUMMARY  Sepsis poses grave health concerns with no effective prevention or cure. The key stumbling block is the highly complex nature of the disrupted innate leukocyte homeostasis. Disrupted sepsis monocyte homeostasis is reflected in a dramatic early upswing of inflammatory processes followed by a late-phase compensatory tolerance. Disrupted neutrophil homeostasis in sepsis patients is cardinally represented by ?migratory paralysis? in which septic neutrophils lose migratory potential toward bacterial products while retaining migration toward sterile tissues, due to preferential reduction of FPR2 and induction of CCR5. Septic neutrophils also have reduced potential for generating neutrophil extra-cellular trap (NET). Collectively, these disrupted innate leukocyte homeostasis may compromise host defense and exacerbate multi-organ inflammation. However, mechanisms underlying monocyte priming and neutrophil paralysis are poorly understood. Due to their highly dynamic natures, current experimental systems in vitro or animal models in vivo fail to properly capture the disrupted leukocyte homeostasis. The PI?s past systems analyses with experimental and computational approaches reveal a model system that recapitulates the disrupted human leukocyte homeostasis in vitro and in vivo by applying subclinical super-low dose lipopolysaccharide (LPS). In sharp contrast to the effects of widely used higher dosages LPS which preferentially facilitate monocyte tolerance, Dr. Li?s lab documented that super- low dose LPS ?primes? monocytes for prolonged ?run-away? inflammation. In addition, Li lab observed that super- low dose LPS ?programs? neutrophils into a paralytic state, mimicking septic neutrophils with reduced FPR2, reduced potential of bacterial killing and elevated CCR5. Monocyte priming and neutrophil paralysis by super- low dose LPS can be observed in human blood leukocyte ex vivo. With the cecal ligation and puncture sepsis model, Li lab demonstrated exacerbated sepsis mortality in mice pre-conditioned with super-low dose LPS. Mechanistically, Li lab observed that super-low dose LPS potently reprograms monocytes and neutrophils by disrupting key homeostatic events and molecules. Based on these intriguing observations, the long-term goal is to understand the disrupted innate immune dynamics responsible for the elevated morbidity and mortality of sepsis. As a crucial first step, our key objective is to better understand the mechanisms responsible for the disrupted homeostasis in monocytes and neutrophils. This project plans to test the central hypothesis that monocyte priming and neutrophil paralysis during sepsis are caused by the disruption of key homeostatic molecules and processes. Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that the disruption of homeostatic molecules such as RelB is responsible for the monocyte priming conducive for increased sepsis mortality. Aim 2 will reveal the fundamental cellular and molecular mechanisms responsible for neutrophil paralysis. Aim 3 will test whether that alteration of leukocyte dynamics may exacerbate, while restoration of leukocyte homeostasis may attenuate sepsis pathogenesis."
"9463136","Abstract  The innate immune system forms the first line of specific host defense against invading microbial pathogens. Integral to the innate immune response are Pattern Recognition Receptors (PRRs), which recognize conserved determinants expressed by a broad range of pathogenic microorganisms. Among these are the Toll-like receptors, which promote inflammatory signaling and phagocyte recruitment in response to pathogen recognition, and several families of phagocytic PRRs that mediate phagocytic clearance of microbes from infected tissues. Each receptor family contains multiple members that recognize a unique spectrum of microbial components, and collectively they provide protection against a wide range of infectious organisms.  We have identified a novel pattern recognition receptor, BAI1, that specifically recognizes the surface lipopolysaccharide (LPS) of Gram-negative bacteria. BAI1 is a member of a poorly understood family of G- protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), the so-called Adhesion GPCRs. Binding of bacteria to BAI1 triggers their rapid internalization and killing by host phagocytes, through a mechanism involving activation of the small GTPase Rac by the Elmo/Dock GEF complex, which interacts directly with BAI1. Whether and how signaling through heterotrimeric G proteins is integrated into this process is not known, and will be the focus of Aim 1.  An emerging theme in innate immunity is that pattern recognition receptors often cooperate with each other to enhance downstream signaling responses. Our published and preliminary data indicate that BAI1 acts in tandem with the Toll-like receptor TLR4 to promote the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by phagocytic cells, and the synthesis of a subset of inflammatory cytokines/chemokines/interferons whose expression is mediated by the transcription factor IRF3. In Aim 2 we will determine how signals derived from BAI1 influence TLR4-mediated signaling to drive ROS production and the transcription of pro-inflammatory genes.  The ultimate goal of the proposed research is to define the role of BAI1 in host defense against bacterial infection. In Aim 3, we will characterize the ability of BAI1-deficient macrophages and neutrophils to clear infection in a mouse model of Gram-negative peritonitis. The ability of BAI1 to drive ROS production and cytokine/interferon synthesis in specific myeloid cell subsets during infection will also be determined. Together these studies will provide unique biochemical and physiological insights into a new class of pattern recognition receptor with important functions in the innate immune response to bacterial pathogens. Moreover, BAI1 is one of the few Adhesion GPCRs with known physiological ligands, and dissection of its signaling properties will reveal new insights into this poorly understood class of receptors."
"9470126","PROJECT SUMMARY  Repetitive satellite DNA is a major component of most eukaryotic genomes, including humans. Satellite DNAs can exist as selfish genomic parasites that propagate in the genome at the expense of the host, or, alternatively, may form essential chromosome structures including centromeres, which ensure proper chromosome separation during cell division, and telomeres, which protect the ends of chromosomes from degradation. Despite participating in these essential structures, satellite DNA sequences differ widely in sequence and abundance in the genome, even between closely related species. Molecular and theoretical models exist to explain how and why repetitive DNA shows such rapid evolution. However, few studies test these models using genome-wide data because the repetitive part of the genome is difficult to accurately sequence and measure with current technology. It is important to understand how repeats vary across populations, how and why they change over time, and their underlying genetic determinants because they are associated with diseases affecting human health including cancer, differences in immunity, and premature aging. To understand the evolutionary processes behind and the genetic basis of repeat variation, experimental systems are needed in which variation in satellite DNA has been documented across populations and species and can be assayed for phenotypic effects. Drosophila melanogaster has been a workhorse of genetic research for over a century and genomic short-read datasets are readily available for over 1000 lines of D. melanogaster and ~50 lines of three closely related species. I propose to harness the power of these genomic resources to study the evolutionary dynamics and genetic basis of satellite DNA. First, I will assay this dataset for satellites using a customized software pipeline that accounts for GC-bias, currently a major confounding factor in accurate assessment of genome-wide satellite abundance in short-read data. Second, I will use this data to inform tests of two hypotheses for rapid satellite turnover: neutral evolution and selfish transmission. If satellites are evolving neutrally, then variation across populations and species should correlate with divergence in a comparative analysis. If satellites are evolving rapidly due to selfish transmission, then I will detect significant deviations from Mendelian genotype ratios in backcrosses between D. melanogaster lines that differ in satellite content. Finally, I will investigate the genetic basis for satellite abundance using genome- wide associations (GWA), both for individual sequences and satellites in aggregate. If satellite abundance has a simple genetic basis, then GWA analysis will show significant associations with only a few genetic variants. This work will set the standard for detection and assessment of satellite DNA in short-read datasets, provide insight into modes of genome-wide satellite evolution, estimate the strength and frequency of selfish transmission, and generate candidate genes associated with satellite abundance, thus enabling a major advance in our understanding of the evolutionary dynamics and genetic determinants of satellite DNA."
"9099529","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):      Cardiovascular (CV) event prevention (e.g., myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accident) remains the single most important public health problem in the United States, and cardiovascular disease is a leading cause of death among VA users. Improving the provision of prevention services is a primary focus of the Secretary's New Models of Care Transformational Initiative. However, prevention has been challenging to achieve. Multifactorial behavioral interventions are effective in treating a number of chronic illnesses (e.g., hypertension, diabetes), but less is known about their ability to reduce risk among patients without a unifying chronic illness. Group visits are an efficient, effective strategy for delivering a multifactorial behavior change intervention; the VA is committed to the group visit strategy to address a wide array of primary care problems.  Groups have been shown to be an effective means of improving a number of outcomes in a number of individual diseases, but, again, their role in cardiovascular prevention among patients without a single common illness is unknown. Coaching is a type of multi-factorial behavioral intervention that involves goal-setting, and working to overcome barriers to behavior change. Coaching can be performed one-on-one, but coaching interventions have been delivered in group settings. We have shown, in a 150-subject RCT, that group coaching plus individualized telephone coaching reduces cardiovascular risk, but the population in that study was very different from typical VA users.   We propose a three-site, two-arm randomized trial measuring the effectiveness of a group prevention coaching (GPC) intervention in improving cardiovascular risk, compared to VA usual care. The study will be performed at the Durham, Buffalo, and Syracuse VAMCs. Each arm will have 200 patients; patients will be VA users without prior history of cardiovascular event, but with at least 5% risk of such an event, and with either inadequately controlled hypertension or dyslipidemia, or current smoking. The GPC intervention will focus on changing a behavior of the patient's choice that is likely to lead to improvements in cholesterol, blood pressure, or to smoking cessation. Behaviors that will be reinforced will include but not be limited to healthy eating, decreased caloric intake, increased physical activity, stress reduction, and participatory decision making with physicians. Barriers to these behaviors will be identified. The coach in both intervention arms will adopt a problem-solving approach to overcoming the above barriers and reinforcing the above behaviors; problem- solving is a well-described framework for behavior change. The GPC coach/interventionist for will be either the  facility's Health Behavior Coordinator (HBC) or a  person hired for the research enterprise but trained and  credentialed identically to an HBC.   All  outcomes will be obtained at baseline and 6 months after enrollment by blinded research personnel.  The primary outcome will be change in 10-year risk of fatal coronary event or non-fatal MI 6 months after enrollment, as measured by Framingham Risk Score. Key secondary outcomes will include dietary content by Food Frequency Questionnaire (26), physical activity as measured by International Physical Activity Questionnaire (27), and weight. We will also determine if group cohesion, as measured by the Group Dynamics Inventory (28), influences the effectiveness of GPC. We well also assess whether time spent in contact with a coach influences the effectiveness, by database log-in timekeeping strategies."
"9468687","Project Summary/Abstract This proposal seeks to reveal the underlying structural mechanism of consensus hyperactivation of the nuclear receptor (NR) ROR? driving maximal transcriptional output of target genes. To achieve this goal, I will perform detailed mechanism of action studies on a range of novel synthetic agonists of ROR? to further our understanding the molecular mechanism driving their ?functional selectivity? and to evaluate the physiological role of ROR?. I hypothesize that ligand-dependent structural perturbations manipulate coregulator interactions and PTM status of the receptor to directly influence gene program regulation. I aim to correlate structure based measurements and proteogenomic studies with biochemical and biological activity of synthetic agonists for ROR? and contrasting this to results obtained using repressive antagonist/inverse agonist ligands. ROR? agonists have already been developed with various potencies, binding modes, and receptor activation potential in cell based assays7,8. To accomplish the goals of my research project, I propose the following specific aims. Aim 1: Develop a comprehensive structural model for ligand activation of ROR?. I will perform structure determination of agonist-LBD complexes via X-ray co-crystallography and will determine ligand-dependent perturbation in receptor plasticity with hydrogen/deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDX-MS). As a proxy for receptor conformation, a coregulator interaction screen will be developed to determine ligand effects on specificity and affinity for coregulator recruitment. Crosslinking coupled with mass spectrometry (XL-MS) and HDX-MS will be conducted to quantitate ligand-dependent effects on LBD conformation ensembles and coregulator interactions as well as determining specific NR box motifs receptor interactions. These comprehensive biophysical measurements will be used to cluster compounds with similar properties where the functional consequences of these structural perturbations will be determined in Aim 2. Aim 2: Validation of structural model in cultured cells in vitro and ex vivo for ROR? agonists. Agonist activity in cultured cells will be characterized in relevant systems by expression profiling of ROR? target genes and coregulator associations using rapid immunoprecipitation mass spectrometry of endogenous proteins (RIME). The murine T lymphoma EL4 cell line will be used for initial compound screening by monitoring transcript modulation. This system will also be used to develop RIME methodology. Induced T helper 17 cells (iTH17) will serve as a more physiologically relevant system for agonist characterization. iTh17 target gene programs and coregulator perturbations will be determined by RNA-seq and RIME, respectively. Co-immunoprecipitation with western blotting and chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments will be conducted to confirm findings from RIME."

"9394537","Project Summary This application describes a 3-year training plan that will enable me, a psychologist with a background in emotion and decision-making, to initiate cognitive neuroscience research on decision-making in older adults. Supervised by experts in neuroeconomics (Dr. Kable) and episodic memory and aging (Dr. Wolk), this proposal examines how episodic memory contributes to intertemporal choice, focusing on a population with substantial variability in episodic memory decline: older adults with and without preclinical levels of Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology. When making choices between outcomes realized at different times (intertemporal choices), people prefer rewards sooner rather than later, often even when the delayed reward is larger. This tendency, temporal discounting, varies widely across individuals and contexts. Determining the neural mechanisms that underlie intertemporal preferences is important because overly myopic choices can be detrimental to people's health and well-being. The proposed experiments aim to address two major gaps in the literature on temporal discounting. First, research on intertemporal choice in older adults has yielded inconsistent results, suggesting that variability in cognitive decline among older adults may contribute to variability in these preferences and/or that the presence of preclinical levels of AD pathology, often unaccounted for in studies of aging, may influence this decision process. Second, there is evidence that the episodic memory system plays a role in promoting more patient choice, but the mechanism by which this occurs is unclear. Given the evidence of episodic memory decline in older adults, this proposal is well- positioned to tackle both of these questions. The first aim is to measure neuroanatomical and behavioral correlates of episodic memory and relate these to temporal discounting in a large sample of primarily older adults. Neuroanatomical correlates will comprise: gray matter volume in medial temporal lobe (MTL), tissue density in MTL, and white matter tract integrity between MTL and ventromedial prefrontal cortex. Behavioral correlates include vividness of episodic memory recall, assessed with the Autobiographical Memory Interview. In the same dataset, the second aim compares temporal discounting between the subset of older adults with preclinical AD (20-30%; assessed with amyloid PET imaging) and those without it. Since pathological substrates of AD include critical nodes of the memory network, we expect that differences in temporal discounting between these groups might be mediated by MTL structure differences. The third aim manipulates episodic memory prior to intertemporal choice in middle-aged and older adults and investigates (using fMRI) the neural mechanism by which memory retrieval impacts choice. We expect that retrieving positive autobiographical memories will reduce temporal discounting, most likely through interactions between episodic memory and valuation regions. The proposed research will contribute to our understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying intertemporal choice, and it may inspire novel interventions for fostering patient choice."
"9598305","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):      While ongoing research has suggested there are disabilities associated with mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) and with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), few imaging studies have examined the impact of their co- morbidity in Operation Enduring Freedom-Operation Iraqi Freedom-Operation New Dawn (OEF-OIF-OND) Veterans. Ragsdale et al (2013) have reported both increased PTSD symptoms and functional impairments in a group of Veterans suffering from both mTBI and PTSD, relative to a group of Veterans with PTSD alone. Yet even less research is concerned with the recovery these Veterans experience from treatment. The overarching goal of the present study is to investigate the global functional, psychological, and neural network recovery of the OEF-OIF-OND Veterans with this co-morbidity. Specifically, we propose to investigate changes in OEF-OIF-OND Veterans with both PTSD and mTBI who participate in a meditation intervention designed for Veterans (Inner Resources for Veterans; IRV). First we propose that IRV will be associated with improvements in community integration and quality of life. Secondly, we propose that Veterans completing a course of IRV will experience improvements in PTSD and postconsussive, including depressive, symptoms. Finally, we seek to show that practicing IRV meditation will improve functional connectivity in OEF-OIF-OND Veterans with co-morbid mTBI and PTSD. We believe that this proposal will not only help us define the problems of Veterans with co-morbid mTBI and PTSD more clearly, but also shed light on their potential for recovery afforded by effective treatment."
"9478515","Project Summary/Abstract: Though the State of Alaska Food Safety & Sanitation Program has made significant progress toward full conformance with all 10 elements of the Manufactured Food Regulatory Program Standards (MFRPS), due several factors, including significant program reorganization, staff turnover, development of a new information management system, and changes to the MFRPS, the program continues to work diligently to achieve full conformance with some unmet standards and maintain conformance with the standards already met. Through Alaska's implementation of a new information management system (IMS) designed specifically with the overarching goals of standards achievement and data sharing across jurisdictions in mind, the program has reevaluated its procedures, forms, and workflows, a process that has been beneficial and will result in greater efficiencies and programmatic effectiveness, but requires revisions to various aspects of the program's current system. Additionally, the program held off in developing certain protocols, including some relating to quality assurance, instead prioritizing development of this critical IMS because of the recognition that this IMS will be invaluable in integrating data analyses with the development of programmatic priorities, thereby sustaining conformance and improving public health outcomes. Alaska's strategic plan builds on the program's current capacity, identifying tasks expected to be completed by the end of the one year cooperative agreement in order to achieve conformance with the standards it has not yet met and improve its ability to prevent, mitigate, and respond to foodborne illness. The plan focuses on the continued development and enhancement of the IMS (in particular, those functionalities that facilitate the systematic and effective integration of quality assurance and compliance data reviews), the development and revision of related protocols, and the performance of ongoing work to sustain conformance with standards already met.

"9465496","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Growing biochemical evidence suggests that cell membranes segregate their components into nanoscopic platforms or 'rafts' to control signaling and trafficking across the membrane. Signaling is a key function of the cell, and it is unsurprising that raft formation has been proposed to influence a wide range of diseases, such as Alzheimer's, influenza, and diabetes. This project will shed further light on this issue by accomplishing 3 different aims. The development of a new microscopy technique capable of imaging membranes at nanometer scale and microsecond times- The limiting factor in current studies of lipid rafts is the limits of current imaging techniques. The characterization of model membranes at the nanoscale- Model membranes, composed of a just few components, will provide valuable information on the lipid interactions that drive the formation of lipid rafts Imaging live cells- Live cells will be imaged, and their nanoscale membrane structure correlated to the position of proteins known to associate with rafts. This will provide information on the actual behavior of cell membranes in organizing proteins. This project will answer questions about how cells are organized that will have immediate impact on the understanding of many diseases. This project will also develop tools that will enable many future experiments on how disease affects the functioning of a cell."
"9566371","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal describes a five-year training program for the development of a career in clinical research, focused on improving the quality of cardiac catheterization in children. This proposal is will serve as a vehicle to developing into an independent investigator. To that end, we have established a training plan that includes mentoring, course-work, didactic educational activities, and hands-on research. Steven Kawut, MD, MS, (the primary mentor) is a tenured Associate Professor of Medicine and Epidemiology. He has a track record of successfully mentoring fellows and junior faculty and holds a K24 to support his mentoring activities. An advisory committee has been assembled to guide the candidate's career development.  The application focuses on three specific aims. First, metrics to compare the outcomes of catheterization laboratories in different centers have not been defined. We have demonstrated that death and other catastrophic outcomes are significantly associated with procedural volume. However, the association between procedural volume and less severe adverse events was much less strong. We propose to study the association between procedural volume and risk of failure to rescue (i.e., the ability to avoid catastrophic outcome given an adverse event), and in so doing introduce it to as a novel outcome measure in the field. We propose to leverage a multi-center clinical registry, the IMproving Pediatric and Adult Treatment (IMPACT) registry to accomplish this aim.  Second, economic cost is not only a surrogate marker of clinical outcome, but also an independent measure of the efficiency of healthcare delivery. We propose to establish benchmarks for the economic cost of catheterization procedures, and to study the factors influencing cost. To accomplish this aim, we will use a multi-center administrative database, the Pediatric Health Information System (PHIS) database.  Third, patient-reported outcomes, such as health-related quality of life (HR-QOL) represent an important aspect of health that is not captured in traditional physician reported outcomes (and moreover are not included in multicenter registries and databases). They also represent an important aspect (along with cost) of comparative effectiveness research. We propose to perform a single center cohort study of children undergoing catheterization to define the effect of cardiac catheterization on HR-QOL, and to determine the factors (modifiable and non-modifiable) that influence it.  Together, these three aims illuminate different outcomes associated with cardiac catheterization in children. By combining these novel techniques, the applicant hopes to begin to define the factors that influence health and well-being of children undergoing catheterization and set the groundwork for studies that will test interventions to improve the quality of care for children requiring cardiac catheterization."
"9392842","PTSD affects approximately 14% of OEF/OIF Veterans and leads to considerable personal and societal costs (e.g., increased morbidity, reduced work productivity, poorer relationships). Although cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is one of the most effective treatments for PTSD, a substantial portion (approximately 50%) of individuals drop out prematurely, do not respond to treatment, or relapse. Treatment engagement is worse for OEF/OIF Veterans, who attend fewer sessions and have higher dropout rates than civilians and Veterans from other eras. One likely barrier to treatment engagement and effectiveness is the executive functioning problems present in individuals with PTSD. Executive functions (EFs) are the set of higher-level cognitive skills that organize and integrate lower-level cognitive processes in order to perform complex, goal-directed tasks. PTSD has been associated with EF deficits, including impairments in inhibitory control, working memory, and cognitive flexibly, as well as dysfunction in a network of brain regions that support EFs (e.g., prefrontal cortex [PFC], cingulate). EFs are essential for CBT in order to engage the cognitive skills involved in treatment (e.g., self-monitoring, inhibiting distorted thoughts, flexibly generating/evaluating alternative thoughts). This is particularly true for Cognitive Processing Therapy (CPT), a frontline CBT treatment for PTSD, which involves identifying and challenging maladaptive trauma-related thoughts to alter their impact on emotions and behavior. Thus, EF deficits may lead to reduced CPT engagement and responsivity. In fact, worse EF at baseline has been associated with poorer response to CBT in several disorders (e.g., generalized anxiety disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder, schizophrenia). Further, a study of brain functioning during an EF task demonstrated that dysfunction in EF-related brain regions including PFC and cingulate cortex at baseline predicted nonresponse to CBT for PTSD.  Directly targeting EF prior to CPT via cognitive training would strengthen executive networks and likely boost treatment effectiveness, allowing Veterans to fully engage in and benefit more from components of CPT (e.g., cognitive restructuring). Evidence suggests that computerized cognitive training improves EF and functioning in EF-related brain regions, increases mental health treatment completion rates, and enhances response to CBT, though this has not yet been tested in a PTSD population. Thus, the main goal of the proposed study is to examine whether administering computerized EF training (CEFT) immediately prior to CPT will improve executive functioning and enhance treatment adherence, completion rates, and psychological and functional outcomes in OEF/OIF Veterans with PTSD. Objective (neuropsychological) and subjective (self- report) measures of EF will be collected to determine if CEFT enhances EF and if this in turn mediates the relationship between treatment condition and PTSD symptom improvement. Functional neuroimaging during EF tasks will also be collected at baseline to determine whether functioning within an EF network predicts treatment response, above and beyond traditional paper-and-pencil measures of EF. Veterans (N=110) will be randomized to either 12 weeks of CEFT-CPT or a placebo word training condition plus CPT. Assessments will be administered at baseline, immediately after CEFT or word training (prior to CPT), and after CPT completion.  The proposed research aims to reduce barriers to treatment engagement and has potential to significantly enhance current treatments for PTSD by combining cognitive and psychotherapeutic approaches. Targeting EF directly and independently represents a logical, innovative, and empirically-informed method for augmenting existing treatments for PTSD in order to optimize outcomes. Findings from the proposed study will not only directly inform clinical practice, but also have the potential to significantly improve the quality of Veterans? lives, reduce societal costs and burden, improve access to care, and reveal ways to better match individuals with treatments they are most likely to benefit from."
"9597412","Chronic musculoskeletal pain creates a significant public health burden, and Veterans are disproportionately affected. The frequency and extent of co-occurrence of pain and PTSD, pain and Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI), all three conditions (Post-deployment Multi-symptom Disorder (PMD), and other multi-symptom syndromes can complicate and reduce the effectiveness of pain treatment. Furthermore, the majority of Veterans do not seek care in VA settings, requiring an approach that will be available to all Veterans. The Blueprint for Relieving Pain in America and National Pain Strategy call for the promotion of self-management; reducing disparities among vulnerable subgroups (e.g., Veterans); and the tailoring of pain care. Proponents of integrated treatment for common co-morbid conditions are advocating for interventions that address multiple conditions. This Phase II proposal builds on a successful NACTS-funded Phase I SBIR that developed and pilot tested a theoretically-grounded, mobile- optimized, interactive pain self-management intervention for Veterans with chronic musculoskeletal pain. Health eRide: Your Journey to Managing Pain 1) was tailored specifically to Veterans' readiness and preferred strategies for pain self-management; 2) leveraged SMS messaging, social networking, and gaming principles to increase engagement and retention; and 3) helped to address the co-occurrence of PTSD and TBI by including health behavior change messages for sleep hygiene and stress management. At 30-day follow-up, participants (n=44) reported significant reductions in pain and pain impact, as well as increased readiness to employ self-management strategies. Over 68% of participants reported favorable global impression of change. Phase II will involve 1) completing the development of Health eRide by transforming it into an app and enhancing its functionality for mobile browsers, enhancing the social networking and gaming features, and adding e-coaching capabilities; and 2) conducting a year- long randomized trial in which 540 Veterans with chronic pain recruited from both VA facilities and the community are randomly assigned to Health eRide or an online educational cognitive- behavioral therapy intervention. Differences in pain intensity and interference will be examined at 6 months (immediately post-intervention) and 12-months. A number of secondary analyses will be conducted to examine the impact Health eRide has on other outcomes (e.g., PTSD symptoms). A successful trial will set the stage for widespread dissemination of an efficacious, easily accessible tailored pain self-management intervention to address an urgent need among our nation's Veterans as well as an adaptation for general adult populations."
"9397918","Anticipated Impacts on Veteran's Healthcare: The Medicare Independence-at-Home (IAH) demonstration which provides frail elderly patients with provider-managed integrated care and supportive services at home has shown reduced rates of hospitalizations, 30-day rehospitalizations, emergency department care, and an average $3,070 annual costs savings per patient. This study will examine if VA's Home Based Primary Care (HBPC) program, the inceptor of IAH, produces similar outcomes among Veterans who meet IAH qualifying criteria (IAH-Q). High HBPC program costs have limited the availability of HBPC and it is currently serving less than 25% of Veterans who meet IAH-Q. This project will provide the Offices of Geriatrics and Extended Care (GEC) Policy (10P4G) and Operations (10NC4) with information needed to make informed decisions about effective expansion of the HBPC program, and tools to target Veterans who will benefit from it most. Project Background: The IAH demo is associated with better outcomes and reduced healthcare costs compared to routine care. While VA has operated the HBPC program since the 1970s, it only serves a fraction of the Veterans who meet the Medicare IAH-Q. VA has expanded HBPC from operating in less than half its facilities in 2000 to almost all facilities today. However, the program's reach is still constrained because of the relatively large up-front costs and the lack of readily applicable admission criteria to identify those who would benefit from the program. Further, since over half of the current HBPC enrollees do not meet the IAH-Q, VA needs information on which Veterans should be considered for HBPC so that the program can be available to those Veterans who will likely achieve the most clinical and economic benefit. Project Objectives: One: Does VA's HBPC, when targeted to IAH-Q Veterans, achieve the same clinical outcomes and cost savings as Medicare's IAH-Q beneficiaries receiving Medicare HBPC? Two: Extend the evaluation methods to exploit VA data that was not available to the Medicare evaluation, and include alternative estimation methods to test the robustness of the findings. Three: VA currently provides HBPC to Veterans who do not meet IAH-Q criteria. What is the effectiveness of HBPC in these other groups? Are there non-IAH-Q groups of Veterans for whom HBPC would be cost- effective? Further, what is the variability in the effectiveness of HBPC among IAH-Q Veterans? Four: Develop targeting criteria equivalent to IAH-Q that use only VA data, without relying on data from CMS, to identify Veterans for HBPC enrollment, including refinement of IAH-Q criteria with VA risk measures such as JEN Frailty Index and CAN scores. Five: The CMS demonstration project considered only Medicare expenditures. How does HBPC care affect utilization and costs across Medicare, Medicaid and VA? Project Methods: This project will use Medicare, Medicaid and VA data to capture all relevant utilization and diagnoses. We will identify all Veterans who were potentially eligible for HBPC in 2011. The intervention cohort will be all Veterans who received HBPC in 2012. The control group will be determined from those potentially eligible Veterans who did not use HBPC in 2012 using a direct demographic match, with a propensity score matching based on diagnoses, health services utilization, treatments and prescriptions and MDS or OASIS frailty assessments. We will follow both groups through 2015, comparing functional status, utilization of services, and costs."
"9467034","Project Summary/Abstract Cancer cells have significantly altered glycosylation patterns compared to normal cells, but the functional significance with regard to cancer progression is not well understood. This gap in knowledge is largely attributable to the difficulties associated with studying cell-surface glycans and their associated structures. The need for new techniques to study glycoproteins is crucial to understand how aberrant glycosylation contributes to the onset, progression, and metastasis of cancer. Thus, the goal of this project is to develop enzymatic methods that allow for the study of cell-surface glycoproteins. E. coli secretes a mellaloprotease, secreted protease of C1-esterase inhibitor (StcE) that proteolytically cleaves mucin proteins on the surface of gut epithelial cells. Initial characterization of this enzyme confirmed previous reports of its ability to cleave mucin-type glycoproteins and its dependency on glycosylation. Further, StcE?s cleavage motif is dependent on both peptide sequence and the presence of glycosylation. As its motif is found within the vast majority of mucin-like glycoproteins, StcE and other bacterial mucinases can be used to open new avenues of basic research while also enabling therapeutic applications. This information will be used to interrogate aberrant glycosylation in two ways. First, natural killer cells express inhibitory receptors, sialic acid-binding immunoglobulin-like lectins (Siglecs), that downregulate NK cytotoxicity upon binding their sialic acid containing ligands. However, despite knowledge of glycan specificity, high-affinity glycoprotein ligands have remained elusive. StcE cleaves Siglec-7 glycoprotein ligands on the surface of tumor cells, as demonstrated by preliminary experiments. Thus, cell surface proteins will be treated with StcE. Cleaved peptides will be enriched with Siglec-7 conjugated beads and analyzed by mass spectrometry. Confirmed glycoprotein ligands will be analyzed for their ability to modulate NK activity. Secondly, mucin proteins are prevalent glycoproteins on the cell surface and are characterized by dense O- glycosylation that is abnormally truncated in cancer. However, it is not understood how tumors modulate structures and site-specificity of O-glycosylation. Using bacterial mucinases like StcE, these issues can be overcome. Four purported bacterial mucinases will be expressed and characterized. MUC1 and MUC16 will be isolated from overexpressing cell lines, bacterial mucinases will be used to digest the proteins in a site- and glycan-specific manner, and peptides will be analyzed with mass spectrometry. Additionally, the role of mucin degradation on immune function will be investigated. Ultimately, should the goals of this proposal be attained, the methods developed will prove invaluable to the field of glycobiology. Additionally, the biological information gathered will shed light on how glycosylation contributes to tumor progression, which will help in cancer immunotherapy design."
"9394968","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Recapitulation of folliculogenesis in vitro is of interest for both preserving human fertility and assessing the influence of chemical contaminants on ovarian health. Although live offspring can be produced from oocytes recovered from murine follicles grown in vitro, the larger size and protracted duration of folliculogenesis of large mammals likely necessitates more complex culture requirements. The domestic cat will be used as a study model because this species shares a number of anatomical and reproductive characteristics including follicle size and oocyte nuclear configuration with the human. The proposed project will take advantage of ?organ-on-chip? microfluidic technology combined with somatic cell co-culture and my experience with 3-dimensional hydrogels to recapitulate, as possible, in vivo conditions in an ?ovary-on-a-chip?. Specifically, I propose to quantify the rigidity of the domestic cat ovary via micropipette aspiration and atomic force microscopy and identify biomimetic densities of alginate hydrogel that provide optimal structural support to primordial follicles. I will determine the influence of rigidity and medium flow rate on in vitro folliculogenesis, and identify via tandem mass spectrometry and RNA sequencing technologies, proteins and genes involved in follicle activation in culture. Comparison of the dynamic system with traditional, static culture will allow me to improve understanding of the contributions of structural rigidity (hydrogel density), medium flow (microfluidic chip), and the paracrine environment (produced via co-culture) on follicle survival and activation in vitro (Aim 1). I then propose to evaluate the epigenetic impacts (methylation of histones, key imprinted genes) of long-term culture in this system compared with traditional culture, as well as determine the utility of the ?ovary-on-a-chip? in ovarian toxicology studies, using the active form of the chemotherapeutic cyclophosphamide in proof-of-concept studies (Aim 2).

Specifically, precise structural models of these interactions can provide mechanistic details with atomic resolution to assist in the efficient development of novel compounds against pathogens of significant health relevance. The influenza virus is a prime example of one such pathogen. Novel strains of the influenza virus develop annually via infection and replication in a number of animal hosts, including humans. The relative ability of these strains to cause disease, or virulence, is determined by a number of interactions between viral and cellular proteins. Although influenza non-structural protein 1 (NS1) is known to play a critical role in virulence, there is a fundamental gap in our knowledge of the genetic and structural determinants that facilitate the multiple strain-dependent functions attributed to NS1 in the host cell. It is therefore our long-term goal to understand the molecular mechanisms that underlie strain-dependent function of NS1. The objective of this application is to structurally characterize interactions with two cellular proteins (CPSF30 and RIG-I) that are important for the activation of the innate immune response. Our central hypothesis is that structural and dynamic features unique to certain NS1 variants account for the diverse array of functions attributed to NS1. The rationale that underlies the proposed research is that elucidating structure- function relationships between NS1 and its cellular interaction partners will aid in the development of antiviral drugs that target these critical interactions known to modulate virulence. Our central hypothesis will be tested by pursuing three specific aims: 1) structurally and functionally characterize the multiple interactions between NS1 and RIG-I, 2) determine the role of microsecond-millisecond (µs-ms) motions in proper function of the NS1 effector domain (NS1ED), and 3) determine the mechanism of action by which JJ3297 suppresses influenza replication. In Aim 1, NMR spectroscopy and mutant recombinant influenza viruses will be used to structurally and functionally characterize the multiple interactions between NS1 and RIG-I. In Aim 2, relaxation dispersion experiments will be used to determine the role that protein dynamics play in facilitating the interaction between the NS1ED and CPSF30 and intracellular localization of NS1. In Aim 3, NMR spectroscopy will be used to determine the mechanism of action by which JJ3297 suppresses influenza replication. Our innovative approach will be the first investigation into how protein dynamics and strain specific structural variations facilitate proper function of NS1 in the context of viral replication and pathogenicity. This will also be the first systematic study to determine functional variations in NS1 between multiple strains of influenza. The proposed research is significant because it will define the molecular mechanisms underlying NS1 functions shown to modulate influenza virulence. By defining these molecular mechanisms, this proposal will inform efforts in developing influenza antiviral drugs targeting NS1, thereby supporting the overall mission of the NIH."
"9535668","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite advances in the understanding of alterations in brain and behavior in adult affective psychopathology, and the more recent conceptualization of these illnesses as neurodevelopmental in origin, there is a dearth of early developmental data to inform this trajectory. The current proposal aims to fill this gap using data from a unique 13 year prospective longitudinal study, which started in the preschool period and contains three waves of functional and structural scan data: the Preschool Depression Study [PDS]. The proposed extension of this PDS study will focus on three constructs/RDoC domains encompassing specific aspects of emotion reactivity and regulation thought to be central to the development of affective psychopathology: 1) Negative Emotion Reactivity (NER), 2) Reward Reactivity (RR), and 3) Cognitive Emotion Re-appraisal (CER). Data from this sample has already shown that children who were depressed as preschoolers show similar alterations in brain structure and function relevant to the three constructs of interest as established in depressed adults. Brain markers of later recurrence, over and above behavioral symptoms have also been identified. Importantly, both hormonal and psychosocial factors influenced behavior and brain structure/function in the data to date. Follow-up of this unique sample with two additional waves of imaging and comprehensive assessment of these constructs, including measures of hormones, as they pass through adolescence represents an unprecedented, but time limited, opportunity to investigate early developmental antecedents and predictors of adolescent affective psychopathology. The proposed study will directly target the constructs of interest using parent and child report, direct behavioral assessments, and reward and emotion reappraisal tasks during fMRI scanning, as well as structural imaging and resting state functional connectivity, using tools developed in the Human Connectome Project. Using latent growth curve modeling approaches, we will test the hypotheses that specific patterns of individual differences in trajectories of the neural circuitry supporting NER (e.g., insula, hippocampus, amygdala), CER (e.g., dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and dorsal anterior cingulate and RR (e.g., striatum, insula) measured during preschool, school age and/or early adolescence predict: (1a) measures of the same constructs in mid to late adolescence; and (1b) risk for reoccurrence or new onset of affective psychopathology in adolescence, over key phenomenological and psychosocial variables assessed from preschool to school age. We will also test the hypothesis that pubertal timing and hormonal factors interact with both adaptive and impaired forms of NER, RR and CER to contribute to the emergence of sex differences in affective psychopathology during the high-risk phase of adolescence. This work will allow an investigation of the role of early childhood emotion and brain function in the course and trajectory of adolescent affective psychopathology, identification of potential markers of risk and pathways for early intervention, as well as potential mechanisms driving sex differences that emerge at this period."
"9394709","Project Summary/Abstract Mouse Embryonic Stem (ES) cells are derived from the Inner Cell Mass (ICM) just prior to implantation into the uterus. In the embryo, they are pluripotent, i.e. they give rise to all cell types of the adult organism. When maintained in specific culture conditions, ES cells propagate essentially indefinitely as pluripotent cells in vitro, a property called self-renewal. As a result, ES cells are a useful system for understanding the mechanisms that promote pluripotency versus lineage commitment in the embryo and have become essential to studies of embryonic development and regeneration. Many studies have examined the transcriptional, epigenetic, and signaling programs that contribute to ES cell self-renewal. Growing evidence suggests that the ubiquitin- proteasome system (UPS) also reinforces ES cell identity. The UPS consists of a network of ubiquitin ligases, enzymes that add ubiquitin to substrates; deubiquitinases (DUBs), which oppose the actions of ubiquitin ligases; and the proteasome, which degrades ubiquitinated proteins. The contributions of DUBs to pluripotency are still poorly understood, despite several examples of DUBs promoting self-renewal. In preliminary studies, we have found that the DUB Usp9x promotes the open chromatin state and self-renewal capacity of ES cells. We propose to study this protein in mouse ES cells and will test the hypothesis that Usp9x is an important regulator of ES cell identity, promoting self-renewal by deubiquitinating and stabilizing key components of self- renewal pathways. Specifically, we aim to dissect the role(s) of Usp9x in mouse ES cells by (1) analyzing the consequences of Usp9x genetic deletion and mutation on ES cell self renewal and lineage induction (2) and by identifying key substrates and interacting partners. This work aims to shed light on the interplay between the ubiquitin-proteasome system and self-renewal programs. It is highly relevant to studies of molecular mechanisms underlying intellectual and developmental disability and has the potential to offer insight into how USP9X deregulation promotes human developmental disorders, neurological syndromes, and cancer."
"9189570","Background: Contextualizing care is the process of adapting care plans to patients' individual needs and circumstances. For instance, a plan to address poorly controlled diabetes is contextualized when it addresses possible barriers to self-care, such as visual problems that create physical barriers to medication self-administration, or competing responsibilities that interfere with scheduled appointments. Conversely, a failure to attend to contextual factors, such as increasing the dosage of insulin rather than addressing the obstacles to adherence when present, is termed a ?contextual error? because it is an inappropriate plan of care that can lead to clinical deterioration and greater health care cost. Identifying contextual errors requires listening to an audio recording of the encounter and coding the audio for specific indicators of context and clinicians' attention to them. Evidence indicates that inattention to patient context is common, adversely impacts health care outcomes, increases costs through overuse and misuse of services, and creates obstacles to patient adherence to care plans. An extensive program of research on contextual errors and how to prevent them has culminated in a VISN 12 funded quality improvement initiative that is based on audit and feedback, in which audio recorded data is collected by Veterans on provider attention to care planning, analyzed and organized using Content Coding for Contextualization of Care (?4C?) system and fed back to PACTs and clinicians to facilitate continuous quality improvement.  Objectives: To identify the most efficient, effective, and acceptable data driven strategy for improving contextualization of care in VHA through an implementation and efficacy study of the expansion of an audit & feedback for contextualizing care intervention package (?package?) in VISN 12. The study will assess the efficacy of the intervention package at two levels of intensity, the effectiveness of implementation strategies, and the potential of the intervention to pay for itself by reducing unnecessary care.  Design: We propose an Effectiveness-Implementation type 2 hybrid design because we have two co-primary aims: optimizing implementation and evaluating the intervention's effectiveness. In addition, we seek to document the costs and cost savings of the intervention package to ascertain its budget impact. The project will utilize the RE-AIM implementation-evaluation framework to assess the reach, effectiveness, adoption, implementation and maintenance of the intervention. The project will add four additional sites to the two currently engaged in the package, two in VISN 12 and two outside. The rollout of the package will follow a randomized stepped wedge design comparing baseline at the 4 new sites (no intervention) to both a standard and enhanced feedback intervention, with the latter more intensive but more costly.  Analysis: Assessment of efficacy will measure impact on contextualization of care rates, health care outcomes, and costs, the latter through a budget impact analysis. Assessment of implementation will employ survey and focus group methods to identify and address obstacles to implementation, optimizing the extent to which it is perceived as safe, not burdensome, and valuable by clinicians and patients.  Impact: This project takes a decade of research on contextual error and a recent pilot project to prevent them, and applies that work to the refinement and assessment of a strategy for reducing these errors with an approach that may be scalable and transformative for the Veterans' care. By focusing on ?novel strategies to change provider behavior within the context of a learning health care system,? it is a response to the Provider Behavior RFA. It is also aligned with the VHA's new Blueprint for Excellence which seeks, through ?performance improvement?to improve not only the care, but the health and well- being of individuals.?"
"9553003","Abstract The overall vision is to create a detailed understanding of mechanisms that regulate the blood clotting system, with a goal of elucidating the aspects of the clotting machinery that function differentially in hemostasis versus thrombosis. The conceptual framework is that human thrombotic diseases result from an otherwise protective mechanism (immunothrombosis) gone awry. In this view, hemostasis following vascular injury is driven by the prompt exposure of blood to preexisting, natural procoagulants such as tissue factor and collagen that are ubiquitous throughout the body and that induce rapid formation of hemostatic plugs. On the other hand, immunothrombosis is likely triggered and/or greatly enhanced by the elaboration of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) and pathogen-associate molecular patterns (PAMPs). An important concept is that many of these PAMPs and DAMPs that drive immunothrombosis are potential therapeutic targets that should have little or no involvement in normal hemostasis. In order to achieve this vision, we need to have a much better mechanistic understanding of what regulates blood clotting reactions, and in particular we need to identify and understand the DAMPs that drive thrombosis and coagulopathies. The proposed work will focus on three general areas within this general conceptual framework: elucidating mechanisms by which procoagulant anionic polymers such as polyphosphate (polyP) and nucleic acids trigger regulate blood clotting and inflammation; identifying key structural details that control the function of the tissue factor/factor VIIa complex; and achieving a detailed understanding of how phospholipid bilayers regulate blood clotting reactions. These studies will build on our prior success in this area and will advance the field."
"9589778","The present MERIT Award extension will maintain its focus on the remarkable structural adaptability of  apolipoproteins. This class of plasma protein performs essential functions, including receptor ligands,  modulators of lipid metabolic enzymes and stabilization of plasma lipoproteins. Methods to introduce novel  functional properties into reconstituted HDL (rHDL) will be exploited by altering rHDL lipids, introducing  hydrophobic bioactive agents and tethering extraneous proteins. The therapeutic utility of these stable, self-  assembled, water-soluble nanoscale size particles will be investigated. As a corollary to their physiological  role in lipid transport and cholesterol efflux, the use of designer rHDL for replacement therapy applications  and bioactive agent delivery is a rapidly advancing research front Our efforts are designed to validate  concepts related to protein binding to rHDL and their delivery to cells. In aim 1, it is hypothesized that the  Gaucher's disease phenotype in a macrophage cell model will be corrected by incubation with a  phosphatidylserine-enriched, glucocerebrosidase-tethered rHDL. Enzyme uptake will be evaluated by flow  cytometry / confocal fluorescence microscopy. Glucocerebrosidase activity in cell lysates, as well as  changes in the cellular glucocerebroside content, will be measured. In Aim 2, we hypothesize that cellular  delivery of Niemann-Pick C2 (NPC2) protein-tethered rHDL via apoE dependent uptake by members of the  low-density lipoprotein receptor family will result in NPC2 delivery to lysosomes, rescuing the Niemann-Pick  disease phenotype in GM18455 fibroblasts. NPC2-tethered apoE-containing rHDL will be incubated with  cultured GM18455 fibroblasts and the ability of apoE to promote binding, uptake and lysosomal delivery of  NPC2 will be determined, along with effects on lysosomal cholesterol content / organelle morphology. In Aim  3, agonist-induced activation of macrophage cholesterol efflux will be investigated. We hypothesize that one  or more liver X receptor / retinoid X receptor (LXR / RXR) agonist can be delivered to macrophages in  complex with rHDL. It is further hypothesized that nuclear hormone receptor activation will induce apoE /  ABCA1 expression, resulting in increased cholesterol efflux capacity. The ability to generate water soluble,  targeted rHDL capable of receptor-mediated protein / bioactive agent delivery to cells represents a novel  strategy for disease treatment. The intrinsic versatility of the lipid and protein components of rHDL allows for  their assembly with additional components, yielding stable complexes that can be used as delivery vehicles"
"9441473","ABSTRACT  Viridans group streptococci (VGS), especially Streptococcus mitis, are pivotal pathogens in a variety of invasive endovascular infections,including: i) ?breakthrough bacteremias? and ?toxic shock? in neutropenic cancer patients; and ii) infective endocarditis (IE). Given world-wide trends in penicillin-resistance and other ?-lactam MIC ?creeps? amongst S. mitis strains, the proportion of serious infections caused by relatively or fully ?-lactam-resistant-(R) strains is disturbing. Moreover, clinical outcomes in such cases utilizing alternate regimens (e.g., vancomycin) have been disappointing, presumably related to the high prevalence of vancomycin ?tolerance? in such strains. This has prompted use of newer bactericidal agents, like daptomycin (DAP) for severe S. mitis syndromes in strains with ?-lactam-resistance. Alarmingly, recent recognition of rapid, durable and high-level DAP-R induced by DAP therapy has significantly reduced enthusiasm for such approaches. In addition, DAP MICs in the S. mitis group are 2-10-fold higher than all other VGS groups. The number of reported clinical cases of invasive S. mitis infections in which DAP-R has emerged is limited, due to the relatively infrequent use of DAP in such infections to-date. However, progressive rise in S. mitis ?-lactam-R plus the inconsistent outcomes of VANC therapy in such syndromes virtually assures increased DAP use, leading to DAP-R S. mitis infections. Moreover, medical centers with high DAP usage have recently confirmed substantial MIC ?creeps? amongst enterococci. Understanding mechanism(s) of emergence of DAP-R in S. mitis, plus strategies to circumvent its evolution are, thus, of great clinical significance.  Our Preliminary Data showed that DAP-R outcomes in S. mitis are likely to be multifactorial on both phenotypic and genotypic levels. Most interestingly, we have now shown compelling evidence of two forms of ?DAP hyperaccumulation? in which individual cells in a given streptococcal chain can hyper-capture DAP and either die (?altruistic suicide?) or resist DAP killing, in order to protect the remainder of the cell population from DAP exposures and lethality. This is an apparently unique mechanism of DAP-R amongst gram-positive pathogens.  In this proposal, we will use strategic fluorescence microscopy, flow cytometry with multidimensional physiologic interrogations, and single cell sorting plus genotyping to divulge mechanisms by which DAP-R S. mitis can resist DAP exposures. Finally, we will use two well-characterized models of endovascular infections, ex vivo (chamber model) and in vivo (experimental rabbit IE), to define DAP regimens to both circumvent emergence of DAP-R and enhance clearance of S. mitis. In summary, these studies will divulge clinical strategies to forestall emergence of DAP-R in S. mitis and perhaps other Gram-positive pathogens."
"9385283","This project focuses on the interplay of cytomegalovirus (CMV)-encoded immunomodulators and host defense pathways that control the initial stages of viral infection within the natural host. These cell-autonomous pathways dictate parameters of acute infection, such as tissue tropism and dissemination. They also control establishment of a reservior for life-long persistence and latency and constantly defend against host immune clearance mechanisms. Importantly, we have shown that herpesviruses such as human (H) or murine (M) CMV, as well as herpes simplex virus (HSV)1 and HSV2, all employ evolutionarily related cell death suppressors that block programmed cell death. In MCMV, suppressors prolong infection and enhance spread, providing a tractable model to elaborate the contribution of specific cellular compartments to the ancient virus- host arms race that plays out during natural infection. The host pathways we study are conserved in humans as well as mice, providing key insights that cannot be obtained using HCMV or primate CMV models. Macrophages are important partners for all CMVs, starting from the initial encounter with virus inoculum, proceeding with the orchestration of viral dissemination, resulting in the deposition in sites of persistence and latency, and critical for the reappearence of virus sporadically or as a result of immunosuppression. All of the insights into murine CMV pathogenesis and latency from the studies we propose will point relevant directions for studies in human CMV. Our unique approach involves the use of viruses that lack specific cell death suppressors combined with mice that are deficient in the cognate host defense pathways that these suppressors target. We propose to move to a new phase of study and dissect the contribution of apoptosis, necroptosis and other programmed cell death pathways within specific tissue compartments. These studies are therefore relevant to an expanding range of human pathogens, most immediately HSV and other human herpesviruses. The specific host defense value of necroptosis has recently emerged along with the fascinating observation that this and other cell death pathways are interlaced and interdependent. Necroptosis is capable of completely preventing infection of a naïve host because all exposed cells die within hours of exposure. In the next period, we will specifically investigate the contribution of serine protease death pathways that were first brought to light in our studies of HCMV in macrophages. Importantly, the project will determine the contribution of cell death in monocytes, macrophages, endothelial cells and epithelial cells during natural infection in mice. As a result, the contribution of specific programmed cell death pathways to all relevant stages of viral pathogenesis will emerge."
"9553015","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There is significant interest in the development of 'T cell adjuvants', biocompounds capable of enhancing T cell immune responses against tumors or chronic infections. In order to target diseased tissue for elimination, T cells must recognize antigens via the T cell antigen receptor (TCR), and induce a conformational change in the TCR-associated CD3 complex (v). However, the mechanism(s) by which this occurs, and the precise contribution this makes to T cell immunity, are not completely understood. In this project, we propose to elucidate the protein sequences controlling CD3?c in experiments designed to inform new conceptual models regarding the structural aspects of T cell activation. We will focus on the TCR/CD3 subunits, domains, and amino acid sequences involved in CD3?c. Relevant sequences that are discovered in this manner will be mutated and expressed to ascertain their functional contribution to T cell development and activation. We will also determine the contribution that exogenous provision of CD3?c imparts to T cell function, via the use of a new reagent we have generated. This reagent can induce CD3?c without inducing other T cell signaling, and therefore it is inert to non-antigen-engaged T cells. However, the reagent appears to enhance T cell activation by weak antigens, and thus may represent a novel class of 'T cell adjuvant'. We will examine the ability of this reagent to lower the T cell activation signaling threshold, and to enhance T cell-mediated tumor rejection in mice. The information obtained from these studies will advance our comprehension of antigen recognition by T cells, and point toward CD3?c as molecular target with therapeutic potential."
"9382870","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Developmental language disorders are highly prevalent in the general population. One of the earliest warning signs of many developmental disorders is delayed language acquisition, which is also associated with higher risk for subsequent reading and language disorders. However, little is known about how neural networks underlying language learning develop in early infancy and what neural and genetic mechanisms cause certain individuals to diverge onto an atypical developmental trajectory that leads to developmental language impairments. While there is a small but growing body of research using passive fMRI to examine the neural basis of language in infants (during natural sleep), no studies to date have used a longitudinal design or related early brain-based measures to subsequent behavioral outcomes. Understanding how early brain activity and connectivity relate to later language development may ultimately inform early diagnosis and interventions that will be more effective for treating developmental disorders that affect language. It is therefore essential to characterize the development of the neural networks subserving language acquisition in typically developing infants to serve as a basis for understanding how this system may go awry in developmental disorders such as specific language impairment, dyslexia, and autism spectrum disorders.  Here we propose to use a longitudinal multimodal approach integrating several neuroimaging measures with genetic data to investigate developmental changes in language-relevant networks in the infant brain. By using passive fMRI during natural sleep, we will study infants at two time points: 1.5 and 9 months of age. Prior studies have shown that newborns already demonstrate a preference for their native language and that by 6 months of age, infants can implicitly identify word boundaries in continuous speech by relying on statistical and prosodic cues in the input. Using stimuli analogous to those employed in these milestone behavioral studies, passive fMRI will be conducted to probe the neural signatures of these early linguistic achievements in the infant brain. Resting-state fMRI will also be performed to characterize developmental changes in functional connectivity within language-relevant brain networks. Using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), deterministic and probabilistic tractography will be conducted to examine the development of specific structural (i.e., white matter) tracts that connect language areas in the developing brain. In addition, we will examine how common genetic risk variants in CNTNAP2 that have been associated with language impairments in neurodevelopmental disorders may affect both activity and connectivity within language-relevant networks. Finally, we will relate th early measures of brain activity and connectivity to behavioral indices of language development assessed longitudinally (from 6 to 24 months of age).  Taken together, the studies outlined in this proposal aim to investigate the functional and structural networks underlying language acquisition in the infant brain, and to further examine how these networks are affected by CNTNAP2, a gene that plays a significant role in the development of fronto-striatal networks subserving language learning. The findings from the proposed research will provide insight into the neural mechanisms underlying language learning in typical development and ultimately inform the early detection of altered developmental trajectories, which could lead to more effective interventions due to increased neuroplasticity early in development."
"9599642","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): It is estimated that 0.5%-1.0% of the U.S. population has epilepsy, and that 20% of patients with epilepsy have medically refractory seizures. Patients with unilateral temporal lobe seizure onsets have an excellent chance of becoming seizure-free following temporal lobectomy. Based on the successful completion of a Pilot Clinical Trial showing that seizure-free rates were in excess of 80% and with acceptable toxicity, there is equipoise for treating well-selected patients with either radiosurgery or temporal resection. The purpose of this study is to compare the effectiveness of radiosurgery with temporal lobectomy in the treatment of patients with pharmaco-resistant temporal lobe epilepsy including freedom from seizures, seizure reduction, neuropsychological outcomes, quality of life and cost-effectiveness. Aim 1: To compare the seizure-free outcomes and morbidity of Gamma Knife radiosurgery (GKS) for patients with pharmaco-resistant temporal lobe epilepsy with those of open temporal lobectomy. Our primary hypothesis is that radiosurgery and lobectomy will have equivalent seizure-free rates at 25-36 months following therapy (one-year of seizure freedom beginning 2 years after treatment). The two arms will be considered equivalent if a one-sided 95% confidence interval precludes a decrease in seizure-free rate of 15%. Our secondary hypothesis is that radiosurgery will result in significant reductions in seizures compared to baseline and that by 2 years following treatment the percentage reduction in seizures will be identical for these two treatments. Aim 2: To compare the neuropsychological outcomes in patients undergoing radiosurgery and temporal lobe surgery, in particular with respect to verbal memory function for language-dominant hemisphere treated patients. Our hypothesis is that patients treated for speech-dominant temporal lobe seizures with temporal lobectomy will show significant reductions in verbal memory and those patients treated with radiosurgery will not have significant reduction in measures of verbal memory. Aim 3: To determine what changes occur in the quality of life of patients with temporal lobe epilepsy following radiosurgical treatment as compared with open surgery. Our primary hypothesis is that there will be improvements (comparing baseline with 3 years post- treatment) in quality of life measures in both groups. Our secondary hypothesis is that both open surgery and radiosurgery subjects will undergo transient reductions in quality of life measures caused by treatment effects during the first year following treatment, but that quality of life will improve for subjects who become seizure-free, independent of treatment group. Aim 4: To compare the cost-effectiveness of radiosurgery compared with open surgery. We hypothesize that radiosurgery will be cost-effective compared to temporal lobectomy over the lifetime of the patient. The purpose of this study is to compare two methods of treatment of surgically-amenable epilepsy: standard anterior temporal lobectomy versus noninvasive Gamma Knife radiosurgery. Beyond the main outcome of the number of patients rendered seizure-free, we will compare preservation of language functions, quality of life measures, and the cost of treatment."
"9398582","Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are neurodevelopmental abnormalities characterized by impairments in two core domains: social interaction/communication and repetitive, stereotyped behaviors. Accumulating evidence suggests that mutations in genes essential for synaptic function, such as the synaptic adhesion molecules neurexin and neuroligin, are associated with ASD. While human genetic studies have revealed a growing number of candidate genes implicated in ASD it has been difficult to investigate autism pathophysiology due to the polygenic nature of the disease. One potential approach is to identify specific neural circuits that mediate ASD-associated behaviors. Recently, our lab has identified a nucleus accumbens circuit defect that drives ASD-related motor behaviors, by employing the accelerating rotating rod (rotarod) paradigm as a measurement of the formation of repetitive motor routines. We demonstrated that learning in this task was correlated with decreased variability of multiple behavioral measures, including vertical location of step placement, the length of each step and the temporal interval between steps. Furthermore, Neuroligin-3 knockout (KO) mice had an enhancement in rotarod learning that was driven by a more rapid and lasting ?stereotyping? of all three behavioral measures. At the physiological level, we found that decreased synaptic inhibition onto nucleus accumbens D1R+ MSNs in Neuroligin-3 KOs could in part drive formation of stereotyped behavior in the rotarod paradigm. As the enhanced rotarod learning phenotype has recently been observed across multiple genetic mouse models for ASD, I will employ this task as a behavioral ?endophenotype? in attempts to uncover common neural circuit abnormalities. I hypothesize that impaired synaptic transmission in the nucleus accumbens is a recurring neural circuit defect that mediates enhanced stereotyped motor output. In this proposal, I will be examining alterations of nucleus accumbens synaptic function and behavioral output in an ASD-associated mouse model harboring mutations in Neurexin-1?, a synaptic adhesion protein involved in synapse organization and function. In Aim 1, changes in nucleus accumbens synaptic activity that may contribute to ASD-related motor abnormalities will be probed in striatal acute slice preparations via whole-cell electrophysiological recordings. In Aim 2, I will employ circuit?specific genetic loss-of-function, together with in vivo chemogenetic manipulations to put our electrophysiological findings into a behaviorally relevant neural circuit context. Together, these aims will provide a robust training program while exploring novel neural circuit changes that may drive ASD-relevant behaviors."
"9467296","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Cancers are serious and highly prevalent diseases, with an estimated 14 million new cases and 8.2 million deaths worldwide in 2012. Among the wide variety of chemotherapeutic agents, taxane drugs like paclitaxel (Taxol®) have emerged as standards of care for the treatment of certain cancers. Unfortunately, the utility of these drugs is limited by their pronounced lipophilicity and the recent emergence of resistant cancers, creating an urgent need for novel taxane chemotherapeutics. This proposal describes a plan to synthesize the taxane molecule taxagifine, as well as structurally related natural and unnatural taxanes, in an effort to provide new compounds for biological study. Taxagifine exhibits promising microtubule-stabilizing and cytotoxic properties and demonstrates potential activity against resistant cancers, but differs structurally from paclitaxel at several positions, including an unusual C17?C12 oxo-bridge functionality which will likely impart increased aqueous solubility relative to paclitaxel. Further studies of taxagifine have been frustrated by a lack of material: isolation from nature is extremely inefficient, and the C17?C12 oxo-bridge poses a significant challenge to any semi-synthetic routes. This proposal describes the first total synthetic approach to taxagifine and related compounds, with the hypothesis that the expansion of Sarpong's C?C activation/arylation reaction of carvone-derived cyclobutanols will enable a concise, convergent, and scalable synthesis of taxagifine. The Specific Aims of the proposal are: 1) Expansion of the C?C activation/arylation methodology recently developed by Sarpong and co-workers to allow for the use of synthetically versatile vinyl electrophiles, 2) Apply the C?C activation/vinylation reaction developed in Aim I to the construction of the oxo-bridged A ring and subsequently the total synthesis of taxagifine, and 3) Use the concise route to taxagifine developed in Aim II to make other natural taxanes containing the C17?C12 oxo-bridge, as well as unnatural taxagifine derivatives for structure-activity- relationship (SAR) studies. Our syntheses of unnatural analogs will focus on exploiting the synthetic route to install functionalization at underexplored positions on the taxagifine framework. The synthesis of paclitaxel- taxagifine hybrids will also be investigated to probe the taxagifine binding conformation. The development of a C?C activation/vinylation reaction will allow for the construction of a diverse array of terpenoid scaffolds, with potential use in medicinal chemistry and natural products total synthesis. Use of this reaction to synthesize taxagifine as well as natural and unnatural analogs will enable SAR and mechanism of action studies, furthering our understanding of microtubule-interactions and helping to identify potential second generation taxane therapeutic agents."
"9591593","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): More than one-third of U.S. population is obese. The prevalence of obesity-related comorbidities such as type-2 diabetes and heart diseases emphasizes the need for concerted efforts to prevent and treat obesity. A decrease in ?5% of the body weight significantly reduces cardiovascular risk in humans which clearly demonstrates the urgency of weight management. Lifestyle intervention is primary albeit not sufficient in long term weight management. Thus, we need anti-obesity drugs. Due to partial effects of the current anti-obesity drugs that inhibit food intake or absorption, recent focus has shifted towards enhancing energy expenditure in metabolic tissues. Adipose tissue is a major regulator of energy metabolism. Therefore, adipose tissue function in normal and obese conditions are being extensively studied. Because of the complexity of the adipose tissue, a complete understanding of the mechanism and regulation of its metabolism is still lacking. Discovery of all the major components of adipose tissue metabolism will certainly help to design therapeutic strategies. In this proposal, we introduce IP6K1 as one such component with therapeutic potential. Our laboratory is interested in understanding the mechanism and regulation of adipose tissue metabolism in normal and obese conditions using mouse models. Utilizing the inositol hexakisphosphate kinase 1 (IP6K1) knockout (K1-KO) mice, we previously discovered that these mice are resistant to weight gain and insulin resistance, despite their unaltered food intake. The objective of the current proposal is to determine the mechanisms by which IP6K1 promotes lipid accumulation in the adipose tissue using whole body and adipose tissue specific IP6K1 mouse models. The central hypothesis is that IP6K1 is a major regulator of energy metabolism in the adipose tissue. To test this hypothesis, role of IP6K1 in; 1) adipose tissue browning and thermogenesis; 2) lipolysis and; 3) adipogenesis will be determined and underlying mechanisms by which IP6K1 regulates these processes will be identified. The proposed research is conceptually innovative, because it represents a new and substantive departure from the status quo, namely determining the mechanisms by which IP6K1 regulates adipose mass. The contribution is significant because it is the first step in a continuum of research that is expected to lead to development of novel pharmacologic strategies in obesity. Therefore, the proposed project is expected to have significant impacts on improving quality of life."

Understanding inter-individual response variation requires elucidation of the underlying pathways and the influence of genotypes. LCPUFA biosynthesis is limited by desaturase activity encoded by the fatty acid desaturase gene cluster (FADS1-3, 11q12-13.1). FADS intronic and intergenic SNPs are disproportionately identified as significant in genetic studies (e.g. GWAS). In recent years we showed that all the FADS genes have conserved, highly expressed, and phylogenetically conserved alternative transcripts (AT). A newly described FADS1 AT has desaturase function and new siRNA data show that a specific splicing factor (SF), PTB (hnRNP I) modulates FADS AT abundance. In early 2012, we generated the first Fads3-/- (null) mouse to investigate the as-yet-unknown function of this extensively alternatively spliced gene. AT represent a novel, essential paradigm for omega-3 metabolic control mediated in non-coding regions. Present knowledge of regulatory mechanisms neglecting AT are necessarily incomplete because >95% of human genes produce AT, including the FADS genes. The overall goal is to discover the regulation and function of FADS AT and some of their genetic control via mechanistic investigation. Hypothesis 1: FADS AT are modulated by dietary PUFA and by hormones via splicing factors (SF) in a manner consistent with enhanced catalysis (e.g. FADS1AT1) or inhibition (e.g. FADS3 AT) of desaturation. Hypothesis 2: FADS AT modulation is related to SNPs and haplotypes via splicing factors. Specific Aim 1. Define the transcription start sites (TSS) and UTR of FADS CS and AT. (a) Determine the promoters and full length open reading frames (ORFs) of FADS CS and AT with RNA-Seq using human liver. (b) Determine FADS transcript modulation by ratios of dietary PUFA in mice and by hormones in human cells, thereby establishing AT as intermediate biomarkers for LCPUFA biosynthesis. (c) Develop and implement RNAi of splicing factors and inhibition of their phosphorylation to investigate SF modulation of FADS transcripts, and fatty acid desaturation and composition. Specific Aim 2. Discovery of FADS AT function(s) and modulation. (a) Based on RNA-Seq and RNAi results: (i) Transfect human cells to test for activation or inhibition by specific AT. (ii) Construct vectors for functional studies in human cels, using full length ORF. (b) Characterize the overt and molecular/biochemical phenotype of Fads3 null mice. (c) Investigate the prevalence of human SNPs and haplotypes related to PUFA biosynthesis. Relevance to human health. Understanding of FADS AT regulation, function, and influence on LCPUFA bio-synthesis will enable mechanistic evaluation of interindividual variability in LCPUFA biosynthesis. Human genetic variation and metabolic conditions responsive to omega-3 LCPUFA supplementation will be identified."
"9383184","PROJECT SUMMARY  Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive and irreversible interstitial lung disease with a mean life expectancy of only 3 to 5 years after diagnosis. It is one of approximately 7,000 rare diseases. The disease typically occurs in individuals between the ages of 50 and 70 years old. The abnormal activation of local resident pulmonary fibroblasts is believed to be a major factor driving the fibrotic progression in IPF. However, the molecular mechanisms leading to the fibroblast activation are not fully understood. The long-term goal of this project is to elucidate the pathogenesis of IPF and thus to advance the development of an effective pharmacological therapy. The objective of the current application is to understand how long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) regulate pulmonary fibroblast activation in IPF. lncRNAs are non-protein-coding RNAs with a size of > 200 nucleotides that have been increasingly recognized for their importance in regulating various biological processes. Although small non-coding RNAs, such as microRNAs, have been extensively studied in IPF, very little is known regarding the roles of lncRNAs in the pathogenesis of pulmonary diseases, such as IPF. Through the analyses of RNA_seq datasets, we have identified human fetal-lethal non-coding developmental regulatory RNA (FENDRR) as an lncRNA that is down-regulated in the fibrotic lungs of patients with IPF. Our preliminary studies have shown that TGF?1 and hypoxia reduce FENDRR expression in pulmonary fibroblasts and that the overexpression of FENDRR inhibits fibroblast activation. We have also demonstrated that FENDRR reduces cellular iron content, and that iron depletion decreases pro-fibrotic miR- 214 expression. In addition, we have shown that FENDRR is a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) that functions as a sponge for miR-214. Finally, we have provided evidence that adenovirus-mediated gene transfer of FENDRR into mouse lungs attenuates bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis in preventive and therapeutic modes. The central hypothesis of this project is that the down-regulation of FENDRR in IPF contributes to pulmonary fibrosis by promoting fibroblast activation via increased expression and activity of pro-fibrotic miR-214 due to iron overload and a reduced competition between FENDRR and miR-214, respectively. Aim I will delineate the transcriptional regulation of FENDRR by the TGF? and hypoxia signaling pathways. Aim II will define the functional roles and molecular mechanisms of FENDRR in fibroblast activation. Aim III will determine the therapeutic efficacy and mechanisms of action of Fendrr in pre-clinical pulmonary fibrosis mouse models. The proposed studies will define novel mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of IPF."
"9544604","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The brain is one of the most metabolically active organs with glucose representing the most important, but not the only, source of energy and carbon. Like all cancers, glioblastoma, the most prevalent and malignant primary brain tumor, requires a continuous source of energy and molecular resources for new cell production with a preferential use of aerobic glycolysis, recognized as the Warburg effect. Aerobic glycolysis diminishes the need for oxygen, while inefficient liberation of energy permits residual carbons to be shunted to produce cellular components. Glioblastoma is a highly lethal cancer type with almost all targeted therapeutics tested to date showing minimal to no sustained clinical benefit. The failure to achieve cure has many causes, but we and others have linked self-renewing, highly tumorigenic glioma stem cells (GSCs) to therapeutic resistance, invasion into normal tissues, and increased angiogenesis. Targeting GSCs can inhibit tumor growth and sensitize tumors to conventional therapies. In this application, two leading GSC laboratories with complementary research foci have joined forces to examine the relationship between GSCs and metabolism. Isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) mutations directly link transformation and metabolism in low grade gliomas and secondary glioblastoma, but these mutations are relatively rare in glioblastoma, suggesting that alternative metabolic alterations are likely present. Our two groups have interrogated GSC glucose metabolism within the cellular hierarchy (intratumoral heterogeneity) and between tumors (intertumoral heterogeneity). In preliminary studies, we found that nutrient restriction mimicking tumor conditions enriches for GSCs through preferential GSC survival and acquisition of stem- like features in differentiated cells. GSCs respond to low glucose by preferential uptake of glucose through the expression of a specialized, high affinity neuronal glucose transporter (Glut3). Glut3 enriches for GSCs and targeting Glut3 expression attenuates stem cell self-renewal and tumor growth. GSCs are not static, but rather evolve during treatment. GSCs from proneural and mesenchymal glioblastomas display differential gene expression profiles and radiation sensitivity with increased glycolytic activity in mesenchymal GSCs. Radiation induces a proneural-to-mesenchymal transition associated with activation of glycolytic metabolism and aldehyde dehydrogenase activity. As selected metabolic nodes are amenable to therapeutic targeting, we hypothesize that the Warburg effect causally contributes to glioma heterogeneity through cellular hierarchical and clonal evolution mechanisms. In this application, the first aim will determine the tumor microenvironment reprograms glucose uptake to instruct glioblastoma cellular hierarchies. As an independent yet complementary study, the second aim will determine the role of glycolytic reprogramming in the evolution of glioma stem cells to acquire therapeutic resistance. The ultimate goals of these studies are to establish a new concept by incorporating both the cellular hierarchical theory and the clonal evolution theory to better clarify the mechanism of tumor heterogeneity and to establish targeted therapies for distinct molecules that are responsible for a gain of resistance t current therapies. The proposed studies, when completed, will challenge the current research and clinical practice hurdles and will create a firm path to translation by developing a novel strategy to target the newly identified metabolic alterations in glioblastomas."
"9469892","PROJECT SUMMARY  The long-term goal of this research is to develop technologies that facilitate motor learning after stroke. Motor learning is an essential component of stroke rehabilitation, as stroke-survivors must adapt to a changed nervous system to generate desired movements. While much emphasis has been placed on teaching volitional actions to stroke survivors, unimpaired motor control relies heavily on involuntary sensorimotor feedback pathways that can influence motor outputs as required to adapt to novel tasks or environments. In particular, feedback pathways that generate rapid motor responses to proprioceptive or visual inputs play crucial role in motor learning by guiding corrective motor responses. Rapid motor corrections by proprioceptive and visual pathways can serve as a potentially powerful tool to guide motor rehabilitation after stroke, but first, a more complete assessment of post-stroke deficits in these pathways ? specifically their impacts on motor learning ? is required. Therefore, this proposal will focus on quantifying post-stroke impairments in proprioceptive and visual pathways that contribute to rapid motor responses, and determining how such impairments affect motor learning in this population. Specifically, Aim 1 will investigate how stroke alters the relative contributions of proprioceptive and visual pathways to rapid motor responses. A virtual reality and robotic system will be used to perturb sensory information during reaching to quantitatively assess the degree to which proprioceptive and visual contributions to rapid motor responses remain independent after stroke. Aim 2 will investigate how the integrity of proprioceptive and visual contributions to rapid motor responses affects motor learning after stroke. A virtual reality and robotic system will be used to create training environments that amplify the proprioceptive or visual consequences of reaching errors. Using these training environments, I will examine whether the ability to adapt rapid motor responses is impaired after stroke, and how such impairment influences motor learning. Subjects with a range of impairment levels, assessed by traditional clinical scales, will be included in this study to determine how rapid, corrective motor behaviors and learning are affected by stroke severity. The proposed study will elucidate the role of involuntary sensorimotor feedback pathways during motor learning following stroke, and provide a means to quantify subject-specific impairments in these pathways. Together, the results from the proposed study will inform the development of patient-specific treatments for this population."
"9526746","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Heterochromatin is a tightly packaged form of DNA that is associated with transcriptional repression. It is essential for normal development and genome stability. Abnormal heterochromatin is implicated in the pathology of the human developmental syndrome Immunodeficiency, Centromere region instability and Facial abnormalities (ICF), the degenerative muscle wasting disease Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD) and is likely to facilitate aneuploidy in cancer. Heterochromatin is required for a number of essential biological processes including normal chromosome segregation, sex chromosome dosage compensation, monoallelic expression of imprinted genes and transcriptional silencing of parasitic DNA elements. To date, much of our molecular understanding of heterochromatin regulation is derived from genetic screens performed in plants, insects and fungi. Mouse mutations in genes identified in screens from these organisms demonstrate conservation of many aspects of heterochromatin regulation, including critical roles for histone 3 lysine 9 methylation and the heterochromatin protein HP1. However, there are differences between heterochromatin regulation in vertebrates and other model organisms. For example, the DNA modification 5-methylcytosine is an essential component of heterochromatin in vertebrate species but is not present in the genomes of Schizosaccharomyces pombe or Drosophila melanogaster. Zebrafish offer a powerful combination of genetic, molecular and developmental tools that allow for innovative approaches to the study of vertebrate heterochromatin. This proposal uses these tools to define molecular pathways that regulate heterochromatin at repetitive sequences and to identify requirements for the involved genes in normal development and tissue homeostasis. In a small screen for regulators of zebrafish heterochromatin, our laboratory identified several genes including zbtb24 and nsd1a. ZBTB24 is mutated in humans with ICF syndrome type 2 and NSD1 is mutated in the human developmental disorder Sotos syndrome. However, roles for the encoded proteins in heterochromatin regulation have not been experimentally addressed. The proposed research will define endogenous sites of heterochromatin that depend on these factors and identify the molecular functions of these proteins in heterochromatin regulation. Based on early success, more extensive candidate and unbiased loss-of-function screens will be performed to identify and define the molecular functions of additional genes that regulate heterochromatin in the zebrafish embryo. Elucidation of the molecular and developmental requirements for these genes is expected to uncover novel mechanisms for heterochromatin regulation that are conserved in vertebrate species and which are relevant to human development and disease states."
"9517350","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Depression is a severe and common mental disorder and often coexists with metabolic disorders such as diabetes. Therefore, the identification and characterization of therapeutic targets that are potentially beneficial for the treatment of both depression and diabetes would be of great clinical significance. Adiponectin, a hormone secreted almost exclusively by white adipose tissue, is well recognized as an anti-diabetic adipokine. We have demonstrated that adiponectin insufficiency increases susceptibility to depression-like symptoms. By contrast, administration of exogenous adiponectin to the brain produces antidepressant-like effects in normal weight mice and in obese diabetic mice, suggesting a critical role for adiponectin in depressive-like behaviors. The goal of this project i to define the molecular and cellular mechanisms of adiponectin actions on depressive behaviors. Adiponectin receptors, AdipoR1 and AidpoR2, display distinct expression patterns in the hippocampus and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), two key brain regions implicated in depression and the therapeutic actions of antidepressants. Central injection of adiponectin induces neuronal activation and stimulates p38MAPK, an upstream activator of the inhibitory phosphorylation site of GSK-3b. Moreover, adiponectin has been shown to stimulate hippocampal neurogenesis in vitro. Based upon these findings, we hypothesize that adiponectin regulates depressive behaviors in a brain-region, receptor-specific manner through distinct molecular and cellular mechanisms. We propose to determine the region-specific roles of AdipoR1 and AdipoR2 in the development of depressive-like behaviors and in mediating the antidepressant-like effect of adiponectin, identify the signaling cascade that mediates actions of adiponectin on depressive-like behaviors, and determine whether neurogenesis contributes to the behavioral effect of adiponectin. These studies will provide novel insights into adipokine regulation of mood-related behaviors and lead to the development of novel therapies for depression."

"9444137","Project Summary Social recognition in mammals is a complex biological process that necessitates communication between neural circuits mediating cognitive processes such as discrimination of social stimuli and those underlying expression of affiliation or avoidance behaviors. Circuit alterations that impair social discrimination, social interaction or linkage of social discrimination with social interaction may underlie social recognition deficits seen in autism spectrum disorders and other psychiatric disorders. One general mechanism by which distinct behaviors such as reward seeking, social exploration and discrimination of social stimuli are orchestrated is through the actions of neuromodulators such as oxytocin (OT). Although a growing number of studies have begun to shed light on oxytocin receptor (Oxtr) signaling in the nucleus accumbens, lateral septum and prefrontal cortex in social interaction, the contribution of Oxtrs in the hippocampus to social memory is not known. This proposal seeks to identify (i) fundamental circuit mechanisms by which hippocampal Oxtr signaling promotes discrimination of social stimuli and, (ii) the neural pathways that link these computations with circuits that subserve social interaction. Towards these goals, we will harness viral and mouse conditional genetic tools, optogenetics, cellular ensemble imaging and behavior to precisely manipulate hippocampal Oxtr signaling with unprecedented spatial and temporal control and determine its contributions to social recognition. Insights gleaned from the proposed studies will shed light on how an ancient neuromodulator like OT has evolved to utilize basic memory-processing circuit mechanisms to perform discrimination of social stimuli. The significance of the studies lies in its potential to illuminate fundamental neural mechanisms underlying previously unrecognized roles of hippocampal Oxtr signaling in social recognition. Ultimately, these mechanisms may guide novel therapeutic strategies for promoting social recognition in disorders in which it is impaired."

"9538325","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There is a significant stigma attached to mental illness in the U.S. and this stigma is believed to contribute to an estimated 41% of individuals with serious mental illness who are not in treatment. To address this problem, California recently launched a $60 million publically-financed mental illness Stigma and Discrimination Reduction (SDR) initiative. The SDR draws from theories of mental illness stigma reduction and a growing but methodologically limited body of evidence examining similar efforts in other countries. The California initiative's centerpiece is a major social marketing campaign, supplemented by targeted local outreach to general audiences, stakeholders, and key influence groups. Activities are expected to reach millions of individuals across the state. Targeted outcomes are improved mental illness knowledge, reduced public stigma, and increased early identification and treatment-seeking for those with symptoms of mental illness. The effort has already been touted as a model for the nation. We propose to test the effects of the SDR initiative on CA adults experiencing mild to severe symptoms of mental distress by 1) tracking levels of mental illness related self-stigma and experienced discrimination in this population from mid to post initiative, 2) testing whether any shifts in illness recognition, treatment seeking, and functioning in this group are greater than shifts experienced by comparable individuals residing in other states, and 3) testing for processes explaining any observed shifts in self-stigma and treatment seeking. We plan to leverage data from a longitudinal survey of a representative sample of CA adults (N=1258) and a mid-initiative benchmarking survey of a representative sample of CA adults experiencing mental distress (N=1066), both conducted as part of the legislatively mandated evaluation of the SDR. We will supplement these with a post-initiative cross-sectional survey and data from the National Survey of Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) collected pre and post initiative. Propensity matching the NSDUH samples of California adults with NSDUH participants outside the state will provide an equivalent comparison. The research is a unique opportunity to test the effectiveness of a major mental health initiative, will enhance our scientiic understanding of stigma reduction efforts and their mechanisms of action, and have important implications for the design of future initiatives employing stigma reduction as a method of improving mental health."
"9396022","Project Summary Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a multifactorial disease that involves both a genetic and an environmental component. Approximately 0.5-1% of the population in the U.S. is afflicted with RA. Current treatments, including biologics such as anti-tumor necrosis factor-?, are effective, but only in about 50-60% of RA patients. In addition, their use is associated with severe adverse effects, such as immune suppression that renders RA patients more vulnerable to infections. In order to develop better therapeutics, a more comprehensive understanding of the pathogenesis of RA is required. Our lab has previously shown that there is a dynamic change in gene expression at different phases of adjuvant-induced arthritis (AA) in Lewis rats. Furthermore, a traditional Chinese medicine celastrus and its bioactive component celastrol can suppress AA. However, their mechanisms of action have not been fully defined. Micro-RNAs (miRNAs) are short (~19-22 nucleotides long), non-coding RNA sequences that repress the activity of specific genes. These short sequences either inhibit translation or cause degradation of the target messenger RNA (mRNA). We hypothesize that miRNAs play a vital role in the development and progression of autoimmune arthritis, and that specific miRNAs can also serve as biomarkers for this disease. Moreover, we suggest that celastrus/celastrol mediates its effect in part by regulating the levels of specific miRNAs. Aim 1. To define the miRNA profiles of arthritic Lewis rats at early and late phases of AA, and identify significantly altered and relevant miRNAs as well as their potential target genes that are involved in arthritis pathogenesis. Aim 2. To identify specific miRNAs whose expression is significantly altered following treatment of arthritic rats with celastrus or its bioactive component celastrol, and to define the role of those miRNAs in mediating the anti-arthritic activity of these herbal complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) products. Using total RNA purified from the draining lymph node cells and the synovial-infiltrating cells of Lewis rats following an arthritogenic challenge, with or without treatment with celastrus/celastrol, we plan to use miRNA microarray to identify miRNAs of interest. To further validate the selected miRNA, we will transfect a cell line with miRNA mimic/antagonist to over-/under-express, respectively the miRNA of interest. Then we will employ qRT-PCR, western blotting, and immunochemistry to determine their effects on target genes associated with arthritis pathogenesis as well as their control by herbal CAM therapy. We believe that our results would not only advance the understanding of arthritis pathogenesis, but also help develop novel therapeutics for RA."
"9468899","PROJECT SUMMARY Normal aging is associated with pervasive deficits in sensorimotor function. According to the dedifferentiation hypothesis of aging, these age-related impairments are partially attributable to decreases in the distinctiveness of neural representations. Simply put, as we age, different mental states increasingly rely on shared neural substrates and thus evoke relatively similar (rather than distinct) patterns of brain activation. These less distinctive neural representations lead to less efficient neural processing and undermine behavioral performance. Consistent with this hypothesis, neural activation patterns in older adults are often more bilateral than those in young adults (a reduction in hemispheric asymmetry in older adults). Furthermore, our group has found that neural activation patterns in response to different visual stimuli or motor actions are significantly less distinctive in older compared to younger adults. We also found that older adults with more distinctive neural representations perform significantly better than others on a range of behavioral tasks. Informed by this previous work, we propose to investigate the neural and behavioral consequences of age-related dedifferentiation in the somatosensory system. First, we will use functional MRI to examine the distinctiveness of somatosensory representations during tactile stimulation in both young and old adults (Aim 1). We predict that these representations will be less distinctive (more dedifferentiated) in the older participants. Second, we will collect a battery of behavioral measurements of tactile performance in the same participants to examine the relationship between somatosensory neural distinctiveness and behavior (Aim 2). We predict that reduced somatosensory distinctiveness will be associated with impaired tactile performance. Third, we will use repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) to test whether age-related recruitment of ipsilateral somatosensory cortex is helpful or harmful to behavioral performance (Aim 3). If reduced hemispheric asymmetry in older adults is compensatory, then stimulation of ipsilateral somatosensory cortex should impair their tactile performance. The proposed studies will provide novel insight into how the brain changes with age, and whether those changes are linked to impaired behavior. Findings from this research could provide the basis for novel interventions to prolong functional independence for older adults."

"9355050","DESCRIPTION:     Rationale and Preliminary Data: We will conduct a validation and characterization of the diffusion tensor imaging changes and histopathology of the cervical spinal cord following experimental thoracic contusion injury. Conventional MRI scans to detect edema using T2-weighted imaging are no better at predicting the degree of recovery in patients with spinal cord injury (SCI) than a traditional neurological examination. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is showing promise as a prognostic imaging biomarker in SCI. However, DTI at the injury site is often hampered by artifacts from spinal fixation hardware. Our preclinical studies in the rat have demonstrated robust DTI alterations in the high cervical spinal cord (hcDTI) that correlate with injury severity and functional recovery. Thus, our preliminary data indicates that diffusivity in te high cervical spinal cord, as measured by DTI, is a potential biomarker of neural injury in SCI. While promising, a more comprehensive validation is necessary for accurate diagnosis in human SCI. To that end, we will employ our preclinical model of thoracic contusion injury to advance the understanding of the DTI changes in the cervical cord as markers of injury. Hypothesis and Specific Aims: We hypothesize that advanced MRI of the high cervical spinal cord is an accurate biomarker of tissue damage and injury severity that is prognostic of outcome. To examine this hypothesis, we will employ a rat model of thoracic contusion spinal cord injury and perform in vivo MRI, functional assessments, and histopathology. We will test our hypothesis by performing diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI) and quantitative T2 (qT2) to improve the prognostic ability in the acute setting (Aim 1), establish these measures as a surrogate maker of tissue damage at the site of injury (Aim 2), and elucidate the pathophysiological mechanisms of MRI changes remote from the site of injury using gold-standard histopathology (Aim 3). To accomplish these aims, a multidisciplinary approach using in vivo DKI and qT2, quantitative histopathological analysis, and functional assessments will provide a comprehensive understanding of the relationship between noninvasive imaging markers and their biological underpinnings and functional implications. We hypothesize that detection of injury in the acute setting will be enhanced by DKI and qT2 MRI techniques. Furthermore, it is believed that the cervical cord DTI changes accurately reflect the degree of injury at the site of injury assessed by the amount of spared white matter. Finally, it is postulatd that in addition to axonal degeneration and demyelination, astrocyte reactivity is a prominent feature of injury that occurs distant from the injury and relates to the degree of functional recovery. Collectively, these studies will establish and validate hcDTI as a sensitive biomarker of SCI with the potential to improve prognostication and will guide translation to human SCI."
"9539135","This research project is centered on the hypothesis that ribonucleic acid (RNA) structure and RNA-chromatin associated protein interactions play crucial roles in maintaining genome stability. Non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) serve as key regulators of gene expression and are known to physically associate with chromatin-associated proteins to organize changes in gene architecture during specific development stages of the cell. A subset of these RNA-protein interactions are linked to ageing, cancer metastasis, and neuronal development. As genomic approaches begin to identify RNA-protein associations and their links to cancer, there remains limited information about epigenetic-based RNA binding proteins at the molecular level. We seek to understand how RNA functionally interacts with the lysine specific demethylase-1 (LSD1) protein enzyme. LSD1 is an essential histone methylation regulator and has oncogenic properties in several cancers including: prostate, bladder, neuroblastoma, lung, and breast cancer. LSD1 is implicated in cancer through its vast interaction network. LSD1 also interacts with many RNA molecules involved in cell differentiation and can function to regulate conserved RNA-mediated repressor complexes in the cell. An ncRNA, termed TERRA, enables LSD1 to interact with a DNA double strand break repair enzyme at the ends of chromosomes (telomeres), demonstrating that the RNA binding properties of LSD1 are important for gene regulation. TERRA is a regulatory RNA that is transcribed from yeast to humans and can adopt a non-canonical guanine quadruplex (GQ) RNA architecture in vitro and in vivo. TERRA?s abundance in the cell correlates with progressive telomere shortening and the stabilization of telomeric heterochromatin. We hypothesize that RNA-LSD1 assemblies play key roles in gene expression and propose that GQ RNAs serve as crucial regulators of chromatin-associated proteins. The proposed studies will 1) elucidate the biochemical and structural mechanisms of a TERRA RNA-LSD1 interaction and 2) examine how non-canonical structured RNAs contact LSD1 to influence telomeric regulatory pathways. The long-term goal of this project is to understand how RNA structure influences LSD1 regulatory networks. Results from these studies will provide insight into the mechanisms of RNA-based epigenetic regulation and serves as a starting point in the development of ?tailored? probes that target histone methylation regulators in a pathway-specific manner."
"9422165","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Intracellular infections based in the lung alveolar macrophage population remain one of the most challenging anti-infective settings and unmet medical needs. Diseases such as tuberculosis, legionellosis, tularemia and melioidosis cause high mortality and morbidity costs around the globe. The long-term goal of this project is to develop and validate a new inhalable macromolecular therapeutic platform termed ?drugamers? that targets antibiotics and antibiotic drug combinations to the alveolar macrophage to better treat lung-based intracellular infections. A key new property of this platform, that currently does not exist in clinically available therapeutics and delivery systems, is the ability to engineer custom tailored pharmacokinetic (PK) drug release profiles in the alveolar compartment and targeted alveolar macrophages that match the required PK profiles of specific antibiotic classes and specific bacterial infection processes. To achieve this objective, the project brings together a multi-disciplinary team across polymer therapeutics, glycan targeting of alveolar macrophages, and clinical expertise in alveolar-based bacterial pathology and treatment. The initial therapeutic focus is on tularemia and melioidosis, with clinical investigators and access to BSL-3 human pathogen models and facilities. The proposal is structured around 4 specific aims to: (1) Synthetically construct mannose-targeted drugamers of fluoroquinolone, ?-lactam, and aminoglycoside drugs and drug combinations with controlled release profiles and architectural morphologies designed to optimize alveolar macrophage uptake. (2) Optimize the biocompatibility, alveolar macrophage targeting, and PK properties - measured by liquid chromatography ? mass spectrometry analysis - of the drugamer library in murine models based on known drug dosing profiles of these major classes of antibiotics. Select optimized drugamers based on these in vivo properties to carry forward into the surrogate models of tularemia and melioidosis of the next aim. (3) Evaluate in vivo bactericidal efficacy of the mannose-targeted drugamers selected through their winning properties in Aim 2. Drugamers administered by aerosoloization will be tested for their ability to achieve cures in highly lethal mouse disease models infected by controlled aerosolization of surrogate Francisella and Burholderia bacteria. (4) Highly effective drugamer designs selected in Aim 3 will be assessed in human pathogen mouse models using Francisella tularensis and Burkholderia pseudomallei at the University of Washington BSL3 select agent facility. If successful, this project will identify lead inhalation therapeutics for future clinical pathway development against tularemia and melioidosis. Because the drugamer platform is modular, it could also be developed against other unmet intracellular lung infection therapy needs, where the growing issue of drug resistance provides a compelling need for the tailored and combination dosing profiles of this platform."
"9470837","PROJECT SUMMARY  How sensory and motor signals are integrated in the brain to produce perception of object location remains poorly understood. Primary somatosensory cortex (S1) is a candidate site for sensorimotor integration that underlies object localization. Mouse S1 is a powerful system in which to uncover general principles and specific circuit implementations of sensorimotor integration that shape perception of object location. Revealing these will provide fundamental knowledge of healthy cortex function from which processing disruptions from stroke, spinal injury, and other neurological disorders may be more fully understood.  The long-term goal of this work is to understand cellular and circuit mechanisms underlying tactile perception. This proposal focuses on how S1 integrates sensory and motor signals during active touch behaviors. Head-fixed mice can determine the angular position of objects by active exploration with a single whisker. Sophisticated neural processing underlies this simple behavior, which makes it an excellent model system for dissecting circuit mechanisms of somatosensory integration. Several competing models exist for how the brain solves this task. They differ in the type, origin, and integration location of sensorimotor signals used. Distinguishing between these models is critical for understanding the role internal motor signals in cortical circuits play in construction of tactile perception. Prior studies failed to do so because of limitations in task design and quantification of behavioral variation. This proposal overcomes these limitations with innovative approaches that include an improved localization task, high-speed sensorimotor tracking, cell type- specific electrophysiology, calcium imaging, sophisticated decoding models, and closed-loop optogenetics.  The overall objective of this proposal is to distinguish between sensorimotor integration models by quantifying behavior, identifying candidate codes for object location in S1, how these are constructed, and their influence on perception. Our central hypothesis is that object location is encoded by the set of excitatory neurons activated by touch in L5B of S1, and that object location tuning in L5B cells requires both thalamic input and motion-subtracted touch signals from L4 of S1. We further hypothesize that M1 input amplifies L5B activity without affecting object location tuning. This hypothesis is supported by our preliminary data including cell-type and layer-specific recordings in S1 and optogenetic circuit manipulation during object localization. The hypothesis will be tested by pursuing three Specific Aims. 1) Identify candidate codes for object location in S1 neurons. 2) Identify the origin of signals contributing to object location tuning in S1 neurons. 3) Test object localization models with closed-loop optogenetic manipulation of S1 circuits. The contribution of the proposed research will be significant because it will generate detailed knowledge about the neural dynamics in S1 that underlie touch perception, uncover general principles of sensorimotor integration and specific cortical circuit implementations of that integration during behavior, and package it all into a publically accessible resource.  "
"9426275","PROJECT SUMMARY Individual differences in the quantity and quality of parent talk and individual differences in infant visual attention predict later vocabulary development, which in turn has the cascading consequences of later cognitive development and school achievement. The proposed research studies how infants prior to their first birthday begin to learn object names, and does so in a unique approach, focusing on how visual information from the infant perspective coincide with parent naming and on how infant looking behavior selects the data to be aggregated and how that selected data changes incrementally in statistical learning. Toward this goal, we will collect a corpus of infant-perspective scenes from 8-12-month-old infants as they play with their parent in a toy room and as parents naturally name objects during play. We will analyze the referential ambiguity of the scenes that co-occur with parent naming events, by showing the scenes to infants and tracking their gaze direction in free viewing. We will use the gaze data to quantify ambiguity in terms of the uncertainty, correctness, and informativeness of the scenes as to the intended object referent. We will then construct training sets for cross-situational learning experiments from the collected scenes by manipulating the mix of high and low ambiguity trials. We will test a series of hypotheses about how infants aggregate information to learn multiple object names.  Moreover, we will feed the trial-by-trial gaze data of individual infants to models to predict final learning outcomes, with the goal of specifying attentional and memory processes that support learning. Our overarching aim of the project is to show that the infant-perspective scenes co- occurring with early naming events have properties that guide and train infant visual attention and in so doing support the learning of names and their referents through the aggregation of information across multiple naming events."
