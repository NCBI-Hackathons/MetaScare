"9572545","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):          Pharmacogenomics of risk factors and therapies outcomes for kidney disease Kidney disease is highly prevalent among US Veterans, affecting more than 200,000 patients and it is associated with increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Pharmacologic treatment of major risk factors, including type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D), hypertension (HT), and immunosuppression after kidney transplantation (KTx), remain the mainstays of preventing chronic kidney disease (CKD), progression to end stage renal disease (ESRD) and premature death. However, wide heterogeneity in both the pharmacologic response to therapies and risk factors limits the full potential benefit of therapy. The overall aim of this proposal is to use genome wide association studies (GWAS) to promote personalized medicine for patients at risk of incident and progressive CKD by increasing our understanding in the following three domains: 1) The pharmacogenomics of metformin for the treatment of T2D: Metformin is the recommended first line therapy for the treatment of diabetes and is superior for reducing CV death and CKD incidence compared to other alternatives. However, marked inter individual variability in the glycemic response to metformin exists5,6. There have been few genome wide association studies and these are limited by the sample size. The NIH recently highlighted the need to improve our understanding of the genetic determinants of the glycemic response to metformin, which will allow personalized prescription of metformin and potentially prevention of diabetes complications like CKD. 2) The Genetic determinants of HT and Resistant HT (RHT): Hypertension (HT) is a major contributor to loss of kidney function, especially among patients with RHT (defined as failure to achieve BP targets with three or more drugs or success with four or more drugs). In the VA population, hypertension prevalence approaches 70%. The prevalence of RHT has been estimated at 9-17% with strong disparities for African Americans (AA). GWAS have identified in African ancestry few novel loci involved in BP traits. However, despite the severe long-term effects of uncontrolled HT and RHT on health, no GWAS studies of RHT risk have been published. 3) The pharmacogenomics of immunosuppressive therapy (IT) after KTx: Calcineurin inhibitors (CNI), such as tacrolimus, are the backbone of IT regimens, and are essential for long-term kidney graft survival by preventing rejection. The benefits of IT are mitigated by loss of kidney function due to under dosing or nephrotoxicity due to over dosing. We have shown that blood concentrations of tacrolimus are influenced by cytochrome P450 3A5 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs776746. This study will further expand our knowledge in genetic determinants of tacrolimus levels, which are essential for personalized dosing of tacrolimus in KTx and prevention of rejection or CNI nephrotoxicity. In this proposal, we will leverage the resources from the Million Veterans Program (MVP) genetic data linked to the Veterans Administration national electronic medical record, which provide an unprecedented large cohort, to perform a series of GWAS to discover and validate the genetic determinants of the pharmacologic response to these key therapies and risk factors. We will replicate our results in the Vanderbilt DNA Repository. We will accomplish our goals with the following specific aims: Aim 1: To evaluate the genetic determinants of the response to metformin therapy on glycemic lowering response using the lowest HbA1c in the 18 months following an incident metformin prescription. Aim 2: To evaluate the genetic determinants of HT and RHT Aim 3: To evaluate the genetic variants associated with the pharmacokinetic response to tacrolimus in KTx recipients by using routinely measured blood concentrations for therapeutic drug monitoring and dose titration. The current proposal will promote personalized medicine in the VA system for the care provided to patients with or at risk of CKD. We have assembled a multidisciplinary team and we are well poised to conduct the work proposed."
"9379447","Abstract Malarial infections are still one of today's great global health problems, with nearly 600,000 deaths and millions of new infections occurring annually. Plasmodium parasites (the causative agents of malaria) are transmitted between a mosquito vector and their mammalian host, and they have developed intricate systems to adequately prepare for transmission, and to then to firmly establish an infection. Because relatively few parasites are passed between the host and the mosquito vector, these two transmission events have long been prioritized as optimal points for interventions with drugs and vaccines. Recent work has demonstrated that Plasmodium parasites have evolved to use selective translational repression just prior to transmission events to store the mRNAs that it will need for the next steps of development. The adaptation of translational repression for these purposes is a logical choice, as the transmitted gametocytes and sporozoites cannot anticipate when they will be transmitted, and this system allows the parasite to always remain ready for that moment of transmission to occur. While some of the key proteins and mRNAs involved in these events have been identified, many important questions still remain. What proteins are responsible for selecting mRNAs for translational repression? What proteins act to repress them? What attributes of an mRNA will flag it to be selected for translational repression? In this proposed work, we will leverage new technological and experimental approaches to answer these questions, and by doing so, we will better understand the fundamental mechanisms that the parasite has evolved to be efficiently transmitted in both the gametocyte and sporozoite stages. Moreover, we will observe similarities and differences in how the parasite uses translational repression at these two stages in both rodent- infectious, and human-infectious parasites. Taken together, these findings will provide the first mechanistic studies of protein/RNA complexes in sporozoites, will allow a functional comparison across stages and species, and will highlight molecular components and functions that the parasite requires for transmission that may exploited in the future as targets for new therapeutic agents."
"9378383","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):          Here, we will determine if improved small molecules can protect the microtubule associated  protein tau from a pathogenic cascade caused by the molecular chaperone Hsc70. Tau accumulates  in  traumatic  brain  injury  (TBI),  leading  to  neurodegeneration  and  cognitive  deficits.  Active  Hsc70  binds  to  tau  just  after  microtubule  disruption  precipitated  by  bast-­induced  axonal  injury  and  then  directs tau along one of two paths: It either preserves tau, even when it is hyper-­phosphorylated, in  an effort to recycle it to microtubules, or it triages au for a specialized degradation system called  chaperone mediated autophagy (CMA).  While this seems appropriate in principle, tau is actually a problem for CMA.  It  gets  trapped  in  the  channel  called  LAMP2a,  and  then  it  is  cleaved  into  an  aggregation-­prone form that can seed further aggregation. So the mechanisms used by Hsc70 to triage tau are ineffective, and the overall outcome is its abnormal accumulation. We have shown that  just by inhibiting Hsc70 with small molecules, tau is sent for proteasomal clearance, which is more  effective  for  clearing  tau  than  CMA.  Therefore  we  predict  that  subverting  tau  away  from  CMA  processing  with  Hsc70  inhibitors  will  reduce  the  pathogenic  tau  burden,  and  could  possibly  be  a  therapeutic strategy for TBI, especially immediately following blast TBI when tau fate is determined.  We also predict that we will be able to use these small molecules to define the mechanism through  which  Hsc70  makes  decisions  about  tau  fate.  Our  team  has  developed  an  extensive  suite  of  compounds  that  reduce  tau  levels  in  cells  through  this mechanism  and  a  number  of  tools  to  investigate  mechanism  of  action.  Therefore,  we  will  be  able  to  evaluate  both  the  efficacy  of  this  approach for in vivo application whilealso dissecting the mechanisms involved in Hsc70 triage of  tau. We have recently shown that Hsc70 inhibition by rhodacyanines can effectively lower tau in cells  and  in  brain  tissue.  This  scaffold  has  been  modified  to  improve  anti-­tau  potency  and  pharmacokinetics, even permitting BBB permeability. Thus, this compound family could hold promise  as a viable drug candidate for tauopathies. We used this information to create a library of structurally  diverse  derivatives  of  the  rhodacyanine  backbone.  But  we  do  not  know  if  they  have  improved  neuronal anti-­tau potency or pharmacokinetic profiles. We hypothesize that these properties can be  improved. We propose a step-­wise advancement process to test the potency, toxicity, efficacy and  ADME/pharmacokinetic profiles of these derivatives. In addition to their potential therapeutic utility,  the rhodacyanines provide excellent tool molecules to examine mechanisms of Hsc70-­directed tau  trafficking and turnover. We will also employ innovative cell-­based assays, shRNA vector screening,  and our developed compound toolbox to clarify how Hsc70 makes tau triage decisions and how they  relate  to  its  pathobiology.  The  proposed  studies  will  hopefully  form  the  foundation  for  a  viable  treatment approach in TBI."
"9589987","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Obesity is of epidemic proportions and adipose tissue (fat) is central to the manifestation of the accompanying metabolic dysfunction (diabetes, cardiovascular disease, atherosclerosis, and hypertension). The global prevalence of obesity is approximately 15% and in the United States more than two thirds of the population is considered overweight. Fat mass can expand from 2?3% to 60?70% of overall body weight in response to caloric excess. Adipose tissue is comprised of two cell types: the cells that store lipids, adipocytes, and the cells that can divide and have the potential to make new adipocytes, fat progenitor cells. Fat accumulation occurs in two ways, one is to expand lipid storage in existing adipocytes and the second is to increase (proliferate) the fat stem cell population in turn creating new adipocytes. Despite the important health implications of obesity our understanding about the adipocyte stem compartment and its niche (the specialized microenvironment that controls all aspects of stem/progenitor cell biology) remains undefined. Our recent studies have identified and localized fat stem cells to the blood vessel wall in the adipose tissue thus serving as the niche. Much remains unknown about how these progenitor cells divide and migrate, how they adhere to the blood vessel, how they are retained at the vasculature, and how these cells undergo adipocyte differentiation. Furthermore, it is unclear how disrupting these two compartments alter adiposity and systemic metabolism. This proposal aims to explore these questions using cell culture and mouse models to address the interaction between adipose stem cells and their niche. An important regulator of this biology is platelet derived growth factor receptor ? (PDGFR?), which I found to be upregulated in vascular residing adipose progenitor cells. Aim 1 of this proposal uses cell culture modeling to manipulate PDGFR?   expression and monitor adipose stem cell function (proliferation migration and differentiation) and niche interaction. My preliminary data suggest that PDGFR? is a critical regulator of adipose progenitor cell proliferation, migration and adipocyte formation. Aim 2 addresses the physiological consequence of deleting PDGFR? in adipose stem cells on adiposity and glucose metabolism. Preliminary studies show that deleting PDGFR in the adipose lineage results in adipose stem cell?niche mis?localization in turn leading to fat loss Aim 3 takes a clinical approach to address if pharmacologically targeting PDGFR alters adipose stem cells locality thereby blocking adiposity and improving glucose sensitivity. Preliminary data mirror the genetic deletion studies of PDGFR?, highlighting clinical utility. These findings will e of great importance for two reasons: 1) they address significant biological questions into how adipose stem cells interact with their niche, communicate with their niche and expand their niche and 2) they will show that pharmacologically targeting this communication network between adipose progenitor cells and the niche reduces adiposity but improves glucose sensitivity, a highly sought?after therapy to combat obesity."
"9598003","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The olfactory system is unusual in retaining a high level of plasticity throughout life, enabling olfactory circuits to regenerate following damage. Ou long-term goal is to determine how adult olfactory circuits balance this high level of plasticity with functional stability. One major contributor to the regenerative capacity of the olfactory system is lifelong neurogenesis of olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) from stem cells in the nose. OSNs transmit sensory input to neurons in the olfactory bulb, where odor information is processed before being sent to olfactory cortical areas. However, the process by which new OSNs functionally incorporate into adult olfactory bulb circuits has been unclear. Understanding this process will be crucial in designing effective stem cell-based therapeutic strategies to repai damaged neural circuits in conditions such as neurodegenerative disease, stroke and traumatic brain injury. We will use a transgenic strategy to label and manipulate the activity of immature OSNs, in order to determine their role in olfactory bulb function and plasticity. First, using optogenetic photoactivation and electrophysiological recording in olfactory bulb slices, we will identify the olfactory bulb neurons with which immature OSNs form synaptic connections. Next, using in vivo 2-photon calcium imaging in combination with odor stimulation and optogenetic activation and silencing, we will determine the contribution made by immature OSNs to olfactory bulb output via mitral and tufted cells. Finally, using in vivo 2-photon imaging of synapses, we will determine the rate of recovery of immature and mature OSN synapse turnover following restoration of odor input. Successful completion of the proposed research will reveal the functional impact of incorporation of an endogeneous population of stem cell-derived neurons into adult neural circuits."
"9378384","Coronary artery disease is the principal cause of myocardial infarction (MI) and a leading cause of hospitalization and mortality in the veteran population. A consequence of MI is congestive heart failure (CHF), which is secondary to defective myocardial remodeling post-infarct. Recent studies have demonstrated a significant role for inflammation and immune cells in cardiac remodeling, particularly infiltrating monocyte/macrophage cells in cardiac repair. We recently determined that the oral immunosuppressant FTY720 is cardioprotective and increases survival in mouse models of coronary ligation and accelerated atherosclerosis leading to heart failure. While FTY720 has been shown to exert direct protective cell signaling effects in cardiac myocytes, its effects on immune cells, which result in cardioprotection have not been delineated. Our proposal focuses on our central hypothesis that cardiac ischemic injury initiates an inflammatory response that promotes abnormal cardiac remodeling which can be interrupted by immune modulation. Our proposal will determine specific changes in immune cells following FTY720 treatment that correlate with improved outcomes and determine if an optimal window for protective immune modulation exists following an ischemic event. By identifying specific changes induced by immune modulation, we will determine mechanisms that initiate beneficial cardioprotective immune responses that will be useful to target therapeutically and identify biomarkers that reflect the pathological aspects of the immune responses to MI. We will investigate the hypothesis that FTY720 improves cardiac repair following an ischemic event by altering the influx, phenotype and function of cardiac monocyte-derived macrophages. We will explore potential cardioprotective mechanisms for FTY720 effects: 1) a direct effect of FTY720 on macrophage polarization and/or 2) a primary effect of FTY720 on lymphocyte egress. We will also determine whether a short, critical period of FTY720-driven immune modulation can improve outcomes in an ischemia-reperfusion model. Aim 1: Determine if FTY720 treatment alters post-infarct cardiac macrophage phenotype  and function. Aim 2: Determine if cardio-protective effects of FTY720 against ischemic injury are  dependent on B lymphocyte trafficking. Aim 3: Determine if a limited window of FTY720 treatment is cardioprotective following  ischemic injury. Our multi-PI proposal leverages the expertise of established investigators with diverse areas of expertise in cardiac remodeling, immunity and macrophage biology. Together we are well positioned to explore how modulation of immunity can impact and improve cardiac repair. Significantly, our findings will define mechanisms by which FTY720 improves post-ischemic cardiac remodeling and survival, which could lead to new therapeutics to improve repair post-MI and decrease CHF. Our project is novel in that it seeks to define a mechanism of beneficial immune modulation in the post-ischemia setting and will identify how FTY720 alters cardiac inflammation post-ischemia/reperfusion injury and the cell types responsible for cardioprotection."
"9487868","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         The initial event in glucocorticoid (GC)-induced osteonecrosis, in many cases, is death of bone-synthesizing osteoblasts. Our preliminary work shows that this osteoblast death, at least in major part, is not directly caused by the GC. Bone growth and survival is regulated by many systems, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) being of critical importance. Developing osteoblasts, prominent in in high turnover bone such as femoral head trabecular bone, express the adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) receptor. We discovered that osteoblasts express VEGF strongly in response to ACTH. Continuous steroid treatment reduces ACTH to very low levels. In rabbits with high-dose GC, we showed that intermittent administration of ACTH greatly reduced osteonecrosis. Our hypothesis is that ACTH is a key regulator of bone growth and survival, particularly in regions with rapid bone turnover. However, mesenchymal stem cells or osteoblasts express VEGF receptors and ACTH receptors. Further, our pilot studies show that VEGF increases growth and differentiation or osteoblasts. Because ACTH is one of several factors that regulate VEGF production in bone, systematic study is needed to determine how ACTH, VEGF, and other regulatory pathways interact in bone.    Gaps in understanding include that downstream actions of ACTH in bone cells are poorly understood. The interactions of ACTH with other systems that regulate VEGF are unclear. These interactions may be mediated by inflammatory cells, hypoxia, or additional cell signals. It is not known whether ACTH synthesis occurs in bone. It is not known how ACTH action in bone varies with frequency or dose of ACTH administration. Aim 1 will study the mechanism of response of osteoblasts to ACTH and VEGF. To assure relevancy to human disease, study will include human cells in vitro. To determine whether ACTH provides survival signals in addition to VEGF, we will study the response of osteoblasts to VEGF, with and without ACTH. Cell proliferation and matrix synthesis will be measured, as well as production of regulatory cytokines by osteoblasts. To define the VEGF response, we will make osteoblasts with VEGF receptors -1 and -2 (ft-1 and fk-1) eliminated. This will allow ACTH effects on osteoblasts to be defined in the absence of autocrine VEGF response. Aim 2 will determine how ACTH modulates VEGF production in GC-treated bone. To determine how immune cells regulate production of VEGF by osteoblasts, we will make mixed cultures including macrophages or lymphocytes. In    addition, the Scarb1 mouse model, which has elevated ACTH at normal GC and dense bone, will be studied to determine changes to bone and vasculature in vivo. We will characterize VEGF production in culture, and determine whether VEGF regulation involves specifc cytokines, in tissue cultures and in mice. To establish the effect of hypoxia, we will compare VEGF production in 7% versus 20% oxygen in human cell cultures. Analysis will include production of key cytokines as a function of oxygen tension. To determine whether ACTH synthesis occurs in bone, we will analyze pro-opiomelanocorticoid (POMC) expression and processing in osteoblasts, lymphocytes and macrophages. Aim 3 will defne the dependency of VEGF synthesis in bone on ACTH concentration and dose interval using depot methylprednisolone acetate (MPA)-treated rabbits. Rabbits are the best in vivo model for CG-induced osteonecrosis; steroid diabetes will occur but will be controlled with insulin. Effects on VEGF production of varying IV ACTH injection, relative to depot MPA alone or no treatment, will establish concentration dependency. ACTH will be injected daily, at 8 AM, at 0.01 to 0.3 mg/kg, for 28 days. Osteonecrosis, bone turnover, serum ACTH and corticosteroids will be measured. This will establish the dose dependency of ACTH osteonecrosis suppression. To defne effect of frequency of administration on efficacy, we will compare the effects of ACTH 0.05 ?kg and 0.15 ?kg twice daily versus 0.1 or 0.3 ?kg once daily. This work will use innovative methods to defne a novel metabolic regulatory pathway in bone. It will establish new mechanisms that contribute to osteonecrosis, which may allow reduction of its occurrence."
"9487097","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         A tumor depends upon many cellular processes for growth and survival. Angiogenesis, for example, allows the tumor to create its own vascular supply and thus promotes growth, survival, and metastases. Cell proliferation, on the other hand, leads to sustained cell division and tumor growth. The molecular pathways leading to these processes are multiple, complex, and often redundant. Thus, therapies which have the potential to target different pathways would provide an effective strategy for treatment. RNA stability/translational efficiency is one level of gene regulation which interfaces with many of these pathways. Genes critical for malignant glioma (MG) progression, including growth, angiogenic and anti-apoptotic factors, are regulated at the RNA level by a common motif, the AU-rich element (ARE), present in the 3' untranslated region (UTR). Stressors such as hypoxia, inflammation and tumor therapy are often overcome by upregulation of these genes through RNA stabilization and enhanced translational efficiency. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), interleukin (IL)- 8, Bcl-2 and other inhibitors of apoptosis (cIAP1 and 2), all of which drive tumor progression in MG are extensively regulated at these levels. ARE-directed post-transcriptional regulation is tightly governed by RNA binding proteins (RBP) that bind to these cis elements. Certain RBPs such as tristetraprolin (TTP) and KH-type splicing regulatory protein (KSRP) bind to the ARE and negatively regulate the mRNA target by accelerating degradation and/or silencing translation. HuR, on the other hand, binds to the same elements but promotes mRNA stabilization and enhanced translation. Since our initial observation of HuR overexpression in MG, there have been multiple reports linking HuR to high grade malignancy and poor prognosis in all of the major solid tumors (e.g. breast, lung, prostate, and colon cancer). In the previous funding cycle, we have demonstrated that HuR is required for malignant glioma growth in vivo. This background provides the rationale for the current proposal which is to investigate the anti-cancer properties of a small molecule inhibitor of HuR (MS444) in malignant glioma. We have exciting in vivo preliminary data showing an anti-cancer effect and no significant toxicity. We also have data indicating that brain tumor initiating cells, normally resistant to standard therapy, are particularly sensitive to the inhibitor. We have found that HuR inhibition may target a critical survival pathway driven by NF-kB. Our hypothesis is that MS444 inhibits glioma growth by disrupting the posttranscriptional regulation of key tumor survival pathways provided by HuR. The specific aims will use authentic primary glioma xenolines and mouse models to further characterize this nascent class (i.e. post- transcriptional regulation) of anti-cancer targets. The common occurrence of ARE-governed RNA regulation of growth and anti-apoptotic factors across many tumors broadens the relevance of this proposal MG. Specific Aims:  1. To characterize the antitumor phenotype of the HuR inhibitor, MS-444, in malignant glioma.  2. To characterize the molecular impact of HuR inhibition on the NF-kB survival pathway in malignant  glioma as a mechanism for the anticancer effects of MS444.  3. To assess the specificity of MS444 and other HuR inhibitors for binding to HuR and blocking mRNA binding."
"9486881","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):          Head trauma is a risk factor for both Alzheimer disease (AD) and Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE), a progressive neurodegenerative disease that occurs as a consequence of repetitive mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI). CTE causes personality and behavioral changes, executive dysfunction, and memory loss and is characterized by the accumulation of phosphorylated tau protein in the brain. We have shown that CTE can develop following a single explosive blast injury. Thus, veterans are at particular risk for developing CTE as well as AD. Presently, CTE can only be diagnosed at autopsy and there are no known clinical biomarkers. We propose a translational approach to systematically address neurodegeneration in the largest neuropathologically-confirmed autopsy cohort of CTE and CTE with AD (CTE-AD) patients in the world on the protein, DNA, and RNA levels, with the goal of identifying biomarkers, genetic risk factors, and mechanisms that can be targeted for drug discovery. We hypothesize that head trauma leads to the pathologies of AD and CTE through independent mechanisms involving different tau haplotypes and isoforms. Because head trauma and the resulting early pathology of CTE can affect different regions of the brain, we will correlate histological, biochemical, and genetic measures with a tissue microarray demonstrating affected and non-affected regions in human brain. We will use plate-based ELISA to quantitate levels of A? (1-40, 1-42, oligomeric) and tau (total and phosphorylated). In addition, we will determine the apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotypes and tau haplotypes of our subjects and correlate with clinical and pathological measures. Our preliminary data demonstrate that the APOE ?4 allele and H1 tau haplotype are enriched in subjects with CTE and suggests that tau isoform expression differs between CTE and AD. Thus, genomic variation in APOE and MAPT may predict risk for developing trauma-induced neurodegenerations. Furthermore, we will recruit 105 subjects with AD and with and without a history of mTBI as well as controls to measure tau and A? biomarkers in the CSF. We expect that trauma will exacerbate the changes seen in AD, leading to greater tau and less A?. Our preliminary data shows that tau and A? levels in CSF can be used to discriminate subjects with CTE and A? plaques from subjects with AD or FTLD.  Overall, we propose a two-pronged approach of 1) uncovering the progression of AD pathologies in subjects with repetitive mTBI and the mechanisms involved in CTE and AD tauopathy and 2) discovering genetic risk factors and biomarkers based on these pathologies in living subjects. A basic understanding of the mechanisms underlying the neuropathology of mTBI will facilitate rational drug design; and the development of reliable biomarkers to detect the long-term effects of mTBI will enable the diagnosis and monitoring of CTE and CTE-AD during life and will be crucial for assessing the efficacy of potential therapies as they are developed."
"9487099","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Acute kidney injury (AKI) occurs in 5-7% of all hospital admissions and recent evidence has shown that even minor changes in renal function are associated with increased risk of death. In the ICU, AKI is associated with 50% mortality, a statistic which has not changed even with dialysis therapy. In fact the Acute Renal Failure Trial Network study, a combined VA and NIH sponsored dialysis dosing study, showed no change in mortality statistics when comparing dialysis dosing. Clearly new approaches are urgently needed to address this life-threatening disease. Given the fact that the VA population is aging, prone to diabetes and hypertension, AKI is a major health problem in this group. Upon completion of this VA Merit Review, investigators in the renal community will have new targets for small molecular drug discovery that should ameliorate the mortality associated with AKI."
"9487878","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Candida albicans is the predominant species of human fungal infections and a common colonizer of the oral cavity in healthy adults, yet pathogenic overgrowth can occur when host immunity is altered due to severe illness or immunosuppression. Recent studies from our group have established a critical role for the pro- inflammatory cytokine IL-1? in protection from oral infection in a model of mucosal candidiasis. The synthesis, processing and release of IL-1? is tightly regulated and require at least two distinct stimuli; first, an inflammatory stimulus mediatd by innate pattern recognition receptors such as TLR2 or dectin-1 causes accumulation of large intracellular stores of pro-IL-1?. A second signal is required for activation of a multi- protein complex, the inflammasome, leading to the activation of caspase-1 and cleavage of pro-IL-1? to the active mature form. We have previously shown that the NLRP3 inflammasome is crucial for protection against Candida infection. New data from our laboratory show that, in addition to the NLRP3 molecule, another inflammasome protein, NLRC4, is up-regulated in oral mucosal tissues following Candida infection. In the absence of NLRC4, mucosal infection is enhanced. We also showed that the role of NLRC4 in anti-fungal defense is tissue specific, playing a more important role in the mucosa than in inflammatory cells, where the NLRP3 inflammasome is activated. In this proposal, we aim to further interrogate the role of different inflammasomes in mucosal immune responses to fungal infection, investigating the impact of NLRP3 versus NLRC4 activation on other important innate epithelial immune responses, the recruitment inflammatory cells, and the development of downstream adaptive immunity to Candida. Additionally, we aim to determine the molecular mechanism including the role of different fungal cell wall components in inflammasome activation in response to Candida. Due to increasing resistance to antifungal drugs, the development of novel therapeutic strategies designed to prevent or enhance clearance of fungal infection is a priority. This project will advance that goal through detailed characterization of the role of the NLRP3 and NLRC4 inflammasomes in host defense to mucosal candidiasis."
"9487908","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)        The persistence of the latent reservoir in HIV-infected patients is a major barrier to the eradication of this disease. Although combination anti-retroviral therapy (cART) is highly effective at suppressing viral production from the latent reservoir, cART withdrawal leads to a rapid viral rebound driven by the reactivation of viral transcription from the latent pool. In this project, we will develop a multi-targeted therapy that we expect will significantly reduce and potentially eliminate the ability of HIV-1 to infect target cells in the absence of cART. This combination therapeutic will target different key aspects of HIV infection, each of which contributes to sustained viremia in the absence of cART. These components include viral particles, virus producing cells, the CCR5 co-receptor expressed on target cells, and the integrated provirus. To clear HIV and HIV-producing cells that emerge during viral rebound, we have engineered a panel of anti-HIV monoclonal antibodies. These antibodies bind to various epitopes on HIV- 1 and have been modified to express functionally enhanced Fc domains. These altered Fc domains promote Fc receptor functions on myeloid cells such as antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), phagocytosis, and complement recruitment. We have developed CRISPR/Cas constructs that target and cleave the CCR5 gene. CCR5 gene cleavage in the CD34+ hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) population will lead to the differentiation and proliferation of CCR5-negative immune progeny that are resistant to infection with R5-tropic HIV-1. Moreover, CCR5 gene cleavage in differentiated leukocytes will also result in HIV-1 resistance. We have developed CRISPR/Cas gene editing constructs to cleave the integrated proviral sequence, so that infected cells transduced with these genes are unable to transcribe intact viral genomes. To deliver these CRISPR/Cas transgenes, we have developed lentiviral (LV) vectors that we will pseudotype with different viral envelope proteins and anti-receptor antibodies to direct LV to specific target cells. CRISPR genes delivered by LV are stably integrated into the target cell genome so that the transduced cells and their progeny are permanently protected from HIV infection. Typically, each of these approaches would be proposed independently, and efficacy measured against the absence of treatment. However, a key innovation of this application is to combine these approaches into one therapeutic regimen. In the first 3 aims, we will develop and select the most efficacious reagents for each of these approaches using a combination of in vitro cellular assays and in vivo assessments in the HIV-infected humanized mouse (hu-mouse). In Aim 4, we will combine the therapeutics and test them in the HIV-infected hu-mouse model, and determine their ability to suppress and delay viral production following interruption of cART treatment. We expect that these studies will not only develop clinic-ready reagents that will have undergone rigorous testing and validation in a pre-clinical animal model, but we will also demonstrate that combination targeting, like combination anti-retroviral therapy, is more effective than a single therapeutic in reducing the viral burden in HIV patients and in developing an HIV-resistant immune system. This work brings together the combined expertise of Drs. Susan Eszterhas and George O'Toole in the design of CRISPR gene targeting constructs, Dr. Bryan Luikart in the development of LV vectors for primary cell targeting in vivo, Dr. Margaret Ackerman in the optimization of antibodies for therapeutic development, and Dr. Dorothy Wallace in mathematical modeling of human diseases."
"9378379","The prevalence of Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) in the Veteran population is estimated to be a third higher than in the general population and the Veterans Health Administration currently cares for over 200,000 Veterans with moderate to severe kidney disease. The leading cause of death in patients with CKD is cardiovascular disease. Vascular calcification is highly prevalent in chronic kidney disease (CKD) and is a major cause of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Work done during our previous VA Merit Awards in vitro and in vivo in our CKD animal model, have demonstrated that vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) can de-differentiate to a more synthetic, osteo-chondrocytic cell with upregulation of RUNX2. This renders cells that can calcify in a manner similar to bone. Calcifying VSMC release matrix vesicles, small exosomes filled with calcium, phosphorus, protein and micro RNA (miRNA). Our bioinformatic analyses of miRNA arrays comparing VSMC and matrix vesicles have identified altered expression of multiple miRNA that regulate genes involved in VSMC phenotypic change/calcification, intracellular calcium (iCa) homeostasis, and oxidative stress pathways. Consistent with these findings, in vivo in our animal model of slowly progressive CKD there is also progressive increases in oxidative stress and iCa in VSMC. We hypothesize that Increased intracellular calcium (iCa) and oxidative stress are additive in inducing arterial calcification in CKD. To test this hypothesis in Aim 1, we propose to determine the relationship between increased intracellular calcium (iCa) and oxidative stress in calcifying VSMC from CKD versus NL animals. We will alter the iCa and determine the effect on oxidative stress, and conversely, decrease oxidative stress and determine if this alters iCa and if calcium channels/transporters are oxidized leading to altered function. In Aim 2, we will determine if the combination of decreased iCa and decreased oxidative stress alters CKD VSMC matrix vesicle protein content, miRNA profile, and modulation of the recipient VSMC osteogenic phenotype. In Aim 3, we will determine if the administration of the combination of agents to reduce both iCa and oxidative stress can prevent and/or treat arterial calcification in vivo in our rat model of progressive CKD. These studies will determine if the vicious cycle of increased iCa and increased oxidative stress accelerate vascular calcification in CKD, the mechanisms by which this happens, the role of matrix vesicle miRNA, and if dual blockade can prevent and/or stop arterial calcification that plaques patients with CKD. Our long term goal is to improve the cardiovascular health of Veterans with CKD."
"9413976","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and Barrett's esophagus are the major risk factors for esophageal adenocarcinoma, a deadly cancer whose incidence has increased more than 7-fold over the past three decades. For reasons that remain unclear, metaplastic Barrett's cells are predisposed to cancer progression. Although the precise molecular events underlying this malignant transformation are not known, chronic GERD appears to underlie the process, perhaps because GERD causes inflammation with oxidative stress and oxidative DNA damage in Barrett's epithelial cells. The modern medical therapy of GERD is directed almost exclusively at decreasing gastric acid production with medications such as proton pump inhibitors (PPIs). Although the PPIs have been extremely effective for healing reflux esophagitis, these medications do not correct the underlying reflux diathesis, nor do they prevent bile reflux-induced oxidative DNA injury. This might explain why the frequency of esophageal adenocarci-noma continues to rise despite the widespread use of PPIs. Clearly, new medical treatments are needed to prevent bile reflux-induced oxidative stress and the malignant progression of Barrett's metaplasia.  Recent data suggest that esophageal adenocarcinomas develop as a consequence of GERD-induced oxidative genomic damage. Left unrepaired, oxidative DNA damage accumulates with subsequent cell cycles, leading to the genomic instability that is a strong predictor for cancer progression in Barrett's metaplasia. Maintenance of genomic integrity requires an appropriate cellular response to oxidative genomic injury, which is a key function of the p53 gene that is inactivated frequently during carcinogenesis in Barrett's esophagus. Oxidative stress and oxidative DNA damage activate Ataxia-Telangiectasia Mutated (ATM), a protein that transmits oxidative damage signals to p53 and p38 effector proteins. Data suggest that, in p53-deficient cells, ATM-induced activation of p38 is essential to cause G1 arrest, a process that prevents cells with damaged DNA from undergoing mitoses that would perpetuate oxidative DNA errors. Thus, agents that enhance this p38-dependent G1 checkpoint response might be used for chemoprevention in Barrett's esophagus.  In both p53-intact and p53-deficent Barrett's cells, our preliminary data demonstrate that weakly acidic bile salts induce oxidative DNA damage, cause G1 arrest, and rapidly increase levels of APE-1 and XRCC1 (base excision repair [BER] proteins that correct oxidative damage). Weakly acidic bile salts increase phospho- p38 expression, which appears to be especially important for maintaining genomic integrity in Barrett's metaplasia, as evidenced by our finding that p38 inhibition abolishes the G1 arrest induced by weakly acidic bile salts. In addition, our preliminary data show that ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA, a non-genotoxic, hydrophilic bile acid) hastens DNA repair in these cells. Those findings suggest a potential chemopreventive role for UDCA in patients with Barrett's esophagus. We hypothesize that, in metaplastic Barrett's epithelial cells, reflux-induced oxidative stress activates the p38 stress pathway to induce G1 arrest and enable repair of oxidative DNA damage, and that treatment with UDCA can enhance these response and repair processes. The aims of this study are: 1) To elucidate the mechanisms whereby oxidative stress caused by acid and bile salts activates p38 to regulate proteins that control the G1-S cell cycle checkpoint in Barrett's epithelial cells, and to determine if UDCA enhances these responses, 2) To elucidate the role of p38 in activating DNA BER proteins to repair acidic bile salt-induced oxidative DNA damage, and if UDCA enhances the efficiency of oxidative DNA damage repair in Barrett's epithelial cells, and 3) To determine the effects of bile acid-induced oxidative stres on phosphorylating p38 and other key proteins regulating the G1-S cell cycle checkpoint, and to determine if oral UDCA treatment enhances the expression of key BER proteins in biopsy specimens of Barrett's metaplasia already collected from patients who completed our previously funded CSR&D Merit Review study."
"9487112","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Tobacco use and prevalence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are significantly higher among veterans than non-veteran population. Airway and pulmonary vascular remodeling is the most critical process in the pathogenesis of COPD. Large amounts of reactive oxygen species (ROS) are released from activated inflammatory cells and other lung cells in COPD or from tobacco smoke (TS) per se. ROS are implicated in the development of airway and pulmonary vascular remodeling. However, little has been known about how ROS and TS lead to these pathological alterations. We have found that ROS and TS activates calpain in bronchial and pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (BSMCs and PASMCs) and that calpain mediates cell proliferation and collagen-I synthesis in PASMCs. Calpain is a family of calcium-dependent non- lysosomal neutral cysteine endopeptidases that act via limited proteolysis of substrate proteins in mammalian cells, including BSMCs and PASMCs. We have recently reported for the first time that global inhibition of calpain prevents pulmonary vascular remodeling induced by chronic hypoxia and monocrotaline. In preliminary experiments, we found that the specific calpain inhibitor, MDL28170, prevented ROS-induced increases in cell proliferation and protein levels of collagen-I in BSMCs and PASMCs. Transforming growth factor (TGF)/Smad pathway have been shown to play important roles in airway and pulmonary vascular remodeling. We have reported that calpain activates TGF1 by cleaving latent TGF1. This proposal is to study a novel hypothesis that calpain mediates ROS- and TS-induced cell proliferation and collagen synthesis in airway and pulmonary vascular smooth muscle cells via activation of intracellular TGF1 in TS-induced COPD. The protein and activity of calpain, cell proliferation and collagen synthesis will be determined in BSMCs and PASMCs with or without treatment of H2O2 and TS. Calpain activity will be manipulated using specific inhibitor, siRNA and over-expression of calpastatin genes. A novel intracrine TGF1 pathway will be studied in H2O2- and TS-treated cells. Moreover, the role of calpain in airway and pulmonary vascular remodeling will be evaluated in a COPD animal model using innovative inducible global and smooth muscle-specific calpain knockout mouse line. Finally, calpain will be pharmacologically targeted using a specific calpain inhibitor MDL28170 in a TS-induced COPD rat model. This proposal is novel because it will identify calpain as a mediator in airway and pulmonary vascular remodeling and calpain serves this role by activating intracellular TGF1 in BSMCs and PASMCs. A better understanding of the mechanistic insight will provide a strong rationale for manipulating calpain activities in the treatment of lung diseases such as COPD, pulmonary hypertension and cor pulmonale. Completion of this project will help find novel treatments for COPD and in turn improve the life and care of veterans."
"9487876","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):          Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is increasing in prevalence and affects more than 20 million individuals in the United States, and is especially common among veterans. Some causes are well known, such as diabetes and hypertension, and current management remains similar to two decades ago and consists of blood pressure control, blood sugar control, and blockade of the renin angiotensin system. More recently, we find that CKD is developing in people before they develop diabetes and hypertension, such as in subjects with metabolic syndrome, and also is developing in almost everyone as we age. Furthermore, once we have CKD, progression of kidney disease tends to continue despite our best efforts. It seems like there must be some other risk factor that has not been identified. In this proposal we present a novel hypothesis that our western diet may be driving subtle kidney disease in everyone. Specifically, we suggest that a little-known enzyme in the kidney proximal tubule, known as fructokinase, may be driving much of the current CKD epidemic. Fructokinase is an enzyme that metabolizes fructose and in the process causes intracellular ATP depletion, oxidative stress, and an inflammatory response. Diets high in sugars containing fructose can cause acute and chronic kidney disease in rats, likely due to metabolism of fructose in the proximal tubule. Recently we found that fructose can also be generated from glucose in the proximal tubule when the enzyme aldose reductase is induced, and preliminary studies suggest this may have a role in diabetic and nondiabetic CKD and also in aging-associated CKD. We therefore hypothesize that low grade fructose metabolism by fructokinase in the proximal tubule is the missing link that explains why CKD is increasing, why CKD is associated with metabolic syndrome, why CKD is occurring with aging, and why kidney disease progresses in subjects with preexisting CKD. To test these hypotheses, we will do the following studies. Aim 1 will evaluate the role of fructokinase in the CKD associated with aging and metabolic syndrome, and will also determine if CKD is accelerated by simple sugars containing fructose, sucrose, or glucose compared to complex carbohydrates. Models will include normal mice and mice with metabolic syndrome (Pound mouse) that either express fructokinase or have fructokinase systemically absent. Aim 2 will determine if fructokinase has a role in the renal progression that occurs in established CKD and whether it is accelerated by simple sugars via this mechanism. Aim 3 will test the hypothesis that it is renal fructokinase that is driving aging-associated CKD and the progression of kidney disease in established CKD using mice in which fructokinase is selectively deleted from the kidney. If successful, these studies will identify a novel mechanism driving CKD that could be as important a factor as hypertension and diabetes themselves. Furthermore, our studies should be able to determine if altering the composition of simple sugars in the diet can influence progression. These discoveries could therefore lead to both dietary measures, as well as potentially new treatments to prevent CKD in veterans and others living in western cultures."
"9487871","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Combat-related PTSD remains a significant and growing problem in the OIF/OEF veteran population. Understanding biological mechanisms that underlie risk for PTSD and modulate treatment responses will aid in (1) identification of novel treatment strategies and (2) enable individualized treatment approaches for PTSD. A polymorphism in the coding region of the catechol-o-methyltransferase (COMT) gene, COMTval158met, has recently been linked to risk for PTSD across 3 separate studies. Carriers homozygous for the methionine (Met) allele are more prevalent in PTSD patient populations, with the Met allele increasing risk of responding to moderate trauma exposure. Healthy Met/Met carriers exhibit abnormalities in fear extinction and Met/Met carriers with panic disorder exhibit reduced responses to exposure therapy. Hence, disruptions in fear extinction processes may explain why Met carriers exhibit increased risk for PTSD. The mechanisms by which COMTval158met alters risk for PTSD and affects fear learning processes are not understood. The COMTval158met polymorphism is a coding mutation in which subjects homozygous for the Met allele have reduced enzymatic activity with consequently reduced catecholamine degradation in frontal cortex. Recent studies suggest that dopamine (DA) signaling in the frontal cortex is necessary for fear extinction learning as well as for resiliency to long-term effects of stress. This project will use a novel humanized mouse model in which the human COMT gene with either the valine or methione coding sequence is knocked-in to the mouse Comt gene locus. This mutant model allows for direct comparison of the human COMT val and met allele effects on neural functions and behavior. This unique model will be used to determine (1) the DA receptor mechanism and neural circuits underlying Met/Met abnormalities in cued fear learning and extinction and (2) the role of COMTval158met in other PTSD-like symptoms and response to treatment. To enhance translation to the clinic, we will also test whether the COMTval158met polymorphism modulates the response to extinction-based treatments in veterans with PTSD. The overall hypothesis is that the Met polymorphism confers risk for PTSD and alters treatment response to exposure therapy due to alterations in catecholamine signaling in cortex and amygdala regions. In aim 1 we use novel knockin mice for the human COMTval158met polymorphism and pharmacological tools to test the hypothesis that altered DA receptor D1, D2 and D4 signaling in the cortex and amygdala underlies the extinction deficits and increased fear retention in Met/Met mice. In aim 2 we will use the predator stress model of PTSD in COMTval158met mice to determine if the Met allele increases responsivity to enduring effects of trauma on anxiety-like behaviors. We will also determine if methylphenidate, which preferentially enhances cortical DA signaling and is clinically available, blocks the anxiety responses induced by predator stress in COMTval158met mice. In aim 3, we will determine if the COMTval158met genotype predicts treatment response in Veterans with PTSD undergoing either extinction-based or non-extinction based psychotherapy. The findings from this project will (1) advance our understanding of COMT and cortical DA system in the etiology and treatment of PTSD (2) support development of targeted treatments that normalize catecholamine signaling in the frontal cortex of Met carriers (3) determine the potential utility of methylphenidate as a novel treatment for PTSD and (4) determine if the COMTval158met genotype is predictive of treatment responses in Veterans with PTSD."
"9486848","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):          The overall goal of this proposal is to significantly expand on findings from our ongoing Merit award-supported work to further interrogate gastrointestinal tract colonization and disease establishment of the diarrheagenic pathogen Clostridium difficile. To enable this project, we have identified unique bacterial factors that mediate C. difficile interaction(s) with the host intestine. Three Specific Aims are proposed. First, we will expand on our studies defining C. difficile response to, and tolerance of, reactive oxygen species and redox stress. This response severely impacts GI tract colonization of the pathogen, and highly attenuated, potential vaccine strains were generated for these studies during the current award period. Second, we will continue studies to interrogate infectious mechanism(s) of the low-toxin/high-virulence C. difficile strains we recovered from our active disease surveillance of the Southern Arizona veteran and non-veteran population. The wealth of proteomic data we have garnered will be exploited for genetic studies to define virulence and colonization mechanisms of these strains. Third, and with the goal of translating our research into an immediately clinically-relevant context, we will validate and test our newly-engineered recombinant probiotic bacterium which is a targeted C. difficile colonization inhibitor. All studies in this proposal will use existing or t-be-collected specimens from the veteran population, and utilize both hamster and mouse models of acute C. difficile infection and colonization respectively. We will also incorporate state-of-the-at methodologies including next-generation omics and sequencing, and live-animal bioluminescence imaging to interrogate various aspects of C. difficile colonization and disease establishment."
"9378725","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):          A major cause of colon removal surgery in veterans with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a failure of medically-induced mucosal healing. Mucosal healing is a reliable clinical marker of recovery after IBD therapy as it is associated with durable clinical remission. Despite the importance of mucosal repair, we continue to have a poor understanding of many of the cellular and molecular elements that mediate ulcer healing. The current proposal focuses on the role of colonic (epithelial) stem cells (CSC) in ulcer healing during colitis. Wnt/?-catenin signaling in stem cells promotes cell proliferation as well as self-renewal, both essential functions needed for ulcer healing and restitution of the mucosal barrier. A central tenant of this proposal is the hypothesis that Wnt/?-catenin signaling plays an integral role in mucosal repair in IBD and that steroids delay ulcer healing my impairing Wnt/?-catenin signaling. In mucosal ulceration, as seen in IBD, there is replacement of surface mucosa with granulation tissue that is re-epithelialized with new crypt structures. We suspect that active Wnt signaling is required for several steps through this sequence of events from stage 1) generation of an intestinal epithelial cell (IEC) monolayer, to stage 2) formation of epithelial invaginations, to stage 3) formation of crypt islands on ulcer surfaces and finally stage 4) regeneration of mature crypts (Fig 3). Biochemical data from our lab indicate Wnt/?-catenin signaling is increased during ulcer healing in colitis in mice and IBD patients. In studies to interrogate the role of Wnt signaling in ulcer healing, we discovered that IEC expressing mRNA for the Wnt target gene Axin2 expand in ulcer margins, on ulcer surfaces, and within newly-formed crypt structures in the middle of ulcers. Studies using a novel Axin2 reporter mouse model indicate that Axin2+ IEC are pluripotent and capable of growing colonoid structures in vitro from a single cell. Together the preliminary data suggest that Axin2+ IEC represent a novel ISC population that forms new crypt structures during ulcer healing. In Aim 1, Axin2lacZ/+ and Axin2 CreERT2/+; R26RmTmG/+ mice will be used to study ulcer-associated Axin2+ IEC localization and gene expression profiles of this new stem cell population, as well as perform lineage tracing during ulcer healing in DSS colitis. In Aim 2 we will examine ulcer healing in mice treated with steroids. New studies will utilize Axin2-specific expression of stabilized ?-catenin to examine its role in ulcer healin during steroid therapy. Aim 3 studies will interrogate the role of Axin2+ IEC in human IBD and will analyze the mechanisms by which steroids impair ulcer healing. The goal of these studies will be to determine if untreated UC patients exhibit increased Axin2 expression, Wnt signaling and stem cell gene expression in areas of ulcer healing (Aim 3A) and determine whether steroid therapy reduces levels of Axin2 expression and stem cell activation in areas of delayed ulcer healing in a prospective trial of UC patients treated with steroids for a colitis flare (Aim 3B). Together the studies proposed will provide valuable insights into the molecular mechanisms that govern ulcer healing in colitis. The goal is to determine areas where therapeutic targets can be designed to safely accelerate ulcer healing and reverse the negative impact of steroids on mucosal repair in colitis."
"9486825","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):           Many VA patients are susceptible and succumb to infections with the opportunistic pathogen, Pseudomonas aeruginosa. This can occur as a complication of emphysema, chronic bronchitis, cancer and immunosuppressive drug therapy. Exposure to this ubiquitous bacterium can result in nosocomial infections, which are common via respiratory ventilators, catheters, lumbar punctures and general surgery. P. aeruginosa is highly tolerant or resistant to most antibiotics, making it difficult to control such infections, which leads to a high mortality rate. The goal of tis research is to improve our understanding of the biosynthesis of a protective capsule-like polysaccharide called alginate, which is produced as a virulence factor by P. aeruginosa. During chronic respiratory infections (e.g., COPD), adaptive mutations occur in vivo that lead to the over production of this exopolysaccharide, which confers resistance to phagocytic killing. Such clinical isolates demonstrate mucoid colony morphology. Improving our understanding of this pathogenic mechanism in P. aeruginosa will enhance the management of pulmonary disease caused by this bacterium. Most of the enzymes for the production of alginate are clustered in an operon of 12 genes. In this study, we will: (1) Determine the role of the second messenger cyclic di-GMP in the polymerization of alginate, (2) Characterize the role of the membrane fusion protein (MFP) domain in Alg44, and (3) Characterize the protein-protein interactions among the alginate secretion proteins. In addition, as part of a drug discovery plan, we will (4) screen smal compound libraries for those that antagonize the acetylation of alginate, which is required for resistance to phagocytosis. In collaboration with a structural biologist, we will determine the structures of all the alginate biosynthetic proteins, which will lead to the analysis of site-direced mutants to better understand the polymerization-secretion complex. The long-term goal of this research is to understand the functions of all of the components required for the biosynthesis of alginate, which is now recognized as a critical virulence factor during pulmonary infection. The information gained could be vital for the development of new therapeutic approaches in the treatment of P. aeruginosa infections. The results of these studies will also contribute to our overall understanding of bacterial capsule biosynthesis, which is a common mechanism of bacterial virulence for avoiding the host immune response."
"9599806","The long term goal of this project is to establish the safety and tolerability of a novel oral corrector-- glycerol phenylbutyrate or Ravicti®.--of the most common CFTR mutation F508del-CFTR. Glycerol phenylbutyrate is a triglyceride pro-drug of 4-phenylbutyrate (4PBA, Buphenyl®). We tested 4-PBA as a systemic corrector for F508del in CF in a series of Phase 1 and 2 clinical trials. We found a maximum tolerated oral dose of 20 gm daily divided t.i.d. and the maximum induction of cyclicAMP-mediated nasal epithelial chloride transport on 30 gm daily divided t.i.d. as a median of -10 mV on days 4 and 7 of treatment. Under those conditions there was no significant decrease in sweat chloride values or in amiloride-inhibited NPD. We interpreted these results to signify that corrector therapy alone is insufficient for F508del in the absence of a potentiator. Since these publications, Vertex Corporation has had success with the development of ivacaftor as a potentiator (chloride channel opener) of G551D CFTR and has studied the drug alone and in combination with their correctors lumacaftor and VX-661 for homozygous F508del CF. The combination of ivacaftor and lumacaftor is before the FDA for consideration of approval in Cf. It is not yet certain that future combinations of corrector and potentiator will be safe and effective. A new pro-drug of 4-phenylbutyrate, glycerol phenylbutyrate or Ravicti® (Hyperion) was approved in February 2013 by the US FDA. This new formulation is an oral, odorless, tasteless liquid providing three molecules of 4-PBA for every molecule of glycerolphenylbutyrate. Pancreatic enzymes are required to release the active drug and must be taken with the drug to release the 4-PBA. Statement of Hypothesis: Glycerol phenylbutyrate will partially restore F508del CFTR in the nasal epithelium of adult CF subjects homozygous for F508del. Goals of the Project: Objective 1: To establish safety and tolerability in adults with CF of glycerol phenylbutyrate. Objective 2: To determine the effectiveness of pancreatic enzymes on absorption of glycerol phenylbutyrate. Objective 3: To establish the maximum tolerable dose of study drug. Objective 4: To quantify nasal epithelial CFTR-mediated chloride transport at 4 and 7 days exposure to glycerol phenylbutyrate or placebo. Objective 5: To select a dose of glycerol phenylbutyrate for a clinical trial of the combination of glycerol phenylbutyrate and potentiator (ivacaftor) in adult CF subjects homozygous for F508del CFTR. The study will be conducted as randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose finding design at three sites that are members of the CFTDN and skilled in the conduct of CF trials and outcome measures including nasal potential difference testing."
"9412086","The title of this grant asks a question that most sleep researchers might think has been answered. Our paper and Mignot?s group?s paper, both appearing in September 2000, showed that human narcolepsy is linked to a loss of hypocretin/orexin (Hcrt) cells. We reported a 90% loss, with all narcoleptics having surviving cells, a finding that has been repeatedly replicated. We know that, whereas the animal models of narcolepsy are caused by genetic changes, the human disorder is not. HLA (human leukocyte antigen) linkage to narcolepsy suggests that it is an autoimmune disease. The HLA, DQB1*0602 genotype is present in 85-95% of human narcoleptics, but is also present in 20-30% of the general population. The incidence of narcolepsy is about 1 in 2,000. In most cases, identical twins living in the same household are discordant for narcolepsy. Various correlations, much weaker than the HLA relation, have been reported between human narcolepsy and T cell subtypes, antibodies to Tribbles, antibodies to the Hcrt receptor-2, strep infection and insect bites. But, despite many attempts, no one has convincingly shown that narcolepsy can be induced in animals by immune system manipulation. Recently, we and Scammell?s laboratory simultaneously reported a peculiar and massive increase in the number of detectable histamine (histidine decarboxylase) cells in human narcoleptics. This finding has important implications for the regulation of neurotransmitter expression and brain histamine function in general, and may provide an insight into other disorders where inflammation has been linked to pathology, such as Alzheimer?s and Parkinson?s. It also resonates with some earlier work we did showing greatly increased glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), indicative of inflammation, in the histamine cell region of human narcoleptics. Although the peripheral role of histamine in inflammation is well understood, hence the widespread use of antihistamines, it is also known that histamine is involved in CNS inflammation and toxicity. Histamine opens the blood brain barrier. Furthermore Hcrt cells have been shown in in vitro studies to be much more likely to die from insult than adjacent hypothalamic cells. This suggests that the apparent selectivity of Hcrt cell loss that we and others have reported may be a reflection of the sensitivity of these cells to inflammation, rather than evidence for specific immunological targeting. We propose that the greatly increased number of histamine cells in human narcoleptics may mediate the destruction of Hcrt cells that causes narcolepsy. The mouse genetic work focusing on Hcrt may have discouraged a more comprehensive investigation of whether other regions of the brain are damaged or altered in human narcolepsy. We propose to investigate this hypothesis by looking for other evidence of damage explainable by histamine attack in narcoleptics. We will compare the damage present in human narcolepsy to that present in 4 animal genetic models of narcolepsy. We will further test the alternate ?compensatory hypothesis? by determining if other arousal related neuronal groups are increased in human narcoleptics. We are uniquely suited to do this study because we are in possession of the world?s largest collection of human narcoleptic brains (and matched controls) and because of our experience in working with these tissues as evidenced by our published results characterizing human narcolepsy."
"9383035","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): MicroRNAs are short noncoding RNAs that function as powerful regulators of gene networks. Although they were classically thought to function only within the cell, strikingly stable populations of extracellular microRNAs (ex-miRNAs) have been discovered in a variety of body fluids. Because their profile in serum is altered in many cancers such as prostate cancer, ex-miRNAs hold promise as a tool for cancer detection and treatment prognosis. Additionally, many studies are revealing a possible biological utility for ex- miRNAs shuttled between cells in extracellular vesicles, called exosomes, as mediators of paracrine signaling. Despite growing interest in the function of secreted ex-miRNAs and their clinical application as biomarkers for cancer, we still lack understanding of the underlying mechanisms of ex-miRNA packaging and secretion. The overall goal of this proposal is to identify the steps of selection for miRNAs during packaging and secretion via exosomes and determine how oncogenic stimuli can affect these mechanisms. I hypothesize that selective miRNA secretion is controlled by selective multivesicular body release and mechanisms of intraluminal vesicle formation, both of which are modulated by oncogenic signaling. These studies will shed light on the biological implication of ex-miRNAs in paracrine signaling and further our understanding of how to utilize them as novel biomarkers for cancer. This research project is crafted to facilitate my development into a versatile scientist capable of becoming a leader in academia. To achieve this goal, my training plan will help me advance my skills in biochemistry, molecular biology, and bioinformatics. My instruction will also be supported by coursework in cancer biology, ethics, and statistics/data analysis. I will further my career development by improving my communication and writing skills directly from my sponsor and other mentors, as well as taking advantage of classes and seminars offered at UCSF. The resources and mentorship afforded to me in this setting will give me the best opportunity to achieve my goal of leading an independent laboratory in the future."
"9519682","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Obesity-associated type-2 diabetes and its comorbidities, atherosclerosis and stroke, are all too common diseases in the aging population of our Veterans. These illnesses are invariably linked to aberrant lipid homeostasis as manifested by excessive synthesis and high circulating levels of very low-density lipoproteins and triglycerides. The long-term objective of our studies is to gain molecular insights into the mechanisms of hepatic lipid homeostasis and dyslipidemia and their cardiovascular complications. As a transcription factor that regulates key genes involved de novo lipid synthesis in the liver, sterol regulatory element binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c) is a central player in these processes. Nascent pSREBP-1c resides in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and must be transported to the Golgi where it undergoes regulated intra- membrane proteolysis (RIP) to release its transcriptionally active nuclear domain, nSREBP-1c that activates its own promoter. This feed-forward regulation SREBP-1c in the liver by insulin is a key mechanism of selective insulin resistance and hyperlipidemia and their clinical consequences. Based on compelling published data and our ongoing studies we hypothesize that phosphorylation via insulin-induced kinase PI3K-Akt/PKB, and its downstream kinases mTOR and p70S6K, regulate the RIP-mediated maturation, and trans-activation potency and stability of nSREBP-1c in the nucleus. Additionally, via crosstalk with insulin signaling kinases, MAP kinases also impinge on the feed-forward regulation of SREBP-1c in chronically obese rodents and man. With a goal to experimentally test this hypothesis, we have site-specifically mutated seventeen, AKT/mTOR/S6K and MAPK specific putative phosphorylation sites, selected on the basis of published observations and our theoretical analyses. Based on a rigorous assessment of the phenotypes of WT and mutated SREBP-1c in a McArdle hepatoma cell line and primary rat hepatocytes, we have selected FOUR sites [mTOR (S57 and S140), p70S6K (S956) and MAP kinase (S39)] for detailed examination of their role in the feed-forward regulation of SREBP-1c. The short-term goals of our proposal are (i) to identify sequence motifs of SREBP-1c involved in insulin-enhanced, phosphorylation- dependent regulation of RIP and trans-activation ability of nSREBP-1c in vitro and in vivo and (ii) to decipher how phosphorylation alters the molecular interactions of SREBP-1c during its ER to Golgi transit and proteolysis by S1P and S2P proteases, and (iii) to elucidate how phosphorylation alters the stability and transcriptional function of nSREBP-1c in the nucleus, in vitro and in vivo. To accomplish these goals, we will express wild type, and gain- or loss-of-phosphorylation mutants of tagged pSREBP-1c and nSREBP-1c proteins in rat hepatocytes in culture, and in livers of normal and obese and hyper-insulinemic MC4R knockout, rats, using our unique custom-designed adenovirus and plasmid vectors. We will compare the rates of RIP-mediated maturation of WT and mutated nSREBP-1c proteins and their trans-activation potential in the presence and absence of insulin. We will determine if/how phosphorylation alters the molecular interactions between full-length SREBP-1c and other molecules that are involved in ER-to-Golgi transit and proteolysis. Additionally, we will elucidate how phosphorylation alters the trans-activation potential of nSREBP-1c to activate its own promoter and the promoters of downstream target genes that regulate hepatic lipid synthesis. Our Specific Aims are designed to shed mechanistic light on phosphorylation-dependent actions of SREBP-1c on lipid homeostasis in vitro and in vivo. A successful completion of these studies has the potential to unravel novel therapeutic targets to treat chronic obesity and its pathological consequences for the cardiovascular system."
"9378704","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):          Human squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs) arising from the skin and oral cavity can present in an indolent form, similar to hibernation, with no obvious tumor expansion or local/systemic invasion. SCC indolence, which restricts net tumor expansion and invasion at the primary site, is severely understudied. Very little is known about why indolent SCCs persist and when they evolve into an aggressive form. Without molecular and cellular markers of SCC indolence, they are either over-treated thus causing morbidity or under-treated thus resulting in increased death. To overcome the lack of matched indolent and evolved SCCs in humans for comparative studies, we created a mouse model system, in which tumors developed from the same primary tumor can enter into and break out of indolence. In this system, we targeted a KrasG12D mutant and Smad4 deletion, the two most frequent genetic alterations in human SCCs, into keratin K15+ stem cells. These mice rapidly develop SCCs. After transplanting these SCCs to the skin of immune compromised or immune competent mice, some grew similarly to parental tumors (non-indolent) while others became indolent. When indolent SCCs were out-of-indolence, they grew and metastasized rapidly. This unique model system provides matched indolent and out-of-indolence SCCs for longitudinal comparisons. Based on our preliminary data, we hypothesize: Breaking SCC indolence is not simply leaving proliferative dormancy or overcoming microenvironmental stress. Intrinsic tumor epithelial properties and microenvironmental influences that control self-renewal and motility of tumor cells are key contributors of breaking SCC indolence. Based on our preliminary data, Aim 1 will assess if the numbers and properties of a subset of tumor initiating cells (TICs) influence indolence. Aim 2 will assess if EMT-mediated TIC expansion and cell migration are sufficient to contribute to breaking indolence. Aim 3 will determine the net effect of tumor-associated macrophages and B lymphocytes on tumor indolence. In all three aims, cellular processes and molecules responsible for breaking SCC indolence in mice will be examined in human SCCs from our tumor bank to determine if these cellular and molecular markers correlate with non- or out-of-indolence behavior in human SCCs, thus predicting poor prognosis. Our unique model system, high throughput approaches and cross- species comparisons will significantly accelerate identification of markers associated with breaking SCC indolence. The proposed functional validation of candidate markers will simultaneously test therapeutic strategies to halt SCC evasion."

During the last funding cycle, the NPC published preliminary criteria for the neuropathological diagnosis of CTE (9), criteria that are in the process of being validated by a NINDS funded UO1 panel of expert neuropathologists from other ADRCs and academic centers and will eventually be incorporated into NIA-AA guidelines (27). One of the major outcomes from NPC research has been the recognition that some of the clinical symptoms of CTE can be very similar to AD, raising the possibility that some subjects clinically diagnosed with AD dementia may, in fact, have CTE. Our studies have also found beta amyloid (Aß) deposition in 52% of individuals diagnosed pathologically with CTE (17) and that the presence of Aß in CTE is significantly associated with increased clinical severity and tau and alpha-synuclein pathology. Ongoing research also indicates that changes of CTE are a common co-morbidity in ADC and other neurodegenerative disease brain banks (26). These advances suggest a dynamic synergism between CTE and AD pathobiology, and highlight the importance of studying the effects of repetitive brain trauma on the development of AD. The overarching goals of the NPC are to conduct and foster research on AD and to determine the relationship of AD and other neurodegenerative pathology to repetitive head impacts (RHI) and CTE. The specific aims of the NPC consist of fundamental Core functions, namely to perform state-of-the-art diagnostic neuropathology, optimally store and distribute CNS tissue and other biospecimens, and provide neuropathological data to the other cores of the BU ADC and to NACC. The specific aims also build upon the significant innovations of the NPC with regard to CTE and focus on determining the relationship of RHI to AD and CTE. Over the past cycle, there have been substantial increases in funding and personnel, including 2 new MD, PhD neuropathologists, as well as large increases in infrastructure and equipment. These expansions have stimulated major technical innovations in qualitative and quantitative neuropathology. Other advances of the NPC include developing biomarkers for AD, CTE and related disorders, expanding the collection of CNS tissue to include spinal cord, eyes, plasma, serum and CSF, and increased collection of control tissues. To accomplish these aims, the NPC will continue to work in close collaboration with the other BU ADC Cores, other ADCs and ADRCs."
"9505847","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         HIV/AIDS is a significant health risk to both male and female veterans, and is transmitted predominantly by heterosexual intercourse. A roadblock to the discovery of efficacious prevention modalities, including vaccines and microbicides, is the incomplete understanding of basic virus-host interactions that underlie the acquisition of mucosal HIV-1 infection in the female genital tract. Two recent NIH workshops on Mucosal Immunity and HIV Prevention highlighted under-explored fundamental questions that need to be addressed, including anatomical sites of early virus infection in the female reproductive tract (FRT), and the influence of endogenous sex hormones on the mucosal environment and susceptibility to HIV-1. We submit that the endometrial mucosa of the uterus constitutes a site of early HIV-1 infection. (i) The upper FRT (uFRT) is accessible to pathogens. The uterus is readily accessible to sperm, experimental microspheres, viral and bacterial pathogens, and possibly HIV-1 virions attached to sperm. (ii) The cervical mucus is an imperfect barrier and upward myometrium contractions likely promote delivery of semen content into the uFRT. (iii) The uFRT comprises an abundance of HIV-1 target cells beneath the epithelium lining. (iv) Cellular and innate immune functions in the uFRT are suppressed during the secretory phase of the menstrual cycle. (v) Previous studies on HIV-1 infection of UEC are. (vi) Innovative and transformative virologic strategies are available in our laboratory that will facilitate physiologically relevant studies using primary mucosal transmission models, including transmitted/founder (T/F) HIV-1 infectious molecular clones (IMC), and HIV- 1 reporter genomes that augment both sensitivity and specificity for dissecting early virus-host mucosal interactions. (vii) We present preliminary results that to our knowledge demonstrate for the first time UEC are susceptible to infection by T/F. Therefore, there exists essential virologic underpinnings and compelling rationale to further examine the uFRT as a potential site for the acquisition of mucosal HIV-1 infection and transmission. Our central hypothesis is that the uFRT mucosa is vulnerable to productive T/F HIV-1 infection. To test this hypothesis, we propose the following specific aims: (1) To determine the susceptibility of primary UEC to productive infection by T/F, chronic control and laboratory strains of HIV-1. Viruses expressing T/F envs from isogenic reporter proviral genomes will be studied, enabling sensitive and specific analyses of productive HIV-1 infection in a primary UEC model of virus infection. Importantly, chronic control viruses will be analyzed in parallel experiments to rigorously address the question of whether T/F viruses possess unique fitness properties for infecting potential target cells that exist in the uFRT mucosa. (2) To elucidate cis and trans infection pathways by which T/F HIV-1 spreads from primary UEC to endometrial CD4+ T lymphocytes. Mucosal CD4+ T cells isolated from endometrium will first be analyzed for their susceptibility to infection by T/F and control viruses to establish important underpinnings for subsequent experiments with UEC. The following experiments will elucidate susceptibilities of autologous CD4+ T cells to HIV-1 infection mediated by de novo produced virus from infected UEC or transcytosis of intact/infectious virus particles. The results will be analyzed to elucidate virus subtype- and strain-specific susceptibilities of UEC and CD4+ T lymphocytes to HIV-1 infection, and identify mechanisms/pathways of virus entry and correlations of these factors with menstrual cycle stage. Such findings promise to provide critical underpinnings for translational prevention research initiatives."
"9487891","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Tight junctions (TJs) undergo constant homeostatic maintenance. While it is clear that TJ protein internalization and vesicular recycling are essential for this process, the underlying mechanisms are not defined. Studies using non-physiological stimuli have defined the actin cytoskeleton as a critical contributor to TJ assembly and maintenance. Actomyosin contraction, which has been linked to physiologic and pathophysiologic TJ barrier loss, such as that triggered by tumor necrosis factor (TNFa), drives downstream caveolar endocytosis of the TJ protein occludin. Similar processes have been implicated in barrier loss caused by enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC) infection. While both forms of barrier loss are reversible, it is not clear if actomyosin relaxation or TJ protein recycling are involved in this process. Further, despite an established role for microtubules in apical protein recycling, few studies have examined the contributions of microtubules to TJ homeostasis and repair. Recently, a specific subset of microtubules, planar apical networks of microtubules, was found to interact with the TJ protein cingulin. This interaction is regulated by AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)-mediated phosphorylation of cingulin and is essential to epithelial morphogenesis. Our data show that microtubule disruption impedes TJ recovery in calcium switch assays. In addition, the EPEC virulence factor EspG, which disrupts microtubules, attenuates TJ barrier restoration. These findings indicate that microtubules play an unexpected and critical role in TJ homeostasis and repair. However, the mechanisms by which microtubules contribute to these processes have not been explored. The long-term goal of this proposal is to define the molecular and cellular processes involved in the restoration of TJ structure and function and use this knowledge to design therapies to promote epithelial repair. The objective of the proposed studies is to define the role of the actin cytoskeleton and microtubules in TJ recovery from pathophysiologic insults. The central hypothesis is that microfilaments and microtubules actively participate in reestablishing intestinal epithelial TJs after disruption by pathological insults such as inflammation and infection. This research is highly relevant to the VA population as diarrhea among military troops is quite prevalent rendering a substantial portion unfit for duty at any given time and is associated with chronic health sequelae including irritable bowel disease and inflammatory bowel disease. Definition of the events involved in TJ maintenance and restoration will guide the development of strategies to preserve intact TJs and aid in TJ recovery. The central hypothesis will be tested by 3 aims: 1. Define the role of the actin cytoskeleton in TJ recovery following molecularly targeted, inflammatory (TNF) and infectious (EPEC), stimuli; 2. Determine the contribution of microtubules to TJ restoration from inflammatory insults (TNF) and enteric infection (EPEC) in vitro; and 3. Resolve the role of microfilaments and microtubules in TJ recovery from pathophysiologic conditions (TNF and EPEC infection) in vivo."
"9412753","Vitamin D deficiency (VitD-) is commonly encountered in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) (and other autoimmune diseases). Some studies show VitD levels impact expression of RA, but the mechanism(s) have not been well explored and have received scant attention in rodent models of RA. Interestingly, like VitD levels, in studies looking at only plasma gelsolin (pGSN), it was observed that pGSN levels also inversely correlate with C-reactive protein (CRP) in patients with RA. Gelsolin (GSN) has been shown to be protective in the TNF? transgenic (tg) mouse model of RA. It is known that sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) (acting through G protein- coupled receptors on T cells, B cells, monocytes/macrophages, and dendritic cells) affect immune and inflammatory responses and has been found to be elevated in RA synovial fluid but not osteoarthritis synovial fluid. Furthermore, pGSN binds to S1P, thereby regulating its ability to engage S1P receptors. We found humans, in addition to converting vitamin D3 (VitD3) to 25(OH)D3, also generate a noncalcemic analog, 20(OH)D3, with a serum concentration 1/20th of that of 25(OH)D3. In the type II collagen-induced arthritis (CIA), we found surprisingly that 20(OH)D3 treatment elevates pGSN levels and increases S1P levels in splenocyte cultures from these 20(OH)D3-treated mice. We discovered that supplementing VitD in humans elevates pGSN in sera and that 25(OH)D levels in normals and in RA and OA correlate fairly well with pGSN. Also, we found both 20(OH)D3 and 1,25(OH)2D3 increased sphingosine kinase (Sphk)2 mRNA in mouse splenocytes and increased GSN mRNA in cultured mouse myoblasts and pGSN production by explant cultures of mouse skeletal muscle. Knocking down GSN or Sphk2 worsens arthritis in mouse models of RA. Both GSN and Sphk2 regulate S1P levels in plasma or lymphoid tissue, which is important in immune function, including lymphocyte trafficking, Th1/Th2/Th17 cytokine expression, and control of FoxP3 regulatory T cells (Tregs). No studies have evaluated levels of 25(OH)D, S1P, and pGSN in the same RA population. We find 25(OH)D serum levels correlate fairly well with pGSN levels in RA patients, although concordance is not 100%. We further hypothesize that RA patients who have both high 25(OH)D and pGSN will have less RA disease activity score, while those with low pGSN and low 25(OH)D will have higher RA disease activity scores. Our overarching hypothesis is that there are interactions amongst VitD, GSN, and CD4+ T cell Sphk2, CD4+ T cell S1P receptor subtypes, and/or S1P that may be important in the modulation of autoimmunity and inflammatory arthritis. Whether administering VitD to humans with VitD deficiency/insufficiency will raise pGSN levels and modulate S1P, is unknown, and is the topic of Specific Aim 3. The three highly translational Specific Aims of this proposal are the following: Specific Aim 1A: Assess the association of serum levels of 25(OH)D, pGSN, and S1P separately, in patients with RA with measures of RA disease activity. Specific Aim 1B: Assess whether a clinical prediction model or models containing serum 25(OH)D, pGSN, and/or S1P levels provide more reliable prediction of the selected markers or measurements of RA disease activity than any single predictor alone. Specific Aim 2: To test the hypothesis that VitD replacement therapy in humans with OA or RA with VitD- will elevate levels of pGSN, reduce levels of S1P in plasma, and change lymphocyte expression of Sphk2. Specific Aim 3: To test the hypothesis that high dose VitD replacement therapy in patients with OA or RA and VitD- will reduce Th1, Th9, and Th17 effector T cells, increase Th2 and CD4+Tregs in peripheral blood, and whether there is interaction with existing plasma levels of pGSN and S1P. We also found that serum 25(OH)D levels correlate with pGSN in patients with RA and (in a small pilot study) that VitD supplementation in humans [healthy volunteers (HV) and patients with RA] raised 25(OH)D levels from insufficiency to normal range and was also associated with increases in pGSN. This suggests that (in both mice and humans) pGSN is partially regulated by VitD."
"9486868","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):           Abstract: Clonal diseases of large granular lymphocytes (LGL) are characterized by lymphocytosis and autoimmune manifestations including rheumatoid arthritis, pulmonary hypertension, and bone marrow failure. Several related syndromes have similar pathology involving the bone marrow including aplastic anemia (AA), paroxysmal nocturnal hemaglobinuria (PNH), and a subset of patients with Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS). Clinical improvement occurs after immunosuppressive therapy (IST) suggesting that activated T-cell induce this syndrome. The broad long-term objectives of this proposal are to improve the diagnosis and treatment of patients with LGL leukemia and other diseases associated with hyperactive memory T-cells. In our earlier studies of survival regulation in this disease, our lab was the first to demonstrate constitutive activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) transcription factor (STAT3) DNA binding. STAT-family proteins, including STAT3, play a critical role in many biological processes. They have proven oncogenic potential in several forms of cancer including breast, prostate, pancreas, leukemia and lymphoma. Until recently, the mechanism causing STAT3 activation was unknown. Recurrent mutations in the STAT3 Src homology-2 (SH2) domain were identified through exome sequencing by two independent international groups in 2012. More than 80% of the STAT3 mutations result in amino acid substitutions at position Y640F or D661Y (called mutSTAT3 throughout the application). Although these two amino acids have no known function in STAT3 activation, they have the potential to alter major protein-protein interactions with activated cytokine receptors or to strengthen carboxy-terminal phosphotyrosine 705 (Y705)-mediated dimerization. There is a known linkage between STAT3 and memory T-cell differentiation. A dominant negative STAT3 mutation occurs in patients with Hyper IgE Syndrome (HIES, or Job Syndrome). In these patients, a reduction in central memory T-cell development suggests that STAT3 may be involved in the regulation of memory T-cell differentiation. Mice with targeted deletion of STAT3 in T-cells also have a loss of central memory T-cells and an accumulation of inactive terminal memory cells during viral infection. Overexpression of active STAT3 in T-cells will close an important knowledge gap in the precise role of STAT3 in memory T-cell differentiation. Since the Y640F and D661Y represent the first naturally-occurring mutations with potential for gain-of-function, we will be able to address important questions with human disease relevance. The hypothesis to be tested in this application is that the naturally-occurring STAT3 mutations (Y640F and D661Y) alter SH2 domain structural properties leading to constitutive activation. Expression of this activated form of STAT3 then contributes to aberrant survival and expansion of T-cells with an effector memory phenotype capable of injuring normal tissues. Our research design will include three specific aims (SA): 1) to prove that naturally-occurring STAT3 mutations (mutSTAT3) increase survival by altering the STAT3 activation threshold, 2) to prove that Y640F and D661Y alter SH2 peptide domain interactions and serve as a unique target for drug design and, 3) to confirm our hypothesis that mutSTAT3 induces T-cell activation in memory T-cells to induce survival and tissue damage. Due to the prevalence and health care costs associated with autoimmune cytopenias, and the overwhelming devastation and poor treatment options of autoimmune diseases in Veterans, we believe our project is broadly relevant to the Veteran population and is focused on a critical health problem of interest to VA R&D."
"9486871","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Scientific evidence indicates that schizophrenia is a genetically complex mental disorder. Researchers have characterized up to a million points on the genome to identify those regions related to the disorder. This approach has accounted for a small percentage of the occurrence of schizophrenia and sometimes the genetic predictors derived for schizophrenia also predict bipolar disorder. An alternative approach to clarify the genetic underpinnings of schizophrenia is to simplify the definition of the disorder so it more closely reflects the biological expression of genes that lead to the disorder. Gottesman proposed endophenotypes as useful tools in this regard. An endophenotype is a measurable characteristic unseen by the unaided eye that represents an aspect of the causal path between genes and disease. The potential value of endophenotypes for understanding the basis of schizophrenia has been widely acknowledged; however, their utility has not been fully actualized. Most investigations have failed to thoroughly examine potential endophenotypes in schizophrenia and to date promising indices have been distantly connected to known neural mechanisms of the brain. Thus, only weak links exist between current potential endophenotypes and testable pathophysiological substrates related to gene expression. This study will 1) test visual perceptual abnormalities in schizophrenia against endophenotype criteria, and 2) provide a quantitative model of visual perceptual abnormalities in schizophrenia that derives from experimental findings of neural mechanisms in visual cortex We hypothesize that genetic liability for schizophrenia is specifically associated with errant high- level contextual modulation of vision that can affect early perceptual functions, while schizophrenia itself is additionally associated with a disturbance in the use of low-level context to guide visual perception. Aim 1. Using data from a battery of psychophysical tasks we will a) clarify the nature of abnormal contextual modulation of low-level visual perception in schizophrenia, b) quantitatively model low-level contextual modulation abnormalities in the disorder, and c) test whether problems with low-level visual perception are specific to schizophrenia as compared to bipolar disorder. Aim 2. Using data from psychophysical tasks administered to probands and first-degree biological relatives we will a) determine whether abnormal contextual modulation of low-level visual perception marks genetic liability for schizophrenia, b) apply a quantitative model to test whether there are similar contextual modulation abnormalities in schizophrenia probands and their relatives, and c) determine whether errant contextual modulation of visual perception is specific to genetic liability for schizophrenia as compared to genetic liability for bipolar disorder. Aim3. Using cortical source signals derived from high-density electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings that are constrained by both structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data, we will a) determine the timing and frequency characteristics of neural responses related to abnormal contextual modulation of visual perception found in schizophrenia and in association with genetic liability for the disorder, and b) test whether deviant neural responses during visual perception in schizophrenia can be accounted for by a dysfunction in local divisive normalization."
"9487896","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):        Hyperglycemia is the major risk factor for development of diabetic retinopathy. Tight control of serum glucose levels is currently viewed as the primary means to slow progression to retinopathy, but the mechanisms by which glucose enters the retina and how they become perturbed in diabetes remains unclear. Therefore, understanding the mechanism of how hyperglycemia affects the outer retina (RPE and photoreceptors) and identifying methods to ameliorate glucose-induced outer retina dysfunction and early biomarkers of diabetic retinopathy is important. Recently, it has been shown that systemic reduction of the facilitative diffusion glucose transporter, GLUT1 will reduce glucose levels in the retina; however, these studies do not provide a mechanism or means to control glucose entry specifically to the retina via the blood retinal barrier (BRB). The first objective of this proposal is to determine if reductions in GLUT1 within the RPE leads to reduced retinal glucose accumulation within the RPE/outer retina, prevention of RPE dysfunction and early biomarkers of diabetic retinopathy in mouse models of diabetes. The second objective is to investigate mechanisms of GLUT1 modulation by insulin and to determine if abrogation of insulin signal transduction in the RPE can mitigate abnormal RPE function in mouse models of diabetes by regulation of GLUT1 expression and localization. We hypothesize that (1) hyperglycemia-induced increases in the expression and redistribution of GLUT1 in the RPE mediates diabetes-associated reductions in RPE/outer retina function and early signs of retinopathy, (2) that insulin also modulates glucose transport by GLUT1 in the RPE and (3) that blockade of insulin signaling in the RPE will exacerbate retinal pathophysiology found in a mouse model of diabetes. To test these hypotheses, a mouse model of type 1 diabetes will be employed to investigate GLUT1 expression and distribution within the apical and basolateral membranes of the RPE and determine if this is concomitant with an accumulation of intracellular glucose. To determine if reductions in GLUT1 expression prevents outer retina dysfunction, a haploinsufficient Glut1+/- mouse and mice in which the Glut1 gene is specifically inactivated only within the RPE will be utilized. To additionally assess how insulin affects GLUT1-mediated glucose entry and accumulation in the retina, conditional inactivation the insulin receptor (IR) will be employed to abrogate downstream signaling from this receptor. In vitro analysis of cultured RPE cells will also be used to determine if insulin treatment alters glucose transport through regulation of GLUT1 by affecting its association with a binding partner, GIPC and/or the E3 ubiquitin ligase, Nedd4-2. These experiments will determine the role that GLUT1 plays in outer retina dysfunction as a result of hyperglycemia, elucidate how insulin is involved in GLUT1 modulation, and identify a mechanism which can be targeted for therapeutic intervention."
"9603982","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):      Optic nerve degenerations as seen in glaucoma, ischemic and traumatic optic neuropathies, are a leading cause of blindness in the U.S. and worldwide, and are very common in the veteran popuation. They are characterized by loss of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), which are not replaced by endogenous mechanisms, and thus vision loss is generally irreversible. Cell transplantation therapies provide new hope to protect or even to replace degenerated RGCs and restore visual function. However, little is known about the basic molecular mechanisms governing the differentiation of RGCs in normal retinal development, or from other stem cell sources. Here we propose to elucidate how RGCs are specified from retinal progenitor cells (RPCs) during normal retinal development, and apply that knowledge to the study of human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs). We recently uncovered a new pathway regulating RGC differentiation mediated through a class of SoxC transcription factors (TFs) that is necessary and sufficient to specify RGC fate. Furthermore, we discovered that growth and differentiation factor-15 (GDF15), a transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-? superfamily ligand, promotes RGC differentiation through up-regulation of Sox4 expression. In contrast, GDF11, another TGF-? superfamily member, inhibits RGC differentiation through down-regulation of another TF, Math5. However, it is not known how these two closely related TGF-?signaling ligands regulate RGC differentiation in opposing ways, nor whether this pathway through Sox4 can be manipulated to enhance approaches to cell therapies. We hypothesize that this novel pathway regulates RGC specification in vivo, and propose to determine, (1) how GDF11 and GDF15 temporal and spatial expression function in RGC differentiation during retinal development; (2) how the differential activation and function of SMAD signaling proteins downstream of GDF11 and GDF15; (3) how SUMOylation and TF cross-talk work in regulating RGC specification; and finally (4) how these pathways promote differentiation of RGC-like cells from hiPSCs, and promote these cells' integration into the retina after cell transplantation in vivo. Through these aims we hope to broaden our basic understanding of the molecular regulation of retinal and RGC development, and take steps towards the application of this understanding to generating cell replacement therapies for glaucoma and other optic neuropathies."
"9483825","Project Summary/Abstract: Depression (target disease of this proposal) affects 34 million Americans including 2 million seniors per year. It is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in older adults (target population of this proposal). The vascular depression hypothesis (proposed in 1998) remains the most salient theory explaining the onset and perpetuation of depression in older adults. This model is based on the observation that in older adults, white matter hyperintensities (a hallmark of small vessel disease, SVD) are associated with depression onset and perpetuation. Progress in understanding the relationship of small vessel disease with late-life depression has been stymied in part by lack of specificity of white matter hyperintensities which can represent components of edema, gliosis, ischemia, and inflammation. Traditional MR imaging is unable to distinguish between these components, and thus the specific mechanisms that contribute to depression remain unclear.  The emergence of ultrahigh field MR imaging allows for greater specificity of the WMH lesions, and other components of small vessel disease. Bringing 7 tesla (T) imaging into mainstream clinical use will be accomplished through 1) having exclusive (over 1.5/3T) application(s) and 2) achieving robust, safe, consistent, and homogenous high-quality images. Through a consortium consisting of experts at University of Pittsburgh combined with collaboration at FDA, University of Minnesota, and Quality Electrodynamics Inc., our goal is to enhance our understanding of the neuropathophysiology, treatment, and management of depression in older adults. We will achieve this goal through the development of robust radiofrequency methodology, as well as pulse sequences that produce 7T images with the aforementioned necessary attributes. This will be paired with complementary 3T MRI at baseline. We will use our recently developed (as well as a proposed) custom designed 7T radiofrequency coil system and pulse sequences that are already being used in disease/patient studies. Based on our preliminary results, the proposed RF solution will provide unprecedented homogeneity and consistency among different subjects/patients, and therefore excellent signal to noise ratio and contrast to noise ratio for detection of components of small vessel disease. The study will examine two cohorts 1) a group of 30 older adults recruited through the Alzheimer's Disease Research Center (ADRC) for developing an MRI to histopathology statistical model of SVD and 2) 60 older adults with late-life depression who will undergo scanning at baseline and after 2 years. The longitudinal 7T MRI and SVD model will be used to help characterize the small vessel changes associated with depression in older adults.  In summary, this study develops an emerging and timely technology (high-performance ultrahigh field MRI) to study a critical pathophysiological process (cerebral small vessel disease) in a clinically relevant population (Late-Life Depression). This project will further advance all of these three domains."
"9590365","SUMMARY  Differences in transcriptional regulation contribute tremendously to phenotypic diversity, including susceptibility to human disease. Transcription is regulated by the sequence-specific binding of transcription factors (TFs) to DNA, typically within promoter and enhancer regions, where TF binding often correlates with the expression of bidirectional transcripts. Work in our lab suggests that these transcripts represent a highly informative signature of TF activity, and that eRNAs may be directly regulated by TF binding. Aim 1 seeks to determine whether the binding of a single TF, p53, can cause eRNA transcription. We will initially focus on a single locus to determine whether p53 binding alone can initiate eRNA expression. The DRAM1 gene, as well as a p53-dependent eRNA about 20kb upstream, is rapidly induced upon treatment with the p53-activating drug, Nutlin-3. I will use CRISPR-Cas9 to disrupt the p53 binding site within the DRAM1 eRNA in order to prevent p53 from binding following p53 stimulation. We will use nuclear run on RT-qPCR to determine whether the loss of p53 binding results in the loss of DRAM1 eRNA and/or gene transcription. Next, we will attempt to rescue p53 binding at this locus by tethering the p53 transactivation domain to dCas9 and guiding the construct to the mutated p53 binding site and testing whether eRNA transcription is restored. This innovative approach will prove definitively whether the binding of a single TF can cause eRNA transcription, and whether eRNA transcription is correlated with increased gene expression. Missense mutations within TFs are common in cancer, but their functional impact is often difficult to predict. Several p53 missense mutations commonly observed in cancer alter p53s DNA binding specificity and target gene expression, and can lead to increased cellular proliferation and poor prognosis relative to complete loss of p53 function. Such mutations often occur within the p53 DNA binding domain, resulting in altered P53 transactivating capacity and modified physical interactions between p53 and other TFs. To determine whether p53 mutants display altered p53 binding and/or eRNA expression profiles, we will use CRISPR-Cas9 to generate cell lines expressing a single copy of mutant and wildtype forms of p53 in HCT116 p53-/- cells and perform p53 ChIP-seq and GRO-seq before, and one hour after p53 activation by nutlin. From these analyses, we will recover direct p53 wildtype- and mutant- specific gene and eRNA targets. Next, we will perform enhancer profiling to test whether other TFs are activated in the presence of p53 mutants. Finally, we will ask whether drugs designed to recover wildtype p53 function in mutant p53 strains are capable of restoring p53 wildtype eRNA and gene expression profiles.  "
"9378380","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):          Acute kidney injury (AKI) and chronic kidney disease (CKD) are critical health problems in the Veteran community. In the absence of sufficient tubule repair after injury and despite the best medical therapy, decreasing kidney function often leads to dialysis and significant morbidity and mortality. The growing gap between the increasing demand and limited supply of transplantable organs is now the chief limiting obstacle preventing extension of kidney transplantation to all patients and veterans with end-stage renal disease. Stem cell biology, and in particular induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) technology, provides new strategies via innovative advances in genomic and personalized medicine to decode the mechanisms of renal repair and pathways influencing tissue regeneration, to offer an opportunity for future clinical intervention to repair  injured renal tubules or replace failed renal tissue. We address the current limitation in stem cel technology-to delineate and target mechanisms of stem cell maturation in three-dimensional (3D) tissue. To define these fundamental parameters we developed and characterized acellular 3D scaffolds from decellularized rodent kidneys, which allow study of growth and differentiation of stem and progenitor cells toward metanephric mesenchyme, and ultimately a mature renal lineage. Evidence from our group, as well as others, indicate that signals from 3D extracellular matrix (ECM) scaffolds induce stem cell maturation. Our findings show stem cell differentiation in a geographically-specific manner with maturation and expression of E-cadherin centered around matrix-lined tubules. Our 3D scaffolds are bioactive, consisting of natural tissue- specific  ECM with structural proteins (e.g. collagens, laminins) and growth factors (e.g. VEGF, bFGF) known to mediate renal organogenesis. We will test the hypothesis that signals from 3D renal ECM tissue are a prerequisite to direct proper stem and renal progenitor cell differentiation to form nephron segments. The cellular complexity of the kidney prompts us to specifically focus on tubulogenesis within acellular matrix scaffolds and determine the requirements for regeneration and tissue formation in vitro. We will use two renal stem/progenitor populations: an early kidney-derived, adult renal progenitor cell capable of intercalating into developing nephrons, and a population of pluripotent reprogrammed human iPSCs and embryonic stem cells that differentiate to form early metanephric tissue. Our overall goal using 3D scaffolds and stem cells is to elucidate the elements of stem cell-matrix interactions that drive differentiation Aim 1 will investigate stem/progenitor cell response to modification of the renal ECM in a high-throughput system using small ECM scaffolds to rapidly screen conditions favoring differentiation. In this process we identify the requisite matrix-bound growth factors and test the  role of ECM remodeling by renal stroma fibroblasts. Aim 2 will assess scalability by analyzing the requirements for stem/progenitor growth in larger-scale organ-sized scaffolds and explore tubule formation within a perfusion bioreactor. This system serves as a model for nephron development within a full-scale kidney scaffold and establishes the requirements for stem cell differentiation and scaffold repopulation within normal and diseased ECM. This investigative strategy uses innovative matrix technology to modify tissue scaffolds with fibroblasts and bioactive ligands to delineate mechanisms of differentiation in 3D. Our systematic investigation is highly significant because it will decode the critical factors involved in nephron reconstitutio, which are critical next steps in tubule repair and renal tissue regeneration."

Focus will be placed on chemosensory and quorum sensing mechanisms and pathways, small molecule intracellular signals (e.g. c-di-GMP and c-di-AMP, ppGpp), two component systems and the cellular processes they regulate as well as mechanisms of bacterial lifestyle decisions including biofilms, bacterial multicellular behavior and predator-prey interactions. The roles of these systems with respect to pathogenesis will be central themes. A newly designed topic for this conference will be host-microbe interactions including the interplay between bacterial second messengers and the host immune system. All these critical areas will be addressed through cutting-edge applications of molecular genetics, cell biology, biochemistry, and chemical biology as well as structural, imaging, biophysical, and computational approaches. Data from high-resolution experiments will be paired with modeling to understand and predict the behavior of complex macromolecular assemblies and signaling circuitry. Invited speakers will include both established and early-stage investigators. In addition, poster presenters will compete for short talks. Participants will benefit from the Conference's open, collegial atmosphere that provides unique opportunities to engage in scientific discussion, promote scientific rigor, and foster interdisciplinary collaboration. For the third time, a Gordon Research Seminar (GRS) for postdocs and graduate students will precede the GRC. The GRS provides a supportive environment for young scientists to present their work and receive advice by leaders in the field. The STIM community has long supported junior scientists, and we view the success of the GRS as a necessity to continue on this mission. The GRS will help us not only nurture the development of early stage investigators, but also promote diversity within our community. The GRS will help junior scientists gain the confidence and skills to become full-fledged GRC participants. The well-integrated STIM GRC/GRS will direct established investigators to the most important questions confronting our field and will encourage young scientists to apply their recent training to the exciting new areas of microbiology."
"9487861","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):          It is being increasingly recognized that multiple pathways contribute to necrotic cell death in a highly regulated fashion and are amenable to specific interventions. Processes that have been implicated include necrotic cell death related to development of the mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT) regulated by cyclophilin D (CypD), necroptosis mediated by receptor-interacting protein kinases 1 and 3 (RIPK1 and RIPK3) and sensitive to inhibition by necrostatin-1, and pyroptosis resulting from activation of caspases 1 and 11. The ultimate downstream event required for several of the necrotic, immunogenic processes is glycine-sensitive opening of a plasma membrane channel. Preliminary studies for this proposal show that an additional pathway of iron-mediated cell death termed 'ferroptosis' may account for the iron-related cell injury involved in several common and clinically relevant forms of acute kidney injury (AKI). Ferroptosis is subject to modulation by novel small molecule inhibitors that emerged from chemical library screening, ferrostatins, as well as by other lipophilic antioxidants and by inhibition of NADPH oxidase. The objectives of this proposal are to further investigate and clarify the mechanisms of ferroptosis and its expression in freshly isolated kidney proximal tubules ex vivo, its impact on AKI in vivo, and its interactions with necroptosis and cyclophilin D pathways of regulated necrosis to address the hypothesis that regulated necrosis resulting from additive effects of ferroptosis, induction of the MPT mediated by CypD, and necroptosis contributes to tubule cell killing during AKI and is a target for pharmacological intervention. Studies will utilie tubules from rabbits and mice subjected to injury ex vivo and in vivo models of mouse AKI along with pharmacologic modulators and mutant mice deficient in CypD or RIPK3, newly developed mice deficient in both CypD+RIPK3 or caspase+RIPK3, and mice deficient in NADPH oxidase 4. Tubules isolated by collagenase digestion will be subjected to oxidant and iron-induced injury by tert-butylhydroperoxide or by hydroxyquinoline plus ferrous ammonium sulfate, or to hypoxia/reoxygenation. Lethal membrane damage will be quantitated as the final endpoint, and, at time points preceding that damage, measurements of ATP, mitochondrial membrane potential, reactive oxygen species production, and lipid peroxidation will be made to assess the mechanisms of this injury and its modification by ferrostatins, pharmacologic inhibitors of the MPT and necroptosis, and absence of pathway proteins. AKI will be produced in vivo by glycerol-induced rhabdomyolysis, clamp ischemia, or cisplatin followed by assessment of renal function and structural changes. These studies will further elucidate the role of newly characterized forms of regulated necrosis during AKI and provide insight into approaches for ameliorating them and the organ failure that results."
"9378396","    Project Summary/Abstract The vascular access is the ?Achilles Heel? of the hemodialysis procedure. Sixty percent of arteriovenous fistulas (AVF) that are created fail to mature successfully for dialysis use (AVF non-maturation), resulting in a very significant clinical morbidity and mortality for hemodialysis patients. On a radiologic level, AVF non- maturation is most commonly characterized by a juxta-anastomotic stenosis, and at a histological level it is characterized by a combination of aggressive neointimal hyperplasia at the juxta-anastomosis and an absence of outward vascular remodeling. At present, there remains a fundamental gap in our understanding of the mechanisms and pathways that lead to AVF non-maturation. Thus, there are few, if any, effective therapies to improve AVF non-maturation. The poor early outcomes following AVF creation and lack of therapies to treat this clinical problem represent an unmet clinical need. Our long-term goal is to better understand the pathobiology of AVF non-maturation in order to develop novel therapies. Preliminary work from our rodent AVF model has shown impaired endothelial-dependent vasorelaxation (EDR) locally at the AVF early after creation. Impairment in EDR represents reduced endothelial nitric oxide synthase (NOS3)-derived nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability. A decrease in NO bioavailability is associated with endothelial dysfunction. NOS3 and cGMP regulation play key roles in regulating nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability and vascular endothelial function. We have identified histone deacetylase-1 (HDAC-1), through its dysregulation of NOS3 function, and cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) as potential mediators of endothelial dysfunction following AVF creation. Thus, the objective of this proposal is to examine two important systems, HDAC1 and cGMP, that may play key roles in influencing endothelial function during AVF development. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that dysregulation of NOS3 and cGMP activity during AVF development (exacerbated in the setting of chronic kidney disease), results in loss of NO bioavailability, which impacts AVF remodeling and neointimal hyperplasia development. We will test our central hypothesis with two specific aims: (1) To evaluate mechanisms by which HDAC1 reduces NOS3 function and alters local endothelial function in the setting of AVF development and (2) To determine the effects of inhibiting cGMP degradation on restoring local endothelial function, and improving AVF remodeling and reducing neointimal hyperplasia development. We believe our proposed research is significant because it is expected to advance the understanding of the pathobiology of AVF non-maturation. Ultimately, such knowledge has the potential to improve therapies for AVF non-maturation. We expect that novel therapies to treat AVF non-maturation will positively impact Veteran ESRD patients' health by improving morbidity and mortality, through reduction in tunneled hemodialysis catheter use.     "
"9571707","Project Summary/Abstract Nitrogen and oxygen heterocycles are ubiquitous components of pharmaceutical drugs essential for human health. A particularly attractive approach to nitrogen containing compounds is the modification of cheap and readily available amines via C?H bond functionalization. However, methods that efficiently accomplish this task typically require the use of expensive transition metal catalysts and/or oxidants. This proposal is focused on the design and development of efficient and practical methods for amine functionalization. The main goal is the alpha-functionalization of amines through conceptually new and underdeveloped methods of substrate activation. One tactic will achieve amine C?H bond functionalization in redox-neutral fashion by combining a reductive amine N-alkylation with an oxidative alpha-functionalization, utilizing azomethine ylides as reactive intermediates. Water is generated as the only byproduct and the only required promoters are cheap carboxylic acids. A second strategy facilitates the functionalization of cyclic amines via a novel method involving intermolecular hydride transfer. This approach does not require protecting groups and provides valuable secondary amine products. Reactions are highly enantiospecific and enable late-stage functionalization of drug candidates. A third goal is the stereoselective synthesis of chiral oxygen heterocycles via oxocarbenium ions. These highly reactive intermediates have been notoriously difficult to control in enantioselective settings, in part because their direct formation from aldehydes and alcohols generally requires highly acidic conditions. A novel dual catalysis strategy enables the generation of oxocarbenium ions under unusually mild conditions, facilitating previously unknown enantioselective processes. In addition to targeting the rapid preparation of compounds related to structures with known biological activities, efforts will center on the development of particularly powerful reactions that rapidly produce new polycyclic amines and ethers. A priority is the generation of new structural frameworks that are absent from current drug discovery screening libraries."
"9529008","Cryptococcus neoformans causes cryptococcosis that claims hundreds of thousands of lives annually. The mortality rates of this fungal disease are unacceptably high (10-70%). Current antifungal treatments for cryptococcosis are extremely limited and no vaccine is available. Thus, there is a critical need to understand cryptococcal programs that could be selectively targeted by novel antifungals or vaccines. Cryptococcus can assume different morphotypes: the yeast form is considered pathogenic and the filamentous form is associated with attenuated virulence. Therefore, understanding the molecular bases for morphological changes and their impact on cryptococcal virulence could be exploited to combat this fatal disease. During the first phase of this research project, we established Znf2 as the regulator bridging morphotype and virulence potential in Cryptococcus. Deletion of ZNF2 locks cells in the yeast form and enhances cryptococcal virulence. Conversely, ZNF2 overexpression promotes hyphal growth. Cryptococcal cells overexpressing ZNF2 elicit protective defense responses in the mammalian host and are avirulent. More importantly, immunization with ZNF2 overexpression cells, either in live or heat-killed form, can offer 100% protection to the host against a subsequent challenge by an otherwise lethal wild-type H99 infection. Such protection is rarely observed against this deadly fungal pathogen. Therefore, activation of Znf2 represents a promising means to compromise cryptococcal pathogenicity and provides a vehicle to study host immunity. Given that Znf2 is the decision-maker for cryptococcal hyphal morphogenesis and its regulon is enriched with secretory proteins including adhesion proteins, we hypothesize that activation of ZNF2 alters cell surface composition and that certain cellular components present in ZNF2 overexpression cells are effective immunogens. Therefore, for the second phase of this research project, we will identify immunogens present in ZNF2 overexpression cells that can elicit protective host immune responses in aim 1. In aim 2, we will determine Znf2 regulatory circuits (activators, repressors, and/or receptors) and assess their roles in cryptococcal virulence. We hypothesize that turning on the activator and/or inhibiting the repressor of this potent anti-virulence factor could be exploited to compromise cryptococcal pathogenicity during infection. Our preliminary data suggest that Znf2 can be strongly activated artificially during infection, but its activation is subdued in wild-type cells. We expect that results obtained from the second phase of the research project will move us closer to our long term goals: to understand the fundamental requirements for morphogenesis and pathogenicity using Cryptococcus as a genetic model, and to harness such knowledge to develop preventative and therapeutic measures against invasive mycoses."
"9486830","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Helicobacter pylori is a Gram-negative bacterium that colonizes the human stomach. H. pylori infection is associated with an increased risk of cancer of the distal stomach and peptic ulcer disease. In previous studies, we have conducted detailed analyses of a secreted H. pylori toxin (VacA). The H. pylori genome contains three genes that are distantly related to vacA, and each encodes a protein >250 kDa in size. Similar to VacA, these VacA-like proteins are predicted to be secreted by a type V (autotransporter pathway). Bacterial proteins that are secreted by autotransporter pathways typically have important roles in the pathogenesis of infectious diseases. In contrast to VacA, which has been studied in great detail, thus far there has been very little study of H. pylori VacA-like proteins. Recent studies provide evidence that one of the VacA-like proteins (FaaA) localizes to flagella and has a role in H. pylori motility, and another VacA-like protein (ImaA) has anti-inflammatory activity. Hypotheses: The overarching hypotheses of this proposal are as follows: (i) the transcription of VacA-like proteins is tightly regulated in response to multiple stimuli, thereby allowing orchestrated expression of these in a manner that optimizes H. pylori colonization of the human stomach, and (ii) each of the VacA-like proteins has a specialized function designed to enhance H. pylori colonization of the stomach. Study Objectives: The long-term goals of this work are to understand the molecular mechanisms that allow H. pylori to colonize and persist in the human gastric mucosa, to understand the molecular mechanisms by which H. pylori infection leads to the development of gastric cancer or peptic ulcer disease, and to develop effective strategies for the prevention of gastric cancer and peptic ulcer disease. The specific objectives are (i) to define the mechanisms by which faaA and imaA are regulated; (ii) to define the roles of FaaA and ImaA in H. pylori colonization of the stomach and H. pylori-induced gastric disease; and (iii) to define mechanisms by which ImaA modulates H. pylori-induced inflammatory responses. Methods: To investigate the regulation of faaA and imaA expression, we will undertake in-depth studies of the promoter regions of these genes and identify regulatory systems that are responsible for the observed regulation of gene expression. We will investigate the roles of FaaA and ImaA in vivo through use of a system that allows expression of these proteins under control of an inducible promoter. Finally, we will use multiple approaches to investigate how the presence or absence of ImaA influences multiple phenotypes, including assembly of the cag type IV secretion system."
"9487872","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Prostate cancer (PCa) is the second leading cause of cancer deaths in US men. The TMPRSS2/ERG (T/E) fusion gene occurs in 50% of PCas and has multiple biological activities that can promote tumor progression. We have shown using gene knockdown targeting the T/E fusion gene can markedly decrease tumor growth in vivo. Thus the T/E fusion gene is an outstanding therapeutic target in PCa. The T/E mRNA fusion junctions are present only in PCa cells since these two genes are not transcribed into a single mRNA in normal cells. Specifically targeting these junctions using highly specific siRNAs should not have any specific off-target effects in normal tissues so toxicity should be minimal. We have recently developed non-toxic liposomal nanovectors. We have used these nanoliposomal vectors to deliver gene knockdown agents (siRNAs) targeting the fusion junctions in vivo and seen significant anti-tumor effects without toxicity. However, we need to further enhance delivery in order to maximize therapeutic efficacy since the ERG protein was not completely eliminated and tumors continue to grow, although at slower rates. We will try several approaches to increasing siRNA delivery. First, several chemical modifications of the nanoliposome will be used to both increase stability in the circulation and target tumor cells. Second, we will use drugs that are already in common use to enhance intratumoral nanoliposome delivery. Docetaxel chemotherapy is widely used to treat advanced PCa but is not curative. Radiation therapy is also a major therapy for PCa. Our preliminary data indicates that knockdown of the T/E fusion can enhance these therapies in vitro. We will determine if the optimized knockdown of the T/E fusion gene in vivo using non-toxic siRNA approaches can be used to enhance the efficacy of these therapies in PCa. A significant advantage of such targeted adjuvant therapy is that it will be tumor specific and thus minimize side effects in non-tumor tissues. The ultimate goal is to translate these approaches into clinical practice that will positively impact survival for men with PCa. As a monotherapy nanoliposomal SiRNA knockdown may be useful in men with advanced PCa. Every year tens of thousands of men receive docetaxel or radiation therapy for PCa and fail such therapies and thus there is a pressing clinical need to enhance these therapies. Significantly, the lack of toxicity of DOPC nanoliposomes has already been established in primates. Thus there is a clear path forward to translate our preclinical studies into clinical practice to benefit men with prostae cancer."
"9492491","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         This proposal builds on prior studies to define the mechanisms responsible for the direct antitumor effects of the attenuated mycobacterium bovis, Bacillus Calmette-Gu?rin (BCG). Intravesical BCG remains the standard of care treatment for patients with high risk, nonmuscle-invasive bladder cancer (urothelial carcinoma, UC). Unfortunately, BCG has significant limitations. Only 65% of the patients receiving treatment respond to this agent. Toxicity resulting from BCG's infectious potential limits its use to high-risk patients. With the goal of improving treatment efficacy, and/or decreasing treatment toxicity, the investigators have defined a robust set of intermediate endpoints for measuring BCG's direct effect on human UC cells. These endpoints include activation of intracellular signaling pathways, and transactivation of the genes for multiple chemokines, cytokines and white cell receptors. Signal activation/gene expression culminates in phenotypic changes characterized by cell-cycle arrest and apoptotic resistance. Subpopulations of cells undergo necrosis releasing the necrosis related chemokine HMGB1. As shown in the previous funding interval HMGB1 release is required for the in vivo antitumor response to BCG. The group's panel of endpoints provides insight into BCG's mechanism of action, and serves as a toolbox for assessing strategies to improve treatment outcomes.        The nature of the direct cellular response to BCG has led the researchers to hypothesize that cellular oxidative stress (COS), elicited by BCG binding/internalization, is a critical component of BCG's antitumor efficacy. Our published and preliminary data demonstrates that BCG serves as a free radical generator. Loss of BCG viability diminishes free radical production and the UC cell response to BCG across all intermediate endpoints. Downstream of the cellular binding/internalization of viable BCG, the researchers have demonstrated that transactivation of specific oxidative stress pathways and associated free radical production also are required for the optimal UC cell response to BCG. Pharmacologic enhancement of these pathways/free radicals potentiates the response of UC cells to viable and nonviable BCG.        This proposal will test the hypothesis that viable BCG's pharmacogenetic effects on UC cells, a requirement for antitumor activity, are a direct consequence of BCG generated H2O2 which serves as the trigger for COS and cell damage. Production of H2O2 by BCG, following binding to and internalization by UC cells, sets the stage for a second wave of cell-generated oxidants involving iNOS. Free radicals (superoxide and NO), and reactive molecules potentiate intracellular signaling pathways and downstream gene expression and result in a cellular phenotype that defines the BCG-treatment effect. Loss of BCG viability is associated with decreased H2O2 production, inefficient induction of COS and its direct consequences, and decreased treatment efficacy. Manipulation of contributors to the COS response to BCG represents an opportunity to enhance COS activity for greater antitumor effect. In combination with viable BCG such approaches afford an opportunity for greater treatment efficacy. When used with heat killed BCG these approaches promise to maintain treatment efficacy while decreasing the potential toxicity associated with viable BCG.        In addressing this hypothesis the proposed studies will meet two fundamental goals. First, the researchers will build upon existing data to complete their understanding of the factors contributing to BCG induced COS and COS associated cellular injury. By understanding the specific COS pathways activated in response to BCG, and the downstream effects of those pathways, the group will be poised to address their second goal. Specifically, to employ robust in vitro and in vivo systems to test strategies to potentiate BCG induced oxidant generation and oxidative damage in UC cells for improved treatment efficacy and/or decreased treatment toxicity. Selected treatment strategies will be translatable to the clinic in a way that will result in decreased tumor recurrence and progression rates and broader therapeutic applicability of BCG."
"9378382","Microglia are resident macrophages in brain and spinal cord that function at the frontline of innate immunity to respond and repair injuries and diseases. Despite the increasing attention to microglia, however, there are many critical barriers in our knowledge regarding the molecular mechanisms that activate microglia and the exact roles of microglial activation in neurodegenerative diseases. This new BLR&D Merit proposal focuses on the role of frontotemporal lobar dementia (FTLD) gene Progranulin (Grn [gene], PGRN [protein]) in microglial activation and neurodegeneration in mouse models of PGRN deficiency and in FTLD patients with Grn mutations. Progranulin is a haploinsufficient gene frequently mutated in FTLD patients. Using global and microglia-specific Progranulin knockout (Grn-/-) mice, we have recently shown that loss of PGRN promotes microglial activation and neuronal degeneration in toxin-induced injury conditions. In our current work, we show that PGRN deficiency leads to an age-dependent increase in microgliosis. In addition, large scale microarray analyses in control and Grn-/- aging cohorts show progressive up-regulation of lysosomal and innate immune response genes, including many key components in the classical complement activation pathway. Interestingly, the persistent neuroinflammation in PGRN mutants most prominently affects the ventral posterior medial (VPM) and ventral posterior lateral (VPL) nuclei of thalamus, which show features of neurodegeneration, including severe synaptic loss and progressive loss of neuronal cell body, Consistent with the critical role of these thalamic nuclei in connection with the barrel cortex and in habitual learning, aging Grn-/- mutants exhibit obssessive compulsive behavioral deficits (OCD). These results raise the hypothesis that PGRN deficiency leads to abnormal activation of microglia and facilitates neurodegeneration in a neural circuit critical for sensorimotor functions. Our overall objective is to elucidate the mechanisms by which PGRN deficiency lead to progressive microglial activation, pro-inflammatory gene expression, and contributions to neurodegeneration in a neural circuit that is critical for sensoimotor integration and highly relevant to human disease. We propose three specific aims to achieve this goal. In Aim 1, we will test the hypothesis that PGRN deficiency in microglia cell autonomously activates pro-inflammatory molecular signatures and functional characteristics. Aim 2 will generate inducible microglia-specific Grn (CX3CR1-CreER;Grnfl/fl) to test the hypothesis that PGRN deficient microglia cell autonomously promote circuit-specific neurodegeneration. In Aim 3, we will use pharmacological and genetic approaches to inhibit complement activation, and to test the hypothesis that aberrant complement activation contributes to the synaptic degeneration in the thalamocortical ciruits in Grn-/- mutants. Our results will provide clear mechanistic insights on the role of PGRN in microglia activation, complement-mediated neurodegeneration, and the role of microglial activation in the progression of neurodegeneration in Grn-/- mouse brains and in FTLD."

"9447302","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Neisseria gonorrhoeae (Gc) is an obligate human bacterial pathogen and the cause of gonorrhea. Gc is a major public health concern because numbers of cases remain high, it has gained resistance to multiple antibiotics, no vaccine exists, and infection is associated with debilitating, lifelong negative outcomes such as infertility and ectopic pregnancy. Mucosal colonization by Gc drives the recruitment of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs or neutrophils) to the site of infection and the production of a characteristic purulent exudate. Despite PMNs? robust phagocytic and antimicrobial activities, infectious Gc can be cultured from PMN-rich exudates, implying Gc possesses mechanisms to evade killing by PMNs. The failure of PMNs to clear Gc not only allows the infection to persist, but also sustains the PMN inflammatory response, causing the tissue damage that underlies infertility and other sequelae. To identify the mechanisms used by Gc to resist killing by PMNs, we developed an infection model using adherent, chemokine-treated primary human PMNs to approximate the physiological state of PMNs recruited to mucosal surfaces. We used this model to uncover two major ways in which Gc survives after exposure to PMNs. First, Gc expresses gene products that confer resistance to PMN antimicrobial compounds, such as proteases and antimicrobial peptides. Second, Gc varies expression of surface structures to modulate the route of phagocytosis by PMNs and consequent exposure to these compounds. Specifically, Gc that have phase-varied off expression of opacity-associated (Opa) proteins is internalized into immature phagosomes in which it survives and suppresses the PMN oxidative burst, while Gc expressing an Opa protein that interacts with carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecules (CEACAMs) 1 and 3 is phagocytosed into a mature, degradative phagolysosome and induces a potent oxidative burst. In this renewal proposal, we will continue to dissect the mechanisms that underlie Gc survival after PMN challenge. Aim 1 will define how Opa-negative Gc is phagocytosed into PMNs without eliciting the oxidative burst or phagolyososome formation and will evaluate the survival profile of Gc expressing an Opa protein that does not bind CEACAM3. We will evaluate the long-term consequences of these receptor- mediated interactions on the viability of both Gc and PMNs. Aim 2 will build upon results from a Tn-seq experiment conducted in the previous funding period to examine how bacterial efflux pumps and lipooligosaccharide variants contribute to Gc survival from PMNs. All experiments will be conducted with the adherent, interleukin-8 treated PMN infection model alongside analysis of freshly collected human gonorrheal exudates. Together, the results from this research will reveal the diverse approaches used by Gc to survive from PMNs, which ensures the continued persistence of gonorrhea in the human population even when facing a neutrophilic inflammatory response. This research can point to targets in Gc or PMNs that can be exploited for new therapies to treat drug-resistant gonorrhea while limiting the host damage associated with PMN influx."
"9487129","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common joint disorder and a leading cause of disability. Age and joint injury are among the primary risk factors for OA development. Since many Veterans are older and/or had traumatic joint injury when in service, they are at high risk to develop OA. However, there are yet no effective medical therapies to delay and/or limit OA development and progression, and this is an urgent medical need.  Progressive degeneration of articular cartilage is a major characteristic of the disease. Chondrocyte, the only cell type residing in the cartilage matrix, regulate the homeostatic balance between matrix synthesis and degradation, which fails in OA. Thus, one approach to rationally designed new OA therapies is to improve chondrocyte function by targeting pathogenesis of the disease.  AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a super-regulator of energy homeostasis and cellular metabolism. We recently discovered that AMPK activity is constitutively present in normal articular chondrocytes, but is decreased in OA chondrocytes, correlated with increased catabolic responses. In addition, loss of AMPK activity in chondrocytes is associated with inflammation, biomechanical injury and aging. Moreover, pharmacologic activation of AMPK not only attenuates pro-catabolic responses to inflammatory cytokines and biomechanical injury, but also promotes mitochondrial biogenesis and protects chondrocytes from oxidative stress. Furthermore, in our preliminary in vivo studies, we observed that berberine, a natural plant product used as traditional medicine and dietary supplement, and known to active AMPK, significantly limits mice from development of knee OA induced by surgical destabilization of medial meniscus (DMM). Building on these findings, we propose to test our central hypotheses that sustained AMPK activity is critical to articular cartilage homeostasis and that AMPK is a potential interventional target to delay and/or limit the onset and progression of OA.  We specifically aim to: (1) Define how AMPK activation is chondroprotective in vitro at the molecular level. (2) Determine if reduced AMPK activity in human knee articular cartilage, particularly in the superficial zone where cartilage degeneration appears to be initiated in OA, is a fundamental change in normal aging, providing a platform for OA development and progression. (3) Test the hypothesis that molecularly selective loss of AMPK activity promotes OA development and progression in mice in vivo (4) Test the translational hypothesis that therapeutic induction of AMPK activity by the highly selective AMPK activator A-769662 delays and/or limits the development and progression of spontaneous OA in vivo using the STR/ort mice (an established model for spontaneous OA that resembles human OA).  Completion of these studies will provide new insights into how changes in chondrocyte bio-energetics affects cartilage homeostasis, and aid to develop a new therapeutic approach by targeting at AMPK to suppress the development and progression of OA."
"9397413","Osteoporosis (porous bone disease) is a disease of the skeleton that can have debilitating effects on many US veterans. An estimated 44 million Americans, or 55 percent of the people 50 years of age and older, are currently at risk for osteoporotic fracture. Improved treatment options for the disease require a greater understanding of the cellular events and signaling pathways that control bone metabolism. The proposed research capitalizes on human diseases that result in very high bone mass. The genetic causes of these high bone mass diseases?craniotubular hyperostosis, sclerosteosis, van Buchem's disease?provide insight into how bone mass can be manipulated in osteoporotic patients to improve their skeletal health and prevent fractures. Many of the high-bone-mass associated diseases are caused by mutations in a cell signaling pathway called ?Wnt.? Thus, manipulation of the Wnt pathway holds great promise for skeletal health improvement. This pathway is particularly attractive as a therapeutic target because it can be manipulated to increase new bone formation, rather than simply prevent further bone loss (which is how all but one of the currently available FDA-approved therapies work). The long term goals of the proposed project are twofold: first, we seek to understand how the secreted inhibitors of Wnt signaling function as a coordinated unit (i.e., a milieu), by adjusting their expression levels when other members of the unit are adjusted (e.g., inhibited or deleted). Those adjustments in expression in the members of the milieu represent prime targeting opportunities to enact large changes in anabolic action in bone, as our supporting data suggest. We also seek to understand how this Wnt inhibitor milieu controls the anabolic action of mechanical loading?a potent anabolic stimulus that has lasting benefits to the skeleton. We seek to understand whether certain members of the inhibitory milieu function as ?homing signals? to ensure that new bone is added where it is needed most ? to the high strain regions of the bone, and that it is not added where it is not needed ? to the low strain regions of the bone. Again, our data suggest that the Wnt inhibitory milieu plays a significant role in this process. Our second goal of the application is to conduct functional studies targeting the Wnt inhibitor milieu, that have direct applicability to future therapeutic approaches in patients. Bone wasting conditions such as mechanical disuse (e.g., bedrest, paralysis) and glucocorticoid therapy (a drug used for treating inflammation and immuno- suppression) are common among veterans. Based on measurements we and others have made regarding the changes in expression of Wnt inhibitors following disuse and glucocorticoid exposure, we hypothesize that the ?compensatory milieu? of four Wnt inhibitors?Sost, Dkk1, sFrp4, and Wise?coordinate via unknown mechanisms to prevent anabolic action in the presence of disuse glucocorticoid therapy. We propose to target the entire milieu in different combinations, to determine whether we can restore anabolic activity in mice exposed to these bone wasting conditions. If so, those studies would have far-reaching implications for the design of therapies aimed at treating veterans with disuse- and glucocorticoid-induced bone deficiencies. Another functional study we will undertake, which also capitalizes on the biology of the Wnt inhibitor milieu, is to determine whether we can reduce the dose/volume of Sost antibody required to generate a significant anabolic response by additionally blocking accessory Wnt inhibitors that are part of the compensatory milieu. We have already shown that we can dramatically increase the anabolic efficacy of Dkk1 antibody if we use it in the presence of Sost inhibition. We anticipate a significant osteoanabolic effect using much lower doses of antibody if we simultaneously block other accessory Wnt inhibitors. In this renewal Merit application, we address these questions in order to identify new ways to improve bone health among the veteran population, and among the public in general."
"9445308","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):          Blood coagulation prevents hemorrhage and also contributes to thrombotic diseases including myocardial infarction, stroke, and venous thromboembolism. A great deal has been learned about blood coagulation on the scale of a test tube, an artery, and a vein. However, the regulation of blood coagulation at the single cell level has been largely unexplored. Under ordinary conditions endothelial cells that line all arteries and veins have anticoagulant properties. However, following injury or stress, endothelial cells develop some procoagulant properties and recruit platelets that respond with promounced procoagulant activity. Our preliminary data demonstrates that stressed or stimulated endothelial cells support assembly of the prothrombinase complex in focal areas on the cell while maintaining anticoagulant proteins on other parts of the cell. They identify TMEM16F as a protein required for normal platlet procoagulant activity. Localization of procoagulant activity is dependent upon regulated phosphatidylserine exposure and convex curvature of membrane regions. Thus our data suggest that stressed, viable endothelial cells can support procoagulant enzyme activity at the subcellular level, assisted by platelets, while maintaining anticoagulant properties. The objectives of this proposal are to characterize the role of TMEM16F with regard to procoagulant activity of platelets and endothelial cells using engineered mice lacking the protein. We will explore the functional consequences of the localized enzyme complexes on endothelial cells and determine whether TMEM16F- mediated phosphatidylserine exposure is also critical there. Finally, we will apply the insights gained to test a novel hypothesis in which focal fibrin deposition, mediated by endothelial cell stimulation, leads to trapping and elimination of many types of bacteria. The results of our studies are relevant to fundamental understanding of the blood coagulation mechanism and its participation in heart attacks and strokes. It is also related to the role of the blood coagulation mechanism in preventing or limiting bacterial infections. Finally, it may also help to explain the relationship of blood coagulation to inflammatory diseases."
"9487862","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Alcohol use disorders (AUD) occur commonly in Veterans and produce serious morbidity and mortality. Alcohol damages the nervous system across the lifespan, leading to crippling neurological disorders in adults and fetal alcohol spectrum disorders in children with gestational exposure to alcohol. Both stages of life are relevant to Veterans, since returning Veterans comprise a growing proportion of women of childbearing age with AUDs. This proposal extends ongoing work directed at identifying medications that will prevent or reverse the toxic effects of alcohol on the nervous system at all stages of life. Alcohol causes developmental toxicity in the brain partly by blocking cell adhesion mediated by the L1 neural cell adhesion molecule. Alcohol blocks diverse actions of L1 that follow L1 adhesion, including L1-mediated axon outgrowth (L1MAO) and L1 activation of Src Family Kinase (SFK) signaling. Alcohol also blocks signaling through SFK for two other important growth factors: netrin-1 and GDNF. Alcohol interacts with a binding pocket on the extracellular domain of L1 (L1-ECD) - the portion of the molecule that protrudes from the cell membrane and binds to L1 molecules on other cells. Phosphorylation of specific residues in the L1 cytoplasmic domain (L1-CD) does not block L1 adhesion, but abolishes ethanol inhibition of L1 adhesion, presumably by altering the conformation of the alcohol binding pocket in the L1-ECD. Importantly, certain small molecules and peptides also block alcohol inhibition of L1 adhesion, and these alcohol antagonists prevent alcohol-induced damage to the developing brain. The small peptide NAPVSIPQ (NAP) protects the nervous system against a wide array of insults, including prenatal alcohol exposure. NAP blocks the effects of alcohol on L1 adhesion, L1MAO, and L1 signaling at femtomolar concentrations (as low as one part per quadrillion). The mechanism by which NAP acts so potently is unknown. Here we will investigate how NAP blocks the effects of alcohol in cultures of cerebellar granule neurons (CGN) and slices of cerebellar cortex from postnatal, adolescent, and adult rats [and in an in vivo model of early postnatal alcohol exposure.] There are three objectives: 1. to determine whether NAP blocks ethanol inhibition of L1 adhesion by modulating phosphorylation of the cytoplasmic domain; 2. to learn whether NAP blocks ethanol inhibition of SFK activation by L1, netrin-1, and GDNF; 3. to determine whether NAP prevents or reverses alcohol cerebellar neurotoxicity across the lifespan. Cultures will be exposed to alcohol for varying periods of time in the absence and presence of alcohol, L1, netrin-1, and GDNF. We will systematically mutate phosphorylation sites in the L1-CD to simulate permanent phosphorylation or dephosphorylation of these sites. These constructs will then be treated with alcohol and NAP to identify specific mutations that render NAP incapable of blocking the effects of alcohol. We will then test whether NAP modulates the activity of kinases or phosphatases that act at the identified sites. Alcohol inhibits axon outgrowth in CGNs by blocking the activatio of SFK by diverse growth factors. We will determine whether NAP blocks the effects of alcohol on the activation of SFK by L1, netrin-1, and GDNF in mature CGNs and cerebellar slices from postnatal day 7 (P7) rats. We will then determine whether NAP antagonizes the effects of alcohol on neuronal survival, neuronal networks, and growth factor signaling in slices from early postnatal (P7), adolescent (P40), and adult (P80) cerebellum and [in cerebellum from rats and mice exposed to ethanol during the early postnatal period.] These studies will help characterize the mechanism of action of NAP, a potent alcohol antagonist, and will lay the groundwork for the development of treatments to prevent and reverse alcohol neurotoxicity in the brain."
"9397412","Macrophages can have profound effects on the progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD) by shaping the innate immune response. For example, pro-inflammatory M1 macrophages secrete tumor necrosis factor-? (TNF) and Interleukin-1 (IL-1), both of which can promulgate kidney injury and fibrosis. Through activation of type 1 angiotensin (AT1) receptors in the kidney, the renin angiotensin system (RAS) similarly plays a key role in progressive kidney damage culminating in renal fibrosis. However, in contrast to the pathogenic actions of renal AT1 receptors, our recent studies have shown that stimulation of AT1 receptors directly on macrophages suppresses their generation of M1 cytokines and thereby protects the kidney from progressive fibrosis. We further find that activating the AT1 receptor on macrophages enhances their expression of the transcription factor Krüppel like factor 4 (KLF4). In other disease models, KLF4 blunts the M1 polarization of macrophages, limiting their secretion of TNF, and we find that global TNF-deficiency ameliorates hypertensive CKD induced by RAS activation. We therefore hypothesize that AT1 receptor activation on macrophages attenuates RAS-dependent kidney damage and fibrosis by enhancing KLF4-mediated suppression of TNF. To test this, we will first determine the role of macrophage KLF4 in kidney disease, assessing renal damage and fibrosis in mice lacking KLF4 only in macrophages and wild-type controls subjected to the chronic angiotensin II infusion (HTN) and unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) models of kidney injury and fibrosis. We predict that KLF4-deficiency in macrophages will exacerbate RAS-dependent CKD by exaggerating their generation of TNF. Therefore, as a next step we will assess the contribution of the enhanced TNF production in macrophages to RAS-dependent CKD by subjecting mice with macrophage- specific TNF deletion (TNF MKO) to our HTN and UUO models of RAS activation. Lastly, our hypothesis predicts that during treatment with a global AT1 receptor blocker (ARB), TNF induction accruing from AT1 receptor blockade on macrophages will diminish the renal protection afforded by blockade of renal AT1 receptors. To test this, we will compare HTN- and UUO-induced renal injury in TNF MKO and wild-type mice treated with an ARB and will determine if mice with macrophage-specific deletion of both TNF and the AT1 receptor have less kidney injury than those lacking the macrophage AT1 receptor alone. In the near term, these studies should guide strategies to use cytokine receptor blockade in conjunction with ARBs during progressive CKD. Over the longer term, distinguishing the contribution of AT1 receptors in the kidney to promote CKD progression from the protective effects of AT1 receptors on macrophages to mitigate M1- dependent tissue damage should facilitate the design of improved treatments for CKD."

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Myocardial ischemia reperfusion injury, a consequence of organ preservation and implantation, adversely impacts both early and late outcomes after heart transplantation. As heart failure is highly prevalent among the veteran population, this area of investigation is of very high significance. While neutrophils are critical mediators of myocardial ischemia reperfusion injury, little is known about their trafficking and activation requirements during this form of sterile inflammation. Utilizing our newly developed technique of intravital imaging of beating mouse hearts, we have uncovered a role for innate immune molecules in donor hearts for entry of neutrophils into the graft tissue of freshly reperfused cardiac transplants. This application proposes to study mechanisms for neutrophil recruitment during myocardial ischemia reperfusion injury of heart grafts and will allow for the development of new therapeutic strategies."
"9493273","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):           Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by profound impairment in memory and other cognitive skills that make it difficult for patients to complete instrumental activities of daily lving (IADL) and live independently. Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) describes a condition in which an older adult shows poor memory, but is generally able to perform IADLs. Executive functioning (EF) refers to the ability to plan, reason, solve problems, and multi-task, and is dependent upon fronto-parietal networks. Functional imaging studies have documented increases in prefrontal cortex activity in MCI, and paradoxical increases in the connectivity between memory networks and fronto-parietal regions. We hypothesize that MCI is characterized by reorganization of frontally-mediated networks to compensate for AD pathology. Using EF as a means of defining fronto-parietal networks, the work proposed here investigates the structural and functional connectivity of prefrontal networks in MCI and AD. In aim 1, we will investigate if increases in brain activity in fronto-parietal networks reflect impaired structural connectivity within the network. In aim 2 we will explore how increases and decreases to the functional connectivity of frontally based networks predict IADLs in MCI and AD, respectively.  We will enroll 55 patients with MCI, 55 patients with AD, and 55 age matched elderly controls (EC). All participants will complete a comprehensive clinical assessment and undergo MRI scanning on a 3T magnet. Our first specific aim is to test the hypothesis that in MCI, declines to the structural connectivity of fronto- parietal networks will correlate with increases in brain activity in this network. This would support the theory that declines in network structural connectivity induce changes in functional activity to preserve cognition. Toward this aim, MCI and EC will complete cognitive fMRI tasks of EF and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). We will use DTI tractography to create the white matter tracts that connect the fronto-parietal networks involved in the tasks. We will extract mean fractional anisotropy values (FA) from these tracts to interrogate their integrity. We will correlate FA with fMRI brain activity to understand how changes to structural connectivity impact the network's functioning. Our second aim will test the hypothesis that there will be increased functional connectivity in frontally mediated networks in MCI, but reduced functional connectivity in AD. Moreover, in MCI, increased functional connectivity will correlate with poorer EF and IADLs. This finding would support the theory that in MCI, increases in functional connectivity reflect reorganization of frontal networks as a compensatory mechanism. In order to test these hypotheses, we will first identify frontal-parietal networks engaged during EF fMRI tasks in MCI and EC. Next, MCI, EC, and AD will complete resting state fMRI (rsfMRI). We will compare the functional connectivity of frontally based networks between groups and explore how functional connectivity is associated with clinical symptoms.  The results of both aims would support the theory that MCI is a dynamic state characterized by increases and decreases to the connectivity of neural networks. The seemingly paradoxical increases in brain activity and functional connectivity of frontal-based networks may be an attempt to compensate for accumulating AD pathology in memory networks. AD diagnosis and impaired IADLs may occur when the structural connectivity of fronto-parietal networks can no longer support compensatory functional activity (aim 1), and functional connections can no longer offset impairing symptoms (aim 2). This work will provide new insight into brain re-organization in MCI. It will support the integration of a nonlinear trajectory of brain changes int neuroimaging models of AD disease progression, lead to the development of disease resilience biomarkers, and begin to characterize new targets for treatment focused on supporting compensation."
"9486841","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Thoracic aortic aneurysms (TAAs) develop as a consequence to abnormal remodeling of the aortic extracellular matrix (ECM). TAA development is influenced by a series of interrelated mechanisms that disrupt ECM homeostasis through the stimulation of proteolytic pathways, such as the matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and dysregulation of the production and deposition of ECM proteins. Importantly, these mechanisms are mediated in part through changes in the resident cellular constituents within the aortic wall. Numerous studies have demonstrated that aortic dilatation is accompanied by the apoptotic loss of smooth muscle cells, suggesting that the aortic fibroblast may be the key cellular mediator of ECM remodeling during aneurysm formation. Moreover, recent evidence from this laboratory suggests that aortic fibroblasts undergo a stable transformation to a myofibroblast phenotype, that is characterized by increased myosin staining (DDR2/Myh11) and enhanced production of both MMPs and ECM proteins. It is hypothesized that the transdifferentiation of fibroblasts is essential for TAA progression. However, the mediator(s) regulating this fibroblast-to-myofibroblast transition during TAA development remain undefined. One upstream signaling protein capable of regulating the structure and composition of the aortic ECM, and known to play an important role in mediating the fibroblast-to- myofibroblast transformation, is transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-?). TGF-? is a soluble peptide growth factor, produced by multiple cell types within the aortic wall, and is known to play a significant role in aortic root dilatation secondary to Marfan syndrome, but its involvement remains undefined in non-MFS etiologies of TAA. TGF-? is sequestered within the ECM, bound by latent TGF-? binding proteins. These latent complexes are proteolytic targets for key MMPs (MT1-MMP) that are induced during TAA development. Accordingly, using an established mouse model of TAA, and isolated primary aortic fibroblast cultures (normal and TAA), the role of fibroblast transdifferentiation in TAA development will be examined with the central hypothesis that MT1-MMP- dependent TGF-? signaling is essential for TAA development through the modulation of aortic fibroblast phenotype change. This hypothesis will be tested by demonstrating that selective targeting of fibroblast transdifferentiation can modulate TAA formation and progression, that increased TGF-? signaling during TAA development is a direct result of altered MT1-MMP-dependent release of TGF-? from latent ECM bound stores, and that indirect pharmacological inhibition of TGF-? signaling results in the attenuation of TAA development. The outcomes from this unified set of aims will establish a cause-effect relationship between MT1-MMP activation, TGF-? dependent myofibroblast differentiation, and TAA development."
"9387440","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)        The candidate's long term goal is to become an independent investigator at an academic research institution to study the effects of hormones and endocrine disrupting compounds on the development and activity of brain circuits. He has received excellent training in neuroendocrinology, neuroplasticity, and behavioral neuroscience. He now plans to complement this knowledge and technical expertise with training in in vivo analysis of the role of endocrine disruptors on neuronal structural plasticity and brain circuit connectivity using targeted manipulation of gene expression via electroporation, time-lapse 2-photon imaging, neuronal reconstruction and structural analysis, electrophysiology and quantification of thyroid hormone levels.  During this training period the candidate will enroll in courses and seminars to improve his management abilities, communication skills and technical literacy.  By the end of this award, he will have gained the skills and training that will be needed for establishing his own lab. He wil also have the publication record and preliminary data on hand to write a R01 proposal with a high likelihood of funding.         Most of the training during the mentored phase will occur at The Scripps Research Institute (TSRI) under the supervision of Dr. Hollis Cline. Dr. Cline has taken a multidisciplinary approach to studying molecular and cellular mechanisms that govern the development of the visual system in Xenopus laevis tadpoles, including in vivo time-lapse 2 photon imaging, in vivo electrophysiological recordings of visual responses, calcium-imaging and behavior. Her laboratory has been at the forefront of developing exciting new techniques to study the factors that regulate circuit development. Her laboratory is located in the Dorris Neuroscience Center, which is an outstanding intellectual environment consisting of 14 faculty members and more than 100 postdocs and other scientists. Some of the candidate's proposed experiments will benefit from training from a co-mentor, Dr. Ardem Patapoutian, a TSRI faculty member with expertise in biophysics of the TRPA1 channels, which the candidate will use to manipulate neuronal activity.  In addition, the candidate will learn techniques to measure thyroid hormone levels in the laboratory of Dr. Robert Denver at the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor. Dr. Denver is a leading expert in endocrine disruption and physiology and will be an invaluable co-mentor to this project.         The goal of this research project is determine the effects of endocrine-disrupting compounds on brain development. Compounds that are used in the production of industrial and consumer products can accumulate in the environment and even be found in human blood and tissue in measurable quantities. There is increasing evidence that some of these compounds can affect hormone metabolism and action, including thyroid hormone, which plays an important role in brain development. Yet little is known about how environmental toxins that disrupt thyroid hormone function affect development of brain circuits.  The candidate will determine the effects of thyroid hormone disrupting compounds on CNS development, using the visual system in Xenopus laevis tadpoles, an ideal experimental system for these studies because the external development of the animal provides easy access to the developing brains for observation and manipulation.  The candidate will treat tadpoles with the active thyroid hormone triiodothyronine, methimazole (a thyroid hormone antagonist), and several thyroid hormone disrupting compounds. I will assess several parameters of brain development, including neural stem cell proliferation, differentiation and survival, and the development of neuronal structure and circuit connectivity. In addition, he will develop and characterize the use of microspheres as a local thyroid hormone delivery system and use this system to target particular hormone treatments to the retina or the optic tectum. These experiments will allow him to disambiguate the site of hormone action within the developing brain and to localize the sites of action and effects of thyroid hormone disrupting compounds on brain development. These will be important advances in the fields of environmental toxicology, neuroendocrinology and brain development. Furthermore, these experiments will establish the Xenopus retino-tectal system as an ideal model to screen thyroid hormone disrupting compounds for effects on brain development."
"9487907","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disease affecting up to a million people in the United States. Estimates of incidence of PD range from 18 to 182 per 100,000, making it the second-most neurodegenerative disease after Alzheimer's disease. It is increasingly becoming clear that exposure to different war zone chemicals increases the risk of having Parkinson's disease (PD). Accordingly, many of the Vietnamese Veterans who were exposed to a number of toxic chemicals collectively called Agent Orange and are currently getting old and are exhibiting signs of PD. However, in spite of extensive research, no effective therapy is available to halt the progression of PD or other neurodegenerative disorders. In spite of extensive research on the pathogenesis of PD, no effective therapy is available to halt this devastating neurodegenerative process. Glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) is a potent factor for survival and growth of dopaminergic neurons. Accordingly a decrease in GDNF production in the brain has been shown to play an important role in nigrostriatal degeneration in PD. Therefore, increasing the level of trophic factor GDNF in the nigrostriatum is considered as an important step in halting the neurodegeneration in PD. Although gene manipulation and stereotaxic injection of GDNF directly into the brain are available options, it seems from the therapeutic angle, the best option would be to stimulate/induce the production of GDNF in vivo in the CNS of patients with PD. Is it really possible? Our novel results show that it is possible with cinnamon, a commonly used natural spice and flavoring material used for centuries throughout the world, and its metabolite sodium benzoate (NaB), an FDA-approved drug for hyperammonemia and a widely-used food additive. We have found that oral feeding of ground cinnamon increases the level of GDNF and neurturin (NTN) in the CNS of normal mice and MPTP-intoxicated mice, an animal model of PD. Similarly, cinnamon metabolite NaB also upregulates the expression of GDNF and NTN in human and mouse astrocytes. Therefore, from the academic angle, we have dedicated Specific aim I to investigate molecular mechanisms behind novel trophic factor- upregulating activity of cinnamon. Because cinnamon increased the level of trophic factors GDNF and NTN, we have devoted Specific aim II to investigate if oral administration of cinnamon and NaB attenuates pathological events and improves locomotor activities in chronic MPTP mouse model and A53T a-syn transgenic mouse model of PD. We have discovered that cinnamon and NaB induce GDNF and NTN via PPARa. Therefore, Specific aim III has been enshrined to delineate if cinnamon and NaB requires the PPARa - GDNF/NTN pathway to protect dopaminergic neurons. Taken together, a positive outcome of this grant proposal will highlight undiscovered properties of NaB and cinnamon, and enhance the possibility of treating patients with PD or other neurodegenerative disorders with cinnamon, its metabolite NaB or agonists of PPARa as primary or adjunct therapy."
"9378719","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):          Lung cancer is a smoking-related disease and the No. 1 cancer killer in Veterans. The early detection of lung cancer by CT scan significantly reduces the mortality. CT scan is now recommended for lung cancer screening in smokers. However, CT scan dramatically increases the number of indeterminate pulmonary nodules (PNs) in asymptomatic Veterans, whereas only a small fraction of PNs are lung tumors. Given the large number of referrals to unnecessary and harmful procedures for smokers with indeterminate PNs, there is an urgent need for biomarkers that can rule out lung cancer in Veterans with PNs by specifically diagnosing the disease. We have previously developed sputum-based small non-coding RNA (ncRNA) biomarkers for diagnosis of lung cancer. However, the sensitivity and specificity of the sputum assay with only 2-3 biomarkers are not sufficient, and need to be improved by identifying and including new biomarkers. The objective of this application is to identify new lung cancer-associated small ncRNAs and develop them as sputum biomarkers that can sufficiently exclude lung cancer in Veterans with PNs. To achieve the objective, we will define a small ncRNA profile of bronchial epithelial cells of lung cancer patients, and then optimize a panel of sputum biomarkers for lung cancer using our existing sputum samples. We will also validate the performance of the new biomarker panel in newly and prospectively collected sputum specimens. The success of the project will produce a useful tool that can complement CT screening for lung cancer by ruling out lung cancer in a CT screening positive setting, and hence reduce lung cancer-related mortality in Veterans."
"9378727","[ Persistent memory impairment is one of the most common complaints after brain injury and is the hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD) as well as amnestic Mild Cognitive Impairment (aMCI; a transitional stage between healthy aging and AD). The prevalence of these conditions is increasing, as 40% of the VA population is elderly and age is the greatest risk factor for AD. Head injury also increases the risk of developing AD and the incidence of brain injury in Veterans (and the memory sequelae that accompanies it) has increased in recent years due to the Iraq and Afghanistan wars. Efforts to understand the functional and structural substrates of memory impairment have focused almost entirely on impaired new learning. Impaired remembering of the past (retrograde memory [RM] loss) has received little attention even though this impairment is particularly devastating (e.g., one forgets family relationships, important events, and facts about the world). Although impaired new learning is well studied, RM has received less attention even though Veterans with MCI and AD exhibit severe RM loss. Interestingly, individuals with MCI can exhibit relatively mild impairment in new learning in conjunction with relatively severe RM loss, suggesting that a new tool to detect RM loss could serve as an early estimate of cognitive and neural decline associated with the development of AD. Older Veterans exhibit changes in brain structure and function as the result of aging, and Veterans with aMCI exhibit even more significant changes in the brain. We will study RM in these two groups and identify brain regions (and connections between brain regions) where measures of structure and function are related to performance on RM tests. The two goals of the proposal are 1) to identify which brain regions support RM in cognitively normal older Veterans; and then 2) determine if a RM test could serve as a novel and unique gauge of the cognitive and neural changes associated RM loss in MCI. As time passes after learning, it is thought that the role of the hippocampus and related structures in supporting memory retrieval gradually decreases, whereas the role of the prefrontal cortex and other cortical areas gradually increase (memory consolidation). These observations are typically observed across years and decades in humans but, curiously, across days and weeks in animals. The proposed studies will identify the neuroanatomy of RM for both the short and longer time frames. In addition, we will identify the relevant neuroanatomy using four neuroimaging measures (i.e., 2 focusing on brain regions and 2 focusing on connections between brain regions). For the longer time frame, memory for facts will be tested during functional brain imaging (fMRI). The facts will concern 160 notable news events that occurred 1 to 30 years earlier. For the short time frame, memory will be tested during scanning for 320 fact- like, three-word sentences that were learned 1 hour to 1 month earlier. Measures of grey and white matter structure will also be obtained from anatomical magnetic resonance imaging and diffusion tensor imaging, respectively. To identify regions where structural changes correlate with the accuracy of RM, we will identify correlations between measures of brain structure (grey matter and white matter) and performance on the RM tests. Measures of brain function will be obtained from task-related fMRI activity and task-related fMRI functional connectivity. To identify regions where function correlates with RM, we will identify regions where brain activity and brain connectivity change with the age of memory. Next, we will ask which findings for structure and function are common to both time frames. Then, we will determine if the brain regions important for RM in cognitively normal older Veterans are dysfunctional or damaged in Veterans with aMCI. Finally, for developing a practical RM test, we will identify a subset of the questions that best predict genetic, neuropsychological, and neural risk for developing AD. We anticipate that a RM test can serve as a robust and sensitive clinical measure for staging preclinical AD or gauging the efficacy of treatments in Veterans with neurodegenerative disorders and reduce the burden on caregivers and VA Healthcare. ]"
"9487133","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Stroke is the fourth leading cause of mortality and a major cause of morbidity in the United States. Despite significant progress in the prevention and treatment of ischemic stroke, less is known about mechanisms and prevention of hemorrhagic stroke. We will use a hereditary stroke syndrome, Cerebral Cavernous Malformation (CCM), to study mechanisms underlying hemorrhagic stroke and cerebrovascular disease. CCM is characterized by chronic vascular leak leading to inflammation and by subsequent acute bleeding resulting in hemorrhagic stroke. This study will have direct and immediate application to the more than 100,000 veterans estimated to have CCM, and has significant potential to affect millions of veteran as our conclusions are applied more broadly to cerebrovascular disease. A significant subset of CCM cases is familial and represents a genetic cause for hemorrhagic stroke. Three separate genes have been identified in these families associated with CCM (KRIT1, OSM and PDCD10). These widely expressed genes are required in the endothelium for normal vascular development, endothelial cell cytoskeletal structure, and endothelial barrier function. In particular, the loss f KRIT1 and OSM results in very similar phenotypes in embryos, adult mice, and endothelial cell culture. Both KRIT1 and OSM have been found to bind each other as part of a complex of cytoplasmic proteins involved in scaffolding small GTPases involved in the cellular response to stress and controlling the cellular cytoskeleton and barrier function. A major endothelial signaling cascade involves nitric oxide (NO) produced by an endothelial isoform of nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) to induce smooth muscle relaxation, prevent platelet aggregation, limit smooth muscle proliferation, and inhibit leucocyte adhesion. The loss of KRIT1 in fibroblasts results in increased reactive oxygen species (ROS). However, whether increased ROS plays a role in the pathogenesis of CCM due to mutations in KRIT1, OSM, or PDCD10 has not been established. Importantly, some evidence suggests that the dysregulated signaling pathways associated with loss of function of each CCM gene may be different. Therefore, we hypothesize that increased ROS as a result of the loss of CCM proteins is a key contributor to vascular pathology in CCM, which can be rescued by scavenging excess superoxide, and serves as the downstream common pathogenic mechanism of CCM disease. This work will test an important functional hypothesis and clarify a promising potential therapeutic target in a hemorrhagic stroke syndrome and has the potential to provide a roadmap for bench-to-bedside translation to human clinical trials in the near future. Further, this work may serve as the foundation for future examinations of the use of superoxide scavengers in the treatment and prevention of other cerebrovascular disease. This proposal has both immediate translational potential for more than 100,000 veterans estimated to have CCM disease, and will underlie additional progress for diseases more broadly affecting the Veterans population."
"9397411","The liver plays a central role in whole-body lipid metabolism by regulating the uptake, synthesis, oxidation and export of fatty acids (FAs) and lipids. Dysfunction of lipid metabolism in liver underlies the development of obesity, diabetes, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and cardiovascular disease. Although the mechanisms that regulate the hepatic uptake, activation, and metabolism of fatty acids (FAs) are not fully understood, nearly all pathways of FA metabolism require conversion of FAs to acyl-CoAs by acyl-CoA synthetases. Long chain acyl-CoA synthetase (ACSL) is a family of five enzymes (ACSL1, 3, 4, 5 and 6) that catalyze the formation of fatty acyl-CoAs from ATP, CoA, and long chain fatty acids. Within ACSL family members, ACSL4 has unique substrate specificity for arachidonic acid (AA) and hepatic ACSL4 has been demonstrated being abnormally expressed in pathological conditions including hepatocarcinoma and NAFLD. However, to date, no literature reports have clearly defined the specific roles played by ACSL4 in liver lipid metabolism under normal and disease state such as the benign form of NAFLD (steatosis) and the nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). During the last funding period, we have obtained two major findings related to the regulation of hepatic ACSL4. First, we demonstrated that expression and activity of hepatic ACSL4 are upregulated by activators of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor ? (PPAR?) in vivo and in vitro. Through conducting lipidomic studies we further demonstrated that depletion of ACSL4 in hepatic cells selectively reduced cellular contents of several PC species including PC(18:0/18:1), a critical lipid mediator in PPAR? signaling pathway. Second, we uncovered a novel substrate-induced posttranslational regulatory mechanism by which AA specifically downregulates ACSL4 protein abundance in hepatic cells by promoting its ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. Since AA-derived eicosanoids have been implicated in the pathogenesis of NAFLD, the AA-induced ACSL4 degradation could be one contributing factor to the progression of hepatic steatosis to NASH with increased hepatic inflammation caused by imbalance between AA-CoA and unesterified AA that leads to increased production of AA-derived eicosanoids. Recently, through proteomic studies, we have identified the intracellular vesicular transport factor p115 as a major ACSL4 interacting protein and demonstrated that p115 interaction with ACSL4 is markedly enhanced by exposure of HepG2 cells to AA but not to other FAs. Since AA specifically induces ACSL4 degradation, our observations suggest that p115 might be a key mediator in the process of ACSL4 degradation through ubiquitin-proteasomal pathway (UPP). The overall goals of this revised Merit Review Renewal are to fully characterize two new regulatory mechanisms that uniquely impact the expression and function of ACSL4 in liver tissue to reach a better understanding of its specific roles in hepatic lipid metabolism under healthy and pathophysiological conditions including hyperlipidemia and NAFLD. The specific aims of this Merit Review renewal application are to: 1) comprehensively define the metabolic functions of hepatic ACSL4 and its critical roles in PPAR? regulated lipid metabolism under normal and hyperlipidemic conditions in two complementary animal models with acute deletion and chronic deletion of ACSL4 in liver tissues and 2) utilize various molecular and biochemical approaches to characterize the ubiquitination motifs of ACSL4 protein and to define the functional roles of the newly identified ACSL4-interacting proteins including p115 and other three ACSL4 binding proteins in the degradation process of ACSL4 via UPP in response to treatment with AA in vitro and in vivo. The successful completion of our proposed studies is likely to identify novel targets that can be exploited in the development of new therapies to treat hyperlipidemia and steatosis in metabolic diseases such as obesity, NAFLD and cardiovascular disease."

Alcohol abuse is a well-known problem in the veteran population, which includes a growing number of women of childbearing age. Some of the effects of ethanol in the developing brain have been attributed to a premature loss of neuronal plasticity. Astrocytes play a major role in mediating neuronal plasticity and in the formation of neuronal connectivity during development. We have recently shown that cholinergic stimulation of astrocytes in vitro increases the levels of extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins laminin and fibronectin, which trigger neuritogenesis in hippocampal neurons while ethanol decreases the levels of neuritogenic ECM in astrocytes and astrocyte-induced neuritogenesis. Neuritogenic ECM proteins can be modulated by changes in their rate of degradation. In preliminary studies we found that tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) and urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA), involved in the degradation of the ECM, are upregulated by ethanol. Our studies also suggest that the epigenetic mechanism of DNA methylation may be involved in this effect of ethanol, as ethanol inhibits DNA methyltrasferases (DNMTs) and tPA promoter DNA methylation in astrocytes, events associated with increased gene expression. We hypothesize that ethanol-induced inhibition of DNMT activity in astrocytes increases the expression of proteins involved in ECM degradation and inhibits hippocampal plasticity. Consistent with our findings, DNA methylation is delayed by ethanol during development. Ethanol- induced DNMT activity and DNA methylation changes in astrocytes and their consequences on neurons are unexplored. The most promising treatment for FASD is choline, which can be converted to phosphatidylcholine (PC), a major membrane phospholipid, and, in the liver and kidney only, to methionine and then to s- adenosylmethionine (SAM), the main methyl donor in the enzymatic reaction of DNA methylation catalyzed by DNMT enzymes. The neurochemical mechanisms by which choline supplementation ameliorates hippocampal functions affected by prenatal alcohol exposure remains elusive. Preliminary studies show that, in vitro, astrocyte treatment with both choline and SAM prevents ethanol-induced DNMT inhibition. The overarching hypothesis of this study is that ethanol inhibits DNMT activity, decreases tPA and uPA promoter DNA methylation, increases expression and release of uPA and tPA, decreases neuritogenic ECM, and inhibits neuritogenesis/dendritic arborization in the developing hippocampus. Choline and SAM, by restoring DNMT activity, prevent the effects of ethanol on DNMT activity, uPA and tPA expression, ECM levels, and neuritogenesis/dendritic arborization. Aim 1 will characterize of the effects of ethanol treatments , with or without choline and SAM, and of DNMT inhibition in astrocytes on DNMT activity and expression, uPA and tPA expression, release, activity, promoter DNA methylation, and PC levels in astrocytes and on neuritogenesis. Aim 2 will investigate the effect of in vivo ethanol exposure from postnatal day (PD) 4 to PD 9 and choline treatments on hippocampal DNMT activity and expression, tPA and uPA expression and promoter DNA methylation, fibronectin and laminin protein levels, and dendritic arborization and spine density. These endpoints will be measured on PD 9 and on PD 30. The expression of fibronectin, laminin-1, tPA, uPA, and DNMT isoforms in astrocytes and neurons will be verified by immunohistochemistry. This study may unveil novel glia-mediated effects of ethanol on neuronal development and provide mechanisms by which choline protects hippocampal neuron development from the effects of ethanol by modulating astrocytic functions. 1"
"9551166","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Anopheline mosquitoes transmit malaria, the world's most devastating parasitic disease, of which Anopheles gambiae is the principal vector for malaria in Sub-Saharan Africa. Different populations of mosquitoes vary widely in how readily they become infected with malaria parasites, while some strains do not transmit malaria at all. The mosquitoes' innate immune system is a significant factor that may influence the level of malaria infection; in particular the thioester-containing protein 1 (TEP1) targets malaria parasite for destruction during their initial invasion of the body cavity. The TEP1 gene varies significantl across mosquito populations with two major classes of alleles, TEP1*S and TEP1*R, that have been shown to directly influence the susceptibility to P. falciparum. In this project we will study the structure-function relationship between TEP1 alleles and their interaction with a mosquito-specific family of leucine-rich repeat proteins, the LRIM1/APL1 family. We will also study the diversity of structure and function associated with three closely-related LRR proteins APL1A, APL1B and APL1C, that influence the specificity of the TEP1 immune response. Finally, we will study the structure and function of three CLIP domain serine protease homologs (SPHs) that regulate downstream effects of TEP1 deposition, specifically melanization. The results of this project will shed light on the mechanism of mosquitoes' natural immunity to malaria infection and support the development of new vector-based transmission-blocking strategies."
"9505844","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         ABSTRACT: Osteoarthritic symptom is the key reason to seek medical assistance, yet there is no effective way to relieve osteoarthritis (OA)-induced pain. Our long term goal is to understand the discrepancy between the degree of cartilage degeneration and the actual experience of joint pain by investigating the neuroanatomical approaches in an experimental OA model followed by validation in human joint tissues. We propose that OA pain sensation can develop independently of progressive cartilage degeneration, and that severity of joint pain is due to cellular and molecular plasticity in the sensory neurons of the innervating dorsal root ganglion and pathological changes in synovium (e.g., synovitis, angiogenesis). We will identify the fundamental factors that facilitate pro- nociception in OA independently of the degree of cartilage degeneration. Our studies will also provide important empirical support for the development of clinical strategies to treat OA symptoms. Our results will provide a novel view of major disease-modified chronic pain mechanisms that accompany degeneration of knee joints in OA. At a broader level, results from this proposal will impact our conceptual perspectives and future research translation by clarifying relationships between musculoskeletal tissue degeneration and debilitating OA symptoms."
"9378737","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):          Glaucoma is a leading cause of irreversible blindness in the world, and it affects more than 285,000 U.S. veterans. Elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) is associated with both development and progression of primary open angle glaucoma, and IOP is the only modifiable risk factor for the disease. However, the mechanisms causing elevated IOP remain poorly understood. Trabecular meshwork cells are critical to maintaining a normal aqueous fluid flow and intraocular pressure. In other tissues such as the kidney, bones and cartilage, the primary cilia play a mechanosensory role in fluid flow. Here, we further explore the potential for cilia of trabecular meshwork cells to serve a mechanosensory role in the eye. Indeed, our previous findings demonstrate that phosphoinositide lipids within primary cilium are an important regulator of eye pressure. In the primary cilium, inositol phosphatase OCRL interacts with TRPV4, a mechanosensory channel that lowers IOP in mice when TRPV4 is stimulated. Previous studies have established that phosphoinositides regulate TRPV4 activity. We hypothesize that phosphoinositide signaling within the cilia of the trabecular meshwork cells regulates aqueous outflow via TRPV4 channels. In this application, we propose to employ novel optogenetic techniques to selectively direct protein translocation and activation of ciliary inositl kinase/phosphatase to modulate TRPV4 activity and IOP. In Aim 1, we will determine whether alterations in PIP2 dephosphorylation via OCRL affect ciliary outflow facility and IOP in mice by optogenetic stimulation of inositol phosphatase OCRL. We will then assess whether optical stimulation of ectopically expressed OCRL can rescue a steroid-induced glaucoma (SIG) mouse model. We expect that the activation of TRPV4 channels via light-responsive OCRL in the anterior chamber of mouse eye will lower IOP. In Aim 2, we will determine whether PIP2 phosphorylation via PI3K activation will affect ciliary outflow facility and IOP in wild-type mice.  We anticipate that optogenetic stimulation of PI3K signaling will increase IOP and reduce outflow facility. We will then determine whether small molecule inhibition of PI3K decreases IOP in the steroid-induced glaucoma mouse model. In Aim 3, we will determine whether steroid-induced glaucoma patients exhibit changes in their trabecular meshwork cell membrane phosphoinositide content. We will also compare phosphoinositide levels in cultured trabecular meshwork cells from patients undergoing trabeculectomy surgery to normal aged- matched cadaveric controls. The proposed research is expected to have a significant impact on the understanding of mechanosensation of eye pressure in mammals, thereby facilitating the discovery of new therapies for open angle glaucoma and other forms of glaucoma. Ultimately, the knowledge obtained from this study may allow for the development of new therapeutic strategies in glaucoma that will benefit our veterans."
"9455884","Abstract Spirochetes are the etiologic agents of many globally significant emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases, including syphilis, leptospirosis, Lyme disease, relapsing fever, and intestinal spirochetosis. In addition, they participate in polymicrobial infections and host-bacterial endosymbioses, and they are models for vector-borne, environmental, and zoonotic infections. Many are able to establish persistent, disseminated infection with the disease potential ranging from mild and non-specific to acute and life-threatening. The Gordon Research Conference on the Biology of Spirochetes (BoS GRC) and the accompanying Gordon Research Seminar (GRS, organized by and targeted to researchers in training) are held every two years and serve as the world?s only scientific meetings that bring together researchers who work on this structurally and taxonomically unique phylum of bacteria. The 2018 BoS GRC and GRS programs have been designed to highlight the diversity of research in spirochete biology and disease pathogenesis. Our first Aim is to promote presentation and discussion of diverse and cutting-edge research on spirochetes, including ecology, epidemiology, emergence, and evolution of the phylum, fundamental biology and virulence attributes of a variety of spirochetes, and the host responses that are both critical to clearance and to disease pathogenesis. Our second Aim is to promote career development for all scientists. To achieve these Aims, we have invited 36 speakers to the BoS GRC, many of whom are first-time attendees; three other invited speakers are trainees. We have reserved 6 slots for ?poster talks? that will be selected from the abstracts submitted by trainees for poster presentations. The GRS will include oral presentations, poster presentations, and panel discussions focused on career options and on harassment in science. Outcomes of the harassment discussion will be summarized in the GRC. The GRC will include a ?Power Hour?, an optional informal gathering for all meeting participants to address the challenges women face in science and to support the professional growth of women in science. Both the GRC and the GRS programs reflect the diversity of the research and the scientists in the field, with strong representation of women, underrepresented minorities, and international scientists as both speakers and discussion leaders. The bulk of the major advances in spirochete research during the past 20 years evolved from the discussions and collaborations fostered by the BoS GRC and, more recently, the GRS. The 2018 BoS GRC and GRS are deliberately designed to foster future collaborations based on shared and synergistic interests in, and thought-provoking discussions of, this diverse phylum."
"9378735","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):          BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Suicide prevention is a top VHA priority. Suicide prevention in every health system is hampered by difficulties with predicting the risk of suicidal behavior, due to low base rates leading to very low positive predictive values. Very recently, machine learning regression tree methods have succeeded in better identifying a group at particularly high risk of suicide post-discharge from military hospitals. This advance is greatly needed, since the first months to year post-discharge has been repeatedly shown to be one of the very highest-risk periods for suicide that is known. Nevertheless, suicide and suicidal behavior risk prediction post-discharge (and at any other time) is still extremely challenging. For instance, this study's Principal Investigator has found that, in the relatively recent past, a large majority (73%) of VHA  patients with depression denied suicidal ideation even when asked within 7 days of their suicide death. A clear need exists to develop measures of suicidal behavior risk that are not heavily dependent on patient self-report. Recently, our Co-Investigators conducted nonlinear dynamic analysis of movement data from non-Veteran inpatients and identified a signal that was correlated more strongly to suicidal ideation than any other characteristic tested. RESEARCH DESIGN: A prospective cohort study of 115-300 Veterans will be conducted to determine if the previously-identified specific actigraphy-based measurements highly associated with suicidal ideation in non- Veterans will predict suicidal ideation, suicidal behavior, and/or rehospitalizatin in Veterans. METHODS: An analysis of 115-300 Veterans admitted to the Bedford, Massachusetts VAMC acute psychiatry unit will be conducted. The primary analysis will focus upon 75-200 Veterans with current suicidal ideation or recent suicidal behavior (SI/SB) who do not have a primary psychotic disorder, Alzheimer's, or Parkinson's disease, and who are not undergoing alcohol detoxification. A separate analysis will be conducted of 40-100 patients undergoing alcohol detoxification, half with SI/SB and half without SI/SB. Participants will wear a  small, unobtrusive, wristwatch-like actigraph on their nondominant wrist, and complete self-rated and clinician- rated assessments of suicidal ideation, as well as self-rated assessments of the severity of other psychiatric symptoms. A Resiliency Index (RI) will be calculated using nonlinear dynamic analysis of the amplitude of movements over time frames from 6 minutes - 2 hours. These time frames are the periods for which a clear structure to the movement data is evident, with patients with suicidal ideation showing less variation in amplitude than patients without suicidal ideation. If medications given for alcohol detoxification are determined to not interfere with the RI, then a secondary analysis will examine the entire sample of 115-300 Veterans. One Aim will focus upon determining whether the original Resiliency Index or alternative movement data indices, such as one based on the change in the movement data over the hospitalization, predicts the presence and severity of suicidal ideation among Veteran inpatients. This aim will also examine the sensitivity and specificity of the RI for detecting the presence of any suicidal ideation, and of substantial suicidal ideation. (In non- Veterans, the RI showed a sensitivity of 72% and a specificity of 100% for detecting any suicidal ideation, and 86% and 88%, respectively, for detecting substantial ideation). The second Aim will determine whether the RI predicts subsequent suicidal behavior or rehospitalization over the next 1 month, 4 months, or 1 year after discharge, alone or combined with data about symptom severity, past history, and the present hospitalization. IMPACT: This study will contribute substantially to the VHA's high priority efforts to reduce suicide and suicidal behavior among Veterans. The approach studied here potentially likely particular value for suicidal behavior risk assessment in that it is not dependent on patient self-report of symptoms. This study is strongly supported by the VHA Suicide Prevention Program as a novel and potentially highly beneficial approach to suicidal behavior risk assessment, alone or combined with other readily available information."
"9171455","Research Education Component (REC) Program - Abstract A major research focus of the Boston University Alzheimer's Disease Center (BU ADC) is the intersection between brain aging, cognitive decline, and the long-term effects of Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI). Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE) is now widely recognized as a significant cause of progressive dementia in professional athletes who have sustained repeated mild TBI. The BU ADC is committed to training the next generation of leaders in clinical, basic, and translational research in neurodegenerative diseases including CTE. To this end, the Research Education Component (REC) will leverage the unique expertise of the BU ADC and affiliated faculty at BU to provide advanced training in clinical, basic, and translational research as it relates to CTE and to common themes of neurodegeneration including the basic mechanisms, as well as their clinical, cognitive, and behavioral sequelae. The scientific and research training of the REC will be focused on:  (1) CTE, including its pathology, pathophysiology, risk factors, genetics, biomarkers, clinical symptoms, and  behavioral manifestations, and (2) common themes related to neurodegeneration, including how pathology, pathophysiology, risk factors,  genetics, biomarkers, clinical symptoms, and behavioral manifestations of CTE compare and contrast to  other neurodegenerative diseases such as those that lead to frontotemporal dementia, primary progressive  aphasia, corticobasal syndrome, dementia with Lewy bodies, AD, and others. For example, research topics may include comparing and contrasting the role of tau in various neurodegenerative disorders, and its spread through the brain as one final common pathway. Other research topics may include comparing the pathophysiology and behavioral manifestations of the emotional dysregulation in CTE compared to that of the frontotemporal lobar degenerations. The REC will thus prepare the next generation of clinicians, researchers, and clinician-scientists to treat, understand, and develop new therapies not only for CTE but for the entire spectrum of neurodegenerative diseases in aging."
"9378393","Several different, seemingly unrelated processes can cause Parkinson?s disease (PD). For examples, genetic mutations that affect ?-synuclein expression, proteasome function, and mitochondrial quality control each produce a disease phenotype indistinguishable from toxin-induced and ?idiopathic? PD. A fundamental question is whether these disparate processes act through independent mechanisms to produce the same disease phenotype, or whether instead these processes converge to a shared pathogenic process. The question is important because identification of a shared pathogenic process could provide an approach for slowing the progression of idiopathic PD. Here we propose that neuronal glutathione is a critical nexus linking these processes, by virtue of its roles in both protein folding / repair and rapid scavenging of reactive oxygen species (ROS). We will test the hypothesis that ?-synuclein overexpression (or aggregation) causes neuronal glutathione depletion and resultant neurodegeneration by facilitating metal-catalyzed ROS production. The studies will use genetic and pharmacological approaches in mouse and cell culture models of PD. The Thy-1 ?-synuclein mouse, which exhibits several features of PD, will be crossed with mice having genetically reduced neuronal glutathione levels. The progeny and founder stains will be evaluated at serial time points with measures of motor function, neuronal glutathione content, oxidative stress, and ?-synuclein aggregation. We will also use these mice stains to evaluate a pharmacological approach for augmenting neuronal glutathione levels and slowing disease progression. The pharmacological studies will provide a complementary test of the underlying hypotheses, and will additionally provide preclinical efficacy data. Cerebrospinal fluid from the treated mice will be collected for a metabolomics assessment of potential treatment biomarkers. In parallel with these in vivo studies, we will use a cell culture system to more directly evaluate processes by which ?- synuclein overexpression or aggregation may promote ROS production and glutathione consumption. These processes include ?-synuclein interactions with dopamine, pre-formed ?-synuclein fibrils, and protein chaperones. Central to these studies is the concept that ?-synuclein or ?-synuclein aggregates can promote ROS production through association with transition metals. The studies will employ a dopaminergic SH-SY5 neuroblastoma line in which ?-synuclein expression can be titrated in response to a chemical signal (doxycycline)and, where feasible, cultured midbrain neurons from wild-type and ?- synuclein overexpressing mice."
"9487882","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         The goal of this project is to study the role and mechanisms by which host sphingolipids are involved in controlling the infection caused by the pathogenic fungus Cryptococcus neoformans (Cn).  A rapidly emerging area of research is the study of the role of sphingolipids in the regulation of infectious diseases (Reviewed in1). Although some sphingolipids have been linked to antibacterial activity of phagocytic cells,2,3 very little is known about the role of host sphingolipids against fungal infections. One of the host sphingolipid-metabolizing enzymes shown to regulate immune responses is sphingomyelin synthase (SMS), encoded by the SMS1 and SMS2 genes.4-6 SMS transfers a choline phosphate moiety from phosphatidylcholine (PC) to ceramide, therefore producing sphingomyelin (SM) and diacylglycerol (DAG).7-9 Very interestingly, the lipids regulated by SMS have been implicated in the activation of pro-inflammatory responses, suggesting that the regulation of SMS activity in immune cells may assume a critical role in controlling infections.  In our preliminary and published studies10,11 we found that: 1) inhibition of SMS activity profoundly impairs the ability of phagocytic cells to kil Cn cells by affecting extracellular killing in absence of phagocytosis; 2) SMS regulates production of DAG at the Golgi; 3) DAG produced at the Golgi by SMS regulates protein secretion via activation of protein kinase D (PKD); 4) inhibition of SMS or PKD blocks extracellular killing of Cn and peptide secretion (such as defensins) by neutrophils; and 5) neutropenia significantly exacerbates Cn infection. Based on these observations, we hypothesize that SMS activity plays a key role in controlling the extracellular killing of neutrophils through the regulation of a DAG-PKD-mediated secretion pathway (Figure 1). Thus, we propose the following aims: 1) To establish the role of SMS against Cn; and 2) To determine the mechanism by which SMS regulates Cn killing.  The studies proposed in this applications are significant and novel at different levels: i) they will establish novel animal models for the study of fungal infection that are more clinically relevant to the human infection than current models; ii) they will define the role of phagocytes in the host response to fungal infections; and iii) they will identify novel regulators of the phagocytes' response against the infection which can be engineered to boost the host immune system."
"9486842","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):           In the United States and throughout the world, cancer incidence and mortality has increased dramatically in both developed and developing nations. Cancer causes ~13% of human deaths with 7.6 million people dying from cancer in 2007. More people in the US die of lung cancer than breast, colon, kidney, and prostate cancers combined. Recent studies show that veterans are 25 to 75 percent more likely to develop lung cancer than people who did not serve in the military; yet therapies for lung cancer and other solid tumors are still limited.  Recent successes  in T cell cancer immunotherapy point to a potential breakthrough in treatment. T cells expressing chimeric antigen receptors or tumor-reactive ?? TCRs have cured patients with advanced metastatic disease. Intrinsic T cell immunity against tumors can be released using mAbs to remove inhibition by checkpoint CTLA-4 and PD-1 receptors which has resulted in a number of cures in melanoma and lung cancer. Yet, significant limitations exist for these therapies. Therapy is limited to certain cancers, not all patients respond to therapy, and there is  significant toxicity. Although showing great promise, additional approaches to cancer immunotherapy are needed.  Treatment with ?? T cells expressing V?2V?2 TCRs is one such therapy that shows promise. In contrast to ?? T cells, the antigen responses of ?? T cells expressing V?2V?2 TCRs are not MHC restricted. The major subset of human ?? T cells use their V?2V?2 T cell receptors to recognize the foreign-microbial isoprenoid metabolite, HMBPP, and the self-metabolite, IPP. Normal cells and tumor cells from a wide variety of tissues can stimulate V?2V?2 cells. V?2V?2 T cells expand to very high numbers during many infections (up to 1 in 2 circulating T cells) and can kill tumor cells and infected cells as well as secrete inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors. Two approaches are being used to treat cancer with V?2V?2 T cells. The first is to immunize with stimulators such as the bromohydrin analog of HMBPP or the aminobisphosphonate, zoledronate, with low-dose IL-2. The second is to adoptively transfer V?2V?2 T cells grown ex vivo. This approach has cured a patient with metastatic kidney cancer, induced remission in another with breast cancer, and induced partial remissions or stable disease in other patients but needs to be made more effective.     Metabolic engineering of bacteria is a new field of study that has focused on altering bacteria for  drug or chemical synthesis. Changes in bacterial metabolism are made by modifying biochemical pathways or by introducing new ones. We have now provided proof-of-principle for this approach by metabolic engineering Salmonella to overproduce HMBPP and demonstrating responses in monkeys. We now propose to improve our Salmonella vaccine and to test a new Listeria vaccine. Both species have been used for cancer vaccines but differ significantly because Salmonella is given orally whereas Listeria is given intravenously. We will use the bacterial vaccines to target and activate adoptively transferred V?2V? 2 T cell in tumors because they preferentially localize to tumor cells.  To accomplish our goals, we will: metabolically engineer bacteria to overproduce HMBPP, test engineered bacteria in vitro and in vivo in monkeys, and assess the ability of metabolically engineered bacteria to target and activate adoptively transferred V?2V?2 T cells to control tumors. We have an outstanding team with an excellent track record and have extensive experience working with ?? T cells and isoprenoid metabolism. We have established in vivo models and techniques. A proof-of-principle Salmonella vaccine has been derived and the results recently published. The molecular methods to create more vaccines are well developed. In conclusion, immunotherapy using metabolically engineered bacterial vaccines with V?2V?2 T cells has the potential to be broadly applicable for the treatment of many different tumors both by direct activation and through adoptive transfer."
"9487127","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Liver fibrosis is the result of chronic liver damage from various etiologies including alcohol abuse, obesity, or viral hepatitis. Chronic liver disease may progress to cirrhosis, an end stage disease and major cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States and in particular among Veterans. Patients with chronic liver disease show intestinal bacterial overgrowth and dysbiosis. They also demonstrate increased intestinal permeability, and disease severity correlates with systemic levels of bacterial products. Although experimental liver fibrosis is dependent on gut derived bacterial products, yet the exact contribution of the commensal microflora to liver fibrosis is unknown. Since the interaction of pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) with the innate immune system can also confer protection to the host, we subjected germfree mice to experimental models of liver fibrosis. Results from our laboratory demonstrate that germfree mice show exacerbated liver fibrosis as compared with conventional mice. Livers of germfree mice have a decreased expression of the antioxidant heat shock protein (Hsp)-25, more oxidative stress and a higher rate of apoptosis. The focus of this application is to further characterize the relationship between the intestinal microflora and the progression of chronic liver disease. We hypothesize that the commensal microflora is an important suppressor of oxidative stress and hence fibrosis upon chronic liver injury in mice. Our experimental approach is to apply mouse models of toxin-induced and cholestatic liver fibrosis to germfree and conventional mice and to investigate the contribution of the bacterial microflora to chronic liver disease (Aim 1). We will then assess the mechanism by which the microflora ameliorates experimental liver fibrosis. The focus will be on Hsp25 that is lower expressed in hepatocytes of germfree mice as compared with conventional mice and that has antioxidant properties. We will test the new concept that bacterial products or metabolites induce Hsp25 in hepatocytes. We will also focus on hepatic stellate cells to explain the phenotype with increased fibrosis under germ-free conditions (Aim 2). We will then supplement germfree mice with one bacterial metabolite or colonize germ-free mice with indole-3-propionic acid (IPA) synthesizing bacteria, and subject them to experimental liver fibrosis. A preventive and therapeutic approach will be chosen. Bacterial products or metabolites might confer antioxidant properties directly or via the induction of antioxidant molecules to the liver (Aim 3). We believe these studies will provide important insights into the contribution of the commensal microflora to liver fibrosis. This will establish a novel shift in the current paradigm that all translocated bacteria and their products are bad for liver injury and chronic liver disease. Eventually this approach might lead to new therapeutic targets and therapies for patients with chronic liver disease."
"9487895","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     The inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA activates several types of receptors that are therapeutic targets for the treatment of epilepsy and other neuropsychiatric illness. GABAA receptors are linked to a Cl ion channel and produce electrical signals when activated at synapses. GABAB receptors are G-  protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) that regulate intracellular signaling pathways. In addition to synaptic GABAA receptors, there are unique GABAA receptors localized to extrasynaptic sites. These high-affinity extrasynaptic GABAA receptors are tonically activated by the low levels of ambient GABA in the brain. The tonic form of inhibition produced by extrasynaptic GABAA receptors importantly affects cellular and network excitability.  Emerging data indicate that extrasynaptic GABAA receptors in several brain regions are regulated by postsynaptic GABAB receptors. Because the intracellular signaling pathways affected by GABAB receptors are shared by many GPCRs, other neurotransmitter receptors may also regulate extrasynaptic GABAA receptors. This proposal describes three hypotheses to investigate the regulation of extrasynaptic GABAA receptors in health and disease.  It is hypothesized that multiple neurotransmitters acting through GPCRs regulate extrasynaptic GABA receptors. Tonic currents produced by extrasynaptic GABAA receptors will be recorded from dentate gyrus granule cells (DGGCs) and CA1 pyramidal neurons in acute hippocampal brain slices using standard whole cell techniques. The effects of intracellular signaling pathways on tonic currents will be investigated. Using selective agonists and antagonists, the effects of other GPCRs (i.e. ß- adrenoreceptors, D2 dopamine receptors, and 5-HT2 receptors) on tonic currents will be determined. It is predicted that tonic currents will be enhanced by PKA inhibition (D2 receptors) and PKC activation (5HT2 receptors). Activation of PKA by ß-adrenoreceptors is predicted to reduce tonic currents. Biochemical studies will be done to determine if intracellular signaling pathways enhance tonic currents by increasing surface expression of GABAA receptors.  Spontaneous physiological or pathophysiological neural activity can produce periodic and transient increases in ambient GABA levels. It is hypothesized that periodic increases in ambient GABA will activate postsynaptic GABAB receptors and enhance extrasynaptic GABAA receptor function. Tonic currents will be repeatedly measured before and during procedures to periodically increase ambient GABA. Three approaches will be used to produce transient increases in ambient GABA; 1. periodic application of exogenous GABA, 2. stimulating release of endogenous GABA (electrical stimulation, high K+), and 3. inducing spontaneous interictal discharges with 4-AP. It will be confirmed that the effects of these procedures resulted from postsynaptic GABAB receptor activation using the GABAB receptor antagonist CGP55845 and pipette solutions containing a G protein inhibitor (GDP-ß-s).  Traumatic brain injury (TBI) alters GABAA receptor function in the hippocampus. It is hypothesized that GPCRs regulate extrasynaptic GABAA receptors following experimental TBI. We will determine the effects of TBI on basal tonic currents and their regulation by GPCRs. Specifically, it is hypothesized that tonic currents of DGGCs will be enhanced by TBI, due in part to increased activation of GPCRs."
"9213302","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):          Every year 150,000 Americans are diagnosed with colorectal cancer (CRC), the second leading cause of cancer-related mortality in the US and is a major health problem among the Veterans. Approximately 4,000 veterans being diagnosed with the CRC each year within VA facilities. CRC development is mostly due to high smoking, unhealthy dietary habits, high alcohol consumption and exposure to hazardous agents, commonly seen in veterans. A significant risk of relapse for post-resection primary CRC or drug resistance after chemotherapy is commonly observed in CRC patients. Thus, to reduce the risk of CRC development in high-risk individuals and improve relapse and survival rates for veterans requires early intervention with safer and novel drugs are warranted. Project hypothesis to be tested: NSAIDs and select COX-2 inhibitors show significant inhibitory effects in CRC patients, but they are also associated with GI toxicity and cardiovascular (CV) risk. Reasons for this risks are an increase in 5-LOX metabolites and reduced synthesis of PGI2 levels. Thus, selective targeting of microsomal PG Synthase-1 (mPGES-1) and 5-LOX would block the protumorigenic PGE2/prothrombotic leukotrienes (LTs) but spare the PGI2, is considered to be an ideal approach to developing efficient and safer colon cancer chemo preventive agents. Toward this end, we have discovered a novel dual mPGES- 1 and 5-LOX inhibitor, LFA-9 by high-throughput and enzyme kinetics assays, and short-term in vivo efficacy studies support further development for CRC prevention/treatment. First series of experiments will focus on: A) Determine the optimal dose, efficacy, dose-response effects of LFA-9 on azoxymethane (AOM)-induced colon cancer in male and female F344 rats. B) Assess the cardiovascular risk/toxicity and prothrombotic events for short-term and long term administration of LFA-9. C) Evaluate the key biomarkers and its correlation with colon tumor inhibition. D) Determine the efficacy of LFA-9 in CRC Patients derived xenograft (PDX) mice model to assess any possible therapeutic benefits. Second series of experiments will be performed with genetically deficient mice (mPGES1-/- - 5-LOX-/-) to assess the relative relevance of mPGES-1 and 5-LOX in colon tumor development. Also, we will determine the role of macrophage specific mPGES-1 and 5-LOX in colon tumor development. To test this, CD11b- DTR mice will be depleted of its macrophages and also macrophages isolated from bone marrow of compound (mPGES1-/- - 5-LOX-/-) mice will be adoptively transferred into CD11b-DTR. CD11b-DTR mice will be used to test AOM/DSS-induced colon tumor formation in the presence of mPGES1-/- - 5-LOX-/- macrophages. A comprehensive and competitive team has been assembled with expertise in the field of colorectal cancer, cancer drug development, understanding mechanisms. The accomplishment of this project will significantly improve the safety and efficacious drugs for the prevention and treatment of CRC patients."
"9378088","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant) This proposal describes experiments designed to understand the mechanisms involved in the control of recovery from bacterial infections. To recover from an infection and return to homeostasis, the host must activate mechanisms capable of controlling the damage caused by pathogen virulence factors, inflammation, and a potentially toxic antibiotic exposure. Failure to properly recover from infections manifests in the form of recurrent infections, inappropriate wound healing, autoimmune diseases, and chronic inflammatory disorders. The mechanisms involved in pathogen recognition and immune activation have been very well studied, but the cellular and systemic responses involved in recovery after an infection is cleared are not well defined. We have established a Caenorhabditis elegans model of acute infection and antibiotic treatment for studying biological changes during the resolution phase of an infection. We found that genes that are markers of innate immunity are downregulated upon recovery, while genes involved in xenobiotic detoxification, redox regulation, and cellular homeostasis are upregulated. Using gene expression profiling, in silico analysis, and reverse genetic approaches, we have linked to the control of recovery from infection to the function of conserved transcription factors, including th GATA transcription factor ELT-2, the FOXO transcription factor DAF-16, and the Nrf transcription factor SKN-1. The proposed experiments will explore the general hypothesis that neural GPCRs and cell non-autonomous signals from different neurons may act on non-neural tissues to regulate recovery from infection at the organismal level. Given the conserved nature of GPCR-mediated signaling and the conservation of the transcription factors involved in the control of recovery, the proposed studies should lead to a better understanding of the mechanisms used by metazoans to control recovery from bacterial infection at the whole animal level."
"9378378","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Project Summary/Abstract The long-term goals of this Merit project are focused on characterizing the roles and mechanisms of actions of vitamin C in skeletal biology since its deficiency induces skeletal fractures. During the last funding period, we identified novel roles fo prolyl hydroxylase domain proteins (PHDs) in regulating articular cartilage (AC) development besides mediating vitamin C effects on osteoblasts (OBs). By using mice with a conditional knockout (cKO) of the Phd2 gene in OBs and chondrocytes, we determined that loss of Phd2 in OBs resulted in osteopenia while chondrocyte-specific KO of Phd2 lead to a dramatic increase in trabecular bone mass caused by increased endochondral bone formation (EBF), thus suggesting distinct roles and mechanisms for PHD2 in the two cell types. New preliminary data described in this proposal show that Phd2 and Phd3 are differentially expressed in the superficial zone (SZ) and middle zone (MZ) of AC, respectively, and that transition of AC chondrocyte progenitors in the SZ into differentiating chondrocytes in the MZ capable of EBF is tightly regulated by relative levels of Phd2 and Phd3 expression. Furthermore, our data show that PHD2 and PHD3 regulate AC chondrocytes by precise control of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)1? and HIF2? levels and by an epigenetic mechanism involving hydroxylation of 5- methyl cytosine (5-mC). Based on these data, our major goal in this competitive renewal application is to elucidate the role of Phd2 and Phd3 in AC development and in the pathogenesis of osteoarthritis (OA), since OA is a significant public health problem in the U.S., posing a substantial financial burden with no available therapies for treatment. We will use new genetic mouse models to test the prediction that dysregulation of Phd2/Phd3 expression in AC contributes to the pathogenesis of OA by involving HIF signaling and epigenetic modification of genome activity. In Specific Aim 1, we will test the hypothesis that loss of Phd2 expression in AC progenitors impairs development and maintenance of AC by promoting HIF1? signaling. We will generate mice in which expression of Phd2 is disrupted in Prg4 expressing AC progenitors and examine the AC phenotype as a function of age and in response to a destabilization of medial meniscus (DMM) injury and determine if the AC phenotype in Phd2 cKO mice is abolished by disruption of Hif1? expression in AC progenitors. In Specific Aim 2, we will test the  hypothesis that loss of Phd3 expression in differentiating chondrocytes regulates the AC phenotype by promoting HIF2? signaling. We will generate mice in which expression of Phd3 is disrupted in aggrecan expressing differentiating chondrocytes and determine if the AC phenotype in Phd3 cKO mice is abolished by disruption of HIF2? signaling. In Specific Aim 3, we will test the hypothesis that Phd2 and Phd3 regulate transition of AC progenitors into differentiating chondrocytes in part via epigenetic control of genome activity via regulating hydroxylation of 5-mC. Successful completion of our proposed studies will provide important information on the pathway by which Phd2 and Phd3 regulate AC and could provide novel PHD-based drug targets for treatment of OA prevalent in aging veterans."
"9379853","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Current methods for identifying links between an individual's exposure to toxic air pollutants and adverse health outcomes suffer shortcomings of limited temporal and spatial granularity in exposure monitoring and the lack of real-time analysis to establish a causal relationship between an individual's exposure profile and impact on health. The goals of this proposal are 1) to provide researchers with a new tool to better assess the impacts of pollutant exposure to respiratory and cardiovascular disease, and 2) to provide individuals with an inexpensive wearable device for real-time reporting of exposure data for personalized alerts and managed care services. In the long term, a significantly improved medical understanding of air toxics would allow more relevant regulation of toxic air pollutants and more effective personal prevention plans. To achieve these goals, we propose to explore several key technologies and approaches that will enable implementation of a novel wearable, autonomous, sensor array microsystem for acute multi-pollutant exposure assessment, with real-time monitoring of toxic gases and volatile organic compounds, initially targeting SO2, NOx, CO, ozone, formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, benzene, and o-nitrobenzene. The proposed exposure assessment microsystem will integrate into an inexpensive thumb-sized device with all of the sensing, signal conditioning and data analysis necessary to overcome the limitations of existing air pollution instruments. These groundbreaking capabilities will be accomplished through innovations including 1) systematic design across all layers of the sensor microsystem to uniquely achieve desired system attributes, 2) development of new, miniaturizable, ionic liquid electrochemical sensors, 3) incorporation of multi-mode electrochemical techniques to enhance analytical information content, enabling sensitivity improvement, automated drift calibration, and sensing of diverse pollutants with a small number of physical sensor elements, and 4) design of computationally efficient sensor array processing algorithms for real-time classification and quantification of target analytes. This project will pursue the following specifc aims: Aim 1: Develop and characterize a miniaturized electrochemical sensor array for detection and quantification of multiple air pollutants, Aim 2: Develop compact, energy efficient, instrumentation electronics and heterogeneous sensor array processing algorithms to enable an autonomous wearable microsystem, Aim 3: Integrate and characterize a model multi-pollutant electrochemical microsystem and benchmark its performance in the field against standard exposure assessment equipment. Through a combination of accuracy, reliability, small size, low power, real-time measurement, and autonomous operation, the proposed system will provide revolutionary capability to individual exposure monitoring and the study, treatment, and prevention of health impacts of acute exposure to air toxics. Our highly skilled, multidisciplinary team has expertise in electrochemical sensor interface design and characterization, integrated microarray and microelectronic instrumentation development, and exposure assessment and health effects of air pollutants."
"9487126","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Quinolones, such as ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin (Levaquin(R)), are the most efficacious and broad- spectrum oral antibacterials currently in clinical use. These drugs are used as front-line treatments for a wide variety of human infections caused by Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria.  The cellular targets of quinolones are the bacterial type II topoisomerases, gyrase and topoisomerase IV. These closely related enzymes are essential to cell survival. Gyrase regulates levels of DNA under- and over- winding and alleviates torsional stress that accumulates ahead of DNA replication forks and transcription complexes. Topoisomerase IV alleviates torsional stress, removes knots and tangles from the genome, and is required for proper chromosomal partitioning. Both enzymes function by passing an intact double helix through a transient double-stranded break that they generate in a separate DNA segment. Quinolones kill bacteria by increasing levels of DNA strand breaks generated by gyrase and topoisomerase IV, effectively converting these enzymes into potent cellular toxins that fragment the genome. Both type II enzymes are physiological targets for quinolones, but their relative importance to drug action appears to be species- and drug-dependent.  There is a growing crisis in antibacterial resistance, and quinolone resistance is becoming prevalent. Initial quinolone resistance is most often associated with specific mutations in gyrase and/or topoisomerase IV. Resistance can range from <10- to >100-fold, depending on whether one or both enzymes are mutated. The most common resistance mutations occur at a serine residue originally described as Ser83 in the GyrA subunit of Escherichia coli gyrase and a glutamic/aspartic acid residue 4 amino acids downstream. Based on functional studies from the Osheroff laboratory and a published structure, these residues are proposed to anchor a water- metal ion bridge that serves as the primary conduit between quinolones and the type II enzymes.  Despite the wide clinical use of quinolones, relatively little is understood regarding their interactions with gyrase or topoisomerase IV. Although amino acid mutations in gyrase and topoisomerase IV that are associated with drug resistance have been documented in thousands of isolates, only a handful of studies have gone beyond identifying mutated residues and addressed the underlying biochemical basis for quinolone resistance. Clearly, there is an urgent need to develop more effective drugs that display activity against resistant strains. Therefore, to address this critical issue, the specific aims of this proposal are: 1) To determine the mechanistic basis for quinolone action and resistance. A variety of biochemical and biophysical approaches will be used. Studies will focus on elucidating quinolone-enzyme interactions and the role of the proposed water-metal ion bridge. 2) To determine the roles of gyrase and topoisomerase IV in mediating quinolone-induced toxicity. Relationships between quinolone potency, efficacy, and resistance in vitro and the relative importance of gyrase vs. topoisomerase IV in mediating drug-induced cell kill will be defined. We will determine physiological levels of quinolone-induced DNA cleavage mediated by both enzymes and the persistence of gyrase- and topoisomerase IV-DNA cleavage complexes in drug-treated cells. 3) To design novel drugs that overcome the most common quinolone resistance mutations in gyrase and topoisomerase IV. Studies will take great advan- tage of preliminary data and mechanistic (Aim 1), cellular (Aim 2), modeling, and competition studies. Our goal is to design drugs that do not rely on the water-metal ion bridge for their primary interaction with the bacterial type II enzymes and do not crossover into the human system. Three lead compounds have been identified.  The primary research models for this study will be gyrase from Mycobacterium tuberculosis and gyrase and topoisomerase IV from E. coli and Staphylococcus aureus and to a lesser extent, Bacillus anthracis. Proposed research benefits greatly from previous studies from the Osheroff laboratory on the mechanism of bacterial and eukaryotic type II topoisomerases and the interaction of these enzymes with quinolones and other drugs."
"9487866","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Our armed forces are routinely exposed to hazardous weapons, pathogens, environmental toxins and, later, medical countermeasures with long-term health effects. The kidney is affected by many toxins metabolized in the body that it excretes, including products of rhabdomyolysis (skeletal muscle degradation), hemolysis, drugs, and exogenous toxins. Many of these compounds cause acute kidney injury (AKI) by producing reactive oxygen species (ROS), which activate apoptotic endonucleases. The resulting acute kidney failure (AKF) is a life-threatening condition that requires hemodialysis or kidney transplantation.  This proposal is a continuation of the previous research funded by a VA Merit Review grant. The specific aims in the previous project have been accomplished and the new goals are logical extensions of these aims. The results from the previous study show that the importance of apoptotic endonuclease G (EndoG) in mediating myoglobinuric AKI is much more complex, not limited to DNA fragmentation only, and in some cases, completely opposite to what was initially accepted. The present proposal is based on our recent unexpected observations that myoglobinuric AKI is mediated by apoptotic deoxyribonuclease I (DNase I) regulated by EndoG. Prior to this study, no regulation of an endonuclease by another endonuclease has been described, and EndoG was considered one of the DNA-fragmenting apoptotic endonucleases. Contrary to this, we found that when EndoG becomes activated by later or stronger injury, it inactivates DNase I and thus protects against the injury. Therefore in the kidney, EndoG acts as cytoprotective enzyme instead of being cytotoxic.  We hypothesize that myoglobinuric AKI can be prevented by inducing of EndoG-mediated inactivation of DNase I or otherwise inhibiting expression or activity of DNase I before and/or after injury. Our specific objectives are as follows. In Aim 1, we will evaluate native DNase I- and alternatively-spliced DNase I-based therapeutic approaches to ameliorate myoglobinuric tubular cell injury and AKI. In Aim 2, we plan to determine how EndoG-mediated inactivation of DNase I can be used to blunt myoglobunuric AKI. Aim 3 will be using our new high throughput technology to screen chemical library for new DNase I inhibitors applicable for the treatment of myoglobinuric AKI.  Potential Impact on Veterans Health Care. Successful completion of these studies can potentially lead to the development of new therapeutic tools to prevent or ameliorate myoglobinuric AKI. Some of them will have strong translational value because they act even if administered after kidney injury, while others can become therapeutic options of the future. When applied to humans, the results of this study may allow saving human lives, improving the health of veterans, and decreasing the number of disabilities in the veteran population."
"9486834","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Mu-opioid receptor (MOR) agonists such as morphine, fentanyl and remifentanil (remi) are the most effective perioperative analgesics for both acute severe postoperative pain and chronic severe pain states. The most serious, life-threatening side effect, which limits their dosage, is profound depression of breathing rate (bradypnea) and tidal volume. This risk is increased in the presence of other sedatives such as benzodiazepines (BZDs) and alcohol. Our studies indicate that neurons in the parabrachial/ K?lliker-Fuse nuclei (PB-KF complex) of the pons are very sensitive to low clinical opioid concentrations associated with bradypnea and have the potential to cause respiratory arrest. We have also discovered that neurons in a small parabrachial subregion (PBSR) control breathing frequency (fB) and appear to be the portal that mediates the opioid-induced bradypnea. Localized excitation of PBSR neurons increase fB, while those that decrease neuronal activity decrease fB even to the point of apnea. Thus, any drugs that affect the activity of PBSR neurons will have a major impact on breathing. Our working hypothesis is the PBSR functions as the major controller of fB by providing excitatory inputs to the rhythmogenic preB?tzinger Complex (preBC) that produces phasic inspiratory (I) and expiratory (E) neuronal discharge patterns. Depression of PBSR neuronal activity by systemically administered opioids alone or combined with sedatives leads to severe bradypnea or arrest. The PBSR also modulates the gain of the reflex control of I-duration (TI) and E-duration (TE) mediated by slowly adapting pulmonary stretch receptors (PSRs). To address the above hypotheses, the following specific aims will be pursued: 1) Precisely locate the PBSR in the dorsal pons near the PB-KF area that controls eupneic fB as suggested by preliminary findings, 2) Identify the PBSR neuron subtypes, determine if their axons project to the preBC/BC region and quantify their responses to PSR inputs, 3) determine how the discharge patterns of the various PBSR neuron subtypes are generated and controlled by A) NMDA and nonNMDA receptor mediated glutamatergic endogenous excitation and B) by GABAergic and glycinergic endogenous inhibition, 4) determine A) whether the GABAA receptors on neurons within this region are modulated by BZDs (e.g., midazolam), B) whether systemically-administered BZDs act on neurons within the PBSR (antagonized by microinjected flumazenil), and C) whether microinjected BZDs modulate the effects of iv remifentanil-induced    bradypnea, 5) determine the role of GABAB receptors in the modulation of PBSR neurons and of TI and TE via microinjections of selective agonists and antagonists, 6) identify preBC neuron subtypes that mediate increases in fB evoked within the PBSR by AMPA stimulation and highly localized electrical stimuli, and 7 A) characterize the modulation of the PSR reflex control of TI and TE mediated by the PBSR, and B) and determine whether this modulation is due to PBSR inputs to the nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS) that alter the PSR neurotransmission to the second order neurons. Systemic i.v. infusions of ultra short-acting remifentanil will be used to produce bradypnea in an in vivo decerebrate canine model. Phrenic nerve activity will be recorded to measure TI and TE. Multibarrel micropipettes and a 16-electrode probe (NeuroNexus) will be used to simultaneously record the discharge of PBSR neurons while picoejecting neuroactive agents. Responses to PSR inputs and axon projections to the preBC region will be used to further classify the PBSR neurons. The PBSR appears to act as the portal through which breathing rate is controlled. Thus, the study of the neurophysiological and neuropharmacological characteristics of this discrete region will provide major insight into the mechanisms by which drugs adversely affect breathing frequency and suggest therapeutic measures to alleviate undesirable side effects. These studies will also provide important new information on the functional roles of PBSR neurons and the contribution of specific neurotransmitters/modulators to the discharge patterns of PBSR neuron subtypes in vivo and new insights into control of breathing mechanisms."
"9378695","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):          Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is one of the most common malignancies among our Veterans. The main goal of this project is to investigate the role of miRNAs in targeting c-Myc/HIF pathway and thus suppress kidney cancer progression and metastasis using both in vitro and in vivo models. The major barrier or clinical challenge is that despite the recent advances in the understanding of the biological basis of RCC, the management of the disease, especially in the advanced metastatic phase, remains a significant challenge. Molecular understanding of pathways associated with kidney cancer progression may lead to better diagnosis, prognosis and therapeutic strategies against kidney cancer. Based on the preliminary data and published literature, c-Myc/HIF pathway is involved in the progression and metastasis of kidney cancer. We have identified a set of miRNAs that can target c-Myc/HIF pathway and thus may play an important role in inhibition of kidney cancer progression and metastasis through targeting this pathway. The rationale is that the c-Myc/HIF pathway coordinates complex multifunctional events and has a wide range of downstream targets that regulate tumor-associated cell processes such as cell growth, cell cycle, survival, migration, epithelial-mesenchymal transition and angiogenesis in kidney cancer. The role of the miRNA network that regulates the c-Myc/HIF pathway is only beginning to be explored and such studies are lacking in kidney cancer. In this project we will investigate the role of a set of miRNAs in regulation of the c-Myc/HIF pathway that in turn inhibit kidney cancer progression and metastasis. To address this problem, we hypothesize that a set of miRNAs may directly target the c-Myc/HIF pathway and thereby inhibit kidney cancer progression and metastasis. To test this hypothesis, we have proposed a series of in vitro and in vivo experiments described under specific aims. Specific Aim # 1. To investigate the mechanisms of miRNA-mediated inhibition of c-Myc/HIF pathway in suppression of kidney cancer progression and metastasis using both in vitro and in vivo models. Specific Aim # 2: To investigate the molecular mechanisms of alteration of a set of miRNAs in kidney cancer. Specific Aim # 3. To investigate whether expression profile of a set of miRNAs can predict clinical outcome of kidney cancer patients. Accomplishment of this project will be a significant step forward in understanding miRNA-mediated suppression of c-Myc/HIF pathway and designing novel miRNA-based therapeutic strategies for inhibition of progression and metastasis of kidney cancer among our Veterans."
"9486887","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Degenerative arthritis is the most common cause of disability in the US and affects more than 50% of the population over age 65. One form of degenerative arthritis, calcium pyrophosphate (CPP) deposition disease (CPPD) is strongly associated with common conditions in the Veteran population including advanced age, prior joint injury and osteoarthritis (OA). While CPP crystals are known to accelerate articular tissue damage though multiple mechanisms, the etiology of CPP crystal formation remains unclear. Overproduction of extracellular inorganic pyrophosphate (ePPi) by chondrocytes is an absolute requirement for CPP crystal formation and enzymatic hydrolysis of extracellular ATP (eATP) by the ecto-enzyme ENPP1 is the rate limiting step in ePPi production. As there is ample ENPP1 on articular chondrocytes to convert all available substrate, it follows that increased concentrations of eATP in cartilage cause CPPD. We recently reported that the multipass transmembrane protein, ANK, which was originally described as a PPi transporter, critically regulates eATP levels in adult articular chondrocyte cultures. ANK is a highly conserved protein which is widely distributed, uniquely structured, and lacks a clearly defined function. The purpose of the work proposed here is to prove that ANK functions as an eATP transporter, that ANK is the dominant ATP efflux pathway in OA chondrocytes, and that ANK suppression with the FDA-approved drug, probenecid will reduce synovial fluid ATP levels in CPPD. The following specific aims will be accomplished with Xenopus oocytes, human and murine chondrocytes, and patients with CPPD. Specific Aim 1. To prove that ANK functions as an ATP transporter by A) demonstrating that ANK increases eATP efflux in a Xenopus oocyte expression system, and B) using site-directed mutagenesis to determine structure-function relationships in ANK null murine chondrocytes Specific Aim 2. To test the hypotheses that ANK over-expression A) causes CPPD in human OA cartilage by dysregulating normal eATP efflux mechanisms in an arachidonic acid-dependent manner, and B) will produce CPP crystals in murine cartilage in the presence of pyrophosphatase inhibitors Specific Aim 3. To demonstrate that probenecid, an ANK inhibitor and FDA approved drug, reduces synovial fluid [ATP] and [PPi] in patients with CPPD. In addition to providing a source of ePPi for CPP crystal formation, eATP produces cartilage damage by signaling through purinergic receptors to elicit catabolic effectors and to cause pain, and serves as a cofactor for innate immune signals leading to inflammation. ANK is a highly conserved protein which is widely distributed, uniquely structured, and remains poorly understood. Once this work is complete, we will understand ANK's role in eATP efflux in normal and OA chondrocytes, have established the feasibility of creating a mouse model of CPPD, and will have collected pilot data rationalizing the use of the ANK inhibitor, probenecid, to improve clinical outcomes in patients suffering from CPPD."

"9378736","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):      Diabetes and its complications are a significant burden on the healthcare system in the United States with nearly $250 billion spent on the care of these patients in 2012. This is even more significant in the VA Healthcare System where the incidence of diabetes is three times as high. Diabetic patients are prone to develop foot and leg ulcers resulting from neuropathy, susceptibility to infection, and microvascular disease. Unfortunately, diabetics have a significantly impaired ability to heal these ulcers and often go on to minor or major limb amputations. These events lead to loss of productivity and associated morbidity and mortality. One of the deficits associated with impaired wound healing in diabetic patients is the excessive production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and insufficient nitric oxide (NO) production. It has been demonstrated that reduction of ROS or delivery of NO to diabetic wounds can improve healing rates and reduce infection. However, NO delivery is hampered by the short half-life of the molecule and its highly reactive state. Xanthine oxidoreductase (XOR) is an enzyme known for its ability to produce ROSs and we identified that it is highly expressed in skin and wounds. XOR has attracted a great deal of attention in the past few years because it can convert the stable compound nitrite back to NO. XOR has been shown to utilize dietary nitrite to mediate the beneficial effects of NO in a variety of disease models. In the wound, preliminary data indicate that XOR plays an essential role in normal wound repair but its role in diabetic wounds remains uncertain. The systemic inhibition of XOR in diabetes appears to improve wound healing while local inhibition further delays healing. In addition, the administration of systemic or topical nitite also improves wound repair. An attractive property of XOR is that it favors the production of NO when nitrite is provided in the setting of hypoxia. When producing NO, XOR mediated ROS production is reduced. These properties are extremely favorable in the setting of chronic wounds where vascularity is diminished with resulting ischemia. In such a setting, administering nitrite may not only induce XOR to generate NO but it may also reduce ROS production. The goal of this proposal is to investigate the precise role of XOR and its products in the diabetic wound repair process. Studies will examine the function of XOR generated NO and ROS in diabetic wounds. The role of XOR in wound neovascularization will be examined to define the importance of the source of the XOR function. These studies will be aided by the use of endothelial cell specific XOR knockout mice. The proposal will culminate in examination of human wounds of different etiologies to quantify XOR activity, the ability to augment local NO production through nitrite supplementation, and the impact of other nitrite reductases in this NO production. The ultimate goal of this proposal is to establish the foundation for developing topical nitrite as a treatment for impaired diabetic wound healing. The extremely attractive aspect of such a therapy is its simplicity, low cost, and the ability to harness the body's own machinery to produce the therapeutic agent. If effective, topical nitrite therapy may also be applied to wounds of other etiologies such as venous stasis and ischemic wounds."
"9534226","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Cranio-lenticulo-sutural-dysplasia (CLSD) is a recessive syndrome with craniofacial, skeletal and neural defects (9). CLSD was originally associated with a homozygous F382L mutation in SEC23A (8). SEC23A is an essential component of COPII vesicles, which are responsible for export of cargo molecules out of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (77). The SEC23A F382L mutation disrupts COPII vesicle assembly (20). Recently, we have identified a novel CLSD case with a heterozygous M702V SEC23A mutation (10, 27). Surprisingly, fibroblasts derived from this patient display a collagen-specific secretion defect. Depletion of Sec23a results in a reduction in the extracellular matrix/collagen and craniofacial/skeletal abnormalities in fish (8, 31). Combined, these findings define a critical link between COPII vesicle biogenesis, secretion of collagen and craniofacial development. In this study we investigate this link. Procollagen forms about a 300nm-long rigid fibril in the ER and requires COPII proteins for export (77). However, because of its size and rigidity, procollagen cannot be packaged into the standard COPII vesicles which have a 60nm diameter. Recently, it was shown that CUL3-KLHL12 drives the assembly of large COPII-coated structures and expedites secretion of collagen (23). However, how COPII proteins generate these megavesicles remains unclear. Our studies have demonstrated that the sizes of these unusually large COPII vesicles, but not the sizes of the standard COPII vesicles, are reduced in M702V SEC23A patient's fibroblasts, suggesting a pronounced lesion in the assembly of COPII megavesicles but not standard COPII vesicles. Additionally, we have recently identified a novel CLSD case in which the patient carries novel compound heterozygous mutations in SEC24D, a cargo- loading subunit of COPII. This is the first reported human disease with a SEC24D mutation. To test the in vivo function of Sec24d, we have generated Sec24d null mice. Sec24d null embryos presented with holoprosencephaly and craniofacial anomaly, features that are known to result from a defect of type II collagen (32). Therefore, the secretion block of collagens and/or other critical factors may account for the skeletal, craniofacial and neural defects of CLSD. Our long term goal is to understand how the COPII vesicle assembly is integrated into the blueprint of vertebrate development. We hypothesize that CLSD is a disease of aberrant COPII megavesicle assembly. We will test this hypothesis by pursuing following questions: 1) what are the molecular features of COPII paralogs that contribute to megavesicle assembly?; 2) what are the mechanisms that regulate the size of a COPII megavesicle?; and 3) what are the roles of COPII megavesicles during embryonic development?"
"9487850","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Coronary heart disease is a major cause of mortality in the US and in our Veterans. Biological approaches to treat the diseased heart using cell delivery have shown only modest therapeutic benefit, in part due to poor cell survival and ineffective electromechanical coupling to the host myocardium. Our previous research demonstrates that delivery of therapeutic cells cultured in an extracellular matrix (ECM) can improve the survival and functionality of the transplanted cells, owing to the structural support of the ECM as a scaffold and the signaling cues they impart to the cells. In particular, we have previously demonstrated the potency of anisotropic nanofibrillar scaffolds in guiding cellular alignment along the direction of the nanofibrils, enhancing cell survival in ischemic tissues, and imparting signaling cues that confer cell function consistent with a non- diseased state. Anisotropic scaffolds may be well-suited for engineering cardiac tissue which also has highly organized cellular structure. In addition, induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) may be a candidate cell source for the generation of autologous therapeutic cardiovascular cells. The long-term objectives of this research are to engineer a three-dimensional vascularized cardiac patch with pre-formed physiological cellular organization to repair ischemic heart disease; and to investigate the basic biological mechanisms underlying ECM-mediated cell-cell interactions that enhance cardioprotection under conditions of ischemia. We hypothesize that a three- dimensionally aligned iPSC-derived cardiac patch with endothelial interactions will provide more functional and viable engineered tissues for repair of myocardial infarction, due to more effective electrical coupling and organized tissue morphology, as well as the activation of cardioprotective nitric oxide signaling imparted by ECM nanopatterning. Accordingly, our specific aims are: 1) To engineer a vascularized aligned iPSC-derived cardiomyocyte (CM) patch and elucidating the molecular mechanisms of ECM-mediated nitric oxide signaling in enhancing iPSC-CM survival and phenotype. The iPSC-derived CMs (iPSC- CMs) and iPSC-derived endothelial cells (iPSC-ECs) will be co-cultured on three-dimensional oriented nanofibrillar collagen scaffolds with culture conditions optimized to promote iPSC-CM cell survival and function within the patch, when compared to patches that lack oriented nanopatterning or vascular interactions. The role of ECM-mediated nitric oxide signaling in enhancing iPSC-CM survival and phenotype will be investigated in the context of gain- and loss-of-function assays. 2) To determine the therapeutic effect of a vascularized aligned iPSC-CM patch for treatment of myocardial infarction. The vascularized oriented cardiac patch will be transplanted onto the epicardium of rats after myocardial infarction. The animals will be monitored over time for functional improvement in cardiac function, wall thickness, and electromechanical coupling. The role of nitric oxide in mediating the functional effects of the aligned vascularized cardiac patch will be quantified by measuring production of nitric oxide and related signaling molecules. The knowledge gained from these studies will provide a stronger foundation of basic knowledge and improved methods for clinical development of engineered cardiac patches, ultimately with the goal of restoring myocardial function to the diseased hearts of our Veterans."

There is no clinical consensus that it is useful to add estrogen replacement therapy (ERT) to postmenopausal women with depression who are being treated with SSRIs. Our preclinical studies address this issue directly. We showed previously in 3 month old ovariectomized (OVX) rats, that estradiol (E2) administered either acutely or longer-term inhibits the SERT so as to produce antidepressant (AD)-like effects. However, E2 also blocks the inhibitory effect of SSRIs on the SERT so as to prevent their AD-like effects. Estrogen receptor ? (ER?) mediates the AD-like effects of E2 whereas ER? activation mediates its ability to block the AD effects of SSRIs. These effects were seen using the technique of chronoamperometry to measure directly SERT function in vivo. Similar results were also obtained with the forced swim test (FST), which provides a more indirect but behavioral assessment of the effects of SSRIs on the SERT. This proposal extends these observations in clinically-relevant ways by examining 1) if the age of the rats influences the effects of E2; 2) whether the length of time from ovariectomy to hormone administration impacts the effects of E2; 3) effects of E2 and age in rats expressing depressive symptoms due to exposure to chronic unpredictable stress (CUS). Although there may be no perfect animal model for the effects of estrogen deprivation in human menopause, older OVX rats are certainly more appropriate for these questions than younger ones. In Specific Aim 1 we will study the effect of age, by using OVX rats 10, 14 and 18 months old, with studies carried out 18 days post-OVX. In Specific Aim 2 we will address the critical window hypothesis of hormone action which predicts that ERT must be administered early after the menopause or after OVX to have a positive effect. We will use 10 month old OVX rats with studies carried out 4 and 8 months post-OVX. I n b o t h A i m s , in vivo chronoamperometry, carried out in anesthetized animals, will be used to measure the clearance of serotonin (5-HT) from extracellular fluid in the CA3 region of the hippocampus, which is an appropriate area of brain to study effects of both ADs and E2. ER subtype-selective agonists as well as antagonists will be used to evaluate the importance of ER subtypes in estrogen's ability to block the SERT as well as its ability to interfere with the inhibitory effect of SSRIs on the SERT. In addition, to behavioral measures will be used to examine effects of chronic hormone or drug administration: (1) the FST to evaluate AD-like effects of the hormones and SSRIs; and (2) the novelty-suppressed feeding test (NSFT) to measure their anxiolytic-like effects. Both agonist and antagonists of specific ERs will be employed to see how they alter the behavioral effects of chronic administration of hormones or SSRIs. Western blot analysis will also be used to study whether age or long term hormone depletion alters levels of ER subtypes and/or their associated signaling pathways and if long-term E2 treatment induces changes in these parameters. A final specific aim examines the effects of E2 in rats expressing depressive symptoms due to exposure to chronic unpredictable stress (CUS). These experiments will be carried out in 3 month old OVX rats to compare results to those obtained already in na?ve rats of the same age. In addition, to study effects of age on the ability of CUS to produce depressive symptomatology, these experiments will also be carried out in 10 and 18 month old OVX rats. Long term effects of E2, sertraline and subtype-selective ER agonists and antagonists will be evaluated using the FST and sucrose preference test. Our overall goal is to provide pre-clinical information relevant for the use of estrogen replacement therapy in peri- and post-menopausal depressed patients."
"9378698","Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive scarring interstitial lung disease (ILD) that affects mainly older adults. Recently, a paradigm shift has occurred wherein the concepts of epithelial cell dysfunction and abnormal wound healing have been placed at center stage as mechanisms driving fibrotic lung remodeling offering new opportunities for therapeutic discovery for IPF. Surfactant protein C (SP-C), an alveolar type 2 (AT2) cell-specific hydrophobic protein that enhances the biophysical activity of surfactant phospholipid, has provided an important clue for understanding epithelial cell dysfunction in IPF pathogenesis as the heterozygous expression of over 50 mutations in the SFTPC gene in humans is associated with chronic ILD. During the current funding period we have shown that sequence alterations in the SP-C primary translation product (proSP-C) associated with clinical ILD phenotypes result in either of 2 distinct aberrant cellular expression patterns, each capable of triggering a series of aberrant cellular responses. ILD-associated, aggregation-prone SP- C isoforms resulting from mutations within the distal COOH domain of the SP-C proprotein (termed ?BRICHOS?) produce vigorous induction of an unfolded protein response (UPR), ER stress, and apoptosis. We have also made the seminal observation that SFTPC mutations found in the more proximal proSP-C COOH linker domain (?Non-BRICHOS?) are mistrafficked to the plasma membrane with a secondary disruption of endosomal / lysosomal function. The induced cellular phenotype includes a late block in macroautophagy, impaired mitophagy, and alterations in general proteostasis repertoires. Building on this, the overall goal of this Merit Review renewal is to now use SFTPC mutants as substrates in vivo to identify and translate molecular mechanisms underlying the disrupted cellular quality control and epithelial dysfunction to the pathophysiology of IPF/ILDs. This proposal will leverage a novel mouse model also generated in the current cycle which expresses the disease-causing clinical non-BRICHOS SFTPC mutant, SP-CI73T, exclusively in AT2 cells. Our Preliminary Data reveals that SP-CI73T mice exhibit alterations in normal proSP-C biosynthetic routing, acquire disruptions in AT2 cell autophagy, and develop diffuse parenchymal lung remodeling. Our experimental approach will be to exploit the unique features of this genetic model combined with tools and reagents available in our program designed to interogate cell quality control and integrated stress responses to first define the ontogeny of and cellular mechanisms mediating the aberrant lung injury, repair, and remodeling responses induced by non-BRICHOS SP-C mutations in vivo [Specific Aim 1]. This will be combined with reductionist studies using primary AT2 cell culures isolated from SP-CI73T mice at key time points in the development of the lung phenotype to characterize the biosynthesis and specific AT2 cellular responses to mutant SP-CI73T in vitro [Specific Aim 2]. Finally, to obtain a more complete model of IPF pathogenesis, the effect of exogenous ?second hits? such as oxidative-nitrative stress and infection on the SP-CI73T mouse lung phenotype will be investigated [Specific Aim 3]. As epithelial dysfunction and susceptibility to injury have not been studied extensively in vivo in the context of fibrotic lung diseases, this approach offers the unique opportunity to comprehensively identify mechanisms mediating responses to the mutant SFTPC substrate by AT2 cells, and to assess the pathways promoting crosstalk between AT2 cells, inflammatory cells and fibroblasts that drive parenchymal remodeling. By understanding the path to epithelial injury from mutant SP-C, the mechanisms identified using these systems can be cross-purposed to better understand the pathogenesis of both sporadic and familial IPF."
"9486823","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death among US Veterans. The most effective therapy is surgical resection, but lung cancer recurs in approximately 50% of patients, most commonly as metastatic disease. This suggests that micrometastatic disease is often already present at the time of surgery, but below the level of detection of our current imaging studies. This is consistent with reports of circulating tumor cells in patients with stage I non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Although metastatic behavior is often considered a late event, these clinical findings suggest that the metastatic process is also operative early in the pathogenesis of the disease. These clinical observations are consistent with recent laboratory-based investigations indicating that dissemination may occur during early tumor development. Furthermore, recent studies implicate the genetic program associated with epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), not only in driving metastatic behavior, but also in transforma-tion and stem cell expansion. Our preliminary studies indicate that key genes in the EMT program are responsible for both transformation and enhanced motility of human bronchial epithelial cells (HBECs). In addition, we find that HBECs expressing genes associated with EMT or common NSCLC driver mutations show marked heterogeneity in their capacity for cell motility. We hypothesize that enhanced epithelial cell motility is operative during premalignancy and is a driver of early metastatic dissemination. The proposed research will elucidate the fundamental mechanisms involved in epithelial cell motility and their potential impact on disease onset and progression by coupling novel in vitro and in vivo models of human lung carcinogenesis and an innovative motility-based cell isolation technique. We anticipate that the proposed investigations will yield a more complete understanding of the molecular determinants of lung cancer pathogenesis, which will stimulate development of more effective chemopre-vention and early detection. Here, we have focused attention on the transcriptional repressor prototype SNAI1 (Snail) as a molecular driver of the high velocity phenotype, because we find that it: 1) is up-regulated in human NSCLC and pulmonary premalignancy in situ; 2) portends a poor prognosis when elevated in early stage NSCLC and mediates tumor-promoting phenotypes in lung cancer, including angiogenesis; 3) is a driver of the stem cell expansion, transformation, and metastatic behavior of HBECs in vitro and in vivo; and 4) is a mediator of the enhanced motility and deformability of HBECs in vitro. As these properties are important for metastatic behavior, we hypothesize that motility may also facilitate lung carcinogenesis and early dissemination via both Snail/EMT-dependent and -independent expression of motility-related genes. The studies proposed in Aims 1 and 2 will identify the motility-based pathway intermediaries that play a role in early metastatic behavior and carcinogenesis in in vitro human models. By determining the prevalence of the leading motility gene candidates in human premalignant lung lesions, subAim 2B will also ensure that our subsequent detailed mechanistic studies are focused on novel drivers of motility that are relevant to the clinical situation they ae intended to investigate (pulmonary premalignancy). Finally, Aim 3 seeks to determine the contribution of the clinically-relevant motility-candidates identified in Aims 1 and 2 to growth an early metastatic seeding in vivo. By coupling 1) innovative approaches to single-cell motility and deformability analysis with 2) a novel model of premalignancy (that includes the capacity to induce transformation to cancer in a human system in mice) and 3) a rare bank of pulmonary premalignant lesions (that ensures the clinical relevance of all findings), we are uniquely poised to identify the mechanisms underlying motility that are critical for early metastatic behavior in situ. This research is a prerequisite for future studies that focus on new biomarkers of disease onset and new targets for early detection, disease monitoring, and chemoprevention for lung cancer."
"9486869","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):           This application is a competitive renewal for 4 years of funding which extends earlier work conducted during the previous grant period. In this application we will enhance our understanding of the neurobiology of white matter changes in schizophrenia by introducing novel tools and methods that are more specific with respect to underlying pathology. This work is highly relevant to the overall VA mission, as patients with schizophrenia utilize 40% of the VA healthcare resources. Historically, the role of white matter in schizophrenia has been largely overlooked, with the majority of biological hypotheses focused on abnormalities in gray matter. This is despite the fact that schizophrenia is now viewed as a dys-connection syndrome, and that it is white matter that provides long-range communication among neurons. Only recently, with the introduction of diffusion MRI (dMRI), has attention slowly shifted to investigating the roe of white matter in schizophrenia. Nonetheless, findings to date have not led to an understanding of the etiology or to new pharmacological treatment(s), primarily because dMRI measures are nonspecific to underlying microstructural pathology. New methods, however, are more specific with respect to pathology, and based on our preliminary data using free-water derived from dMRI, and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), we hypothesize that white matter in schizophrenia is compromised by at least two distinct pathological processes that occur at different stages of the disease, i.e., neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration. Here we will use novel tools and methods to identify the neurobiological nature, time course, and functional consequences of specific changes in white matter in schizophrenia. Specifically, we will use several recently developed MRI acquisition and analysis methods, and apply them to both early onset schizophrenia and chronic schizophrenia populations, as well as to matched healthy controls. In terms of biological hypotheses, we predict that: A) early onset schizophrenia is likel associated with pathology (neuroinflammation) affecting extracellular volume observed using dMRI and magnetic resonance spectroscopy indicators of neuroinflammation; B) chronic schizophrenia is likely associated with increasing cellular pathology (neurodegeneration), observed using dMRI and MRS measures; and, C) both neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration have an effect on axonal conduction transmission speed, evinced using an interhemispheric transfer task, and localization of these changes will predict clinical profile. Longitudinal changes will also be evaluated one year later in the early psychosis patients in order to determine progressive changes in white matter over this time period. The investigation of dMRI, MRS, and EEG methods in schizophrenia will lead to novel findings of white matter abnormalities in schizophrenia, including new information about the role of neuroinflammation and neurodegenerative processes that occur at different stages of the disorder, which, in turn, will provide a new perspective on possible treatment interventions that will likely involve anti-inflammatory agents early in the course of illness."

"9487904","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         The recent breakthrough in hypertension research reveals that a novel WNK kinase family [(with-no- lysine (K)] and its two key down-stream substrates SPAK (Ste20/SPS1-related proline/alanine-rich kinase) and its homolog OSR1 (oxidative stress-responsive kinase 1) are evolutionarily conserved regulators of ion transporters by altering their net phosphorylation state and play an important role in renal salt handling and in the pathogenesis of hypertension. Na+-K+-2Cl- cotransporter isoform 1 (NKCC1) transports 1Na+, 1K+, and 2Cl- ions into cells and is important in regulation of intracellular Na+ and Cl-, cell volume, and K+ uptake in the central nervous system (CNS) under physiological conditions. Previous studies from our lab and others' clearly indicate that over-stimulation of NKCC1 activity contributes to cerebral ischemic damage. Under ischemic conditions, NKCC1 activation causes intracellular Na+ and Cl- overload in astrocytes and neurons. The intracellular Na+ overload subsequently stimulates the reverse mode operation of Na+/Ca2+ exchange and leads to a delayed, secondary cytosolic Ca2+ rise and Ca2+ dysregulation in ER and mitochondria. Most importantly, either pharmacological inhibition or genetic ablation of NKCC1 shows significant neuroprotective effects in in vivo focal ischemia model (middle cerebral artery occlusion, MCAO) and in vitro ischemia model. Despite of the neuroprotective effects in ischemic brain damage by blocking NKCC1 activity, it remains unknown how NKCC1 protein is stimulated in ischemic brains and what are the up-stream regulatory mechanisms.  Our pilot study revealed robust stimulation of the WNK-SPAK/OSR1 signaling pathway in ischemic brains. The goal of this project is to investigate whether the cerebral WNK3-SPAK-NKCC1 signaling pathway contributes to ischemic brain damage and whether blocking the WNK3/SPAK kinases with a newly discovered WNK-SPAK pathway inhibitor STOCK1S-50699 or transgenic knockout of WNK3 (WNK3 KO), or SPAK (SPAK KO) is neuroprotective. Our preliminary study shows that WNK3 KO mice exhibited significantly reduced infarct volume, less axonal demyelination, and accelerated neurobehavioral recovery. New data in this resubmission illustrates a ~70% reduction in infarct volume in SPAK KO mice. These data provide fresh insight into the role of ion transporters and their regulatory kinases in ischemic neuroglial injury. Completion of this project will help us to determine whether the WNK3-SPAK kinase complex presents a compelling target for novel neuroprotective strategies for ischemic brain injury. Our study will pave a foundation for developing new WNK-SPAK inhibitors for ischemic brain damage therapy."
"9487892","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):        Neuroinflammation following TBI exacerbates neuronal and glial death and dysfunction. The monocyte- derived macrophage response is harmful in TBI. However, macrophages are a broadly heterogeneous population and polarized subsets can be critical for wound repair. Our goal is to identify harmful and beneficial components of the innate immune response to TBI and to define when they arise, to identify optimal targets and timing for therapeutic intervention. The ultimate goal is to block harmful responses and enhance reparative ones to improve long-term functional outcomes of TBI.  Our recently published study showed that Ccr2-/- mice had reduced monocyte-derived brain macrophages and improved outcomes post-TBI. We hypothesize that pharmacological blockade of human CCR2 will improve TBI. Our new data shows that a CCR2 antagonist, CCX872 (in Phase II clinical trials for nephropathy), given 5 min after TBI in mice expressing human CCR2 blocked 83±2% of the macrophage infiltrate. Aim 1. Determine the therapeutic benefit of the human CCR2 antagonist, CCX872, given after TBI, to mice expressing human CCR2 to inhibit macrophage infiltration into the brain, and to improve pathologic and behavioral outcomes.  1a. Determine the effective dose range and time window of hCCR2 antagonist, CCX872, administered after  TBI to block macrophage infiltration to the brain.  1b. Determine the effective dose range and time window of hCCR2 antagonist, CCX872, administered after  TBI to improve behavioral functions and histopathology.  Our previous published work and our new preliminary single-cell RNA sequencing studies indicate that TBI macrophages are diverse and are not limited to the M1/M2 paradigm. We hypothesize that multiple monocyte- derived macrophages and microglia subsets develop after TBI. Aim 2. Define the diversity of monocyte-derived macrophages and resident microglia in the brain post- TBI by the use of single-cell, whole-transcriptome analysis.  2a. Define the monocyte-derived brain macrophage subsets post-TBI by performing single-cell RNA seq.  2b. Define microglia subsets post-TBI by performing single-cell RNA seq.  In the absence of CCR2, a macrophages subset still infiltrates the injured brain after TBI, and is associated with improved outcomes. We hypothesize that CCR2-independent macrophages are protective in TBI. Aim 3. Determine the expression profile, functional role, and requirement for CCR2-independent macrophages in post-TBI outcomes.  3a. Define CCR2-independent macrophage subsets in the brain after TBI by single-cell RNA seq.  3b. Define the functional nature of the CCR2-independent macrophage response to TBI by examining  phagocytosis, cytokine production, and T cell suppressor function by these cells.  3c. Determine if CCR2-independent macrophages are beneficial or harmful by depleting them with  clodronate liposomes in Ccr2-/- mice after TBI and determining the effects on TBI outcomes.  This work will provide the preclinical basis and design for targeting CCR2 in TBI therapy. Furthermore, the work will provide an unprecedented view of macrophage biology in the specific context of TBI. These studies will lead to informed approaches for altering neuroinflammation to improve outcomes for veterans."
"9593408","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Most bacterial pathogenesis studies have focused on mono-culture infections; however it is clear that many bacterial infections are not simply the result of colonization with a single species, but rather ensue from the action of polymicrobial communities. Microbes within polymicrobial infections often display synergistic interactions that result in enhanced colonization and persistence in the infection site. Such interactions have been particularly noted in wound infections, although the molecular processes controlling these synergistic interactions are generally not known. Detailed mechanistic studies of the polymicrobial interactions required for enhanced persistence in vivo are a necessary first step towards developing therapeutics to treat polymicrobial infections. The overall goal of this research plan is to determine how interactions between Pseudomonas aeruginosa and other microbes that commonly co-infect wounds impact wound severity. To accomplish this goal, in vivo murine wound models and high-throughput genomics techniques will be employed to identify and characterize microbial genes required for enhanced pathogenesis during co-infection."
"9486829","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):        Background/Rationale: Angiogenesis - formation of new capillary blood vessels is a fundamental process essential for healing of tissue injury, e.g. gastric erosions (GE) and ulcers (GU). Gastric mucosa of aging humans and rats (aging gastric mucosa) exhibits increased susceptibility to injury, impaired angiogenesis and delayed healing. [Our overall hypothesis is that nerve growth factor (NGF) is critical for gastric endothelial cell (EC) viability, function, angiogenesis and GU healing, and that NGF deficiency in aging ECs is the major mechanism of aging-related impairment of gastric angiogenesis and GU healing in aging individuals.] The rationale for this hypothesis stems from our preliminary studies showing that: 1) aging gastric ECs (AGECs) have reduced expression of NGF, and NGF protein and/or NGF gene therapy restores in vitro angiogenesis in aging ECs cells and reverses NSAIDs-induced inhibition of angiogenesis, and [2) local treatment of GU in aging rats with NGF significantly increases local expression of NGF and VEGF, angiogenesis, accelerates ulcer healing, and improves mucosal regeneration.] Our specific objectives are to determine whether and to what extent: 1) NGF and its signaling are critical for gastric ECs viability, function and angiogenesis and to identify the underlying molecular mechanisms; 2) NGF deficiency is: (a) crucial mechanism for ECs' aging and for aging-related impairment of EC proliferation and angiogenesis and (b) whether NGF treatment or NGF gene therapy restores in vitro angiogenesis in aging ECs; [3) Local treatment of GUs in aging rats with NGF will improve vascular regeneration and GU healing and whether these events can be visualized in vivo and in real time using confocal laser endomicroscopy (CLE).] Our long-term objective is to uncover novel mechanisms that regulate gastric angiogenesis and its impairment in aging, to provide a basis for the therapeutic use of NGF to improve angiogenesis and healing of GU in aging individuals and to use CLE for in vivo assessment of GU healing, vascular regeneration and for identifying GU scar abnormalities that may be the basis for the ulcer recurrence. Design: Since ECs are critical targets and effectors of angiogenesis, in in vitro studies in ECs isolated from gastric mucosa of young and aging rats we will determine the mechanisms underlying aging related impairment of EC functions, expression of NGF, VEGF, their receptors, PI3K/Akt and MAPK signaling, and the role of NGF in EC survival, migration, proliferation and angiogenesis. Next we will examine in vivo in aging and young rats sequential events of GU healing and vascular regeneration and will determine whether locally injected NGF will improve GU healing in aging rats and prevent NSAIDs-induced GU recurrence. We will also determine human relevance of our experimental findings using human specimens of GUs from young and aging individuals. Significance: The central topic of our project is neovascularization, injury healing and impact of aging. In 2006, ~39 million Americans (12% of population) were 65 years of age or older, and this number is projected to reach ~70 million by 2030. This population is at high risk of tissue and organ injuries, and GU complications. Impaired angiogenesis in aging is a key factor in delayed healing, morbidity and mortality. [Recent studies indicate that the incidence of non-H. pylori, non-NSAIDs ulcers (idiopathic ulcers) is increasing and they constitute up to 30% of all ulcers and patients with a history of idiopathic bleeding ulcers have a high risk of recurrent ulcer bleeding and a high mortality 83 - 92%. Therefore the GU recurrence and its complications still remain important clinical issue, especially in aging and severely ill patients.] The proposed studies will provide insight into novel mechanisms and the regulatory role of NGF and angiogenesis in GU healing and their relation to aging-related impairment of these processes. This novel information can be applicable to other areas of mucosal healing including inflammatory bowel disease, esophageal erosions and ulcers, as well as to cancer-related neovascularization."
"9486885","The proposed study is a cross-sectional and longitudinal, repeated measure, case-control multi- site study of Veterans with a history of OEF-OIF combat exposure. The purpose of this research is to examine the potential late-life effects of mTBI including possible neurodegenerative disorders such as CTE. The overall goals of this proposed large, longitudinal cohort study of Veterans with and without mTBI after OEF-OIF combat exposure are to (1) disentangle the role of mTBI(s) in their later life outcomes including but not limited to neurodegeneration, and (2) seek converging behavioral and biological evidence for CTE. The facilities engaged in recruiting and enrolling participants are McGuire VAMC in Richmond, James Haley VAMC in Tampa, South Texas Veterans Health Care System in San Antonio, and Michael DeBakey VAMC in Houston. To achieve these aims, all subjects will undergo an initial comprehensive assessment to determine the prevalence, type, and intensity of residual symptoms and impairments potentially attributable to TBI. Individuals with a history of TBI will be compared to controls with combat exposure and no history of TBI. All subjects will then undergo periodic (three years follow up and then every five years), in-person and annual telephonic reassessment to monitor the status of their condition and to assess for evidence of biologic, behavioral, cognitive, neurologic, and functional changes. In this way, the functional and biologic late effects of mTBI and their potential neurodegenerative decline over time will be delineated. In addition to descriptive statistics, the cross-sectional study will assess the association of mTBI and time from injury to current status while adjusting for multiple covariates including age and PTSD. The testing of differences between mTBI and controls will be powered by the primary outcome, cognitive function. Other outcome measures were assembled to measure all potential moderators of mTBI outcome and to track longitudinally the broad range of potential biologic markers, symptoms, impairments, comorbidities and disability known to be associated with TBI outcome and those purportedly linked to neurodegeneration. Physiologic, anatomic, and biologic tests posited to identify preclinical neurodegeneration will be conducted in parallel with cognitive testing; physical and sensory performance measures; and psychological, functional, disability, and global outcome measures. Criteria for participation This study of 1,100 combat-exposed OEF-OIF Veterans is expected to yield approximately 880 participants (80%) with at least one mTBI and 220 participants (20%) without any history of mTBI (referred to as controls). The inclusion criteria are (1) a history of OEF-OIF combat tour, and (2) a Combat Exposure Scale (CES) score > 1 on any item (light or higher). Thus, to ensure that cases and controls have similar environmental history, all participants will have exposure to stressful combat situations during OEF-OIF. All persons regardless of sex, race, or ethnicity will be included. Those with history of moderate or severe TBI, or other major neurologic disorder, will be excluded."
"9581765","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  While the rapidly evolving nanotechnology has shown promise in electronics, energy, healthcare and many other fields, there is an increasing concern about the adverse health consequences of engineered nanomaterials. In vivo studies have shown that inhaled carbon nanotubes can rapidly enter the lung interstitium to stimulate collagen production and induce progressive interstitial lung fibrosis, which is a fatal and incurable disease with no known effective treatment. To evaluate the toxicity of nanomaterials, animal studies are necessary but costly, time-consuming and facility limited; while the majority of current in vitro models suffer from a series of drawbacks, most importantly, they lack characteristics of in vivo microenvironment, leading to losses of critical in vivo cell phenotypes and responsiveness. There is, therefore, a critical need to develop in vitro models of physiological relevance to provide reliable, rapid and inexpensive methods for toxicology studies and risk assessment of nanomaterials. The extracellular matrix of lung interstitium manifests significant nanoscale topographies, exhibits various degrees of stiffness, and is enriched with interstitial fluids. The physiological breathing movements also provide cyclic mechanical strain. Although the physical (substrate nanotopography and stiffness) and mechanical (fluid-induced forces and mechanical strain) cues critically influence numerous developmental, physiological and pathological processes in vivo and have a profound influence on cell phenotype and function in vitro, there has been no effort reported on integrating these factors into a single platform for toxicology studies. Our hypothesis is that the interstitial fibrotic response to nanomaterials in vitro can be more accurately evaluated in a physiologically relevant microenvironment. Therefore, the objective of this project is to develop an alveolar interstitium model integrated with the physical and mechanical cues of physiological relevance to investigate nanomaterials induced lung fibrogenesis. We have assembled an interdisciplinary research team to carry out nanotoxicology studies both in vivo and in vitro, and provided strong evidence that nanotopography, stiffness and fluidic shear stress have profound influences on cell behavior. Based on the compelling preliminary results, we propose two Specific Aims in this project: (1) dissect substrate nanotopography and stiff modulated human lung fibroblast sensing nanomaterials, and (2) build a microfluidic platform integrated with key physical, mechanical and structural characteristics of lung interstitium to assess nanomaterials induced fibrogenesis. Successful completion of this project will advance our fundamental understanding of physical and mechanical modulation of cell behavior and develops a novel, biomimetic interstitium microenvironment to advances over the ?classic? in vitro cytotoxicity methods. This biomimetic model is expected to fill the knowledge and technology gaps between current in vitro models and animal studies, and potentially promote sustainable development of nanotechnology."
"9575325","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of this study is to investigate the modulatory effects of acute and chronic nicotine exposure on reinforcement learning for monetary rewards. Nicotine, the primary addictive component in tobacco, is a weak reinforcer that does not induce robust euphoric effects like other drugs of abuse (e.g., cocaine, alcohol), yet produces a higher rate of dependence among tobacco users than among users of other addictive drugs. A potential explanation of this paradox is that nicotine amplifies the salience of other stimuli that have some incentive value and prolonged exposure could result in dysregulated reward processing. Reinforcement learning is the process of learning what actions to take to maximize reward, and may be the mechanism by which nicotine amplifies the incentive value of other stimuli. A key component of reinforcement learning is the prediction error, which is the difference between the actual and the expected reward outcome. Neuroimaging studies have shown that BOLD activation in the mesocorticolimbic pathway correlates with prediction errors during reinforcement learning paradigms. The overarching aim of this proposal is to use neuroeconomic models of reinforcement learning to study the acute and chronic effects of nicotine on motivational behavior and prediction error-related neural activation using a task with probabilistic outcomes and fMRI. Nonsmokers will be scanned following acute nicotine and placebo administration, and smokers will be scanned following normal smoking behavior and 24-hours of smoking abstinence. This proposal will bridge the gap in the literature between neuroeconomic and addiction research and these results will inform whether the initiation and maintenance of smoking behavior could be facilitated by the effects of nicotine on reinforcement learning. The Principal Investigator (PI) will be mentored and advised by a team of faculty with expertise in nicotine psychopharmacology, fMRI, and neuroeconomics. The institution provides exceptional facilities and departments dedicated to these three fields of research. In addition to learning how to design and conduct clinical nicotine research, this training plan with provide the PI with the opportunity to integrate several distinct, yet overlapping, fields of research in order to explore new approaches to understanding the etiology of nicotine addiction. This proposal builds upon the PI's previous pharmaco-MRI experience, and will allow her to develop new skills while contributing to research on the effects of nicotine on decision-making behavior in humans. The education, training, and research goals described in this proposal will provide the applicant with the research experience necessary to become a successful independent investigator."
"9378386","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):          The overall goal of this MERIT review grant application is to characterize polyphenols as potential prophylactic as well as therapeutic agents in veterans with depression. The proposed studies have important implications for the veteran population since approximately 30% of veterans, in particular those from Operation Enduring Freedom/Operation Iraqi Freedom, are affected by mood anxiety disorders, especially depression. We recently identified a safe and well-tolerated bioactive polyphenol preparation effective in delivering multiple (16 that we identified) bioavailable polyphenol metabolites to the brain. Moreover, we found that oral supplementation with this preparation significantly promotes resilience to depression/anxiety phenotypes in the repeated social defeat stress (RSDS) mouse model of depression. Synaptic plasticity abnormalities in nucleus accumbens (NAc) medium spiny neurons (MSN) play a key role in the development of stress-related depression/anxiety. Our proposed studies are designed to identify select polyphenol metabolites that can preserve synaptic plasticity in vitro i primary NAc MSN-enriched cultures and in vivo in the RSDS model. Our evidence indicates that down-regulation of Rac1 (a GTPase-related protein that controls actin remodeling) in NAc MSNs is central to aberrant synaptic remodeling in depression/anxiety, and that resilience to depression/anxiety may also be augmented by attenuation of excitatory VGLUT2 and/or promotion of inhibitory VGAT MSN synaptic mechanisms. Based on this evidence, in the proposed studies, we will first screen individual polyphenol metabolites for their in vitro dose-response bioactivities in modulating Rac1, VGLUT2, and VGAT in MSN- enriched cultures. Based on the outcomes of the in vitro screening, we will then prioritize the three most bioactive candidates and conduct dose-finding studies in vivo using polyphenol precursors as potential pro- drugs able to deliver the identified metabolites to the brain. Based on the outcomes of this  set of studies, we will identify the lowest safe and efficacious doses of polyphenol precursors with sufficient concentration to engage the molecular targets (e.g. Rac1) in the NAc. In efficacy studies, we will then test whether these brain bioavailable bioactive metabolites delivered through precursors may promote resilience to stress-induced depression/anxiety phenotypes by normalizing stress-induced pathological neuroplasticity remodeling and functional electrophysiological changes in the NAc. Collectively, the outcomes from our proposed studies will identify novel prophylactic as well as therapeutic agents that can prevent and reverse the maladaptive behavioral responses that result from chronic stress. The proposed studies will also provide novel mechanisms underlying the beneficial role of polyphenols on stress-mediated depression. The proposed studies will provide the impetus for translational application of safe polyphenol pro-drugs to promote psychological resilience to stress-related conditions, including depression and anxiety disorders in veterans."
"9378708","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):          Veterans suffer at a disproportional rate from squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN) due to carcinogen exposure from tobacco and alcohol. Despite aggressive treatments, SCCHN is a devastating disease that portends an overall 5-year survival of only ~50%. A comprehensive genomic analysis of SCCHN revealed that ~30% of these tumors overexpress a gene that encodes a calcium-activated chloride channel (TMEM16A/ ANO1). Mechanistic studies have shown that TMEM16A contributes to tumor cell growth by activating the EGFR-ERK1/2 pathway. EGFR is the only FDA-approved molecular therapeutic target in SCCHN, yet the critical therapeutic biomarker(s) that predict response to anti-EGFR therapy remains unknown. Here, we propose to investigate the how TMEM16A and EGFR interact with each other to promote tumor growth and progression. We propose the following studies: 1) determine whether chloride flux through TMEM16A is necessary and sufficient to activate EGFR signaling; 2) examine how TMEM16A interacts with EGFR, and if this interaction is necessary for tumor cell growth; and 3) use a patient samples and tissues derived from a mouse model of carcinogenesis to determine if TMEM16A expression / TMEM16A-EGFR interaction is required for the development of oral dysplasia and ultimately progression to invasive carcinoma. At the conclusion of this project, we intend to implicate TMEM16A as a direct therapeutic target for the treatment of Veterans with OSCC."
"9378086","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Abstract  Stroke is a major medical concern for United States military veterans. Disruption of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) is a catastrophic event in the pathogenesis of ischemic/reperfusion (I/R) brain injury. Our recent studies suggested that structural alterations in brain endothelial cells (EC), including abnormal actin polymerization and the resulting redistribution of junctional proteins, is a novel mechanism responsible for early BBB leakage after I/R (30 min-3h); while matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) 2/9 activation, a predominant mechanism thought to contribute to post-stroke BBB disruption, contribute to the BBB leakage to larger molecules (>40kDa) in a relatively delayed manner. Therefore, restoring EC structure/function may offer an innovative therapeutic strategy for early BBB protection against I/R, while blocking MMP2/9 may provide a relatively delayed protection to BBB.  Heat shock protein 27 (HSP27), a member of the small heat shock protein family, confers neuroprotection in several models of CNS diseases, including I/R brain injury. In addition to its well-known protein chaperone and anti-apoptotic functions, HSP27 may act as a potent actin depolymerization factor in certain cell types such as EC, thus potentially inhibiting actin polymerization-mediated BBB disruption. Further, HSP27 may inhibit the activation of NF-kappaB, a central signaling molecule for the production of MMP2/9 and pro-inflammatory mediators. We recently observed that HSP27 is transiently upregulated in brain EC after I/R. However, the precise role of HSP27 in the functional integrity of EC following I/R and the underlying mechanism remain unknown.  Using transgenic mice overexpressing HSP27 and the lentiviral gene-transfection approach, we have obtained novel pilot data showing that HSP27 overexpression protects the endothelium from I/R-induced hyperpermeability in vitro and in vivo; that HSP27 inhibited oxygen glucose deprivation-induced actin polymerization and redistribution of junctional proteins in EC; and that intravenous administration of HSP27 containing a cell permeable transduction domain (TAT-HSP27) enabled rapid delivery of the protein into brain micro-vasculatures, reduced BBB damage and inhibited MMP2/9 activity after I/R. This proposal will further explore the BBB protective effect of HSP27 on I/R brain injury and elucidate the underlying mechanisms. The central hypothesis to be tested is that HSP27 protects BBB against I/R injury by stabilizing EC cytoskeletal organization in microvasculature early after I/R and inhibiting the production of MMP2/9 as well as pro-inflammatory proteins. The following specific aims are proposed:  Aim 1: To determine whether endothelial targeted overexpression of HSP27 is sufficient to provide early protection on BBB integrity and to confer long term protection against cerebral I/R.  Aim 2: Test the hypothesis that HSP27 protects endothelial integrity following I/R by dualistic mechanisms: stabilizing the actin cytoskeleton and inhibiting NFkB-dependent MMP2/9 production and inflammation.  Aim 3: Test the hypothesis that post-stroke delivery of TAT-HSP27 to EC protects against BBB damage and improves outcomes in both young adult and aged mice.  The proposed study attempts to develop HSP27 into a novel, clinically feasible therapeutic strategy to ameliorate post-stroke BBB damage, brake down the progression of brain damage, and improve long-term neurological functions in stroke victims. The successful completion of this proposed study will help improve the quality of life for veterans suffering from stroke."
"9487101","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     The ultimate goal of this study is to define pharmacological interventions that impact the inflammatory state in the cigarette smoke exposed lung. The immune response in the lung is composed of tissue-specific responses often to environmental agents that require the coordinated response by multiple immune and non-immune cells. When this becomes dysregulated, then pathologies related to excessive pro-inflammatory responses or fibrosis can result. The VA patient population is particularly at risk because of the disproportionate number of individuals who use cigarettes. In the lung a major target of nicotine is the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) alpha7 (?. This receptor has an exceptionally high permeability to calcium that alone can modulate intracellular signaling pathways regulating of transcription factors, cytokines and chemokines. This project will use newly developed mouse models designed specifically to study the ?inflammatory interaction with cigarette smoke (CS) in the mouse lung and will focus on identification of specific cellular signaling mechanisms controlling this response in alveolar and interstitial macrophages, as well as non-hematopoietic cells of the lung. The overall proposal hypothesis is: Modulation of the nicotinic ?calcium current modifies tissue-specific intracellular signaling pathways in the lung in response to cigarette smoke. We will test this hypothesis in 3 Specific Aims: In Aim 1 the hypothesis is: Susceptibility to lung damage and compartmentalized inflammatory control is determined by cell-specific ?expression. The preliminary data reveal that alveolar macrophages (AMs), granulocytes, and interstitial cells (hematopoietic and non-hematopoietic) express ? and the expression level in individual animals corresponds to the magnitude of the inflammatory response. The results will for the first time allow us to define how CSand the nicotine in CS, acts through ?to govern the inflammatory response by cells as they transition from a normal to a pro-inflammatory environment. In Aim 2 the hypothesis is: Calcium signaling through the ?receptor activates cell signaling pathways that control the magnitude of the pro-inflammatory response. Newly developed mouse models that specifically restrict ?calcium channel permeability will be used to define transcriptional and proteomic impacts of this restricted signaling on the nicotine:CS inflammatory response. Finally in Aim3 the hypothesis tested is: The ?calcium mediated signaling pathway(s) contribute to expression of M-CSF and GM-CSF by both lung macrophages and alveolar epithelial cells. We have already found evidence of perturbation of the CSF-signaling system controlled by the ?calcium signaling pathway. We will build upon this preliminary finding and apply our new findings to test the use of potential therapeutic interventions to manipulate the cellular responses dysregulated by CS and the nicotine: ?nteraction to restore a more normal response. At the conclusion of this project we will offer novel insights into the mechanisms controlling the impact of CS on the lung and how the susceptibility to subsequent pathologies may be approached to impact upon this important VA patient issue."
"9487103","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Objectives: The main objectives of this proposal are to: (1) define how oncogenic EGFR/MAPK signal transduction influences the expression of MHC molecules and, (2) characterize the impact of therapies that target the EGFR and enzymes in the MAPK pathway on anti-tumor immune responses and the response to immunotherapy. Research Plan: In Aim 1, we will use well-characterized cell lines to model human cancers driven by EGFR over-expression, oncogenic RAS mutations, and oncogenic BRAF mutations. These cell lines will be used to determine how oncogenic EGFR/MAPK signal transduction and the medications developed to combat this signaling, impact the transcriptional and epigenetic regulation of MHC class I expression. In Aim 2, we will couple these same medications with relevant murine tumor models to determine how these medications impact in vivo immune responses to tumor challenge, the expression of relevant immune system genes, and the response to immunotherapies such as immune checkpoint blockade and therapeutic vaccination. Methods: Using the above models, we will combine EGFR, BRAFV600E, and MEK1/2 inhibitor treatment with chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments to define the impact of EGFR/MAPK signaling on the recruitment of transcription factors and the placement of epigenetic marks at the MHCI promoter. Using reporter assays, we will define regions within MHC class I promoters that are responsive to EGFR/MAPK signaling. To explore more complex regulatory mechanisms, we will investigate how EGFR/MAPK signaling impacts the function of an enhancer-blocking DNA element known to regulate MHC expression. We will also determine how EGFR/MAPK signaling impacts the recruitment/binding of CTCF, a protein that regulates MHC expression by mitigating complex chromatin interactions, to sites within the MHC. For our in vivo studies, we will use therapy- responsive and non-responsive tumor models to determine how EGFR/MAPK inhibitors impact tumor growth, the generation of tumor-reactive and antigen-specific CD8+ T cells, and the tumor microenvironment using flow cytometry, functional cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) assays, RNA analysis and other approaches. We will explore the novel hypothesis that these medications have clinically relevant tumor-dependent and tumor- independent effects on host anti-tumor immunity that can be used to enhance the response to immunotherapy. Clinical Relevance: Inhibitors of the EGFR and MAPKs are already used to treat Veterans with advanced cancer with variable response rates. To help integrate these medications with new and developing therapies that are immune based, it will be crucial to have a sophisticated understanding of how these kinase inhibitors influence immune events in vivo. Indeed, despite the fact these inhibitors are already being combined with immunotherapies in clinical trials for those with advanced cancer, their impact on the immune system is largely undefined. By characterizing how these medications influence immune responses, we can develop a rational framework to optimize the use of these medications alone and in combination with immune-based therapy. In addition, by defining the mechanisms that govern EGFR/MAPK-mediated MHC repression, new approaches can be developed to disrupt the MHCI down regulation and resulting tumor cell immune escape that occurs commonly in cancer."
"9378377","Cardiovascular disease increases markedly with advancing age in our Veteran population. In aging, myocardial injury is increased during ischemia (ISC)-reperfusion (REP) and leads to heart failure. Mitochondrial-driven injury during ISC-REP in aged hearts is mediated by the electron transport chain (ETC) due to increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and damage to the mitochondrial phospholipid cardiolipin (CL). Most therapeutic strategies that effectively decrease cardiac injury in younger hearts fail in aged hearts. In contrast, we found that a transient, reversible inhibition of ETC complex I during early REP decreased injury in the aged heart. The key mechanism and target of protection at the cellular level that mediates ETC-driven protection remains a critical unanswered question.  In addition to mitochondria (MITO) damage, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress contributes to cardiac injury. MITO and ER are juxtaposed through shared structures of mitochondria-associated membranes (MAM). MAM contribute a critical role in calcium regulation and lipid metabolism between MITO and ER. Disruption of MAM integrity likely mediates pathologic ?cross talk? between ER and MITO and increases cardiac injury. We found that CL exists in MAM and the ER with a composition distinct from MITO. Our previous work showed that CL content in MITO is decreased and exhibits an increase in oxidized CL content following ISC-REP in the aged heart. ER is a key site for the remodeling/repair of damaged CL. We hypothesize that CL is a key mediator of the ?cross talk? between MITO and ER via the MAM, and that trafficking of damaged CL to ER via the MAM is a mediator of MAM disruption in the aged heart during ISC-REP.  Age-induced ETC defects increase ROS production. MITO ROS can damage MAM and activate ER stress responses. We found that aging augments cardiac ER stress. MAM are uniquely positioned to sustain damage from both MITO and ER. The increased ROS from aged heart MITO may damage CL in the MAM and activate ER stress. We will evaluate the role of primary MITO dysfunction at baseline and then following ISC and early REP to MAM damage and CL modification in Aim 1. The role of ETC inhibition to protect MAM during ISC-REP is studied (Aim 1).  The response of MAM and ER to ISC-REP in the aged heart is unknown (Aim 2). Acute, transient complex I blockade with a reversible inhibitor decreases injury in aged hearts. We found that metformin inhibits complex I in a dose-dependent manner, especially in ISC-damaged heart MITO. Next, we showed that metformin treatment only at REP in doses that inhibit complex I decreases infarct size in vivo following 24 hrs. REP. We hypothesize that modulation of complex I at REP in aged hearts will attenuate damage to the MAM with a subsequent decrease in ER stress that, in turn, minimizes the generation of dysfunctional MITO and cardiac injury. The partial inhibition of complex I is studied as a new upstream therapeutic intervention to attenuate cardiac injury and minimize post-infarction heart failure development in aged hearts (Aim 3)."

"9378387","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):          Alcohol-related health problems are the worldwide health concern. More than 50% of Veterans use alcohol and nearly 23% are binge or heavy drinkers. Pathogenesis of alcoholic liver disease (ALD) involves endotoxemia caused by gut barrier dysfunction. About 25% of alcoholics develop ALD, but the factors that make them susceptible to ALD remain to be determined. The relationship between stress and alcoholism is well known, so this project focuses on the effects of stress on alcoholic tissue injury. Our preliminary studies showed that different types of stress  disrupt tight junctions (TJs) and increase permeability in the intestinal epithelium by a mechanism that involves intracellular signaling elements. Preliminary data also indicated that chronic restraint stress exacerbates alcohol-induced gut permeability and associated liver injury. Probiotics are well known to promote gastrointestinal cell survival and barrier function. Our preliminary data indicated that Lactobacillus casei (L. casei) ameliorates stress and ethanol-induced gut barrier dysfunction. On the basis of these results it is hypothesized that: a) stress-induced cell signaling promotes alcohol-induced TJ disruption and barrier dysfunction in the intestinal epithelium, b) chronic stress exacerbates ethanol-induced gut barrier dysfunction, endotoxemia and liver injury by a CaV1.3 channel and JNK2-dependent mechanism, and c) L. casei ameliorates stress and ethanol-induced gut barrier dysfunction, endotoxemia and liver injury. Using a cell culture model of the intestinal epithelium and gene knock out mice we will determine that: 1) Ca2+-induced mitochondrial oxidative stress mediates stress-induced activation of Ask1/MKK7/JNK2/c-Src signaling and TJ disruption in the intestinal epithelium, 2) Glucocorticoids mediate stress-induced cell signaling in the intestinal epithelium and exacerbation of alcoholic gut permeability, 3) Stress-activated signaling promotes acetaldehyde-induced TJ disruption, 4) CaV1.3 channel and [Ca2+]i mediate the synergistic effects of chronic stress and ethanol on gut and liver, 5) Down regulation of JNK2 blocks stress and alcohol-induced gut barrier dysfunction and liver injury, 6) L. casei prevents stress-induced cell signalin and attenuates acetaldehyde-induced TJ disruption in Caco-2 cells and mouse intestine ex vivo, 7) L. casei attenuates stress and ethanol- induced gut permeability and liver injury in vivo, and 8) Peptide-like factor released by L. casei blocks gut barrier dysfunction and prevents liver injur caused by stress and ethanol. The outcome of these studies will have direct impact on the fields of stress-induced alteration of intestinal mucosal homeostasis as well as pathogenesis of alcoholic liver disease.  ."
"9378374","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):           Project Summary Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) is the common cause of kidney failure. Elucidating mechanisms that mediate the early stage of DKD may help to identify novel preventive and therapeutic measures for patients with DKD. In the previous funding period, we demonstrated a critical role of NF-?B and STAT3 acetylation in DKD through the regulation of inflammatory gene expression (see progress report). To further understand the mechanism of early DKD injury, we performed proteomic studies in the glomeruli of streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rats and identified protein S (PS) as one of the proteins which were highly regulated in early DKD. PS, coded by Pros1, is a cofactor for the formation of activated protein C (APC). APC formation has been shown to protect glomerular cells from apoptosis in DKD. In addition, PS shares structural similarities with GAS6, which is known to be involved in the pathogenesis of kidney disease. Both PS and GAS6 bind to TAM receptors (Tyro3, Axl, and Mer), which belong to a family of receptor tyrosine kinases that mediates regulation of inflammation as well as cell survival and migration. However, PS and GAS6 have different binding affinity to individual TAM receptors and appear to have different functions. The role of PS and TAM receptors in kidney disease is not known. Our preliminary data suggest that PS expression increased in the glomeruli of diabetic rats and in human kidneys with early DKD, but decreased in those with advanced DKD. Plasma concentrations of PS were not different between diabetic and non-diabetic rats or humans, suggesting a local regulation of PS expression. We found that knockdown of PS in podocytes enhanced high glucose-induced apoptosis while overexpression of PS inhibited TNF-?-induced pro-inflammatory gene expression, suggesting a protective role of PS against diabetes-induced podocyte injury. We found that Tyro3, one of the TMA receptors, was upregulated by high glucose and knockdown of Tyro3 expression abolished the protective effects of PS in podocytes. Tyro3 expression is also upregulated in human glomeruli at early DKD but downregulated at late DKD. We developed podocyte-specific Pros1 knockout mice (KO) and found that diabetic KO mice developed more proteinuria, mesangial expansion, and foot process effacement than diabetic wild-type mice. Based on these findings, we hypothesize that PS may protect glomerular cell injury in early DKD through the formation of APC and/or effects mediated by Tyro3. We will test our hypothesis by two aims: In the aim 1, we will determine the factors which upregulate PS and Tyro3 at early DKD and those suppress PS and Tyro3 at late DKD and the effects of PS and Tyro3 in podocytes cultured in diabetic condition. In the aim 2 we will determine the role of PS and Tyro3 in DKD progression in vivo using both conditional overexpression and knockout mouse models for PS and Tyro3. We believe that the proposed studies could help us to elucidate the mechanism of glomerular cell injury in early DKD and therefore we could develop more effective drugs to prevent the progression of DKD."
"9486836","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Depression is consistently one of the top causes of morbidity and mortality, and veterans are afflicted more commonly than non-veterans. In addition, veterans are more than twice as likely to die from depression- related suicide than the general population. Despite current antidepressant medications, a disappointingly large number of patients are refractory to current treatments, all of which target similar mechanisms. Thus, new medications with novel mechanisms of action are urgently needed. Using animal models that can predict antidepressant and anti-anxiety effects in humans, we identified a novel molecule in depression and anxiety- related behaviors, the acid-sensing ion channel 1a (ASIC1A). Pharmacologically inhibiting and genetically disrupting ASIC1A in mice produced antidepressant-like effects in the forced swim test, tail suspension test, and following chronic unpredictable stress. Moreover, the effects were independent of and additive to several currently used antidepressant medications. Disrupting ASIC1A also reduced conditioned and unconditioned fear behaviors, which model post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and other anxiety disorders. Together these findings suggest the exciting possibility that targeting ASIC1A will relieve depression and anxiety through a novel mechanism of action. To take full advantage of this possibility we need to know more about how ASIC1A is activated in the brain. The exquisite sensitivity of ASIC1A to low extracellular pH suggests that acidic pH might play an important signaling role. Supporting this possibility, we recently identified a novel current during synaptic transmission in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) that depended on ASIC1A and ASIC2, and was inhibited by the ASIC antagonists amiloride and psalmotoxin. Furthermore, inhibiting or genetically deleting carbonic anhydrase 4 (CA4), a key pH-buffering enzyme in the brain, increased this novel ASIC- dependent synaptic current. Finally, loss of ASIC1A and the associated current was accompanied by significant structural and functional changes at glutamatergic synapses, which we suspect may underlie the behavioral consequences of ASIC disruption. Based on these observations we hypothesize that ASICs and CA4 play key roles in depression-related synaptic physiology in the NAc and depression-related behavior. To test this hypothesis we propose to answer the following questions: 1) Do ASIC1A and ASIC2 contribute to synaptic and behavioral responses to chronic stress? 2) Does carbonic anhydrase 4 contribute to synaptic plasticity in the NAc and depression-related behavior? And, 3) can inhibiting or deleting ASIC1A reverse effects of chronic stress on depression-related behavior, and is the NAc a key site of ASIC1A action? The answers to these questions will provide important steps towards our long-term goals of better understanding the role of ASICs in brain function and behavior and learning to target these processes for therapeutic purposes."
"9521234","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There is no cure for Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Five million people nationwide are suffering from AD and this number will grow to 20 million as the baby boomer generation continues to age. Even with current clinical and pathological knowledge about AD, the exact causes and factors that take place with disease progression are not fully understood. Interestingly, the liver generates toxic amyloid-? peptides that travel acros the blood brain barrier. Decreasing the liver's production of these peptides with drugs decreases brain amyloid-beta peptide levels in mice. Questions remain concerning how changes in the liver and other organs outside the central nervous system (CNS) influence onset, progression, and treatment of AD. Our laboratory has already shown that lipid and energy metabolism as well as oxidative stress pathways are altered in liver and peripheral T-cells in advanced stages of an AD mouse model. These changes may be connected to similar dyshomeostasis of these pathways that are well known to occur in the CNS. In order to gain a better understanding of AD, it is necessary to study changes outside of the CNS and fully understand how they relate to CNS. The PI's long-term objectives are to provide better information about molecular changes that initiate disease onset in AD and use this information to help facilitate new avenues for AD therapeutics. Quantitative proteomics is a powerful tool to apply to this problem because it tells us about changes in specific cellular functions. However, it is currently not possible to multiplex to the degree necessary for answering questions about the role of peripheral organs in AD. Here, we propose three aims to address this issue: Aim 1. Develop multiplexing capabilities to measure relative protein expression quantitatively in an unprecedented 60 tissue samples. Aim 2. Create selective multiplexing proteomics for post-translational modification of cysteine- containing proteins to understand the impact of oxidative stress on proteins in tissue. Aim 3. Elucidate AD pathogenesis in peripheral tissues for the first time to multiple peripheral organs (liver, heart, kidney, lung, and brain) from AD mice and age/sex-matched controls at ages before and after the onset of disease symptoms. These proteomics measurements will establish how altered metabolic- and oxidative-stress pathways in the periphery relate to changes in the CNS. Furthermore, the timing of these changes with disease onset and progression will be established. Successful completion of these aims will help to delineate how peripheral organs contribute to AD pathology and help facilitate new avenues for AD therapeutics. This outcome is necessary to further the mission of the NIH to conduct research in the causes, diagnosis, prevention, and cure of human diseases."
"9487903","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         The overall goal of this line of research is to gain a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms that determine successful nerve regeneration in the peripheral nervous system; this is a high priority research area for the VA healthcare mission. Following injury to a peripheral nerve the denervated distal nerve segment undergoes remarkable changes including loss of the blood-nerve barrier, Schwann cell proliferation, macrophage invasion, and the production of numerous cytokines and neurotrophic factors. The aggregate consequence of these changes is that the denervated nerve becomes a permissive and even preferred target for regenerating axons from the proximal nerve segment. However, it often surprises people that although peripheral nerves display robust axonal regeneration, only approximately 10% of adults will recover normal nerve function using state-of-the-art repair techniques. This success rate has not markedly improved since the introduction of enhanced microsurgical techniques utilizing modern surgical microscopes several decades ago. Clearly there is a need for new ideas and approaches to this problem in order to improve these outcome statistics.  Previous work from several laboratories, including our own, has shown that earlier reinnervation of an end-organ target such as muscle results in a greater overall level of functional recovery. Thus a major key to improving functional recovery will be to decrease the amount of time that distal end-organ targets such as muscle remain denervated. Another factor that will improve functional recovery following nerve repair will be to increase the extent of accurate reinnervation of origina end-organ targets. The possible role that the denervated end-organ target itself (e.g. muscle) may play in these phenomena during the regeneration period is largely unexplored. The work proposed in this application will begin to address this question using model systems in the mouse to assess both the extent and accuracy of motor neuron regeneration at the level of the terminal nerve branch.  Exosomes (nanometer sized extracellular vesicles) are secreted by just about every cell type that has been examined, and it has recently been discovered that they become a protected environment for various forms of RNA and proteins and thus can function as novel long-distance messengers. Our working hypothesis is that muscle, as an end-organ, elaborates signals that travel within the denervated nerve and that these signals influence the speed and accuracy of regenerating axons. We further suggest that exosomes produced by muscle may be one such mechanism by which such signals travel within the denervated nerve. In support of this hypothesis we present in vivo data that demonstrates that the accuracy of regenerating motor neurons is dependent upon the denervated distal nerve segment remaining in uninterrupted continuity with muscle. We also present preliminary data that exosomes harvested from a muscle cell line and applied to a denervated nerve in vivo results in significantly greater and faster axonal regeneration in two different regeneration models. The experiments proposed in this application could provide a paradigm-shift in our approach to peripheral nerve repair by focusing on the role of exosomes produced by target end-organs. This innovative idea is a significant addition to existing interventions that directly target the motor neuron itself, and seeks to impact clinical and research attention by highlighting the distal denervated nerve as a general delivery device for novel therapeutics."
"9486873","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):           Combat-related mild Traumatic brain injury (mTBI) is a leading cause of sustained physical, cognitive, emotional, and behavioral deficits in military service members, OEF/OIF/OND veterans, and generals public. Recent studies have also showed that mTBI substantially increases the risk of developing post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). However, the pathophysiology of mTBI is not completely understood and its long-term effects are controversial. Furthermore, the neuronal mechanisms for mTBI potentiating the likelihood of PTSD development are even less clear. A significant factor has been that conventional neuroimaging techniques such as MRI and CT have limited sensitivity in detecting physiological abnormalities caused by mTBI or PTSD, or predicting long-term cognitive and behavioral outcomes. CT and MRI are generally negative even in mTBI or PTSD patients who experience persistent post-concussive symptoms (PCS) and/or PTSD symptoms. A main goal of this application is to develop and validate a voxel-wise resting-state magnetoencephalography (rs-MEG) source imaging technique that will identify abnormalities and assist in the diagnosis of mTBI patients with and without PTSD on a single-subject basis. We will also apply rs-MEG source imaging to examine the abnormality in PTSD neurocircuitry in different frequency bands, and to use rs-MEG to investigate the neuroimaging basis of mTBI's potentiation of PTSD. We will study four groups of veterans (N=50 per group): 1) veterans diagnosed with mTBI without PTSD (mTBI-only group); 2) veterans diagnosed with PTSD without mTBI (PTSD-only group); 3) veterans diagnosed with comorbid mTBI and PTSD; 4) healthy control (HC) veterans. Specific Aim 1 will develop and validate a single-subject based, voxel-wise, MEG slow-wave (delta-band, 1-4 Hz) source imaging approach for assisting in mTBI diagnosis by detecting neuronal abnormalities not visible with conventional MRI/CT. We will establish a voxel-wise normative database for the rs-MEG slow-wave imaging approach using data from HC veterans, and assess specificity by cross-validating MEG data in a sample of HCs that are not part of the database. A non-parametric method based on bootstrapping will be studied to expand our analysis to voxels that fail to meet the required Gaussian distribution. We will then examine the positive detection rate (i.e., sensitivity) and test-retest-reliability of the MEG slow-wave source  imaging approach for detecting injuries in veterans from mTBI-only and comorbid mTBI-PTSD groups. The spatial distribution of the abnormal MEG slow-wave generation will also be studied at the group level to identify the brain areas that are particularly vulnerable to mTBI. Specific Aim 2 will use rs-MEG source imaging to examine abnormalities in PTSD-based neurocircuitry and to investigate the neural basis of mTBI's potentiation of PTSD development. In PTSD-only and comorbid groups, we will examine whether a model of PTSD associated with dysfunction in emotion processing neurocircuitry (i.e., amygdala, ventro-medial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), and hippocampus), can account for abnormalities detected by electromagnetic-based rs-MEG source imaging techniques for different frequency bands. We will also study the relationship between abnormal MEG signals in high-frequency bands from PTSD neurocircuitry and co-existing abnormal MEG slow-wave generation due to mTBI. Specific Aim 3 will use voxel-wise MEG source imaging to examine the neurophysiological basis of clinical symptoms and cognitive impairments in veterans with mTBI and/or PTSD. The success of this project will significantly improve neuroimaging-based techniques for efficient diagnosis of mTBI, and advance the understanding of the relationships among neurobiological, neuropsychological, and neuropsychiatric effects of mTBI, which are the foci of this Request for Applications."
"9378392","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):          Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) and Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) are common neurodegenerative disorders that disproportionately affect aging veterans. These disorders are progressive, fatal, and without effective treatment. Recently, the most common known cause of ALS and FTD was identified as an intronic GGGGCC hexanucleotide repeat expansion in the gene C9orf72 (C9FTD/ALS). This repeat triggers synthesis of toxic proteins via a process known as Repeat Associated Non-AUG (RAN) Translation. These RAN peptides kill neurons and sufficient to cause neurodegeneration in model systems. We know very little about how RAN translation at C9 repeats (C9 RAN) actually occurs. The objective of this proposal is to determine the mechanisms underlying C9 RAN and to identify methods of blocking it as a first step towards novel therapeutic development. Our central hypothesis is that C9 RAN utilizes a non-canonical translational initiation pathway that can be selectively blocked. Moreover, we predict that preventing C9 RAN will stop neurodegeneration elicited by GGGGCC repeats. To test these hypotheses, we developed a robust and quantitative in vitro assay of C9 RAN, as well as a collection of models derived from patient induced pluripotent stem cells, rodent neurons, and Drosophila. Using these tools, we will define the mRNA species that undergo C9 RAN, identify the critical RNA and protein based factors that allow for C9 RAN, develop a small molecule screen to identify selective C9 RAN translation inhibitors, and test whether blocking RAN precludes toxicity in model systems. Together, these studies should provide us with a working map of how C9 RAN occurs and what steps can be taken to prevent it. This project has broad reaching implications both for our understanding of how RAN translation contributes to disease as well as providing a logical path towards therapeutic development in C9FTD/ALS and other neurodegenerative nucleotide repeat disorders that affect veterans."
"9378701","Insomnia and disturbed sleep are common symptoms in mood and anxiety disorders. Depression and PTSD are associated with dysfunction of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. Brain levels of corticotrophin-releasing factor (CRF), a critical neuropeptide regulator of the HPA axis, are chronically elevated in these disorders. CRF has well characterized wake-promoting/sleep-disruptive effects. Previous work from our laboratory and others has identified GABAergic neurons in the preoptic hypothalamus as critical regulators of sleep onset, sleep maintenance and sleep homeostasis. During the previous funding period, we demonstrated that acute elevations of CRF has sleep disruptive effects mediated, in part, by actions on preoptic neurons. We provide preliminary data that the disruption of sleep homeostasis that accompanies chronic partial sleep restriction can be reversed by administration of CRF receptor antagonists. We hypothesize that activation of CRF neurons occurring in response to the stress of chronic sleep restriction disrupts sleep homeostasis. We further hypothesize that CRF effects on sleep homeostasis are mediated through suppression of the activity of sleep-regulatory GABAergic neurons in the preoptic hypothalamus and in the rostral medulla. We propose four specific aims to address these hypotheses. Aim 1 will determine if CRF disrupts preoptic and medullary sleep-regulatory neuronal activity during chronic sleep restriction in rats. Aim 2 will determine the nuclei of origin of CRF neuronal afferents to GABAergic sleep regulatory neurons in the preoptic hypothalamus and the rostral medulla through targeted microinjections in the hypothalamus and extended amygdala of AAV-DIO-mcherry in CRF-ires- CRE knock-in mice. Aim 3 will identify CRF neuronal populations responsible for the negative modulation of sleep homeostasis by expressing channel rhodopsin-2 and hM3Dq excitatory designer receptor in hypothalamic and extended amygdala nuclei that contain CRH neurons and determining the effects of light-induced and chemogenetic excitation of different CRF neuronal populations on sleep homeostasis. Aim 4 will determine if chemogenetic silencing of CRF neurons restores homeostatic responses to sleep loss during chronic sleep restriction. Insomnia and insufficient sleep are common in psychiatric disorders that are associated with and/or exacerbated by physiological or psychological stress. We propose to examine fundamental mechanisms and circuits that might underlie the negative impact of chronic mild stressors on the homeostatic regulation of sleep, with the goal of identifying critical regulatory nodes that can be targeted for therapy. Chronic sleep disturbance can contribute to maladaptive stress and may be a modifiable risk factor for poor psychiatric and health outcomes in PTSD, depression and other disorders."
"9378707","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Acute and chronic inflammation is a common finding in the adult prostate that has been implicated in the genesis of lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) in aging men. The strong association has generated considerable interest in prostate inflammation and its potential as a therapeutic target to prevent or treat LUTS. We and others have postulated that prostatic inflammation contributes to development of LUTS in two ways: (1) producing irritative voiding symptoms by effects on afferent nerves co-innervating the prostate and bladder and (2) producing obstructive voiding symptoms by inducing fibrosis in the prostate. We will perform a retrospective analysis of surgically treated patients who underwent detailed preoperative urodynamic evaluation to examine the association of inflammation with fibrosis. To test the hypothesis that inflammation produces irritative symptoms, we will examine the correlation of inflammation with detrusor overactivity. To test the hypothesis that fibrosis produces obstruction,  we will examine the correlation between if fibrosis and increased urethral resistance. This analysis will provide the first comprehensive assessment correlating inflammation and fibrosis and their individual associations with changes in bladder function that are the hallmark of BPH/LUTS. We will perform mechanistic studies using an established mouse model of prostatic inflammation in which we have shown that inflammation induces a significant increase in voiding frequency and prostatic fibrosis. We will determine whether increased voiding frequency is associated with detrusor overactivity due to changes in motor nerve activity and/or cholinergic sensitivity of the detrusor and the role of epigenetic regulation in the fibrotic response. We will  then examine the reversibility abnormal voiding behavior and prostate fibrosis when inflammation subsides. Three specific aims examine the hypothesis that prostatic inflammation causes urinary frequency by producing detrusor overactivity and causes bladder outlet obstruction by inducing prostatic fibrosis. Specific Aim 1. Determine the association of transition  zone inflammation and fibrosis with detrusor overactivity and increased urethral resistance in men with BPH/LUTS. Specific Aim 2. Test the hypothesis that chronic prostate inflammation induces detrusor overactivity and increased voiding frequency. Specific Aim 3. Test the hypothesis that prostatic fibrosis associated with chronic inflammation is reversible."
"9378696","The most common form of prostate cancer, adenocarcinoma, is a major healthcare problem facing Veterans. Prostate cancer is a hormonally driven disease in that it is primarily dependent on androgens for survival and propagation. Androgens provide such survival signals by interacting with androgen receptors (AR) within the prostate cancer cells. Since the testes are the primary source of androgenic steroids, the standard approach to treating advanced prostate cancer is to minimize gonadal production of androgens so as to disrupt androgen/AR signaling. Thus, androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is the mainstay of treating metastatic disease, and in conjunction with radiation, is also an integral part of treating locally advanced/high risk prostate cancer. Although initially effective, ADT is not curative, and the majority of patients with advanced prostate cancer progress on ADT within a couple of years. Patients who fail ADT are deemed to have castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Such patients may, at least initially, respond to further manipulation of the androgen/AR axis since this signaling pathway is often restored in ADT-failing patients. Hence, considerable efforts have been made to further target this pathway by developing newer generation of androgen biosynthesis and AR inhibitors. This strategy has proven to be beneficial, but again for a limited period of time. The other major treatment for advanced PC is docetaxel- based chemotherapy, which is generally used in men with progressive CRPC. Remarkably, to date, no other agent added to docetaxel has shown to provide better outcomes than single agent docetaxel, which again provides disease control for a limited period of time. Given these challenges, our goal is to use well-defined cell culture models of prostate cancer that encompass a range of disease states to study and interrogate certain ?nodes? that integrate specific components of the prostate cancer metabolome. We will target key mediators that regulate and interact with proliferative/anabolic and anti-proliferative/catabolic signals in prostate cancer cells. More specifically, we will study and define interactions between the proliferative erbB-PI3K-Akt-mediated anabolic and the anti-proliferative AMPK- mediated catabolic pathways in AR-expressing and non-AR-expressing prostate cancer cells. For these studies, we will utilize agents that are already in clinical use or in active clinical development, which will facilitate the translation of this work to the clinic if the pre-clinical studies are successful. In other studies, knock down via siRNA or shRNA of some of these key regulatory mediators will provide additional mechanistic insights into the interacting and feedback signals of the prostate cancer metabolome in treatment-sensitive and treatment-resistant prostate cancer cells. We will determine the effects of specific treatments or treatment combinations on the sensitive and resistant prostate cancer cells via metrics that assess drug-drug interactions (synergistic, additive, antagonistic), cell proliferation/growth inhibition, cell cycling and/or cell apoptosis. We will extend some of the studies to SCID-mouse based xenografts to help further define anti-tumor activity and potential treatment-related toxicities in the vivo setting. We believe these combinations of studies, taken together, will have direct clinical relevance, and may help in the development of multi-modal treatments for prostate cancer."
"9487901","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Diarrhea is a predominant symptom of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) or intestinal infections caused by food-borne pathogens. Our veteran patient population is particularly more vulnerable to diarrheal illnesses due to their age and numerous co-morbidities. In spite of significant medical advances, the treatment of diarrheal disorders still remains challenging. Therefore, it is important to understand the mechanisms involved in the pathophysiology of diarrhea associated with these diseases. Diarrhea results from increased intestinal secretion and/or decreased absorption of water and electrolytes. A major route of electrolyte absorption in the human intestine involves coupled operation of Na+/H+ (NHE) and Cl-/HCO3- exchangers. Studies have shown NHE3 to play a critical role in mediating intestinal sodium absorption as NHE3 knockout mice exhibit diarrheal phenotype. Also, it has been shown that NHE3 KO mice are more susceptible to inflammation as NHE3 deficiency in these mice resulted in diarrhea associated with colitis. To date, however, very little is known about the molecular mechanisms involved in decreasing NHE3 expression in diarrheal disorders. In order to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the down-regulation of NHE3 expression in IBD-related diarrhea, our current studies are focused on the role of epigenetic mechanisms such as DNA methylation and histone modifications shown to be implicated in the pathogenesis of IBD. Our extensive preliminary data provides strong evidence for the epigenetic regulation of NHE3 expression by changes in DNA methylation and histone modifications. Based on these data, we hypothesize that changes in DNA methylation, histone modifications and chromatin remodeling play important roles in modulating NHE3 gene expression that underlie the pathophysiology of diarrhea. The current application is, therefore, designed to investigate the regulation of NHE3 gene expression by DNA methylation and histone modifications utilizing both in vitro (Aims 1 & 2) and in vivo models (Aim 3) as follows: Aim 1. Elucidate in detail the effect of DNA methylation on NHE3 promoter activity, identify the specific CpG dinucleotide involved in the modulation of NHE3 promoter and determine the roles of DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) isoforms; Aim 2: Investigate the role of histone acetyl transferase, p300 & histone deacetylase (HDAC) isoforms in the modulation of NHE3 expression, changes in histone acetylation marks on NHE3 gene and chromatin remodeling in the stimulation of NHE3 expression; and Aim 3: Examine the regulation of NHE3 expression by epigenetic mechanisms under normal and inflammatory conditions utilizing wild type, DSS-induced colitis and NHE3 knockout mice (diarrheal phenotype). The outcome of these studies should provide novel insights into the epigenetic regulation of NHE3 and define important mechanistic link between alterations in DNA methylation/histone modifications of NHE3 gene and diarrhea associated with IBD. Also, these studies will establish for the first time the identity of a particular DNMT or HDAC isoforms involved in the dysregulation of NHE3 in diarrheal disorders."

"9568074","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Gram-negative bacterium Bordetella pertussis is a human restricted pathogen that causes severe respiratory infection and the disease known as whooping cough or pertussis. The recent rise in B. pertussis infections and the disease in the USA and other high income countries, along with waning immunity to current commercial pertussis vaccines necessitate research on understanding the pathogenic mechanisms employed by this bacterium. Our overall hypothesis is that the formation of biofilms is essential for persistent colonization of the respiratory tract and pathogenesis of B. pertussis. Control of biofilm development in the largely animal pathogen B. bronchiseptica is mediated by BpsR, a highly conserved transcriptional regulator. Additionally, BpsR dually activates or represses the expression of a large number of genes which have roles in virulence, transcriptional regulation, metabolic and other cellular processes. Nothing is known about the role of BpsR in B. pertussis. Functional studies of BpsR in B. pertussis have been hindered by the inability to construct a mutant strain lacking the bpsR gene. This suggests that bpsR is an essential gene in B. pertussis. We hypothesize that by regulating the expression of genes involved in essential metabolic pathways, pathogenesis and biofilm formation, BpsR controls the ability of B. pertussis to survive in the respiratory tract. In Specific Aim 1, we will utilize a tetracycline dependent conditional silencing system to examine its role in laboratory growth, gene expression and biofilm development. In Specific Aim 2, these studies will be extended to an intranasal mouse model of B. pertussis infection and biofilm development to identify its role in colonization of and formation of biofilms on respiratory organs."
"9487899","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Diabetes is an increasingly common disorder, recently estimated to affect 9.3% of the US population and 25.9% of individuals over 65 years of age (National Diabetes Statistics Report, June 2014). Because the VHA is a continuing system of care, all short- and long-term complications of diabetes are encountered in an expanding veteran group (Miller, 2004). Moreover, diabetes care in the VHA system is complex, since patients frequently have co-morbidities such as advancing age and post-traumatic stress disorder. Deleterious effects of diabetes on gastric function are highly prevalent and associated with considerable morbidity. However, the management of diabetic gastric complications remains unsatisfactory, despite an excellent record of adherence to accepted treatment guidelines, in part because mechanisms of gastric emptying abnormalities are so poorly understood. As a result, diagnosis of the underlying pathophysiology in individual cases is difficult, and since current treatment approaches are largely empirical rather than rationally designed, effective therapeutic options are often lacking. The study of the pathogenesis and treatment of gastric abnormalities in diabetes is complicated because: 1) symptoms may arise from either fast or slow gastric emptying; 2) gastric emptying is determined by the integrated response of independently regulated anatomic and functional regions of the stomach, so similar defects may result in either fast or slow gastric emptying depending on the region and/or cell type that is involved; and 3) different patterns of gastric motility regulate gastric emptying of solids and liquids during the digestive and inter-digestive periods; 4) finally, it is not entirely clear how best to use diabeti animal models in investigating diabetic gastroparesis. While many animal models of diabetes are available, it is unknown which of them most closely represents the features of human disease. Gastric emptying is regulated by distinct activities in gastric fundus, corpus/antrum and pylorus. Fast gastric emptying most often results from loss of inhibitory neurotransmission in the fundus, which is composed of tonic muscle and serves to store and accommodate ingested food by relaxing under the influence of inhibitory nerves. Slow gastric emptying often results from defective propulsive activity in the corpus/pylorus or defective relaxation of the pylorus. Defects in smooth muscle, interstitial cells of Cajal (ICC) and neuromuscular neurotransmission have all been described in the stomach of diabetic animals, with loss of ICC and impaired nitrergic and cholinergic neurotransmission being the most consistent findings. However, we find that purinergic neurotransmission is also lost, suggesting that both vesicular and non-vesicular neurotransmission are impaired. The purpose of this proposal is to investigate the pathogenesis of diabetes-associated changes in gastric emptying. In Aim 1, we will investigate the spectrum of neurotransmission deficits in different stomach regions of diabetic mice with predefined fast and slow gastric emptying. These studies will be performed in different animal models of diabetes to determine the degree to which these models share a common pathophysiology. These studies will define the pathogenesis of fast and slow gastric emptying, and generate reliable, reproducible data in disordered diabetic stomach. In Aim 2, we will systematically examine the hypothesis that dysfunction of the intracellular cargo motor, myosin 5a (myo5a), is an important cause of neurotransmitter deficit in diabetic stomach. This hypothesis is based on our studies showing myo5a dysfunction results in impaired release of multiple neurotransmitters. Aim 3 will test the hypothesis that hyperglycemia leads to elevated myo5a O-GlcNAcylation, suppressing its activity and inhibiting neurotransmission, as well as enabling its premature degradation. Elucidation of the pathway involved in suppression of enteric neurotransmission may identify novel targets of therapy for diabetic stomach."
"9591942","Project Summary/Abstract This R03 proposal is complementary to PI?s K01-award in which metabolic consequences for the lack of skeletal muscle phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) synthesis are being investigated. While the K01 proposal elucidates the role of skeletal muscle PE synthesis that occurs at endo/sarcoplasmic reticulum, the focus of this R03 application is on skeletal muscle mitochondrial PE synthesis that is mediated by an enzyme phosphatidylserine decarboxylase (PSD). Low aerobic capacity is the strongest predictor for all-cause mortality. Skeletal muscle mitochondria are the largest contributors for aerobic metabolism, whose mass exhibits tremendous plasticity in response to exercise training. While molecular mechanisms that mediate syntheses of mitochondrial proteins are well-described, there are no reports that describe how exercise may induce syntheses of mitochondrial structural lipids in skeletal muscle. Our preliminary experiments showed that exercise training induced an increase in skeletal muscle PSD, and its absence in vitro resulted in reduced aerobic capacity that was likely attributable to a reduction in mitochondrial complex II activity. To examine the role of muscle mitochondrial PE synthesis in vivo, mice with skeletal muscle-specific knockout of PSD (PSD- MKO) were generated. In this proposal, we will test the hypothesis that skeletal muscle mitochondria PE synthesis is essential for complex II activity, whose absence results in mice that have low exercise capacity that are more prone to developing metabolic diseases. Data from these studies will provide insights into the role that mitochondrial phospholipid biosynthesis has on skeletal muscle respiratory capacity and whole-body metabolic health."
"9432924","Abstract  Yersinia pestis is the causative agent of plague and has caused widespread loss of human life during three pandemics. Y. pestis is also firmly established in animal reservoirs on nearly every inhabited continent, with the largest reservoir in the southwestern United States. Each year multiple outbreaks occur resulting in 1,000- 5,000 human cases reported worldwide (likely an underestimate). Currently there is not a FDA approved vaccine for plague and the bacterium has a high potential for bioterrorism misuse. Consequently, Y. pestis is considered a Tier 1 Select Agent. In order to grow, Y. pestis must acquire essential biometals such as Fe, Mn and Zn. However, the host restricts access to these metals through nutritional immunity. Therefore, Y. pestis, like other pathogens, has evolved high affinity metal acquisition systems that are essential for virulence. We recently discovered that the yersiniabactin (Ybt) synthetase system not only contributes to Fe acquisition, but also to Zn acquisition in Y. pestis. Furthermore, we have shown that the inner membrane permease YbtX (which is not required for Fe-Ybt acquisition) is required for Ybt synthetase-dependent Zn acquisition. These discoveries have opened a new area in Ybt and Zn acquisition research. Specifically, we hypothesize that Y. pestis produces a Ybt synthetase-dependent zincophore that is distinct from the Ybt siderophore. Furthermore, Y. pestis uses a dedicated uptake system to reacquire this zincophore once bound to Zn. Along with ZnuABC, this new system is essential for Zn acquisition during infection. In Specific Aim 1, we will use a biochemical approach to purify and define the chemical structure and Zn affinity of the secreted Ybt synthetase-dependent zincophore. In Specific Aim 2, we will determine the contribution of the Ybt synthetase-dependent zincophore to virulence using a hemochromatosis mouse model. Importantly, the hemochromatosis mouse is defective in Fe nutritional immunity. Thus, this model will allow us to separate contributions of Ybt synthetase-dependent Fe acquisition from Ybt synthetase-dependent Zn acquisition to Y. pestis virulence. Finally, as Y. pestis also infects fleas for transmission, we will determine the contribution of Zn acquisition to colonization and survival in the flea vector. Completion of these aims will provide a comprehensive understanding of the role of Zn acquisition in Y. pestis virulence. Furthermore, as Ybt is a conserved virulence factor, this work will also be relevant to other bacterial pathogens that use the Ybt system."
"9547622","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Pyelonephritis continues to result in considerable morbidity, mortality and health care expense. In order to develop new treatment strategies as well as understand who is at risk for pyelonephritis, a better understanding of the kidney's role i the innate defense of the kidney and urinary tract is needed. Our research has identified a murine model of intercalated cell deficiency that is susceptible to pyelonephritis. We have also demonstrated that in mice and humans intercalated cells are involved in production and secretion of antimicrobial peptides. Others have demonstrated that intercalated cells act as the first site in the kidney that responds to Gram-negative organisms via Toll-like 4 receptor (TLR4) signaling pathways. Thus, surmounting evidence suggests that intercalated cells play a critical role in the innate defense of the kidney. We hypothesize that key kidney acid-base mediators are required for renal innate immune function. To build on our previous studies, we have devised three specific aims that will thematically examine the role of intercalated cells in innate defense of the kidney. In Specific Aim 1, we will correlate human antimicrobial production with carbonic anhydrase inhibition to our carbonic anhydrase murine models. Next, we will dissect the role of renal carbonic anhydrase in our mouse model of congenital intercalate cell deficiency by performing kidney transplants. In Specific Aim 2, the antimicrobial response that is TLR4 dependent and independent will be elucidated using an intercalated cell-specific TLR4 conditional knockout approach. Finally, in Aim 3, we have developed a murine model acquired loss of intercalated cells using a diphtheria toxin murine model. These Aims, while interconnected, will adequately and independently test the hypothesis presented in this application. Our long-term research goal is to develop new pyelonephritis treatment strategies that reduce antibiotic exposure and preserve renal function in populations at risk. The proposed research will provide the foundation to include modulation of acid-base mediators in pyelonephritis management, thereby expanding treatment scope beyond antibiotics."
"9378706","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):          Alzheimer disease (AD) produces a progressive degeneration of the brain that slowly destroys a victim's cognitive abilities. This disease inflicts tremendous social and economic burden on families and society in general. It is projected that more than 200,000 Veterans will be diagnosed with dementia in 2017, with AD the most common cause. Therapeutic options for AD remain very limited and no treatments have been shown to slow the relentless progression of the disease. Pathologically AD is characterized by the presence of extracellular amyloid plaques composed of amyloid-? (A?) derived from amyloid precursor protein (APP) and the abnormal phosphorylation of the microtubule associated protein tau that results in the formation of tangles inside neurons. These protein deposits are associated with a dramatic loss of neurons in the cortex and hippocampus. The mechanistic relationship between these protein accumulations and neurodegeneration is, however, unknown. Synaptic dysfunction and loss of axon terminals are among the earliest recognized changes in AD, suggesting that impairment of mechanisms that maintain integrity of synapses may underlie or contribute to pathology. Removal and replacement of damaged proteins (proteostasis) is a primary mechanism by which cells maintain functional structures such as mitochondria. Clearance is mediated by two interconnected systems-the ubitquitin-proteasome system and the autophagy-lysosome system. Interestingly, recent studies indicate that there may be locally regulated proteostasis programs at presynaptic terminals. In our preliminary data we demonstrate that the autophagy-lysosome system is upregulated specifically at synapses in response to A?. In this Pilot Project we propose to test the hypothesis that presynaptic autophagy plays a crucial role in the neurodegeneration that occurs in AD. To test the hypothesis, we have generated two presynaptically targeted molecular regulators of autophagy - one enhancer and one suppressor. We propose to determine the consequences of altering presynaptic autophagy on an in vitro model of AD as well as a murine model of the disease. At the end of the proposed studies we expect to have a better understanding of autophagy of presynaptic structures and how this process relates to neurodegeneration in AD. This knowledge will hopefully help us to identify novel targets for the treatments that slow the progress of this devastating disease."
"9378729","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):          The incretin glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) has been a major focus of diabetes research and drug development for the past 20 years. The incretin system is essential for normal glucose homeostasis and recent evidence indicates that there is specific dysfunction of this system in type 2 diabetes (T2DM). While initially proposed to act as a hormone, secreted into the circulation from enteroendocrine cells, recent work has raised questions as to whether this is an important mechanism of endogenous GLP-1 action. In fact, GLP-1 circulates at low levels and is rapidly inactivated by specific enzymatic metabolism. Emerging information suggests that blood borne GLP-1 may not account for many of its actions. We have recently observed an important effect of GLP-1 receptor activity in the fasting state when plasma levels are very low and unchanging. These studies, in mice and humans, suggest a role for ?-cell GLP-1 to regulate insulin secretion as a paracrine factor. This is currently an underdeveloped area of research, but has the potential to dramatically change the understanding of the incretin effect and physiology of GLP-1. Given that there is already a solid base of therapeutics based on GLP-1, new mechanistic understanding could be rapidly translated into clinical application. This proposal will  take up the issue of fasting/paracrine GLP-1 action by addressing the following specific aims: 1. Determine the roles of fasting GLP-1 concentrations and alpha-cell secretion on insulin release; 2. Determine the role of basal GLP-1 action on the ?-cell response to insulin resistance; 3. Determine the role of basal GLP-1 action on fasting glucose regulation in lean, obese, prediabetic, and diabetic subjects. Each of these aims will be conducted in selected groups of human subjects.  The studies proposed herein will use methods of human investigation that we have developed or refined in recent years and take advantage of INDs issued to our group by the FDA to use synthetic GLP-1 and a GLP-1r agonist, exendin-(9-39), in human research. At the conclusion of this project we will have a much clearer picture of how GLP-1 regulates ?-cell function, and the role of fasting GLP-1r signaling and islet paracrine action in this process. A critical aspect of this project is the examination of ?-cell secretion of GLP-1 as central in the  regulation of fasting insulin secretion. In addition, the results of the experiments proposed herei will examine a novel role for GLP-1 in the compensation for abnormal glucose metabolism. We will connect the findings from studies of healthy subjects made insulin resistant with parallel measures in diabetic and prediabetic subjects. These related hypotheses are driven by the goal of optimizing the GLP-1 system as a means of improving metabolic control. Overall, the outcomes of this project will be beneficial to the broad swath of diabetic patients currently needing better treatment, both inside and outside the VA system."
"9454042","Project Summary Dopamine (DA) is a powerful neuromodulator that facilitates memory formation and underlies reward-related behaviors by regulating synaptic plasticity. Microdialysis and voltammetry are commonly used to measure extracellular concentrations of neuromodulators in vivo, but these techniques suffer from poor temporal resolution and neurotransmitter specificity, respectively. Quantifying DA release alone provides limited information as DA can exert various effects on synaptic plasticity depending on the timing of release, concentration of DA released, and the receptor subtypes that are activated. Most studies define the DA receptor subtypes that mediate plasticity by pharmacological isolation, but this approach suffers from lack of specificity, widely perturbs DA signaling, and can produce off target effects. Therefore, a tool to assess DA signaling in vivo with high spatiotemporal resolution and receptor subtype specificity will provide great insight into the cellular mechanisms by which DA modulates plasticity with cell-type specificity in behaving animals. I propose to create biosensors to visualize the dynamic activity of distinct DA receptors in cells, brain slices, and in vivo with high spatiotemporal resolution using 2-photon fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (2pFLIM). In Aims 1 and 2, I will engineer FRET-based sensors for each DA receptor subtype by screening and validating constructs first in cell lines and then in brain slices. In Aim 3, I will employ these sensors to determine how activity patterns of DA receptor subtypes influence long-term structural plasticity of dendritic spines in cortex during motor learning. We predict that activation of different DA receptor subtypes will exert distinct effects on the stability of newly formed spines following learning."
"9470497","Obesity is a critical global epidemic, a leading cause of preventable death, and a source of skyrocketing health care costs. Currently more than two thirds of US adults are overweight and at least one third are considered obese. It is increasingly appreciated that obesity is linked to chronic, low-grade inflammation in visceral adipose tissue and an associated spectrum of metabolic abnormalities including insulin resistance, fatty liver disease, and type-2 diabetes (T2D) in addition to related conditions such as heart disease, asthma, cancer, and stroke. To help control this epidemic, it will be critical to understand the specific roles of key immune cells which regulate or exacerbate inflammation and metabolic disease in obese patients.  While many of the B cells resident in lean adipose tissue are IL-10-producing B regulatory cells (Breg), B cell numbers increase in adipose tissue of obese mice and may play a role in the chronic inflammation characteristic of obese visceral adipose tissue (VAT). Combined alterations in B cell antigen presentation, cytokine profile, and antibody repertoire during obesity in mice and T2D in humans likely contributes to metabolic disease by supporting T cell mediated-inflammation and insulin resistance; however, the cause of VAT B cell dysregulation during obesity or T2D remains unknown. iNKT cells also make up 10-20% of T cells in healthy adipose tissue but this proportion is reduced in obese mice and humans. Activation of the remaining iNKT cells by the glycolipid agonist, ?Galactosylceramide (?GalCer), reduces many of the inflammatory symptoms of obesity, suggesting their loss is another important contributor to the dysregulated immune environment evident during obesity or related autoimmune or inflammatory diseases.  We have shown that ?GalCer-activated murine iNKT cells directly interact with splenic B cells to produce antigen-specific IgG and expand IL-10+ Breg cells. Interestingly, we also see that activated iNKT cells can mediate a similar increase in IL-10+ Breg cells in VAT, suggesting they play a key role in maintaining adipose homeostasis. In a related murine model of chronic inflammation, we find that iNKT cells can also be licensed by neutrophils to regulate autoreactive B cells in spleen, but the influence of neutrophils on iNKT cells and their downstream effects on B cells in adipose tissue remains as yet uncharacterized. We hypothesize that an early neutrophil influx educates iNKT cells in adipose tissue of obese mice to drive a pathogenic shift from Breg to B effector cells. iNKT cell activation may also reduce metabolic disease during obesity in part by re-establishing a healthy regulatory B cell population. These studies will enhance our understanding of key regulatory immune cell populations in healthy and chronically inflamed obese adipose tissue with implications for many other inflammatory diseases and related conditions such as T2D, cancer, and stroke."
"9487864","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Traumatic injuries of the nervous system, such as traumatic brain injury (TBI), spinal cord injury (SCI) and traumatic optic neuropathy (TON), are major causes of death and disability in the USA and major challenges for the healthcare of veterans. In addition to the primary injury, secondary injuries, which occur after the primary injury dramatically worsens the damage and cause about 40% of TBI deaths. Because little can be done to reverse the primary injury, the primary aim of the treatment is to prevent secondary injury induced neuronal death. One of the major secondary injuries of TBI, SCI and TON is glutamate excitotoxicity, the pathological process by which neurons are damaged and eventually killed by excessive stimulation of glutamate receptors. Therefore, effectively minimizing or preventing glutamate excitotoxicity will reduce the secondary injury to neurons. In addition, glutamate excitotoxicity also plays critical roles in many other neurodegenerative diseases, such as glaucoma, the leading cause of blindness in the world, including veteran population. Both TON and glaucoma specifically injure retinal ganglion cells (RGCs). Because RGCs are the only cells relaying the visual signals from the eyes to the brain, loss of RGCs will result in an irreversible loss of vision and no effective treatments are currently available. Therefore, preventing RGCs from death in TON and glaucoma is crucial to preserve vision. Understanding the mechanisms which control the vulnerability of RGCs to glutamate excitotoxicity, TON or glaucoma will help us to develop treatment strategies to prevent RGC death in these diseases. Recent studies have shown that immune molecules play important roles in neuron repair and cell death in CNS diseases. In the retina, the receptors of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules, T-cell receptor, (TCR) and their associated proteins are expressed by RGCs. Mutation of these molecules compromised RGC dendrite and axon structure and increased the vulnerability of RGCs to glutamate excitotoxicity while up-regulated MHCI expression in motor neurons significantly promoted the recovery of locomotor abilities after SCI. These findings strongly support the possibility that MHCI/TCR could protect RGCs from death. In this study, we plan to characterize the vulnerability of RGCs to glutamate excitotoxicity and optic nerve crush (ONC), investigate the roles of TCR in the regulation of RGC vulnerability, and determine the therapeutic potential of activation of TCR for the prevention of RGC death. The first goal of this study is to determine the contribution of a key molecule of TCR, CD3?, to the vulnerability of RGCs. Our preliminary results showed that different subtypes of RGCs have different vulnerability to glutamate excitotoxicity and RGC vulnerability to glutamate excitotoxicity is dramatically increased in CD3?-/- mice. We will further characterize the vulnerability of four subtypes of RGCs to glutamate excitotoxicity and ONC, and the contribution of CD3??to RGC vulnerability. The second goal is to determine the therapeutic potential of overexpressing CD3? to protect RGCs. Our preliminary results demonstrated that expressing CD3? in RGCs of CD3?-/- retinas restored the RGC dendritic defects, suggesting the reversibility of CD3?-mediated effects on RGCs. We plan to further determine whether the resistance of RGCs can be enhanced by over-expressing the gene encoding CD3?. The third goal of this study is to determine the therapeutic potentials of CD3? activating molecules to protect RGCs. It has been demonstrated that CD3? could be activated by exogenous CD3? activating molecules in vitro. We will further determine if the exogenous CD3??activating molecules work synergistically with the over-expression of CD3? to protect RGCs. Overall, this study will identify the role of MHCI-TCR in the regulation of the vulnerability of RGCs to pathological insults, and test the potential of using    MHCI/TCR mediated mechanisms to protect RGCs from death in diseases. Although RGCs are used as a model in this study, the results could provide important insights into the neuronal death of other areas of CNS and, therefore, have important implications in neuronal protection following traumatic injuries in the CNS."
"9378395","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):          White matter (WM) injury, characterized by demyelination and loss of axonal integrity, is an important cause of long-term sensorimotor and cognitive deficits after traumatic brain injury (TBI). A persistent pro-inflammatory microenvironment after TBI is considered one underlying mechanism that hinders oligodendrocyte precursor cell (OPCs) differentiation and maturation into myelinating oligodendrocytes (OLs). Accumulating evidence suggests that the different functional phenotypes of microglia/macrophages contribute considerably to the regulation of inflammatory status of injured WM and ultimately impact the WM integrity. Specifically, alternatively activated M2 microglia are essential for remyelination and WM repair because they resolve local inflammation, clear broken myelin sheath or cellular debris, and provide trophic factors that promote OPC differentiation.  Interleukin-4 (IL-4) is thus far the best characterized inducer for M2 polarization of microglia/macrophages; however, its role in microglia regulation in WM and long term outcomes after TBI is not known. Our preliminary results show that post-treatment with IL-4 nanoparticle through intranasal delivery increased IL-4 levels in the brain and improved long-term neurological functions after controlled cortical impact (CCI). Remarkably, IL-4 treatment enhanced post-CCI WM functional integrity, as shown by increased amplitude of action potential conduction in myelinated fibers. We have found in vitro that in addition to promoting M2 polarization, IL-4 directly induces the differentiation of primary OPCs into mature OLs at nanomolar concentrations and that this effect of IL-4 on OPCs is mediated through the activation of PPAR?.  In this proposal, we will focus on the novel action  of IL-4 on WM integrity and explore the underlying mechanisms. We will test the overarching hypothesis that IL-4 promotes WM integrity and long-term neurological recovery after TBI by dual mechanisms, in that it 1) promotes OPC differentiation/ maturation via PPAR? activation and 2) potentiates microglia/macrophage polarization toward the beneficial M2 phenotype, which is essential for remyelination and WM repair in demyelinating brains. The Specific Aims to be tested are: Aim 1: Test the hypothesis that IL-4 post-treatment enhances WM integrity and long-term neurological recovery after TBI. IL-4 will be delivered into the brain by repeated intranasal administrations after CCI. The endpoints for assessment include neurological outcomes and various markers for WM integrity. Aim 2: Test the hypothesis that IL-4 induces OPC differentiation into mature OLs and promotes axonal remyelination via PPAR? activation. Aim 3: Test the hypothesis that IL-4 potentiates microglia/macrophage polarization into the inflammation-resolving, tissue repair-enhancing M2 phenotype and restores a healthy microenvironment for efficient WM repair. The success of this study will identify a novel immunotherapy to enhance rehabilitation and therefore improve quality of life for veterans suffering TBI."
"9378391","Both vitamin D deficiency and skin cancers arising from epidermal keratinocytes are highly prevalent in Veterans. Although exposure to the ultraviolet (UV) wavelengths normally found in sunlight initiates vitamin D biosynthesis, the practice is not currently recommended since UV is also the principal cause of skin cancers. However, there remains uncertainty as to whether the relatively low doses sufficient for vitamin D production in the skin are associated with a meaningful risk of skin cancer in healthy individuals, and the Institute of Medicine's report on this topic identified resolving this issue as a major research need. Based on work in both our laboratory and those of others, there is evidence that UV-inducible mechanisms such as DNA repair might be directly coupled to vitamin D signaling. For example, we have observed that mice lacking the vitamin D receptor are prone to develop UV-induced epidermal tumors, and vitamin D and some of its metabolites induce DNA repair proteins. On the other hand, mice unable to synthesize the most biologically active form of vitamin D are not tumor-prone. However, it remains possible that one or more of the multiple other vitamin D metabolites does have anti-photocarcinogenic effects, including induction of nucleotide excision repair activity, the principal mechanism for removing UV-induced DNA lesions. The overall hypothesis of this research proposal is that vitamin D or its derivatives stimulate compensatory mechanisms to repair the collateral DNA damage associated with its own UV-mediated photosynthesis and thus minimizes photocarcinogenic effects. In Aim I, cultured keratinocytes and epidermal explants derived from CYP27B1-null mice will be used to compare the activities of major vitamin D3 metabolites for their effects on nucleotide excision repair. Both exogenous supplementation and chemical inhibition to modulate endogenous vitamin D metabolite levels will be employed, and expression of repair genes as well as repair activity and UV resistance will be assayed. In Aim II, both genomic and non-genomic mechanisms for vitamin D's effects on DNA repair will be investigated. Cultured keratinocytes and mouse epidermal explants will be used to assess the relevance of the vitamin D receptor in DNA repair, and the assembly and stability of nucleotide excision repair factors at lesions. Aim III will use mice treated with the most active vitamin D derivative and the broad cytochrome P450 inhibitor, ketoconazole, to assess whether supplementation or depletion of the major vitamin D3 metabolites protects animals from photocarcinogenesis, or predisposes them to it. Mutational spectra of tumors in the TP53 and XPC genes will also be analyzed to understand the pathways involved. These studies should make an important contribution to understanding the physiological and cellular mechanistic role of vitamin D in regulating DNA repair in skin and in suppressing UV photocarcinogenesis. The resulting fundamental biological insights may allow a rational basis to help guide health policy decisions regarding vitamin D in nutrition and skin cancer prevention for Veterans as well as the general population."
"9487853","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         The sodium chloride co-transporter (NCC) and the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) are two key sodium transporting proteins in the distal tubule of the mammalian kidney. Hyperactivity of either protein results in hypertension and hypoactivity results in hypotension. These two proteins are co-expressed in the second part of the distal convoluted tubule (DCT2) and are regulated by many of the same proteins. However, associations between the two have not been investigated. Preliminary data indicates that the proteins associate in a sodium transporting complex and co-localize in the apical membrane of the DCT2. Investigating the relationship between ENaC and NCC in this key nephron segment has the potential to significantly alter our understanding of salt transport in the mammalian kidney. We now propose to examine the interaction of NCC with each subunit of ENaC, examine the functional implications of this interaction and investigate association-dependent alterations in regulation of these proteins by aldosterone.  Co-localization (in vivo and in vitro), native association, and proximity of NCC and each ENaC subunit will be examined. The ENaC subunit(s) that are critical for binding to NCC will also be determined. These studies will define the association between NCC and each ENaC subunit. Then the impact of this association on function, protein expression, surface expression and response to inhibitors of both sodium transporters will be investigated. These studies will determine the functional implications of this interaction. Then aldosterone-induced changes in function, protein expression and surface expression of NCC and ENaC will be examined in the absence or presence of the other. The aldosterone-induced phosphorylation of NCC with and without ENaC will also be investigated. Additionally the association of NEDD4-2 with NCC in the absence and presence of ENaC subunits will be determined. These studies will determine whether the NCC alters the regulation of ENaC by aldosterone and whether any of the ENaC subunits alter the regulation of NCC by aldosterone.  A variety of methods will be utilized to address these issues. Function of NCC will be assessed by thiazide-sensitive 22Na+ uptakes in mouse distal convoluted tubule cells (mDCT15). For measurement of ENaC function, Dr. Doug Eaton's lab will use single channel whole-cell patch clamping to assess ENaC function. The proximity of these proteins will be assessed utilizing Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET). Signal will be detected with confocal microscopy. Native association will be examined through the use of Blue Native PAGE. Electron Microscopy will be used to examine association under aldosterone stimulation. Lentiviral shRNA transduction particles will be used to knockdown protein expression in mDCT15 cells. Small animal surgeries with implantation of osmotic minipumps will be used to examine the effects of aldosterone on the NCC-ENaC association on the organismal level. Additionally standard methodologies such as immunoblotting, SDS-PAGE, biotinylation, transfection, co- immunoprecipitation and immunohistochemistry will be used."
"9449207","Project Summary/Abstract Allergic diseases, including asthma, allergic rhinitis, and food allergy, have been steadily increasing in incidence and disproportionately affect children. Allergic responses can be triggered rapidly upon exposure to an allergen that binds to IgE antibodies on mast cells and basophils; these cells then degranulate and release potent pro-inflammatory mediators. If this response occurs systemically, known as anaphylaxis, it can be life- threatening. However, despite the importance of IgE in allergic disease, the intrinsic mechanisms that regulate IgE-expressing B cells remain unclear. Recent technical advances have made it possible to directly detect and visualize IgE+ B cells in mice, revealing that IgE+ B cells undergo an abortive germinal center phase and are predisposed to differentiate into short-lived plasma cells. These properties of IgE+ B cells restrain IgE responses and therefore may help protect against allergy and anaphylaxis in healthy individuals. Recent studies have demonstrated that the distinct features of mouse IgE+ B cells are largely due to the expression of the membrane IgE B cell receptor, which has weak, chronic signaling activity compared with other isotypes. The overall objective of this study is to determine how B cell receptor signaling regulates IgE+ B cell responses in mice and whether these findings are applicable to human B cells. The specific goals of this study are to 1) elucidate the mechanisms by which B cell receptor signaling regulates IgE plasma cell responses, 2) to characterize the role of B cell receptor signaling in the dynamics of IgE+ B cells in germinal centers, and 3) to determine whether human IgE B cell receptors regulate IgE responses in a similar fashion to mouse IgE B cell receptors. The results from these studies will help us understand how potent IgE-mediated allergic responses are controlled at a molecular level. ."
"9486889","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         A greater magnitude of gut microbial product translocation (MT) and gut permeability in women may have important clinical implications for risk of developing autoimmune diseases as well as resistance to infection and response to vaccines. Increases in the inflammatory CD14+CD16++ monocyte subset and enhanced monocyte activation in women may alter effector responses of these cells to bacterial and viral infection and to TLR agonists, resulting in an increased susceptibility to autoimmune disease in women compared to men. TLRs and TLR-signaling downstream cytokines (e.g., IFN-?IL-6, IL-1?TNF-?play a key role in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases, and treatments against specific cytokines or TLR inhibitors are effective in SLE patients and murine models. We hypothesize that sex hormone mediated permeable gut and resultant increased magnitude of MT are fundamental drivers for pro-inflammatory cytokine production monocyte activation and sex bias in autoimmune disease. Understanding these mechanisms is likely to provide insights crucial for the development of sex-specific interventions for autoimmune disorders and other diseases sharing sex differences such as Hepatitis C and HIV. Sex-based differences in MT provide a model for analysis of the effects of MT and altered innate immune responses on adaptive immunity and disease pathogenesis in vivo. If our hypothesis is correct-that heightened MT or altered TLR responsiveness in healthy women results in heightened persistent immune activation and pro-inflammatory cytokines, and that heightened inflammation results in enhanced susceptibility and heightened disease activity in SLE-, a therapeutic strategy (e.g., mucosal protector/microbes) may help reverse high levels of persistent inflammation, thereby helping to reestablish normal immunity/tolerance in autoimmune diseases. SPECIFIC AIM 1: Determine the role of sex hormones in gut permeability and the magnitude of microbial product translocation in healthy controls and patients with SLE in vivo and in vitro. Our preliminary data show that premenopausal women have higher plasma levels of total bacterial rDNA, a marker of MT in vivo, compared to men and postmenopausal women. To understand the impact of microbial products from plasma and the gut on systemic immunity and SLE, we will analyze microbial genetic potential by metagenomic sequencing in plasma. SPECIFIC AIM 2: Determine the role of sex hormones in TLR4 responsiveness and monocyte activation. We hypothesize that gut permeability and heightened MT result in monocyte activation in women. We will assess monocyte subset differentiation and potential drivers on monocytes. We will analyze the relatedness/correlation between MT, TLR4 responsiveness, monocyte activation, levels of sex hormones, and SLE disease activity. SPECIFIC AIM 3: Determine the impact of estrogen on gut permeability and monocyte activation in a cohort of postmenopausal women. In this aim, we will analyze the magnitude of MT and monocyte activation in 40 postmenopausal women before and after receiving hormone replacement therapy. By defining mechanisms of sex differences in gut mucosal integrity, MT and systemic immunity and by demonstrating a relationship among gut permeability, MT, TLR4 responsiveness and monocyte activation in vivo, we will establish the plausibility of this model in the pathogenesis of SLE. These findings have broader implications including vaccine responses, infectious disease risk, and risk of other autoimmune diseases."
"9396406","Project Summary/Abstract  Dyslexia and other language-based reading disorders (RD) account for nearly 85% of children receiving special education services in the U.S. RD affect between 5% and 17% of school-age children with boys at higher risk than girls. Children with RD are at high risk for academic failure and future underemployment. The current diagnosis of RD relies on behavioral symptoms. This means that RD cannot be identified until after the child has begun to learn to read. By this time, a potentially opportune window for intervention has been missed. Early identification and prevention is possible by using genetic markers because RD have a high heritability rate. The existing genetic studies about RD are limited in the sense that the gene-RD association was evaluated on a one-gene-at-a-time basis. This approach is not efficient because hundreds of thousands of genes need to be evaluated; nor is it effective because it runs a high risk of miss-detecting important genes due to overly-strict multiple test corrections applied to too many genes. Also, the existing one-gene-at-a-time approach only examines the marginal association of each gene with RD, without accounting for the joint effect of multiple genes and their interaction in relation to RD. For a complex phenotype like RD, a multi-gene- interactive mechanism is more plausible and has been supported by recent studies. Despite this, little research has been done to discover the genes simultaneously and characterize their interactions. This is partially because this field has not been able to take advantage of modern machine learning developments that provide effective and efficient approaches for genetic big data modeling and analysis. Another limitation of the existing studies is that they have been focused on single behavioral deficits and did not account for demographic difference. The short-term goals for this proposed project are to identify the gene sets associated with RD, link the gene sets to enriched functional biological pathways, characterize the gene-RD associations across the behavioral deficits in multiple reading abilities and accounting for demographic differences, and validate the findings using existing population-based datasets. These goals will be achieved using a combination of advanced machine learning algorithms and pathway analyses that are applied to existing population-based RD data sources. There are two specific aims: Aim 1 focuses on identification of significant genes and their interactions in relation to RD using sparse machine learning models and pathway analysis; Aim 2 focuses on validation for the models and findings in Aim 1 using the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) dataset and another independent dataset. The long-term goal of this research is to contribute to the development of personalized early identification methods and early intervention for children at risk of RD."
"9378720","Although metformin is first line treatment for patients with diabetes (DM), many patients with moderate chronic kidney disease (CKD) do not receive metformin due to concerns about the risk of lactic acidosis. Within the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) 30-40% of incident DM medications are sulfonylureas, rather than metformin, due in part to underlying CKD. Our group and others have demonstrated that among patients with preserved kidney function, metformin use is associated with better cardiovascular, kidney, and survival outcomes compared with sulfonylureas.1-4 The rapidly increasing number of patients with DM and moderate CKD may also derive cardiovascular and renal benefits from metformin, but do not receive this recommended first line therapy due to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) warning (contraindication at serum creatinine >1.5 mg/dL for men; >1.4mg/dL for women). Guidelines in the United Kingdom, Canada, and Australia emphasize metformin use based on estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) criteria rather than creatinine. Patients with reduced eGFR may use metformin with frequent monitoring and dose reduction, and an eGFR <30 mL/min is considered an absolute contraindication to metformin. Formal petitions to revise the FDA warning to consider eGFR based prescribing have been filed but additional evidence is needed to inform these policy decisions.6, 7 Randomized trials would be ideal, but the large number of patients needed and existing warning make such studies prohibitive. Methodologically-strong comparative effectiveness observational studies are necessary to determine the relative benefits and risks of metformin versus sulfonylureas use among patients with CKD. This proposal will answer the question: Among patients with Stage 3 CKD, what are the absolute risks of lactic acidosis and cardiovascular and renal events for those initially treated with metformin compared to those treated with a sulfonylurea? We will rebuild an inception diabetes cohort utilizing national Veterans Health Administration (VHA) data (corporate data warehouse-vital signs; pharmacy, medical datasets, Medicare/ Medicaid data and vital status files), national death index and data on echocardiograms. Eligible veterans will have a baseline creatinine >1.5 mg/dL or an eGFR between 30 and 59 ml/min and initially treated with metformin (current N=16,891 through FY2008; anticipated rebuilt cohort N~86,924) or sulfonylurea (current N=41,952; anticipated rebuilt cohort N~149,869). The proposed study follows this inception cohort from monotherapy initiation until an outcome or censoring event (leave VHA, change therapy or death). The comparisons of interest will be: metformin vs. sulfonylurea. Persons included are aged >18 years, utilize VHA from 10/1/2000 through 09/30/2014. In this national cohort of veterans with diabetes and impaired renal function: Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that the risk of hospitalization for laboratory-confirmed lactic acidosis in patients treated with metformin is similar to the risk in patients treated with sulfonylureas. Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that fatal or nonfatal cardiovascular events is lower among patients treated with metformin versus sulfonylureas. Aim 3 will test the hypothesis that heart failure hospitalizations or emergency visits is lower among patients treated with metformin versus sulfonylureas. Aim 4 will test the hypothesis that CKD progression and all-cause mortality is lower among patients treated with metformin versus sulfonylureas. Propensity score matching will be used to achieve similar groups. We will compare event rates accounting for baseline and time-varying covariates with marginal structural Cox proportional hazards models (MSM) with ?stabilized? inverse probability treatment weights (IPTW). Our team has been extremely productive over the last 3 years and is poised to conduct a rigorous and necessary evaluation of the effectiveness of DM regimens among patients with CKD. Our publication record attests to our ability to use VHA data for accurate measurement of exposures, outcomes and covariates."
"9486838","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):           Cystogenesis is critical for early kidney development; however, if renal cystogenesis is delayed and/or occurs in an incorrect context, the resulting cysts can destroy kidney structure, thereby promoting polycystic kidney disease (PKD) and renal failure. Virtually all forms of PKD in human patients and animal models are associated with perturbations in renal primary cilia structure and/or function. For example, mutations in genes encoding the ciliary proteins polycystins-1 and -2 cause autosomal dominant PKD (ADPKD), the most common potentially lethal monogenic disorder in humans, while mutations in multiple ciliary proteins lead to nephronophthisis, a form of PKD that is the most common genetic cause of renal failure in children and young adults. Although maintenance of primary cilia structure and function appears to be key to preventing/treating PKD, it is not entirely clear how aberrant ciliogenesis promotes disease. Moreover, since there are no approved treatments for any form of PKD, and even the most promising treatments have significant side effects and/or toxicities, a more thorough understanding of primary cilia formation/function is critical for the identification of future therapeutic targets for the treatment of PKD. The long-term goal of our laboratory is to identify the mechanistic basis for ciliogenesis, and determine how aberrations in this process contribute to PKD. Our laboratory was the first to show that the highly-conserved eight-protein exocyst complex, which promotes targeting and docking of vesicles carrying proteins from the trans-Golgi network (TGN), localizes to, and is necessary for formation of, primary cilia. Notably, mutations in an exocyst protein, identified in a family with nephronophthisis, support a role for the exocyst in prevention of PKD. The exocyst has been shown to be critical for targeting Rab8-positive vesicles bearing ciliary proteins to the nascent cilium. More recently, we demonstrated that both the small GTPase Cdc42 and Tuba, a Cdc42 ciliary-specific guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF), regulate targeting of the exocyst itself to the nascent cilium, where the Sec10 component of the exocyst directly interacts with the Par complex. Most notably, we recently demonstrated that cdc42 knockdown in zebrafish causes ciliary defects and Cdc42 kidney-specific knockout in mice prevents ciliogenesis, which leads to a PKD nephronophthisis phenotype, renal failure, and death. Preliminary data show that tuba knockdown in zebrafish results in a similar phenotype. Based on these data, we hypothesize that activation of Cdc42 by one or more ciliary-specific GEFs is required to recruit the exocyst to the nascent cilium, thereby  promoting Sec10/Par6 stabilizing interactions that allow for the targeting of Rab8-positive vesicles bearing ciliary proteins to promote ciliogenesis (tested in Aims 1 and 2). We are in a unique position to undertake these experiments as we have all the necessary tools, techniques, and reagents. As proper cilia formation and function are critical for preventing PKD, further understanding of a major delivery route for ciliary proteins will likely identify a number of novel  candidate targets and points of therapeutic intervention. We also showed that Cdc42 and Sec10 disruption in vitro and in vivo leads to MAPK activation and an increase in phosphorylated ERK (pERK). As MAPK activation occurs in the nephronophthisis pcy mouse, and pharmacologic normalization of pERK prevents cystogenesis, we further hypothesize that inhibition of exocyst localization/stabilization at the nascent cilium results in abnormal MAPK activation that, in turn,  leads to PKD. In Aim 3, we will take a pharmacologic approach to test this hypothesis in our Cdc42 and Sec10 knockdown zebrafish and conditional murine knockout models, and will also exploit our recently described novel adeno-associated viral (AAV) vector, and retrograde delivery system, that allows for gene expression in murine kidney tubule cells. Taken together, our work opens up new avenues for the treatment of PKD: utilizing pharmacologic means to inhibit the MAPK pathway, and molecular biology to deliver wild-type genes to rescue inherited ciliopathies."
"9283289","Project Summary / Abstract  Antibodies are a major cause of acute and chronic rejection in renal transplants. Some pathologic  manifestations of acute antibody-mediated rejection (AMR) that has progressed to graft dysfunction have been  defined. However, it is evident that not all of the mediators of AMR have been identified. The potentially  reversible stages that precede graft impairment are difficult to resolve in clinical studies even with protocol  biopsies because of uncontrollable variables inherent among patients. We have used in vitro and in vivo  models to demonstrate that antibodies stimulate endothelial cells to exocytose von Willebrand factor and P-  selectin. We propose that activated platelets have critical functions in early AMR and greatly expand  inflammation by interacting with endothelial cells and leukocytes. We reported that platelet factor 4 and  serotonin accumulated in renal allografts at 100- to 1000-fold higher concentrations compared with other  platelet-transported mediators. The localization of large quantities of platelet factor 4 in the allograft has  multiple consequences on macrophage function. These interactions are particularly relevant because  macrophage infiltrates in human biopsies are a characteristic of AMR. Release of serotonin from platelets also  has potential to recruit leukocytes to renal transplants. In addition, platelets can stimulate monocytes and  macrophages indirectly at sites of inflammation where endothelial cells release increased amounts of the  extracellular matrix protein hyaluronan. Hyaluronidase 2 expressed by activated platelets cleaves HA into  fragments that act as danger signals to stimulate macrophages through toll like receptors. The potential  beneficial effects of modulating platelet activation in AMR have not been tested fully. In addition to blocking  specific platelet mediators, we have found that clinically relevant complement inhibitors are one approach to  decrease platelet localization in allografts. We propose the hypothesis that antibodies initiate platelet and  endothelial responses that augment leukocyte interactions with blood vessels in renal transplants  during AMR. We will test this hypothesis in 3 specific aims: 1) Test the role of platelet-derived mediators in  directly causing injury to renal transplants; 2) Test the multiple effects of C1 inhibitor on recruitment and  activation of platelets and macrophages; and 3) Test the role of hyaluronan released by vascular endothelium  and cleaved by platelets in augmenting inflammation and contributing to fibrosis in renal transplants. To  accomplish these specific aims, we will use mouse models of AMR in renal transplants that have been  developed by Drs. Fairchild and Valujskikh in Projects 1 and 3 in the previous funding period as well as the  passive transfer models developed in our Project 2. Our goals for each specific aim are to understand  mechanisms by which platelets contribute to AMR, identify biomarkers of platelet-induced injury and  test potential therapeutic interventions."
"9486835","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):          Failure of the right ventricle (RV) is a prevalent cause of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality,  and the leading cause of death in patients with pulmonary hypertension. Moreover, RV failure frequently arises in patients with failure of the left ventricle (LV) and causes markedly worse symptoms and prognosis contrasted with patients with LV failure without RV dysfunction. Despite clinical significance, RV failure is relatively understudied, poorly understood and there i a need for more effective therapies to treat RV failure. We reported that the inotropic response to stimulation of ?1-adrenergic receptors (?1-ARs) is fundamentally different in the RV (negative  inotropy) vs. LV (positive inotropy). Importantly, in RV failure, ?1-AR inotropic responses are upregulated and switched from a negative inotropic response in non-failing RV to a robust positive inotropic response in failing RV. This renewal project will build on the following recent observations: * Of the two major cardiac ?1-AR subtypes (?1A & ?1B), the dramatic switch from ?1-AR-mediated negative  inotropy in non-failing RV to positive inotropy in failing RV is mediated solely by the ?1A-subtype but not  the ?1B-subtype, suggesting that ?1A-subtype signaling is upregulated in failing RV.  Consistent with beneficial effects mediated by the ?1A-subtype, in a model of RV failure, treatment for 2  wk. with the ?1A-subtype-specific agonist A61603 has major beneficial effects evidenced by improved in-  vivo function, and reduced myocardial injury (evidenced by lower serum cardiac TnI, less myocardial  fibrosis, and less ultrastructural cellular damage observed in electron micrographs). * Mechanistically, levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) are elevated in failing RV, and our preliminary  studies show that for failing RV, chronic treatment with A61603 increased levels of superoxide dismutase  (SOD) and markedly reduced ROS. * ROS increases expression and activity of two intracellular isoforms of matrix-metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2):  the canonical full-length MMP-2 (FL-MMP-2) and a novel N-terminal truncated isoform (NTT-MMP-2). We  reported that FL-MMP-2 impairs myocardial force by causing damage to the myofilaments. In contrast, we  found that NTT-MMP-2 impairs myocardial force by impairing Ca2+ handling, without damage to myofilaments. * Chronic treatment with A61603 markedly reduces levels of FL-MMP-2 and NTT-MMP-2. Thus, for failing  RV, ?1A-subtype-mediated lowering of FL-MMP-2 and NTT-MMP-2 levels may reduce damage to  myofilaments and Ca2+ handling. Consistent with this, we found that for failing RV chronic treatment with  A61603 increased myofilament function.  1. Hypothesis: For failing RV, chronic ?1A-subtype stimulation causes reduced ROS, which leads to  decreased levels of FL-MMP-2 and NTT-MMP-2, and thereby, to reduced damage to myofilaments and  Ca2+ handling.  2. Hypothesis: Chronic therapy with a ?1A-subtype agonist is beneficial in a chronic model of RV failure. Aim 1. Determine the mechanisms for the beneficial effects of ?1A-subtype therapy in RV failure. For failing RV, we will determine if the beneficial effects of ?1A therapy with A61603 involves increased SOD, leading to reduced ROS, which results in lower levels of FL-MMP-2 and NTT-MMP-2, and thereby, reduced damage to myofilaments and Ca2+ handling. Aim 2. Determine if chronic ?1A therapy has a beneficial effect on recovery of RV function in a chronic model of already established RV failure. Using a chronic pulmonary stenosis model of established RV failure, we will chronically treat mice for up to 20 wk. with A61603. We will determine if A61603 induces recovery of RV function and outcomes in chronic RV failure, and determine the mechanisms involved."
"9486837","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         70 million Americans suffer from some sort of sleep disorder. Behavior, mood and memory deteriorate with sleep loss and it gets worse with continuing sleep deprivation. There is considerable amount of data on arousal neurons whereas very little is known about the neurons that make us fall asleep. Indeed, current network models of sleep-wake regulation list many arousal neuronal populations compared to only one sleep group located in the preoptic area. Better hypnotics will emerge if there was direct evidence linking specific phenotypes of neurons to sleep. To provide this evidence, we will use optogenetics to selectively manipulate sleep- active neurons. One group of sleep-active neurons is located in the preoptic area and contains galanin. Using galanin-Cre mice, the gene for the light-sensitive excitatory opsin, channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2), or the inhibitory opsin, enhanced Archaerhodopsin (eArch3.0), will be inserted into the galanin neurons and effects on sleep measured. Galanin neurons in the preoptic area will be optogenetically stimulated or inhibited during the night or day and under conditions that alter the animal's internal drive to stay awake (24h fasting) or sleep (6h sleep deprivation). In the same mouse, the second group of sleep-active neurons located in the lateral hypothalamus that contain melanin concentrating hormone (MCH) will be stimulated/inhibited with light. Recently, we published data indicating that stimulation of the MCH neurons robustly increases both non-REM and REM sleep. Now that there are two sleep- active neuronal groups it is necessary to simultaneously activate/inhibit both groups, or activate one while inhibiting th other to determine potency of each to sleep. To demonstrate that the stimulated neurons release the peptide an ELISA assay will be used to detect galanin and MCH in the CSF after 6h of optogenetic stimulation. Separate electrophysiology studies will directly monitor neuronal activity in the brain and determine the pattern of activity as the sleep-inducing signal propagates across the network. Does stimulation of the preoptic sleep-active neurons activate the distally located MCH sleep-active neurons? Do neurons adjacent to the stimulation site respond earlier or at the same time as distal arousal neurons? What is the temporal response of specific sleep versus wake neurons to the stimulation and to the emergence of sleep? Such brain activity maps are essential to identify functional connectivity and are consistent with the Brain Activity Map Project. From a translational perspective these studies are potentially useful in sleep disorders, such as insomnia, where sleep needs to be triggered against a strong arousal drive. These aims will provide a framework for integrating the sleep-active neurons within an overall model of sleep- wake regulation."

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Up to one third of the 700,000 men and women who served in Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm during the 1990-1991 Gulf War (GW) have developed a chronic multisystem illness known as Gulf War Veterans' Illness (GWVI). Neurobehavioral findings include memory problems, executive system deficits, slowed motor and processing speeds, sustained attention deficits, reduced visuospatial skills and psychomotor dysfunction. Given the spectrum of cognitive deficits noted above, combined with evidence of structural and functional abnormalities on neuroimaging, it is likely that neuropathological changes also occur in GWVI. Several environmental exposures have been implicated as potential contributors to GWVI including exposure to acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitors such as pyridostigmine bromide (PB; anti-nerve gas pills) and organophosphate (OP) pesticides/nerve agents (e.g., sarin/cyclosarin). The pattern of deficits may be related to whether GWV were exposed to OP nerve agents as well as their premorbid vulnerability (e.g., PON1 status) to such exposures. GWV may also be at higher risk for developing a progressive neurodegenerative disorder    such as Alzheimer's Disease as they age. Some studies suggest that accelerated aging may occur in GWVI related to axonal transport deficits, increased axial diffusivity, increased WM anisotropy on diffusion tensor imaging and insulin resistance and/or metabolic syndrome. Findings of reduced hippocampal volume in GWV suggest that that the pattern of deficits may be consistent the development of an Alzheimer-type dementia. This is important to investigate because the GWV cohort in general is aging; 52% of GWV are age 45 and older and 16% are age 55 to 85+. In addition, recent evidence suggests that an unexpectedly large number of GW veterans sustained traumatic brain injuries (TBI) so they may also be at risk for long term sequelae such as chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). Given the issues raised above, there is a critical need for a GWVI CNS tissue biorepository that will conduct extensive ante mortem longitudinal assessments on enrolled GWV.    Our first specific aim is to establish a VA GWVIB as a national resource to support research on the etiology and pathogenesis of GWRI and our second aim is to perform selected psychometric and biological assessments on enrollees to maximize the value of tissue donated to the GWVIB. Well-characterized CNS tissue when combined with antemortem health data and biological assessments (such as ApoE genotype and serum PON1 activity) will be invaluable to advance research on GWVI. The GWVIB will be a multi-site collaboration among VA Boston Healthcare System (VABHS) and the Southern Arizona VA Healthcare System (SAVAHCS). The GWVIB will utilize strengths across the Boston and Tucson sites in enrollment, tissue collection, processing, storage, neuropathological diagnosis, medical informatics and data management. VABHS will serve as the operations/data coordinating center and conduct the neuropathological diagnostic analyses, with SAVAHCS contributing expertise in CNS tissue processing and storage. SAVAHCS will also coordinate CNS tissue distribution. Notable enhancements to be initiated are the utilization of an active versus passive recruitment approach, enlarging our collection of tissue from Veteran controls through a collaboration with the National Disease Research Interchange (NDRI), and improved outreach to investigators to increase the utilization of the GWVIB in GWI research. This will allow us to leverage the substantial investment of VA resources already in place at GWVIB and to add value to existing clinical and CNS tissue resources."
"9487887","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Hypertension is a major cause of chronic kidney disease in the Veterans that leads to end stage renal disease. The current therapeutic options in the clinical settings for this devastating condition are limited and often ineffective except dialysis or kidney transplantation. Therefore, a better understanding of the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of hypertensive kidney disease is essential for developing effective strategies for the treatment of this progressive kidney disorder.  We have studied the factors initiating and controlling the development of hypertensive kidney disease in a model of angiotensin II-induced hypertension and have discovered a critical and obligate role for immune-inflammatory dysregulation in the initiation of hypertensive kidney disease. We have found that the development of hypertensive kidney disease arises from the infiltration of mononuclear cells (monocytes/macrophage, T cells, and bone marrow-derived fibroblasts) into the kidney. The presence and activation of these cells from a CD45+ mononuclear population appear to be driven by and dependent upon induction of the chemokine, CXCL16, in renal tubular epithelial cells and is prevented by genetic disruption of CXCL16. Our preliminary studies have shown that induction of CXCL16 is associated with striking activation of PI3 kinase signaling in vivo, which is regulated by p PTEN) and the adaptor protein containing a PH domain, PTB domain, and leucine zipper motif 1 (APPL1) in vitro. Therefore, we hosphatase and tensin homologue deleted on chromosome ten (hypothesize that pathologic renal injury and fibrosis arises from immune-inflammatory dysregulation associated with induction of CXCL16 and subsequent activation of PI3 kinase /Akt. We propose that CXCL16 triggers PI3 kinase /Akt activation, initiating the uptake of circulating mononuclear cell population obligate to the resultant kidney injury and fibrosis, which is regulated by PTEN and APPL1. To test our hypothesis, we will pursue the following Specific Aims: Specific Aim 1 is to determine the role of PI3K in the recruitment of bone marrow-derived mononuclear cells in vitro and in vivo. Specific Aim 2 is to examine whether PTEN regulates PI3K/Akt signaling and inflammatory cell migration in vitro and in vivo. Specific Aim 3 is to evaluate whether APPL1 function as a negative regulator of PI3K/Akt signaling and inflammatory cell migration in vitro and in vivo.  In summary, we plan to utilize biological, pharmacological, and genetic approaches to study the signaling mechanisms underlying immune-inflammatory dysregulation in the pathogenesis of Ang II- induced renal injury and fibrosis. Results from our studies will provide a new understanding of the molecular and cellular bases of hypertensive kidney disease and could lead to the development of novel therapeutic strategies for the treatment of hypertensive kidney disease."
"9487859","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Background/Rationale: HIV-1 infection and its prevention are of particular importance to the health of veterans, with 1 out of 250 veterans known to be HIV-1 infected. Prevention of HIV-1 was specifically mentioned as one of the 3 main goals in President Obama's National HIV/AIDS Strategy in 2010, as well as the Department of Veterans Affairs National HIV/AIDS Strategy Operational Plan in 2011. Our group has focused on a preventive vaccine for HIV-1 through study of potent antibodies directed at HIV-1. A limited number of persons infected with HIV-1 develop circulating plasma antibodies able to potently neutralize a wide variety of HIV-1 isolates representing different genetic subtypes. It is widely held that the characteristics and specificitis of such antibodies can be used to guide the development of HIV-1 vaccine candidates capable of eliciting protective humoral immunity in a target population. Current methods for study of these antibodies include isolation of antibodies from memory B cells, which may not always reflect the antibodies circulating in the blood. Our research has focused on the identification of characterization of the broad neutralizing antibodies directly from patient serum (without potential bias of selection), as neutralizing antibody characteristics seen in multiple individuals are more likely be raised in a broad population. We have noted particular biochemical signatures that point to a common dominant, acidic epitope that is targeted on the envelope of HIV. Objectives: The specific hypothesis of this proposal is that the broad HIV-1 neutralizing response in plasma is due to a shared acidic epitope on the gp120 envelope. The specific aims of the project are to 1) Directly isolate and sequence the antibodies responsible for the broad neutralization from the plasma of HIV-1 infected individuals, and 2) Map the corresponding epitope(s) of the broad neutralizing antibodies to test the hypothesis that a shared acidic epitope of gp120 is responsible for the broad HIV-1 neutralization response. Methods: We have identified 10 patients with broad neutralization, of which 3 will be studies in detail. The affinit purification (antigen, subclass, and light chain specific) and fractionation (free-flow isoelectric focusing) scheme can narrow the antibodies of interest, directly, from the plasma to individual species. These species will be tested for broad neutralization. Upon confirmation, the individual antibody bands will be sequenced de novo using both LC-MS and Edman degradation (N-terminal and internal sequencing). Epitope mapping of the new mAbs will be undertaken with Elisa, mutagenesis studies, and X-ray crystallography. Once the epitope is identified, Elisa and mutagenesis studies will be used to test the active fraction on the other 7 individuals to determine if this epitope is responsible for broad neutralization. Findings: Anticipated results wil be isolation of new mAbs, identification of common characteristics of broadly neutralizing abs, and the identification of a common acidic epitope that can direct broad HIV-1 neutralization. Status: We have completed enough work on the techniques described herein (as well as each alternative plan) to ensure that the aims are feasible and will be completed. Impact: If our hypothesis proves correct, then the results will be novel and directly applicable to the study of HIV vaccines. This study will provide a deeper understanding of possibilities of the broad HIV-1 neutralizing response in humans, and it will also have identified a naturally occurring epitope(s) that can be the target of potent cross-clade antibodies against HIV-1. This will have an impact on the designs of an HIV vaccine, which when developed will improve the health of veterans by preventing this life-long disease."
"9501671","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Tobacco and alcohol are the two most used and abused drugs in the world. Together, they are responsible for millions of deaths each year worldwide. Despite the enormous amount of research carried out to understand how these agents affect the lung, new information leading to significant advances at the clinic has been disappointing. Because of the high prevalence of tobacco and alcohol exposure in veterans, the Roman lab is exploring the mechanisms by which these agents affect the lung. Our research revealed that both alcohol and nicotine, an alkaloid present in tobacco, promote alterations in lung matrix composition that we have termed 'transitional' remodeling, a process characterized by subtle alterations in the relatively composition of the lung extracellular matrix. Although the exact mechanisms linking these events to lung disease remain incompletely understood, we believe that transitional remodeling renders the host susceptible to lung disease, and this belief is supported by published research performed both in vitro and in vivo. Considering the above, we set out to identify the cellular/molecular mechanisms responsible for these events. Using cultured primary lung fibroblasts, we found that nicotine induces cellular proliferation and matrix expression through the activation of specific 7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (7 nAChRs). The importance of these receptors was confirmed in vivo showing that prenatal exposure to nicotine affects lung development and induces airway thickening and hyperreactivity in wildtype animals, but not in 7 nAChR knockout mice. Using the same culture model, we discovered that alcohol acts on lung fibroblasts via another set of nAChRs, 4 nAChRs. In rodent lungs, the expression of these receptors is increased by chronic alcohol exposure which, in turn, predisposes to acute lung injury. This work suggests that the cholinergic system plays an important role in lung homeostasis and response to injury, and points to nAChRs as potential targets for intervention. More recently, we found that nAChRs are activated through both ligand-dependent and -independent pathways. Specifically, while nicotine acts on 7 nAChRs in a traditional ligand-dependent fashion, alcohol works, at least in part, through induction of a particular form of oxidant stress (oxidation of the cysteine/cystine redox potential or Eh Cys/CySS) which, together with cysteine residues strategically located on the subunits of certain nAChR pentamers, activates nAChR signaling via ligand-independent mechanisms of action. Importantly, we have generated preliminary data to suggest that susceptibility to injury in aging might activate nAChRs through similar pathways thereby promoting transitional remodeling and increased susceptibility to lung injury. Considering the above, we propose that aging (as observed for nicotine and ethanol exposure) is associated with lung transitional remodeling via distinct nAChRs. nAChRs can be activated via ligand-dependent and -independent pathways, the latter triggered by oxidant stress induced by oxidation of the Eh Cys/CySS. Specifically, oxidant stress affects cysteines strategically located in the ? subunits of nAChRs which, in turn, triggers signal transduction and promotes lung transitional remodeling and increase susceptibility to disrepair after lung injury. To test this hypothesis, we propose experiments designed to: Aim 1. Investigate the role of specific subunit cysteines in nAChR activation in lung cells and in vivo. Aim 2. Determine the role of oxidant stress, especially, oxidation of the Eh Cys/CySS in nAChR activation both in vitro and in vivo. Aim 3. Examine the role of nAChR activation in lung disease related to aging and how this is affected by tobacco and alcohol exposure."
"9486892","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is a major public health challenge and a growing problem for the Veteran's Affairs (VA) Health System and the Department of Defense (DoD)[1]. While effective treatments for PTSD such as Prolonged Exposure (PE) have been developed [4], a significant number of patients remain symptomatic or are unable to utilize these treatments to their full potential [4, 5]. Thus, optimization of these treatments is essential. Optimizing PE is ot simple, and isolating specific components and then empirically testing them requires multiple studies, large numbers of subjects and thus, is prohibitively expensive. Alternatively, integrating affective neuroscience methods, such as identifying specific potential biomarkers of treatment change can make each study more informative, effective, and less expensive. Neurobiological studies of PTSD have linked specific candidate biomarkers [endogenous glucocorticoids and neurosteroids, i.e. cortisol, allopregnanolone (ALLO) and metabolites, and dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA/DHEAS)] to PTSD severity and potentially to treatment response. Identifying the mechanisms involved in treatment response can assist in improving therapeutic techniques by targeting specific neurobiological processes involved. Identifying the mechanisms involved in treatment response can assist in improving therapeutic techniques by targeting specific neurobiological processes involved. For instance, identified biomarkers may be used to guide augmentation prior to PE or may lead to directing certain patients to alternate PTSD treatment To this end, we propose an add-on study for an ongoing STRONG STAR affiliated PTSD treatment trial comparing Prolonged Exposure-Web (PE-Web) and Present Centered Therapy (PCT). In our add-on study, we will examine the role of specific candidate biomarkers (endogenous glucocorticoids and neurosteroids, i.e. cortisol awakening response, cortisol response to specific challenge, ALLO and metabolites, and DHEA/DHEAS) collected at Baseline, week 4, Week 8 (post), and one month follow-up as: a) predictors of treatment response, and b) indices of therapeutic change during PTSD treatment. We aim to: 1) identify specific changes in neuroendocrine and neurosteroid patterns that track PTSD symptom changes following effective treatment, 2) examine the specificity of PE-induced neuroendocrine and neurosteroid changes by directly comparing patterns across PE-Web and PCT, and 3) examine whether treatment response related changes in these peripheral biomarkers are directly associated with treatment changes. We expect that increased cortisol responsivity and increases in neurosteroid levels between Baseline and week 8 will be associated with PTSD symptom reduction. Establishing the link between treatment responses and specific biomarkers will allow: mechanism-informed selection of effective treatment (optimizing PE effectiveness), more feasible and effective treatment response studies (increasing efficiency), as well as better individualized treatment tailoring (personalized medicine)."
"9418503","Project Summary/Abstract Type 2 diabetes (T2D) disproportionately affects the Veteran population: while 9% percent of the total US population has T2D, 25% of the Veteran population suffers from this disease. Adult ? cell mass normally increases via replication in response to insulin resistance, but failure of ? cell proliferation plus increased ? cell death lead to T2D. T2D incidence increases with age, in part due to a decreased ability of ? cells to respond to proliferative cues as they get older. Our lab identified the FoxM1 transcription factor as a critical regulator of postnatal ? cell replication and discovered that it is induced in response to several ? cell proliferative stimuli. Foxm1 expression in islets declines with age in mice and humans, but activation of FoxM1 in older mouse ? cells increases ? cell proliferation and ? cell mass, while enhancing ? cell function. Thus, our data demonstrate that FoxM1 is limiting in older ? cells and that activating FoxM1 can bypass inherent brakes in ? cell proliferation. Little is known about how proliferative stimuli induce Foxm1. Our lab discovered that connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) induces Foxm1 and adult ? cell proliferation in mouse islets in vivo and ex vivo and in human islets ex vivo. The mechanisms and signaling pathways through which CTGF has these effects are currently unknown This study makes use of unique in vivo mouse models as well as ex vivo studies in both mouse and human islets from different ages. In this proposal we will identify and manipulate CTGF signaling pathways in ? cells as molecular targets for enhancing proliferation and regeneration in adult ? cells. In addition, we explore mechanisms through which FoxM1 activation enhances ? cell proliferation and survival, focusing on the antagonistic prostaglandin E receptors EP3 and EP4, which are reciprocally regulated by FoxM1 in islets. We hypothesize that CTGF acts through integrin ?1 signaling to induce Foxm1 expression and adult ? cell proliferation, and that in the setting of ? cell death, CTGF function is enhanced by macrophage-derived signals. We further hypothesize that FoxM1 activation overcomes age-related changes in ? cell proliferation in part through alterations in prostaglandin receptor activity. In this proposal we will: 1) Identify signaling pathways through which CTGF activates Foxm1 expression and ? cell proliferation; 2) Identify macrophage- derived factors that cooperate with CTGF to enhance ? cell mass regeneration; and 3) Determine the role of prostaglandin EP receptors in ? cell proliferation and survival. These studies are designed to identify molecular targets to enhance proliferation and survival in older ? cells with the goal of increasing functional ? cell mass."
"9486876","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):           Treating chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients with inhaled glucocorticosteroids has been convincingly shown to increase their risk of pneumonia, but the responsible mechanisms are undefined. Work from this laboratory suggests a possible mechanism, related to the increased numbers of cells dying by apoptosis in the lungs in COPD, especially in emphysema. Uptake of apoptotic cells (efferocytosis) suppresses the ability of alveolar macrophages (AMØ) to fight infections. By markedly increasing AMØ efferocytosis, glucocorticoids plus apoptotic cells cause greater immune defects than either stimulus alone. This effect is called glucocorticoid-augmented efferocytosis (GCAE). MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are 19-25 nucleotide-long non-coding RNAs that coordinately target large numbers of genes and reduce their protein products. Preliminary data imply that defective AMØ function is caused by down-regulation of specific miRNAs by GCAE (but not by apoptotic cells alone or glucocorticosteroids alone). The long-term goal of this project is to develop novel, inhalational treatments, based on transient over-expression of these specifically decreased miRNAs, to reverse defective AMØ immune function when COPD patients taking inhaled glucocorticoids present with community-acquired pneumonia. This project will use ex vivo investigation of AMØ from both smoke-exposed mice and human volunteers (including active smokers and patients with COPD), and an established murine model of pneumococcal pneumonia. Its immediate goals are to: (a) confirm that GCAE increases pneumococcal pneumonia risk and severity, and in the process, validate a murine model for testing strategies to reverse those defects; (b) define  GCAE-induced defects in human AMØ functionally and by whole- transcriptome analysis, identifying genes uniquely regulated by the GCAE x pneumococcus interaction; (c) validate and optimize miRNA-over-expression to reverse the adverse effects of GCAE on AMØ defensive functions. Successful completion of this project could lead to more precisely personalized therapies and better outcomes in COPD, currently the third leading cause of death in the USA, and the most expensive-to-treat chronic disease on a per-case basis among Veterans."
"9487886","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         The success of the adaptive immune system depends upon the rapid generation of effector cells and the maintenance of memory to the antigens and pathogens previously encountered. The germinal center (GC) is the site of somatic hypermutation of antibodies, antibody class switching to IgG, and a central source of memory B cells and thus is critical for effective humoral immunity. The formation of GCs within secondary lymphoid organs after challenge with protein immunizations or viral infections is driven by specialized CD4+ T follicular helper (TFH) cells that interact with antigen-specific B cells to initiate the GC. GC-dependent neutralizing antibodies (Abs) that develop are critical for viral control and defense against secondary infection and are utilized as biomarkers for the efficacy of influenza vaccines. Thus, there is a significant need to understand the pathways that lead to differentiation of TFH, GCs, and memory B cells. The cognate interactions between MHC class II positive antigen presenting cells (APC) and antigen-specific CD4+ T cells required for TFH differentiation, the GC reaction, and memory B cell development in different settings and sites remain poorly described. To address this question, we developed a series of mice with altered expression of MHC class II on dendritic cells (DCs) and B cells and examined the immune response to model protein antigens and viral infection. Our preliminary results show that: 1. TFH differentiation is a multi-step process in which conventional DCs are critical for initial priming events but B cells are necessary for imparting the epigenetic changes that mediate complete effector potential; 2. Altering the timing of secondary B cell-T cell interactions preserves the differentiation of TFH bu inhibits the GC response; 3. In contrast to current models, T cell- dependent memory B cell differentiation can be preserved in the absence of robust GC responses; 4. APC requirements for TFH differentiation are relaxed following viral infection. These results lead to our hypothesis that variable spatial and temporal control of TFH development, the germinal center reaction, and B cell memory formation can be manipulated to impact the response to viral infection or immunization. In the current proposal, we will utilize a number of murine models to dissect the APC-T cell interactions that regulate TFH differentiation and the GC response following influenza infection. First, we will define the MHCII- dependent cognate interactions that regulate clearance and protection from influenza A. Mice with limited expression of MHCII will be vaccinated against or infected with Influenza A. We will determine which APCs process and present individual T cell epitopes recognized by effector T cells and TFH and when TFH differentiation is sufficient to drive GC responses and the development of B cell memory. We hypothesize that DCs initiate TFH differentiation but secondary Ag presentation from B cells is necessary to imprint the lineage. To advance this model, we will examine genome wide histone modifications of the TFH lineage induced by different APCs. These data will generate an epigenetic and transcriptional roadmap of the humoral response and define how individual APCs synergize to fix the functional lineages. Finally, we will utilize our models to determine if pharmacologic manipulation with improved adjuvant or epigenetic modification enhances vaccination. Completion of these Aims will provide significant insight into the biology of TFH differentiation and differentiation of the germinal center and B cell memory responses during influenza vaccination and infection. We will identify cellular and molecular targets that regulate humoral immunity and protection to guide future investigations to enhance the immune response to a virus that is problematic for Veterans."

The site of the 2017 meeting was selected because of the pioneering work on leptospirosis at Massey University. The Scientific Meetings of the International Leptospirosis Society (ILS) have been the only international conferences devoted exclusively to the field of leptospirosis research. One of the strengths of the ILS Scientific Meeting is the wide range of scientific, diagnostic, and clinical expertise and interests of the attendees, all linked by a central interest in leptospirosis. A strong effort was made to develop an innovative program for the 2017 ILS Scientific Meeting including the One Health theme, which is especially relevant for this Meeting given the inextricable links between human and veterinary health for a zoonosis such as leptospirosis. A first for the 2017 conference is the offering of three workshops of three days each on epidemiology, microbiology, and genomics, representing a major training opportunity for attendees. As in past conferences, we will include speakers chosen from submitted abstracts in each of the conference's sessions.  Each of the previous International Leptospirosis Society Scientific Meetings has been highly successful, receiving high praise by attendees, forging new collaborations, providing a forum for presenting state-of-the-art research on these bacteria, and helping to set new research directions. As in previous conferences, we expect attendance at the 2017 conference to include faculty, graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, and industrial scientists. A broad spectrum of scientists representing different research interests, geographic locations, and seniority will be invited to attend. For 2017, special efforts will be made to ensure strong attendance of young investigators (graduate students, post-docs, and junior faculty), women, and underrepresented minorities. The oral and poster presentations are organized to provide many opportunities for discussion, the exchange of ideas, and development of collaborations. Funding from the National Institutes of Health is requested to partially offset the travel and registration expenses of the participating graduate students, fellows, and junior faculty members from resource poor countries."
"9543597","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Maternal-infant feeding style, defined as a mother's approach to regulating infant feeding, is a critical, potentially modifiable mediator linking povery and child obesity. Evidence has documented that poverty-related risks directly impact feeding styles and create barriers to intervention engagement. This suggests the need to address both risks and barriers to improve intervention impact. Pediatric platforms represent an opportunity to address these risks and barriers due to their ability to access low-income families with poverty-related risks beginning in early infancy. The candidate proposes a mentored support period of five years to acquire expertise in developing strategies to improve obesity prevention in the context of poverty beginning during infancy. The candidate is an Assistant Professor of Pediatrics with the long-term goal of becoming an independent clinical research investigator. This goal will be achieved through training from expert multidisciplinary mentors from the fields of developmental-behavioral pediatrics, applied developmental psychology, nutrition science and biostatistics, formal coursework and other career development activities. She will gain advanced skills in: 1) applying theoretical frameworks from developmental psychology to patient-oriented research addressing poverty-related risks; 2) state-of-the-art methodologies for assessing maternal-infant feeding interactions; 3) complex quantitative longitudinal data analysis with repeated measures; 4) qualitative research methodologies to identify barriers and facilitators of intervention engagement with low-income families; 5) intervention development and evaluation; and 6) grant writing. The practical application of these goals will be accomplished through three study aims. In Aim 1, Dr. Gross will conduct a secondary analysis of longitudinal data from a large ongoing study of an early obesity prevention intervention to systematically describe the relationships between poverty-related risks and maternal-infant feeding styles and the degree to which these styles impact caloric intake and infant weight trajectories. In Aim 2, Dr. Gross will use qualitative methodologies to inform the conceptualization and development of strategies to address poverty-related risks and barriers that can be incorporated into a behavior change intervention and integrated into a population-scalable primary care-based platform. In Aim 3, Dr. Gross will pilot test these strategies for feasibility of implementation and obtaining preliminary estimates of effect size. The successful execution of this proposal will lead to an R01 application to test the efficacy of an obesity prevention intervention that addresses poverty-related risks and barriers using a population-scalable primary care-based platform to increase responsive maternal-infant feeding styles and reduce early child obesity."
"9487883","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         SUMMARY  Alcoholic fatty liver disease (ALD) is one of the primary causes of chronic liver diseases in the United States. In particular, ALD is becoming a prevalent health issue among veterans due to an increase in obesity, diabetes, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and drug abuse in conjunction with alcohol consumption. Disturbance of circadian rhythmicity is a risk factor for the development of liver and metabolic diseases. However, the association between the liver circadian clock and ALD remains an intriguing but unexplored research area. In addition, the most advanced analytical tools, such as transcriptomics (RNA- seq) and metabolomics (GC/MS), have not been well utilized to study ALD.  Nuclear receptors are key liaisons between the molecular clock machinery and metabolic diseases. My laboratory has pioneered major discoveries in the in vivo function of small heterodimer partner (SHP, Nrob2) in hepatic bile acid and lipid metabolism. The proposed study is based on our newly discovered role of SHP in integrating the circadian clock, metabolic network, and the ER stress signaling in the liver.  The overall objective is to establish an integrated molecular circadian network in alcohol mediated ER stress response and steatosis. The central hypothesis is that ethanol-binge alters rhythmic SHP expression in the liver, which in turn modulates Npas2 and the downstream targets in the ER stress signaling and lipogenesis pathways. Specifically, we will elucidate how alcohol, SHP and Npas2 coordinately control CHOP and SREBP1c gene transcription, protein stability, and activity, and establish the modulation by alcohol of the entie liver transcriptome and metabolome. Aim #1: To elucidate a SHP and alcohol mediated molecular circadian pathway that controls ER stress signaling; Aim #2: To determine the effect of liver specific Npas2 knockdown on the ER stress response and steatosis mediated by SHP and ethanol-binge; and Aim #3: To establish hepatic circadian transcriptome and metabolome networks interlocked by SHP and ethanol-binge. In addition to our unique in vivo mouse (SHP-/-) and in vitro cell models, new liver Npas2 knockdown mice will be generated and employed for the study. Our approach makes full use of molecular biology, systems biology, and genome wide high throughput analysis (RNA-seq and GC/MS) to address an important scientific question that is directly relevant to the health of veterans.  This study is innovative both conceptually and in the implementation of experimental approaches. The planned experimental strategies are comprehensive, yet feasible. This project will uncover for the first time a novel interplay between alcohol and the liver circadian clock to control the ER stress response and hepatic lipid metabolism. The discoveries made from this study are highly likely to enable substantial advances in ALD research, making this project of high clinical significance and translational value."

Its primary role is to initiation of shoulder movement and control of the arm position in space. Rotator cuff tears (RCT) are increasingly common in the aging population, with some studies showing that up to 20% of the population greater than 50 years of age has a symptomatic RCT. Patients will symptomatic RCT have difficulties raising their arms and many of their daily activities are impaired as a result. Our VA patients are an advanced aging population, compared to general population in U.S. With the aging of our Veteran population, RCT is becoming a more and more important health issue for the VA patients. The development of muscle fibrosis and fatty infiltration (FI) are critical factors that determine the clinical outcome of patients with tis injury. It has been demonstrated that the amount of FI in rotator cuff muscles correlate with poor clinical results. There is no effective strategies currently exist to treat this pathologic change once it occurs. Recent works from multiple groups have suggested that a population of muscle progenitor cells, named fibro-adipo progenitor cells (FAPs) are responsible for muscle fibrosis and FI after direct muscle injuries. However, the role of FAPs in rotator cuff muscle pathology has not been studied. The transforming growth factor beta (TGF?) and bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling pathways have been reported to play critical roles in regulating stem cell differentiation, including fibrogenesis and adipogenesis. However, their role in regulating FAPs differentiation in rotator cuff muscle fibrosis and FI remains unknown. Better understanding of the role of these pathways in rotator cuff muscle fibrosis and fatty infiltration may lead to novel pharmacological treatment to prevent or reserve muscle pathology after RCT, thus to improve the clinical outcomes for our effect Veterans."
"9397416","Numerous cross-sectional and longitudinal studies have established that circulating levels of testosterone decline with age in men, and this decline has been associated with parallel age-related metabolic and pathophysiological changes such as increased fat mass, cardiovascular risk, and incidence of frailty, depression, osteopenia, osteoporosis, insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes and decreased muscle/bone mass, and sexual function. Likewise, aging of the human ovary also results in a gradual decline in ovarian steroid production, followed by an abrupt and complete cessation of both progesterone and estrogen production at the onset of menopause. Similarly, human aging is accompanied by a dramatic decline in adrenal androgens (DHEA, DHEAS) and alterations in cortisol and aldosterone production and secretion. Similar to humans, aging in experimental rodents is also associated with profound changes in the synthesis and secretion of steroid hormones, particularly testosterone. Moreover, most of the age-induced alterations in the testicular (testosterone) and adrenal steroid responses in experimental rodents are reflective of the response in humans. Although the various cellular and molecular mechanisms controlling this aging defect in rodents have not been unequivocally identified, recent studies mainly from this laboratory have established a causal link between increased ROS formation/excessive oxidative stress and oxidative damage (especially from life-long continued processing of cholesterol for steroid production) to the cellular machinery involved in cholesterol transport to mitochondria, resulting in attenuated cholesterol transport with consequent impairment of steroidogenesis during aging. The cytosolic Sod1peroxiredoxins (Prdx) and mitochondrial Sod2 peroxiredoxins are the most potent anti-oxidant defense systems in steroid producing cells. Our preliminary data demonstrate that the functional expression of both cytosolic and mitochondrial Sod-Prdx antioxidant axes is coordinately and robustly downregulated most likely via excessive oxidative damage during aging. Using the above information, we propose the following 3 specific aims to investigate our hypothesis that increased ROS formation/excessive oxidative stress and ensuing oxidative damage to cytosolic and mitochondrial Sod-Prdx antioxidant axes, leads to downregulation of functional expression of crucial proteins involved in cholesterol transport to (SNAREs) and within the mitochondria (StAR) for side- chain cleavage (Cyp11a1), resulting in impaired cholesterol transport to mitochondria and failed steroidogenesis. In addition, we will test the hypothesis that genetic ablation or pharmacological inhibition of oxidant-sensitive p38 MAPK will attenuate or prevent age-related decline in steroid hormone synthesis and secretion. Specific Aim 1: Examine a functional link between ROS induced impairment of expression of components of the Sod-Prdx axes and oxidative stress-induced down-regulation of SNAREs and StAR, resulting in loss of steroidogenic response during aging; Specific Aim 2: Assess the contribution of Sods and Prdx proteins in ROS-mediated inhibition/inactivation of specific SNAREs and StAR, impaired cholesterol transport to mitochondria, and inhibition of steroidogenesis in aging; and Specific Aim 3: Determine whether pharmacological inhibition or genetic ablation of p38 MAPK reverses impaired steroidogenesis during aging or in antioxidant-deficient mouse models. The planned studies involve a multi- level approach including use of state-of-the art biochemical, cell biology, and molecular biology techniques, several metabolic aging mouse and rat models, and genetically altered mice with increased or decreased expression of specific antioxidant enzymes and pharmacological intervention strategies to achieve the stated goals."
"9486840","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Diabetes is an epidemic in USA and Veterans are nearly three times as likely as the general population to have diabetes. Patients with diabetes have an increased risk of developing cardiovascular disease and more than 75 percent of them die of cardiovascular complications. Given that the prevalence of type 2 diabetes continues to increase steadily and the prevalence of CVD in patients with type 2 diabetes continues despite advances in the management of CVD, it is crucial to develop new therapeutic strategies for cardiovascular disease to reduce mortality in diabetic patients. In recent years, a large number of studies have provided strong evidence that lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-activated toll-like receptor (TLR)4 plays an important role in chronic inflammation and atherosclerosis in diabetes. Since type 2 diabetes is also associated with an increased saturated fatty acids (SFAs), we have investigated the impact of SFAs on LPS stimulated TLR4 activation in macrophages. Interestingly, we found that palmitic acid (PA), the most abundant SFAs in diabetes, amplified LPS-triggered TLR4 signaling on inflammatory gene expression in macrophages by 4-fold. We also found that acid sphingomyelinase (aSMase) plays a key role in the amplification of TLR4-mediated inflammatory signaling by PA. Overall, our recent studies have elucidated an interaction between TLR4 signaling and sphingolipid metabolic pathway: LPS and PA have a synergy on aSMase-mediated sphingomyelin hydrolysis and subsequent ceramide/sphingosine 1 phosphate (S1P) increase while the ceramide/S1P increase in turn amplifies TLR4-mediated signaling. Since all our above findings were made in vitro, it is important to confirm the observations in vivo. Thus, we proposed to determine if high-fat diet (HFD) enriched with PA and LPS administration increase atherosclerosis cooperatively via sphingolipids. We proposed animal studies to confirm our in vitro observations and studies with macrophages to explore the mechanisms involved in the synergy between PA and TLR4 signaling. Specific objective 1: To determine if HFD enriched with PA enhances the stimulatory effect of LPS on atherosclerosis in diabetic LDL receptor-deficient (LDLR-/-) mice and if aSMase plays an essential role in the enhancement. We hypothesized that HFD enriched with PA enhances LPS-induced atherosclerosis in diabetic LDLR-/- mice, and aSMase-mediated sphingolipid metabolism plays an essential role in the enhancement. Specific objective 2: To determine the mechanisms involved in the synergy of PA and LPS on S1P production and the role of S1P in IL-6 upregulation. We hypothesized that LPS and PA exert a cooperative stimulation on sphingosine kinase (SK), and S1P augments the inflammatory signal stimulated by LPS and PA by enhancing NF?B signaling. Specific objective 3: To determine the mechanisms involved in the cooperative activation of aSMase by LPS and PA. We hypothesized that LPS and PA have a cooperative stimulation on protein kinase C (PKC)?nd aSMase membrane translocation, leading to increased aSMase activity and ceramide production. METHODS: For Objective 1, systemic inflammation will be induced by administration of low dose LPS, and HFD enriched with PA will be given to LDLR-/- mice to induce diabetes. We will then determine sphingolipids, vascular inflammation and atherosclerosis using lipidomics, histology, and immunohistochemistry. We will also employ LDLR-/- mice with aSMase-deficiency to determine the role of aSMase in diabetes-accelerated atherosclerosis. For Objective 2, we will perform cell and molecular biology studies.  This study will provide novel insight into the interaction between inflammation and dyslipidemia in diabetes-accelerated atherosclerosis and is important for developing new therapeutic strategies. The incidence of diabetes in Veterans is much higher than that in general population. This research project will provide important information for developing new therapeutic strategies to prevent fatal cardiovascular events in our Veterans with diabetes."

"9486818","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     The overall hypothesis that underlies the focus of this grant proposal is that chronic TH1/classical inflammation is critical for the progression of neurodegeneration in Parkinson's disease (PD) and Gulf War Illnesses (GWI) and other neurodegenerative diseases. There is strong evidence from the literature that inflammation and oxidative damage are observed in the brains of PD patients, GWI patients and patients with other neurodegenerative diseases, however a critical question is the interaction of neurons, glia and T cells. Furthermore, there is mounting evidence that an during aging, there is development of a hostile environment that makes therapeutics that may be effective in the young animal, less effective in the aged animal. The aims of this proposal are designed to examine this process by following the progression of damage from wild-type (WT) ?-synuclein overexpressed in the substantia nigra via transduction with adeno-associated virus (AAV)9. We will study the role of inflammation in this model and determine if therapeutics effective in young animals are equally effective in the aged.  Specific Aim 1: Hypothesis: CX3CL1 (fractalkine) is a chemokine important in neuronal glial interactions. We propose that a gene therapy approach to administering CX3CL1 is viable and will be effective against rAAV9-synuclein models of PD. We will further examine interactions of chemokine signaling and T cells via IL12. CX3CL1 is a cytokine important in neuronal glial communication, however there is debate concerning which form of CX3CL1 is neuroprotective, as there are reports of neurodegenerative actions. We will continue exploring this question using 3 AAV9 constructs of CX3CL1 that have differential processing. In addition, ongoing neurodegeneration in ?-SYN models involves a complex interaction of chemokine signals that regulate both innate immune cells and T cells. We have preliminary data that one action of CX3CL1 is to reduce IL12, and important regulator of TH1 immunity.  Specific Aim 2: Hypothesis: Aging alters both the innate and adaptive immune system, thus will alter the efficacy of immune based therapies. As PD the majority of PD occurs in elderly subjects, it is critical to consider this with respect to therapeutic choices. We will examine if AAV9-CX3CL1 therapy is effective in the AAV9-?-SYN model PD in aged animals. WE know that microglia in aged rodents show predominantly M1 responses and have blunted M2 signaling. This may alter neuronal - glial-Tcell chemokine signaling. We will examine the effect of CX3CL1 treatment to alter microglial responses and interact with regulation of T cell populations.  Specific Aim 3: ?-Synuclein neurotoxicity is increased when T cells are present and depends on T cell- microglia communication via chemokines. We further predict that T cells in aged rats will have altered patterns of migration, homing and survival. Evidence is mounting that T cells play an important role in neurodegeneration in concert with microglia and other antigen presenting cells. This has not been studied extensively in models of PD involving ?-synuclein, however one study suggests a correlation. We will investigate this in the athymic nude rat, and then determine which type of T cell is involved by replacing T cell subsets individually by adoptive transfer methods."
"9486872","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):          Stroke represents a major cause of death and disability in our elderly veterans. Stroke is also a major risk factor for cognitive decline, most often due to vascular cognitive impairment. Veterans with stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) due to large-artery disease are at highest risk for early recurrence and are, therefore, most often subjected to aggressive interventions. Furthermore, large- artery disease has been recognized as an independent risk factor for cognitive impairment. The ability to predict recurrence and prognosis following stroke is crucial for developing novel prevention and treatment strategies. Current diagnostic criteria for stroke include clinical and imaging data. However, no biomarker is currently available that can reliably predict recurrence and prognosis. Lack of such knowledge limits our ability to prevent future ischemic strokes or cognitive decline.  Coated-platelets are a subset of procoagulant platelets observed after co-activation with collagen and thrombin. Coated-platelet levels are significantly higher in patients with ischemic stroke or TIA compared to unaffected controls. In addition, higher levels, measured after the initial infarct correlate with an increased risk for recurrent stroke. Among stroke patients, those with stroke due to large-artery disease and elevated coated-platelet levels have a rate of early recurrent stroke 6-7 fold higher than those with lower coated-platelet levels. Research efforts focusing on platelet biology have shown that platelet micro-RNA (miRNA) has considerable potential for deciphering mechanisms underlying differences in platelet reactivity through modulation of gene expression and protein translation. In preliminary studies, we have shown increased coated-platelet production in patients with stroke due to large-artery disease compared to patients with stroke due to cardiac causes and we have found that differences in the expression of platelet miRNA species may be linked to coated- platelet production. These findings raise the possibility that coated-platelets will serve as an additional risk stratification tool in stroke, through mechanisms that involve platelet miRNA  expression.  The research hypotheses for the current grant are: 1) Coated-platelet levels in patients with stroke/TIA due to large-artery disease are markers for prognosis and recurrence risk: higher levels indicate increased likelihood of recurrent ischemic stroke while lower levels indicate an increased likelihood of hemorrhagic complications, 2) Elevated coated-platelet levels predict the presence and progression of cognitive impairment in patients with stroke/TIA due to large-artery disease, and 3) Increased coated-platelet production is mediated through individual micro-RNAs in stroke patients.  The objective of the current application is to determine the relationship of coated-platelets to stroke due to large-artery disease. Three specific aims will test these hypotheses: 1) Determine the relationship between coated-platelets levels and prognosis in patients with stroke/TIA due to large- artery disease, 2) Test the hypothesis that elevated coated-platelets are predictive of cognitive impairment in stroke/TIA due to large-artery disease, and 3) Identify micro-RNA (miRNA) species associated with coated-platelet production. We plan to test our hypotheses in a large group of patients with stroke/TIA due to large-artery disease (N=430).  The rationale for the proposed research is that once we understand the relationship between coated-platelets and cerebrovascular disease we will be able to improve health care delivery for our veterans with stroke through individualized risk assessment strategies and to identify potential targets for novel pharmacological interventions that involve miRNA-mediated platelet reactivity."
"9397424","Bladder cancer is the fourth most common cancer in men and a significant burden for Veterans and the VHA due to the high frequency of recurrence and progression linked to smoking and exposure to deployment- related carcinogens. Nearly 80% of bladder cancers do not invade the muscle of the bladder wall (called ?non- muscle invasive bladder cancer?, NMIBC) but the most aggressive of these tumors will progress to muscle invasion with lymph node metastasis resulting in death in 30% of patients. The primary cause of death from bladder cancer is resistance to therapy as these invasive carcinomas acquire cellular plasticity and stem cell- like properties. Identification of mechanisms that regulate this change in cellular differentiation This invasive phenotype is a hallmark of cancer and a major shift in differentiation regulated by both genetic mutations and epigenetic cellular reprogramming. The long-term goal of our research is to investigate the molecular and epigenetic pathways driving invasion of bladder cancer. By understanding these mechanisms, we may develop rational and novel therapeutics for patients with bladder cancer. To investigate the epigenetic mechanisms that contribute to invasion and proliferation as a feasible target for bladder cancer, we evaluated the histone methyltransferase Enhancer of Zeste-2 (EZH2), as part of the polycomb repressor complex-2 (PRC-2) in bladder cancer. Our preliminary data demonstrate increased expression of EZH2 and its histone target, H3K27me3, in a carcinogen-induced mouse model of bladder cancer. In multiple bladder cancer cell lines, EZH2 expression is increased compared to non-transformed urothelial cells. Destabilization of the PRC-2 complex stops cellular proliferation. Consistent with our findings, bioinformatics analysis of multiple human bladder cancer databases demonstrate that EZH2 is overexpressed in invasive bladder cancers, which we have confirmed in tumor specimens from patients with all stages of bladder cancer. Given this preliminary data, our central hypothesis is that EZH2 drives invasion of bladder cancer by causing global changes in histone methylation that shifts cellular identity to an invasive and stem cell-like phenotype via an epithelial to mesenchymal transition. Thus, given our promising preliminary data, we propose to investigate our hypothesis with the following Specific Aims: 1) Determine the role of EZH2 in bladder cancer initiation and progression; 2) Investigate aberrant histone methylation of EMT, invasive and stem cell genes by EZH2 in bladder cancer; 3) Evaluate pharmacologic inhibition of EZH2 as a treatment for bladder cancer. Currently, we have no personalized genetic or epigenetic targets for bladder cancer and our best therapy for non-muscle invasive bladder cancer is > 40 years old. Through multi-disciplinary collaboration we have demonstrated feasibility with our approach. Successful completion of the studies described in this proposal will provide an innovative approach to both investigate the mechanisms involved in the invasion of bladder cancer and utilize a novel therapeutic approach to treat bladder cancer. These EZH2-targeted agents overcome the challenge of cellular resistance and have pre-clinical investigations that will allow access to Veterans with bladder cancer."
"9487124","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):          Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is an important health concern for veterans, due to its high incidence and frequent poor response to treatment. Notably, internal tandem duplication (ITD) mutations of the fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) receptor tyrosine kinase genes are present AML cells in a third of AML patients and are associated with rapid relapse following chemotherapy. FLT3 inhibitors have activity, but responses are limited and transient.  Pim-1 kinase is a serine threonine kinase that is expressed in AML cells and is overexpressed downstream of FLT3-ITD in AML cells with this molecular abnormality. Pim-1 kinase regulates diverse proteins involved in proliferation, cell cycle, apoptosis and drug resistance, including, among others, c-MYC, the pro-apoptotic protein Bad and the anti-apoptotic protein Mcl-1, and is also implicated in DNA repair. We demonstrated that Pim-1 also phosphorylates FLT3 and promotes its aberrant signaling in a positive feedback loop in FLT3-ITD AML cells, and that Pym kinase inhibitors sensitize FLT3-ITD AML cells to apoptosis induction by FLT3 inhibitors. We then found that Pim kinase inhibitors also sensitize FLT3-ITD AML cells to apoptosis induction by chemotherapy drugs used to treat AML. Pim-1 substrate proteins are also expressed in key pathways in AML stem cells, and Pim-1 phosphorylation of these proteins may protect AML stem cells from the effects of chemotherapy and of FLT3 inhibitors. Pim kinase inhibitors are in current preclinical and clinical development.  1. The overall hypotheses of this grant proposal is that Pim-1 plays a key role in resistance of FLT3-ITD AML to available treatments, and that inhibition of Pim kinase will improve treatment outcomes in FLT3-ITD AML by abrogating multiple mechanisms of drug resistance and of disease progression. The Specific Aims of the proposed work are: 1. To determine the mechanisms by which Pim kinase inhibition sensitizes FLT3-ITD AML cells to induction of apoptosis by chemotherapy drugs and by FLT3 inhibitors; 2. To optimize scheduling of administration of Pim kinase inhibitors, chemotherapy drugs and by FLT3 inhibitors in FLT3-ITD AML; and 3. To test the effects of in vivo administration of Pim kinase inhibitors with chemotherapy drugs and with FLT3 inhibitors on FLT3-ITD AML cells and AML stem cells and on normal hematopoietic cells.  The effects of Pim-1 kinase inhibition will be studied in AML cell lines and patient samples using both in vitro culture systems and an in vivo model. In Aim 1, we will test the hypotheses that Pim kinase inhibition sensitizes FLT3-ITD cells to apoptosis by inhibiting FLT3-ITD signaling, altering expression and activation of pro- and anti-apoptotic proteins, promoting generation of reactive oxygen species and/or inhibiting repair of DNA damage. Mechanistic insights achieved in Aim 1 will guide design of scheduling of Pim kinase inhibition in relation to exposure to chemotherapy drugs and to FLT3 inhibitors. Approaches to scheduling will be tested in vitro, with apoptosis as the readout. In addition, effects of Pim kinase inhibition on cell cycle could result in kinetic resistance to drugs, and notably cytarabine, and will be tested. Finally, effects on normal hematopoietic cells will be studied to establish a therapeutic index. In Aim 3, strategies optimized in vitro in Aim 2 will be tested in vivo an immunodeficient mouse model. It is anticipated that the proposed work will lead to development and optimization of regimens incorporating Pim kinase inhibitors in the treatment of FLT3-ITD AML, with the goal of improved outcomes in this unfavorable AML subset..."
"9487906","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Stroke (focal cerebral ischemia) is a leading cause of death and disability in aging Veterans. Furthermore, many aged Veterans also suffer from neurodegenerative disorders. The mechanisms that contribute to secondary brain damage and neurological dysfunction after stroke are not completely understood. Preliminary studies of this proposal show induction of a-Synuclein expression in the brains of rodents subjected to focal ischemia. As a-Synuclein is thought to be a major contributor of neuronal death in Parkinson Disease and other chronic neurodegenerative diseases, the present proposal will test the hypothesis a-Synuclein is a contributor of post-stroke brain damage. This hypothesis will be tested by the following Specific Aims:  Aim 1 is to evaluate the functional significance of a-Synuclein in promoting secondary brain damage and neurological dysfunction following experimental stroke using a-Synuclein siRNA-mediated knockdown and a-Synuclein knockout mice as alternate approaches.  Aim 2 is to evaluate if down-regulation of microRNA miR-7a is responsible for a-Synuclein protein induction in the post-ischemic brain. We will test if restoring miR-7a levels with a miR mimic curtails a- synuclein mediated post-ischemic secondary brain damage and neurological dysfunction.  Aim 3 is to identify if a-Synuclein induced after stroke mediates secondary brain damage by modulating inflammation, oxidative stress, apoptosis, mitochondrial fission, and autophagy. We will test if a- Synuclein knockdown curtails these post-ischemic pathophysiological mechanisms and thus decreases post-ischemic brain damage.  Aim 4 is to test the role of post-translational modifications of a-Synuclein in ischemic brain damage. We will specifically study ser-129 phosphorylation which is thought to promote a-Synuclein oligomerization and toxicity and lysine ubiquitination which is thought to be important for a-Synuclein degradation by lysosomes.  Aim 5 is to study the long-term implications of a-Synuclein induction after stroke. This is important as a- Synuclein accumulation and toxicity occur over decades in chronic neurodegenerative conditions; whereas a-Synuclein increases rapidly within hours after stroke. Overall, the present project will serve as a bridge to understan the role of a-Synuclein and to design novel therapies based on a-Synuclein and miRNA-7a to minimize the post-stroke brain damage in Veterans. Relevance of the proposed work to the VA patient care mission: Every year, >7,000 Veterans suffer new strokes and there are >80,000 surviving Veterans with stroke-induced neurological dysfunction. The negative impact of this devastating disease on Veterans increases enormously in the near future unless the molecular mechanisms of post-stroke brain damage are deciphered and therapies are developed based on the new targets. a-Synuclein is an attractive target to curtail post-stroke brain damage as many resources are already available from the ongoing research on Parkinson Disease. Successful completion of the proposed studies to evaluate the significance of a-Synuclein after stroke helps the recovery of surviving stroke sufferers among Veterans."
"9487898","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Cancers of the renal cortex are known as renal cell carcinomas (RCC) and represent ~80-85% of all primary renal neoplasms. The clear cell variant comprises up to 85% of all RCCs, which are expected to result in ~64,000 new cases and ~14,000 deaths in the U.S. in 2014. Clear cell RCC is a disease that increases with age and is more common in men, and as such represents a common source of cancer-related morbidity and mortality amongst our Veterans. The disease is lethal at the advanced, metastatic stage. Although several novel treatments, including small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors and rapamycin analogs, have received regulatory approval, their overall impact on survival is modest, and median survival for patients with metastatic clear cell RCC remains at only ~24 months.  The molecular hallmark of hereditary and sporadic clear cell RCC is the biallelic inactivation of the vonHippel-Lindau (VHL) tumor suppressor gene, which is most well characterized for its role as the substrate recognition unit of an E3 ubiquitin ligase that targets hypoxia-inducible factor alpha (HIF?) for proteasomemediated degradation. Importantly, upwards of 90% of sporadic cases of clear cell RCC manifest VHL inactivation. Although restoration of the expression pVHL, the protein product of the VHL gene, suppresses tumorigenesis as does inhibition of HIF? expression, gene replacement therapy and the development of small molecule inhibitors of transcription factors such as HIF? s not readily feasible for clinical translation. The overarching goal of our proposed research is to validate HIF?-independent effects of VHL loss as viable therapeutic targets for clear cell RCC. Specifically, we propose to generate the pre-clinical data to establish that a MAP kinase kinase kinase known as transforming growth factor ? activated kinase (TAK1), which is hyperactivated in response to pVHL deficiency, is a suitable target for drug development and translation into the clinic. We have already established that TAK1 drives the activation of the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-?B) pathways, both of which are pro-tumorigenic and constitutively activated in pVHL-deficient RCCs. Thus, our hypothesis is that TAK1 inhibition represents a potential therapeutic target that mediates renal oncogenesis through downstream activation of the NF-?B and JNK pathways. Based on this background and our preliminary studies, many of which have been published, we have proposed three aims:  Aim 1. To establish that TAK1 inhibition prevents and retards the growth of pVHL-deficient RCCs in vitro and in vivo.  Aim 2. To elucidate the underlying molecular mechanisms that are permissive for concurrent, constitutive activation of the NF-?B and JNK pathways in pVHL-deficient cells.  Based on preliminary studies, we postulate that molecular adaptations acquired by pVHL-deficient RCCs are critical to the ongoing, constitutive JNK activation that characterizes pVHL-deficient cells.  Aim 3. To establish that constitutive TAK1 and concurrent NF-?B and JNK activation occur in clear cell RCC patient specimens. As a critical component to the process of pre-clinical validation of a molecular target, it is vital to confirm that the relevant pathways ar indeed activated in patient specimens in a fashion that is consistent with our pre-clinical models. Successful execution of the proposed aims will lay the groundwork for the validation of TAK1, a druggable kinase that is hyperactivated as a consequence of VHL loss, as a molecular target for clinical development. In this fashion, our long-term goal is to translate our findings to the management of advanced clear cell RCC, a relatively common malignancy amongst our Veterans."
"9486893","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):           Due to sustained military conflicts in Afghanistan and Iraq over the past decade, there are an increasing number of U.S. military personnel and Veterans returning home with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and comorbid alcohol use disorders (AUD). If left untreated, Veterans with co-occurring PTSD and substance use disorders are at increased risk for developing other mental health problems (e.g., depression, anxiety), suicidal ideation and attempts, physical health problems, reduced resiliency and military readiness, employment problems, violence, and family/relationship impairment. While mental health services are in place for U.S. service members, substantial gaps in the treatment of co-occurring PTSD and AUD exist and there is little scientific evidence available to guide the provision of care. The proposed study directly addresses this critical knowledge gap by testing the efficacy of doxazosin, a long-acting and selective alpha-1 adrenergic antagonist, as compared to placebo in reducing PTSD and AUD severity among U.S. military personnel who have served in Operation Enduring Freedom, Operation Iraqi Freedom, or Operation New Dawn (OEF/OIF/OND). The most common substance use disorder among Veterans is alcohol use disorder (AUD); thus the proposed study targets Veterans with co-occurring PTSD and AUD. The medication to be investigated (doxazosin) represents a novel treatment approach for PTSD/AUD. While prazosin, also an alpha-1 adrenergic antagonist, has been shown to improve sleep and nightmares in military personnel with PTSD and may help reduce substance use severity, it has a short half-life of 2-3 hours and requires multiple doses each day, which is a significant limitation. In several pilot studies, doxazosin has shown promise in significantly reducing symptoms of PTSD and AUD and, in contrast to prazosin, it requires once per day dosing which confers a significant advantage in terms of translating positive findings into routine clinical practice. In this Stage I study, we will (1) employ a two-arm randomized, double-blind, between-groups experimental design that will consist of 12 weeks of treatment with doxazosin or placebo medication; (2) use standardized, repeated dependent measures to rigorously assess PTSD symptomatology and AUD severity at 5 time points (baseline, week 4, week 8, week 12 and 1-month follow-up); (3) measure impairment in associated mental and behavioral health problems (e.g., depression, anxiety, sleep, risky behaviors, family/social functioning); and (4) use functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate the underlying pathophysiology of comorbid PTSD/AUD and identify prognostic indicators of treatment outcome. To achieve these aims, we have assembled a multidisciplinary team of investigators with nationally-recognized expertise in combat-related PTSD, substance use disorders and neuroimaging who have successfully collaborated in the past and are uniquely qualified to implement this type of investigation. The investigators represent a collaboration of faculty at the Ralph H. Johnson Veterans Affairs (VA) Medical Center and the Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC) in Charleston, SC. The proposed project is directly responsive to the mission of the Consortium to Alleviate PTSD (CAP) in that it seeks to enhance and accelerate research on the treatment of early, chronic and latent onset PTSD and common comorbidities such as AUD. The findings of this study will provide critically needed empirical evidence to help inform clinical practice guidelines and better  serve the needs of U.S. service members, Veterans and their families."
"9378728","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):          Suicide is a leading cause of death among U.S. Veterans. Therefore, understanding the etiological basis for the risk of suicide is of dire importance to our Veteran population. Stress i a crucial factor in risk of suicide. Specifically for Veterans, exposure to traumatic environmental events during combat, military service, or post- deployment stressful situations related to readjustment to civilian life are key contributors to the increase risk of suicide. These stressors  can affect the diathesis for suicidal acts and can serve as triggers or precipitants of suicidal acts. Biological markers or stable behavioral traits for suicide risk factors likely interact in a complex manner that might benefit from approaches that can examine gene by environment interactions. Epigenetics is the bridge, connecting environment with genetics, by mediating the influence of environmental factors such as stress in altered regulation of gene expression related to suicide. We will investigate DNA methylation patterns associated with suicide risk in Veterans undergoing psychiatric treatment at the JJP VAMC using a genome- scale approach. Additionally, through subsequent follow-up studies, we will assess how DNA methylation patterns are altered following treatment. Such a longitudinal study is unprecedented and provides an opportunity to identify biological markers of suicide risk and treatment response. Moreover, the role of the inflammatory response in the stress diathesis in suicide risk will also be investigated in these studies. Together the epigenetic and inflammatory markers of suicide risk and treatment will identify objective measures that we can use in clinical settings to identif Veterans at risk of suicide and to determine the efficacy of treatment course and response."
"9486879","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a growing public health problem that currently affects more than 500 million people worldwide. Given the growth of major risk factors, including obesity, hypertension and diabetes mellitus (DM), the prevalence of CKD and its consequences will continue to expand. In addition to the risk of progressing to end stage renal disease, patients with CKD suffer from premature death due to cardiovascular disease (CVD). The mortality rates in advanced CKD are six times higher than the Medicare population. Emerging data over the past decade suggest a critical role of non-traditional risk factors in the pathogenesis of CVD. These risk factors include obesity and insulin resistance (IR)-two elements not currently targeted by standard therapies. A significant knowledge gap exists detailing the main determinants of IR in this population, how to optimally characterize this derangement, and whether it can be effectively modified to improve outcomes in this population. The pathophysiology of insulin resistance in CKD is unique. In addition to a high prevalence of obesity (nearly 50%), patients with CKD have important metabolic derangements, such as decreased clearance of insulin and adipokines, metabolic acidosis, and chronic inflammation, that modify the pathophysiology of insulin resistance. Adipose tissue is an endocrine organ that secretes adipokines which include, but are not limited to, adiponectin and leptin.6 These two adipokines have opposing actions. Adiponectin is a key insulin sensitizing hormone with anti-atherogenic effects. In contrast, leptin is atherogenic and promotes insulin resistance. Leptin to adiponectin ratio (LAR) has been proposed as an atherogenic index in diabetes and has been shown to be a sensitive marker of metabolic syndrome. Furthermore, LAR has been shown to be the best correlate of IR in end stage renal disease patients. Given the high prevalence of obesity and metabolic derangements associated with CKD, detailing the interaction between these two conditions and their effect on CV risk is critical. The overarching aim of this proposal is to understand the effect of these interactions on adipokine imbalances and the generation of insulin resistance, and the combination of these effects on vascular health. Novel biomarkers, including imbalances in adipokine profiles, will be tested for their ability to risk stratify patiets. Finally, interventions directed at adipokine dysregulation and insulin resistance will be tested fo its ability to reverse this high risk profile in patients with moderate CKD. Our specific aims are s follows: 1) To characterize the metabolic disturbances that arise from the intersection of increased adiposity and decreased clearance of insulin and adipokines in obese patients with moderate CKD, 1a) To compare the extent of IR using hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp (HEGC) studies between patients with and without CKD and the degree to which this is modified by obesity, 1b) To examine if LAR will more appropriately reflect the metabolic state of obesity in the setting of moderate CKD compared to conventional measures of insulin resistance validated against HEGC, 1c) To determine if LAR is a determinant of inflammation, endothelial function, oxidative stress and atherosclerosis in the setting of obesity in CKD; 2) To study the effects of metformin, an AMP-K activator, on the metabolic disturbances associated with CKD and obesity, i.e. insulin resistance, systemic inflammation and oxidative stress, 2a) To test if metformin will improve LAR in obese CKD patients compared to placebo, 2b) To test if metformin will improve markers of systemic inflammation, oxidative stress and endothelial function in this population compared to placebo. 2c) To test if metformin will improve atherosclerosis markers and reduce clinical CVD events in obese patients with moderate CKD compared to placebo. Our proposed studies could potentially impact clinical practice, by providing new monitoring tools and potential targets for intervention to reduce CV mortality in CKD patients. Our study results could have a great impact on VETERANS HEALTH CARE and contribute to the research mission of the Department of Veterans Health administration by improving the care we provide to veteran patients with CKD."
"9486816","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Risk factors for anxiety disorder are important in determining who ultimately develops the disorder. However, our understanding of risk factors is rudimentary. Identification of the mechanisms of risk factors would be a step forward in understanding the etiology of anxiety disorders. Reduced hippocampal volume, dysfunction of the brain-derived neurotrophin factor (BDNF) system and behavioral inhibition temperament are three anxiety risk factors identified in humans. The risk factor of reduced hippocampal volume is associated with impaired hippocampal-dependent learning, suggesting impaired hippocampal synaptic plasticity in individuals at risk. BDNF is important for synaptic plasticity. Thus, we hypothesize that impaired hippocampal synaptic plasticity may underlie the risk factors of both reduced hippocampal volume and BDNF dysfunction. The Wistar Kyoto (WKY) rat is an inbred strain that is stress sensitive, has a reduced hippocampal volume compared to the outbred Sprague Dawley (SD) rat, has an abnormal BDNF system and expresses a behavioral inhibition. In addition, WKY rats acquire active avoidance to a greater and more persistent degree than SD rats. Abnormal avoidance is a core feature of all anxiety disorders, and the development of abnormal avoidance parallels the trajectory of PTSD (cluster C). Thus, the proposed studies will test whether impaired synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus contributes to the development of abnormal avoidance learning in the presence and absence of behavioral inhibition temperament. Four aims are proposed. Aim 1 will determine whether BDNF-induced synaptic plasticity is impaired in the hippocampus of WKY rats and if NMDA and BDNF agonists can attenuate these impairments. Aim 2 will investigate the effects of drugs acting on NMDA and BDNF-TrkB receptors on avoidance learning. Aim 3 will determine if opioid-dependent LTP in the hippocampus is impaired in WKY rats. Opioid-dependent LTP does not require NMDA or TrkB receptors. Aim 4 will investigate whether drugs acting on opioid receptors can affect the development of abnormal avoidance responding. Because opioid-dependent LTP is independent of NMDA and TrkB receptors, the comparison of opioid LTP to NMDA- and BDNF-LTP will determine whether the development of abnormal avoidance requires impairment of a specific type of LTP (i.e., NMDA) or if impairment to any of the various forms of LTP in the hippocampus can lead to the development of abnormal avoidance. The proposed studies will start to elucidate the mechanisms and interactions of three risk factors for anxiety disorders. Understanding the etiology of anxiety disorders and mechanisms of risk factors will help in the development of treatments. This is especially important to the health of veterans because a significant number of veterans are likely to develop anxiety-related disorders as a result of the extreme stress associated with combat service."
"9494763","ABSTRACT The goal of this project is to facilitate the development and evaluation of statistical methods for identifying and characterizing the genetic contribution to complex diseases and their precursors and risk factors. We propose to pursue this goal by continuing the organization of the Genetic Analysis Workshops (GAWs), which began in 1982. The Genetic Analysis Workshops are a collaborative effort among genetic epidemiologists and statistical geneticists to evaluate and compare genetic analysis methods. For each GAW, topics are chosen for their relevance to current analytical issues in genetic epidemiology, and sets of real and computer-simulated data are distributed to investigators worldwide. Participants submit the results of their analyses, which are discussed and compared at a 3 1/2 day meeting. Participation at GAWs has increased tremendously, from fewer than 30 at GAW1 in 1982 to 272 at GAW17. In the current grant period GAW16 (2008) and GAW17 (2010) were held. The GAW17 proceedings are currently in press with publication anticipated in December 2011 and planning for GAW18 has begun. During the proposed grant period, the GAW18 Proceedings will be published and two GAWs will be held: GAW19 (in 2014) and GAW20 (in 2017). Before the Workshops, participants devote months to data analysis, communicate with others who have done similar types of analyses, and plan integrated presentations. The GAW submissions invariably contain new ideas for methods to handle complex phenotypes and a number of widely used analytical techniques had their start at a GAW. Recent GAWs have included genome-wide association data and exome sequence data, giving participants an opportunity to try out new methods for localizing and characterizing variants influencing disease risk. Topics for future GAWs will be selected from among currently challenging analytical problems. Suggestions from GAW participants include methods for analyzing whole genome sequence; genome-wide methylation profiles; comparisons of study designs for next generation sequencing projects; analyzing sequence data in admixed populations; gene-environment and gene-gene interactions; and copy number variation. We also will continue to distribute real and simulated data from past GAWs with the permission of the data providers. Long after each GAW is over, investigators continue to use GAW data sets to evaluate new analytical methods and software, to estimate power and false positive rates, and to demonstrate the feasibility of statistical techniques for finding disease genes. GAW data are extensively used in grant proposals and in teaching and dissertation research."

"9487902","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Burkholderia cepacia complex are emerging as an important group of drug resistant pathogens. The increasing number of infections in immunocompromised patients raises significant concern as antibiotic development continues to lag and our understanding of this unique pathogen still remains undeveloped. Overcoming antibiotic resistance in this genetically highly complex organism possessing multiple chromosomes is a significant medical and scientific challenge. Our main objective is to identify novel ways of overcoming ß-lactamase-mediated resistance in these and other Gram-negative pathogens. Our previous studies investigating Pen-like ß-lactamases in Burkholderia spp. lead us to postulate that a novel diazabicyclooctane (DBO) ß-lactamase inhibitor, avibactam, possesses the correct chemical features to efficiently inactivate PenA. Based upon this chemistry, we will show why avibactam works while clavulanate, sulbactam and tazobactam do not. In addition, strong preliminary evidence we have obtained leads us to hypothesize that the altered regulation of ß-lactamases (i.e., blapen and blaampC,) by LysR-type transcriptional regulators (LTTRs) (i.e., PenRA and PenRB) in B. cepacia complex is a critical determinant in ß-lactam resistance. To address these hypotheses, we will use our knowledge of structure-function relationships of PenA ß-lactamase to understand the mechanism of inactivation by avibactam and we will employ new genetic and biochemical approaches to dissect the regulation of ß-lactamase-mediated resistance in B. cepacia complex focusing on the PenRA and PenRB. Studying the pathway to inactivation by avibactam will entail detailed biochemical and mechanistic analyses. Unravelling the complex regulation of PenA ß-lactamase expression in B. cepacia complex will require us to use the lessons learned from Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterobacter spp. to understand the steps needed. To address these objectives, the biochemical inhibitory parameters of avibactam will be determined against PenA focusing on key active site residues (i.e., S130, E166, N170, R220, T237, and E276) and obtain a crystal structure of avibactam in the active site of PenA. The in vitro activity of the ceftazidime-avibactam will be assessed against diverse panel of clinical isolates of B. cepacia complex. Next, RNA-seq will be used to define the transcriptome of PenRA and PenRB. PenRA and PenRB from Burkholderia multivorans and Burkholderia cenocepacia, the two most clinically prevalent B. cepacia complex pathogens, will be cloned expressed, and purified. We will assess binding of transcription regulators to DNA and measure ß-lactamase induction. Finally, we will use site-directed mutagenesis to mutate positions 102, 103, 135, 221, and 264 of PenRA and PenRB and assess the impact of these changes on bla expression. We expect to show that this novel DBO inhibitor will inactivate PenA and that new mechanistic insights will be obtained against this carbapenemase as well as other difficult to inhibit ß-lactamases. We also anticipate that we will unravel the biochemical features of PenRA and PenRB that are necessary for the transcriptional regulation of bla expression in B. cepacia complex. Ultimately, our long term goal is to identify druggable sites on PenRA and PenRB. LTTRs may serve as a novel targets for therapies in Burkholderia spp. and other Gram-negatives. Achieving our objectives will impact the field by increasing the general understanding needed to identify novel antibiotic targets within problematic Gram-negatives."
"9378381","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):          A decade ago, (pro)renin receptor (PRR) was cloned as a new component of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) with the capability to bind prorenin and renin to increase their catalytic activity. Soluble PRR (sPRR) is derived from the extracellular domain after cleavage by furin or ADMA19. Within the kidney, PRR is predominantly expressed in the collecting duct (CD) where its expression is elevated by AngII. Preliminary studies employing a novel PRR decoy peptide PRO20 demonstrated that intramedullary antagonism of PRR in rats produced remarkable attenuation of AngII-induced hypertension, renal medullary ?-ENaC expression, and kidney injury, in parallel with suppressed renal medullary renin response and urinary aldosterone excretion. Strikingly, after adrenalectomy, this treatment suppressed urinary aldosterone excretion to undetectable level in AngII-infused rats, indicating a dominant role of PRR in nonadrenal aldosterone synthesis in the kidney. In vitro studies provide strong evidence for a direct action of PRR/sPRR in regulation of ENaC activity and aldosterone release from cultured CD cells. Based on these results, we hypothesize that during AngII infusion, PRR expression is increased in the CD where it triggers the local renin/aldosterone response, leading to ENaC activation and hence hypertension. To define the functional role of PRR in the CD, we propose to produce CD-specific deletion of PRR and study its impact on AngII-induced hypertension, target organ damage, local renin/aldosterone response, and ENaC activation in vivo and in vitro. We employ intramedullary infusion and conditional gene targeting techniques to evaluate the contribution of CD ENaC to AngII-induced hypertension. Lastly, we will evaluate urinary sPRR as a biomarker and further study the functional role and mechanism of sPRR in regulation of CD Na+ transport and blood pressure. The current proposal is expected to offer new insight into the role of CD PRR in the pathogenesis of hypertension and kidney injury."
"9378397","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):          Mortality from chronic infectious diseases, including Hepatitis C, HIV, and tuberculosis, remains a major problem among Veterans, making the development of new vaccines an important priority of biomedical research. Immunologic memory is a cardinal feature of adaptive immunity and an important goal of vaccination strategies. Traditional vaccination strategies are very effective at generating neutralizing antibodies against bacteria and viruses. However, a vaccine capable of generating robust T cell memory is still beyond our research, due, in part, to an incomplete understanding of the molecular basis for memory lymphocyte fate specification. Moreover, the molecular mechanisms underlying immune `exhaustion,' a state in which T cells are rendered ineffective during many chronic viral infections, remain incompletely understood. Thus, a fundamental understanding of how memory lymphocyte fate is specified, as well as what goes awry in the exhausted state, is a crucial first step in rational vaccine design for infectious diseases such as HIV, HCV, malaria, and tuberculosis. Our underlying hypothesis is that previously unappreciated molecular determinants control the specification of terminal effector and memory (TCM, TEM, and TRM) cell fates as well as the exhausted CD8+ T cell state. Our goal is to identify and validate these determinants using innovative multi-disciplinary approaches that include single-cell RNA sequencing, computational analyses, and immunological techniques."
"9397415","Homeostatic survival of B lymphocytes is carefully regulated, and disruption of this regulation is an important factor in pathogenesis of various autoimmune diseases and B cell malignancies. The latter are the most common hematologic cancers in the US population as well as in Veterans, in whom age/gender status, as well as exposures related to their service, can increase risk of B cell cancers. The signaling adapter protein TRAF3 plays an important, B-cell-specific role in restraining homeostatic survival and B cell activation. B cell TRAF3 deficiency in a mouse model causes abnormally high B cell survival that results in accumulation and infiltration of multiple organs and tissue with B cells, autoantibody production, and predisposition to B cell tumors. In humans, mutations of the TRAF3 gene are now recognized as common in B cell lymphoma and multiple myeloma. The proposed project will address the hypothesis that functional TRAF3 deficiency can also be caused by cellular events leading to TRAF3 membrane sequestration and/or degradation. Thus, TRAF3- regulated B cell survival abnormalities can contribute to an even higher proportion of malignancies than just those with genetic TRAF3 mutations. The proposed project will also build upon new information acquired during the most recent funding period, identifying B cell survival pathways regulated by TRAF3. The goals of the project are to determine how cellular signaling results in functional TRAF3 deficiency in B cells, and to identify TRAF3-regulated targetable B cell survival pathways, in both model systems and samples of human B cell malignancies, via the following Specific Aims: 1) Determine the mechanisms and impact of TRAF3- receptor interactions and TRAF3 deficiency on TRAF3-regulated B cell survival pathways. 2) Identify drugs/compounds effective in selectively blocking the abnormally enhanced viability of TRAF3-deficient B cells. 3) Define the association between TRAF3 status and B cell survival pathways, in human B cell malignancies. The expected outcomes of the proposed project are an accurate and detailed understanding of how B cell survival is regulated by TRAF3-mediated pathways, how key pathways can be targeted to counteract enhanced survival of TRAF3-deficient B cells, and how TRAF3 status is related to phenotype in BCL and MM. This knowledge is expected to provide valuable information to inform the best selection of therapeutic options and strategies to prevent and treat drug resistance and recurrence in human B cell malignancies."
"9378697","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):          Depression is among the most common, disabling, and expensive disorders afflicting our nation's veterans. Cellular and molecular studies of circadian (ca. 24 hr) biological clocks have recently provided tantalizing clues that clock defects may be involved not just in sleep disorders but in a wide range of clinical maladies, including mood disorders. Objectives: Our long-term goal is to define the precise relationship between genetically determined cellular circadian clock function and human mood dysregulation. Our overall hypothesis is that normal mood regulation requires proper circadian timing within brain circuits, and that mood disorders are therefore associated with dysfunction of the circadian clock at a cellular level. We hypothesize that vulnerability to mood disorders arises from clock defects not in the hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), the brain's master circadian pacemaker, but rather in the nucleus accumbens (NAc), a brain region implicated in mood regulation that contains a separate circadian clock. Our specific hypotheses are that: (1) circadian clocks are weak in human cells from depressed patients, (2) circadian clocks are also weak in NAc neurons in a mouse model of depression, and (3) weak circadian clocks in the NAc can increase vulnerability to depression in mice by removing normal daily cyclic repression of the CREB signaling pathway by the clock protein CRY. Specifically, we aim to test for circadian dysfunction in skin cells from depressed patients and in neurons from mice exhibiting depression-like behavior. We will then test whether manipulating the circadian clock or CREB signaling in NAc cells of mice alters their vulnerability to depression-like behavior. Research Design & Methodology: We will use viral vectors to introduce a firefly luciferase circadian reporter gene into human skin cells obtained by our collaborators. We will then monitor circadian rhythms of cell bioluminescence by luminometry and single-cell imaging, and analyze comprehensively the functioning of the clock, as well as expression levels of core clock genes. Next, we will use behaviorally induced learned helplessness as a mouse model of depression. Mice will harbor a bioluminescent circadian reporter, allowing us to test circadian clock function in NAc neuronal cells as we did in human cells. We will also measure levels of core clock gene expression and CREB activity in NAc brain slices, expecting to find low Cry expression and high P-CREB. Finally, we will manipulate clock or CREB function in mouse NAc by injection of various inhibitory RNAs or CREB constructs, respectively, followed by testing vulnerability to induced learned helplessness. We expect that weakening NAc rhythms by Cry knockdown, but not by knockdown of a different clock gene, will increase vulnerability to learned helplessness, and that selectively reducing CREB function at dawn, by properly phased rhythmic expression of a dominant-negative CREB construct, will be optimal for reducing vulnerability. Clinical Relationships: Our goal is an improved understanding of the relationship between neuronal circadian clocks and depression. This project may lead to improved diagnostic and therapeutic approaches to mood disorders, which are major afflictions and sources of disability for veterans."
"9283288","Project Summary / Abstract  Antibody-mediated mechanisms leading to acute and chronic renal allograft injury and loss remain poorly  understood. Investigation into these mechanisms is hampered by the lack of appropriate animal models to  study the development of allograft injury as the donor-specific antibody (DSA) response is initiated and  increases. We have developed a novel model of antibody-mediated rejection (AMR) of renal allografts in  CCR5-/- recipients where the titers of DSA elicited in response to complete MHC-mismatched renal allografts  are >50-fold higher than those elicited in wild-type recipients. The renal allografts are acutely rejected by this  antibody response in CCR5-/- recipients between days 17 and 22 with heavy deposition of C3d, peritubular  edema, and neutrophil and macrophage infiltration and activation including production of myeloperoxidase  (MPO), histopathologic features of rejection that are characteristic of those observed during AMR in clinical  transplants. These and our preliminary results have led us to propose the hypothesis that a key mechanism  underlying acute and chronic AMR of renal allografts is the induced infiltration and activation of neutrophils and  macrophages in the graft, which directly cause the acute and chronic graft tissue injury and increase the target  antigens of the recipient antibody response. This hypothesis will be tested in three specific aims. In Specific  Aim 1 we will identify and test the role of MPO-producing cells during antibody-mediated acute rejection of  renal allografts in CCR5-/- recipients. In Specific Aim 2 we will test the role of neutrophil and macrophage  mediated allograft tissue damage in the generation of donor MHC- and autoantigen-specific antibodies in  response to renal allografts. In Specific Aim 3 we will use a B cell depletion strategy to test the molecular  mechanisms leading to the development of antibody-mediated interstitital fibrosis and tubular atrophy in the  renal allografts. These studies will utilize novel models of antibody-mediated acute and chronic renal allograft  injury to provide new insights into mechanisms underlying these pathologies that remain a major problem  undermining the success of renal transplantation. We anticipate the results of these studies will indicate new  therapeutic targets to inhibit or attenuate antibody-mediated graft injury."
"9344576","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Clefting of the lip and/or palate (CL/P) is the most common facial birth defect. This disruption of normal facial structure can lead to difficulties wit necessary functions such as breathing, feeding, and speech development. Clinical manifestations of CL/P are highly variable, indicating that the disorder is likely caused by a complex interaction of genetic and environmental factors. There is currently great interest in identifying the environmental factors that interact with genetic susceptibility to effect clinical presentation of CL/P, as further understanding of these factors could lead to important new treatments and interventions. Maternal nutrition is both a known influence on craniofacial development and an ideal target for future interventions. This project will investigate how genotype and vitamin A levels in the maternal diet interact to influence midfacial development and CL/P susceptibility and severity. In the first aim of this project, a mouse model allowing precise control over bioavailable levels of vitamin A will be used to assess the impact of mild and moderate maternal vitamin A deficiency (VAD) on facial phenotype. Using deformable morphology analysis, difference in phenotypes will be quantified and are expected to reveal a graded degree of change in facial morphology corresponding to the degree of maternal VAD. The second aim of this project will use mouse models allowing dietary control of vitamin A and/or CL/P sensitivity to investigate the impact of mild and moderate maternal VAD and maternal vitamin A supplementation on CL/P severity and frequency. Severity of phenotypes will be quantified using deformable morphology methods. The results are expected to show an increase in cleft severity and frequency corresponding to the degree of maternal VAD and a protective effect associated with vitamin A supplementation. This work will further the understanding of the underlying mechanisms and environmental modulators contributing to CL/P susceptibility and sensitivity which will help identify optimal treatment and preventative strategies."
"9470244","Abstract Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) is commonly used to treatment obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Many patients, but not all, experience T2DM remission after the procedure. The exact mechanism of improved glycemic control after RYGB is not fully elucidated and potential mediators include enhanced post- prandial secretion of glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1), a potent insulin secretagogue, and alterations in bile acid (BA) levels and composition. However, these two mechanisms have not been studied directly in individuals with or without diabetes remission after RYGB. In Aim 1, the role of endogenous GLP-1 on ?-cell function will be tested in 30 individuals prior to surgery and at 3 and 12 months after RYGB. Glycemic control, insulin secretion rates, and ?-cell glucose sensitivity will be assessed in response to an oral glucose challenge, with and without the infusion of exendin9-39, a competitive GLP-1 receptor antagonist. We will test the hypothesis that the role of GLP-1 on glucose control is greater in remitters than in non-remitters and that the improvement in ?-cell function after RYGB can be blocked by exendin9-39. In Aim 2, we will measure BA levels and composition from two large cohorts who underwent distinct modes of weight loss (RYGB (n=278) versus adjustable gastric banding (AGB) or lifestyle intervention (LSI) (total n=272)) to assess temporal changes in BA in individuals with and without T2DM remission with up to 5 years follow-up. We hypothesize that BA will increase more in those with T2DM remission than without remission and in those who underwent RYGB compared to AGB/LSI. Remitters and RYGB subjects will also have lower levels of 12?-hydroxylated BA which are associated with insulin resistance. The change in BA after RYGB may explain its superior effect on glycemic control. Data from this study will help identify mediators of the short- and long-term mechanism of diabetes remission, or lack of, after RYGB, and potentially lead to the development of new molecular targets for the treatment of T2DM."
"9397420","Lung cancer is a critical health care problem among Veterans, who have a higher incidence and worse outcome. Most individuals with lung cancer die of their disease because of drug resistance, invasion and metastases, features closely linked to the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and cancer stem cells (CSCs). Importantly, this resistant phenotype includes targeted agents (e.g., EGFR inhibitors), conventional chemotherapy, radiation, and escape from immune destruction by upregulation of PD-L1. The identification and therapeutic targeting of molecules contributing to the aggressive and resistant properties of lung cancer cells are key to tumor cell eradication and cure. Recently, we discovered that TGF?-mediated EMT involves upregulation of the cell surface receptor, Neuropilin-2 (NRP2). Importantly, NRP2 knockdown inhibits TGF?- mediated migration, invasion, metastasis and tumorsphere formation, a feature of CSCs. More recently, we discovered that TGF? induces the preferential translation of a previously uninvestigated isoform, NRP2b, which is identical to the prototype NRP2a in its extracellular domain, but diverges substantially before the transmembrane segment to encode a distinct, yet highly evolutionarily conserved, C-terminus. Our studies demonstrate that NRP2a and NRP2b have opposing effects on tumorigenesis, with NRP2b specifically promoting tumorigenesis, as well as signaling from the receptor tyrosine kinase, MET. The isoforms also differ in their binding to the PDZ domain protein, GIPC1, which is specific to NRP2a, and which is also known to function in receptor endocytosis and trafficking. Importantly, mutations that disrupt NRP2a-GIPC1 binding do not result in NRP2b-like activities, whereas C-terminal deletions of NRP2b attenuate its ability to enhance migration. These results suggest that the NRP2b C-terminus is critical to its pro-tumorigenic properties, which may result from differential interactions or trafficking of cell surface receptors, including MET. Understanding the mechanistic underpinnings of how NRP2b functions has therapeutic implications. This may come from identifying which cooperating receptors are most important, or elucidating the mechanisms by which NRP2b affects receptor trafficking, thus suggesting new therapeutic strategies. Aim 1 will use genetic approaches to further examine the role of MET in NRP2b function and tumorigenesis, as well as determine if NRP2 isoforms differentially interact with MET, or affect its endocytosis, trafficking and recycling. In addition, we will examine patient samples for co-expression of NRP2b along with markers of MET activation and EMT. Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that the effects of NRP2b on MET can be generalized to other receptors. Their contribution to NRP2b function and tumorigenesis will be examined. In Aim 3, we will use site-specific mutagenesis and domain swaps to identify critical residues in the 93 amino acid NRP2b C-terminus (JM, TM and cytoplasmic segments) responsible for its distinct activity. The JM segment is unique, extracellular and predicted to be antigenic. We will make monoclonal antibodies against this segment and test them for specificity and inhibitory activity. NRP2b represents a highly innovative avenue of research, which can be exploited for therapeutic gain. In addition, EMT plays a major role in inflammation, fibrosis and normal development, where the role of NRP2b is unknown. Thus, our proposed studies should have broad applicability to lung cancer and other human diseases."
"9486833","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):           Patients with critical surgical disorders such as trauma, thermal injury, shock, sepsis, and massive surgical operations are commonly complicated with acute gut mucosal injury and bleeding, but effective therapies to preserve the epithelial integrity are limited to date. Disrupton of the gut epithelial integrity causes sepsis and in some instances acts as the trigger that drives  multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS), a leading cause of death in critically ill patients. Early rapid epithelial restitution is an important primary repair modality in the gut mucosa and plays a critical role in maintaining mucosal integrity, but the exact mechanism underlying this process remains unclear. Epithelial restitution occurs as a consequence of cell migration over the damaged area after superficial injury, a process that is independent of cell proliferation. Our  previous studies have demonstrated that small GTPases are crucial for normal gut mucosal restitution after acute injury. However, the exact signals initiating the activation of GTPases aftr injury remain elusive and are the focus of this renewal application. a4 is a novel PP2A associated protein and is involved in many aspects of cell functions including cell motility. Our preliminary results indicate that a) early rapid mucosal restitution following injury was associate with an induction in a4 expression in mice; b) ectopic overexpression of the a4 gene enhanced epithelial restitution after wounding, whereas a4 silencing or inhibition of its downstream target ß-PIX repressed mucosal repair through a process involving the GTPase Rac1; and c) polyamines are necessary for normal expression of a4. Based on these exciting preliminary observations, we HYPOTHESIZE that a4 stimulates intestinal epithelial restitution after acute mucosal injury by altering PP2A/ß-PIX-mediated Rac1 signaling. Three specific aims are proposed to test the hypothesis: 1) to determine the pattern and role of a4 in gut epithelial restitution after acute mucosal injury in critical surgical conditions; 2) to analyze the mechanism  by which a4 regulates IEC migration during epithelial restitution; and 3) to define the cellular signaling pathways regulating a4 expression after mucosal injury, with a particular focus on cellular polyamines. Completion of this study will create a fundamental base for development of new therapies to enhance early rapid mucosal repair and preserve gut epithelial integrity under critical surgical conditions."
"9487854","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Heart disease is the leading cause of death for both men and women with over 600,000 deaths/year (25% of mortality). Coronary heart disease is the most common type of heart disease with about 715,000 patients suffering a heart attack each year. Death rates in our patient population in the southeast are even higher with African Americans having higher rates yet. Our VA patients reflect our local population with elevated risk of heart disease often presenting with hypertension, diabetes, obesity or overweight, smoking and excessive alcohol use. VA patients who have incurred LV injury due to myocardial infarction (MI) undergo ventricular remodeling, which can lead to chamber dilation and progress to congestive heart fail-ure. Monocyte-derived macrophages are believed to play a major role in the regulation of infarct healing. Post-MI repair is made up of a biphasic process with phase I mediated by inflammatory M1 macrophages that are phagocytic, and secrete high levels of MMPs, and proinflammatory mediators. By contrast the M2 macrophages produce anti-inflammatory cytokines and communicate with myofibroblasts, endothelial cells, parenchymal and local progenitor cells to help coordinate remodeling and repair of the damaged tissue. The controlled recruitment of the inflammatory monocytes and resulting macrophages is essential for proper healing but excessive or prolonged recruitment of these inflammatory monocytes and M1 macrophage results in deleterious remodeling and heart failure. Recent studies have demonstrated that increasing the M1 to M2 polarization appears to be an attractive strategy for decreasing inflammation and improvement of infarct healing and repair. Our preliminary data provide evidence for the first time that class I HDACs regulate M1 to M2 polarization of macrophages of the post-MI heart. Therefore, we hypothesize that class I HDACs serve as a master regulator of macrophage polarization and HDAC inhibitors reprogram the infiltrating monocytes and resulting macrophages toward the M2 phenotype in the post-MI heart. We have proposed Three Aims to test our hypothesis. Aim 1) Demonstrate that inhibition of class I HDACs attenuates M1 macrophage recruitment and promotes M1 to M2 polarization, which fosters infarct healing. Aim 2) Determine if targeted delivery of a class I HDAC inhibitor to inflammatory monocytes attenuates MI injury. Aim 3) Determine if treatment with a class I selective HDAC inhibitor in a murine model of chronic inflammation commonly seen in patients with atherosclerosis, results in reduced deleterious remodeling and preservation of ventricular function. Our approach will allow us to directly test whether targeted delivery of class I HDAC inhibitors to monocytes and macrophages can override the overwhelming inflammatory extracellular signaling milieu in the acute MI ventricle to reprogram macrophage phenotype to influence M1 to M2 transition. Importantly, our study will give us important new molecular insights into the role of class I HDACs in regulating macrophage polarization and possibly open a new translational approach for treatment of post-MI VA patients. It is hoped that the findings of this application will be translated into new and successful clinical treatment strategies to ameliorate post-MI injury for our Veterans."
"9487884","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         ABSTRACT: Cholangiocytes are the target cells in cholestatic liver diseases such as primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) and primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC). During the course of these diseases, mitotically dormant cholangiocytes are stimulated to proliferate and then are damaged. Associated with these cholangiopathies is a dysregulation of various neuroendocrine factors derived from the hypothalamus and the acquisition of a neuroendocrine phenotype in cholangiocytes. Taken together, these events contribute to the autocrine and paracrine pathways that modulate the proliferative response of cholangiocytes as well as liver damage and fibrosis in cholestatic liver injury. We have previously shown that circulating neuropeptide Y, and corticoptropin releasing hormone (CRH) are altered in models of biliary proliferation. Furthermore, we have recently demonstrated that the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis is dampened resulting in suppressed glucocorticoid levels during extrahepatic biliary obstruction and that reactivation of the HPA axis by hypothalamic administration of CRH suppresses the proliferative capacity of cholangiocytes after bile duct ligation (BDL), suggesting a broader concept of hypothalamic control of cholangiocyte proliferation. The objective of this proposal is to investigate mechanisms by which cholestasis regulates the expression of the hypothalamic peptide galanin and the subsequent effects of this altered response on cholangiocyte proliferation. Based upon strong preliminary data, we propose the novel central hypothesis that the bile acids that accumulate in the serum during cholestasis are responsible for the increased hypothalamic and circulating galanin levels and that the central and peripheral effects of galanin co-ordinately regulate cholangiocyte proliferation. Our proposed work will focus on three specific aims that have been designed to test the following working hypotheses: (1) The expression of the hypothalamic peptide galanin is upregulated during cholestatic liver diseases and activates the growth hormone releasing hormone (GHRH) /growth hormone (GH) axis to induce cholangiocyte proliferation, (2) Circulating levels of galanin are increased during experimental cholestasis and can act on cholangiocytes directly to induce proliferation, and (3) The alteration of the galanin expression in the hypothalamus is a direct result of the actions of bile acids in th hypothalamus. Dissecting the pathophysiological interactions between the brain and the liver during cholestatic liver diseases may lead to an enhanced understanding of the pathological processes and consequences of this particular type of live disease. This knowledge may play a paramount role in the development of therapeutic strategies for the treatment of cholangiopathies."
"9493345","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Inhibition of IGF-1R: A therapeutic strategy to inhibit colon cancer stem-like cells PD/PI: Patel, Bhaumik B. PROJECT DESCRIPTION Abstract: Despite recent advances in therapeutics, colorectal cancer remains the third deadliest cancer in the USA. This is mainly attributable to survival of a small population of cancer cells called stem cells (CSCs), which display dysregulated self-renewal, aberrant differentiation at the cellular level, and resistance to most cancer chemotherapies preventing complete cure of cancer. Others and we have shown that inhibition of IGF-1R- AKT-mTOR (InAT) axis is a promising approach to target this resistant population within the tumors. However, this promise has not lived up to the high expectations. We have uncovered a novel, critical and clinically relevant mechanism of IGF-1R inhibition's effect on CSCs that involves downregulation of mevalonate- isoprenoid biosynthesis (MIB) pathway, a precursor pathway of steroid synthesis, at levels distal to that targeted by statins, th widely used anti-cholesterol drugs. Inhibition of MIB pathway results in depletion of several bioactive terpenes that are involved in critical biological processes such as protein prenylation and N- Glycosylation, which in turn regulates ß-catenin signaling, a critical pathway governing colonic CSCs growth. We hypothesize that that a combination strategy employing simultaneous inhibition of InAT axis and MIB pathway, with FDA-approved agents or those that are in advanced clinical development, will results in synergistic downregulation of MIB pathway, ß-catenin signaling, and CSCs growth. This hypothesis will be tested in three specific aims. In vitro and in vivo models of CSCs as well as utilizing primary human colon cancer samples, we will establish significance of InAT axis and MIB pathway upregulation on CSCs growth (Aim 1). Subsequently, we will determine optimal therapeutic combination(s) of select agents from targeting InAT axis combined with those that suppress MIB pathway by employing sequential strategy of in vitro screening of the proposed drug combination in 10 selected colon cancer cell lines, with diverse genetic changes representing sporadic CRC, to identify highly synergistic combinations that will be advanced in animal models of CSCs growth (Aim 2). Moreover, we will examine detailed molecular mechanisms of inhibition of InAT axis (alone or in combination with a MIB pathway inhibitor, also 'optimum anti-CSCs combination(s)') on MIB pathway downregulation as well as CSCs growth by employing advanced biophysical and biochemical studies to a) determine levels of mevalonate pathway metabolites, b) determine the role of InAT-SREBP axis in regulating gene specific transcription of MIB pathway enzymes, and c) examining the role of downstream terpene molecules (which regulate prenylation and N-glycosylation) in regulating ß-catenin/TCF-4 signaling (Aim 3). The results from the proposed experiments would greatly expand our understanding of mechanisms of colon CSCs growth and identify 'optimum anti-CSCs combination(s)' therapy that will be immediately testable in the clinical trial(s), and will have paradigm-shifting implications in the treatment of colorectal cancr. 1"
"9486822","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):          Project Summary/Abstract Defective regulation of early intestinal mucosal restitution underlies various critical pathological states such as acute mucosal injury/hemorrhage, impaired repair of erosions/ulcers, disruption of epithelial integrity, and epithelial barrier dysfunction. Since the exact mechanisms of early rapid mucosal restitution after superficial wounds are still obscure, effective therapies to preserve gut epithelial integrity in clinic are limited, especially in patiets with critical surgical illnesses such as trauma and sepsis. The restoration of normal intestinal mucosal integrity after injury and/or ulceration requires epithelial cell decisions that regulate signaling networks controlling expression of various genes. Posttranscriptional events, particularly altered mRNA turnover and translation, are major mechanisms by which mammalian cells control gene expression in response to various stresses. Changes in mRNA stability and translation are predominantly governed by RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) and microRNAs (miRNAs) that are emerged as master regulators of maintenance of gut epithelial integrity. However, little is known about the roles of RBPs and miRNAs in the mechanisms underlying rapid mucosal restitution after acute injury. HuR is among the most prominent translation and turnover regulatory RBPs and is recently show to regulate cell motility. Our preliminary results indicate that a) HuR silencing represses intestinal epithelial cell (IEC) migration over the wounded area in an in vitro model; b) tissue specific HuR knockout inhibits early intestinal mucosal repair after injury; and c) miR-195 overexpression represses early epithelial repair in vitro, but this repression is rescued by increasing HuR levels. Based on these exciting observations, we HYPOTHESIZE that HuR is essential for intestinal epithelial restitution after injury by altering the stability and translation of target mRNAs encoding cell migration-regulatory proteins and its effect is regulated by given miRNAs. Three specific aims are proposed to test the hypothesis. 1) To determine the exact role of HuR in early intestinal mucosal restitution after acute injury. 2) To define new target mRNAs of HuR and its role in the regulation of mRNA stability and translation in the intestinal epithelium after wounding. 3) To investigate the interactions between HuR and given miRNAs in the control of stability and translation of target mRNAs in response to epithelial injury. Completion of these specific aims will make a significant conceptual advance by linking HuR/miRNA-mediated posttranscriptional gene regulation with early mucosal restitution in the intestine and will create a fundamental base for development of new therapeutic approaches for gut mucosal injury-related diseases and for maintaining epithelial integrity under various clinical conditions."
"9487880","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Cutaneous melanoma, the deadliest form of skin cancer, arises from neural crest derived melanocytes. Much progress has been made in delineating molecular events that initiate the cascade of malignant changes leading to metastatic melanoma. These advances have led to some remarkable improvements in treatment of melanoma. However, the notorious intrinsic resistance to conventional therapies and development of treatment resistance to targeted therapies continue to be vexing problems highlighting the need to explore additional avenues for preventing melanoma development and progression. In this context, the role for Notch signaling in melanoma remains to be fully understood and exploited. Notch signaling, an important cell signaling mechanism, is known to play a role in melanocyte development. However, molecular mechanisms and the specific roles Notch plays in melanoma development and progression are not completely understood.  Preliminary data obtained in my laboratory showed a possible biphasic role for Notch signaling in melanoma tumor progression. In skin resident benign neo-plastic melanocytes and early primary melanoma, a downregulation of Notch signaling and its effector HES1, a transcriptional repressor, allows elaboration of neuronal differentiation. This is indicated by the expression of a protein, MAP2 that is normally present only in terminally differentiated neurons that lack ability to divide. A retrospective survival analysis showed that patients whose primary skin tumors were MAP2-positive survived significantly longer without melanoma recurrence than those diagnosed with MAP2-negative melanoma. MAP2 is absent or found less frequently in metastatic melanoma. In agreement with its primary function of binding to and stabilizing microtubules, MAP2 alters the dynamic instability of microtubules and induces mitotic spindle defects in melanoma. Preliminary data also showed that molecular players that initiate the malignant changes in melanocytes also play a role in activation of this neuronal differentiation marker. Thus, activation of a neuron-specific gene in melanocytes at early stages of malignant transformation correlates with inhibition of proliferation in vitro and tumor growth and progression in vivo. Based on these data, we hypothesized that Notch signaling, has a dual or biphasic role in melanoma. First, Notch signaling is downregulated during early steps in malignant transformation by sustained oncogenic signaling to promote neuronal differentiation as a fail-safe mechanism against melanoma tumorigenesis, and additional genetic events such as loss of PTEN then lead to upregulation of Notch signaling to support melanoma tumor progression. To test this hypothesis, we will use a combination of in vitro and in vivo approaches to accomplish the following Aims:  In Aim 1, we will study mechanisms of transdifferentiation in melanocytes and patient-derived melanoma using primary melanocytes and a panel of well-characterized melanoma cell lines, we will investigate the molecular mechanisms. In Aim 2, we will investigate the role of Notch signaling and neuronal differentiation in melanomagenesis using metastatic melanoma cells with stable knockdown of HES1and/or treated with inhibitors of Notch signaling in immunocompromised mice, and a genetic cross between transgenic mice with inducible MPA2 expression in melanocytes and BrafCa/Pten-/- mice. In Aim 3, we will evaluate the prognostic significance of Notch in melanoma employing quantitative immunohistochemical method to analyze an in- house created melanoma tissue microarray consisting of 225 stage I-III primary melanoma specimens with complete clinical history.  The hypothesis on the dual role of Notch in transdifferentiation and use of combination of mouse genetic model and a fully annotated melanoma tissue microarray are the innovative aspects of the proposed research. Data obtained from these studies have the potential to uncover more reliable prognostic markers for melanoma aggressiveness and impact the management of aggressive cutaneous melanoma."
"9397414","Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory disease that manifests predominantly as a destructive synovitis. In spite of the prominence of the synovial inflammation, many immunological abnormalities are systemic. Autoantibodies are not tissue-specific and are directed against global antigens such as Ig Fc determinants and neoantigens of citrullinated peptides. T cell abnormalities in RA are already detectable in naïve T cells. Naïve T cells from RA patients have a lowered signaling threshold of the T cell receptor which may explain why failure in immune tolerance to neoantigens such as citrullinated peptides is the immunological hallmark of RA. They have defects in DNA repair mechanisms which predisposes for increased apoptosis susceptibility and accelerated immunosenescence. And they have rewired their metabolic network shunting glucose preferentially into the pentose phosphate pathway to reduce oxidative stress and produce metabolites necessary for synthetic activities. This application aims at gaining a deeper understanding of T cell dysfunction in RA by characterizing their epigenetic landscape. We will use a recently developed platform, assay for transposase accessible chromatin (ATAC)-sequencing that allows genome-wide mapping of the open chromatin within small populations of isolated T cells including antigen- specific T cells. [Three aims are proposed. The objective of Aim 1 is to identify RA-associated epigenetic signatures in naïve T cells by comparing patients with RA, psoriatic arthritis and age-matched controls and relate them to the signatures in memory T cells and autoantigen-specific T cells. Aim 2 will explore the influence of disease activity and treatment on these signatures. By examining transcription factor (TF) target sequences at accessible sites, we will define transcription factor networks that are associated with RA and/or related to cytokine exposure in peripheral blood or the synovial tissue. In Aim 3, we will explore the functional consequences of differential chromatin accessibility by comparing open sites to the transcriptome of T cell subsets before and after activation. In addition, we will determine the relationship of open sites to eQTLs and to causal SNPs implicated in RA. These studies will provide a comprehensive map of promoter and enhancer accessibilities in RA T cells that may determine the transcriptome at resting stage as well as their ability to respond and develop into autoantigen-specific effector T cells.]"
"9397417","The differentiation of mesenchymal progenitor cells (MPCs) in the bone marrow environment is a crucial determinant of bone mass, whole body metabolism, and bone repair. However, the mechanisms that regulate MPC differentiation are poorly understood. This proposal is based on the hypothesis that MPCs serve to sense metabolic stress which then directs their differentiation. In this view, the control of adipogenic vs. osteogenic differentiation of MPCs is a mechanism for balancing structural/biomechanical and metabolic needs. Excessive marrow adipogenesis is associated with bone loss and metabolic adaptation whereas excessive osteoblast differentiation favors acquisition of bone mass possibly at the cost of reduced capacity for metabolic adaptation. Conditions of high metabolic stress, such as diet- induced obesity, drive adipogenic differentiation in preference to osteoblast differentiation. We propose that G protein signaling is a key participant in metabolic sensing in MPCs, with the inhibitory G protein (Gi) signaling pathway promoting the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) that drives increased marrow adipogenesis and bone loss. These concepts will be tested in three specifics aims. In specific aims 1 and 2, we will utilize mouse genetic models to effect constitutive Gi signaling (Aim 1) or blockade of Gi signaling (Aim 2) in MPCs. We will investigate the effect of these manipulations on bone marrow adipose tissue, bone mass, fracture repair, and adaption to metabolic stress (high fat diet). In specific aim 3, we will use cellular and molecular approaches to elucidate the mechanisms by which MPC differentiation is regulated by Gi signaling and by metabolic stress. Successful completion of these studies will identify novel mechanisms for the control of skeletal and metabolic homeostasis, will provide new insights into the basis for the well-established relationship between bone mass and bone marrow adipose tissue, and may provide new opportunities for developing therapies aimed at improving bone and metabolic health."
"9378389","Osteoporosis is an aging related condition characterized by progressive loss of bone mass and increasing bone fragility that affects many Veteran men and women. Given the tremendous morbidity and excess mortality associated with osteoporosis-related fracture, it is vital to the VA healthcare mission to explore novel strategies to reduce fracture risk. The only current FDA-approved anabolic therapy for severe osteoporosis is teriparatide [hPTH(1-34)], a conventional agonist of the type 1 parathyroid hormone receptor (PTH1R). While effective at stimulating osteoblastic bone formation, its clinical utility is limited by unfavorable pharmacokinetics necessitating daily injection, its propensity to promote hypercalcemia, a lack of efficacy in states where endogenous PTH is elevated, and the rapid loss of accrued bone mass upon discontinuation of treatment. The ?ideal? anabolic agent for osteoporosis would circumvent these limitations, i.e. it would be capable of stimulating osteoblastic bone formation with prolonged exposure, and would ?uncouple? increased bone formation rates from accelerated bone resorption and renal calcium retention. One approach that has shown early promise is the use of ?biased? PTH1R agonists that stimulate receptor signaling through non-G protein effectors, e.g. arrestins, while antagonizing receptor coupling to heterotrimeric G proteins. ?Biased? ligands are novel pharmacological entities that possess the unique ability to engender ?mixed? agonist-antagonist effects in vivo that cannot be attained through conventional agonism or antagonism. In preliminary work, we have demonstrated that a modified bovine PTH derivative, [D-Trp12,Tyr34]-bPTH(7-34), can bias PTH1R in a manner that dissociates heterotrimeric G protein-dependent signaling from non-canonical arrestin-dependent signaling. In vivo, [D-Trp12,Tyr34]-bPTH(7-34) promotes osteoblast differentiation and survival leading to increased bone formation in eugonadal male and female mice, while antagonizing the G protein-mediated signals that lead to osteoclast activation and calcium retention. Functional genomic analysis of bone from mice treated with conventional and biased PTH1R agonists indicates that despite targeting the same receptor, [D-Trp12,Tyr34]- bPTH(7-34) and hPTH(1-34) have distinct mechanisms of action. The overall objective of this proposal is to determine whether an arrestin pathway-selective ?biased? PTH1R ligand affords specific advantages over teriparatide in terms of reduced side effects and retained efficacy in settings where a conventional PTH1R agonist is ineffective or contraindicated. Our central hypothesis is that a ?biased? ligand that uncouples arrestin-dependent PTH1R signals that increase osteoblast number/activity from G protein-mediated signals that stimulate osteoclastic bone resorption, will likewise uncouple the beneficial effects of PTH1R activation on bone formation from its adverse effects on bone resorption and renal calcium retention in vivo. The project consists of three specific aims, each of which compares conventional and ?biased? PTH1R agonists in a different pre-clinical rodent model of metabolic bone disease. Aim 1 tests whether an arrestin pathway- selective PTH1R agonist will promote net accrual of bone mass when administered by continuous infusion, a dosing regimen under which conventional PTH1R agonists may cause net bone loss through overstimulation of osteoclast activity. Aim 2 tests whether an arrestin pathway-selective PTH1R agonist, like a conventional agonist, will promote accrual of bone mass under conditions of sex steroid withdrawal, but do so without accelerating bone turnover or causing hypercalcemia/hypercalcuria. Aim 3 tests whether an arrestin pathway- selective PTH1R agonist will promote accrual of bone mass in the setting of secondary hyperparathyroidism induced by renal failure, a setting in which conventional PTH1R agonists are contraindicated due to already high circulating levels of endogenous PTH. Completion of this project will provide key pre-clinical tests of arrestin pathway-selective biased agonism as a novel anabolic approach to osteoporosis treatment, potentially leading to the development of novel therapeutics that will benefit many Veteran men and women."
"9487119","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a poorly understood neurodegenerative disease with no effective treatment. ALS is connected with military service and veterans are at a higher risk of contracting this debilitating disease. Mutations in several genes have been discovered to cause a subset of familial ALS, including copper- zinc superoxide dismutase (SOD1), fused in sarcoma (FUS), and TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43). Studying familial ALS using the well-defined genetic models will provide critical insights into the disease pathology as well as novel targets for future therapeutic development.  This project is focused on the RNA binding protein FUS that has been implicated in both familial and sporadic ALS. Since FUS mutations were found in a subset of familial ALS patients in 2009, mislocalization of mutant FUS in the cytoplasm has been considered a hallmark of this subset (Type 6) of ALS. However, protein inclusions containing wild-type FUS have been reported in multiple forms of familial and sporadic ALS, suggesting that FUS plays an important role in a larger portion of ALS beyond the Type 6 familial ALS. Protein inclusions can be caused by protein over-production, inefficient protein degradation, protein mislocalization, or a combination of these defects. However, the regulation of FUS protein expression and degradation remains poorly understood. We have published that it is critical to maintain proper levels of FUS inside the nucleus and that either elevated or reduced levels of FUS causes similar degenerative phenotypes in Drosophila models. Thus we propose that maintaining appropriate FUS protein homeostasis is critical to attenuate FUS toxicity and motor neuron dysfunction. Since little is known about how FUS gene transcription and protein turnover are regulated, discoveries in this project will fill this knowledge gap and advance the field significantly.  The specific hypotheses to be tested are: FUS gene transcription is regulated by the Jak/Stat signaling cascade (Aim 1) while FUS degradation is largely mediated by the ubiquitin-proteasome system (Aim 2). Moreover, we will test the hypothesis that FUS ubiquitination regulates its RNA binding and subcellular localization (Aim 3). We have carried out preliminary studies to show that the transcription of FUS is indeed controlled by Jak/Stat signaling and that Jak/Stat signaling attenuates FUS toxicity in Drosophila models. We also show that the degradation of FUS is mediated by the ubiquitin-proteasome system and that FUS ubiquitination is regulated by a specific E3 ligase named FBXW7. Moreover, a dominant negative mutant FBXW7 decreased FUS ubiquitination, delayed FUS degradation and changed FUS subcellular localization. Therefore each of these three specific hypotheses is supported by our preliminary results. These inter-related pathways play a critical role in regulating FUS function and alterations in any of them will likely contribute to the pathogenesis of ALS. The results from this study will help understand how to target FUS in motor neurons, providing a new avenue to attenuate FUS toxicity in future therapeutic developments.  The proposal is constructed based on a number of novel observations, which leads to a novel hypothesis that that FUS protein biosynthesis and turnover can be modulated to attenuate FUS toxicity in ALS. An array of techniques will be employed to test the hypothesis in a combination of in vitro and in vivo models. The results from the proposed studies should yield potential new targets that can be translated into novel treatments for veteran and other ALS patients."
"9541983","Project summary The Human Genome Project and subsequent projects such as 1000 Genomes, GTEx, and ENCODE provide powerful resources for the identification of genes that predispose to human diseases and determine variability in disease-related quantitative traits. Along with these resources have come increasingly efficient tools to genotype, sequence, and annotate the human genome, and to support computation across these data. These resources and tools will be critical as we continue to unravel the complex etiologic basis of common human diseases and disease-related quantitative traits. In this proposal, we describe a set of statistical and computational problems that arise in human /gene mapping, with a particular emphasis on genotype-array and sequence-based genome-wide association studies (GWAS). We describe how we will solve these problems through analytic methods, computer simulation, and testing on a diverse set of complex trait genetics data, and how we will generalize these solutions through the production, distribution, and support of efficient computer software. Specifically, we will: (a) more accurately estimate genotype imputation quality for low-frequency (0.5%<minor allele frequency [MAF]<5%) and rare (MAF<0.5%) genetic variants and so increase power of tests of association; (b) determine efficient designs for low-frequency and rare-variant GWAS that combine sequencing, genotyping, and genotype imputation; (c) build interactive, easy-to-use tools to display single-variant and multiple-variant (aggregation) genetic association results and relevant annotations; and (d) continue to update, distribute, and support software we will and have developed in this project , including tools to detect contamination in RNA-Seq and related studies . We will also continue to be opportunistic in identifying and addressing important design and analysis problems that relate to the goals of this project. Under separate funding, we will apply the resulting methods and tools to help understand the genetic basis of type 2 diabetes and related quantitative traits, schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder. Success in these aims will result in more powerful human genetic studies and enable more rapid identification of variants that predispose to human disease and account for variability in disease-related quantitative traits. Identification of these causal variants has the potential to lead to new insights into basic biology and disease etiology, identify novel therapies, improve targeting of therapies, assist in disease classification, and support more accurate prediction of disease risk."
"9397956","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):        Chronic inflammatory diseases, such as, rheumatoid arthritis (RA), are associated with premature development of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Mortality rates among US Veterans with RA are more than twice that of age-matched men in the general population, a risk that appears to be higher than that observed in other RA cohorts. Despite strong evidence that chronic inflammation accelerates CVD, currently available treatments are not sufficient to prevent the accelerated CVD. Therefore, other approaches that target the vascular effectors of chronic inflammation are needed. The long-term goal of our research program is to understand the mechanisms by which the Nox1 NADPH oxidase contributes to the pathogenesis of vascular disease and identify novel therapeutic targets to reduce CVD. In work that was funded by a VA Merit Award, we have identified mechanisms of cytokine-mediated Nox1 activation. Our findings have also established a link between epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) activation and Nox1 in vascular smooth muscle cell (SMC) growth and migration. In this renewal application, our objective is to integrate these findings and explore the mechanism by which chronic inflammation increases CVD. We hypothesize that chronic inflammation increases circulating EGF-like ligands, which induces vascular Nox1 expression and primes SMCs to cytokine activation, thereby promoting vascular disease. We will address the following specific aims: Aim 1: Determine the mechanism by which EGF-like ligands accelerate vascular injury via Nox1 activation. Proposed studies will be performed in cultured human vascular SMCs and assess (1) the role of Nox1 splice isoforms; (2) ROS-induced ROS mechanisms, and (3) priming effects of EGF-like ligands on SMCs? Aim 2: Determine whether interrupting EGFR-Nox1 activation in SMCs prevents accelerated development of vascular disease in chronic inflammation. Proposed studies will induce neointimal hyperplasia in genetically modified mice subjected to a model of inflammatory arthritis and examine the effects of (1) smooth muscle cell-specific deficiency of EGFR; (2) deficiency of Nox1; and (3) the inhibition of Nox1 phosphorylation, on neointimal formation. Aim 3: Determine if plasma EGF-like ligands identify RA patients at high risk for developing vascular disease. Proposed studies will utilize the Veterans Affairs Rheumatoid Arthritis (VARA) registry consisting of bio-specimens and longitudinal clinical data to investigate the association of plasma EGF-like ligands in RA patients with cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Successful completion of these studies will provide new insights into the mechanisms by which chronic inflammation, such as RA, increases morbidity and mortality of CVD. A positive clinical impact of our proposed studies is that our findings will provide new strategies fr the development of specific targeted therapeutics for the treatment of Veterans with chronic inflammation and vascular disease."

"9599110","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Heparan sulfate (HS) and chondroitin sulfate (CS) glycosaminoglycans play important roles in many physiological and pathological events, such as cell division, inflammation, neuronal development, and cancer metastasis. Naturally existing HS and CS display a diverse range of sulfation patterns. While this structural diversity bestows HS and CS with the ability to interact with many proteins, it greatly hinders the ability to decipher their structure-function relationships. In order to dramatically advance an understanding of the biological functions of glycosaminoglycans, it is critical to access large, structurally diverse libraries of HS and CS oligosaccharides bearing well-defined sulfation sequences. To date, synthetic methodologies toward HS and CS are mostly target oriented, resulting in only small sets of oligosaccharides. Furthermore, it remains difficult to prepare HS and CS sequences longer than a dodecasaccharide. To address these challenges, three research groups with strong, complementary expertise in HS and CS synthesis and biology have joined forces to accomplish the following aims. In Aim 1, new synthetic strategies are proposed to accelerate the synthesis of HS oligosaccharides. Methodologies will be developed to prepare the first comprehensive library of 256 HS tetrasaccharides representing all of the possible 2-O, 6-O and N sulfation motifs, along with a library of structurally diverse 3-O sulfated tetrasaccharides and HS hexasaccharides. In Aim 2, we propose new efficient, cost-effective routes to access the first comprehensive library of CS tetrasaccharides bearing all of the possible mammalian sulfation sequences. In Aim 3, HS/CS oligosaccharide-based polymers and head-to-tail multimers will be prepared to enable access to structures containing homogeneously sulfated glycans with sizes approaching natural polysaccharides. These mimetics will possess similar domain structures and multivalent properties found in naturally existing CS and HS polysaccharides. In Aim 4, we will validate the hypothesis that our molecules can recapitulate the biological functions of HS and CS polysaccharides using well-established assays, including anticoagulation, neuronal growth, and protein-binding assays. Furthermore, we will explore the potential for these molecules to selectively target a clinically important family of proteins, the fibroblast growth factors. Together, this project will provide faster, more affordable syntheses of HS and CS, greatly expand the chemical space currently accessible by synthesis, enable the first direct, in-depth comparisons between HS and CS, and provide novel agents to control the activities of these biomedically important molecules."
"9486851","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):           The broad objective of this research program is to use a mouse model to understand the cellular mechanisms underlying alterations in sleep spindles in schizophrenia (Sz), a disease which is highly prevalent in the VA and which consumes ~40 % of the VA mental healthcare budget. Recent studies in Sz patients have provided consistent evidence for abnormalities in the number and intrinsic frequency of sleep spindles, a waxing and waning electroencephalographic (EEG) pattern observed during light non-REM (NREM) sleep. However, human studies are limited in their ability to decipher the underlying cellular mechanisms. Thus, here we propose to use state-of-the-art optogenetic techniques in mice to investigate the underlying neurobiology.  Previous basic science work suggested that sleep spindles require the activity of GABAergic neurons in the thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN), most of which contain the calcium binding protein, parvalbumin (PV). Postmortem findings in Sz indicate reductions in the activity of cortical GABAergic neurons containing PV. Since TRN PV neurons are derived from the same developmental pathway, a plausible and so far untested hypothesis is that sleep spindle abnormalities are due to downregulation of the activity of TRN PV neurons.  Recent studies in Sz patients using the hypnotic, eszopiclone, which targets the a3-subunit-containing GABAA receptors expressed by TRN neurons, ameliorates sleep & sleep spindle abnormalities and improves memory consolidation. Thus, if successful, our experiments in mice could lead to novel therapies to correct Sz spindle abnormalities based on the manipulation of the activity of TRN PV neurons and thereby improve cognition, a core impairment in Sz.  Our experiments have specific predictions that shed light on the role of TRN PV neurons in the cellular mechanisms of spindles. We test the effect on TRN PV neurons and cortical EEG using optogenetic stimulation with Channelrhodopsin2 (ChR2) (gain of function for spindles and NREM sleep) and inhibition using the proton pump ArchT (loss of function for spindles and NREM sleep).  Experiments in Specific Aim (SA) 1 will test if bilateral ChR2 stimulation will elici sleep spindles and increase NREM sleep, thereby also reducing auditory sensory transmission during NREM episodes. Unit recordings will show identified TRN PV neurons will fire in bursts associated with spindles.  Experiments in SA 2 will test if bilateral optical inhibition of TRN PV neurons will reduce spindles and NREM sleep, modeling spindle abnormalities in Sz.  Experiments in SA 3 will investigate an important and so far poorly investigated input pathway to TRN, arising in the basal forebrain. We will test if optical excitation of the basal forebrain GABA/PV input to TRN will reduce sleep spindles in vivo and inhibit TRN PV neurons in vitro, thereby testing the functional role of this anatomically documented pathway, with predicted inhibition of TRN PV neurons producing spindle reduction. In vitro experiments will test our hypothesis of mediation of effects on TRN PV neurons by GABAA receptors containing an a3-subunit, mimicking the a3-subunit effect of eszopiclone.  Finally in SA 4 we will test if bilateral  optogenetic manipulation of TRN PV neurons will alter memory recall in the Novel Object Recognition Task, thus mimicking the cognitive deficits seen in Sz. We predict Chr2 will improve and Arch T will impair performance."
"9487874","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a significant risk factor for the development of hepatic insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes and is also linked to the development of other serious liver disease states including steatohepatitis, cirrhosis, and hepatic carcinoma. NAFLD is recognized as a significant health problem in the VA population. Our previous results show that mitochondrial function is linked to the development of NAFLD. Unfortunately, the mechanism(s) that govern hepatic mitochondrial function and thus alter susceptibility for hepatic steatosis remain largely unknown. Peroxisome proliferator-activated gamma co-activator alpha (PGC-1?) co-activates nuclear transcriptional factors resulting in increased mitochondrial biogenesis. Both PGC-1? and mitochondrial function are suppressed in obesity. In contrast, we have shown that in vivo liver-specific PGC-1? overexpression (o/e) increases mitochondrial function and reduces hepatic lipid accumulation. But these results may not be solely attributable to increased mitochondrial biogenesis. Recent data shows that maintenance of high quality mitochondria is also dependent on the turnover and degradation of low functioning or damaged mitochondria in the lysosome by a process termed mitophagy (i.e. autophagy of mitochondria). To that end we found that PGC-1? overexpression also increased markers of autophagy, a link that has never before been examined. This proposal will test the primary hypothesis that PGC- 1? plays a primary role in mediating a coordinated co-activation of mitochondrial biogenesis and mitophagy that is necessary for maintaining mitochondrial function and preventing and treating NAFLD. Rodent models that possess defects in mitochondrial biogenesis or mitophagy due to specific genetic alterations will be used to test the importance of the respective pathways. We will also use molecular gain of function therapy (overexpression of PGC-1?) and exercise training to modulate pathways, in addition to performing in-vitro primary hepatocyte studies to isolate hepatic specific mechanism(s) and examine acute molecular changes that underlie whole body results. The specific aims will: 1) Determine if impaired capacity for mitochondrial biogenesis and mitophagy increases susceptibility for hepatic steatosis and insulin resistance due to reduced mitochondrial function, and 2). Test if increased mitophagy and mitochondrial function are necessary for treatment of hepatic steatosis and insulin resistance."
"9444661","Abstract: Prediction of risk for mental disorders is the cornerstone of ?preventive psychiatry?. Emerging data report that up to 45% of subjects at familial high risk for schizophrenia (FHR) develop broad psychosis spectrum psychopathology and cognitive impairments although conversion to psychosis is less than 15%. Long term prospective examination of FHR adolescents/young adults to characterize early predictors of risk for psychosis, broad psychosis spectrum psychopathology and cognitive impairments is critical for prevention and early intervention. Our well characterized unique cohort of FHR adolescents/young adults that were extensively phenotyped between 2003 and 2008 is uniquely suited to address these goals. We published one predictive model each for the emergence of psychopathology with 80% accuracy (sensitivity 0.5, specificity 0.92, positive likelihood ratio 6.25, negative likelihood ratio 0.54), and for psychosis with 88% accuracy (sensitivity 0.17, specificity 0.99, positive and negative likelihood ratios 17 and 0.83, respectively). Our goal is to call back 75 FHR subjects from this cohort (?75%) and examine the validity of these predictions with real-world outcomes of psychosis, broad psychosis spectrum psychopathology and cognitive impairments by including more refined baseline variables and genetic vulnerability using genomewide polygenic risk score and variants of complement gene C4. Independent lines of evidence recently showed association of C4 variants with schizophrenia risk at genomewide significance and increased synaptic pruning. The broad range of outcomes are examined within the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) framework using dimensional changes in working memory and executive function constructs. We will also build a predictive model and a long range multimodal risk calculator for outcome incorporating the real world outcomes to improve sensitivity and positive likelihood ratio while preserving higher specificity and prediction accuracy, elucidate dimensional changes in working memory and executive function, and test these predictions in a replicate sample of FHR from the Edinburgh High Risk Study, which is the largest in the world (aim 1). Using a ?top-down? approach, we will examine how the psychopathological outcomes and dimensional changes in working memory and executive function map on to neural circuitry with hippocampus as a hub. Ultra-high field (7 Tesla) structural MRI, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) fMRI will examine hippocampal subfields and subdivisions, anatomical circuitry, and functional changes to the working memory and executive function tasks (aim 2). We will also derive preliminary outcome biotypes that may be biologically more meaningful for future validation. On successful completion of the project, our data is likely to provide useful leads to long-term biologically-based dimensional phenotypic outcomes of FHR subjects as well as for broad psychosis spectrum psychopathology and cognitive impairments. Identification of such outcomes may provide fundamental biobehavioral constructs for novel treatment designs. Such a long-term follow up of a richly phenotyped FHR individuals has not been attempted, to our knowledge."
"9487875","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Mutations in the RNA-binding protein TDP-43 cause amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Inclusions enriched in TDP-43 in the cytoplasm of spinal cord neurons in both familial and sporadic ALS are hallmarks of the disease. Two recent yeast genome-wide loss-of-function toxicity suppressor screens revealed the strongest suppressor of TDP-43-mediated toxicity is the ablation of the gene encoding the metallophosphoesterase (MPE) Dbr1, the only enzyme known to hydrolyze the 2',5'-phosphodiester bonds formed within introns during their excision from pre-mRNA by the spliceosome. Decreasing Dbr1 activity results in the accumulation of RNA lariats that are proposed to sequester pathogenic TDP-43, preventing it from interfering with normal RNA metabolism. Supporting this hypothesis, knockdown of debranching activity in yeast, a human neuronal cell line, and in primary rat neurons protects them from TDP-43-mediated toxicity. The high degree of sequence identity in the catalytic domains of Dbr1 proteins across all eukaryotic species supports the observation that Dbr1's influence on TDP-43 activity is similar from yeast to man. We recently determined the first crystal structures of an RNA lariat debranching enzyme alone and in complex with a synthetic RNA containing a bona fide branchpoint identical to those found in intron RNA lariats. Dbr1 from the eukaryotic organism Entamoeba histolytica (Eh) crystallized most readily, revealing several unexpected features of Dbr1 enzymes relative to other MPE family members. All Dbr1 enzymes are mononuclear, possessing an invariant active site cysteine residue in the position of the aspartic acid observed in all previously characterized MPE superfamily members, all of which are active as dinuclear enzymes. In addition, all Dbr1 proteins contain a highly conserved insertion loop not found in other MPEs we term the lariat recognition loop (LRL). Functional data coming from in vivo complementation assays using multiple Dbr1 variants expressed in trans in ?dbr1 yeast support the proposed mononuclear enzymatic mechanism, as well as the roles assigned to the various unique structural elements observed in the crystal structures. The structures also reveal the molecular basis for how Dbr1 distinguishes 22,52-phosphodiester linkages from the far more abundant 32,52-phosphodiester linkages. With these results in-hand, we are now in possession of the tools needed to test the hypothesis that inhibition of Dbr1 represents a novel therapeutic avenue to treat TDP-43-mediated ALS. These tools include: 1) large quantities of purified Dbr1 proteins from multiple species, including human; 2) a tested, robust in vitro RNA debranching assay amenable to high throughput screening (HTS) of small molecule libraries for inhibitors; 3) the ability to synthesize, in parallel with the HTS inhibitor search, branched RNA analogs through the introduction of sugar modifications and linkers in order to mimic the conformation of the branched RNA we observe bound to the enzyme crystallographically, which differs from the conformations of these species in solution; 4) an in vivo complementation assay to test the effectiveness of potential inhibitors coming from both of the pipelines mentioned above; 5) the ability to rapidly observe the atomic details of inhibitor?Dbr1 complexes to enable the rational design of compounds with greater affinity and specificity; 6) the ability to perform initial toxiciy screens of candidate Dbr1 inhibitor compounds using cultured human neurons; and 7) the ability to pursue the structure of human Dbr1. The completion of the work outlined in this proposal on the Dbr1 enzyme is required before testing inhibitors in cell-based and murine models of TDP-43 mediated toxicity in ALS can begin."
"9487905","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is an important source of morbidity and mortality among U.S. Military Veterans. The primary virulence factors are TcdA and TcdB, toxins that induce diarrhea, inflammation, and significant damage within the colon. This proposal is designed around the hypothesis that inhibition of toxin activity represents a therapeutic approach that can impact clinical treatment and outcome for individuals suffering from CDI.  TcdA and TcdB are homologous glucosyltransferases that modify and inactivate Rho family GTPases. The glucosyltransferase activity of the toxins has been linked to a `cytopathic' disruption of the acti cytoskeleton and is important for systemic toxicity in a mouse intoxication model. The X-ray crystal structures of small molecule glucosyltransferase inhibitors bound to the TcdA and TcdB glucosyltransferase domains (Aim 1) will provide a foundation for structure-guided design of molecules with enhanced potency.  In addition to the cytopathic effects, TcdB is a potent cytotoxin that causes necrotic damage in cells and tissue. The cytotoxicity results from TcdB-induced assembly of the epithelial cell NADPH oxidase (NOX) complex. The assembly results in the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which cause necrosis. Preliminary data indicate that a Nox1 knockout mouse is protected from CDI tissue damage and underscores the hypothesis that inhibition of the NOX1 pathway will protect against the colonic tissue damage observed in severe cases of CDI.  A high-throughput screen has led to the identification of 176 small molecules that inhibit TcdB-induced necrosis. Experiments in Aim 2 will categorize these compounds according to their mechanism of action and result in the identification of lead compounds for further analysis. In Aim 3, the efficacy of N- acetylcysteine, an FDA-approved antioxidant, along with lead compounds from Aims 1 and 2 will be evaluated in a mouse model of CDI. Spore challenge with an epidemic M7404 strain and a panel of variants with defined mutations in one or both toxins will permit dissection of the specific effect each compound has on TcdA- and TcdB-mediated events. These are the key studies needed to advance small molecule inhibitors of the C. difficile toxins into clinical practice."
"9397419","The five subtypes of dopamine receptors (D1-D5) are members of the superfamily of G protein-coupled receptors. The D1 and D2 subtypes are the most abundant and mediate most classic dopamine-dependent behaviors. This application is focused on the D2 receptor and, in particular, on the functional significance of a 29-residue fragment in the third cytoplasmic loop that is alternatively spliced to produce the short and long forms of the D2 receptor, D2S and D2L. Considerable evidence indicates that the D2 receptor is the primary autoreceptor that regulates DA neuron activity and DA release, and it is widely accepted that D2S is that autoreceptor, whereas D2L is the postsynaptic receptor expressed in striatal medium spiny neurons. In contrast, our work supports a model in which rodent dopamine neurons express both splice variants, and both function as autoreceptors with some subtle differences. We have determined that one difference between the splice variants is their rate of calcium-dependent desensitization and we now propose to evaluate the significance of this difference for cocaine-induced sensitization, reward, and aversion, while also comparing other functional properties of the splice variants. In the first specific aim we will compare additional aspects of the function of D2L and D2S as the presynaptic autoreceptor that inhibits dopamine release, dopamine neuron firing, and locomotor activity. We will use virus-mediated expression of D2L or D2S in the midbrain of D2 receptor null-mutant (D2-KO) mice and of mice with regional D2 receptor knock- out, to restore the expression of either D2L or D2S in dopamine neurons prior to assessing measures of D2 autoreceptor activity. We will also determine if both variants regulate G protein-mediated signaling in striatal neurons. This aim will focus on receptor localization and regulation of dopamine release and reuptake, and will explore the hypotheses that cocaine alters the distribution or expression of the variants. The second specific aim is based on alternative hypotheses that a cocaine-induced somatodendritic autoreceptor switch from D2S to D2L triggers or reflects other changes that produce behavioral sensitization, conditioned place preference to cocaine, and decreased aversion, or that the phenotype switch is a compensatory mechanism that mediates decreased reward and increased aversion. In this aim we will test these hypotheses by measuring cocaine-induced behavioral sensitization, conditioned place preference, and conditioned taste aversion in mice expressing only D2S or D2L autoreceptors. Experimental support for either hypothesis will provide valuable insight into the relevance of D2 receptor alternative splicing for DA neuron function."
"9487848","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         The gold standard for the treatment of severe peripheral artery disease remains bypass grafting with autologous vein. However, when vein is not available, prosthetic grafts must be utilized and are associated with very high failure rates, approaching 70% at just 2 years. The primary cause of failure of prosthetic grafts is development of neointimal hyperplasia. It is well established tht nitric oxide (NO) is a potent inhibitor of neointimal hyperplasia. The two main classes of NO donors that have been used to inhibit neointimal hyperplasia locally are diazeniumdiolates and S-nitrosothiols (RSNO). Graft modifications with either class of NO donors have shown only limited improvement in graft function due to a short duration of NO release. However, RSNO remain attractive because they are present in human plasma and can release NO upon reaction with light, metal ions, or L-ascorbic acid (AA). Thus, to overcome the limitation of drug delivery duration, we propose to develop and evaluate a catalytically active graft that will release NO at the blood-material interface for an extended duration of time by immobilizing AA to the luminal surface of the graft. This concept takes advantage of the limitless reservoir of circulating RSNO that will react with AA on the graft surface to release NO. We hypothesize that a catalytically active prosthetic graft engineered to incorporate AA on the lumen surface will utilize endogenous circulating RSNO to generate NO at the blood-material interface and inhibit the formation of neointimal hyperplasia. To confirm the feasibility of our approach, we synthesized a first generation poly(1,8 octanediol-citrate-ascorbate) (POCA) copolymer and demonstrated prolonged generation of NO upon contact with RSNO solutions in vitro. Preliminary data show 30% POCA degradation at 2 months. This is important, as NO will be released as long as POCA is present on the graft. By the time POCA is completely degraded, the NO will have simulated endogenous endothelialization of the graft, thereby abrogating the need for external NO release. Supporting our approach, we implanted a POCA graft using a guinea pig aortic interposition model and found less graft hyperplasia at 1 month. Thus, given our promising preliminary data, we propose to investigate our hypothesis with the following Specific Aims: 1) synthesize and characterize biocompatible AA containing polydiolcitrate copolymers that catalyze the conversion of RSNO to NO and use these copolymers to fabricate catalytically active ePTFE grafts; 2) evaluate the safety, biocompatibility, and efficacy of the catalytically active POCA-ePTFE graft at inhibiting neointimal hyperplasia in vivo; and 3) evaluate the biocompatibility and efficacy of an optimized catalytically active POCA-ePTFE graft at inhibiting neointimal hyperplasia in an atherosclerotic animal model in vivo. Currently, prosthetic grafts are a poor substitute for autologous vein and there is a significant need to develop novel strategies to improve prosthetic graft patency rates. Through a multidisciplinary collaboration, we have demonstrated the feasibility of our approach. Successful completion of the studies described in this proposal will provide an innovative approach to locally generate NO, an important therapeutic agent, while overcoming limitations of other graft modification approaches, and directly lead to preclinical investigations. Once validated, this technology has the potential to positively impact veteran health care."
"9487131","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and Kaposi's sarcoma-associated virus (KSHV) are human oncogenic herpesviruses that cause a wide variety of lymphomas and malignancies of epithelial and endothelial origin. Lytic reactivation from latent infection and expression of lytic cycle genes ar important in pathogenesis of both viruses. While viral factors important for replication have been extensively studied, major gaps exist in our knowledge of host factors that control KSHV and EBV reactivation. We have shown that cohesin and CTCF, two cellular proteins that bind to chromatin and modulate transcription, potently repress KSHV lytic replication and virus production. Cohesin is removed from the KSHV genome when it begins to replicate and depletion of either CTCF or cohesin leads to widespread de-repression of KSHV gene transcription. CTCF and cohesin are chromosome remodelers that mediate DNA looping and three-dimensional changes in conformation. Based on these known functions of CTCF and cohesin, we hypothesize that they impose topological constraints on KSHV and EBV circular latent genomes that prevent efficient transcription and DNA replication until they are removed.  In contrast, a select subset of KSHV genes is poorly expressed when cohesin or CTCF is depleted. Many of these genes have promoters with paused RNA pol II, a characteristic of promoters that are positively regulated by cohesin. This cluster of KSHV genes also encodes proteins that have unique immunoevasive and growth promoting functions. Several of them are immunomodulatory and act as viral cytokines that blunt the host antiviral response. Others downregulate surface molecules on KSHV-infected cells rendering them less prone to cell-mediated immune recognition. These proteins are rapidly expressed early during primary infection. We hypothesize that KSHV utilizes cohesin and CTCF to efficiently express these particular genes early in infection and reactivation.  We first propose to expand our studies to EBV, thus establishing these cohesin/CTCF regulatory mechanisms as a general paradigm for host control of gammaherpes virus reactivation. These mechanisms will be confirmed and characterized in unique EBV-infected cell lines from patients with mutations in the cohesin pathway. We will determine the molecular mechanisms by which cohesin and CTCF inhibit KSHV transcription and the extent to which they directly inhibit the physical process of viral DNA replication. We will investigate the molecular pathways by which cohesin is removed from latent viral genomes to permit lytic replication - systematically studying the role of proteins that modif cohesin and load and release it from human chromosomes. Compounds that inhibit removal or enhance loading of cohesin will be employed to validate these pathways as therapeutic targets. Finally, we will define the contribution of cohesin and CTCF to KSHV's ability to express immune evasion genes. We will determine the extent to which depletion of CTCF and cohesin impairs KSHV immune modulator expression and function. We will confirm these findings by constructing and characterizing KSHV mutant viruses which cannot bind cohesin and CTCF at the immunonomodulatory gene locus and the origin of replication. This multi-faceted approach to investigating host control of KSHV and EBV should yield many novel insights into the host-pathogen balance in the broad areas of viral reactivation and immune evasion."
"9487870","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Tuberculosis (TB), caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb), is a global health problem. Treatment of drug-susceptible TB involves months of therapy with multiple potentially toxic antibiotics. Treatment of TB has become even more difficult by the emergence and increasing prevalence of multi-drug resistant M.tb. This proposal focuses on the development of a novel therapy that targets M.tb iron (Fe) acquisition, a process that is critical to its ability to cause  disease. Ga(NO3)3 is a FDA- approved drug for treating hypercalcemia of malignancy. It interferes with cellular Fe metabolism by competing with Fe for uptake/use. We find that Ga also decreases M.tb Fe acquisition, inhibits growth of both drug-susceptible and drug-resistant M.tb strains growing in vitro extracellularly and within human macrophages. Ga also demonstrated efficacy in murine models of M.tb infection. Intermittent systemic delivery of Ga(NO3)3 for a few days has shown minimal toxicity in humans. However, treatment of TB would likely require more sustained treatment regimens. Ways to improve targeting of Ga to infected macrophages, extend dosing intervals, or avoid systemic administration would improve Ga's therapeutic index. There have been considerable advances in recent years in the aerosol delivery of drugs to the lung, as well as cellular targeting of nanoparticles to accomplish these goals. Therefore, we hypothesize that Ga delivery by aerosol or nanoparticle to the lung could prove to be novel, well-tolerated, and effective therapies for TB that would work via disruption of M.tb Fe metabolism. In order to test the above hypothesis we propose to accomplish the following specific aims: 1. Identify forms of Ga that exhibit maximal in vitro potency against extracellular and intracellular M.tb, including MDR- and XDR-TB, with the goal of arriving at lead compounds. 2. Develop formulations of two lead Ga compounds that will allow them to be administered by inhalation for the treatment of pulmonary TB and determine their biodistribution, pharmacokinetics, toxicity and efficacy in murine models of pulmonary TB. 3. Develop nanoparticle formulations of two lead Ga compounds that will allow them to be administered for the treatment of pulmonary TB and determine their biodistribution, pharmacokinetics, toxicity and efficacy in murine models of pulmonary TB. 4. Determine mechanisms of action of the lead Ga formulations against M.tb, potential for emergence of resistance, and effect of the presence of other TB drugs on Ga anti-mycobacterial activity. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODOLOGY: Human monocyte-derived macrophages and murine models of TB will be employed along with fully virulent strains of M.tb. The work will emphasize: Fe and Ga acquisition by M.tb: Ga biodistribution, pharmacokinetics, toxicity; and potential bacterial target for Ga antimicrobial activity. Experimental methods employed include: development of Ga formulations suitable for aerosol or nanoparticle-mediated delivery; bacterial uptake of radiolabeled Fe and Ga, growth of M.tb in vitro and in vivo, murine models of pulmonary TB, quantitation of Ga in tissues. POTENTIAL IMPACT ON VETERAN HEALTH CARE: Veterans are at high risk for pulmonary TB. This work could lead to development of novel treatments for TB that would benefit veterans."
"9378385","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):          Alcohol abuse exacts a major toll on health and health costs in Veterans. Indeed, even though there is an epidemic of hepatitis C in the U.S., alcohol-related liver injury remains a higher cause of mortality. Studies from the Veterans Administration showed that patients with cirrhosis and superimposed alcoholic hepatitis had > 60% mortality over a four-year period of time, with most of those deaths occurring in the first few months. Thus, the prognosis for this stage of ALD is worse than many common types of cancer, such as breast, prostate and colon. Unfortunately, there is no FDA-approved therapy for any stage of ALD, and this makes the need for this proposed research even more compelling. Recent studies from our laboratory and others have demonstrated that dietary unsaturated fat, specifically rich in linoleic acid (LA), exacerbated alcohol-mediated liver and intestinal injury in an experimental animal model of ALD. Our preliminary data show elevated levels of circulating oxidized LA metabolites, specifically 9- and 13-hydroxy-octadecadienoic acids (9-and 13-HODEs) in parallel with the up-regulation of hepatic 12/15 lipoxygenase (12/15-LO), a key enzyme involved in the oxidation of LA, in an animal model of ALD. These findings led us to postulate that specific oxidized LA metabolites (OXLAMs) play a significant role in ALD. OXLAMs are natural ligands to the transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1), a ligand-gated non-selective cation channel with high permeability for Ca2+. Recent studies demonstrate a critical role for Ca2+ release in inflammasome activation, which are key signaling platforms for stressor-induced pathogenesis, and which, upon activation, trigger the release of highly pro- inflammatory cytokines interleukin-1? (IL-1?)  and interleukin-18 (IL-18). IL-1? release is thought to be a critical mediator of inflammation and  thus, serves as a potential therapeutic target for treating hepatic inflammation in ALD. We propose that OXLAMs contribute to the EtOH-induced hepatic inflammation and injury via two major mechanisms: 1) OXLAMs-mediated mitochondrial dysfunction, endoplasmic reticulum stress (ER stress) and hepatocyte death; and 2) OXLAM/TRPV1/Ca2+-mediated inflammasome activation and IL-1? release. The proposed studies will help elucidate the molecular mechanisms of alcohol-induced liver injury, including alcohol-diet interactions, which may lead to identification of new therapeutic targets and potential dietary interventions for treating ALD, as well as help to explain why only some heavy drinkers develop clinically important ALD. Our research will be achieved through 3 specific aims: Aim 1. Evaluate whether OXLAMs exacerbate EtOH-mediated liver injury via induction of mitochondrial dysfunction, ER stress, and hepatocyte cell death in an animal model of ALD; Aim 2. Determine whether OXLAMs contribute to an EtOH-induced hepatic pro-inflammatory response via OXLAM-TRPV1-mediated inflammasome activation and subsequent increase in IL-? release in an animal model of ALD. Aim 3. Explore the role of OXLAMs in monocytes/macrophages inflammasome activation in Alcoholic Hepatitis in Veterans."
"9397418","Solid organ transplantation necessitates the use of lifelong immunosuppression. In particular, the calcineurin inhibitors (CNIs) are utilized in nearly all transplant recipients as they are potent immunosuppressants. In kidney transplantation, the use of CNIs has led to the very low rejection rates of ~7-10% per year. However, long term graft survival has not improved substantially with their utilization, with a mean half-life of 10 years for kidney transplants. A key contributor to late graft injury is CNI-nephrotoxicity which is manifested by declining kidney function and the histological features of interstitial fibrosis, tubular atrophy, and arteriolar hyalinosis. The mechanism by which CNI induce kidney injury and failure is multifactorial, and to date, there are no specific therapeutic strategies to mitigate this injury. The goal of this submission is to identify a novel and clinically applicable strategy to ameliorate CNI-associated kidney injury. Recently, AMP-Activated Protein Kinase (AMPK), a key regulator of cell metabolism, autophagy, and mitochondrial biogenesis, has been linked to modulating kidney injury. Further, loss of AMPK activation is associated with organ inflammation and fibrosis. We hypothesize that AMPK activation could ameliorate some of the adverse metabolic consequences in renal tubular epithelium and as a corollary, AMPK activation could be a clinically relevant intervention to mitigate long term CNI nephrotoxicity. Our study will focus on cyclosporine A (CsA), a classic CNI therapeutic agent. We will utilize a complementary series of studies, both in vitro and in vivo, using a mouse model of CsA injury that we have used successfully in our laboratory. In vitro, we will focus on renal tubular epithelium, the primary target of in vivo injury. We will study both the impact of AMPK activation as well as knock down using pharmacologic agents and silencing RNAs. Outcomes will include assessments of bioenergetics, mitochondrial function, pro-inflammatory markers and the DAMP HMGB1, and paracrine impact on macrophages and their differentiation. In vivo, we will test the impact of AMPK activation on ameliorating CsA renal injury by assessing kidney function (serum creatinine), mRNA expression of inflammatory mediators within the kidney, and biochemical, cellular and histologic assessments of injury and fibrosis. We will assess both pre-emptive inhibition as well as determine the impact of AMPK activation after established CsA nephrotoxicity. To complement these pharmacologic studies, we will also employ the novel use of AMPK ?1 and ?2 deficient mice. Cross-transplant studies will allow us to dissect the role of systemic versus renal expression of AMPK in injury. We believe that this comprehensive approach will provide key mechanistic insights into ameliorating or mitigating CNI nephrotoxicity. The use of a clinically relevant activator, metformin, will provide an opportunity for rapid translation into our human recipients of kidneys and other solid organ transplants."
"9489019","PROJECT ABSTRACT The proposed study will help to establish methods for rapid detection of heteroresistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) infections among HIV-infected TB patients. Heteroresistant MTB infections involve both drug-resistant and drug-susceptible types of MTB. A person with heteroresistant MTB infection is more likely to develop fully drug-resistant TB, which can cause poor treatment outcomes, increasing morbidity and mortality. People living with HIV appear to be especially at high risk for acquiring heteroresistant TB infections, and TB remains the leading cause of death among HIV-infected persons in resource poor countries, including Botswana. Recent developments in sequencing technology (deep sequencing) could be a powerful tool for rapidly detecting heteroresistant MTB infections. However, no study has systematically evaluated deep sequencing for detecting heteroresistance among TB patients in a clinical setting. Improved understanding of heteroresistance will contribute to significant improvements in TB morbidity and mortality and advance scientific understanding of TB. We propose to conduct an exploratory substudy of TB/HIV co-infected patients enrolled in an ongoing population-based TB research study in Botswana. We will identify and enroll 200 newly diagnosed TB patients on first-line therapy. We will collect sputum samples at enrollment and after 2 months of treatment. We will use deep sequencing of MTB DNA to look for heteroresistance. There are two specific aims to our proposal. Aim 1. We will determine whether direct sequencing from sputum specimen increases the detection of heteroresistant MTB infections compared to sequencing done on MTB culture samples. Aim 2. We will determine whether heteroresistant MTB infection status is predictive of response to TB treatment among patients on first-line TB therapy. This proposed research will be the first to systematically evaluate the use of deep sequencing to detect heteroresistant MTB infections, potentially improving clinical practice by allowing for rapid, early detection of heteroresistant infections and informing treatment decisions accordingly."
"9378732","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):          Chronic pain is an important, prevalent, and expensive condition that is difficult to treat. Modern  innovations in the field have dramatically increased the survival of combatants, but also increased the number of those surviving with chronic pain. Pain issues among active-duty military and Veterans have many unique features. In addition to battlefield injuries, greater exposure to trauma and psychological stress than the general public compounds the likelihood of developing chronic pain. Management of injury-related chronic pain may require a combination of approaches including local and systemic analgesic drugs, pain-directed physical therapy, behavior modification, biofeedback, and other interventions. An increasingly employed therapy in the management of Veterans with chronic pain is spinal cord stimulation (SCS). It has been shown in clinical studies to be safe and effective for properly selected patients and approved by the FDA to treat chronic pain of the trunk and limbs. SCS remains significantly under-utilized compared to either chronic opiates or surgical re- operation. The VHA has adopted routine screening and assessment of pain as well as planning for pain reduction as a national policy throughout the VHA health care system. SCS involves epidural implantation of a stimulation electrode connected to a small internal pacemaker. Activation of dorsal column (DC) fibers in the dermatomes associated with pain is often limited by the onset of discomfort associated with activation of nearby dorsal roots (DR). Successful SCS is thought to depend on activation of DC fibers without activation of DR fibers, which is termed selectivity. Predicting selectivity, and which patients will respond to the therapy, is currently only possible by doing an  invasive trial procedure, where an electrode is temporarily inserted and the patient is allowed to experience the neurostimulation and state whether it is helpful. Furthermore, due to the millions of possible stimulation parameters and varying patient anatomy, SCS programming can be time consuming, expensive, and result in aberrant stimulation. The objective of this proposal is to validate a patient-specific model that reliably predicts %DC/DR selective activation, by tailoring the dynamic range based on patient anatomy. This project is a collaboration with experts from VA Neurosurgery and the Bioengineering and Neurosurgery Departments at Duke University. It will focus on validating a patient-specific SCS model that reliably predicts activaton of neural elements responsible for pain relief, utilizing settings tailored to patient anatomy. A pilot clinical study demonstrating proof of concept has already been completed. This CSR&D Merit Award will expand upon this in a larger, mechanistic study in Veterans with existing SCS therapy. In Aim 1, each patient's existing preoperative MRI and postoperative X-ray images will be combined to construct a personalized, computational model based on patient-specific anatomy. Aim 2 will further demonstrate feasibility of models in maximizing selectivity, while reducing SCS programming times and improving clinical outcomes, by providing >50% reduction in pain from baseline. Successful completion of this proposal is expected based on the strength of the team and extensive preliminary data. This project will provide the data to justify broader clinical studies and development of a customized SCS software platform for the evaluation and treatment of chronic pain. The long-term goal of the project is to develop a novel platform that will lead to significant advances in the treatment of chronic pain for Veterans worldwide."
"9389467","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The candidate's short-term goal is to obtain a faculty position at an academic research institute; her long-term goal is to better understand the nature and molecular underpinnings of tumor-stroma crosstalk in pancreatic cancer, and to harness this improved understanding to treat the human disease. She intends to focus on pancreatic stellate cells, myofibroblast-like cells of the tumor microenvironment, and study how these unique lipid-storing cells interact with tumor cells to effect gene expression, metabolism, and growth. The candidate's background in cancer biology and gene expression analysis will be supplemented by the expertise in high-throughput sequencing and metabolic physiology in the lab and at the present institution to help her realize her goals. Further, the extensive mentorship experience of the advisor and the contributions of a well-balanced mentorship committee will enhance the candidate's scientific and professional development as she transitions to independence. The studies proposed here will evaluate novel mechanisms underlying PDAC tumor-stroma interactions with the following specific aims. Aim 1: Examine the role of stromal VDR/NF-kB crosstalk in PDAC desmoplasia and tumor growth. Recent data suggest that the vitamin D receptor (VDR) negatively regulates PSC activation, leading to reduced expression of pro-inflammatory genes in PSCs and decreased paracrine induction of factors that support tumor growth, by inhibiting NF-kB chromatin occupancy and target gene expression. The role of stromal VDR/NF-kB crosstalk will be examined in patient-derived PSC lines and in a new allograft model of PDAC featuring prominent desmoplasia. These experiments will determine the significance of these factors in the activation of key pathways known to regulate pancreatic cancer cell growth and metabolism. Aim 2: Understand the effect of PSC secreted factors on cancer cell lipid metabolism. Using recently developed systems for analysis of tumor-stroma crosstalk, the candidate will interrogate the link between lipid metabolism and gene expression, in the context of PSC secreted factors. Preliminary data suggest that PSCs secrete factors that foster the recently established fatty acid scavenging phenotype of Kras- transformed cells while providing signaling modulators that impact the availability of acetyl-CoA as a substrate for histone acetylation. The results from these studies will be useful in understanding the unique metabolic properties of PDAC cells. Aim 3: Evaluate paracrine regulation of redox homeostasis by PDAC stromal cues.  The contribution of structural and diffusible features of the tumor stroma will be assessed in tumor cells faced with cellular stress relevant to the tumor microenvironment.  These studies will help to define the nature of paracrine pro-survival pathways that contribute to redox balance in the neoplastic compartment, and that may serve as new therapeutic targets. Together, the proposed experiments will probe previously unexplored aspects of PDAC biology, with the potential to uncover novel vulnerabilities for therapeutic intervention."
"9486844","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Helicobacter pylori infects the stomach of half of the world's population. This infection is a primary cause of peptic ulcer disease and a high risk factor for gastric cancer. Therefore, eradication of H. pylori infection leads to ulcer healing and lowers the risk of gastric cancer. Unil the discovery of H. pylori, it was thought that stomach acid presented an inhospitable environment for bacterial infection. However, H. pylori has uniquely developed the means of surviving and growing on the acidic surface of the human stomach, a process termed acid acclimation. Disruption of this process leads to loss of survival in acid; therefore, the components of this process would provide novel targets for eradication therapy. Current eradication therapies require the use of antibiotics along with acid-inhibitory drugs. The successful eradication by these therapies is decreasing because of increasing antibiotic resistance, resulting in a response rate of ~70% in the USA.  The growth-dependent antibiotics clarithromycin or amoxicillin are not effective unless bacteria are in growth phase. Improving acid inhibition should improve therapeutic outcome. In the first aim, we hypothesize that inhibition of acid secretion increases the number of bacteria in growth phase, making them sensitive to growth-dependent antibiotics, necessitating the requirement for administration of acid-inhibitory compounds, in addition to antibiotics for successful eradication. The finding that slow omeprazole metabolizers respond with much improved acid control and effective eradication with omeprazole and amoxicillin alone, suggests that improved acid inhibition increases the sensitivity of the organism to growth-dependent antibiotics.  From this it follows that, with more consistent and greater elevation of intragastric pH, more organisms are in the antibiotic-sensitive growth phase rather than the resistant stationary phase. Maintenance of an elevated pH for both day and night should put almost all H. pylori in growth phase. Therefore, the effect of profound acid inhibition on the bactericidal effect of amoxicillin will be tested in ivo in the gerbil.  UreI, a proton-gated urea channel, forms an inner membrane complex at least with urease and the Ni2+ insertion subunits. Formation of this complex and interaction of other proteins that comprise the complex will be identified using state-of-the-art MS/MS techniques. The novel crystal structure of UreI will be used to identify the cytoplasmic loop binding sites of the proteins interacting with the channel. In the future, the loops identified as essential can be exploited for the development of novel and specific inhibitors of UreI complex formation. Successful completion of this aim could lead to an H. pylori-specific mono-therapy for eradication."
"9378699","Objectives: Sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) is strongly associated with many aspects of military service including blast injury. The overall objectives of this proposal are to improve the prevention and treatment of SNHL in veterans. Research Design: During the previous period of funding, using medium-throughput screening of hair cells (HCs) from the mammalian cochlea, we identified a number of novel antioxidants and cell signaling inhibitors that are capable of protecting cochlear HCs from high-dose ototoxic damage. Some of these protectants provided better protection than several previously described oto- protectants. We now propose to evaluate the most effective of these compounds in vivo, using a single, invariant model of noise-induced hearing loss in animals, so that the interventions can be strictly compared. We will also evaluate known HC protectants to provide benchmarks. This will allow us to identify optimal compounds for further development as pharmacological interventions in humans. Methodology: Studies will be performed using in vivo studies of noise damage to the cochlea, with intracochlear delivery of HC protectants beginning immediately after exposure. We will use a well- established mouse model of noise damage, delivery of compounds to cochlear perilymph with osmotic minipumps, serial auditory brainstem response (ABR) and distortion product otoacoustic emission (DPOAE) audiometry, and morphological evaluation of cochlear HCs and afferent nerve endings. Progress over the past period of funding: During the past period of funding, we developed a medium-throughput method for screening libraries of potential oto-protectants using the mammalian organ of Corti, the only tissue containing the damage-sensitive mammalian outer HCs. We identified several antioxidants and several cell-signaling pathway inhibitors that were highly effective, and had not previously been evaluated for HC protection. Using an electroporation model of organ of Corti transfection, we also screened more than 200 transcription factors for the ability to enhance HC regeneration caused by ATOH1 expression in nonsensory cells, discovering several novel factors with this ability. We discovered that gene therapy with espin1 dramatically enhanced stereocilia formation on regenerating HCs. Finally, we discovered a novel protective HC pathway mediated by ATP receptors that reduce activity in HCs at high stimulus levels, protecting them from noise damage. These studies resulted in 20 peer-reviewed publications to date. Clinical Relationship: The prevention and treatment of SNHL is of great importance to veterans and the VA. The effects of SNHL on veterans' quality of life are substantial. SNHL and tinnitus also account for more disability compensation in the VA than any other disorder, and rehabilitation costs are high. The proposed research is targeted at developing new and improved therapies for prevention and treatment of this important health problem."
"9487858","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Background/Rationale: We now have established that NEU1 sialidase is expressed in human lung microvascular endothelial cell (HPMEC)s, where it associates with and desialylates CD31, also known as platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule (PECAM)-1. Further, NEU1 disrupts CD31-driven HPMEC capillary- like tube formation or in vitro angiogenesis. NEU1 requires association with its own chaperone//transport protein, protective protein/cathepsin A (PPCA), for full catalytic activity. We hypothesize that during barrier formation and angiogenesis, as HPMECs engage each other and the CD31-ectodomain (ED)s homophilically interact, the cytoplasmic adapter protein, TNFa Receptor-Associated Factor (TRAF)6, physically associates with and activates one or more src family kinase (SFK)s, which in turn, increases tyrosine phosphorylation of p120 catenin. This phosphoprotein facilitates recruitment of NEU1, most likely accompanied by PPCA, to CD31, permitting removal of sialic acid residues from the CD31-ED and disruption of CD31-driven angiogenesis. Increased NEU1 expression may contribute to the pathogenesis of lung diseases, including Idiopathic pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF). Objective(s): 1. To define the CD31 domain(s) required for its recruitment of NEU1 and/or PPCA in human lung microvascular endothelia. 2. To define the mechanism(s) through which the adapter protein, TRAF6, in concert with one or more SFK(s), regulate NEU1 recruitment to CD31. 3. To define the mechanism(s) through which NEU1 sialidase regulates in vitro EC capillary-like tube formation and in vivo angiogenesis. 4. To establish patterns of NEU1 expression and catalytic activity in the lung tissues of normal subjects and patients with Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF). Methods: A primary HPMEC system in which NEU1, PPCA, ST6GAL-I, CD31, SFKs, TRAF6, and p120ctn will be manipulated through siRNA technology or infection with adenoviral vectors encoding for wild-type and catalytically-dead NEU1, PPCA, ST6GAL-I, and wild-type and dominant-negative TRAF6. Lung microvascular ECs harvested from wild-type, NEU1-/-, and CD31-/- mice with and without gene rescue will also be studied. Protein-protein interactions will be studied with co-immunoprecipitation, GST-fusion protein pull-down, and Far Western blotting/gel-overlay assays. Finally, angiogenesis will be measured on Matrigel in vitro, and in mice implanted with HPMECs in which expression of NEU1, CD31, SFK(s), TRAF6, and/or p120ctn, have been manipulated. NEU1 mRNA and protein expression will be quantified in lung tissues from IPF patients. Findings/Results: We have established that in postconfluent HPMECs, NEU1 sialidase is recruited to and desialylates CD31.The NEU1-CD31 association is both TRAF6- and SFK-dependent and p120ctn is involved. NEU1 overexpression reduces EC adhesion to extracellular matrix, restrains EC migration into a wound, and impairs in vitro angiogenesis in a CD31-dependent manner. ST6GAL-I counteracts the NEU1 effect. NEU1 expression is increased in the pulmonary vascular endothelium of IPF patients. Status: This project will explore new concepts that are not an extension of any previously funded project(s). Impact: If our proposed studies are successfully completed, they will generate a paradigm shift in which NEU1 can be selectively recruited to specific receptor(s), to regulate their sialylation state(s) and responsiveness. Increased NEU1 expression may mechanistically contribute to IPF pathophysiology."
"9547584","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)    The long-term goal of this project is to understand the molecular mechanism by which DNA mismatch repair (MMR) maintains to genomic stability. MMR plays an important role in replication fidelity by correcting mispairs generated during DNA replication. Mismatch recognition protein hMutS?, a heterodimer consisting of hMSH2 and hMSH6 subunits, is arguably the most important component in MMR. The hMSH6 subunit contains a PCNA interaction protein motif (called PIP box) and a PWWP domain at its N-terminus. While no clear function has been assigned to the PWWP domain, the PIP box was previously thought to be involved in recruiting hMutS? to mismatched DNA. Interestingly, recent studies have shown that depletion of the PIP box only moderately increases mutation frequencies, and does not affect hMutS? chromatin localization. Surprisingly, we show recently that the MSH6 PWWP domain physically interacts with histone mark H3K36me3 and is responsible for localizing hMutS? to replicating chromatin. These observations suggest that the PCNA-hMSH6 interaction is not for hMutS? recruitment and that the epigenetic H3K36me3 histone mark plays a critical role in MMR and genomic stability. Given the abundance of H3K36me3 in S phase and that PCNA interacts with both hMutS? and replicative DNA polymerases ? and ?, we hypothesize that the H3K36me3-hMutS? interaction in individual nucleosomes determines mutation rates in the corresponding DNA sequences, and that the PCNA-hMutS? interaction coordinates the DNA replication and MMR reactions at the replication fork. To test these hypotheses, three specific aims are proposed. Specific aim 1 is to determine genome-wide distributions of and interactions between H3K36me3 and hMutS? by ChIP- Seq analysis. Specific aim 2 is to study molecular details as to how the PCNA-hMutS? interaction regulates DNA synthesis and MMR. Specific aim 3 is to determine the impact of hMutS? interactions with H3K36me3 and PCNA on gene mutations using Exome-Sequencing analysis and a mutagenesis assay, respectively. A successful completion of the proposed study will not only elucidate novel mechanisms by which MMR maintains genome stability, but also provide potentially new biomarkers for cancer detection and therapy."
"9323832","Project Abstract: South Carolina Department of Agriculture The South Carolina Department of Agriculture (SCDA) is seeking funding support for personnel, travel, training, equipment and supply costs needed to implement a comprehensive and integrated food protection plan that will meet the objectives of the Manufactured Food Regulatory Program Standards (MFRPS). SCDA Consumer Protection Division (CPD) has been involved in the process of MFRPS compliance since 2008. The primary obstacle impeding SCDA in achieving compliance to the Standards has been limitations in staffing levels. To overcome this barrier, this proposal for a Cooperative Agreement includes funding for two additional full time employees (Year One) to be exclusively dedicated to the successful development of a MFRPS program. To reach MFRPS compliance within five years, the SCDA will hire one full time MFRPS Program Coordinator to manage all programmatic activities related to MFRPS, including but not limited to the development of a strategic action plan, improved stakeholder communications, educational outreach to industry, audit assistance and enforcement support, improvement of the Department?s ability to coordinate trace back/trace forward efforts, and outbreak communications with the public. A second full time Administrative Assistant position to support the activities of the MFRPS Program Coordinator will also be added to the current staff through the proposed funding. The person in this position will be expected to execute the efficient tracking of inspections, complaints, audit findings, trainings, outreach activities, and any other related information of this program. Achieving conformance with the MFRPS will enable the SCDA to ensure that national standardized food safety objectives are met and that SCDA has staff and resources to both enforce and advance these objectives."
"9283290","Project Summary / Abstract  Despite advances in immunosuppression and routine PRA screening prior to transplantation, acute and  chronic antibody-mediated rejection (AMR) undermine long-term survival of transplanted organs. The success  of therapies targeting AMR in transplant patients is limited by the incomplete understanding of the mechanisms  underlying DSA and autoantibody generation and functions. Previous studies of humoral responses following  transplantation were impeded by the lack of reliable assays to detect allo- and autoreactive B cells and by the  paucity of physiologically relevant animal models of AMR. Production of pathogenic allo- and autoantibodies  requires interactions between B cells and activated helper CD4 T cells. The T cell repertoire of many humans  includes alloreactive memory T cells that are resistant to immunosuppression or costimulatory blockade.  During the previous funding cycle, we demonstrated that memory CD4 T cells induce superior donor-specific  alloantibody (DSA) responses compared to primary effector CD4 T cells. We have developed physiologically  and clinically relevant mouse models of acute and chronic AMR to investigate the mechanisms of allo- and  autoantibody generation after kidney transplantation. Our preliminary data show that donor-reactive memory  CD4 T cells induce robust DSA and autoantibody responses in renal allograft recipients resulting in acute  AMR. In contrast to de novo DSA, autoantibody generation is not prevented by anti-CD20 antibody treatment  and is associated with chronic graft tissue injury. The goal of this project is to determine helper signals required  for generation of pathogenic allo- and autoantibodies and to use this information to inhibit AMR in sensitized  renal allograft recipients. We hypothesize that the molecular requirements for allo- and autoantibody  production following renal transplantation and the specificity and pathogenicity of resulting antibody are  determined by the functional phenotype of helper CD4 T cells and by the intensity of post-transplant  inflammation. We will test this hypothesis in three Specific Aims:  Aim 1. To determine helper requirements for the production and maintenance of donor MHC class I- and MHC  class II-specific DSA and collagen IV- and fibronectin-specific autoantibodies in renal transplant recipients.  Aim 2. To test the role of BAFF/APRIL cytokine network during the generation of pathogenic allo- and  autoantibodies in renal allograft recipients.  Aim 3. To test the effects of post-transplant inflammation on the generation of allo- and autoantibodies  following renal transplantation."
"9486827","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):           Stroke is a common affliction among veterans, and treatments are few. Work by our labs and those of our collaborators' have focused on the protective potential of heat shock proteins, namely, the highly inducible 70 kD heat shock protein (HSP70). HSP70 appears to have cytoprotective properties by nature of its chaperone functions, presumably leading to enhancement of nascent protein folding and prevention of protein aggregation. However, work in related fields has shown that HSPs appear to positively influence many aspects of ischemic cell death. We previously showed that overexpression of HSP70 or its pharmacological induction protects by inhibiting inflammation and upregulating the anti-apoptotic protein, Bcl-2. Others have shown the HSP70 blocks apoptosis by preventing cytochrome c release from the mitochondria or inhibiting caspase activation. Through collaborative work with Dr. Jong Eun Lee (Yonsei University, S. Korea), we identified dynamin as one protein substantially suppressed by HSP70 overexpression. Dynamin is a GTPase involved in receptor- mediated endocytosis through detaching clathrin-coated vesciles from the plasma membrane. Its role in ischemic brain cell death is completely unknown, but has been implicated in facilitating apoptosis by trafficking the death receptor Fas to the cell surface. In this application, we propose to further explore these observations that HSP70 protects the brain against stroke by interfering with dynamin export of Fas, and to address the implications of dynamin as a therapeutic target. Specific aim 1: Determine whether dynamin inhibition is protective, and if its suppression is linked to protection by HSP70. Specific aim 2: Determine whether there is a link between dynamin, fas and dynamin inhibition by HSP70. Specific aim 3: Determine how HSP70 regulates dynamin expression and/or function."
"9487888","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a multifaceted disorder precipitated by exposure to a psychologically distressing event. Although, diagnostic symptoms for PTSD include hyperarousal, re-experiencing (flashbacks/nightmares), and avoidance, sleep disruptions are considered to be the hallmarks of PTSD. PTSD affects a large proportion of military personnel and veterans and is associated with numerous deleterious outcomes for veterans and active duty service personnel. The costs of PTSD to the individual and society at large are substantial. PTSD is characterized by impairments in fear and extinction learning whereby the perceived threat continues even when acute danger is no longer present and stimuli that are reminiscent of those that occurred during the trauma continue to provoke fear and alarm. Convincing evidence suggests that sleep is critical for fear learning and consolidation of extinction memories. However, it is yet unclear as to how or what sleep factor regulates fear and extinction learning. Recent studies implicate melanin concentrating hormone (MCH), a neuropeptide, in sleep regulation and in learning and memory consolidation. Thus, we asked: Does MCH have a role in pathogenesis of PTSD? Since PTSD is characterized by dysfunctional fear and extinction learning, we hypothesize that MCH may play a critical role in fear and extinction learning. We will use mice as our animal model and expose them to predator odor to induce contextual fear conditioning. We predict that a) mice exposed to predator odor will develop contextual fear conditioning and display fear, stress and protracted sleep disruptions; b) exposure to predator odor will activate brain regions associated with fear learning. We will use the cutting edge Designer Receptors Exclusively Activated by Designer Drug (DREADD) technology to selectively inhibit MCH neurons. We predict that inhibition of MCH neurons or blockade of MCH transmission, via selective MCH-1 receptor antagonist will attenuate fear learning. However, inhibition of MCH neurons coupled with local activation of MCH transmission in the hippocampus or amygdala will override the effects of MCH inhibition resulting in the development of contextual fear conditioning. We predict that extinction learning, after predator odor trauma, will activate infralimbic cortex, the brain region associated with extinction, and attenuate fear learning. However, inhibition of MCH neurons or selective blockade of MCH transmission in the infralimbic cortex during extinction training will attenuate extinction learnin. Overall, our project is innovative, translational and very relevant to VA care and mission."
"9473263","Current therapies for autoimmune diseases target the symptoms rather than the cause of autoimmunity. The chronic use of immunosuppressants leads to deliberating side effects. An attractive alternative is to treat the underlying cause by boosting regulatory T cells (Tregs) in patients with autoimmunity. Our group established that IL-2 is an essential cytokine for Tregs. Moreover, we have established in pre-clinical studies that low IL-2R signaling promotes Tregs but not T effector/memory (TEM) cells. This finding has led to the notion that low-dose (LD) IL-2 may selectively expand Tregs. Importantly, LD IL-2 therapy has shown promising results in patients with chronic GvHD, HCV vasculitis, and several autoimmune diseases. Correspondingly, several fundamental questions emerge about LD IL-2 immunotherapy. These include: What is the selectivity of LD IL-2 for Tregs? What is the mechanism by which Tregs preferentially respond to low levels of IL-2? Is there individual variation in responsiveness to LD IL-2? What are the molecular consequences in Treg and Teff cells in response to LD IL-2? Does chronic exposure to LD IL-2 alter the capacity of Tregs to respond to IL-2? Our supporting data has defined a window of selectivity of human Tregs for IL-2R signaling when compared to CD45RO CD4 TEM ++ cells. However, the extent that Tregs exclusive respond to LD IL-2 remains a point of contention. We also have preliminary data that IL-2-dependent gene activation in Tregs may vary in normal subjects. This latter point is of interest because some individuals may be more suitable candidates for this therapy. We plan to build on these results and capitalize on our expertise on IL-2 to better understand mechanistically the potential of LD IL- 2 as a treatment platform for autoimmune diseases. The premise of this application is: In comparison to TEM cells, low levels of IL-2R signaling selectively and substantially activates an IL-2-dependent transcriptional program in Tregs that is uniquely shaped by TCR and co-stimulatory signaling; this selective gene activation varies between individuals and accounts for variable responses to LD IL-2 therapy. The following specific aims are proposed to address this premise: 1) To establish the immediate and down-stream consequences of IL-2R signaling by LD IL-2 on gene regulation in human Treg and Teff cells in vitro alone or in the context of TCR and co-stimulatory signaling; 2) to evaluate cellular and molecular levels through which the response by human Tregs varies to LD IL-2 in normal subjects and in patients with Type 1 diabetes; and 3) to evaluate the consequence of IL-2 in Treg and TEM cells in patients undergoing LD IL-2 therapy. These experiments will assess the outcome of IL-2R signaling due to variation of IL-2 dose and the type of autoimmune disease."
"9490986","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PDA) is a deadly disease characterized by late diagnosis, aggressive invasion of surrounding tissues, and early metastasis. Patients with stage 1A disease have a 30% 5 year survival rate following resection, highlighting that PDA metastasizes early in patients, however, the molecular mechanisms driving early metastasis in PDA are not understood. We have recently found that the majority of human pancreatic adenocarcinomas have elevated expression of the Ataxia-Telangiectasia Group D Associated (ATDC) gene and that ATDC has an oncogenic function in pancreatic cancer through Wnt pathway activation and ?-catenin stabilization. Using newly created genetically engineered mouse models of pancreatic cancer, we have now identified a previously unknown role for ATDC in pancreatic cancer, where ATDC is upregulated during the early PanIN stage of tumorigenesis, and in the presence of oncogenic Kras, accelerates PanIN progression and the development of invasive and metastatic tumors. ATDC upregulates CD44 in mouse and human PanIN lesions through a ?-catenin-induced mechanism, resulting in the induction of an epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) phenotype characterized by expression of Zeb1 and Snail1. Knockdown of ATDC blocks invasion in mouse and human PDA cells and this effect is mediated through ?-catenin and CD44. In this proposal, we hypothesize that ATDC is a proximal regulator of EMT and drives progression and metastasis of pancreatic cancer, thus serving as an important therapeutic target. To dissect the role of ATDC in pancreatic cancer, we will: 1) investigate the role of ATDC in pancreatic tumorigenesis using novel genetically engineered mouse models; 2) characterize the molecular mechanisms by which ATDC induces an invasive phenotype in PDA; and 3) determine the mechanism of ATDC upregulation in pancreatic cancer."
"9604852","PROJECT SUMMARY  The University of North Alabama (UNA) Industrial Hygiene (IH) Program is currently one of four baccalaureate programs in the US accredited by ASAC of ABET. The UNA IH Program offers a double major in IH and general chemistry and has earned a reputation for graduating a pool of qualified industrial hygienist who are providing valuable services to workers and employers in this geographical region and beyond. Enrollment in the program continues to trend upward with a record number of graduates (15) the previous academic year. The continuation of the NIOSH Training Project Grant (TPG) is essential to remain effective in recruiting and retaining students with good scholastic merits, to maintain the current expectations of academic quality, and to expand into new and promising foreseeable opportunities. Therefore, the objectives of this proposal for the continuation of the NIOSH-TPG are threefold: promote the recruitment of qualified students in the OH&S field; support the efforts of continuous academic improvement; and expand the educational opportunities and services of the IH Program.  Recruitment will be promoted by academic scholarships (NIOSH TPG and departmental) and planned activities to reach potential candidates including underrepresented racial and ethnic groups (mailings; presentations; and participation in internal and external recruitment events). Continuous improvement will be approached by periodic evaluations of program objectives, annual evaluations of educational outcomes, and timely correction of shortcomings. Educational opportunities will be sought after in support of the new, four-year degrees in Engineering Technology (within the Department of Engineering Technology) and Earth Systems Sustainability (within the Department of Physics and Earth Science) at UNA.  The NIOSH TPG has been pivotal in supporting this baccalaureate program in IH housed at a regional university. From dismal enrollment figures that threatened its viability, the UNA IH program blossomed into a successful academic program that is often highlighted as exemplary by UNA administrators and noticed by stakeholders as an effective contributor to the advancement of OH&S. The discontinuation of this grant may certainly halt the continuous path of success and affect our ability to recruit students, particularly those academically gifted students who we have seen populating our program over the years."
"9378390","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):          The U.S. Veteran population suffers from high rates of depression and significant mental health symptom burden. Sadly, suicide rates reflect this as well, being significantly higher for Veterans relative to the non-Veteran populations. Therefore, a critical need exists to identify the complex gene x environment interactions and the underlying neural substrates that drive the pathogenesis of depression. Clinical observations abound associating reduced brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) expression with depression and increased BDNF expression with effective antidepressant responses. Rodent models have reliably confirmed those associations, and revealed important mechanistic roles for hippocampal BDNF expression in the response to antidepressant drugs. However, the neurobiological mechanisms by which reduced BDNF expression might engender vulnerability to the development of depression remain unclear. The existence of a high frequency polymorphism of the bdnf gene (Val66Met; allelic frequency 20- 35%) in humans that reduces BDNF protein levels makes this a highly relevant biomedical problem that needs to be addressed. Inflammation or chronic stress, as environmental precipitants of depression represent an ideal context to conduct translationally relevant mechanism based experiments aimed at understanding this gene x environment interaction. Our exciting new preliminary data, in both human and mouse model systems, suggest that BDNF may play an important negative regulatory role on microglial activation state, and disruption of the BDNF system sensitizes mice to the development of inflammation or stress-induced depressive-like behavior. The experiments proposed in this application will utilize two of the quintessential mouse models of environmentally-induced depressive-like behavior and novel methodology in a human postmortem system to better understand the interactions between the BDNF system and microglia activation state in relation to depression scores and prefrontal cortical (PFC)- dependent symptom profiles (e.g. impulsivity, cognitive flexibility and attention).  We propose to test the hypothesis that BDNF deficiency induces vulnerability to development of PFC- dependent depressive-like behaviors as a direct result of increased microglial reactivity and neurotoxic tryptophan metabolism. If successful, the new experimental data that emerge from these experiments can be immediately `reverse translated' to the clinic to develop novel diagnostic and therapeutic approaches for vulnerable patients."
"9486831","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):           Elevated levels of glucose and/or lipids in Type 2 diabetes (T2DM) are thought to negatively affect islet function and survival (so-called `glucotoxicity', `lipotoxicity', or `gluco-lipotoxiciy'), leading to a further impairment of insulin secretion and worsening glycemic control. However, much of the evidence for glucotoxicity or lipotoxicity has come from studies of rodent islets or rodent models of T2DM (ob/ob, db/db, ZDF, high-fat diet, etc.). This is problematic because human islets have critical differences from rodent islets. Thus, our understanding of the mechanistic events in human islets exposed to excess glucose and lipid in vivo is quite limited. These fundamental gaps in our knowledge, which are partly the result of experimental limitations of studying human islets in vivo and partly from limitations in our knowledge of human islet biology, restrict our ability to develop interventions to preserve beta cell function. To address these limitations, we developed new pre-clinical, experimental approaches that allow mechanistic analysis of human islets exposed to excess glucose and/or lipid in vivo (human islets transplanted into immunodeficient mice). Based on our in vivo and in vitro data, we hypothesize that excess glucose and/or lipid in vivo (glucotoxicity or lipotoxicity) compromises the function and/or expression of these key islet-enriched transcription factors in human islets, leading to impaired insulin secretion and biosynthesis and the worsening islet function in T2DM. We propose three aims to test this hypothesis: 1) Define the degree, duration, and mechanism(s) by which hyperglycemia alters human islet function in vivo. 2) Determine whether excess lipid worsens the effects of hyperglycemia on human islet function in vivo. 3) Determine whether excess glucose and/or lipid impair human islet function in vivo by similar or distinct mechanisms. The proposed studies bring together new information and technologies related to islet-enriched transcription factors and human islet biology, as well as new experimental models that allow for human islets to be studied in vivo in ways that have not previously been possible. The proposed studies address a critical problem in T2DM, namely the molecular mechanisms of glucotoxicity and/or lipotoxicity, and should drive new efforts to design interventions to preserve  or improve beta cell function."
"9486882","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):           Exposure to a traumatic event that causes extreme fear, horror or helplessness can lead to anxiety disorders, such as posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), which can often be co-morbid with depression. Female Veterans who experienced Military Sexual Trauma (MST) are particularly at risk for a wide range of trauma- related mental and physical health problems including PTSD, depression, anxiety, chronic pain, sleep disturbances, substance abuse, wide-ranging physical symptoms, and negative health behaviors. Individual patients can vary in the degree to which they present with the different symptom clusters, such that a one size fits all treatment is often inadequate. This individual variation may be associated with biological risk factors that increase vulnerability to the disorder or impede treatment. While neurobiological factors (e.g., hormones, genomics) interact to increase an individual's risk of developing PTSD, it is unclear how the underlying neurobiology is shaped by these factors to result in the observed dysregulations. PTSD is marked by impaired cortical control of the limbic system, specifically the amygdala and hippocampus. Fear conditioning approaches have provided robust brain-based phenotypes of PTSD risk regardless of trauma type, as it is observed in both civilian and combat PTSD populations. The proposed study will capitalize on this observable marker and individual variability among women with MST to investigate the neurobiological underpinnings of PTSD as well as the utility of this phenotype to predict treatment response. Using state-of-the art molecular-genetic approaches with a mechanistic understanding of fear circuitry will offer tremendous insight into individual differences in risk and resilience to traum. Fear responses will be observed using a validated fear-potentiated startle paradigm that allows investigators to assess the acquisition, extinction, and return of conditioned fear responses. Hormonal contributions to heightened fear responding will be investigated by measuring estrogen variation in the female Veteran population to be included in this study. The ADCYAP1R1 gene, which codes for the type 1 receptor (PAC1) for pituitary adenylate cyclase activating polypeptide (PACAP) is one of the leading candidate genes related to PTSD in traumatized women. This genetic polymorphism was identified using a hypothesis neutral genomic convergence approach, but has since been replicated in several different PTSD study populations. The proposed project will include the examination of PAC1 genotype, methylation status, mRNA expression, and estrogen variation on PTSD symptom expression as well as laboratory measures of fear and anxiety in an understudied population of female Veterans. Lastly, we will evaluate the predictive nature of the neurobiological indices to be included in the  proposed work as they relate to PTSD treatment outcome within the Trauma Recovery Program at the Atlanta VAMC."
"9487132","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Cognitive impairment has been identified as a type 2 diabetes (T2D) complication. T2D has consistently been associated with increased risk for dementia and cognitive decline. Our recent studies suggest biological mechanisms through which this risk can be remedied. Diabetic persons treated with both insulin and other hypoglycemic medications, but not with either agent alone, have significantly less Alzheimer's Disease (AD) neuropathology than matched non- diabetic persons. The insulin receptor signaling pathway (IRSP) is a promising and biologically plausible mechanism by which the treatment of diabetes with combination therapy might affect the neurobiological substrates of cognitive impairment and dementia in elderly persons with and without diabetes. Studies examining the brain IRSP in diabetes and AD show that its functioning is significantly altered. This study will build on the experience of the JJ Peters VAMC and Mount Sinai School of Medicine Brain Bank and the neurobiology laboratories at the JJP-VAMC. Brain gene (Aim 1) and protein (Aim 2) expression studies of several key mediators and effectors in the IRSP (e.g., IR, IGF-1R, IRS1, IRS2, AKT1-3, GSK3?, FOXO1, and ?-Catenin), in postmortem brain specimens (superior temporal gyrus, hippocampus and occipital cortex), will compare diabetic subjects treated with combination therapy to matched diabetic subjects treated with insulin only, hypoglycemic medication only, and to non-diabetic subjects with and without AD-dementia. Relationships of expression alterations with cognitive-impairment-associated neuropathologies (A? and tau) will also be explored (Aim 3). To establish cause and effect relationships we will compare 8 groups of mice: combination therapy, insulin, metformin, or neither, in Tg2576 mice fed a high fat diet to induce insulin resistance (AD and T2D mouse models) or WT. Identifying brain molecular-biological pathways affected in diabetes and altered/restored by combination therapy is crucial to the translation of clinicopathological result to the development of treatment strategies for cognitive compromise in elderly Veterans with and without diabetes and to the promotion of their successful aging. The public health impact of this investigation to our Veterans is highlighted by the increasing prevalences of both diabetes and dementia, which are expected to dramatically accelerate as the proportion of elderly Veteran increases."
"9487115","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):          Coronary heart disease is the single leading cause of death among men and women in the United States. Coronary revascularization, including coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is the most common modality in patients with coronary diseases. However, it is also among the most costly, and is often associated with a high incidence of restenosis. Although the rate of restenosis is significantly reduced with the use of bare-metal stent (BMS) and particularly with drug-eluting stent (DES), a persistently high rate of restenosis after BMS and an increased risk of in-stent thrombosis with DES have been encountered as significant limitations to the long-term efficacy of coronary revascularization. With a long-term goal of identifying novel therapeutic targets for coronary heart disease, the current application specifically investigates a potentially critical role of calcium independent phospholipase A2b (iPLA2b) in vascular inflammation, re-endothelialization, and neointima formation in a mouse femoral artery wire injury model. iPLA2b is a member of the phospholipase A2 superfamily that acts on phospholipids to produce a free fatty acid and a lysophospholipid. iPLA2b is expressed in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) and is implicated in many human diseases. Whereas little is known about the role of other PLA2 in vascular injury-induced neointima formation, substantial evidence, including pharmacological inhibition, antisense oligonucleotide down- rgulation, genetic deletion, and smooth muscle-specific overexpression, consistently demonstrated that iPLA2b plays a critical role in vascular inflammation and neointima formation in a mouse carotid artery ligation model. To investigate whether targeting smooth muscle-specific iPLA2b is sufficient to reduce vascular inflammation and neointima formation, a femoral artery injury model that better mimics PCI was established, a novel tamoxifen-inducible smooth muscle-specific iPLA2b knockout mouse model (SM-iPLA2b-iKO) was developed, and the current proposal hypothesizes that activation of iPLA2b in VSMC by vascular injury plays a key role in wire injury-induced vascular inflammation, re-endothelialization, and neointima formation, thereby significantly contributing to the development of restenosis after coronary revascularization. Three Specific Aims are:  1) To test the hypothesis that smooth muscle-specific iPLA2b plays a critical role in the initiation of vascular inflammation, re-endothelialization, and neointima formation; 2) To determine the molecular mechanism that underlies wire injury-induced iPLA2b activation, vascular inflammation, and neointima formation; 3) To investigate whether post-wire injury molecular and genetic targeting iPLA2b has an effect on the progression of re-endothelialization, vascular inflammation, and neointima formation. To achieve this goal, a well established and most physiological relevant femoral artery wire injury model will be used in combination with several novel and established genetic animal models (SM- iPLA2b-iKO, SM-HIF-1a-iKO, and SM-iPLA2b-Tg/12/15-LO) to selectively inhibit or activate iPLA2b, HIF-1a, and 12/15-LO before and after wire injury. Injured and non-injured femoral arteries will be isolated and then subjected to molecular, immunohistological, and biochemical studies to determine the role of iPLA2b in vascular inflammation and neointima formation. Results from the proposed studies may modify the current paradigm that the initiation and early progression of vascular inflammation are largely attributed to coordinated interactions among monocytes/macrophages, leukocytes, and endothelial cells by providing the first direct experimental evidence that VSMC also play a critical role in these early key events. Importantly, results from the proposed studies will elucidate specific mechanisms that could lead to the identification of iPLA2b as a novel potential therapeutic target for the prevention and treatment of vascular inflammation, re- endothelialization, neointima formation, and restenosis."
"9487105","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Cigarette smoke (CS) suppresses the immune system, and smoking is the major risk factor for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Exposure to cigarette smoke is associated with a significant increase in the risk for respiratory viral infections. Our work is to understand how CS compromises the human innate immune system's response to influenza virus infection, and to find novel methods to control the infection. Epidemiological studies show that influenza infection is seven times more common and is much more severe in smokers than nonsmokers. Retinoic acid-inducible protein I (RIG-I) plays an important role in the recognition of, and cytokine induction by, influenza virus and other RNA viruses. Our previous studies, using an ex vivo human organ culture model, have found that cigarette smoke extract (CSE) suppresses antiviral and innate immune responses in influenza virus infected human lung through oxidative inhibition of viral-mediated induction of the pattern recognition receptor, RIG-I. This immunosuppressive effect of CS may play a role in the enhanced susceptibility of smokers to serious influenza infection in the lung. We propose to use an in vivo mouse model to study the mechanism by which CS suppresses the expression and function of the RIG-I initiated innate response to influenza virus. The hypothesis of this proposal is that long-term CS impairs the protective RIG-I initiated antiviral response to influenza virus in vivo while RIG-I overexpression and antioxidants provide therapeutic inhibition of immunosuppression from smoking.  To test the central hypothesis, we propose to pursue the following integrated specific aims: AIM 1: Is RIG-I knockdown by CS responsible for the suppression of the RIG-I initiated antiviral response in CS-exposed mice? AIM 2: Can RIG-I overexpression in mouse lung reverse the CS-mediated suppression of the antiviral response in CS-exposed mice? AIM 3: Can antioxidants restore the RIG-I initiated antiviral response in CS-exposed mice?  These studies will significantly enhance our understanding of the mechanism whereby CS suppresses the human immune system and predisposes humans to worse outcomes of influenza virus infection. Determination of the molecular mechanisms of immunosuppression will be important in designing strategies for the development of new and novel treatments for cigarette smoke enhanced lung infections, particularly those due to influenza."
"9447754","PROJECT SUMMARY A major limiting factor to the development of successful subunit vaccines against emerging pathogens is the lack of effective and safe immune adjuvants. Biomaterials immunoengineering is a nascent field that is generating promising avenues for the development of subunit vaccines against infectious diseases, cancers, and autoimmune disorders. Peptide based biomaterials are attractive due to their biocompatibility, ability to fold into specific structures, ease of synthesis, and the rich chemistry with which the primary sequence can be manipulated to control the immunomodulatory properties. We are interested in the development of self- assembling peptide biomaterials for applications in vaccine development and immunotherapies. In the current project, we will develop novel self-assembling heterochiral peptide biomaterials that engage mechanisms of autophagy for applications in vaccine development against mosquito-borne flaviviruses such as West Nile (WNV). In aim 1, we will synthesize peptides with various patterns of chiral amino acids and investigate the assembly, morphology, structure, and bulk material properties such as viscoelasticity and proteolytic stability. In Aim 2, we will investigate how chirality-induced changes in the physicochemical properties of peptide biomaterials impact mechanisms of autophagy, adjuvant potency, and antibody responses using model antigens or peptide and protein antigens derived from WNV. We will deliver antigenic peptides or protein domains from viruses via covalent linkage or shear-thinned with peptide hydrogels and investigate antibody responses, affinity, and neutralization capacity. In aim 3, we will test protection from WNV challenge and neuroinvasion in mouse models and assess translational capacity of peptide biomaterials using Japanese encephalitis antigens for which inactivated human vaccines are available to serve as controls. Completion of the proposed work will integrate the fields of biomaterials, chemistry, immunology, and virology for the development of biomaterials-based immunization platforms against not only WNV, but also other emerging flaviviruses of public health importance."
"9487122","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         The impact of overweight/obesity on Veterans' health and VA healthcare costs is staggering and a better understanding of the mechanisms by which overweight/obesity lead to metabolic dysfunction, as well as the mechanisms by which exercise improves this dysfunction, is required to effectively treat these comorbidities. In addition to the storage of energy, adipose tissue contributes to metabolic homeostasis by buffering plasma free fatty acids, limiting ectopic lipid accumulation and secreting adipokines. Appropriate adipose tissue blood flow is required for normal adipose function and is influenced by its resistance artery vasoreactivity and vascular density. Thus, arterial dysfunction characterized by a loss of nitric oxide (NO) may contribute to metabolic dysfunction by impairing adipose artery endothelium dependent dilation (EDD) and angiogenesis, limiting both blood flow and the entopic storage of lipids in white adipose depots. Recently, the pro-angiogenic effects of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) were shown to be inhibited by the actions of roundabout4 (Robo4) and the downstream GTPase, ARF6. Here, we will determine if altered endothelial Robo4/ARF6 activity underlies adipose artery dysfunction and subsequent metabolic dysfunction with high fat feeding. In contrast to obesity, chronic exercise has beneficial effects on metabolism that may be mediated by adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK). With exercise, increased AMPK activity leads to activation of energy conserving pathways in metabolically active tissues; whereas, in endothelial cells, AMPK activity leads to NO production that occurs downstream of VEGF. However, it is not known what role AMPK activation may play in improving adipose tissue function, if endothelial Robo4/ARF6 signaling modulates the activity of AMPK or if pharmacological activation of AMPK can serve as an exercise mimetic and improve adipose tissue function in the face of obesity."
"9486843","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):           Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PC) is the most common malignant disease in the human pancreas. It is a highly lethal disease and the fourth leading cause of cancer deaths in the US. Fewer than 5% of people with PC live no longer than five years. One of the main reasons it has such a poor prognosis is that the majority of patients already have metastasis at the time of diagnosis, and metastasis makes PC insensitive to many chemotherapeutic drugs including gemcitabine (GEM). Thus, new ways to combat this disease are urgently needed. We discovered that Cyr61/CCN1, an extracellular protein, is overexpressed in PC cells and specimens, and its expression is correlated with disease progression and drug resistance. Moreover, Cyr61 activates sonic hedgehog (SHh) signaling, connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), mutants K-Ras and its activator MAZ/SAF-1-transcription factor in PC cells and stromal cells, all of which contribute to the development of PC as well as drug resistance. Based on these exciting preliminary findings, we now propose to use genetically engineered cell lines, genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs) along with state-of- the-art technology to unravel if blocking Cyr61 could inhibit PC growth and drug sensitization via blocking desmoplastic reaction in PC.  We propose three aims to test the hypothesis. In Aim 1, we will explore the role of Cyr61 in K-Rasmut mediated PC development and progression using GEMMs and orthotopic transplants of genetically engineered PC cell lines. In Aim 2, we will examine whether Cyr61 signaling is crucial to maintain stemness and tumorigenic activity of PC-initiating cells (PICs)/stem cells (PSCs) and dissect the down-stream signaling pathway of Cyr61 required to perform these events. Lastly, in Aim 3 we will determine the role of Cyr61 in growth of fibrous tissue (desmoplasia) during PC growth in GEMMs and orthotopic models. To test the aims, we have already standardized the use of an orthotopic human pancreatic cancer xenograft in a SCID mouse model using ultrasound guided injection of PC cells into the pancreas and high resolution imaging techniques. These techniques have already revealed many steps of the progression of this deadly disease, and they will be used along with the unique expertise of our multi-disciplinary collaborative team to explore the role of Cyr61 in pancreatic carcinogenesis.  Collectively, these findings will provide knowledge of the essential functions of Cyr61, not only in development of PC, but also the critical role in tumor-stromal interactions for the development of desmoplastic reaction. This knowledge will allow dissection of the molecular mechanisms behind these vital events. Moreover, these studies will directly indicate that disruption of Cyr61-signaling would be a new therapeutic strategy against PC."
"9491659","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Malignant phenotypes are driven by a group of coordinated proteins and targeting a cluster of functionally interdependent molecules should be more effective for therapeutic intervention. This is especially true for Ras- dependent cancers, as the Ras oncoprotein is non-druggable and targeting its interaction with key partner proteins may be essential for therapeutic development. K-Ras is mutated in up to 50% of colon cancers, and has been implicated in malignant development and progression. There is thus an urgent need to develop targeted therapies for K-Ras mutated (MT-K-Ras) colon cancer. This proposal will test the hypothesis that a p38g-activated ternary complex with MT-K-Ras and heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) is a novel therapeutic target for K-Ras dependent colon cancer. This hypothesis is supported by our preliminary studies showing that p38g mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), an established Ras effector, binds Hsp90, a chaperone, and MT-K-Ras, but not wild-type (WT) K-Ras, in colon cancer cells. Moreover, p38g phosphorylates Hsp90, and pharmacological inhibitors of p38g or Hsp90 disrupt the ternary complex, decrease MT-K-Ras levels of protein expression, and selectively inhibit K-Ras dependent growth in vitro and/or in vivo. Together, these results indicate that the p38g activated ternary complex with Hsp90 and MT-K-Ras is a potential therapeutic target for K-Ras dependent colon cancer. The following specific aims will test this hypothesis: 1) To demonstrate that p38g and Hsp90 form a ternary protein complex that protects MT-K-Ras from proteasome- dependent degradation; 2) To demonstrate if p38g activates Hsp90 by inducing its phosphorylation at S595 and whether this event is central to the formation of the MT-K-Ras/p38g/Hsp90 complex; and 3) To demonstrate the therapeutic potential and clinical significance of the p38g/Hsp90/K-Ras complex in colon cancer. These studies will demonstrate that the p38g-activated ternary-complex is a novel therapeutic target for MT-K-Ras colon cancer. Disruption of this complex with pharmacological inhibitors of p38g and Hsp90 is a highly promising therapeutic strategy for the treatment of K-Ras dependent colon cancer. Since colon cancer is the second leading cause of cancer-related death in the United States, discovery of novel targeted therapeutics for K-Ras dependent colon cancer will directly contribute to veteran's health care."
"9487900","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         More than 1,500,000 individuals in the US are diagnosed with cancer every year. Cachexia (defined as an involuntary weight loss due to adipose tissue and skeletal muscle loss), and anorexia (decreased food intake) are present in up to 80% of these patients, contributing to the decrease in functional performance, quality of life and survival seen in this setting; however, treatments for this condition are lacking. Ghrelin is a novel anabolic hormone that increases energy intake and decreases energy expenditure and inflammation leading to an increase in muscle and fat mass; although, its mechanisms of action in the setting of cancer cachexia are not fully understood. To this date, the only identify receptor for ghrelin is the growth hormone secretagogue receptor 1a (GHSR-1a) and this receptor is not present in muscle or adipose tissue. Recent data has shown that some of ghrelin's effects are GHSR-1a-independent. The objectives of this proposal are to characterize the mechanisms of action of ghrelin and GHSR-1a agonists in muscle and adipose tissue and to establish the extent to which these mechanisms are GHSR-1a-dependent in cancer cachexia. We hypothesize that ghrelin ameliorates cancer cachexia by inducing: 1) GHSR-1a- dependent increases in appetite, GH/IGF-I and downregulation of inflammation, and 2) GHSR-1a-independent decreases in proteolysis by acting directly on muscle cells. We also hypothesize that ghrelin increases lipogenesis and downregulates lipid oxidation and lipolysis in tumor-induced cachexia through GHSR-1a- dependent and independent mechanisms. Our specific aims are: 1) To determine the role of the ghrelin receptor GHSR-1a in mediating the effects of ghrelin in tumor-induced cachexia in rodent muscle. Using our already established in-vivo model (Lewis Lung Carcinoma [LLC]-induced cachexia) in GHSR-1a WT and KO mice, we will determine the role of GHSR-1a activation in modulating muscle mass and strength, inflammation, proteolysis and protein synthesis in this setting. 2) To characterize GHSR-1a-independent mechanisms of action of ghrelin in muscle. Based on our preliminary data showing that the GHSR-1a is not necessary for ghrelin to prevent cisplatin-induced proteolysis in C2C12 cells, and that ghrelin partially prevent LLC-induced cachexia in GHSR-1a KO, we will study these effects in- vivo in our LLC-induced cachexia model and in-vitro in C2C12 cells and 1ry myocyte culture from GHSR-1a KO mice. We will characterize the pathways mediating these GHSR-1a-independent effects of ghrelin and perform experiments to identify the alternate receptor responsible for these effects. 3) To establish the role of GHSR-1a in mediating the effects of ghrelin in adipose tissue. As shown in our cisplatin model, we will study the role of ghrelin in preventing fat atrophy induced by LLC tumor and the relative contribution of lipogenesis, lipolysis and lipid oxidation in this setting. Using our GHSR-1a WT and KO animals we will also establish the role of GHSR-1a in mediating ghrelin's effect in fat in-vivo and in-vitro. The development of therapies for the prevention or treatment of cancer-related fat and muscle wasting is desperately needed because they significantly reduce quality of life in Veterans with cancer. The present proposal will provide insight into ghrelin's mechanisms of action, determine which of these effects are GHSR- 1a-dependent and which are GHSR-1a-independent, characterize these two pathways and identify this novel receptor. Taken together, these experiments will determine the mechanisms mediating ghrelin's protective effects in this setting, addressing a clinical need and filling a void in the literature. Ultimately, these results will allow for better targeting of this pathway and the development of novel therapies for this condition. Other conditions such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, heart failure and frailty of the elderly are also associated with muscle and fat loss and will benefit from the advance in knowledge that this proposal will bring."
"9593433","SUMMARY The innate immune system is the front line of host defense against microbial infections, but its rapid and uncontrolled activation elicits microbicidal mechanisms that have deleterious effects. Increasing evidence indicates that the metazoan nervous system, which responds to stimuli originating from both the internal and the external environment, functions as a modulatory apparatus that controls not only microbial killing pathways but also cellular homeostatic mechanisms. However, given the complexity of the nervous and immune systems of mammals, the precise mechanisms by which the two systems influence one another remain understudied. This proposal describes experiments designed to elucidate the mechanism by which the nervous system may sense pathogens and/or probiotic microbe-associated molecular patterns (MAMPs) and control innate immunity. Using the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, we have recently demonstrated that G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling in at least 9 different neurons controls immune responses, indicating that cell non- autonomous signals from different neurons may act on non-neural tissues to regulate innate immune responses at the organismal level. GPCR signaling in the aforementioned neurons controls microbial killing pathways and a conserved unfolded protein response pathway that may be necessary to alleviate the increased demand on protein folding during immune activation. In this proposal, we will use a variety of molecular and genetic techniques to explore the general hypothesis that the nervous system regulates immune homeostasis during the host response to pathogen infections at the whole animal level."
"9378702","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):          Mechanical forces and, in particular, fluid shear stress (FSS), play critical roles in endothelia t regulate vascular reactivity and in renal epithelia to affect transepithelial cation transport that collectively, determine blood pressue (BP). Mechano-regulation of tubular cation transport is an important regulator of renal sodium (Na) homeostasis and infers the existence of mechano-sensors in renal epithelia. Cholesterol (chol)-rich lipid rafts (LRs), signaling platforms located n the plasma membrane (PM), are mechano-sensors that induce paracrine-mediated vasodilation (ie nitric oxide synthesis) in endothelia; however, little is known about their sensory function in  renal epithelia. Chol maintains the integrity of LRs, and effects on LR chol content impacts FSS-mediated signaling. The FSS-sensitive signaling pathways which regulate mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) and intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) in cells (1) are localized to caveolin-1 (cav-1) and flotillin-2 (flot-2), respectively, expressing LRs in collecting duct (CD) cells, and (2) control changes in COX-2 expression and PGE2 release, respectively. Additionally, chol integration into E-prostanoid (EP) receptor expressing LRs can alter signaling that regulates transepithelial Na absorption. In PRELIMINARY STUDIES an anti-diuretic, hypertensive phenotype was uncovered in chol fed mice, volume expanded by parenteral saline, that was associated with suppressed flow-mediated COX-2 activity and PGE2 release in microdissected cortical CDs (CCDs). Thus, the final integrated epithelial response to tubular flow rate is determined by chol calibrated, FSS-mediated PGE2 release and EP receptor stimulation which regulate Na transport. We hypothesize that hypercholesterolemia alters the chol content in LRs of the renal CD to regulate flow/FSS-induced COX-2 expression and PGE2 release which, via autocrine/paracrine EP- receptor based signaling, influences Na transport in the distal nephron. This hypothesis will be tested in the following specific aims (SAs): SA1. Test whether chol-rich LRs are mechanosensory platforms for FSS-mediated stimulation of polycystin-2 (PC-2) and MAPK activation. SA1.a Evaluate the localization of PC-2, a mechano-sensitive channel responsible for apical entry of Ca2+ into CD cells, and MAPK (p38, ERK) within specific populations of LRs in CD cells and microdissected CCDs. SA1.b Determine whether FSS leads to translocation of PC-2 and MAPK out of their respective chol-rich LRs to allow for maximal PC-2 activation and MAPK phosphorylation. SA1.c Test whether LR chol content affects resting localization and FSS-induced translocation of PC-2 and MAPK out of LRs. SA2. Test whether short-term chol ingestion leads to incorporation of chol into the CCD that alters flow-mediated COX stimulation, PGE2 release and Na excretion. SA2.a Evaluate whether dietary chol consumption incorporates into the renal CCD SA2.b Determine whether chol integration into renal CCDs modifies net PGE2 generating capacity, flow- mediated PGE2 release, Na excretion and, in turn, BP. SA3. Test whether short-term chol ingestion inhibits flow-mediated PGE2 release and alters EP receptor dependent signaling, to enhance transepithelial Na transport in microperfused CCDs SA3.a Evaluate whether chol incorporation in CCDs suppresses flow-mediated PGE2 release to augment Na absorption. SA3.b Test whether chol incorporation in CCDs modifies EP receptor signaling to enhance Na absorption."

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long term objective of the Alcohol Education program (ADEP) for Social Work Faculty is to promote the use of empirically-supported alcohol and other drugs (AOD) identification and treatment methods among social workers which is consistent with the NIAAA goal to promote the use of research to treat and prevent AOD abuse and dependence. A major component of ADEP is the Social Work (SW) Immersion Faculty Training (SWIFT) program which will train100 SW faculty, all from accredited SW schools (208), to educate SW graduate students about empirically-supported AOD identification and treatment methods and to integrate these topics into their school's curriculum. The Aims of this program are: 1. Implementation of SWIFT will increase: (1a) participants' (SW faculty) own knowledge of empirically-supported AOD identification and treatment methods and self-efficacy in teaching about these issues; (1b) participants' (SW faculty) inclusion of current and accurate content and materials on empirically-supported AOD identification and treatment methods in their courses and in the curricula of their schools; and, (1c) Master's level graduate students' knowledge and skills of empirically-supported AOD identification and treatment methods among students enrolled in the courses of SW faculty who attended the SWIFT program and developed new curriculum content. The ADEP program is an adaptation of an NIDA-funded training model used at the Boston University (BU) School of Medicine (MED) to train Chief Residents to disseminate AOD knowledge and skills to physicians nationwide. This effort has been ongoing for 10 years, has been evaluated and shown to be effective (Alford et al., 2009). A second component of ADEP is that it uses and improves on the mixed- methods outcome evaluation design from the BU-MED program.

Guiding all aspects of the program will be AOD Expert Teaching Faculty and an interdisciplinary Advisory Committee with experience in implementing NIAAA and NIDA R25 programs; directing evaluations and disseminating findings from AOD educational programs; developing AOD curricula; collaborating with the PIs on prior AOD education, evaluation and research efforts; and disseminating research findings and teaching SW clinical practice."
"9378388","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):          Tauopathies are a group of neurodegenerative diseases that are characterized pathologically by neuronal loss and the accumulation of aggregates of the microtubule-associated protein Tau in surviving CNS neurons. Collectively, these disease, which include progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), frontotemporal dementia (FTD), chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) and Alzheimer's disease (AD), are a common and important cause of progressive neurological disability in Veterans. Current treatments only partially mitigate symptoms and do not alter the course of these diseases; consequently, there is an urgent need for new approaches that address pathogenic mechanisms and prevent disease progression. Convergent genetic and pathological evidence strongly suggests that Tau is centrally involved in causing neurodegeneration in these diseases, and there is accumulating evidence that oligomeric Tau species are a key pathogenic mediator. In addition, human tauopathy tissue and experimental Tau models both show striking evidence of impaired mitochondrial function resulting in reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and oxidative damage to neurons. However, there is no consensus regarding the mechanisms by which Tau and mitochondria interact and it is not known whether changes in mitochondrial function are a proximate pathogenic event that could be targeted therapeutically. Building on: (i) our recent finding that cytoplasmic protein oligomers  inhibit mitochondrial protein import by interacting with the translocase of the outer mitochondrial  membrane (TOMM) complex; (ii) published evidence showing that oligomeric Tau species are neurotoxic and impair expression of mitochondrial proteins; and (iii) our preliminary data showing that Tau interacts with the TOMM complex in Alzheimer's disease tissue, our overall guiding hypothesis is that: inhibition of mitochondrial protein import by oligomeric Tau causes progressive mitochondrial functional deficits that provoke oxidative damage and neuronal death. To address this hypothesis directly in vivo, we have generated novel zebrafish tauopathy models with progressive and highly reproducible phenotypes, allowing establishment of the sequence of biochemical events underlying pathogenesis over a practicable experimental time course. This model has been constructed on a genetic background that lacks pigment, allowing imaging of CNS neurons in vivo by confocal microscopy. Coupled with novel transgenic zebrafish lines expressing ratiometric reporters of cellular mitochondrial function, we will determine how neuronal mitochondrial bioenergetic functions, ROS production, and cellular RedOx status change during progressive tauopathy the CNS in vivo, and whether abnormal phenotypes can be rescued by over-expression of the translocase complex protein TOM20 (Aim 1). These experiments will test the hypothesis that protein import-dependent abnormalities of mitochondrial function in neurons precede the onset of neurological phenotypes in tauopathy and worsen with disease progression, causing oxidative damage and cell death. Next, in a series of complementary experiments in vitro and in vivo, we will test whether oligomeric Tau competes with nuclear-encoded mitochondrial proteins for interaction with TOM20 to directly inhibit mitochondrial protein import (Aim 2). Finally, exploiting the translational potential of Ta transgenic zebrafish, we will carry out the first phenotype-based drug re-purposing screen in a vertebrate tauopathy model (Aim 3). Using novel, automated neurological phenotyping assays we will interrogate a chemical library against functional endpoints that are caused by tauopathy, but which are unbiased to preconceptions regarding molecular mechanisms of pathogenesis. Compounds that are identified as modulators of tauopathy in vivo in this pilot screen will be tested for activity in restoring mitochondrial protein import and function, and will be candidates for further therapeutic development. Together, these studies will elucidate mitochondrial mechanisms underlying degeneration of CNS neurons in tauopathy in vivo and will provide new avenues of investigation for the development of effective therapeutics."
"9505843","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         The newly described collagen fragment proline-glycine-proline (PGP) drives chronic neutrophilic inflammatory responses and appears to play a role in COPD pathogenesis. Prolyl endopeptidase (PE) is a particularly important serine protease because it has been shown to catalyze the final step in a proteolytic cascade required to generate PGP from collagen. Consequently, PE would seem to represent a very attractive new target for future therapeutics related to COPD. However because recognition of the role of PE in chronic inflammation is so new, certain fundamental aspects of the regulation of this protease in the context of lung disease remains poorly understood. This revised proposal will fill in this void of knowledge by highlighting new evidence from the PI's laboratory demonstrating that PE is released from airway epithelial cells via exosomes. This application focuses on a unique feed-forward pathway of PE expression and PGP generation in cigarette smoke (CS) exposure and COPD with particular emphasis on endogenous CXCR ligand signaling. The aims in this proposal are thematically linked to each other (through high quality in vitro, in vivo models and ex vivo clinicl specimens) and are carefully crafted to improve our understanding of this pathway and its relevance to COPD lung disease. Specific aim 1a will examine the regulation and release of PE from primary airway epithelial cells by CXC ligands, highlighting the potential of PE release via exosomes, identifying the intracellular pathways involved in the release, and determining the impact of this release on ex vivo PGP generation from collagen. Specific aim 1b will determine the impact of cigarette smoke (CS) on the regulation of PE and PGP production, with specific targeting of CXC receptors and PE with novel therapeutic compounds. The second aim of this grant will focus on PE inhibition as a therapeutic approach in a chronic CS model of COPD. This will be examined utilizing a genetic deletion of PE (the PREP-/- mouse) to examine if there is amelioration of the observed inflammatory response and phenotype with chronic CS exposure. This model will also be examined in testing a new PE inhibitor S- 17092, currently in clinical trials for neurodegenerative disease, as a lead anti-inflammatory therapeutic in this model of COPD lung disease. The final aim will involve the collection of clinical biospecimens via bronchoscopy from patients with COPD to determine the presence of PE-rich exosomes and PGP peptides compared to individuals without lung disease. The successful completion of these aims will lead to an increased understanding of the regulation and release of PE in the extracellular environment and the downstream effects of its unfettered protease activity. In doing so, these studies may result in the development of a new biomarker and therapeutic target for COPD."
"9378717","Colorectal cancer (CRC) remains the second most common cause of cancer mortality worldwide, and among Veterans in the United States, the third despite the successful implementation of successful preventive screening measures. One contributing factor that has newly emerged is the rapid development of cancers in small, sessile adenomas (polyps), with mutational processes and signatures that drive early CRC tumorigenesis. Yet, to date, biomarkers and risk factors for polyps (adenomas) that inordinately and rapidly develop into colon cancer remain poorly defined. We recently observed surprisingly high mutational profiles through whole-genome sequence (WGS) analysis in 2 of 4 pairs of benign colorectal adenoma tissue samples. Extending this to unsupervised hierarchical clustered transcriptomic analysis of a further 7 pairs of adenomas reveals distinct mutational signatures regardless of adenoma size. Strikingly, we observe mutations in the TGF-? pathway and CEA-associated genes in 4 out of 11 adenomas, overlapping with the Wnt pathway. Immunohistochemical labeling reveals a nearly 5-fold increase in CEA levels in 23% of adenoma samples tested, with a concomitant loss of TGF-? signaling. We have defined a functional role by which the CEA B3 domain interacts with TGFBR1, potentially inactivating the tumor suppressor function of TGF-? signaling. Raised CEA levels occur with concomitant loss of TGF-? signaling and activation of oncogenic molecules that include STAT3. Furthermore, deletion of Smad3/4 adaptor ?2SP results in loss of TGF-? signaling, with a spontaneous formation of adenomas as well as overt CRC, and presents a strong mouse model of CRC. The overall hypothesis of this application is that disruption of the TGF-? tumor suppressor pathway, and concomitantly raised levels of oncogenic molecules such as CEA, STAT3, disrupt normal colonic mucosa and promote oncogenesis in CRC. Our aims are to: AIM 1a) Expand and validate the significance of loss of the TGF-? pathway associated with high CEA and/or CEACAM6 levels as prognostic factors in advanced adenomas that rapidly progress to CRC through i) First, whole transcriptomic sequence, immunohistochemical and RT-PCR analyses of 40 additional adenomas ii) Secondly, by examining The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) Pan gastrointestinal cancer (GI) datasets to obtain a complete evaluation of our findings. 1b) Determine whether CEA/CEACAM6 and STAT3 with loss of TGF-? signaling are drivers of early CRC in vivo. 2 a) Determine the molecular mechanisms by which CEA inhibits the TGF-? tumor suppressor pathway in early and advanced CRC. We plan to accomplish this through i) Analyzing the role of CEA and CEACAM6 in the disruption of the TGF-? pathway and concomitant IL-6/STAT3 activation in CRC. ii) Determine antitumor activity of CEA inhibition, with and without STAT3 inhibitors and characterize their mechanisms of action. Through translational studies- interrogating human cell lines/genomics, and animal model systems of colon cancer, this application proposes an integrated approach for human CRC, providing novel insights into early and advanced CRC. With vaccines available, as well as new low toxicity therapeutics, identifying specific populations particularly among Veterans with multiple co-morbidities, that could respond to treatment, these goals are centrally important for improving the quality of life under treatment, as well as the mortality from this common cancer."
"9396977","Project Summary  Cocaine use disorder is a chronic disease that takes a huge toll on society, and there is currently a lack of understanding of the cellular and circuit adaptations that take place in response to contingent drug use. While studies have examined excitatory signaling, there has been less focus on inhibitory neurotransmission in brain regions that play a central role in addictive behaviors. Elucidation of drug- induced adaptations to inhibitory neural circuits could provide a means to prevent and treat addiction. Chronic cocaine increases dopamine transporter (DAT) function and preliminary data suggests altered D2 autoreceptor inhibition, thus affecting the efficacy of the neurotransmitter dopamine (DA). However, midbrain DA neurons project to anatomically distinct brain regions that serve diverse functions. It is unclear how differentially projecting DA neurons diverge in their mechanisms of inhibitory neurotransmission or how these pathways may be altered following cocaine self-administration.  Dopamine neurons communicate with each other through D2 autoreceptor-mediated inhibitory synaptic currents (D2-IPSCs). D2 autoreceptors activate G-protein gated inward rectifying potassium (GIRK) channels, an inhibitory signal, which plays a key role in regulating the pattern and rate of DA neuron firing. Our group has established that signaling at dendrodentritic DA synapses undergoes long-term depression (LTDDA), a unique form of plasticity. The effects of cocaine self-administration on D2-IPSCs are not known, or whether cocaine can induce DA plasticity in a projection-specific manner.  To address these questions we will examine DA autoreceptor signaling and the effects of cocaine self- administration in mouse brain slices. We will examine DA neurons in the ventral tegmental area and substantia nigra that project to distinct areas: the nucleus accumbens (meso-accumbal), the amygdala (meso-amygdaloid) and the dorsal striatum (nigrostriatal). Our central hypothesis is that that DA neurons projecting to discrete areas will exhibit distinct functional markers of inhibitory neurotransmission (D2, GIRK, LTDDA) and that cocaine self-administration will attenuate inhibitory input to the meso-accumbal pathway to the greatest extent as a result of changes in D2 and GIRK availability as well as DAT functionality.  No study to date has investigated cocaine-induced plasticity of dopamine autoreceptor-mediated inhibition in a projection-specific manner, making this study innovative. These experiments will contribute significant data that further elucidates mechanisms responsible for alterations in D2 inhibitory neurotransmission in different circuits in response to cocaine self-administration. This research can have great impact by providing a framework for discovery of targeted therapeutic agents to treat drug abuse. Finally, the proposed aims will provide excellent opportunities to expand my training such that I will successfully reach my goal to become an exceptional independent investigator in the field of drug abuse."

"9486824","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):           Background: Lung cancer is the number one cause of cancer death in men and women in the United States and remains an identified medical priority for the Department of Veterans Affairs due to the high rates of tobacco addiction acquired by military personnel. Recent data shows an actual increase in smoking rates among active military personnel and smoking rates among Veterans are consistently at least 10% higher than the general population (29% vs. 18%). The five-year survival rate for lung cancer remains 16%, a rate which has shown limited improvement over the last several decades. Among Veterans, only 16% of lung cancer is currently diagnosed at a curable stage. Large-scale screening trials (most notably the National Lung Screening trial - NLST) have been completed, and low dose CT scans were proven to significantly decrease lung cancer mortality (20%) when compared to chest x-ray. CT screening for lung cancer has been endorsed by many groups and a VA implementation study is being conducted. If CT screening is widely adopted in high risk groups (as defined by the NLST), there should be an increase in patients presenting with curable disease (stages I and II), leading to improved overall survival. Improved survival will result in a growing population of patients at ris for second primary lung cancers. The risk of developing a second primary lung cancer after curative treatment ranges from 3-6%. Former smokers are also at high risk of lung cancer, with greater than 50% of lung cancers in the US diagnosed in this group. The potential clinical impact of chemopreventive agents in this large, high-risk population emphasizes the need for continued studies. Improved success in decreasing lung cancer rates will rely not only on smoking prevention and cessation, but also on effective chemopreventive strategies. Work Accomplished: Prostacyclin (prostaglandin I2, PGI2) is a naturally occurring eicosanoid that possesses anti-inflammatory and anti-metastatic properties, as well as a suppressive role in tumor growth. We have found that the balance of these eicosanoids is pivotal in lung tumorigenesis and key mechanistic studies completed during the last grant cycle have shown that the observed chemoprevention may directly result from PGI2 and PGI2 analogues engaging the transcription activator PPAR¿ (peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma). These findings, coupled with clinical studies observing a 33% reduction in lung cancer rates among Veterans taking PPAR¿ agonists for diabetes mellitus, suggest PPAR¿ agonists may prevent lung cancer. My VA funded laboratory has focused on evaluating PGI2 as a chemopreventive agent, and animals with increased levels of PGI2 or receiving PPAR¿ agonists are protected from developing lung cancer. Most importantly, this led to a phase II clinical trial which showed oral iloprost improved endobronchial damage in former smokers. Our current human trial is evaluating pioglitazone is high risk current and former smokers. Proposed Research: This grant proposes to advance pre-clinical studies of PPAR¿ agonists in a squamous cell lung cancer model with a focus on the effects of PPAR¿ agonists on the tumor microenvironment (TME) and macrophage programming. We hypothesize that PPAR¿ activators (endogenous PGI2 and pioglitazone) will chemoprevent the development of endobronchial dysplasia and lung tumors, and will alter the TME by affecting inflammatory cell recruitment and phenotype. The following hypotheses will be tested: Hypothesis 1: PPAR¿ agonists promote anti-tumor effects by influencing the production of pro- and anti- growth factors by tumor associated macrophages. Hypothesis 2: Selective PPAR¿ agonists (endogenous prostacyclin and pioglitazone) chemoprevent the development of murine squamous cell lung cancer and pre-malignant endobronchial dysplasia by altering inflammatory cell populations and macrophage phenotype."
"9487137","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         PTSD is a disabling condition consequent to trauma exposure. Recent evidence demonstrates PTSD secondary to combat exposure prospectively increases risk of early incident cardiovascular disease (CVD), with a meta-analyses we have recently completed revealing that PTSD is associated with a hazard ratio of 1.34 for incident CHD or CHD-specific mortality. The rate of PTSD among Veterans who have served during Operations Iraqi Freedom, Enduring Freedom, and New Dawn (OIF/OEF/OND) is more than double that seen in the non-veteran population and consistent with that previously seen among Vietnam era veterans. It is essential for purposes of risk stratification, risk reduction, and health services planning that we establisha more complete understanding of the illness burden associated with military service, and develop PTSD associated risk markers that predict early onset of CVD. Endothelial dysfunction is the earliest indicator of risk for incident CVD. In a pilot series with 23 OIF/OEF/OND veterans we have found that, compared to individuals without any symptoms of PTSD, those diagnosed with PTSD secondary to military service demonstrate significant impairment in endothelial function and that even those with sub-syndromal PTSD symptoms demonstrate impairment relative to those without symptoms. The Specific Aim of this proposed study is therefore to examine endothelial (dys) function as a promising mechanistic link between PTSD and risk for incident CVD. OIF/OEF veterans with a range of PTSD symptom severity (N=300) will complete our laboratory protocol that includes assessment of the endothelial response during standard hyperemic probe and during emotional stress, administered under controlled conditions, with the majority (N=230) repeating this protocol approximately 1 year late. Assessment of autonomic and HPA axis activity, and of contributors to vascular homeostasis (e.g., endothelin-1) will be accomplished during the protocol. We hypothesize that: 1) a diagnosis of PTSD will be associated with endothelial dysfunction; we will explore (1a) whether there is a dose response relationship such that, as severity of PTSD symptoms increase we observe greater endothelial dysfunction.; 2) A change in PTSD symptom severity from time 1 to time 2, will be associated with a concomitant change in the endothelial response to both hyperemic and emotional challenge. We will also explore the association of endothelial (dys) function during emotional stress with markers of sympathetic, parasympathetic, and HPA axis activity and with associated contributors to vascular homeostasis."
"9487893","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Our microbiome influences how our immune system functions. Our microbiome has changed as a result of living in highly hygienic industrialized countries. A major change in our microbiome is loss of exposure to helminths (parasitic worms). Prior to the 1940's, helminth colonization was nearly universal and there is strong evidence that this exposure helped to shape our genome. Loss of these previously ubiquitous members of our paleobiome, can have far ranging immunologic effect. Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) currently afflicts more than one million Americans and many thousands of veterans. The incidence of IBD and other immune-mediated diseases increased dramatically after the 1940's in North America and Europe. These diseases are rare in less developed tropical countries. Veterans that served in Vietnam or were prisoners of war are at lower risk of developing IBD than are other veterans. Moreover, as countries develop economically the incidence of IBD and other immune-mediated diseases increase. Thus, IBD is a globally emerging disorder. Although specific genes predispose to IBD, there is strong evidence that a change in environment concurrent with socioeconomic improvement confers risk for developing the disorder. We propose that a change from our historic paleobiome, the lack of helminth exposure, in developed countries is an important risk factor for developing IBD and other immune-mediated diseases. We and others have shown that colonization with helminths protects mice from immune-mediated colitis, encephalitis, diabetes, and airway disease. These are models of diseases that have emerged within highly industrialized countries. Understanding how helminth exposure decreases immune mediated diseases will guide development of targeted therapy to prevent or treat those diseases. Th17 cells control pro-inflammatory pathological responses, like that of IBD. Recently it has become clear that Th17 cells are heterogeneous. In addition to making IL17, highly pro-inflammatory Th17 cells make IFNy (Th17/Th1). Other Th17 cells with a regulatory phenotype express FoxP3 or make IL10 (Th17/Treg). Immune mediated disease likely results from dysregulated Th17 plasticity. We discovered that mucosal IL17 production is inhibited by exposure to helminths and that this exposure decreases Th17/Th1 and increases Th17/Treg percentages in lamina propria and mesenteric lymph node cell populations. Our hypothesis is that helminth exposure protects against colitis by altering Th17 heterogeneity/plasticity. This project will test this hypothesis wth 3 specific aims. Our first aim will explore the mechanisms enabled by helminth exposure that inhibit Th17/Th1 plasticity with focus on Stat6 signaling. Our second aim will explore the mechanisms enabled by helminth exposure that augment Th17/Treg plasticity. Our third aim will explore how changes in Th circuitry alters intestinal epithelial cell function with focus on epithelial cell pSTAT3 expression. Our research is unique in that we are exploring possible root causes for the emergence of autoimmune and immune-mediated inflammatory disease in modern civilizations. In addition, these studies will provide insight into how helminth-exposed individuals that live or served in less developed countries may respond to immunologic challenges. Furthermore, we are examining in vivo how infectious organisms alter immune pathways to influence chronic inflammatory diseases like those that afflict veterans."
"9565844","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Limiting inflammation could significantly impact the course of chronic pancreatitis (CP). To date, there is no standard therapy available to dampen or reverse the inflammatory response associated with CP. Much of the inflammation in CP is driven by elevated interleukin-6 (IL-6) and other cytokines. These soluble factors transmit signals via common intracellular pathways. Most notable are activation of the Jak-STAT pathway. IL-6 also regulates differentiation of macrophages and T cells that fuel inflammation and fibrosis in CP. Thus targeted inhibition of IL-6/Jak-STAT signaling may modulate immune and inflammatory factors in CP and provide therapeutic benefit. Recent published studies from our group and others have demonstrated that pancreatic stellate cells (PSC) are instrumental in driving inflammation in the pancreas. In fact, our data indicate that PSC isolated from mouse models and patients with either pancreatic cancer or CP display striking production of IL-6, and dependence on Jak-STAT signaling for survival. Moreover, inhibition of Jak-STAT signaling decreased proliferation and activation of these sentinel inflammatory cells. These data identify a novel role for the stromal cells as mediators of local and systemic inflammatory changes in pancreatic disorders, and suggest the IL-6/Jak-STAT axis plays a major role in their biologic properties. We hypothesize that IL-6/Jak- STAT signaling in pancreatic stellate cells represents a targetable node relevant to the pathogenesis of chronic pancreatitis. In Aim 1, we will determine the role of stromal IL-6-mediated signaling in pancreatitis using novel knockout mouse models. Mice with conditional deletion of IL-6 in the stroma will be generated using a fibroblast specific promoter. CP will be induced via a traditional approach of repeated injections of caerulein, or via a novel surgical approach involving ligation of the mid-pancreatic duct, followed by a single caerulein injection. The impact of stromal IL-6 loss on biomarkers of CP will be evaluated. These studies will define the mechanism by which IL-6-mediated signaling, specifically in the PSC compartment, is relevant to the pathology of CP. In Aim 2, we will evaluate the impact of targeting IL-6/Jak-STAT signaling in murine models of CP. The efficacy of IL-6 neutralizing Ab and the small molecule Jak inhibitor, Ruxolitinib will be evaluated in the caerulein and surgical models of CP. Immune biomarkers altered by inhibition of IL-6/Jak-STAT signaling, and their relevance to pancreatitis will be defined in tissues from these animals. This project is innovative as to date, IL-6 blockade or Jak inhibitors have not been systematically evaluated in patients with CP and only limited studies focused on acinar cells have been published. This approach has strong potential to modulate key downstream pathways that regulate inflammation and disease severity. Thus, there is a high likelihood for rapid translation of already available anti-IL-6 Ab or Jak inhibitors to patients with CP. This project will have hig impact as we will gain necessary pre-clinical data on IL-6/Jak-STAT inhibition in CP that could be leveraged for human clinical trials and subsequent investigations of this pathway within pancreatic disease."
"9548376","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Methamphetamine (METH) addiction currently presents an enormous public health issue, and yet no therapeutic agent is currently approved for its treatment. Psychostimulant addiction is a chronic, progressive disease driven by numerous persistent neurophysiological adaptations. METH self-administration increases input of the neuropeptide neurotensin onto dopamine (DA) neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA), which are extensively implicated in drug reward processes. While literature evidence and our preliminary results suggest that neurotensin decreases DA autoreceptor-mediated signaling, the role of DA D2 autoreceptors in drug self-administration has not been described. We have recently identified what had been a missing tool in the study of DA autoreceptors and DA-mediated synaptic transmission: an inhibitory postsynaptic current (or IPSC) mediated directly by dendrodendritic DA neurotransmission in the VTA. The identification of the DA IPSC allows us, for the first time, to directly address synaptic questions concerning the relationship between METH abuse and DA neurotransmission. The goal of this application is to determine key synaptic adaptations at the level of the DA cell body that are responsible for escalating METH self-administration. Our central hypothesis is that METH use decreases D2 autoreceptor signaling in VTA DA neurons through a neurotensin-dependent rise in intracellular calcium, producing an escalation of METH self-administration behavior. We will test this by combining patch clamp electrophysiology in brain slices with intravenous METH self-administration and VTA site-specific drug microinjections in mice.  The studies in Aim 1 will determine the mechanisms responsible for long-term depression of the DA IPSC. The hypothesis to be tested is that that long term depression of DA IPSCs is produced by a neurotensin receptor-dependent rise in intracellular calcium producing the activation of protein phosphatase 3. The studies in Aim 2 will determine the changes in the DA IPSC produced by METH self-administration. The hypothesis to be tested is that in vivo contingent METH self-administration decreases autoreceptor signaling through a neurotensin-dependent mechanism. The studies in Aim 3 will determine the role of DA autoreceptor-mediated neurotransmission on the escalation of METH self-administration. The hypothesis to be tested is that autoreceptor signaling directly limits METH intake, and that neurotensin-induced depression of this signal contributes to the escalation of self-administration observed with prolonged access to the drug. The results of these studies will identify key cellular mechanisms responsible for decreased autoreceptor signaling, and will determine how this decrease in dendrodendritic DA neurotransmission produces escalation of METH self-administration. These findings will provide a detailed understanding of the relationship between neurotensin, DA neuron activity and METH self-administration and will lay the foundation for therapeutics targeting neurotensin- and autoreceptor-mediated signaling."

"9487879","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         The amyloid plaques made of Ab peptide and neurofibrillary tangles made of abnormal tau protein define the neuropathology of Alzheimer's disease. Many diverse studies support an initiating role for amyloid in Alzheimer's disease. However, these findings also clearly demonstrate both that the presence of tau is required for amyloid mediated neuronal dysfunction and that pathological tau protein causes neurodegeneration. Furthermore, pathological tau, including neurofibrillary tangles, characterizes the neuropathology of blast induced traumatic brain injury, chronic traumatic encephalopathy, and other related tauopathies. Traumatic brain injury is increasingly prevalent in the Veteran population. Both aging related changes and brain injury dramatically increase the risk for neurodegenerative dementia disorders. Thus it is imperative we develop treatments that can quickly bridge the gap between bench and bedside. Development of pharmacological interventions for tau mediated neurodegeneration is the long-term goal of this research project. Our drug discovery strategy employs an integrated approach aimed at expediting drug repurposing. Our previously published work demonstrated the effectiveness of these methods by screening a library of 1120 approved drugs to identify a single validated compound capable of ameliorating tau pathology in a transgenic mouse model of tauopathy. We now propose to extend this drug repositioning approach to a drug collection spanning most of the drugs with a history of clinical use (~5400 drugs). The objectives of this project are to: Identify compounds reducing tau aggregation in a transgenic C. elegans model of tauopathy and in a human cell culture model of tau aggregation; Prioritize hits based on their CNS penetration and identify dosing and routes of administration that modulate pathological tau in young mice; Use novel compounds identified above to intervene in symptomatic tauopathy mice. Completion of these studies will reveal FDA approved candidate drugs for use as tau targeted therapeutics for both Alzheimer's disease and blast induced traumatic brain injury, providing justification for the clinical testing of repurposed approved drugs for treatment of tauopathy disorders."
"9469302","PROJECT SUMMARY: Biopsychosocial Reserves of Dementia Dementia is a devastating neurocognitive disorder that negatively impacts independence and significantly contributes to the global mortality rate. Alzheimer?s disease, the most prevalent form of dementia, is the fifth- leading cause of death for individuals 65 years of age and older. Instances of Alzheimer?s disease and related dementias (ADRD) increase exponentially in later life and behavioral cues emerge decades prior to formal diagnosis. Greater levels of cognitive variability and accelerated cognitive decline are precursors for ADRD. Intra-individual changes in cognitive performance vary across the lifespan and by cognitive dimension. For example, crystallized abilities (culture and semantic-based abilities; i.e., verbal, procedural memory) tend to be maintained in later life whereas fluid abilities (innate aspects; i.e., response time, working memory) peak earlier in life. Building biopsychosocial reserves (i.e., physical robustness, healthy diet, social engagement, genetic factors, adequate sleep, personality) earlier in life are protective against cognitive decline. This predoctoral fellowship proposal aims to investigate the relationship between biopsychosocial reserves and ADRD through the mediating role of cognitive abilities in a longitudinal manner using data from the Honolulu- Asia Aging Study. The Honolulu-Asia Aging Study provides rich longitudinal biological and psychosocial data on 8,006 participants who were assessed for more than 45 years; participants were 45-64 years of age at baseline. Specifically, this study will determine the relationship between biopsychosocial reserves and changes in cognitive abilities. The study will also investigate the association of profiles of change in cognitive abilities and ADRD. Finally, it will establish the overall relationship between biopsychosocial reserves and ADRD through the mediating role of cognitive ability profiles over time. Each of the research aims will be evaluated through quantitative methods employing latent variable and structural equation modeling techniques. This research also serves as a mechanism to further advance the fellow?s expertise in areas of epidemiology of dementia, biological underpinnings of cognitive dysfunction, and advanced statistical methodology. This project supports the NIA?s mission and Alzheimer?s disease initiatives to understand diseases and conditions associated with growing older in order to extend healthy active years of life by employing comprehensive and longitudinal models to study cognitive health using uniquely long-lived individuals. This approach will effectively identify lifespan behaviorally-based cognitive protective factors, thus enhancing health and cognition among older adults. Results of the proposed study will contribute to the understanding of biopsychosocial reserves to promote cognitive health in later life as well as implications for developing interventions and preventions for cognitive decline."
"9486849","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):          The objective of our study is to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the sexually dimorphic effects of early life stress (ELS) on pain perception in female veterans. Our overarching hypothesis is that exposure to adversity in early life predisposes female veterans to heightened visceral pain via a central mechanism involving abnormalities in brain-gut communication. RESEARCH PLAN: Under Specific Aim 1, we will test the hypothesis that stress in early life serves as a risk factor for heightened pain in adulthood produced by chronic stress. Having identified in preliminary experiments increases in stress-responsive genes within the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA) of female rats exposed to ELS, in Specific Aim 2 we will test the hypothesis that heightened pain perception in adulthood following ELS is mediated by central increases in stress-responsive genes. Specific Aim 3 will explore the hypothesis that centrally driven epigenetic changes make an individual more susceptible to chronic stress and contribute to the sexually dimorphic effects of ELS on pain perception in adult female rats. METHODOLOGY: We will employ validated rats models that recapitulate visceral pain in patients. Specifically, we will measure colonic sensitivity by quantifying the number of abdominal cramps in response to colonic distension. Stress in early life will be induced by odor shock conditioning in neonatal rat pups. Stress in adulthood will result from repeated exposure for 1 hour each day to a water avoidance stressor (WAS). We will investigate whether ELS serves as a predisposing risk factor for heightened visceral pain in response to chronic WAS in adulthood. We also will investigate whether knockdown of amygdaloid gene expression using specific antisense oligodeoxynucleotides (ODNs) inhibits the development of pain following ELS. Finally we will use an array of epigenetic approaches targeting histone acetyltransferases within the CeA to gain further mechanistic insight into stress-induced visceral pain. ANTICIPATED RESULTS: For Specific Aim 1 we expect to show that rats experiencing adult stress will have visceral hypersensitivity compared to controls. However, we anticipate that that there will be a greater visceral sensitivity to the adult stress following ELS. We also expect an exaggerated activation of the HPA axis indicated by an elevated systemic CORT and ACTH, as well as increased fecal pellet output (FPO) in response to WAS in all experimental groups, however the magnitude of the change will be greater in response to ELS. For Specific Aim 2, we anticipate that imbalances of stress responsive genes contribute to abnormal visceral pain perception in adulthood following ELS. In experiments proposed under specific aim 3 we expect to show that heightened visceral pain following ELS may be modulated through epigenetically mediated mechanisms within the CeA. RELEVANCE TO VETERANS HEALTH: The VA provides specialized health care for female veterans, however limited research has focused on illnesses experienced by female Veterans. Of importance to this proposal, female veterans with anxiety-related disorders have higher rates of childhood abuse. Our findings may identify novel approaches to improve the treatment of pain in female Veterans."
"9486883","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Chronic HCV infection and associated liver disease are associated with impaired response to HBV/HAV vaccine and greater morbid outcomes upon pathogen exposure, yet strategies to improve these prophylactic vaccine responses are not available. Though effectiveness of HCV therapy will continue to improve, the substantial majority of HCV infected individuals remain untreated, and improving vaccine response will remain an important goal over the coming decade. Effects of HCV on the immune system that may contribute to impaired vaccine response include decreased naive CD4 cell and dendritic cell (DC) subset numbers, skewing of T-, B- and NK-cell subsets, and T cell exhaustion. Additionally, chronic HCV infection and associated liver disease are associated with immune activation (sCD14, LPS, IL-6, HLA-DR+CD38+CD4/8 cells). Emerging evidence, including our data, indicates HCV associated immune activation (CD16+56-NK subset frequency and sCD14) correlates with disease stage and negatively predicts host response to IFN therapy. To identify molecular drivers of immune activation we performed a non-biased comprehensive plasma proteome analysis to determine the correlates of immune activation. Our lead molecule was plasma ENPP2 (autotaxin). ENPP2 was elevated during HCV infection with advanced liver disease, and best correlated with CD4 activation during HCV infection. The product of ENPP2 activity, lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), activates T cells, providing a potential pathway amenable to therapeutic interruption. We propose HCV induced immune activation impairs host response to neoantigen (e.g. vaccine and new infectious challenge). Supporting this, during HIV infection where immune activation also exists, our preliminary data indicate higher CD4+HLADR+CD38+ T cell frequency negatively predicts host response to Hepatitis A vaccine, while greater naive CD4+ numbers positively predict response. Recent evidence also indicates markers of immune activation negatively predict HBV vaccine response during HCV infection. Older age is also associated with susceptibility to infection and impaired response to vaccine. The combined effects of aging and chronic HCV infection on the immune system are not yet characterized, but highly significant as this patient population continues to grow. Importantly, we observed that both aging and chronic HCV infection result in higher ENPP2 levels. Therefore ENPP2 may be a common therapeutic target, and an ideal metric in our proposed analyses. With the growing age of the US and VA HCV infected population, and with morbidity (cirrhosis, HCC, impaired therapy response) projected to peak in 2030 primarily in the aged HCV population, we propose that quantifying the combined effects of age and chronic HCV infection on the immune system, and the impact of ENPP2 on the neoantigen response will guide therapeutic strategies. In Aim 1 we will Determine the independent contributions of untreated HCV, immune activation, age, ENPP2 and LPA to neoantigen (hepatitis A/B vaccine) vs. recall antigen (tetanus booster vaccine) response. In Aim 2 we will Determine the effect of ENPP2 inhibition on murine host response to neoantigen in the setting of chronic LCMV infection."
"9487897","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Sleep loss leads to impaired cognitive performance and excessive daytime sleepiness. These symptoms of sleep loss are now recognized as major contributors to accident rates and decreased workplace productivity. Mice will be used to model two types of human sleep loss that produce daytime sleepiness and cognitive impairments: 1) Total sleep deprivation, which can occur due to vocational demands such as shift work or emergency work, and, 2) Sleep fragmentation, a pattern of sleep disturbance seen in many clinical disorders including sleep apnea. Sleep fragmentation disrupts the continuity of sleep and interferes with the restorative effects of sleep. Despite the fact that total sleep time is not greatly reduced by sleep fragmentation, we hypothesize that the physiological and behavioral consequences of sleep fragmentation will be similar to those of total sleep deprivation. The overall goal of this proposa is to understand the role of basal forebrain (BF) neurons in sleep loss induced deficits in wakefulness and vigilance. To accomplish this goal, mice will be used to test the hypothesis that BF GABAergic parvalbumin (PV) and cholinergic - positive neurons enhance wakefulness/alertness, attention, and cortical activation. Both BF PV and cholinergic neurons are hypothesized to be arousal promoting via their cortical projections. Hence, we predict that activation of these arousal promoting BF neurons can reduce sleep-loss induced impairments. Based on preliminary data, we further hypothesize that BF PV neurons will more potently enhance wakefulness, attention, and cortical activation relative to BF cholinergic neurons; PV neurons are also predicted to more effectively reduce the impairments in these measures observed in sleep deprived mice. Abundant evidence indicates that the BF contains cortically projecting and wakefulness promoting neurons that are important for cortical activation and wakefulness (e.g., large non-specific cell body lesions in BF produce a coma-like state). However, only recently have optogenetic methods been available to precisely determine the role of neurotransmitter specific neurons in the brain. Optogenetic inhibition of BF neurons in Aim 1 is predicted to simulate the effects of sleep loss, demonstrating the necessity of BF PV and cholinergic neurons in the sleep loss induced impairments. Aim 2 will determine if: a) excitation of BF neurons is sufficient to enhance wakefulness, attention, and cortical activation in non sleep deprived mice, and, b) excitation of BF neurons will reduce sleep loss induced impairments in wakefulness, attention, and cortical activation. Aim 3 will measure the single unit activity of optogenetically identified BF neurons to confirm that their discharge pattern is consistent with their proposed physiological role in the regulation of natural sleep and wakefulness, and in the mediation of the cortical activity responses to sensory stimuli. The following preliminary data support these hypotheses and predictions: 1. Inhibition of PV neurons reduces measures of wakefulness, attention in the novel object recognition task, and evoked cortical activation; thus, the effects of inhibition of BF PV neurons closely resemble the effects f sleep loss on these measures. 2. Excitation of BF PV neurons produces wakefulness and cortical activation and BF PV unit activity is increased during wakefulness. Compared to BF PV neurons, excitation of cholinergic neurons appears to produce a more modulatory, slower and less powerful behavioral and physiological response. If successful, the experiments proposed will demonstrate mechanistic links between BF unit activity, cortical activation, wakefulness/arousal, and attention. Thus, these findings will guide the development of therapeutic interventions targeting the subcortical arousal promoting neurons to treat the consequences of sleep disorders which are prevalent in the Veteran population."
"9378376","Every day, 22 veterans complete suicide, primarily due to the ramifications of untreated depression. Due to fear and stigma, many do not seek treatment. For those who do, about one third of the time, no drug offers relief and even those antidepressants that do work often require 6-8 weeks before therapeutic onset. Unfortunately, no unifying hypothesis for a molecular/cellular basis of action for antidepressant drugs (or depressive disorders) has emerged. Over the last several years, we have suggested that, in addition to pre- synaptic targets (uptake sites), a number of antidepressant drugs have a post-synaptic mechanism of action. Toward this end, we have observed that chronic treatment (3-5 days) of cultured neural or glial cells with a number of chemically diverse antidepressant compounds translocates the heterotrimeric G protein G?s outof lipid rafts and into a closer association with adenylyl cyclase. Post-mortem tissue from depressed suicides shows just the opposite, with an increased proportion of G?s ensconsed in lipid rafts and preliminary data suggest that this is also observed in blood cells, where the extent of G?s in lipid rafts correlates with both depression and clinical response to antidepressants. Furthermore, several experimental compounds may have antidepressant effects as well as shorter therapeutic onset, and the proposed studies will search for a cellular ?biosignature? for antidepressant action. Proposed studies will also attempt to establish a mechanistic understanding for the translocation of G?s from lipid rafts as a hallmark of depression and as a conduit for antidepressant action. During the period covered by this proposal, we will pay particular attention to short- acting antidepressants like ketamine. One intent of the proposed studies is to develop a platform that can provide a cell- based screen for putative antidepressant compounds as well as a screening tool to indicate personalized antidepressant choice. Another intent of these studies is to provide a peripheral tissue biological marker for depression and an early (< 1 week) indicator of successful antidepressant treatment that can be developed into a clinically useful, inexpensive and simple biomarker for clinical use. The identification of a pathway for antidepressant action might lead to novel antidepressant drugs, while the assignation of a quantitative value for depression may help overcome stigma and encourage thousands of depressed veterans to seek treatment."
"9378394","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is the most common liver disease among veterans and is characterized by hepatic steatosis, sterile inflammation and liver damage [1]. NASH is associated with the metabolic syndrome, and can progress to cirrhosis and cancer. The mechanisms governing NASH development are not known, and currently there is no effective therapy. We have shown that the DNA receptor TLR9 (TOLL like receptor 9) is required for acute sterile inflammation in the liver and pancreas [2-4]. Here we propose to examine role of cell-free DNA (cfDNA) in TLR9 activation and its importance in murine and human NASH. Our hypothesis is that increased levels of mitochondrial DNA from hepatocytes contributes to the development of NASH via TLR9 activation on Kupffer cells, monocytes and hepatocytes.  We will focus on identifying the cellular source and biochemical (oxidation) status of cfDNA, and the functional role of cfDNA in NASH. Our data will support the progression to clinical trials of a TLR9 antagonist that has already been safely used in humans. Preliminary data: i) Plasma levels of cfDNA are higher in mice fed a HFD and in obese patients with NASH, and the cfDNA is of mitochondrial origin. ii) Plasma from NASH subjects has an increase in intact mitochondria (mt), and the majority are in microparticles (MP). iii) Plasma DNA from mice with NASH is a potent ligand for TLR9. iv) Increased ability of plasma from NASH patients to activate a TLR9 reporter cell line is significantly reduced when MP are removed. v) Increase in oxidation state of mtDNA in plasma from patients with NASH. vi) Total body deletion of TLR9 results in less NASH in a HFD model of NASH. vii) Selective deletion of TLR9 on macrophages results in less NASH. viii) Hepatocytes mtDNA from mice fed a HFD has a greater degree of oxidation and a greater ability to stimulate inflammatory, but not anti-inflammatory pathway. ix) The TLR9 antagonist IRS954 protects mice against NASH. Aim 1: Identify the cellular origin and biochemical characteristics of DNA responsible for TLR9 activation in NASH. Aim 2: Identify the cell specific effects of TLR9 activation on a) monocytes and Kupffer cells and b) hepatocytes. Aim 3: Identify the role of mtDNA oxidation on the selective activation of pro-inflammatory pathways, and test a clinically available TLR9 antagonist in a mouse model of NASH. This grant will identify the cellular origins of the elevated the TLR9 ligand plasma cfDNA in NASH, and identify if the development of NASH increases the ability of DNA to function as a ligand for TLR9. It will further establish the role of TLR9 activation on KC, monocytes, and hepatocytes in the development of HFD NASH. Finally demonstration of the efficacy of a clinically available TLR9 antagonist in a mouse model of NASH will allow for the rational progression to clinical trials."
