"9436441","Project Summary Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) leads to over 30,000 deaths each year in the United States (US) alone with a two-year survival rate of ~6%. Unlike the other major subtypes of lung cancer, there are currently no targeted therapies approved for SCLC. SCLC is initially highly responsive to chemotherapy, but rapidly develops resistance leading to mortality in an average of 10 months. Clearly, a major unmet need for the treatment of SCLC is the identification of new therapeutic targets and treatment strategies to combat this deadly disease. SCLC uniformly lacks activity of the RB1 and TP53 tumor suppressors. One of the most frequent oncogenic events in SCLC is mutually exclusive amplification of a MYC family member, including MYC, MYCL or MYCN. Kinases are not frequently altered in SCLC and until recently, there have been few genetically-engineered mouse models (GEMMs) of the disease. Previous GEMMs exhibit long latencies, variable histologies and reportedly fail to mimic the initial chemo-sensitivity found in human SCLC. To address these challenges, we developed a novel GEMM of SCLC driven by loss of Rb1, Trp53 and overexpression of c-Myc?three of the most common genetic alterations in human SCLC. Mice develop SCLC within five weeks that highly resembles the human disease at the level of histopathology, biomarker expression and chemo-sensitivity followed by relapse. Our in vitro studies identified exquisite sensitivity of mouse and human SCLC cell lines to mitotic checkpoint inhibitors, some of which are in clinical trials but on their own lead to modest effects in a fraction of patients. The objective of this study is to use this novel GEMM to test the efficacy of mitotic checkpoint inhibitors specifically in c-MYC-driven SCLC in vivo, both as monotherapies and in combination with the standard-of-care chemotherapy. Second, we will perform a novel anchor screen with mitotic checkpoint inhibitors to identify small molecules that synergize with mitotic checkpoint inhibition in c-MYC-driven SCLC. We hypothesize that mitotic checkpoint inhibitors will significantly improve chemotherapy response in vivo, and that inhibitors of DNA damage repair, apoptosis or other processes will cooperate to produce greater efficacy. To test these hypotheses, we will: 1) Determine whether AURKA, AURKB or PLK1 inhibitors block tumor growth and prolong survival of mice with c-MYC-driven SCLC, and 2) Identify small molecules that synergize with Aurora kinase inhibition in c-MYC-driven SCLC using an alisertib-based anchor screen. This approach is innovative because we will use a novel immune-competent GEMM of SCLC that recapitulates key features of the human disease. Anchor screens with mitotic checkpoint inhibitors have not been performed in SCLC. This research is significant because lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in the US and there are currently no targeted therapies approved for SCLC. A better understanding of the therapeutic vulnerabilities of c-MYC-driven SCLC will impact the treatment and survival of patients with this intractable disease."
"9471622","ABSTRACT Support is requested for a Keystone Symposia conference entitled Translational Systems Immunology organized by Drs. Sally John, Soumya Raychaudhuri, Michael Vincent and Mark M. Davis. The conference will be held January 28 - February 1, 2018 in Snowbird, Utah. Advances in large-scale data acquisition, immune phenotyping and computational biology are transforming immunology research and allowing unprecedented insights into the networks, pathways and systems that influence human health and disease. This meeting will cover the exciting technology advances that are enhancing our ability to elucidate human immune function and networks as well as practical applications in drug and biomarker discovery and patient stratification. The meeting begins with a look at progress in human genetics and the use of sequencing to assign functional mutations to rare human immune phenotypes. The impact of common variants on immune function requires larger sample sizes, and speakers will cover how genome-wide high-throughput genomics in combination with detailed phenotyping and physiologically relevant perturbations are providing foundational data sets that allow an unbiased view of immune function in cells and tissues. Also discussed will be emerging computational and analytical methods that enable integration and interpretation of high-content molecular data. The meeting will then move on to look at the application of these technological advances, expanding investigation to study the immune response in tissues and organs to enable a deeper understanding of interaction between immune and non-immune cells and their respective roles in disease states. Critical to clinical progress is the translation of systems immunology research into novel therapies and diagnostic or prognostic tests. Sessions themed around infectious disease and vaccine development advances in immune-oncology and patient stratification in complex disease and treatment response aim to provide depth from foundational science to clinical translation. Finally, a key goal is fostering collaboration across disciplines and the development of novel ideas. The meeting will be relevant for immunologists, computational biologists and clinicians with an interest in molecular characterization of the immune system."
"9387458","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hypercapnia (high pCO2) is observed in patients with lung diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), cystic fibrosis, broncho-pulmonary dysplasia and advanced neuromuscular diseases. Also, a ventilation strategy that includes permissive hypercapnia is commonly used in mechanically ventilated patients with the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Data from our group and others have challenged the existing paradigm suggesting that hypercapnia is beneficial for patients with ARDS. Instead, we have reported that elevated levels of CO2 have direct, deleterious effects on alveolar epithelial function and host immunity. Our published reports and data from preliminary studies in preparation for this proposal support our hypothesis that high levels of CO2 decrease alveolar epithelial cell migration and proliferation in the injured lung, thus, impairing lung injuy repair. Furthermore, we hypothesize that hypercapnia promotes the ubiquitin-proteasome mediated degradation of diaphragmatic myofibers and impairs the function of muscle satellite cells required for its regeneration. As such, in this application we propose to determine the mechanisms by which hypercapnia leads to impaired recovery from lung injury and the effect of high CO2 on diaphragm muscle degradation and impaired regeneration. We will test these hypotheses in three interrelated aims: in experiments pertaining to specific aim # 1, we will determine whether hypercapnia-mediated inhibition of GEFs-Rac1 leads to impaired cell migration; in experiments pertaining to specific aim #2, we will determine whether high CO2 via the miR-183/96/182 cluster impairs alveolar epithelial cell migration in vitro and lung injury repar in vivo; and in studies pertaining to specific aim # 3, we will determine whether hypercapnia leads to diaphragm dysfunction causing muscle degradation via the ubiquitin/proteasomal pathway and impaired muscle regeneration. We have conducted preliminary experiments for each of the specific aims which support the feasibility of this grant proposal. The proposed experiments will generate novel information on the mechanisms by which exposure to hypercapnia impairs alveolar epithelial and diaphragm function, which is of clinical significance for patients with ARDS who require mechanical ventilation and patients with chronic lung diseases and hypercapnia."
"9392146","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Endometrial cancer (EMC) is a malignant disease with high mortality in women. About 50,000 women in USA are annually diagnosed with EMC and ~8200 women die of this disease yearly. Thus, it is urgent to study the key molecular drivers and suppressors of EMC initiation, growth and metastasis for identifying new diagnostic/prognostic markers and therapeutic targets. NCOA6, a coactivator that works with multiple classes of transcription factors (TFs) to potentiate gene expression, appears to be frequently mutated and down- regulated in EMCs. Conditional knockout (KO) of Ncoa6 in the mouse endometrial epithelial (EC) and stromal cells causes estrogen super sensitivity, uterine epithelial hyperplasia and spontaneous EMC development. KO of Ncoa6 only in the endometrial ECs also triggered EMC development. Ncoa6 KO decreases the expression of DUSP6 and PTPRF, two phosphatases that inhibit the MAPK and PI3K/AKT pathways. NCOA6 KO also increases the expression of PRKCD, a PKC kinase that activates the Raf-ERK pathway and simulates cell migration and chemotaxis. We hypothesize that NCOA6 is a novel tumor suppressor of EMC, and it functions through controlling estrogen, MAPK and PI3K/AKT stimulated EC proliferation and carcinogenesis. In Aim 1, we will define the specific role of NCOA6 in suppressing estrogen-promoted EMC development. Transgenic mice with and without endometrial Ncoa6 KO will be produced to examine how the loss of Ncoa6 function will trigger and promote spontaneous EMC development in the endometrium with and without Pten expression under different estrogen conditions. Transgenic mice with a Ncoa6 mutation that prevents Ncoa6 interact with ER? will also be generated to test whether Ncoa6 relies on the interaction with ER? to suppress estrogen- promoted EMC development. In Aim 2, we will dissect the basic cellular and molecular mechanisms responsible for NCOA6-mediated repression of EMC. Specifically, we will use both bioinformatic and experimental approaches to identify TFs working with NCOA6 to regulate DUSP6, PRPTF and PRKCD genes. We will also use EMC cell lines and xenograft tumor growth mouse models to define the functional impacts of NCOA6-regulated expression of these 3 genes on the activities of MAPKs and AKT and on the capabilities of EMC cell proliferation, migration, invasion and tumor growth. In Aim 3, we will define the NCOA6 expression profile and its prognostic value in clinical subtypes of human endometrial tumors. We will semi-quantitatively measure NCOA6 protein expression levels in these specimens and determine the correlation/association relationships between NCOA6 expression levels and tumor grades, tumor stages, disease recurrence time or survival rates. These studies should generate significant impacts by establishing NCOA6 as an EMC suppressor and exploring its working mechanisms. These studies may also suggest NCOA6 as a diagnostic and a prognostic marker for EMC progression and offer a pre-clinical concept of principle to restore the function of NCOA6 or its regulatory pathways as a therapeutic strategy."
"9390490","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The atrioventricular canal is an important structure in the embryonic heart, involved in valve formation and in coordinating electrical impulse delay to ensure sequential activation and contraction of the atria and ventricles. Here we seek to understand how canonical Wnt signaling regulates the electrical programming of the atrioventricular (AV) junction through its regulation of ion channel gene expression and cardiac conduction. This area of study is significant because congenital and acquired arrhythmias, important causes of morbidity and mortality, may result from altered programs of gene expression that influence ion channel gene expression and cardiac conduction. Loss of canonical Wnt signaling within embryonic myocardium results in congenital heart defects involving the AV junction, including tricuspid valve atresia. Here we will investigate the mechanism for how Wnt signaling regulates morphologic development of the AV junction, as well as the electrical patterning of this tissue, with the following aims: 1. Delineate the mechanisms by which myocardial Wnt signaling regulates atrioventricular canal morphogenesis. Using genetic mouse models to perform gain- and loss-of-function of canonical Wnt signaling, we will assess the role of Wnt in regulating the proliferation, migration and differentiation of epicardial and endocardial cells within the AV junction. We will elucidate whether Wnt signaling is required for postnatal maintenance of the AV junction, and whether Wnt activation is sufficient to induce ectopic AV junctions in the postnatal heart. 2: Identify direct targets of canonical Wnt signaling that promote an atrioventricular junction phenotype. Based on our preliminary data, Wnt globally regulates the phenotype of the AV junction. We will perform chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) for ?-catenin, the key transcriptional effector of Wnt signaling, as well as enhancer mutagenesis assays, to determine how Wnt regulates the expression of the transcription factor Tbx3. We will perform RNA-sequencing and ChIP followed by massively parallel DNA sequencing (ChIP-seq) to identify novel putative downstream Wnt target genes and their regulatory elements. 3: Elucidate the mechanisms for Wnt-mediated regulation of cardiac conduction. Our preliminary data demonstrate that perturbation of Wnt signaling during development alters AV conduction and expression of sodium channels and gap junctions. Using ChIP-qPCR in gain- and loss-of-function mouse mutants, we will determine how sodium channel expression is regulated by Wnt signaling We will determine whether altered ventricular conduction velocity in Wnt mutant mice is associated with changes in Nav1.5 and/or gap junction protein expression and phosphorylation. Using optical mapping techniques, we will elucidate whether Wnt signaling dynamically regulates cardiac conduction in the adult heart."
"9402008","Project Summary/Abstract  We have smartly formulated a large collection of novel TnCs to enhance or reduce cardiac muscle contractility in vivo. Using gene therapy approaches, we will test whether these engineered proteins can be used as novel therapies against a wide spectrum of acquired and inherited cardiac diseases. Specifically, we have developed a novel approach to enhance cardiac muscle contractility without compromising relaxation or making the heart an arrhythmic substrate. We have also engineered a novel approach to reduce hypercontractility of a diseased heart and enhance its relaxation. Furthermore, these studies will establish the potential of using engineered TnCs as a therapeutic tool to help patients suffering from several different cardiovascular diseases.  We recently demonstrated that our smartly formulated L48Q TnC therapeutically increases in vivo cardiac contractility, function and performance after an MI. Our new exciting preliminary data demonstrates that cardiac contractility, function and performance can also be enhanced by L48Q TnC following a transverse aortic constriction (TAC; pressure overload on the left heart), without compromising relaxation/diastolic function. The purpose of this proposal is multifold and will: 1) demonstrate the broader therapeutic impact and clinical relevance of our smartly formulated TnCs on cardiovascular diseases with vastly different etiologies; 2) determine whether increasing contractility preserves cardiac function and performance of the right heart in pulmonary hypertension and the left heart in TAC; and 3) determine whether our smartly formulated TnCs can be used to combat inherited restrictive, hypertrophic and dilated cardiomyopathies. Aim 1. Determine if our smartly formulated TnCs can improve heart function in right and left sided he art failure .  Pressure overload of the right and left heart are common and devastating diseases that compromise cardiac function and performance. Our battery of examinations will thoroughly test if cardiac muscle contractility can be tuned from the myocyte to in vivo by our novel engineered TnCs to combat left and right heart pressure overload. Aim 2. Determine if smartly formulated TnCs can improve heart function in inherited  cardiomyopathies that  model the  human diseases.  Inherited cardiomyopathies also compromise the contractility of the heart. We will test if smartly formulated TnCs can be used to combat these diverse cardiac diseases and improve the in vivo function and performance of the heart. The completion of this proposal will establish the potential of our novel translational strategies to help combat a broad range of cardiovascular diseases."
"9388381","PROJECT SUMMARY Our laboratories have a long-standing interest in immune tolerance in transplantation, with a particular focus on regulatory T cells (Tregs). While Tregs expressing Foxp3 are required for normal immune homeostasis increasing data suggests that this lineage of cells may be unstable (e.g., as a result for example of inadequate IL-2, TCR and CD28 stimulation, or due to exposure to inflammatory cytokines), meaning that Tregs can revert/convert to effector T cells and thus contribute to loss of tolerance to self or to allografts. One of the key pathways controlling lymphocyte lineage specification and responsiveness is the PI3K pathway, which can be activated via CD28 and the IL-2R. While PI3K is essential for conventional T cell responses, over activation of the PI3K pathway dramatically inhibits Treg development. The primary regulator of PI3K activity in T cells is the lipid phosphatase PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog on chromosome 10). To investigate how PI3K controls Tregs, we created mice with PTEN deleted specifically in Tregs by breeding mice with a PTENfl/fl allele with Foxp3-YFP-Cre knock-in animals to generate PTEN-DTreg mice. Surprisingly, although these mice have elevated numbers of Tregs, a high proportion of those cells are CD25- and CD62Llo, and the animals are susceptible to induced autoimmunity and ultimately develop a severe polyclonal lymphoproliferative disorder. Interestingly, preliminary studies suggest that PTEN-deficient Tregs may have profound metabolic alterations, including over-reliance on glycolysis (vs. oxidative metabolism) for energy. Moreover, inhibition of glycolysis restores CD25 levels to normal. This has led us to formulate the hypothesis that PI3K activity induced via inflammation may disrupt Treg homeostasis due to reduced cytokine receptor expression, altered metabolism and apparent loss of regulatory capacity. Our goals are to determine how PI3K in Tregs controls Treg homeostasis and whether drug targeting of the PI3K pathway can stabilize Tregs. To do so, we have three aims. In Aim #1, we will use fate mapping mice to examine how PTEN loss alters Treg stability and function under homeostatic conditions, and in a well characterized model of autoimmunity. In Aim #2, we will determine the mechanism by which PI3K controls CD25 expression, examine how loss of PTEN alters Treg metabolism, define what role these changes play in Treg homeostasis and stability, and identify drugs which modulate metabolism that can be used to stabilize Tregs in vitro. In Aim #3, we will apply these findings, and pharmacologic manipulation to transplantation models, including a humanized mouse model, to develop means to optimize Treg stability and function. Together, these studies will yield new insights into Treg signaling pathways and provide potential therapeutics strategies to enhance immune tolerance."
"9406155","Pathological hypertrophy is a common predecessor to heart failure (HF). The heart also grows in response to exercise but this growth, termed physiological hypertrophy, does not generally lead to adverse consequences and can even protect the heart against pathological stress. There is a fundamental gap in our understanding of why cardiac hypertrophy can have such divergent outcomes. Our over-arching hypothesis is that there are distinct forms of hypertrophy, which may appear superficially similar but have dramatically different likelihoods of progressing to HF. Our long-term goal is to understand the pathways responsible for these differences and learn whether they can be exploited therapeutically. The objective of the current application is to understand the role of the microRNA (miRNA), miR-222, in pathological hypertrophy and HF. Prior work from the applicant's laboratory identified 16 cardiac miRNAs that were concordantly regulated in two distinct exercise models. Of these, miR-222, which is also increased in serum of HF patients after exercise, was necessary for exercise-induced physiological cardiac growth. While miR-222 was not sufficient to induce cardiac hypertrophy at baseline, it was sufficient to protect against adverse remodeling after ischemic injury. The role of miR-222 in pathological hypertrophy and HF remains unexplored. Based on preliminary data presented in this application, we hypothesize that miR-222 ? despite being involved in physiological hypertrophy ? paradoxically protects against pathological hypertrophy and the progression to HF. Moreover, we hypothesize that miR-222 acts as a nodal modulator of physiological versus pathological genetic programs at least in part through effects on two transcription factors: HMBOX1 and NFATc3. These central hypotheses will be tested in three integrated Specific Aims. In Aim 1, we will use specific and effective gain- and loss-of-function models to directly assess the role of miR-222 in pathological hypertrophy and HF. In Aim 2, a combination of expression profiling and bioinformatic analyses will be used to identify downstream targets of miR-222 and delineate the mechanisms responsible for its effects in pathological hypertrophy and HF. In Aim 3, a novel technology termed CombiGEM (Combinatorial Genetics En Masse), recently developed by our collaborator, Dr. Tim Lu of the MIT Synthetic Biology group, will be used to investigate the additive or synergistic effects of miRNAs altered in exercised hearts. In vivo studies will be supported by in vitro investigation of primary cardiomyocytes to elucidate the underlying mechanisms. Our approach combines innovative hypotheses, technologies, and unique animal models with the complementary expertise of an outstanding team of collaborating investigators. The proposed research is significant, because it is expected to advance our understanding of cardiac hypertrophy and HF as well as pathways with the potential to mitigate these clinically important conditions."

"9388352","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application is requested to further the career development of an academic pediatric ophthalmologist with a scientific interest in elucidating the response to intraocular surgery and discovery of novel therapies to prevent or treat postoperative complications in children and improve visual outcomes. The short-term goal is to develop the candidate's career as a clinician-scientist by expanding her understanding of ocular immunology and pathology and improve her research design, techniques and analysis skills. This will be achieved with mentorship, practical training, coursework, and involvement in a network of investigators.  The environment at the University of Illinois is an ideal institution fo the candidate to transition to independence because of the available facilities, faculty, staff, an financial support. The priority of the Medical School and Department of Ophthalmology and Visual Sciences at the University of Illinois are to nurture early career clinician-scientists into independent investigators. They have demonstrated this commitment in the form of material, financial, technical, and administrative support for the candidate to achieve the goals of this proposal.  There is a significant clinical need for the prevention and treatment of postoperative complications from exaggerated inflammation and fibrosis in children because of the risk of irreversible decreased vision from amblyopia. The objective of this proposal is to establish age-related changes in aqueous humor inflammatory mediators and determine the effect of pharmacologic intervention on inflammation and fibrosis after intraocular surgery. This will be accomplished with three specific aims: Specific Aim 1. Establish differences in aqueous humor inflammatory mediators before and after intraocular surgery in children and adults.  Intraocular fluid samples from subjects who are surgically na?ve and with a history of surgery will be analyzed with a Multiplex Bead-Based Immunoassay to simultaneously determine the levels of multiple inflammatory mediators. This will determine which proteins may be involved in the age-related response differences to intraocular surgery. Specific Aim 2. Determine changes in inflammation and fibrosis before and after intraocular surgery with aging in a rabbit model.  Lensectomy of juvenile, adolescent, and adult rabbits without postoperative treatment will be used as a model of age-related differences in response to intraocular surgery.  Analysis of aqueous humor inflammatory protein levels and comprehensive evaluation of clarity of the visual axis, inflammation and fibrosis, intraocular pressure, and corneal thickness will be used to systematically evaluate the response to lensectomy as rabbit's age. This will determine how aging affects inflammation and fibrosis in a rabbit model of lensectomy. Specific Aim 3. Determine the effect of intraocular pharmacologic intervention on inflammation and fibrosis in a juvenile rabbit model of lensectomy.  Inflammatory mediator levels will be analyzed, along with standardized postoperative evaluation of clarity of the visual axis, inflammation and fibrosis, intraocular pressure, and corneal thickness. This will identify the most effective pharmacologic intervention for the prevention and treatment of postoperative inflammation and fibrosis following juvenile rabbit lensectomy.  The findings from this proposal will serve as the scientific and technical foundation for future studies characterizing the response to intraocular surgery. These studies will identify novel age-related responses in eyes that may cause adverse outcomes after intraocular surgery in children. A clear understanding of the processes that result in complications from surgery will aid in the discovery of effective therapies. With effectie preventative and therapeutic interventions, we can have a lifelong impact by improving visual outcomes in children. The training, mentoring, and career development plan in this proposal will transition the candidate to an independent investigator making long-lasting contributions to the visual science community and vision care."
"9403246","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Most studies of human genomic variation, nutrition, and metabolic traits have focused on non- African populations. However, Africa is an important region to study as it is the site of origin of modern humans. Africa contains the greatest levels o human genetic variation and is the source of the worldwide range expansion of modern humans to regions outside of Africa. Several common complex diseases of metabolic origin, such as obesity, type 2 diabetes and certain cardiovascular diseases occur at higher frequency in African Americans, and are on the rise in urban centers in Africa. It has been postulated that this is due to genetic variants adaptive for past environments with intermittent access to food but maladaptive in nutritionally replete Westernized environments. Metabolomics technology has begun to provide insight into metabolic processes and can be used for biomarker identification for disease risk and provide insight into metabolic pathways associated with risk. Given the intimate relationship between nutrition and metabolism and subsequent disease risk, metabolomics provides a unique and powerful tool in nutritional research. In this proposal, we will exploit metabolomic profiling to interrogate extant plasma from a unique set of ethnically diverse, well phenotyped indigenous African populations who practice different subsistence patterns (agriculture, pastoralism, agro- pastoralism, and hunting-gathering) who vary markedly in markers of cardiometabolic risk. We will perform untargeted metabolomics profiling in a sample of 365 individuals and will do targeted profiling of informative metabolites in a sample of 1500 ethnically diverse Africans to identify differences in metabolites and metabolic pathways that correlate with diet and anthropometric and cardiovascular phenotypes associated with disease risk. We will integrate these data with a large genome-wide Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) and whole genome sequence dataset collected in the same individuals to gain insight into how genetic, nutritional and other environmental factors contribute to variation in cardiometabolic risk traits in ethnically diverse African populations."
"9390034","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of this proposal is to define the role of edible plant exosomal non-coding small RNA (nc-sRNA) in the prevention of gut inflammation using the dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) induced colitis and three other gut inflammatory related mouse models. Although evidence is supportive of the beneficial effects for most edible plants taken as part of the diet, the evidence that specific plant-based supplements are beneficial is controversial, and the underlying mechanisms are not clear. The challenge is to isolate and characterize the biological activities of the essential functional unit contained in specific naturl products to determine if and how it's cellular and molecular effects on the host can be used in a beneficial manner. Our recently published data (1-5) indicates that exosome-like nanoparticles (ELNs) present in a number of edible plants including grapefruit and ginger have anti-inflammatory properties. Mice fed grapefruit ELNs (FELNs) are protected against DSS induced mouse colitis. Up take of FELNs by intestinal macrophages inhibits the release of IL-1? and IL-6 and the induction of HO-1 and IL-10 expression. Our preliminary data further indicate that FELNs carry high levels of specific nc-sRNA that inhibit the induction of proinflammatory cytokines by targeting intestinal macrophages. The nc-sRNA is associated with inactivation of macrophage miR155. A specific FELN nc-sRNA complexed with naringin binds to miR155 and subsequently prevents miR155 binding to 3-UTRs of certain anti-inflammatory genes, thus inhibiting the induction of proinflammatory cytokines. We have also demonstrated that ginger ELN nc-sRNAs promotes the production of IL-10 in lamina propria macrophages under steady-state as well as inflammatory conditions. Therefore, we hypothesize that plant ELNs carrying the nc-sRNA bioactive complex are taken up by intestinal macrophages and subsequently bind to inflammatory microRNAs, resulting in inhibition of induction of chronic inflammation cytokines, thereby preventing chronic intestinal inflammation. Our hypothesis will be tested in vitro and in vivo to determine: (1) whether FELN taken up by intestinal macrophages leads to induction of tolerant dendritic cells (DCs) through nc-sRNA-155 mediated anti-inflammatory effects since DCs are critical for gut immune tolerance and homeostasis through cross-talk with intestinal macrophages; (2) the factors that regulate sorting of anti-inflammatory nc-sRNA-155 into macrophage exosomes; and (3) which ginger ELNs nc-sRNA(s) are required for induction of anti- inflammatory IL-10 expressed in macrophages. Demonstration of the ELNs complex targeting to gut inflammatory cells would be a significant step forward in the understanding of how the plant kingdom interacts with the mammalian species to regulate anti-inflammatory responses through ELNs. The data generated should provide a foundation for selecting specific ELNs from different types of plants for personalized complementary medicine for patients and determine whether oral administration of a customized exosome isolated from different plants will have a synergistic/additive effect on prevention or treatment of disease."
"9390064","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Prenatal environmental exposures are increasingly recognized as important risk factors for asthma. Critical exposures include urban air pollution and its component - diesel exhaust. The mechanisms are poorly characterized. This project seeks to address this gap in knowledge. To build a framework for mechanistic studies we have developed a mouse model. In this model, repeated exposure of pregnant mice to diesel exhaust particles (DEP) renders their offspring hypersensitive to the postnatal allergen - ovalbumin (OVA). These offspring develop asthma when subjected to suboptimal OVA sensitization and challenge. In contrast, pups born to unexposed dams do not develop asthma upon suboptimal OVA exposure. Our preliminary data indicate that asthma in this model is mediated by NK cells that produce IL-5, IL-13 and IL-17. Depletion of these cells using specific antibodies prevents asthma. We also show that IL-5/IL-13/IL-17+ NK cells are increased in human asthma. In addition to IL-5, IL-13 and IL-17 production, the pathogenic mouse NK cells are characterized by increased expression of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) signature transcripts (AhRR, Cyp1a1 and Cyp1b1). AhR is a transcriptional factor that is known to respond to organic compounds of DEP, namely, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH). AhR is also known to regulate the IL-17 gene transcription. Some reports suggest the positive role of AhR in IL-5 and IL-13 production. Thus, AhR provides a molecular link between maternal exposure to DEP and cytokine production in offspring NK cells. Based on these data, our overarching hypothesis is that in utero exposure to diesel exhaust promotes asthma susceptibility through AhR-dependent priming of NK cells. We propose following specific aims: 1) Examine the importance of NK cells in asthma susceptibility induced via prenatal exposure to DEP; 2) Study the role of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor in NK cell activation and maternal-fetal transmission of asthma risk; 3) Examine the persistence of the pathogenic DEP effect through the life of first and subsequent generations; 4) Examine the relevance of IL- 5/IL-13/IL-17+ NK cells and AhR/AhRR/Cyp1b1+ NK cells in human asthma. To meet these goals we will use NK cell-deficient mice, mice without adaptive immunity and mice with NK cell-specific deletion of AhR. We will also perform transfers of NK cells from prenatally exposed offspring to unexposed mice. To study preservation of asthma susceptibility throughout the offspring life we will use cross-fostering and delayed allergen exposure approaches. To study transgenerational effects of DEP exposure, we will examine asthma susceptibility in F2 and F3 offspring. To determine human relevance we will measure IL-5/IL-13/IL-17+ NK cells and AhR/AhRR/Cyp1b1+ NK cells in young children and adults with asthma. We will correlate NK cell results with amounts of PAH-DNA adducts (a measure of environmental exposure). Using an in vitro culture system we will determine whether DEP can skew non-polarized NK cells from non-allergic non-asthmatic donors into IL-5/IL- 13/IL-17-producing cells. We will then study the role of AhR in this process using a knockdown approach."
"9402009","ABSTRACT Heart failure is on the rise in epidemic global proportions affecting more than 23 million people worldwide including 5.8 million individuals in the US alone. Acute myocardial infarction (MI) leading to ischemic cardiomyopathy is the most common etiology for decreased ejection fraction heart failure. Cardiomyocytes derived from the human inducible pluripotent stem cells (hiPSC-CMs) are promising as a novel autologous cell- based therapy in heart disease. The current obstacles for cardiac regeneration using stem-cell based therapies include cell survival and maturity, anisotropic structure and alignment of elongated cardiomyocytes, electro-mechanical integration of the cardiac patch with the native myocardium, and rapid angiogenesis to support cardiomyocytes in the regenerating myocardium. The main objective of this proposal is to develop a thick mature and functional cardiac tissue that not only has the anisotropy of the native tissue but also stimulates rapid angiogenesis (1-week). We hypothesize that a combination of a functional multi-layered hiPSC-CMs cardiac patch paired with a bFGF scaffold significantly improves the early and late cardiomyocyte survival and promotes rapid angiogenesis. This hypothesis will be tested in the following three specific aims; Aim 1) This aim will determine the maturity, contractile function, and cell survivability of a hiPSC-CMs multi- layered aligned nanofiber cardiac patch in vitro, Aim 2) This aim will establish the efficacy of bFGF releasing scaffolds to enhance hiPSC-CMs survival and promote rapid angiogenesis in simulated ischemic conditions in vitro, Aim 3) This aim will determine efficacy of the transplanted multi-layered hiPSC-CMs cardiac patch paired with bFGF scaffold following myocardial infarction on cardiac function, cell engraftment, angiogenesis, tissue oxygenation and electro-mechanical integration, in an in vivo rat model of MI. Overall, this proposal will establish an innovative myocardial cell-based therapeutic strategy based on, (i) the combination of human iPSC-derived terminal differentiated cardiomyocytes with a biodegradable aligned nanofiber scaffold, (ii) bFGF- releasing scaffold to enhance early cell survival and rapid angiogenesis, and (iii) the non-invasive monitoring of myocardial tissue oxygenation and cell engraftment in vivo. The outcome of this project will enable us to develop a novel cardiac patch for translation into a large animal clinical model of MI for repairing the damaged heart."
"9392579","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Chronic hypertension and Pregnancy (CHAP) project is a large pragmatic multi-center randomized clinical trial designed to evaluate the comparative effectiveness and safety of pharmacologic treatment of mild chronic hypertension (CHTN) in pregnancy. During pregnancy, CHTN is the most common major medical disorder, most often mild (BP <160/110 mmHg), and associated with a 3-5 fold increase in adverse outcomes including preeclampsia, perinatal death, preterm birth (PTB) and small for gestational age (SGA) infants (birth weight <10th percentile). Whereas antihypertensive therapy is a public health priority for the general population, authorities, including the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), recommend against BP lowering therapy during pregnancy unless hypertension is severe, i.e., e160/110 mm Hg, because of uncertain benefits and the concern that therapy may actually increase the risk of SGA. Based on supportive preliminary data presented herein, we hypothesize that antihypertensive therapy for CHTN during pregnancy to the goal <140/90 mmHg as currently recommended for the non-pregnant hypertensive population, will reduce the risk of several adverse pregnancy outcomes including SGA. During a 6-year project period, our consortium of 12 academic perinatal centers (25 sites), will identify 4700 women with mild CHTN and BP<155/100 mmHg (which providers are more comfortable not treating) in early pregnancy and randomize them to either antihypertensive therapy (using labetalol) or to management according to ACOG recommendations (antihypertensive therapy for more severe CHTN). The women will be followed-up until discharge from the {hospital after delivery and up to 3 months postpartum (longer follow-up is anticipated separately; contingency funds will be considered for interim 6-month phone call). The following Specific Aims will be addressed: } {1.1 Primary Aim: To determine if pharmacologic treatment of mild CHTN in pregnancy to a standardized BP} goal<140/90 mmHg, compared with standard management (per ACOG: no treatment unless hypertension is severe), reduces the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes including: 1) a severe perinatal composite outcome (perinatal death, severe preeclampsia, placental abruption or indicated PTB <35 weeks) and 2) SGA. 1.2 Secondary Aims: i. To better quantify the risks of severe maternal cardiovascular outcomes associated with mild CHTN during pregnancy and determine the impact of treatment. ii. To investigate the optimal gestational age to deliver women with CHTN in order to minimize maternal and perinatal complications. We will apply survival analysis methods to the trial population. iii. To collect and store biospecimens including maternal blood, cord blood and placentas for future biological and biophysical studies to understand the effects of antihypertensive therapy in pregnant women with mild CHTN. iv. To assess whether antihypertensive treatment of mild CHTN during pregnancy increases post-pregnancy adherence to recommended therapy."
"9387466","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite advances in the understanding of underlying mechanisms, heart failure (HF) remains the major cause of mortality, indicating the urgent need in the development of novel unconventional therapeutic strategies. Abnormal intracellular calcium (Ca2+) handling has been implicated in the pathogenesis of malignant arrhythmias characteristic of Heart Failure (HF). Cardiac excitation-contraction (EC) coupling is mediated through Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release (CICR), which is controlled by sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca2+-sensitive Ca2+ channels, also known as cardiac ryanodine receptors (RyR2). MicroRNAs (miRs) are ~22-nucleotide-long nonprotein-coding RNAs that recognize their target mRNAs by base pairing interactions and subsequently inhibit gene expression by targeting these mRNAs for translational repression or degradation. Rapidly accumulating evidence implicates dysregulated miRs in cardiac pathogenesis including arrhythmias and HF rendering them new attractive targets for therapy. However, much work must be done for better understanding of miR functions. Our preliminary results implicate a family of miRs specific to muscle tissue called myomiRs in regulation of Ca2+ handling in cardiomyocytes. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that myomiRs which include miR-208a, miR-208b and miR-499 play a critical role in regulating Ca2+ homeostasis by modulating the structure and function of macromolecular complexes involved in Ca2+ handling. In order to test this hypothesis we have developed techniques to modify the expression of miRNAs in vitro and in intact hearts in vivo in order to examine their effects on Ca2+ cycling in single ventricular myocytes using electrophysiology and single photon laser scanning confocal microscopy. Specifically we aim to investigate the molecular determinants of myomiR-mediated regulation of SR Ca2+ release through RyR2s in ventricular myocytes, and test whether aberrant expression patterns of these miRs contribute to Ca2+-dependent arrhythmias characteristic of cardiac disease using rat model of heart failure."
"9378726","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):          Rates of alcohol use disorders are high among combat Veterans, and alcohol use disorder (AUD) is the most prevalent and costly substance use disorder among Veterans (SAMSHA, 2012). Current AUD is estimated at 16% in recently deployed veterans seeking VA care (VHA, 2011), and is approximately four times as common among combat Veterans than in the general population (Kessler et al., 2005). Care for individuals with AUD is standardized for across Veterans. An objective care framework that identifies individuals at highest risk for relapse may improve clinical outcomes. In addition, women may be more susceptible to consequences of problematic drinking behaviors than men, despite fewer years of drinking and less total drinks consumed yet research on AUD in women Veterans is sparse. Individuals with psychiatric co-morbidities have poorer outcomes than those with AUD alone, yet most research to date has excluded those with co-morbidities, leading to research results that are not generalizable to all Veterans with AUD. Evidence suggests that one component of the neurobiological mechanisms underlying AUD include dysregulation of emotional salience and reward circuits. It is not yet known exactly how dysfunction in brain circuits contribute to AUD, and how gender and co-morbidities moderate these effects, but research that answers these questions is critical.  The current diagnostic and assessment system does not provide a model for objectively identifying individuals at highest risk for relapse following treatment. The checklist of symptoms that defines AUD does not reflect underlying neurobiology, yet brain circuit function predisposes individuals to AUD (e.g., to relieve anxiety or seek reward) and the effects of AUD can produce chronic changes to these circuits even after abstinence. We also know that these circuits may be moderated by other individual characteristics such as gender and/or the presence of a psychiatric co-morbidity. Technological advances in brain imaging have revolutionized our capacity to understand the brain circuits that underlie complex behaviors such as addiction. The most significant advancement in brain imaging research has been to identify core nodes of the large-scale circuits that are dysfunctional in mental health disorders. Despite this advance, there  is a critical gap in integrated brain-based models of addiction.  The proposed CSR&D CDA-2 seeks to fill this gap by conducted a neuroimaging study to assess the degree to which disconnections in networks implicated in reward and emotion circuits contribute to risk of relapse following treatment. We will achieve this via three specific aims: Aim 1: Define the neural circuits of emotion and reward processing that underlie AUD in Veterans. Aim 2: Test the relationship between defined neural circuits and treatment outcome (abstinence vs. relapse) and probability of relapse risk. Aim 3: Explore the impact of gender, psychiatric co-morbidities, and craving on the model developed in Aim 2. To test these aims, we will recruit 100 Veterans (50 men and 50 women) from outpatient and residential substance use treatment programs. In order to provide the most generalizable information, we will not exclude female Veterans or those with co-occurring depression, anxiety and PTSD.  Currently there are no neuroimaging studies that have examined brain circuits as they relate to relapse risk in men and women Veterans with AUD. Findings from the proposed study will be the first to determine if brain circuits underlying in AUD can be used to predict relapse in this population. This study is a foundational first step and will lay the groundwork in using innovative neuroimaging technology to identify individuals at greatest risk who may need prolonged or more precise treatment strategies. This neuroscience based translational program of research will help vulnerable Veteran populations obtain more effective treatments and achieve better outcomes."
"9596923","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT This proposal describes a rigorous training program leading to the career development of Dr. Sarah Huen as an independent physician-scientist. The principal investigator is a board-certified nephrologist who recently completed a Ph.D. program in Investigative Medicine at Yale University studying mechanisms of repair and fibrosis in ischemic kidney injury. Her career goal is to become an independent investigator studying sepsis- related acute kidney injury. She proposes to expand her training in immunobiology through an intensive training research experience under the mentorship of Dr. Ruslan Medzhitov, a pioneer in innate immunity and inflammation. In addition to didactic coursework and development of technical research skills in immunobiology and sepsis, an advisory committee comprised of scientists and physician-scientists with a broad range of expertise related to the project will provide both scientific and career development guidance. The research objective of this proposal is to determine the role of the expression of Fibroblast growth factor-21 (FGF21) by the kidney in the setting of sepsis. Preliminary data for this proposal reveal that in the mouse model of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) sepsis there is robust induction of FGF21 expression in the renal tubular epithelium. Mice deficient of FGF21 have more kidney dysfunction and are more susceptible to mortality in LPS sepsis. The induction of Fgf21 in the kidney is unique to sepsis as its expression is not induced in sterile hemodynamic injuries. The expression of renal Fgf21 in LPS sepsis can be inhibited by the reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenger n-acetylcysteine. Our hypothesis is that FGF21 is a ROS-inducible kidney tissue protective pathway that is activated in response to sepsis. This hypothesis will be tested by pursuing these aims: 1) Determine the role of renal FGF21 in promoting survival in sepsis, and 2) Identify the stress response pathway and the source of ROS that regulate Fgf21 gene expression. The Yale University Departments of Nephrology and Immunobiology together have extensive scientific resources that will enable the successful achievement of these proposed aims. This proposal will define a novel renal defense mechanism activated in response to systemic infection while preparing the applicant to develop a successful independent research career as a physician-scientist."
"9386077","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): My long-term career goal is to develop an independent, funded research program that contributes to understanding the mechanisms by which obesity and type 2 diabetes lead to impaired vascular insulin signaling and cardiovascular disease. In obesity, insulin-stimulated blood flow to skeletal muscle is limited and this attenuate glucose uptake, thus contributing to impaired glucose homeostasis. However, the mechanism by which insulin-induced vasodilation becomes impaired is largely unknown. The proposed study will test the hypothesis that endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress mediates the impairment in insulin-stimulated vasodilation in skeletal muscle arterioles. It is reasoned that vascular ER stress and vascular insulin resistance caused by obesity is attributable to the local secretion of inflammatory cytokines by perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT). Using a well-established pig model of Western diet-induced obesity, Aim 1 will test if obesity-associated vascular ER stress underlies the imbalance between nitric oxide and endothlein-1 leading to impaired insulin- stimulated vasodilation. Aim 2 will then determine if obese skeletal muscle PVAT can cause vascular ER stress, thus contributing to impaired insulin-stimulated vasodilation. Finally, Aim 3 will examine whether in vivo genetic and chemical enhancement of ER function can restore impaired insulin-stimulated vasodilation associated with obesity. The contribution of this proposed work in pigs is significant as targeting ER stress may be a novel therapeutic strategy to correct vascular insulin resistance and ultimately prevent/treat metabolic and cardiovascular disease fueled by obesity. The University of Missouri (MU) campus has a distinguished history of research in cardiovascular science, metabolism, and exercise physiology and is the home for the Life Sciences Center, the Dalton Cardiovascular Research Center, the Health Activity Center, the Diabetes and Cardiovascular Center, the National Swine Resource & Research Center as resources for this project. These centers are filled with faculty from multiple departments and divisions that actively collaborate, providing an unparalleled research environment to pursue my independent research. Indeed, I will be interacting with a large number of senior investigators who will not only help ensure successful completion of the proposed studies, but also facilitate my career development as I progress toward becoming a successful independent investigator. James R. Sowers, MD, will be my primary mentor and Frank W. Booth, PhD will act as my co-mentor. Dr. Sowers is a clinical physician as well as a researcher with expertise in vascular insulin actions and cardiometabolic disease. Dr. Booth has expertise in adipose tissue biology and physical activity. Together, we have assembled a comprehensive research training plan and team of collaborators that will facilitate the acquisition of new molecular techniques (i.e., in vivo adenoviral transfection, proteomics) as well as techniques involving in vitro preparations of isolated intact arterioles to enhance my abilities to conduct mechanistic research. These additional skills combined with my earlier background in human vascular research will contribute to my long-term goal of establishing a research program with capabilities to conduct in vitro and in vivo mechanistic and translational research using animal models of obesity/type 2 diabetes as well as human patients. In short, the additional technical, academic, and career development afforded by my training plan will place me in an ideal position to successfully launch a productive, independent and translational research program. This NIH K01 application represents the next logical step in my career development as a young early investigator and will set the stage for my first R01 application. (End of Abstract)"
"9390973","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The ?2 allele in the APOE gene, encoding the apolipoprotein E2 (apoE2) isoform is a risk factor, independent of cholesterol levels, for peripheral vascular diseases including carotid atherosclerosis, cerebrovascular disease and ischemia of lower extremity arteries in humans. The ?2 allele is also associated with higher body mass index and type 2 diabetes. This project integrates these gene association studies with the goal of identifying the mechanisms by which apoE2 promotes obesity and related peripheral vascular diseases. The overall hypothesis is that apoE2 increases the risk of peripheral vascular diseases by two distinct but synergistic mechanisms: First, defective hepatic clearance of apoE2-containing triglyceride-rich lipoproteins increases lipid partitioning to extrahepatic tissue, most notably the adipose tissues to increase adiposity; and second, apoE2 expression in adipocytes and macrophages each contribute uniquely through different mechanisms to cause robust adipose tissue inflammation that synergizes with hyperlipidemia to promote atherosclerosis. Our recent studies revealed that, in comparison to human APOE3 gene replacement mice, the APOE2 mice are more susceptible to diet- induced obesity and their adipose tissues are more inflamed with increased number of dead adipocytes. The apoE2-expressing adipocytes and macrophages are also dysfunctional with impairments suggestive of a contributory role toward inflammation and atherosclerosis. Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that defective hepatic clearance of apoE2-containing triglyceride-rich lipoproteins favors plasma lipid re-distribution to other tissues including adipose tissue, thereby increasing obesity and accelerating adipose tissue remodeling that leads to tissue dysfunction and inflammation. In Aim 2, adipose tissues from APOE2 and APOE3 mice containing the isoforms only in adipocytes will be reciprocally transplanted into recipient mice to test the hypothesis that apoE2 expression in adipocytes destabilizes lipid droplets and favors lipolysis, thereby synergizing with hyperlipidemia to promote lipotoxicity that leads to adipocyte death and adipose tissue inflammation. In Aim 3, reciprocal bone marrow transplants will be performed between APOE2 and APOE3 mice to test the hypothesis that macrophage- specific apoE2 oligomerization impairs macrophage functions, which also synergizes with hyperlipidemia in contributing to the robust adipose tissue inflammation observed in obese APOE2 mice. Aim 4 represents the culmination of the three mechanistic studies by performing perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) transplants to carotid arteries of APOE2 and APOE3 mice to test the hypothesis that apoE2-induced PVAT dysfunction and inflammation provides periadventitial outside-in signals that act synergistically with elevated apoE2-induced hyperlipidemia to promote carotid atherosclerosis. Insights gained from these studies will allow for translation to human patients with direct impact on intervention strategies for ~10% of the population that are ?2 carriers. Since peripheral vascular disease is a common manifestation of atherosclerosis affecting ~30 million individuals, understanding how increased PVAT inflammation impacts atherosclerosis will also be valuable."

"9473179","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The biliary epithelium is a complex network of interconnected ducts that increase in diameter from small to large bile ducts. It has been proposed that small cholangiocytes contain a population of biliary committed progenitors, showing expression of various biliary progenitor markers, and incorporate into neo-bile ducts at the sites of injury. When large cholangiocytes are damaged, small, Ca2+-dependent cholangiocytes are activated, acquiring phenotypic and functional features of large cholangiocytes and resulting in the repopulation of the injured large bile ducts. Cholestatic liver diseases (CLDs) such as Primary Biliary Cirrhosis (PBC) and Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis (PSC), are chronic diseases that slowly damage the intrahepatic and extrahepatic bile ducts including both small and large bile ducts. During CLDs and other human diseases, extracellular vesicles (EVs) are released by almost all cells (including hepatobiliary progenitors and cholangiocytes) in resting and activated conditions. Their mechanisms of actions are being elucidated and their potential role in health and disease is drawing increasing attention. However, the specific roles of non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) in cholangiocytes derived EVs during hepatobiliary tissue repair (especially their characteristics during cholestatic liver injury) still need to be addressed. Based on our compelling data, we propose the central hypothesis that ncRNAs in small cholangiocytes derived extracellular vesicles contribute to the recovery of cholestatic liver injury through induction of growth and anti- senescence/anti-inflammation of hepatobiliary tissues and cells. In this application, we propose the systematic evaluation of stemness dependent ncRNAs as markers in small cholangiocytes derived EVs with the therapeutic potentials for cholestatic liver injury. We will address our central hypothesis by focusing on the following specific aims: 1) To define the biliary extracellular vesicle associated ncRNAs signaling involved in anti-inflammation process in hepatobiliary cells. In this study, we will characterize the interactions between miR-125b/let-7 and uc.338/uc.189 family members; define the role of anti-LPS ncRNA signaling in small cholangiocytes derived extracellular vesicles through flow cytometry and real-time PCR analysis. 2) To determine the effects of SMCC-EV associated ncRNAs on accelerating the morphologic and functional recovery of cholestatic liver injury in CLD mice induced in vivo by BDL or in the genetic mouse model of PSC and PBC, Mdr2-/- and dnTGFbRII, respectively. Therapeutic effects of EVs derived from SMCCs with miRNAs or inhibition of T-UCRs on hepatobiliary cell proliferation and inflammation, senescence and fibrosis will be evaluated. The results of the proposed studies may lead to new therapeutic strategies for human cholestatic liver diseases. Meanwhile, the acquired fundamental new knowledge about regulation of growth and tissue repair during cholestatic liver damage by hepatobiliary progenitors derived EVs is expected to advance the general field of anti-inflammatory biology and emerging therapeutic opportunities."
"9393692","PROJECT SUMMARY The scientific premise of the Wake Forest Translational Alcohol Research Center (WF-TARC) is that the neurobiological substrates that contribute to alcohol use disorder (AUD) vulnerability and resilience are not fully understood. Despite the fact that alcohol misuse contributes to 88,000 deaths in America each year, the effectiveness of currently available interventions is less than desirable and is demonstrated by relapse occurring in up to 70% of treated patients. It is clear that we must better understand the neurobiology of AUD vulnerability so that patients can be identified early in the disease process and appropriate novel treatments can be developed. There is a growingly accepted three-stage model of addiction that is based on a recurring cycle of binge/intoxication, followed by withdrawal/negative affect, and ultimately preoccupation/anticipation of further use (craving). This project will focus on craving as a potential marker for AUD vulnerability as it is the primary predictor of AUD relapse. The first aim is designed to characterize the behavioral phenotypes and brain network properties associated with high craving in moderate-high alcohol drinkers (females 1-3 drinks/day, males 2-4 drinks/day). Participants must drink most days of the week but cannot have any history of, or currently meet criteria for, AUD. Ecological momentary assessment (EMA) methods utilizing iPhone technology will be used to assess craving during real time and in the participant's natural environment during normal drinking days, as well as during abstinence. Functional neuroimaging and brain network analyses will be used to examine associations between craving and brain connectivity. It is hypothesized that 1) individuals with high Alcohol Craving Experience (ACE) scores will have higher measures of EMA craving, and 2) the high ACE population will have high levels of connectivity between medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and posterior default-mode network (DMN) and low levels of efficiency between the mPFC and the ventral striatum and amygdala. Aims 2 and 3 will evaluate the effects of randomization to mindfulness meditation intervention versus a sham mindfulness intervention on the behavioral and brain characteristics associated with high craving in moderate-high alcohol drinkers. This will be the first placebo-controlled mindfulness meditation study to examine the behavioral and neural mechanisms supporting alcohol craving. It is hypothesized that mindfulness meditation will not only significantly reduce EMA measures of craving, but will decrease connectivity between the mPFC and posterior DMN and increase connectivity from the mPFC to the ventral striatum and amygdala. This project has the potential to guide the development of future clinical trials to better target clinical outcomes by understanding corresponding mechanisms supporting meditation-related reductions in alcohol craving. The identification of behavioral markers underlying craving as an indicator of vulnerability could lead to real-world interventions to prevent AUD."

"9390496","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by a distinct deposition of an abnormal form of the tau protein in a pattern that is unique from other diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). CTE has been found most often in professional contact sport athletes (e.g., boxing, football) who have been subjected to repetitive blows to the head resulting in concussive and subconcussive trauma. Neuropathologically-confirmed CTE has been reported in individuals as young as 17 and in athletes who only played sports through high school or college. It also has been found in non-athletes who experienced repetitive head impacts, including epileptics, victims of physical abuse, and military service members. In contrast to what may be inferred by the extensive media attention on CTE, the science of CTE remains in its infancy; critical questions remain, such as whether or not it is a common disease. Although the neuropathological features of CTE have become further clarified in recent years, the clinical presentation of CTE is still not well characterized, even though there have been case reports in the literature of dementia pugilistica in boxers since the early 1900's. Clinical diagnostic criteria have only recently been published and lack validation. Neuroimaging and fluid biomarkers developed for the diagnosis of other neurodegenerative diseases have only been used in preliminary studies. There is thus an urgent need to develop accurate methods for detecting and diagnosing CTE during life so that effective interventions for prevention and treatment can be developed. Moreover, though a history of repetitive head impacts is a necessary risk factor for CTE, it alone is not sufficient. There is a need to understand what specific aspects of the head impact exposure places an individual at increased risk for CTE and to examine potential genetic modifiers of that risk. To address these needs, we propose a multidisciplinary, multicenter, longitudinal study of former athletes with high exposure to repetitive head impacts (120 former NFL players with and without symptoms) or medium exposure to repetitive head impact (60 former college football players with and without symptoms) and a control group of 60 asymptomatic same-age men without any history of repetitive head impact exposure or traumatic brain injury. The aims of our proposal are: (1) to collect and analyze neuroimaging and fluid biomarkers for the detection of CTE during life, including the use of a novel PET tracer to measure the amount of abnormal brain tau; (2) to characterize the clinical presentation of CTE; (3) to examine the progression of CTE over a three year period; (4) to refine and validate diagnostic criteria for the clinical diagnosisof CTE; (5) to investigate genetic and head impact exposure risk factors for CTE; and (6) to share project data with researchers across the country and abroad in order to expedite growth in our understanding and treatment of this disease."
"9424390","Project Summary/Abstract The long-term objective of this proposal is to understand the molecular-level mechanism of metabolic flux regulation in human cells. In this proposal, we will investigate the subcellular localization-function relationship of human multienyzme metabolic complex that regulate glucose metabolism in human cells. Despite considerable advances in our knowledge of glycolytic enzymes and their complexes, it is still challenging to explain how the direction of glucose flux is spatially and/or temporally regulated at metabolic nodes between energy metabolism and anabolic biosynthetic pathways. Now, we provide compelling evidence that all the cytosolic, rate-determining enzymes in glucose metabolism are spatially organized into a multienzyme complex, namely the ?glucosome,? in various sizes in the cytoplasm of human cells. We hypothesize that the spatial assembly of glucosomes regulates the direction of glucose flux in a size-dependent manner at subcellular levels. In Aim1, we will determine a precise metabolic function of each size of glucosome clusters at subcellular levels, thus providing a quantitative principle for their collective metabolic outcomes at ensemble levels. Quantitative secondary ion mass spectrometric imaging and 13C-metabolic flux assays will be performed to determine size-specific partition coefficients of glucosome clusters as their metabolic functions. In Aim 2, we will provide mechanistic insights of how multiple metabolic pathways are reciprocally regulated as a network to govern metabolic shunts at subcellular levels. Intracellular fluorescence resonance energy transfer microscopy and in vitro immunoprecipitation will be used to map the network of protein-protein interactions and its alterations in differently sized clusters. In Aim 3, we will address how glucosome clusters are spatially altered to functionally contribute to the cell cycle progression. Flow cytometry, time-lapse fluorescence live-cell imaging, cell synchronization and mass spectrometry will be employed to functionally correlate the sizes of glucosome clusters with the cell cycle. We envision that metabolic activities of the rate-determining enzymes in glucose metabolism are spatially regulated inside glucosome clusters to govern the direction of glucose flux in cells. The proposed research will significantly advance our understanding of glucose flux regulation at subcellular levels and thus its dysregulation in human metabolic diseases, like cancer and diabetes. Collectively, this new level of understanding will divulge the importance of a heretofore unrecognized metabolic compartment as a novel target for therapeutic intervention."
"9395664","Project Summary Interventions designed to delay or prevent Alzheimer's disease (AD) are more likely to be effective if delivered early in the course of the disease before clinical symptoms emerge. To identify individuals who are in the pre- symptomatic or preclinical phase of AD the processes underlying early pathogenesis must be better understood. Recently developed tau-specific positron emission tomography (PET) tracers are allowing researchers to shed light on this critical neuropathology, which previously could only be examined post-mortem or by proxy measures from a spinal tap. Braak staging, a framework for staging tau pathology in post-mortem tissue based on density and topology of tau, may now be used to stage tau pathology in vivo. The current proposal is designed to elucidate the temporal dynamics of AD pathology, especially tau, and associated functional connectivity changes in cognitively healthy older adults. Specifically, longitudinal PET imaging of both beta-amyloid and tau along with task-free functional MRI will be used to 1) characterize the extent and spread of tau pathology using in vivo Braak staging, 2) examine the effect of tau pathology in Braak regions on local functional coherence and 3) determine how tau pathology in medial temporal lobe (MTL) affects functional connectivity to the retrosplenial cortex, which is anatomically connected (mono-synaptic) to MTL and essential to normal memory function. The relationship of tau pathology, functional connectivity changes and early changes in memory function will also be explored. The progression and severity of tau pathology are associated with disease severity (cognition) across the mild cognitive impairment (MCI)-dementia spectrum. It is critical, therefore, to elucidate the temporal dynamics of tau progression in aging and to examine possible mechanisms underlying the link between tau and cognitive decline. In this proposal both local and distant functional connectivity will be explored to better understand the downstream effects of tau on brain function. The Braak staging framework, which was originally derived from cross-sectional data, is an essential component of neuropathological diagnosis of AD. The current proposal will apply a recently developed in vivo Braak staging approach to longitudinal data for the first time. Findings from the studies described here will be novel and high impact. Furthermore, the outcomes of this proposal will contribute to efforts to differentiate normal aging from pathological aging-related trajectories. The accurate identification of individuals with preclinical AD will be critical to effective delivery and assessment of early intervention approaches. 1"
"9397577","PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT The recognition that inflammation has important roles in the pathogenesis of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) arises from evidence that autoimmune and infectious diseases are associated with the development of PAH; inflammation can generate experimental pulmonary hypertension (PH); and perivascular inflammation is present in the pathology of human PAH and animal models of PH. However, whether inflammation is causal, an amplifier of alternative triggering mechanisms, or an epiphenomenon remains unclear. Prior studies on the role of T cells in disease pathogenesis have generated data of unclear relevance to PAH: Th2 and Th17 cells are detrimental in Aspergillus-exposed and chronically hypoxic mice, respectively, while regulatory T cells (Tregs) are protective in rats treated with SU5416 or monocrotaline. The translational application of these data is hampered by limited inflammation in the chronic hypoxia model and unclear mechanisms linking inflammation to vascular remodeling. We propose to interrogate a model system with a relevant antigen that activates specific Type 2 immunity; a perivascular compartment in which there is antigen uptake and presentation, cell proliferation and recruitment; and molecular mechanisms involving TGF-?1 resulting in pulmonary artery remodeling. We employ a mouse model triggered by the parasite Schistosoma mansoni, which reproduces key phenotypes of likely the most common cause of PAH worldwide. Our proposal seeks to identify the precise role of antigen- specific CD4 T cells as the source of IL-4 and IL-13; how this population arises, expands, and is activated; and its impact on monocyte recruitment and TGF-? activation. We hypothesize that exposure to Schistosoma egg antigens results in clonogenic Th2 CD4 T cell activation and proliferation, leading to production of IL-4 and IL-13; this prototypic Th2 response recruits Ly6C+ monocytes causing TGF-?-driven PH. Our overall goals are to determine the molecular mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of Schistosoma-PH; identify approaches to develop immunotherapies, such as vaccination, against this parasitic disease; and to more broadly identify novel therapeutic targets in the inflammatory cascade, which may also be applicable to other inflammation-driven PAH etiologies. Specific Aim 1 is to determine that T cell IL-4 and IL-13-driven inflammation caused by Schistosoma leads to TGF-? activation and PH. In this Aim we will investigate the necessity and sufficiency of Th2-activated CD4 T cells in Schistosoma-PH using a systematic series of experiments with deficient mice and immune reconstitution, to precisely determine whether CD4-derived IL-4/IL- 13 is critical for Ly6C+ monocyte recruitment and the overproduction of active TGF-?1 which results in PH. Specific Aim 2 is to determine the Schistosoma antigen(s) taken up by antigen presenting cells that activate pathogenic, clonogenic IL-4/IL-13 producing CD4 T cells in Schistosoma-PH. In this Aim we will identify specific pathogenic Schistosoma antigens; the cells taking up, processing and presenting Schistosoma antigens to activate CD4 T cells; and the CD4 T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire indicative of clonal selection."
"9392592","The key challenge addressed in this proposal is to develop a means to harness the power of molecular biology to define therapeutic targets for brain disease. This treatment-oriented approach combines the urgency of a practicing neurologist with the knowledge and technology modern science brings to neuroscience. From the basic science perspective, understanding the fundamental root mechanism of disease is an uncompromising goal. From the neurologist's perspective, the perfect cannot be the enemy of the good, leading to five basic points:  Success to date in the treatment of brain disease offers a key lesson in focus. Treatments target accessible molecules, and this will dictate how we focus big data analysis.  Human neurologic disease is complicated. The best model system for understanding neurologic disorders is the human; studies of human brain material must be integral to developing new treatments.  Regardless of the cause of brain disease?and current neuroscience is appropriately  focused on tracing ?genetic? (DNA) etiologies?the manifestations of such defects are  mediated by the stoichiometry, distribution and variability of cell-specific RNA regulation and  its consequent effects on proteins within affected cells.  Different cell types contribute to different brain disorders, but the difference between individual cells of any one type is unknown. The differences between them are manifest at the level of RNA, not DNA.  The quantity, quality (isoforms) and distribution of targets (e.g., receptors) are enormous.  The unique spectrum of diversity of an individual cell type?neurons, astrocytes or microglial cells?is unknown, more so when comparing diseased and normal brain. Using a variety of new strategies, we will study RNA regulation in individual cell types.  Bridging these points together requires new methods and computational approaches.  The net result of contrasting RNA regulation in individual human cell types in health and disease will uncover otherwise hidden cell type-specific targets for therapeutics."
"9391031","Summary During different behavioral states, such as quiescence versus vigilance, neural circuits are set into distinct operating modes and respond to afferent inputs, such as sensory stimulation, in very different ways. In other words, neural circuits are rapidly configured into appropriate information processing modes demanded by behavioral states. The first question this project addresses is, what are the operating modes of sensorimotor circuits during different behavioral states and how are they set? During exploratory behaviors, animals move their body (head, limbs, and trunk) and adjust the position of the sensors (eyes, fingers, pinnae, whiskers) used to explore the environment. During these states, the brain must disambiguate the neural activity that causes the movements from the activity that is driven by the movement and its interaction with the environment. The second question this project addresses is, how does the brain differentiate motor from sensory activities during active exploration of the environment? As animals explore the environment, detection of an unexpected stimulus leads to an orienting response by which animals move to evaluate the stimulus. Repeated presentation of the stimulus without significant consequences leads to habitation of the orienting response, and the stimulus is eventually ignored. The third question this project addresses is, what neural circuits drive orienting responses and how does habituation occur at a neural level? These questions will be investigated using a combination of methods that include electrophysiology, optogenetics, DREADDs, pharmacology, and histology applied using a variety of approaches ranging from acute slices of brain tissue to freely behaving rodents conducting behavioral tasks. We will take advantage of readily available Cre driver lines that allow to control the activity of specific neuronal populations and test their role in behavior. The neural and behavioral processes we study are normal, but when they go awry they lead to neurological disorders. Deciphering the normal operating modes of neural circuits is essential to understand how these operations are impacted by neurological disorders."
"9397567","Myofibroblast activation of Valvular Interstitial Cells (VICs) is considered to be a primary driver of valvular fibrosis and stenosis. For this reason, the external cues that act to control the myofibroblast phenotype of VICs have been topics of considerable attention in the field. Increasing evidence suggests that beyond receptor-mediated activation of VICs by soluble growth factors, physical cues from the matrix play a critical role in this process. Unfortunately, traditional methods used to culture VICs inherently leads to their myofibroblast activation, such that it becomes difficult to determine the effects of environmental stiffness on activation and especially de-activation. To address this issue, our group has demonstrated that unique hydrogel materials can be used to create soft, non-activating substrates for VIC culture that allow VICs to maintain a phenotype that more closely resembles that of freshly isolated cells. Now, we aim to examine how matrix stiffness in combination with pro-inflammatory cytokines influence the VIC fibroblast-to- myofibroblast transition, the epigenetic changes that may occur to these cells over time, and the pathways in matrix signaling that might be useful in reversing the pathogenic myofibroblast phenotype. Specifically, we propose to: 1) Use a combinatorial approach to study the effect of pro-inflammatory cytokines on VIC phenotypes as a function of microenvironmental stiffness 2) Identify the effects of mechanical and inflammatory cues on the fibroblast-to-myofibroblast transition and its reversal using hydrogels with dynamically tunable mechanical properties, and 3) Discover new molecular targets for therapeutics to temper pathogenic VIC myofibroblast activation under inflammatory conditions. Together, work completed within each of these Aims will provide unique insight into the progression of fibrotic aortic valvular stenosis. The creation of tunable cell culture platforms will allow us to answer questions about differences between reversible (transient, wound healing state) and irreversible (persistent, pathogenic state) VIC myofibroblasts that cannot be adequately addressed with traditional methods. Subsequent analysis of the signaling pathways and genes will be used to identify new targets with therapeutic potential to reverse VIC activation and treat valve disease. Moreover, successful completion of these Aims should be of general interest to the field of medicine, as mechanisms of fibrosis are likely shared among most fibrosis-related diseases."
"9404484","PROJECT SUMMARY: While tremendous progress has been made to understand the roles of epithelial pro- genitors in tissue repair and fibrotic mechanisms, little is known about the origin, nature of interaction and gene regulatory programs of fibroblast progenitors. Pulmonary research has been challenged by the remarkable complexity and diversity of fibroblast populations and mesenchymal stem cell populations. Our long-term goal is to understand the complexity of fibroblast populations and to identify their regulatory role on the epithelium during alveolarization and epithelial repair. Our primary objective is to identify key regulators of fibroblast dif- ferentiation in the lung. The present application is based on our preliminary data that identifies GATA6 as a key transcription factor in matrix iReFs, which are indispensable for alveolarization. Our central hypothesis is that GATA6 regulates gene expression in iReFs that sub sequentially induce matrix iReF specification and para- crine interactions with AECs during development and repair. The rationale for the proposed research is that understanding the regulation of fibroblast subpopulations, and their distinct roles in epithelial-mesenchymal cell interactions, will provide new answers for fundamental questions regarding lung homeostasis and repair.  This hypothesis will be tested with three specific aims: 1) that matrix iReFs instruct AEC1 differentiation. 2) that GATA6 transcriptionally regulates a set of matrix fibroblast signature genes and 3) that H3K27me silencing marks regulate GATA6 and matrix gene expression in aged iReFs. In the first aim, alveolosphere cultures will be used to interrogate the epithelial-mesenchymal crosstalk between specific iRef subpopulations and wild type alveolar epithelial cells. In the second aim, gain and loss of function studies of GATA6 will be used to es- tablish a functional link between fibroblast phenotype and alveolarization. In the third aim, H3K27me3 histone marks will be assessed by ChIP-PCR analysis. In vivo and in vitro studies using EZH2 inhibitors will determine a role of EZH2 in suppressing matrix fibroblast signature genes. These studies will provide a better under- standing of the impact of fibroblast diversity on epithelial-mesenchymal crosstalk during alveolarization and alveolar regeneration. This contribution will be significant because it will advance the knowledge about genes and pathways involved in alveolar regeneration, give new insights into the cause of decreased regrowth with age and provide the basis for new therapies to overcome current limitations of regeneration in the human lung. Our understanding of the role of lung fibroblasts in lung injury and regeneration lags far behind our understand- ing of the role of epithelial cells. New information about interstitial lung fibroblasts will be invaluable for defining mechanisms of development, normal lung repair, and lung disease."

"9441844","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Research Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a systemic inflammatory disorder affecting approximately 1.3 million people in the United States. Interstitial lung disease (ILD) is a common lung complication of RA with increasing prevalence and mortality. Although RA-associated ILD is similar to other types of lung fibrosis, which are well known to have increased respiratory symptoms and functional decrements, little is known about the characteristics and natural history of RA-associated ILD. Some studies have suggested that there is a spectrum of RA-associated ILD with approximately 10% of RA patients having advanced disease, and another 30% with early disease, half of whom will progress. Early ILD in smokers has been associated with mildly increased respiratory symptoms, reduced total lung capacity, and functional decrements; however these findings have not been well characterized in an RA population. It has also been shown that the addition of peripheral blood molecular markers to such clinical parameters may enhance the assessment and prognostication of individuals with fibrotic lung diseases.  In this career development proposal, the applicant hypothesizes that RA-associated ILD will be associated with a spectrum of radiologic changes, functional decrements, respiratory symptoms, and peripheral blood molecular markers. She proposes to create a clinical prediction score from these functional and molecular characteristics to improve the identification of subjects with both early and advanced disease. Specifically, in her first aim, she will explore the relationship between early and advance RA-associated ILD with respect to functional decrements, as measured by lung function testing and the distance walked in six minutes, and respiratory symptoms. In her second aim, she will identify peripheral blood molecular markers that are associated with RA-associated ILD, and correlate those markers with the degree of functional impairment. In her third aim, she will build a clinical prediction score and validate this score in an independent cohort. To achieve the aims of this proposal, a cohort of well-characterized RA patients with early and advanced ILD will be developed, providing an invaluable resource for future longitudinal studies.  The successful completion of this research will provide us with novel non-invasive ways to identify those at risk for RA-associated ILD as well as a better understanding of the characteristics and natural history of RA- associated ILD. This will enable closer monitoring and earlier treatment of affected individuals, potentially leading to decreased morbidity and mortality in individuals afflicted with RA-associated ILD. Candidate The applicant's long-term career goal is to become an independent clinical/translational NIH funded investigator focused on patient-oriented pulmonary research. In order to achieve this goal, her short-term career objectives are to acquire the clinical research, quantitative, and analytical skills necessary to complete the proposed research and become an independent patient-oriented researcher. Additionally the applicant will obtain the clinical and scientific expertise and publication record necessary to define herself as an authority in the field of interstitial lung disease (ILD) in individuals with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). This will be accomplished through a career development plan that integrates formal didactics, including advanced epidemiology, biostatistics, biomarker, and programming courses, with conference attendance, clinical activities, and the guidance and support of her multidisciplinary team of mentors, advisors, and collaborators. The unique combination of skills and scientific knowledge gained through her research experience and career development plan and their application to the field of RA-associated ILD will help her to establish independence from her mentorship team and prepare her to achieve her long-term career goal. Environment The applicant will perform her proposed research and career development / training activities at a world- renowned major academic institution. The division in which she will work is a rich research environment with an outstanding history of mentorship, academic leadership, and intellectual interaction. This institution is very invested in the applicant's successful career development, including making available all the facilities, resources, and equipment necessary for her career enhancement and the research proposed in her application. In addition, she will have full access to a robust and well-characterized cohort o rheumatoid arthritis subjects, as well as collaborative arrangements with multiple local and national institutions.

"9390764","ABSTRACT  . In particular, the The phenomenon of molecular changes to the lymphatic endothelial cells and the biological role(s) of the lymphatic vasculature in the metastatic cascade of human cancer are not entirely understood syndrome of in-transit melanoma is a fascinating clinical example of disease presentation in search of a pathophysiological basis. In our recent paper, Ligand-directed targeting of lymphatic vessels uncovers mechanistic insights in melanoma metastasis (Christianson et al. PNAS, 2015), we performed ex vivo combinatorial screens using random peptide phage libraries of draining lymphatic channels removed directly from patients during melanoma excision surgeries. We discovered a functional ligand-receptor system by selecting, isolating, and validating a new homophilic protein-protein interaction between malignant melanoma cells and lymphatic endothelial cells. This unique and previously unrecognized finding provides the foundation for the development and optimization of a new platform for ligand-directed imaging of the lymphatic system. Here, we propose to interrogate previously identified peptide ligands that bind to the surface of the lymphatic endothelium during disease progression to develop a novel, ligand-directed, non-invasive in vivo lymphatic imaging platform. Specifically, our goals are to: (1) Use innovative chem- and bio-informatics data mining systems to define the ontology of enriched lymphatic vessel homing peptides, (2) Investigate the binding properties of selected peptide ligands and their corresponding receptors in vitro, and (3) Develop and implement targeted imaging systems to study the lymphatic endothelium. Peptides that home to PPP2R1A, a new powerful lymphatic marker, will be prioritized. Our long-term goal, subsequent to the completion of the work proposed here, is to discover new lymphatic biomarkers associated with disease progression and generate a panel of ligand-based imaging agents that specifically target the surface of the lymphatic endothelium for prognostic and diagnostic translational applications. We anticipate that the newly characterized lymphatic molecular addresses and validated, corresponding ligands and antibodies will be of great value for the development of targeted agents, establishing for the first time, a platform for non-invasive imaging of the lymphatic system, and, in the future, contribute to our understanding of the role by the lymphatic vasculature in human disease."
"9553400","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Chemokines are small secreted proteins that induce chemotaxis in various cell types. This proposal focuses on CCL28, one of the most widely expressed mucosal chemokines. CCL28 is strongly expressed in the salivary gland and it therefore normally coats the digestive tract. It is also expressed by mucosal epithelial cells, exhibits antimicrobial activity, and its expression is induced in the mammary gland upon the onset of lactation. Its receptor is GPR2/CCR10, and a Ccr10-/- mouse cannot recruit IgA plasmablasts to the mammary gland. In the gut, CCL28 expression is induced in colonocytes in response to pro-inflammatory cytokines, suggesting that it could play an important role in colitis. CCL28 is therefore a Dual (homeostatic/inflammatory) chemokine. In this proposal, we have studied the phenotype of a Ccl28-/- mouse. Importantly, our preliminary data indicates that the Ccl28-/- mouse is extremely sensitive to infection with the enteric pathogen Salmonella enterica serotype Typhimurium. Salmonella enterica is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Serotype Typhimurium is one the most common isolates of Salmonella, causing inflammatory diarrhea in immunocompetent patients but also bacteremia in immunocompromised individuals. The main objective of our proposal is to study the mechanism through which CCL28 plays a role against infection with mucosal pathogens like S. Typhimurium. Our central hypothesis is that CCL28 plays a critical role in the protective response to S. Typhimurium infection, either through the recruitment of specific subsets of immune cells, or through direct antimicrobial activity. Our hypothesis is based on preliminary data indicating that a Ccl28-/- mouse shows dramatic mortality and increased bacterial load in lymphoid tissues following infection with S. Typhimurium. Accordingly, we will test our hypothesis through the following Specific Aims: In Specific Aim 1, we will confirm that CCL28 plays a protective role during S. Typhimurium infection, and will obtain more data on the conditions under which this susceptibility is observed. In Specific Aim 2, we will investigate the mechanism through which CCL28 exerts a protective effect during infection. We hypothesize that it can be due to a failure (in the Ccl28-/- mouse) to recruit certain leukocyte populations critical for controlling Salmonella infection, or alternatively, because the antimicrobial activityof Ccl28 is an important factor in natural resistance against Salmonella. To address these possibilities, we will analyze the leukocyte populations in the gut of Ccl28-/- mice compared to wild-type littermates. We will also study the potential susceptibility of a Ccr10-/- mouse to Salmonella infection. Successful implementation of this study will open a new field of research, namely, the role of CCL28 in the control of bacterial infections and host-pathogen interactions."
"9418116","PROJECT SUMMARY Schizophrenia (SCZ) is a profoundly disabling neurodevelopmental disorder causing marked functional impairment. SCZ is hypothesized to arise from synaptic disturbances affecting large-scale neural connectivity along cortico?thalamic- striatal?cortical (CTSC) pathways. Neuroimaging evidence supports this view by showing alterations in associative cortices and connectivity disruptions across CTSC circuits in chronic SCZ. Yet, the complex evolving neurobiology of early-course SCZ remains uncharacterized. This limits treatments for early illness phases when intervention is crucial by capitalizing on the narrow `window' of opportunity to halt disease progression. Thus, understanding the neurobiology of early-course SCZ is a major objective for early detection, prognosis prediction and targeted individualized therapy. A major complicating factor in many SCZ studies is the confounding presence of antipsychotic treatment. Thus, our goal is to characterize co-occurring functional and structural dysconnectivity in unmedicated early-course SCZ and quantify neural changes in relation to cardinal SCZ symptoms, cognitive deficits and treatment response. To achieve this, we will examine longitudinal progression of neural dysconnectivity in 150 unmedicated early-course SCZ patients after their initial admission into clinics affiliated with West China Hospital. We will follow patients longitudinally at 6, 12, and 24 months later in comparison with 150 matched healthy controls. We will use state-of-the-art functional and structural methods optimized by the Human Connectome Project to achieve cutting-edge multi-modal neuroimaging integration. As noted, mounting evidence implicates CTSC loops in SCZ, particularly higher-order prefrontal and thalamic regions (e.g. medio-dorsal structures), suggesting mechanistic links between CTSC dysfunction and SCZ symptoms. Thus, first we aim to test if the identified CTSC markers exhibit concurrent (or dissociable) structural and functional alterations in unmedicated SCZ patients and if these circuits alter longitudinally. Second, we will test if structural and functional neuroimaging alterations relate to severity of cardinal SCZ symptoms and cognitive deficits. This provides a much-needed mapping between longitudinal CTSC dysconnectivity, symptoms and cognition in SCZ. Critically, this balanced longitudinal design can distinguish `state' versus `trait' neuroimaging markers during early illness course in relation to clinically relevant variables. Finally, it is well established that many SCZ patients do not respond well to antipsychotics. Yet, the neural markers of poor treatment response remain unmapped (and conversely treatment response). A key advantage of the proposed U.S.-China partnership is precisely the capacity to longitudinally study large sample sizes starting from medication-free observations, afforded by extensive and robust recruitment infrastructure at West China Hospital. Thus, our third aim is to quantify longitudinal structural and functional CTSC dysconnectivity in relation to treatment response. Collectively, this study will map longitudinal `state' versus `trait' neural markers starting from medication-free early illness stages (Aim 1), relate these changes to symptom dynamics (Aim 2) and treatment response (Aim 3). This mapping is vital to inform future work aimed at maximizing individualized early intervention strategies."
"9448457","Summary  In the heart, as in cancer, metabolism provides energy and building blocks for the cell. James Watson (of The Double Helix fame) recently pronounced that in cancer, targeting metabolism may be a more promising approach to treatment than targeting transforming genes. At a time when cellular regeneration receives much attention, the intracellular dynamics of metabolism must be considered as well. In earlier work supported by this grant, we identified two metabolic signals serving as regulators of protein turnover in the heart: a low [ATP] / [AMP] ratio as regulator for protein degradation, and glucose 6-phosphate as regulator of the mTOR growth signaling pathway. We learned that in the heart, like in cancer cells, a phenomenon known as the Warburg Effect drives metabolic rearrangements which are linked to enable cell growth. Perhaps even more importantly, we learned that the oncometabolite D-2-hydroxyglutarate impairs cardiac function by inhibiting a Krebs cycle enzyme. Our overall objective is now to solidify the concept of a link between cancer cell metabolism, and cardiac cell metabolism, cardiac structure, and cardiac function independently from any chemotherapeutic agents or pharmacological interventions. Specific Aim 1 will define the role of oncometabolic signals as regulators of cardiac remodeling. Specific Aim 2 will define the role of reductive carboxylation as a mediator for metabolic structural and functional remodeling of the heart using the oncometabolite D-2-hydroxyglutarate as a model. Specific Aim 3 will extend the findings to address specific structural, proteomic and epigenetic mechanisms of remodeling in the metabolically deregulated state of D-2- hydroxyglutarate. In summary, as we continue our work on the intracellular self-renewal of the cardiomyocyte, we expect to identify new regulatory proteins and enzymes that drive adaptation to metabolic stress in the heart. Our long-term goal is to develop a platform for new metabolic strategies to support the failing human heart by integrating specific, dynamic aspects of cancer cell metabolism with heart metabolism. In short, metabolic systems do not exist in isolation and their understanding may be exploited for the treatment of heart failure."

The candidate's long-term career goal is to become an independently funded physician investigator, devoting more than 75% of his time to establish and maintain a clinical research program in IBD. The candidate's short- term career goals are to 1) further characterize the previously built large analytic IBD dataset by the candidate to include information on health-care and non-health care related expenditures; 2) produce the preliminary data and publications necessary for a successful R01 application. This application outlines the institutional commitment, research plan, and key mentors involved to ensure the candidate accomplishes these goals. Previously, the candidate's work has led to development of a truly novel, comprehensive nationwide registry of ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD) patients with linkage to various administrative databases. Leveraging and expanding this resource is the foundation for the current R03 application, which is a natural extension of the candidate's K23. Broader use of biologic agents that target tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF- a) has been associated with a significant rise in cost of health care delivery in UC and CD patients. Although a number of studies have estimated the cost effectiveness of biologics, the long-term impact of these medications on direct and indirect health-care costs particularly in UC is unknown. In this proposal, the candidate seeks to fill this knowledge gap through a comprehensive examination of impact of anti-TNF therapy on direct and indirect health-care costs, including rates of hospitalizations, surgery, work loss, and disability. The specific goals of the study are to 1) assess the impact of anti-TNF therapy on rates of UC-related hospitalizations and surgery; 2) estimate the societal costs of UC both pre- and post- the availability of anti- TNF. The research environment, which includes the MGH Crohn's and Colitis Center and MGH Clinical and Translational Epidemiology Unit will provide a rich, collaborative, and intellectually stimulating atmosphere to ensure the candidate's success. Through this award, the PI will expand his research into the economic analyses for high cost medical interventions, serving as a foundation for future R01 proposals based on comparative effectiveness studies in IBD.

"9392188","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recent studies indicate that alternative splicing plays a major role in regulating gene expression during heart development, however the extent of regulation and the physiological roles for developmental splicing transitions are unknown. Alternative splicing is regulated by RNA binding proteins that bind within the pre- mRNA near the regulated splice site(s) to enhance or repress splicing. This project focuses on the CUGBP, Elav-like family (CELF) of RNA binding proteins that is down-regulated ten-fold during postnatal heart development promoting expression of a subset of protein isoform transitions due to alternative splicing. CELF- regulated targets are enriched for genes that function in endocytosis and vesicular trafficking that we hypothesize reflects a role in postnatal maturation of the cellulr components for excitation contraction coupling (ECC). We will determine the functions of protein isoforms expressed during postnatal cardiomyocyte development using cell culture and existing CELF gain of function lines of mice. We are using postnatal development to identify isoform transitions that have a physiological impact since a high fraction are conserved and like transcriptional programs, splicing programs revert to fetal patterns in heart disease. We will firs use antisense oligonucleotides to redirect splicing of vesicular trafficking genes in two cell line including a large scale screen of redirected splicing to identify protein isoform transitions with physiological impact. We will then use systemic delivery of antisense oligonucleotides targeting a limited set of high priority genes for reversion to fetal splicing patterns in the heart. Of particular interest will be genes that revert to fetal splicing patterns in heart failure. Our goalis to establish correlations between isoform transitions and structure and function of the ECC apparatus. Given the lack of understanding of the normal roles of developmental splicing programs, the knowledge gained from this project will increase our understanding of both normal development and pathogenic mechanisms in congenital and adult heart disease."
"9402112","The Hippo pathway is an evolutionarily conserved signaling mechanism that controls organ size by regulating cellular growth and death. The Hippo pathway exists in the heart and controls apoptosis, autophagy, hypertrophy, and proliferation in cardiomyocytes (CMs). YAP is a transcription co-factor and one of the most prominent terminal effectors of the Hippo pathway. Core kinases in the Hippo pathway, including Mst1 and Lats2, assemble with the help of hWW45, a scaffolding protein, and their activation induces nuclear exit and degradation of YAP, thereby negatively regulating YAP function. YAP controls both proliferation and hypertrophy of CMs and apoptosis in adult CMs, and plays an essential role in maintaining cardiac function and promoting regeneration in the heart subjected to chronic myocardial infarction (MI). Despite the generally detrimental effects of the Hippo pathway and the salutary role of YAP in the heart under stress, cardiac-specific Mst1 and Mst2 double knockout (KO) (Mst1/2cKO) mice and cardiac-specific hWW45 KO (hWW45cKO) mice develop more severe heart failure (HF) than control hearts in response to pressure overload (PO). These mice exhibit de-differentiation and decreased contraction of individual CMs. A fundamental question is why CMs possess the Hippo signaling pathway, if the sole function of the Hippo pathway is to induce cell death. We hypothesize that: Physiological activation of the Hippo pathway plays an essential role in maintaining CM function during PO by inhibiting unopposed activation of TEAD through YAP, at the expense of CM survival. To test this hypothesis, we will first demonstrate the physiological role of the upstream canonical Hippo pathway in the heart during PO and the role of YAP in mediating the detrimental effect of Hippo pathway downregulation. We will use Mst1/2cKO and hWW45cKO mice to demonstrate that the absence of the nuclear Hippo pathway and persistent activation of YAP are detrimental during PO. We will show that the detrimental effect of Mst1/2cKO and hWW45cKO is mediated through activation of YAP, using cardiac-specific heterozygous YAP KO (YAPhcKO) mice. We will then show that unopposed activation of YAP induces de-differentiation of CMs through TEAD1- mediated activation of fetal-type contractile proteins in the presence of PO. We will cross YAP gain-of-function mouse models, including hWW45cKO and YAP transgenic mice, with TEAD1+/- mice and show that persistent activation of YAP in CMs induces de- differentiation of CMs through activation of TEAD1 in the presence of PO. Suppression of the Hippo pathway and activation of YAP have been considered for treatment of HF, whereas the physiological function of the Hippo pathway has never been considered previously. We here propose the novel concept that the heart carries this cell death pathway in order to maintain the differentiation status of CMs. Furthermore, our study will shed light on a group of cardiomyopathies caused by persistent activation of YAP and consequent de- differentiation of CMs, as well as the possible treatment of these diseases with YAP inhibitors."
"9446143","Project Summary Hypertension is the most important risk factor for the development of cardiovascular disease, the leading cause of death in the U.S. Despite therapeutic advancements, nearly 20-30% of hypertensive patients have uncontrolled high blood pressure. This resistant hypertension is associated with elevated sympathetic activity and abnormal baroreflex reflex control and thus is termed neurogenic hypertension. Animal models of neurogenic hypertension consistently implicate augmented release of GABA within the intermediate nucleus of the solitary tract (intNTS) as a contributing pathophysiological mechanism. Correcting this pathophysiological mechanism is a logical step towards decreasing high blood pressure of neurogenic origin. However, GABA and its receptors are poor therapeutic targets because GABA is the predominant inhibitory neurotransmitter in the CNS. To circumvent this impediment we began investigating whether neurons in the intNTS that express angiotensin type 2 receptors (AT2R) may serve as an access point for therapeutic interventions that relieve neurogenic hypertension. Using a novel transgenic mouse model (AT2R-eGFP reporter mouse) we discovered that GABA neurons in the intNTS robustly express AT2R and optogenetic excitation of these neurons significantly increases blood pressure. Intriguingly, DOCA-salt hypertension in mice increased indices of GABA synthesis in the intNTS but central delivery of the AT2R agonist, Compound 21 (C21), abrogated this hypertension and downregulated indices of GABA synthesis in the intNTS. Relevant to the proposed research, the antihypertensive effects of brain AT2R activation were abolished by deleting AT2R from GABA neurons. Based on these results we hypothesize that GABA neurons in the intNTS that express AT2R may be manipulated to reverse the onset of neurogenic hypertension. Two Specific Aims are proposed to substantiate or refute this hypothesis. Aim 1 combines genetic and pharmacological approaches to evaluate the consequences of deleting or stimulating AT2R on GABAergic neurons in the intNTS. Aim 1 tests the hypothesis that activation of AT2R expressed on GABAergic neurons in the intNTS alleviates DOCA-salt hypertension in mice by decreasing GABA synthetic enzymes within these neurons, which consequently decreases sympatho- excitation and improves baroreflex function. Aim 2 utilizes in vitro optogenetic and in vivo chemogenetic approaches to evaluate how DOCA-salt hypertension with or without C21 affects GABA neurotransmission within baroreflex circuits mediating cardiovascular function. Aim 2 tests the hypothesis that the activity of neurons within the intNTS that express AT2R control baroreflex sensitivity and sympathetic outflow and their selective inhibition mediates the reversal of hypertension. Execution of the proposed experiments will identify a discrete population of neurons that can be targeted to control blood pressure and provide preclinical evidence for the development of novel approaches for alleviating resistant hypertension."
"9393832","ABSTRACT The U.S./Mexico border is a unique macro context for drinking, with increased alcohol availability due to the lower minimum legal drinking age in Mexico of 18 years and an increased number of venues for on premise consumption of alcohol (bars, clubs, restaurants). Previous research has shown that the border population is more at risk for unsafe drinking (binge) and drinking-related problems than the population off the border. Mexican Americans are uniquely exposed to this macro environment by virtue of their location in large numbers in cities on the U.S./Mexico border. This component of the Center will use analyses of archival data (e.g., hospital admissions), ethnographic assessments of drinking venues, and survey methods to examine the association between drinking contexts and problem drinking, and associated drinking problems, including DSM-5 alcohol use disorder (AUD) among Mexican American younger adults (18-39 years of age) living in the California/Mexico border area of Imperial City, El Centro, Heber, and Calexico (hereafter border cities). This sample will be compared to a group of age matched Mexican Americans and non-Hispanic Whites who live away from the border, in the cities of Delano, Madera, Tulare, and Visalia, in the Central Valley of California (hereafter Valley cities). The aims and hypotheses to be tested in this Center component are: Aim 1: Archival data for Mexican Americans in the border cities will show a higher rate of alcohol-related hospital discharges, motor vehicle crashes and emergency room admissions; violent crime rates, violent assault rates; drinking and driving arrest, and higher alcohol outlet density, than data for Mexican Americans and Whites in Valley cities; Aim2: Survey data will show that, a) younger Mexican Americans in the border cities will be more likely to drink in public venues such as bars and clubs than at home and with family than age matched Mexican American and Whites in Valley cities; b) patronage of public drinking venues such as bars and clubs among younger Mexican Americans in the border cities will lead to heavier drinking and more frequent binge drinking; c) patronage of public drinking venues such as bars and clubs will also be associated with younger age (18 to 30), male gender, higher income, drinking with friends (as opposed to family or romantic partner), and higher impulsivity, sensation seeking and risk taking; Aim 3: Survey data will also show that, a) rates of alcohol-related social problems (e.g., with family, job, legal, sexual, aggression), as well as DSM-5 AUD, will be higher among Mexican Americans in the border cities than among age matched Mexican Americans and Whites in Valley cities; and b) higher frequency of drinking in on premise outlets and drinking in Mexico (for residents of border cities) will have an independent effect on alcohol-related social problems and DSM-5 AUD; Aim 4: Unobtrusive systematic observations and semi-structured interviews will be conducted in selected bars in the border cities, in the Valley cities and in Mexicali. It is expected that commercial drinking venues in the Mexican border town of Mexicali, BC (across the border from the selected study cities on the U.S. side), will have riskier operating conditions (e.g., more patrons, more dancing, louder music) as well as lower priced alcohol and later closing times compared to venues in the U.S. border towns and Central Valley towns."
"9402634","Transplant arteriosclerosis (TA) is a highly-prevalent complication of heart transplantation where diffuse, irreversible stenoses form in graft coronary arteries. Donor specific antibody (DSA) binding MHC on graft endothelial cells (EC) is a strong risk factor for TA, but the mechanism(s) of how DSA causes TA are not well understood. To study this problem, DSA was modeled on EC using high panel reactive antibody (PRA) sera taken from sensitized transplant candidates. PRA sera deposited DSA on EC and activated complement, a system of immune-related proteins that when activated forms pore-like structures called membrane attack complexes (MAC) on cell surfaces. PRA caused MAC assembly on EC which elicited EC activation and enhanced EC immunogenicity of alloimmune CD4+ T cells. These processes had an overall effect of exacerbating TA lesions in human coronary arteries in a humanized mouse model. MAC mediated these effects through a novel effector pathway involving NF-?B-inducing kinase (NIK), a critical mediator of non-canonical NF-?B signaling. This proposal defines mechanisms of how MAC activates NIK in EC, explores how these mechanisms operate in a humanized mouse model for TA, and uses NIK in patient EC as a platform to develop novel diagnostic tests for TA. The Specific Aims proposed herein are unchanged from the original application. Aim 1A and Aim1C, subaims of Specific Aim 1, where endocytosis of MAC was explored as a mechanism for NIK stabilization in vitro and in vivo, were successfully completed during the K99 phase. In the R00 phase, Aim1B of Specific Aim 1, where MAC+Rab5+ subcellular compartments will be isolated to identify how Akt mediates NIK, will be completed. Additionally, in the R00 phase, Aim 2, which explores clinical correlations between NIK and TA in patient biopsy specimens, will be completed. The positive predictive value of NIK expression in two microvessel EC compartments will be assessed in patient samples, and novel markers correlating with TA will be identified using laser capture and RNA profiling of NIK."
"9418370","Choline is an important and essential nutrient, but there are no good validated biomarkers for assessing choline nutritional status that can be practically applied in clinical or public health practice. Choline is a required nutrient with Adequate Intake (AI) and a Tolerable Upper Limit (UL) levels set by the U.S. Institute of Medicine's Food and Nutrition Board and a Recommended Daily Intake (RDI). Given the narrow range for healthy intake of choline, given the establishment of a RDI of choline to maintain health, given the 3-fold variation in dietary intake in the US, given the effects of common genetic variants on requirements for choline and because plasma choline concentrations do not adequately reflect status, we propose that a panel of laboratory tests be developed and validated that assess choline status in humans. From a larger set of measures, we will identify the biomarker measures that best correlate with measurements of choline pool size using isotope dilution. Healthy volunteers (n=60 males, 60 premenopausal females and 60 postmenopausal females), as outpatients, will consume meals containing 100% of the recommended intake of choline (550 mg choline/day) for 2 weeks, they will then be switched to a diet containing 50% of the recommended intake of choline for 2 weeks, then switched to a diet containing 25% of the recommended intake of choline for 2 weeks, and then switched to a diet containing 10% of the recommended intake of choline (55 mg choline) for 2 weeks. Finally, all subjects will be placed on the 100% choline diet for 2 weeks of choline repletion. On the last 3 days of each diet period, subjects will consume deuterated choline. Plasma and urine samples will be collected for metabolomic assays (biomarker small molecules identified in a previous study as likely to predict choline status), isotopic dilution estimation of choline pool size and we will perform transient elastography of liver to assess liver fat. These studies will be used to determine the optimal set of biomarkers to use in calculating a choline status score that correlates well with choline pool size assessed using isotope dilution. Finally, SNPs in genes of choline and folate metabolism have been associated with increased risk for developing organ dysfunction on a low choline diet. We will test our choline status score by determining whether people with these SNPs have a lower choline pool size/worse choline status score for any given choline dietary intake than do people without these SNPs."
"9388998","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Vision loss and blindness from glaucoma can be prevented. Medications that lower intraocular pressure (IOP) prevent the onset of glaucoma and glaucoma's progression to a debilitating, vision threatening disease. The effectiveness of IOP lowering drops, however, is hindered by topical side effects and toxicity, poor patient adherence, poor bioavailability, and systemic side effects. Only 40% of patients fill the first prescription tey are given. Monitored adherence with eyedrops is less than 75% even under ideal conditions [1]. Given these limitations, it is not surprising that continued worsening of vision status among glaucoma patients continues to an unacceptable degree. Glaucoma treatment could be greatly improved by better drug delivery, specifically an approach that removes the patient from the equation by placing the agent on the eye at the time of doctor visits.  I plan a multi-year period of clinical-scientist training focused on improved drug delivery systems for glaucoma therapy. This training will be carried out with a mentor group of experienced scientists, each bringing expertise in vital areas of my training. The group of senior investigators who have agreed to mentor me already works productively together on multiple NEI---NIH sponsored research grants. Dr. Harry Quigley is principal investigator for the Wilmer K12 program and has 40 years of experience in glaucoma models in animals. My second principal mentor will be Dr. Justin Hanes, who heads the Center for Nanomedicine at Wilmer/Hopkins and has already produced ocular drug delivery systems using biodegradable polymer microparticles for treatment of glaucoma [2]. Using these sustained release formulations, a single dosage of an IOP lowering medication or neuroprotective agent could have an effect that lasts for several months, while overcoming side---effects, toxicity, adherence failure, and inadequate bioavailability. During my present clinical fellowship year at Wilmer in Glaucoma, I have begun pilot research training with Drs. Harry Quigley with Dr. Justin Hanes. In addition, I will benefit from inclusion of 3 other investigators who have agreed to provide specific mentored training in important aspects of my program. Henry Edelhauser, PhD., (Emory University) is a world---expert in drug delivery to the eye. He has agreed to provide expert guidance on drug penetration methodologies. Jie Fu, PhD., is a member of the Center for Nanomedicine at Wilmer/Hopkins, who is expert in controlled drug formulation. She will provide both her formulation skills and training for me to develop these formulations. Dana Ferraris, PhD is a medicinal chemist, who has agreed to advise me in this program.  Although we intend to formulate multiple IOP lowering medications for sustained release, we have chosen the sustained release of dorzolamide as an initial research area for my training, as it illustrates several important aspects of the research problem and has a high probability of practical application. Dorzolamide lowers IOP through action as a topical carbonic anhydrase inhibitor but, in drop form, its efficacy is limited by toxicity and poo patient adherence due to the need for dosing two or three times daily. We hypothesize that these limitations can be overcome by formulating dorzolamide for injection under the conjunctiva or into the eye, in a sustained release delivery system. In Aim 1, we will generate and characterize biodegradable, polymer microparticles for sustained release of dorzolamide to the eye. Once conditions are optimized for sustained release of dorzolamide, additional IOP lowering medications will be formulated for controlled release. Prior to in vivo experiments ex vivo assays using rabbit and human sclera will be performed to evaluate trans---scleral delivery of medication by these formulations. In Aim 2, we will evaluate pharmacokinetics, IOP lowering, and retinal ganglion cell (RGC) protection by dorzolamide microparticle formulations in rabbit and rodent eyes. We will also test efficacy in RGC protection upon injection of a combination of our new controlled release formulation with an existing controlled release neuroprotection formulation recently developed by Hanes in collaboration with Quigley and Zack (2).  I plan a career as a university-based clinician scientist, providing patient care with a major effort in clinical and laboratory research in novel therapeutic approaches to treating glaucoma. To develop the necessary skills and knowledge to conduct competitive research. I propose this multi-year research program with faculty who has expertise in creating controlled release formulations, targeted drug delivery, and animal models of glaucoma."
"9386763","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The epicardium is a single cell-layer mesothelial sheet that surrounds the heart and harbors a multi-potent progenitor cell population. Amazingly, epicardial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) leads to cardiac fibroblast and coronary vessel formation at the precise moment that diffusion fails to fuel the heart. The epicardial fetal gene program is re-awakened in ischemic heart disease and contributes to coronary neoangiogenesis and fibrosis. Surprisingly, none of the currently known regulatory mechanisms explain how EMT occurs in perfect synchrony with physiological demand. Serum response factor (SRF) is a widely expressed transcription factor that controls gene expression programs through interactions with tissue specific or signal responsive co- factors. Embryonic and adult cardiovascular function depends upon interactions between SRF and myocardin, which is specifically expressed in cardiomyocytes and smooth muscle cells, constitutively nuclear, and required for activation of genes encoding contractile proteins. Conversely, myocardin-related transcription factor (MRTF)-A and MRTF-B are broadly expressed, but held dormant in the cytoplasm until physiological signals lead to their nuclear accumulation. MRTF-A and -B promote differentiation of a mesenchymal / myofibroblast cell type in response to a growing list of agonists, including Rho-Rho kinase, TGF-?1, and mechanical tension. Our recently published data reveal a critical role for MRTF-A in myofibroblast differentiation and scar formation following myocardial infarction. Our preliminary studies reveal SRF, MRTF-A and MRTF-B are enriched in the embryonic and adult epicardium and are required for EMT. Further, MRTF/SRF activity is induced by hypoxia and promotes a mesenchymal phenotype in cooperation with Wilms tumor 1 (WT1), including the coordinated regulation of guidance cues (Wnt signaling) and cytoskeletal components. Based on our preliminary data and the work of others, we hypothesize that physiological hypoxia in the epicardium promotes the synergistic interaction between MRTFs, SRF, and WT1 that drives EMT, coronary vessel formation and cardiac fibroblast production during development and disease. We will test this hypothesis with three Specific Aims that will define the molecular mechanisms underlying transcriptional regulation in the epicardium. Aim 1 will determine how MRTFs and SRF control epicardial cell function during development using conditional deletion of these factors and lineage tracing experiments in mice. Aim 2 will determine the transcriptional mechanism governing epicardial cell fate and function by defining the expression signature cooperatively regulated by SRF, MRTFs, and WT1 in the epicardium, and identify the physiological cues that modulate this gene regulatory axis. Aim 3 will define the role of MRTF-SRF in epicardial derived cell differentiation and cardiac function following myocardial infarction. These studies will test a paradigm-shifting hypothesis that explains the coordinated regulation of epicardial cell migration and differentiation by physiological cues and reveal novel therapeutic targets for the treatment of ischemic heart disease."

Research Center Grant at the Prevention Research Center (PRC) will perform organizing and administrative functions for the entire center, supporting the infrastructure critical to the goals and aims of PRC for the period from December 1, 2017 through November 30, 2022. The Core has coordinating responsibility over all Center Grant research components as well as other funded research projects not a part of the Center Grant. Ensuring and maintaining scientific standards and raising public awareness are primary functions of the Core. Core responsibilities are both internal (supporting PRC) and external (supporting alcohol prevention in general). Greater detail of the Administrative Core is provided in the sections that follow. Major internal functions of the Core specifically related to the Center Grant include: Executive Function, Administrative Support, Computer/Statistical Support, and the Research Reference function. The administrative time of the Principal Investigator and Scientific Director (Dr. Paul J. Gruenewald), the Associate Director (Dr. Mallie J. Paschall), a Geographic Information Systems (GIS) specialist (Mr. Andrew Gaidus) and an econometric and Bayesian spatial analyst (Mr. William Ponicki) serving all research components of the Center, and financial support for meetings of the six members of the Scientific Advisory Council are directly supported by the Core. Prevention Research Center, and its parent organization, Pacific Institute for Research and Evaluation, provide indirect support for information technology services, facilities management, and recruitment of personnel, and computer/statistical support functions: word processing, graphic design capability, and additional database management. The Research Reference function includes maintenance of the alcohol prevention library. Alcohol prevention is multi-disciplinary, so the Center cannot function in isolation. PRC staff are involved in a range of activities designed to create scientific bases for public discussions about alcohol issues and to contribute to awareness and rational public debate. Therefore, the major external functions of the Core support participation in scientific and professional meetings, conference sponsorship, consultation, participation in advisory groups, expert panels or direct technical assistance, providing testimony, research review, editorial review, professional associations, and training."
"9434836","Abstract The emergence of multi-drug resistant Gram-negative pathogens (especially Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, and the Enterobacteriaceae) is among the most serious challenges faced by infectious disease clinicians today. Many of these resistant pathogens now possess extended spectrum ?-lactamases (ESBL) and carbapenemases, seriously limiting treatment options and increasingly producing clinical failures. Our long-term goal is to develop carbapenemase inhibitors from entirely novel chemotypes and for which resistance mechanisms are absent from microbial genomes. This focus on reversible, non-natural product based chemotypes is a key feature of our discovery approach, and one we have validated previously for the cephalosporinase CTX-M. Here we propose the use of Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) methods to screen a total of ~6,000 fragments from UCSF and University of Dundee across representative Class A, B, and D carbapenemases (KPC-2, NDM-1, OXA-48) and representative ESBL that we have studied previously, CTX-M. We will further use SPR to validate fragment hits by determining Kd, kon, koff, and binding stoichiometry. Active site binding will then be assessed by competition SPR experiments with known active-site ligands. Finally, binding of validated fragments in the presence of saturating concentrations of specific, well-characterized fragments will be used to identify fragment pairs that bind the active site simultaneously and non-competitively. Individual fragments and the fragment pairs identified in this screening campaign will then be structurally characterized (X-ray) bound to multiple carbapenemases, greatly enabling future medicinal chemistry efforts to covert these fragments to leads (outside scope of this application). Three important innovations will result from the proposed project. First, the rich set of SPR and X-ray binding will be compared to blinded computational docking predictions for the same fragments, leading to improved docking methods for fragment screening. Second, the SPR binding data across diverse beta-lactamases will be used to test our outstanding hypothesis that carbapenemases are more ?druggable? on account of more exposed hydrophobic surfaces in the active site (as compared to ESBLs and narrow spectrum ?-lactamases). Finally, the X-ray structures of fragments bound to Class A, B and D enzymes, including ternary complexes of bound fragment pairs, will reveal consensus binding hot spots shared by diverse carbapenemases, informing a cogent approach to produce novel ?-lactamase inhibitors with a clinically desirable cross-class spectrum."
"9360005","Loud noise exposure experienced during military service results in the two most common service-related disabilities faced by Veterans ? tinnitus and hearing loss. Recent animal studies indicate noise exposure can result in significant loss of auditory nerve synapses. Additional studies suggest that synaptic loss may be associated with tinnitus and hyperacusis. However, synaptic loss can exist even when auditory thresholds are normal, making it difficult to detect. Since clinical audiometric testing is not sensitive to this ?hidden hearing loss?, we currently have no method of testing people for this type of auditory damage. This indicates that there is a critical need to identify individuals suffering from noise-induced cochlear synaptic degeneration and the related perceptual deficits. The long-term goal is to develop strategies for prevention, monitoring and treatment of hidden hearing loss in the Veteran population. The overall objective for this CDA-2 application is to identify physiological markers of hidden hearing loss. The central hypothesis is that individuals with a significant history of noise exposure will show physiological differences in the auditory nerve, brainstem, and cortex when compared to individuals with less noise exposure and that these differences will be associated with hyperacusis and tinnitus. This hypothesis is based on preliminary data and the research literature. Preliminary data shows differences in the amplitude of wave I of the auditory brainstem response (a measure of the synchronous firing of the auditory nerve) between individuals with differing levels of noise exposure. The research literature suggests that noise exposure and tinnitus/hyperacusis may be associated with additional changes in auditory physiology. The rationale that underlies this proposal is that identification of physiological markers of hidden hearing loss and the resulting perceptual changes will facilitate the development of methods for preventing or treating this condition. This hypothesis will be tested by pursuing the following four specific aims: 1) Identify envelope following response (a measure of the brainstem's ability to phase-lock to the envelope of a stimulus) abnormalities present in Veterans with normal pure tone thresholds and high levels of noise exposure; 2) Identify elements of the middle and late latency responses (auditory evoked potentials generated by the cortex) that differentiate noise-exposed Veterans with normal auditory thresholds from individuals with less noise exposure; 3) Evaluate Veterans with high noise exposure and normal pure tone thresholds for differences in contralateral suppression of distortion product otoacoustic emissions (a measure of the strength of the medial olivocochlear efferent feedback pathway); and 4) Investigate the relationship between hyperacusis and tinnitus and the physiological measures described in aims 1-3. The physiological measures described above will be compared across three groups: Veterans with a history of exposure to high levels of noise, Veterans with less exposure, and non-Veterans with limited noise exposure. To minimize the effects of age and hair cell loss, only young subjects with normal pure tone thresholds will be included. This approach is innovative because it investigates noise-related changes to auditory physiological measures in Veterans, a unique population of individuals with significant noise exposure history. This contribution will be significant because it will identify metrics to detect hidden hearing loss, providing the basis for a clinical test battery that can be used to aid in the prevention and treatment of cochlear synaptic degeneration in the Veteran population."
"9593540","Achieving a better understanding of the pathogenesis of Down syndrome (DS; trisomy 21) is important for improving the quality of life of people with DS and for understanding major phenotypes, including intellectual disability, autoimmunity, cardiac defects, Alzheimer?s disease, and cancer susceptibility and resistance, which are prominent in DS and are also highly relevant to the general population. Recently we carried out epigenetic profiling, focusing on DNA methylation, in grey matter and purified neurons and glial cells from autopsy brains, as well as T-lymphocytes, from individuals with DS vs. matched normal controls. We found highly recurrent DS-specific differences in methylation patterns (DS-DM), and observed tissue-specificity of the DS-DM, onset of the altered methylation patterns at the fetal stage, and altered mRNA expression (DS-DE) of only a subset of the affected genes. We found that CpGs in specific classes of transcription factor binding sites (TFBS) were preferentially affected, implicating altered TFBS occupancy as a mechanism in shaping the patterns of DS-DM. Additionally, we carried out whole genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) on brains from mouse models of DS, compared to wild-type littermates, and found alterations in methylation patterns that significantly paralleled those in the human brains. Motivated by these findings, we now seek to answer three questions ? all using well-controlled mouse models of DS carrying chromosomal triplications. First, to understand the molecular consequences of DS-DM we will identify DM genes in the mouse models and determine which of them have differential mRNA expression. We will address this question in purified cell types: T cells and GABAergic neurons. Second, we will test two hypotheses for the trans-acting mechanisms of DS-DM: (i) the abnormal methylation is due to over-expression of methylation pathway genes, including Dnmt3l and others, in the triplicated chromosome regions, and/or (ii) the abnormal patterns of methylation are shaped by overexpression of specific TF genes in the triplicated regions, leading to altered TFBS occupancy followed by altered CpG methylation in and around these sites. We will transfer segmental deletions and/or knockout alleles of individual genes into the DS mouse models to normalize gene dosage, and use WGBS and phenotyping to ask whether specific components of the DM and specific phenotypes are affected, respectively, in the offspring carrying the compound mutations. Third, we will apply state-of-the-art genomic assays to ask whether chromatin architecture within the cell nucleus is altered by the presence of the extra genetic material, and whether this alteration in turn affects DNA methylation, gene expression and phenotypes. Success of our project will identify effector and target genes for DS-DM and unravel the mechanisms underlying DS-DM. We expect that these data will significantly improve our understanding of DS pathogenesis and have broad implications for trans-acting genetic epigenetic interactions in other human developmental and neoplastic disorders that are associated with chromosomal aneuploidies."
"9449697","Asthma is disease manifested by chronic inflammation exacerbated by environmental insults such as allergens, infectious agents and irritants and affects 5-10% of the population. Interleukin 13 (IL-13) signaling is amplified in asthma and plays a central role in the pathogenesis of the disease. Our preliminary data strongly implicate the novel role of surfactant protein A (SP-A) in regulating IL-13 signaling in asthma. The mature SP-A protein is a large hetero-oligomer encoded by SP-A1 and SP-A2 genes. We have shown that SP-A isolated from asthmatic subjects is defective in abrogating inflammatory responses in human airway epithelial cells. This SP-A dysfunction could arise from genetic variation within the SP-A repertoire. Our preliminary studies demonstrate that a synthesized 10-mer SP-A2 223Q peptide, derived from one major allele of SP-A2, has activity similar to the full-length oligomeric SP-A in attenuating the biological responses to IL-13 in primary human epithelial cells and in mouse models of allergic airways disease. Taken together, these preliminary data led us to propose the novel hypothesis that a specific 10 AA sequence within the carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD) of SP-A confers the ability to significantly suppresses allergic inflammation. In our two specific aims, we will determine optimal formulations and dosing schedules for inhaled delivery of SP-A peptides to achieve therapeutic effects in mouse models of allergic airways disease. We will utilize FDA-approved human inhaler devices, FDA-approved excipients to deliver this novel SP-A peptide formulation in vivo via inhalation. Experiments will be conducted under FDA/USP conditions using required in vitro tests specified by the FDA/USP. In addition, in vitro 2D cell culture (i.e. liquid-covered culture and air-interface culture mimicking the air-liquid lung interface), in vitro 3D cell culture (i.e. air-interface culture), and in vivo pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics studies will be conducted. These studies will evaluate mechanisms influencing cell viability as a function of drug dose, particle-cellular membrane interactions, particle cellular uptake, membrane permeability, and drug cellular transport. SPA peptides and lung surfactant interactions will be examined with interfacial film studies. Finally, we will evaluate the efficacy of this novel SP-A peptide formulation and delivery method in a house dust mite model of allergic airways disease in mice. If successful, the proposed preclinical development studies would lay the foundation for subsequent clinical trials for patients with asthma."
"9391020","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): PDZ domains are ~90 residue-long protein domains that usually bind the C-termini of their protein targets. PDZ-containing proteins regulate diverse biological systems and frequently have multiple, distinct PDZ domains, thus acting as scaffolds/adaptors simultaneously binding multiple targets. We will study PDZK1 (four PDZ domains, PDZ1-PDZ4) to understand 1) how distinct PDZ domains in multi-PDZ domain proteins collaborate to mediate function, and 2) how a single target (SR-BI) requiring a PDZ protein in one tissue (liver) requires a different PDZ protein in other tissues (e.g., steroidogeni tissue (ST)). PDZK1 is expressed in diverse tissues, and has many targets, e.g., CFTR, prostacyclin receptor, ion channels, and the HDL receptor SR-BI. We will focus on the tissue-specific PDZ domain-mediated regulation of SR-BI, which controls plasma HDL metabolism. SR-BI influences many processes, including platelet & red blood cell structure/function, female fertility, development, synaptic plasticity & cognition, inflammation, deep vein thrombosis, endothelial physiology, infection (e.g., hepatic Hepatitis C Virus entry), and lipoprotein metabolism and associated diseases (e.g., coronary heart disease). In vivo in hepatocytes SR-BI's normal localization, abundance and function, and thus normal HDL metabolism, depend on its productive interaction with PDZK1. Normal PDZK1/SR-BI interaction requires 1) binding of SR-BI's C-terminus to either PDZ1 or PDZ3, 2) the presence of either PDZ2 or PDZ3 and 3) the presence of PDZ4, which in vitro can non-canonically bind directly to inner plasma membrane-like bilayers. PDZK1's localization to the hepatocyte plasma membrane in vivo requires PDZ4 and co-expression of SR-BI. Knock-in mice with a C-terminal deletion in SR-BI suggest a PDZK1 analog is required for SR-BI expression in ST. We will test two hypotheses (I &II): I. PDZK1's regulation of SR-BI requires two- or three-pronged binding in which 1) PDZ4 tethers PDZK1 to the membrane when SR-BI binds to PDZ1 (or PDZ3) and 2) PDZ2 or PDZ3 either binds to other target membrane proteins or plays a structural role. We will perturb PDZK1's PDZ domains individually or within the full-length protein. Perturbations will include targeted mutations or inhibition by small molecules identified using in silico screening and optimized by medicinal chemistry. The mutants & inhibitors will be used in vitro (biochemistry, biophysics) and/or in vivo (cell biology, transgenic and knock-in mice & physiology). Techniques will include analysis of purified proteins (e.g., isothermal titration calorimetry, hydrogen/deuterium exchange mass spectrometry, X-ray crystallography, neutron reflectometry) and histologic and physiologic studies with transgenic and knock-in animals (including analysis of plasma lipids and lipoproteins). Analysis of the PDZK1/SR-BI system will serve as a model for understanding in detail how other multi-PDZ proteins regulate the important biological functions of cell surface receptors. II. A PDZK1 analog(s) in ST regulates SR-BI protein expression and function (as does PDZK1 in the liver). We will isolate the analog(s) and determine the mechanism of its regulation of SR-BI."
"9444928","ABSTRACT Infection with Zika virus (ZIKV), first linked with an increased incidence of microcephaly in Brazil, is now associated with a spectrum of fetal and postnatal malformations and developmental disorders. Our previous studies with rhesus macaques have demonstrated that, like the human population, severe fetal outcomes are uncommon, but they have also revealed that vertical transmission of ZIKV to the fetus may more common than is currently appreciated, with 100% transmission to fetuses when dams were inoculated in the first or third trimester. Additional neurological deficits from intrauterine infection are now becoming revealed in postnatal life, thus a better understanding of the correlates of vertical transmission at the maternal-fetal interface is critical. Investigators at the University of Wisconsin-Madison are funded to conduct a study to define the viral persistence and distribution in maternal tissues of pregnant rhesus macaques at staged intervals following infection with ZIKV. That study specifically will evaluate maternal tissues, but does not support concurrent evaluation of the maternal-fetal interface. We hypothesize that the antiviral response in the decidua and placenta can determine the risk for vertical transmission of the virus and the degree of fetal pathology and developmental dysregulation. To address this hypothesis, we propose to comprehensively define the immune response at the maternal-fetal interface in these pregnancies in two Specific Aims: Specific Aim 1. To define the T cell, antigen-presenting cell, and innate lymphoid/natural killer cell populations in control and ZIKV-infected decidua, establishing their transcriptional, secreted, and cell-surface profiles with high-dimensional flow cytometry and dimension reduction methodologies. Specific Aim 2. To define the Hofbauer cell surface, secreted, and activation profiles in control and ZIKV- infected placentas. We will use high-dimensional flow cytometric analytical methods established in our laboratories for human decidual leukocytes, guided by our previous work with rhesus decidual leukocytes and placental Hofbauer cells, comparing infected pregnancies with control pregnancies to be supported by this R21 proposal. The ZIKV- infected decidual and placental immunome will be interpreted in light of the distribution, burden, and pathogenic impact of ZIKV replication in the decidua and the fetus. A clearer understanding of the decidual and placental immune response with ZIKV infection, which we can couple with determination of fetal infection and pathology to be gained from the current study, will allow insight into the correlates of decidual and placental immune responses of fetal outcomes."

"9445330","The central objective of this project is to evaluate how PDGF/PDGFR signaling, inflammatory signaling responses modulate the functional outcomes of resident cardiac mesenchymal stem cells (cMSCs) in failing hearts. Ischemic myocardial injury initiates a cascade of two self-amplifying events that intend to promote tissue repair. The initial events are mediated by the concerted action of infiltrating pro-inflammatory immune cells. Although, reparative initially, prolonged infiltration of activated monocyte/macrophage populations within the injured myocardium further exaggerate inflammatory responses and delay the manifestation of wound healing. Chronically these processes induce extracellular-matrix (ECM) remodeling by activating proliferation of collagen producing myofibroblasts. Although multipotent in nature, MSCs often differentiate into myofibroblasts in vivo in a number of pathologies, suggesting that tissue microenvironment influences are paramount in guiding MSC fate. The precise role of cMSCs in the etiology and progression of ischemic HF is unknown. More importantly, factors regulating cMSC function and differentiation in the failing hearts are not clearly understood. During both acute myocardial infarction (MI) and chronic heart failure (HF), there is increased abundance of pro-inflammatory cardiac macrophages. More importantly, macrophage expansion in chronic HF is accompanied by sustained activation of myofibroblasts that promote cardiac fibrosis. Platelet derived growth factor (PDGF) is a well-recognized mediator of tissue fibrosis and angiogenesis. Like macrophages, MSCs secrete PDGF and express PDGF receptors (PDGFRs), resulting in a PDGF-rich and PDGF-responsive microenvironment in the failing heart. Importantly, however, whether cMSC-localized PDGF signaling, in response to such factors as chronic inflammation and macrophage infiltration, regulates cMSC fate and responses in HF is unknown. In this proposal we will test the hypothesis that augmented cMSC-localized PDGF signaling preferentially channels cMSCs toward a myofibroblast fate (and away from an endothelial cell fate) in the failing heart, thereby augmenting fibrosis and reducing angiogenesis and repair. Three aims are being proposed. Aim 1 will define the role of PDGFR signaling and macrophage interactions on the in vitro differentiation fate of cMSCs derived from normal and failing hearts. Aim 2 will determine the in vivo role of cMSC-localized PDGFRs on LV remodeling and function during ischemic HF. These studies will use transgenic mice with inducible and cMSC-specific ablation of PDGFRs. Aim 3 will establish the therapeutic efficacy of cMSC cell therapy after reperfused-MI when used in combination with PDGFR inhibition in vivo. These studies will use the clinically approved PDGFR inhibitor imatinib mesylate (Gleevac). Collectively the proposed studies will answer critical questions relevant to HF related to both the pathophysiological import of altered cMSC fate in myocardial fibrosis, and the potential therapeutic use of cMSCs and pharmacological PDGFR inhibition to induce tissue repair. !"
"9394824","Cerebral cortical development is a highly orchestrated process, with production of neurons destined for the cortical layers produced in order, deep to superficial, followed by glial generation. The timing of this process is very different between species. For example, mouse corticogenesis occurs over approximately a week of gestation, while in humans the process takes several months, resulting in a much larger and more complex cortex. Lineage studies have functionally defined the major types of neural progenitor cells (NPCs) contributing to corticogenesis, including stem cell-like radial glial cells (RGCs) and intermediate progenitor cells (IPCs). However, much remains to be discovered regarding how RGCs and IPCs are specified over time. We have discovered that during asymmetric RGC-IPC cell divisions, the RNA binding protein Stau2 segregates a complex cargo of coding and non-coding RNA specifically into the IPC daughter. Analysis of this cargo at different embryonic stages by RNA-sequencing has revealed networks of genes that are candidates for controlling proliferation and temporal specification of the IPC fate. Here we propose to test these candidates in functional studies, using high-throughput automated time-lapse image analysis for in vitro studies, as well as a novel lentiviral in vivo screening method, to define their roles in specifying IPCs and timing corticogenesis. In contrast to the progress made in understanding the characteristics of mouse cortical progenitor cells, less is understood regarding human cortical progenitors. Fundamental knowledge about how human RGCs and IPCs produce diverse progeny over time, their division mode, cell cycle times and lineages, remains unknown. Here we will address these gaps in knowledge using long-term time-lapse lineage analysis in vitro. In addition, by identifying genes expressed in human cortical progenitor cells, including at the single cell level and via analysis of the Stau2 cargo, we will reveal human cortical progenitor subtypes and heterogeneity. Further, a comparison of human and mouse cortical progenitor cell data will help illuminate key differences to address a major mystery: the difference in timing of mouse and human cortical development. Our lab continues to explore the interaction of environmental factors on cortical progenitor cells, aided by the ability to rapidly quantify changes in proliferation, division mode and differentiation using time-lapse analysis. Soluble factors released by structures in the germinal niche such as vascular endothelial cells and the choroid plexus, act on cortical progenitors to regulate the numbers and types of progeny they produce. Our recent work has identified a panel of candidate niche molecules secreted by the choroid plexus that could interact with receptors expressed on neural progenitors, which we propose to examine in vitro and in vivo, in mouse and human. Defining niche factors and their specific actions paves the way to address diseases that involve degeneration of stem cell zones which are normally active throughout life. Furthermore, defining environmental factors that act on human NPCs is important for translation towards regenerative therapy development."
"9423049","PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT The ultimate goal of islet transplantation is to achieve tolerance defined as long-tem engraftment without maintenance immunosuppression. Several studies suggest that certain extracellular vesicles (exosomes) play an essential role in the immune responses involved in both rejection and tolerance of allogeneic transplants. Recently, we reported that, after pancreatic islet transplantation in mice, many recipient cells, take up donor vesicles and present allogeneic MHC molecules on their surface (allo-MHC cross-dressing); a process leading to activation of alloreactive T cells in vivo. In addition, exosomes released by pancreatic insulin-secreting beta cells are known to promote inflammation and diabetes through transfer of auto-antigens and RNA. Altogether, this suggests that exosomes might play a key role in the rejection of islet allografts. Supporting this view, we have obtained preliminary evidence that in vivo blocking of donor exosome production with 2 agents, GW4869 and cambinol, inhibited allo-MHC cross-dressing and prolonged survival of heart allografts in mice (up to 80 days). Most relevant to this proposal, we have obtained preliminary data showing that treatment of allogeneic islets in vitro (pre-injection) with these GW4869 suppressed donor MHC cross-dressing and nearly abrogated activation of alloreactive T cells in mice recipient of these islets. Contrasting with their role in rejection, exosomes have also been shown to promote immune tolerance. For instance, exosomes derived from FoxP3+ regulatory T cells (Treg-exosomes) suppress inflammation and can mediate immune tolerance of auto- and allo-antigens in rodents. On the other hand, to our knowledge, the tolerogenicity of exosomes produced by regulatory B cells (Breg-exosomes) has never been investigated. Our objectives are: 1) to investigate the nature of the cells and antigens involved in donor exosome release and cross-dressing after islet transplantation and, 2) test whether long-term islet allograft survival could be achieved through inhibition of donor exosome production and/or MHC cross-dressing or via recipient administration with tolerogenic exosomes. Aim 1. Investigate the mechanisms involved in donor antigen cross-dressing of recipient cells after islet transplantation Aim 2. Inhibit donor exosome release and cross-dressing in islet-transplanted mice Aim 3. Achieve long-term islet allograft survival using exosomes derived from regulatory cells We anticipate that our proposal will 1) bring new insights into the mechanisms underlying the initiation of alloimmunity and rejection process after pancreatic islet transplantation and, 2) set the path for the design of novel exosome-based tolerance protocols in islet transplantation and potentially autoimmune and other inflammatory immunological disorders."
"9468977","Heart failure (HF) is a major health epidemic in the developed countries; however, the underlying molecular mechanisms for this disorder are not well characterized. Sirtuins (SIRT) are proteins that exhibit deacetylation or ADP-ribosyltransferase activity and regulate a wide range of cellular processes. There are seven SIRTs in mammalian cells that reside in the nucleus, mitochondria or cytoplasm, and modify certain proteins in their respective cellular compartments. Nuclear and mitochondrial SIRTs are known to contribute to cardiac protection, but the role of SIRT2 (the only sirtuin that resides predominantly in the cytoplasm) in the heart is not known. We are addressing this fundamental gap in knowledge, and our strong preliminary data indicate that the levels of SIRT2 are increased in failing human and mouse hearts. Furthermore, the hearts of mice with global deletion of Sirt2 (Sirt2-/-) display improved cardiac function after ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) and pressure overload (PO). Thus, SIRT2 may have detrimental effects in the heart under stress conditions, which makes this protein a unique member of the SIRT family. Furthermore, our mechanistic studies suggest that SIRT2 modulates cellular levels and activity of nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (NRF2), a transcription factor that induces the expression of antioxidant proteins. Finally, using mass spectrometry and site-directed mutagenesis, we have identified specific lysine residues in NRF2 that are targeted by SIRT2. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that SIRT2 exerts detrimental effects in the heart through deacetylation of NRF2, resulting in a reduction in its protein levels and transcriptional activity, thereby decreasing the expression of antioxidant proteins. In Aim 1, we will determine whether SIRT2 exerts deleterious effects in the heart in response to injury, and whether the protection noted in Sirt2-/- mice is due to systemic or cardiac-specific deletion of Sirt2. We will subject cardiac specific Sirt2 knockout (cs-Sirt2-/-) mice and mice with overexpression of SIRT2 to PO and will assess cardiac function, as well as reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels using novel fluorescence markers. In Aim 2, we will study whether SIRT2 regulates NRF2 abundance and gene transcriptional activity by deacetylating specific lysine residues within its DNA-binding and ubiquitination domains. We will assess total and nuclear NRF2 levels, and its ubiquitination and transcriptional activity in the hearts of cs-Sirt2-/- mice at baseline and after PO and in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) with Sirt2 knockdown. We will also measure NRF2 total and nuclear levels and transcriptional activity with overexpression of NRF2 mutant constructs with mutation of SIRT2-targetd lysines to acetylated- or deacetylated-mimetic residues. In Aim 3, we will determine whether the deleterious effects of SIRT2 in response to injury are mediated through NRF2. cs-Sirt2-/- and cs- Sirt2-/-/Nrf2-/- mice will be subjected to PO, followed by assessment of cardiac function and ROS levels. We will also express NRF2 constructs with mutations of SIRT2 deacetylation sites in cardiomyocytes and assess cell death and ROS production."
"9389006","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Human idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive, lethal fibrotic lung disease characterized by non-resolving epithelial injury, persistent myofibroblast (MFB) phenotype and stiffening of the extracellular matrix (ECM). Biomechanical signals derived from stiff/fibrotic ECM are emerging as crucial factors that regulate fibrotic lung progression. In recent studies, we have demonstrated that RhoA/Rho kinase (ROCK) mediate matrix stiffness sensing by lung MFBs. Inhibition of RhoA/ROCK mechanosensitive signaling ameliorates experimental lung fibrosis. MFBs isolated from patients with IPF are characterized by an invasive phenotype. It is currently not known whether pathologic ECM-derived biomechanical signaling regulates the invasive phenotype of IPF MFBs. Preliminary studies showed that matrix stiffness regulates IPF MFB invasion into the basement membrane (BM) by a RhoA/ROCK-dependent mechanism. Stiff matrix upregulates gene expression of integrin  alpha 6 (ITGA6), matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9) and urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR), factors associated with BM binding and degradation. Blocking ITGA6-mediated cell adhesion abrogates stiff matrix-dependent MFB invasion into the BM. Stiff matrix promotes ROCK-dependent phosphorylation of c-Fos and c-Jun, components of activator protein (AP-1) transcription factor complex, and selectively increases c-Fos and c-Jun binding to immobilized oligonucleotides containing AP-1-binding elements (TREs). Bioinformatics identified multiple TREs in the promoter regions of ITGA6, MMP9 and uPAR. These findings suggest that stiff matrix-induced RhoA/ROCK mechanosensitive signaling promotes MFB invasion into the BM by AP-1-dependent activation of an invasive gene program involving ITGA6, MMP9 and uPAR. The preliminary studies together with our previous studies suggest that RhoA/ROCK mechanosensitive signaling activates multiple fibrogenic mechanotransduction pathways through which sustained RhoA/ROCK signaling amplifies epithelial injury-induced lung fibrosis. In this project, we hypothesize that stiff matrix- induced RhoA/ROCK mechanosensitive signaling regulates MFB invasion into the BM and promotes persistent/progressive lung fibrosis. Specific aims are to: (1) determine whether c-Fos and c-Jun of AP-1 transcription factor complex mediate RhoA/ROCK mechanosensitive signaling to activate invasive gene program; (2) determine whether ITGA6, MMP9 and/or uPAR mediate RhoA/ROCK mechanosensitive signaling to regulate MFB invasion into the BM; and (3) determine whether sustained RhoA/ROCK mechanosensitive signaling following bleomycin-induced lung injury promotes persistent/progressive lung fibrosis in mice. The proposed study, if proven, will provide novel mechanistic insights into the promulgation of invasive MFB phenotype. It will provide proof-of-concept for pathologic ECM-derived biomechanical signaling in the pathogenesis of persistent/progressive fibrosis. The long-term goal of this project is to understand the biomechanical signal mechanisms of lung fibrosis and identify novel targets for effective anti-fibrotic therapies."
"9457796","Abstract Prostate specific antigen (PSA) screening is an established and useful tool for prostate cancer detection, however, it has no predictive prognostic value at diagnosis. For early diagnosed localized prostate cancer, the major clinical challenge is the treatment decision, in whether a patient should receive invasive intervention or be managed as ?watchful waiting? active surveillance. Consequently, patients with indolent prostate cancer can be unnecessarily over-treated; or conversely, patients with prostate cancer of an aggressive nature may miss out on needed treatment, which ultimately leads to mortality. Therefore, it is an urgent need to develop prognostic biomarkers for localized prostate cancer to guide clinical decision making that is most beneficial to each patient. The objective of this proposal is to address the imminent clinical need by developing and validating a panel of potential prostate cancer prognostic biomarkers. Based on the literature and our compelling preliminary findings, we hypothesize that serum levels of the soluble NKG2D ligand MIC (sMIC) in combination with tumor-associated glycan profiles can provide the predictive biomarker capacity for prostate cancer prognosis. We have assembled large cohorts of prostate cancer tissues and matching serum collected from men diagnosed with localized prostate cancer at the time of prostatectomy. These samples have annotated clinical information including follow up PSA biochemical recurrence (BCR) status. These samples will be used to develop a unique panel of prognostic biomarkers and validate their specificity and sensitivity. Findings will be further validated with independent cohorts of serum samples from clinically-defined prostate cancer patients. There are four Specific Aims: 1) Determine the sensitivity and specificity of tissue MIC and serum sMIC in predicting BCR; 2) Determine the sensitivity and specificity of tissue and serum multi- fucosylated glycan panels in predicting BCR; 3) Determine the prognostic capacity of serum and tissue biomarker panel 4) Validate prognostic capacity of the identified panel of serum biomarkers with independent cohorts of patient samples. The proposed study will be accomplished through a collaborative effort led by a team of well-established investigators."
"9386754","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Many critically ill patients survive their initial episode of acute illness but go on to develop persistent  organ failures necessitating prolonged life support, a syndrome known as chronic critical illness.  Increasingly, patients with chronic critical illness receive care in long---termacute care hospitals (LTACs), specialized facilities for the care of these high---risk, high---cost patients. In our prior work we demonstrated that LTACs play an important role in the care of chronic critical illness, producing similar outcomes at lower costs compared to traditional intensive care units (ICUs). Yet our work also demonstrated wide variation in survival across LTACs, with significant differences in long---term mortality that are not explained by differences in case---mix. This work affirmed the essential position of LTACs in the US health system, but also highlighted a pressing need for research on how to best organize and manage care within LTACs in order to optimize care for patients with chronic critical illness. Analogous care settings such as ICUs and nursing homes have a rich evidence base informing their organization and management, but to date no such data exist for LTACs. In this project we will address this fundamental knowledge gap by identifying the key clinical and organizational factors associated with LTAC performance. Our central hypothesis is that objective clinical and organizational factors will distinguish high performing LTACs from low performing ones. Building off a novel hierarchical risk---adjustment model for measuring LTAC---specific mortality, we will first perform site visits at five US LTACs with the lowest risk---adjusted mortality and five LTACs with highest risk--- adjusted mortality. During these site visits we will conduct in---depth ethnography and semi---structured interviews to identify the clinical and organizational factors associated with positive outcomes.  Second, we will develop and field a quantitative survey of physician and nurse managers at all US LTACs, linking the survey back to patient---level outcomes data and empirically defining LTAC clinical and organizational best practices. By shifting the paradigm of LTAC evaluation away from whether they work to how and where they work best, this project will be the first rigorous examination of the factors that define effective LTACs, as well as effective care for chronic critical illness. Ultimately, these results will provide clinicins, hospital administrators and policy makers with immediate, actionable data about how to use LTACs most effectively and efficiently, leading to improved survival for patients with chronic critical illness."
"9406152","Nicotine is the pharmacologically active/addictive compound in tobacco. As such, the lung serves as an ideal and efficient delivery route for nicotine absorption into the bloodstream where it can then cross the blood brain barrier and induce psychotropic effects on the brain. Recently, with the advent of electronic cigarettes (E- Cigs), people have begun inhaling purified nicotine in a liquid vehicle (typically vegetable glycerin/propylene glycol). While the effects of nicotine on the brain and cardiovascular system are well known, the effects of nicotine on the lung have been less studied. Mucus clearance is a major part of the lung's innate defense system and represents the first point of contact of the body with inhaled nicotine. Perturbations in CFTR- mediated ion transport, which is required for mucus hydration/clearance, or biochemical alterations to mucins impair this system, leaving the lung more prone to mucus accumulation/plugging and viral infections, as evidenced by cystic fibrosis and chronic bronchitis lung disease. Our preliminary data indicate that E-cig users have a drastically altered mucus proteome which is suggestive of immunosuppression. In vitro, we found that nicotine, acting through intracellular Ca2+ (i) dephosphorylated CFTR leading to CFTR inactivation and internalization to the endoplasmic reticulum and (ii) altered mucin rheology by directly interacting with mucins. Furthermore, our data also suggest that the normal ability of the airways to activate CFTR and secrete mucins to generate an ?airway flush? to remove inhaled viruses is impaired following nicotine exposure, which is predicted to lead to a failure to resolve common viral infections such as respiratory syncytial virus. We hypothesize therefore, that nicotine causes an immunosuppressed phenotype that leaves the lung more prone to viral exacerbations. Specifically, we propose that (i) nicotine-induced Ca2+ signaling leads to CFTR dephosphorylation and internalization to the endoplasmic reticulum (ii) altered mucus rheology and (iii) a failure to efficiently resolve viral infections. We shall study this hypothesis with the following specific aims: Aim 1. To test the hypothesis that nicotine, via increases in intracellular Ca2+, causes CFTR dephosphorylation and retrograde transport of CFTR to the ER that leads to ASL dehydration. Aim 2. To assess the impact of nicotine on mucin secretion, mucus/mucin biophysical and barrier properties, including their integrity, polymeric structure, and maturation. Aim 3. To determine the impact of inhaled nicotine on outcomes of respiratory virus infection in vivo."
"9386666","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Semilunar valve (SLV) diseases, including bicuspid aortic valves (BAV), are remarkably common and yet their genetic and developmental origins are poorly understood. Likewise, it remains unclear how disrupted embryonic valve development progresses into overt valve disease. Our long-term goal is to understand how gene regulation drives sequential developmental processes that ultimately produce complex, patterned valves and how these processes go awry in SLV disease. These gene regulatory events require transcription factors to interface with a chromatinized genome, suggesting that chromatin regulators are key components of SLV developmental networks. One important event is an endocardial-to-mesenchymal transformation (EMT) that occurs early in valve development to populate endocardial cushions (ECs), including the proximal outflow tract (pOFT) cushions that contribute tissue to SLVs. Our objectives are to 1) understand how chromatin remodeling integrates with cell signaling during EMT, and 2) determine mechanisms by which disruptions of valve development progress into diseased SLVs. Our central hypothesis is that endocardial Brg1-associated factor (BAF) chromatin remodeling complexes interact with Wnt signaling effectors to promote pOFT EMT. As a result, when endocardial Brg1 is deleted a subtype of OFT mesenchyme is depleted. Without these cells, cusp overgrowth and fusion results in thickened and malpatterned SLVs, including BAV. The rationale for our efforts is that defining chromatin remodeling roles during EMT will shed light on how SLV disease originates. Further, our mouse models of SLV disease will enable an understanding of the cellular and molecular progression of valve disease. Our specific aims are: 1) Determine the molecular networks that the BAF complex interfaces with to direct EMT and 2) Determine mechanisms of SLV disease progression in mice lacking endocardial- lineage Brg1. In pursuit of the first Aim, we will compare cellular and molecular pOFT defects seen in unpublished genetic models disrupting Brg1 and Wnt signaling. We will apply a transformative new TU-tagging technology to define dynamic, endocardial transcriptomes dependent on each pathway. Using new cell culture approaches, we will test biochemical interactions between BAF, Wnt effectors, and chromatin in EC cells. For the second Aim, we will use genetic lineage tracing to determine contributions of EMT-derived cells to distinct SLV regions, define interactions between SLV mesenchyme sub-populations, characterize misexpressed transcripts that may drive SLV disease progression, and describe a new mouse model of adult SLV disease of potential utility in preclinical trials. Our proposed research uses novel technological and paradigmatic approaches to pursue unresolved questions of SLV development and disease. These contributions will be significant as they will shed light on the human genetics of SLV disease and inform regenerative medicine approaches. Our newly identified transcripts associated with a BAV model may represent biomarkers for disease diagnostics or therapeutic targets to prevent congenitally abnormal valves from becoming diseased."

"9462515","Project Summary Regulatory T (Treg) cells play a dominant role in controlling immune responses by the suppression of other effector T cells to prevent excessive reactions to benefit the body. On the other hand, Tregs are recruited to and induced by tumor cells, which results in hampering protective anti-tumor immunity to cause body damage. However, the detailed mechanisms for Treg-mediated immune tolerance are poorly characterized. The E3 ligase component Fbw7 mediates the turnover of multiple proto-oncogenes that are broadly implicated in tumorigenesis such as the T cell acute lymphoma. However, whether Fbw7 signaling is crucial to Treg cell function remains unknown. We initiated this project by generating Foxp3+ Treg cell-specific deletion of Fbw7 in mice. Notably, Fbw7f/f Foxp3-YFPcre mice showed markedly reduced lung metastasis and we also found that an enhanced activation and cytokine production by conventional T cells. In addition, Fbw7 belongs to a family of WD-domain containing E3 ligases with ~26 members, and most of them have not been characterized so far. We hypothesize that the E3 ligase component Fbw7 and its family members play overlapping or redundant roles in immune tolerance by regulating the function of Treg cells. To test this hypothesis, we propose the following two Specific Aims: Specific Aim 1. To study the cellular and molecular mechanisms of Fbw7 in Treg cells, and Specific Aim 2. To study Fbw family members in Treg cells. This exploratory R21 application will allow us to study a novel function of the E3 ligase component Fbw7 and its family members in immune tolerance and anti-tumor immunity. The expected results will significantly advance our knowledge on the basic biology of the ubiquitin system in immune regulation, and on the translational aspect of harnessing Treg cells in immunotherapy."
"9448187","Myocarditis is a rare but potentially devastating inflammatory heart disease characterized by myocardial inflammation. Up to 30% of myocarditis patients go on to develop dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), which is a major cause of heart failure in children and young adults. The proposed project, when completed, will significantly improve the understanding of the immunologic phenomenon leading to myocardial remodeling, fibrosis and heart failure. The time window between the inflammatory phase and development of DCM and heart failure is variable, but usually broad enough to allow secondary preventive treatment if specific targets are found. That knowledge might lead to development of novel diagnostic approaches and targeted treatment to prevent dilated cardiomyopathy. Furthermore, according to our preliminary data, those phenomena might be common to other heart inflammatory diseases like myocardial infarction. We have discovered a novel pathway leading to DCM development in experimental autoimmune myocarditis (EAM) mouse model. IL-17A signaling induces myeloid cytokines, such as Granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), and CCL2 (MCP1) expression from cardiac fibroblasts (CF). GM-CSF then promotes differentiation of cardiac infiltrating monocytes toward Ly6Chi inflammatory monocytes, which promote DCM. The novelty of our approach is the focus on the immune modulatory role of cardiac fibroblasts. We propose that CD45?CD31?CD29+PDGFR?+Sca-1+ CF subset (Sca-1+ CFs) is the main producer of myeloid cytokines in EAM, Coxsackievirus B3-induced viral myocarditis, and myocardial infarction mouse models. Moreover, Sca1+CFs are plastic and able to switch their cytokine profiles based on microenvironments. Furthermore, we detected the same population of CFs expressing GM-CSF in frozen endomyocardial biopsy samples from patients with chronic ischemic cardiomyopathy. Our overall hypothesis is that Sca-1+ cardiac fibroblasts contribute to the disease progression from myocarditis to dilated cardiomyopathy through IL-17A-induced GM-CSF production. First, in Aim 1, we will evaluate whether the specific deletion of IL-17RA on Sca-1+ CFs will protect the mice from DCM. Next, we will block the GM-CSF production in Sca-1+ CFs by Adenoviral-associated vector (AAV)-delivered shRNA, targeting GM-CSF under Sca-1+ CF specific promoter. In Aim 2, we will investigate the plasticity of Sca-1+ CF cytokine profile using CCL2-expressing (mCherry+) cells to trace the cytokine production of the same cell following the Th microenvironment change. Next, we will determine the necessity of NF-?B/NFAT signaling pathway in IL-17A- driven DCM through specific ablation of p65 in Sca-1+ CFs. Finally, in Aim 3, we will examine the human cardiac fibroblasts plasticity and signaling pathways involved in GM-CSF production using human primary cardiac fibroblasts and frozen endomyocardial biopsy samples from myocarditis and cardiomyopathy patients."

"9399682","PROJECT SUMMARY Elevated plasma levels of lipoproteins containing apolipoprotein B (apoB), including low density lipoproteins (LDL) and triglyceride-rich lipoproteins (TRL), are among the most important causal risk factors for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (CVD). Despite major advances, the factors that regulate plasma levels of apoB-containing lipoproteins remain incompletely understood. Furthermore, elevated levels of apoB- containing lipoproteins, particularly TRL, are often associated with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), which is a major cause of end-stage liver disease but of which the pathophysiology remains poorly understood. Unbiased `genome-wide' human genetics studies have identified a genomic 8q24 locus near the gene TRIB1 significantly associated with all major lipid traits (total cholesterol, LDL-C, HDL-C, TG), CVD, and liver enzymes, making TRIB1 of high interest for functional evaluation. In vivo overexpression and loss-of-function mouse studies have confirmed this association. Studies in mice with liver-specific deletion of Trib1 (Trib1_LSKO) have shown that hepatic Trib1 not only regulates plasma lipids in mice, but also hepatic de novo lipogenesis, the latter of which is accomplished via turnover of the transcription factor C/EBP?. Interestingly though, while Trib1_LSKO mice exhibit increased plasma lipids, this appears to be due to a C/EBP?-independent mechanism. Thus the underlying mechanism for hepatic Trib1 regulation of plasma lipids remains unclear. We present evidence suggesting that increased expression of Angptl8 due to the absence of Trib1 may lead to decreased hepatic clearance of apoB-containing lipoprotein particles. We propose to formally test this hypothesis and to identify the downstream effector of Trib1 responsible for the increased Angptl8 expression. Variants in the TRIB1 genomic locus are all significantly associated with CAD in humans, and while the effect of Trib1 on plasma lipid levels is clear, no study to date has tested its implications for atherosclerosis. Additionally, no role for extra-hepatic TRIB1 in atherogenesis has been investigated. Trib1 has been shown to regulate the polarization of macrophages, and thus, the combination of its roles in liver and extrahepatic tissues likely interplay in Trib1's overall contribution to risk for CAD. We will perform a deep phenotypic analysis of atherosclerosis in mice that lack extrahepatic Trib1 (with and without rescue of liver Trib1 expression). Finally, while our mouse ChIP-Seq data indicates a negative feedback loop between Trib1 and C/EBP?, (C/EBP? binds to downstream non-coding regions corresponding to the human GWAS signal), the functional sequence variation linking TRIB1 and lipoprotein metabolism has yet to be identified. We will identify the functional non-coding SNP underlying the TRIB1 GWAS signal though chromatin conformation capture, and we will validate these functional SNPs with reporter assays and in iPS-derived hepatocytes. In addition, through resequencing efforts, we have found multiple coding sequence variants in TRIB1 and have begun functional testing of them. The studies proposed here will increase our understanding of the novel roles TRIB1 plays in lipid metabolism, shed light on another novel regulator of lipid metabolism (ANGPTL8), and create genomics tools allowing for interrogation of human variation in the TRIB1 locus."
"9457750","Project Summary A recent international workshop convened to review the findings from asthma/allergy birth cohorts and identify knowledge gaps and research priorities. In their summary, they conclude that a key research priority need is to better understand the mechanisms of progression to asthma in early childhood. This proposal will help to fill this critical gap in understanding. Thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) is a major epithelial cytokine that and is strongly implicated in the pathogenesis of AD, allergic sensitization, and asthma. Antigen exposure in the skin in the context of TSLP is sufficient to induce AD and airway inflammation in the lung, suggesting that skin-derived TSLP is sufficient to drive the progression of AD to asthma. TSLP single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been associated with allergic sensitization and asthma, as well as AD. Expression of TSLP is increased in AD and disease-associated eQTL in TSLP correlate with TSLP expression. These studies collectively suggest TSLP promotes allergic sensitization and AD in early life and may be an important driver of progression of a subset of early allergic phenotypes to asthma. Despite the increasingly evident role of TSLP in allergic disease, the mechanisms by which TSLP is induced in human skin remain unclear. We recently found that among the known TSLP SNPs, 25% disrupt or create a new CpG site, which is significantly higher than the frequency of CpG- SNPs across the genome, and the prevalence of CpG-SNPs is even higher among TSLP SNPs that have been associated with allergic disorders. We have recently identified candidate enhancers upstream of the TSLP locus that may drive TSLP expression and found that allergic disease-associated TSLP SNPs, including eQTL, reside or are in strong linkage disequilibrium with these candidate enhancers. Based on our preliminary data, we hypothesize that mechanical stress and/or barrier dysfunction are translated to TSLP expression through dedicated enhancers and that genetic variation in the TSLP locus relaxes this regulation resulting in enhanced TSLP expression and clinical progression to asthma. This application will have significant public health impact. Through the proposed aims, we will (1) elucidate the mechanisms by which barrier defects in human epidermal keratinocytes are sensed and translated to TSLP transcription; (2) delineate the impact of known risk and protective alleles on this regulation; (3) determine the utility of genetic and epigenetic variation in the TSLP locus as biomarkers of disease progression to asthma; and (4) provide the foundation for development of new algorithms to accurately predict the development of asthma among preschool aged children."
"9397564","PROJECT SUMMARY Tip60 protein, also known as Tat-interactive protein 60 kD, has been associated with induction of apoptosis, the DNA damage response (DDR), and cell-cycle senescence -- functions that are not mutually exclusive -- in cell-lines and in cancer cells. We have shown that Tip60 is a vital protein in the early embryo, and that it undergoes a curious isoprotein shift as neonatal cardiomyocytes (CMs) enter replicative senescence, an event that was recently shown to be induced by activation of the DDR in these cells. Although the heart is enriched in Tip60 protein, its role in this organ remains unclear. A recent study using cultured neonatal CMs revealed that ischemia increases Tip60 content and consequent apoptosis, effects that were prevented in Tip60- depleted cells. This result is consistent with our previous finding in heterozygous Tip60+/- mice showing that modest reduction of Tip60 protein in the adult heart caused release of CMs from cell-cycle arrest while inhibiting apoptosis. Taken together, these findings suggest that reduction or inactivation of Tip60 should enhance cardioprotection during ischemia, by suppressing CM death and permitting CM regeneration. To test this possibility we have developed an animal model in which Tip60 can be conditionally depleted. Using these mice we are addressing Specific Aims to test the twofold hypothesis that Tip60 is recruited to the telomere during early neonatal stages to induce the DDR and replicative senescence in CMs (Aim 1), and that depletion or inactivation of Tip60 in the adult heart confers cardioprotection from ischemia by inhibiting apoptosis and permitting CM regeneration (Aim 2). Experimentally, the first Aim will determine whether Tip60 becomes associated with the CM telomere at early neonatal stages, and whether its depletion reduces telomere length and disrupts the DDR while extending the window of neonatal CM proliferation. The second Aim will determine whether knockdown or transient inactivation of Tip60 in the ischemic adult heart inhibits apoptosis while permitting CM regeneration. Fulfillment of this hypothesis will advance our understanding of how the post- mitotic differentiated state of CMs is attained, while establishing Tip60 as a cardioprotective target. "
"9472586","Toxoplasma gondii is significant pathogenic eukaryote that causes congenital defects, recurrent ocular infections, and devastating opportunistic infections in humans. Toxoplasma is widely dispersed into various hosts in nature due to the remarkable ability of this parasite to transmit to new hosts and to then successfully navigate acute infection and establish chronic infection in many hosts. Work from several labs has clearly established that Toxoplasma secretes proteins from rhoptry (ROPs) and dense granule (GRAs) organelles and several of these proteins are known to manipulate host cells to disarm innate immunity and confer resistance to host interferon-?. Other ROP and GRA proteins clearly modulate the host immune response, particularly IL- 12 and inflammatory cytokines, but individually do not appear to strongly influence parasite virulence or chronic infection. For example, the secreted GRA15 molecule activates NF-?? in low virulence type II strains and this molecule increases production of host IL-12. While the secreted ROP16 molecule of virulent type I or type III strains sustains the activation of transcription factors STAT3 and STAT6 and reduces host IL-12 production, the low virulence type II ROP16 molecule does not activate STAT3 or STAT6 and was previously hypothesized to be inactive. In preliminary data, we show that individual deletion of low virulence type II GRA15 or ROP16 did not affect acute virulence or chronic infection. Surprisingly, however, we discovered that simultaneous deletion of low virulence type II GRA15 and ROP16 abolished acute virulence as well as the ability to establish a chronic infection. These remarkable phenotypes suggest that type II ROP16 together with GRA15 provide a key virulence mechanism for successful parasitism. Our preliminary findings suggest that this virulence mechanism is active in both murine and human hosts that are commonly infected by low virulence type II strains. The goal of this exploratory high impact R21 application is to identify the targets and the mechanism(s) associated with low virulence type II ROP16 and GRA15 molecules that provide resistance against the host to enable successful acute and chronic infection."
"9407040","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       The long-term objective of the proposed trial, International Study of Comparative Health Effectiveness with Medical and Invasive Approaches (ISCHEMIA), is to define the role of an invasive approach in patients with stable ischemic heart disease (SIHD) and substantial ischemia. The trial hypothesis is that cardiac catheterization followed by complete revascularization plus optimal medical therapy (OMT) is superior to OMT alone as the management strategy for patients with moderate-severe ischemia on stress imaging. The primary endpoint will be time to cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction (MI), or hospitalization for unstable angina, resuscitated cardiac arrest, or heart failure. The hypothesis that the invasive strategy will improve quality of life will also be tested. Cost-effectiveness will be assessed.   The COURAGE and BARI 2D trials found that an initial management strategy of coronary revascularization did not reduce the risk of death or MI compared with OMT alone in SIHD patients selected on the basis of coronary anatomy. These data raise the question whether cardiac catheterization (cath) is required in stable patients. Cath in such patients usually leads to revascularization. Although COURAGE and BARI 2D included a broad range of severity of myocardial ischemia on stress testing, most patients had mild-moderate ischemia. Observational data suggest that revascularization of patients with moderate-severe ischemia is associated with a lower likelihood of death and MI; this is not observed in patients with lesser degrees of ischemia. Only about half of patients with moderate-severe ischemia are referred for cath. It is unknown whether use rates for cath and revascularization are appropriate for optimal patient management in the era of modern medical therapy (particularly with high dose statins and antiplatelet therapy). This issue cannot be resolved using available data because prior clinical trials in SIHD have enrolled patients after cath, at which point there is substantial selection bias for enrollment based on coronary anatomy. Given the potential for improved survival and fewer cardiac events as a result of revascularization and the significant expense and risks associated with invasive management, the role of an invasive strategy is critically important to define. Defining that role is among the top 100 US priorities for comparative effectiveness research.    The proposed ISCHEMIA trial will be a prospective, multicenter, international, randomized, controlled trial that will directly address the need for an invasive strategy-cath and revascularization-in patients with SIHD. A total of 8,000 patients with moderate-severe ischemia and left ventricular ejection fraction >35% will be enrolled after stress imaging from more than 400 sites. Based on the need to exclude significant left main coronary artery disease, patients who meet eligibility criteria will undergo blinded coronary CT angiography. Patients will be randomized to an invasive group that will undergo routine cath with optimal revascularization, if feasible, plus OMT or to a group that receives OMT alone."
"9423661","Abstract ?Unpacking Treatment Mechanisms: Combining Evidence from Three Early Intervention Models for ASD?  Though randomized control trials (RCTs) of early intervention for children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) have shown evidence for the effectives of various treatment models, we know little about the mechanisms of treatment. Specifically, many early intervention models include parent coaching as a core strategy to increase the use of effective interactive strategies in parents to promote social communication in children. However, our knowledge about links between changes in parents' behaviors and changes in children's behaviors are still very limited. Therefore, the primary aim of this project is to combine evidence for treatment effects of early intervention and mediation of changes in parent behaviors on changes in child behaviors across the three RCTs of Early Start Denver Model (ESDM), Early Social Intervention (ESI), and Joint Attention Symbolic Play Engagement and Regulation (JASPER) treatment using innovative statistical techniques. The behaviors of the children and parents over the course of treatment will be measured based on approximately 1200 parent-child interaction videos that are already available over the course of three RCTs. Core ASD symptoms in children will be rated blindly using a newly validated treatment outcome measure, the Brief Observation of Social Communication Change (BOSCC), and parents' use of interactive strategies will be coded using a newly developed coding system of parent strategy use. Leveraging the recent advancement of the Behavioral Signal Processing (BSP) approach, we will also implement novel, objective automated acoustic measures to rate changes in children's and parents' behaviors in response to treatment. Combining data from the three RCTs will result in a sample size of 286 toddlers and young preschoolers from 1 to 4 years of age followed over the course of the three RCTs. The large sample size will increase the power of statistical tests to examine the moderators of treatment and mediation effects. Analyses of the combined data from 3 different studies and 5 different sites will enhance the generalizability of the inferences that can be drawn from our findings. Through this study, we hope to provide insight regarding for whom, how, and why early interventions can change behaviors and trajectories in autism. Findings will inform future development and dissemination of cost-effective early treatment models as well as service and policy level decision making to make the best use of resources for young children with ASD and their families."
"9431702","Project Summary This proposal describes a five-year mentored program with the specific goal of preparing the principal investigator for an independent research career in cardiovascular medicine. The project aims to impart the skills and knowledge required for the applicant to achieve his long-term goal of using tissue engineering to investigate kinase signaling pathways. The immediate goals of this project are to 1) gain the experimental experience necessary develop engineered cardiac microtissues from human iPS cells 2) expand the applicant's knowledge base with the appropriate coursework in stem cell biology, biomedical engineering and faculty development 3) develop the necessary administrative skills required to be an independent researcher 4) formulate a body of work that will enable funding as an independent investigator. The applicant will have the resources to achieve these goals under the guidance of his mentor Professor Vunjak-Novakovic as well as a carefully selected advisory board that will foster the transition of the applicant from mentored to independent research. Project Description In preliminary work, human cardiac progenitor cells were used as a tool for screening the kinome for important drivers of cell survival in cardiovascular physiology. We identified the serine/threonine kinase, STK25, as a regulator of cardiac progenitor cell survival and used both overexpression and knockdown studies to show that STK25 controls the 5'-AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) pathway in these cells. This impacted cell proliferation and metabolism. STK25 was also able to bind to LKB1, an upstream regulator of AMPK. We then investigated this pathway in cardiomyocytes which we differentiated from inducible pluripotent stem cells (iPS) and found that deletion of STK25 using a CRISPR-Cas9 system negatively regulated the AMPK pathway. Furthermore, this was shown to be deleterious to the mechanical performance of cardiomyocytes in simple strain assays. The goal of this proposal is to investigate the mechanism behind how STK25 regulates the AMPK pathway and to demonstrate the physiologic significance of that regulation in cellular based assays. Harnessing our expertise in tissue engineering, we will generate mature, adult-like human myocardial microtissues from iPS cells and use them to model the physiological impact of this signaling pathway with genetic manipulation of both STK25 and AMPK. This data will demonstrate the innovation of CPC's as a surrogate for cardiac signaling exploration, the mechanism by which STK25 impacts cardiomyocyte function and the therapeutic potential of this pathway on cardiomyocyte performance."
"9441826","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Scleroderma, or systemic sclerosis (SSc), is an autoimmune connective tissue disorder characterized by inflammation, fibrosis and vasculopathy. Right heart failure caused by pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is the leading cause of death in individuals with SSc, and approximately 10 to 15% of individuals with SSc will develop associated PAH (SSc-PAH). The combination of medical treatment options and systematic, routine screening has improved two-year survival for SSc-PAH, yet current screening tools are inadequate and the condition continues to remain under-diagnosed until it is too late. Preliminary data I have obtained demonstrate that even though resting PA pressures may be normal in SSc-PAH patients, hemodynamic evaluation during bicycle ergometry may unveil occult PAH. In fact, my preliminary data show 12 % of SSc patients with normal resting intra-cardiac pressures developed exercise pulmonary hypertension (mean pulmonary artery pressure e25 mmHg, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure d15 mmHg). In order to understand potential mechanisms which may contribute to the development of PAH, our laboratory has focused on the role of specific cell surface enzymes responsible for the catalytic degradation of purine nucleotides, which my mentor's group has shown to be critical regulators of thrombosis and inflammation at the vessel wall/blood interface. One of these ectoenzymes, CD39, is found on the surface of endothelial cells and leukocytes. In my own published data, I have shown that CD39 can be specifically measured on plasma microparticles obtained from patients with PAH. In fact, these microparticles retain their catalytic activity, and are surprisingly elevaed in patients with PAH compared with controls.6 My preliminary data also indicates that alterations in the concentrations of plasma nucleotides and adenosine (the CD39-mediated metabolites of ATP dephosphorylation) may contribute to pulmonary hypertension. These preliminary data lead me to hypothesize that a combination of early hemodynamic factors, right ventricular strain, and circulating plasma biomarkers can be used to identify patients with sub-clinical SSc-PAH who are at risk for the development of overt SSc-PAH. This proposal will study 225 patients with SSc who are at risk for developing PAH, as well as 75 healthy controls, to determine the extent to which hemodynamic parameters, echocardiographic markers of RV strain, and novel plasma microparticle and nucleotide biomarkers obtained at rest and during exercise can predict the development of SSc-PAH. I will complete this project under the mentorship of physician researchers with domain expertise in vascular biology, pulmonary arterial hypertension, SSc, biomarkers and bioinformatics, all of whom have strong track records of training and peer-reviewed funding. My project and relevant didactic coursework will serve as a training vehicle for me during this career development award by enabling me to learn elements of patient recruitment, data management, statistical analysis, acquisition/interpretation of meaningful hemodynamic and echocardiographic research data, and laboratory based analysis of plasma-based biomarkers of disease progression. This program, including didactic, immersive, and mentored components, will prepare me for an independent research career in patient-oriented research."

"9386072","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The cerebellum is critical for learning of motor skills. Since the 60's and 70's, the field has been working within the framework of the cerebellar learning theory: climbing fiber inputs to the cerebellum signal errors in movements; the conjunction of climbing fiber inputs and parallel fiber activity leads to depression of the synapse from active parallel fibers onto Purkinje cell dendrites; this long-term depression (LTD) causes changes in the simple-spike firing of Purkinje cells on subsequent movements; and the change in cerebellar output causes gradual improvements in motor performance and eliminates motor errors. Subsequent behavioral and neural studies suggest that learning is mediated by multiple plasticity mechanisms at several brain sites. The present proposal uses the smooth pursuit eye movements of awake, behaving monkeys to understand how a full neural circuit single organizes motor skill learning. The proposal first will describe the time course of development of multiple components of behavioral learning, especially a component that requires repetition of learning stimuli to consolidate. Next, the proposed experiments will study neural correlates of the different components of learning in three different areas in the cerebellar circuit for pursuit eye movements; Purkinje cells in the floccular complex, their target neurons (FTNs) in the vestibular nucleus, and Purkinje cells related to pursuit in the oculomotor vermis. The floccular complex already has been implicated in a single-trial component of learning, and the proposed research will ask whether consolidated learning also is represented there. Recordings from the other areas will allow quantitative conclusions about the extent to which neural learning is localized in the floccular complex, and whether multiple components of learning evolve over different time courses at different sites in the circuit. Motor skill learning is an essential mechanism for allowing humans to relearn old movements after strokes, and for maintaining excellent motor function as the nervous system ages. An understanding of the neural circuit mechanisms of motor learning should facilitate clinical approaches in motor disorders and stroke."
"9392578","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Chronic Hypertension and Pregnancy (CHAP) project is a large pragmatic multi-center randomized clinical trial designed to evaluate the comparative effectiveness and safety of pharmacologic treatment of mild chronic hypertension (CHTN) in pregnancy. During pregnancy, CHTN is the most common major medical disorder, most often mild (BP <160/110 mmHg), and is associated with a 3-5 fold increase in adverse outcomes including preeclampsia, perinatal death, preterm birth (PTB) and small for gestational age (SGA) infants (birth weight <10th percentile). Whereas antihypertensive therapy is a public health priority for the general population, authorities, including the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), recommend against BP lowering therapy during pregnancy unless hypertension is severe, i.e., e160/110 mm Hg, because of uncertain benefits and the concern that therapy may actually increase the risk of SGA. Based on supportive preliminary data presented herein, we hypothesize that antihypertensive therapy for CHTN during pregnancy to the goal <140/90 mmHg as currently recommended for the non-pregnant hypertensive population, will reduce the risk of several adverse pregnancy outcomes including SGA. During a 6-year project period, our consortium of 12 academic perinatal centers (25 sites), will identify 4700 women with mild CHTN and standardized BP<155/100 mmHg (which providers are more comfortable not treating) in early pregnancy and randomize them to either antihypertensive therapy (using labetalol) or to management according to ACOG recommendations (antihypertensive therapy for more severe CHTN). The women will be followed-up until discharge from the hospital after delivery and up to 3 months postpartum (long-term follow-up, including an interim 6-month phone call, is anticipated as a separate related project). The following Specific Aims will be addressed: 1.1 Primary Aim: To determine if pharmacologic treatment of mild CHTN in pregnancy to a standardized BP goal<140/90 mmHg, compared with standard management (per ACOG: no treatment unless hypertension is severe), reduces the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes including: 1) a severe perinatal composite outcome (perinatal death, severe preeclampsia, placental abruption or indicated PTB <35 weeks) and 2) SGA. 1.2 Secondary Aims: i. To better quantify the incidence during pregnancy of rare maternal cardiovascular risks associated with mild CHTN (including death, myocardial infarction, stroke, renal failure) and examine the effect of treatment. ii. To investigate the optial gestational age to deliver women with CHTN in order to minimize maternal and perinatal complications. iii. To collect and store biospecimens including maternal blood, cord blood and placenta biopsy for future biological and biophysical studies to understand the effects of antihypertensive therapy during pregnancy. iv. To evaluate whether antihypertensive treatment during pregnancy increases post-pregnancy treatment adherence.  This application summarizes the trial of the companion application and describes the operations of the DCC to provide full service electronic data capture, reporting and data management services. The extent of these data management services include: database specification, edit check programming, data management plan development and maintenance, ongoing manual data review and query management, medical coding and data cleaning and locking. Specific monitoring of observed blood pressures and blood pressure control along with safety monitoring will be a major endeavor. In addition, the DCC will provide statistical analysis (considering the pragmatic design) and reports which include the data summaries, tables, and statistical analyses for the DSMB."

"9455827","The diplococcic bacterium Neisseria gonorrhoeae (GC) is the causative agent of the sexually transmitted infection (STI) gonorrhea. Annually, gonorrhea affects over 78 million individuals worldwide. While the overall incidence has been decreasing, the emergence of multiple cases of antibiotic resistant isolates has again made gonorrhea a focus for intervention. In women, up to 50% of gonorrhea cases may be asymptomatic meaning that the infection remains untreated. This untreated infection can have serious reproductive health consequences with the potential development of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), which in turn can lead to serious sequelae such as ectopic pregnancies and infertility. Phase variation in GC has been observed as early as the 1970?s when clinical isolates grown on agar plates were classified into four groups based on the presence or absence of pilin and Opa proteins. While research on the effect of variation on infectivity is ongoing, characterization of the various surface proteins expressed during different stages of infection has not been studied. For the purpose of this proposal, enhanced infectivity or more infectious refers to isolates recovered from the female upper genital tract, i.e. the endometrium, uterus or fallopian tubes, and/or exhibit more severe symptomatology, including abdominal pain which may indicate complicated gonococcal infections such as PID. The ability of major surface proteins to vary their expression significantly complicates the development of a vaccine against GC. Recent advances in vaccine development that incorporate bioinformatics analysis to select potential vaccine candidates have emerged. Reverse vaccinology, pioneered by Dr. Tettelin in collaboration with the group of Dr. Rappuoli (Chiron, Novartis Vaccines, GlaxoSmithKline), was first used towards a protein-based vaccine against the other pathogenic member of the Neisseria genus, N. meningitidis. This led to the development and successful implementation of the 4CMenB vaccine (Bexsero) and provided renewed optimism that a N. gonorrhoeae vaccine is attainable. A 2016 proteomics-based study by Zielke et al. provides additional evidence of the feasibility of this type of analysis in our search for gonococcal vaccine targets. More detailed analysis, facilitating a more focused and streamlined process, can then be implemented to test the best vaccine candidates. Our project builds upon these foundations and focuses on GC changes that occur under relevant physiological conditions that would be encountered in vivo. We hypothesize that specific differentially regulated GC surface proteins are selected for during infection and these events enhance infectivity across multiple strains, thus providing targets for vaccine development. We will first characterize these profiles using GC laboratory strains then extrapolate them to similarities in profiles observed between GC clinical isolates that are readily transmitted and/or display enhanced infectivity."
"9468622","PROJECT SUMMARY Anxiety is a pervasive public health issue. Throughout the course of their lifetimes, one third of Americans will experience an anxiety disorder ranging from mild to incapacitating, and the prevalence of anxiety is rising. One suspected reason for this trend is that modern society promotes social isolation due to career demands and reliance on technology. Benzodiazepines (BZs) are widely used to provide rapid, effective anxiety relief by enhancing inhibitory signaling at synaptic GABAA receptors (GABAARs) throughout the brain. However, BZs cause side effects including dependence and sedation, and bind only to GABAARs containing gamma subunits. Social isolation downregulates gamma subunits in the rodent brain, reducing BZ efficacy. One brain region crucial for both anxiety and social behaviors is the lateral septum (LS). Inhibitory GABA-releasing (GABAergic) neurons predominate in the LS, but whether activity in the LS induces or relieves anxiety is controversial due to its broad interconnectivity with other regions. Because of this complexity, previous studies have not identified the precise functional changes in LS circuitry that occur during experiences like social isolation. Since ideal treatments for anxiety are unavailable, it is necessary to understand LS circuitry to design better drugs that selectively target anxiety circuits and not the entire brain. Thus, the objective of this proposal is to elucidate some of the specific GABAergic circuitry responsible for isolation-induced anxiety. An underexplored connection exists from the LS to the nucleus accumbens (NAc), a region that is thought to assign positive reward value to prosocial interaction. Pathophysiology in the NAc contributes to mental illnesses that are co-morbid with anxiety disorders, and social isolation decreases excitability in the NAc medial shell. In line with this, inhibiting the NAc caudal medial shell induces fearful behaviors. Therefore, the central hypothesis of this proposal is that social isolation activates an inhibitory GABAergic LS-to-NAc circuit, which encodes social reward deprivation and associated anxiety behaviors. To test this, two aims are proposed. Aim #1 endeavors to investigate isolation-induced physiological changes in NAc-projecting LS neurons. The hypothesis is that excitatory glutamatergic input to LS-to-NAc neurons is enhanced during social isolation, inhibitory input is reduced, and these neurons are less sensitive to BZ inhibition. Aim #2 proposes to define how LS-to-NAc neurons influence expression of social or anxiety behaviors. The hypothesis is that LS-to-NAc neurons directly inhibit the NAc during isolation, which decreases exploratory and prosocial behaviors. To accomplish these aims, the proposed experiments will use simultaneous two-color optogenetics (SToCO), chemogenetics (DREADDs), and behavioral assays in mice. Successful fulfillment of these aims will have immediate impact by revealing novel functions of a circuit from a region critical for social and anxiety behaviors (the LS) to a region critical for reward evaluation (the NAc). By uncovering the circuit and synaptic changes that link social isolation to anxiety, the proposed studies will allow for the development of superior therapeutics."

"9404966","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Mycobacterium tuberculosis (TB) remains the leading cause of death among persons living with human immunodeficiency virus and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) in southern Africa. This syndemic has resulted in an overwhelming burden for healthcare workers and the healthcare system. Drug- resistant TB remains a growing threat to public health despite advances in treatment and diagnosis over the past decade. South Africa has the world highest rate of TB/HIV co-infection and ranks fourth worldwide for multi-drug resistant (MDR) TB incidence and HIV prevalence. Treatment of MDR-TB, defined as resistance to isoniazid and rifampin, remains challenging and complex and success of second line treatment regimens is considerably less likely. Prospective cohort studies from South Africa report less than 50% treatment success (i.e. cure/completion) and marked differences between patients with and without HIV. International and South Africa specific MDR-TB guidelines recommend integration with HIV treatment programs and movement toward community-based programs within the primary care system. Although heralded as a major success by the HIV and TB treatment communities, implementation of TB/HIV integration in a community-based platform is much more challenging, requiring clinicians to navigate both HIV and MDR-TB treatment guidelines, overlapping drug toxicities and parallel care systems potentially leading to greater fragmentation of care. Nurse case management (NCM) models in which a registered nurse coordinates treatment plans to ensure that appropriate and timely care is given have been shown to improve treatment outcomes. There is little evidence to describe NCM of MDR-TB/HIV co-infected patients by registered nurses globally, and specifically MDR- TB/HIV in sub-Saharan Africa. The proposed 5-year interdisciplinary cluster randomized study will determine the impact and cost-effectiveness of a NCM intervention on MDR-TB treatment outcomes in South Africa, the epicenter of the MDR-TB/HIV epidemics. We hypothesize that the NCM intervention sites will report increased cure/completion rates of MDR-TB among patients with and without HIV compared to control sites. Sampling 10 clusters with 300 subjects each (1500 per group), achieves 88% power to detect a difference between the groups of 0.18; a clinically meaningful difference in MDR-TB treatment outcomes. The Chronic Care Model (CCM) identifies essential elements of a health care system that encourage high-quality chronic disease care in a bundled approach. These elements provided the conceptual framework for the proposed NCM intervention, a multi-faceted systems level intervention bundle to improve MDR-TB/HIV treatment outcomes. The proposed study is innovative and significant as it will translate a NCM intervention within the proven CCM framework in a low resource setting with a robust cost-effectiveness analysis. The study is globally relevant as it addresses the essential question of how can the implementation of TB/HIV integration occur in an evidence- based and sustainable manner."
"9469613","The goal of this project is to investigate the phenotype of a novel mouse model of schizophrenia (SCZ). Many genetic models of SCZ have been proposed, however, drug discovery has been limited and focused on treating symptoms of psychosis. We propose to evaluate a novel gene x environment interaction model of SCZ, and identify the common pathways contributing to disease development as novel targets for the development of therapeutics or prophylaxis. The glutamate pathway is a key contributor to the symptoms of SCZ, and our model represents multiple hits, genetic and environmental, to this pathway. We will subject mice with mutations in the Disrupted-in-Schizophrenia (DISC1) and Reelin (RELN) genes to prenatal immune activation using the viral mimetic Polyriboinosinic:polyribocytidylic acid (Poly I:C), and evaluate SCZ-like pathology and behavior. This is a highly salient model for SCZ, incorporating two distinct genetic mutations that are: 1) associated with SCZ; 2) produce similar neurobiological alterations; and 3) interact with immune activation to produce SCZ-relevant behavioral changes. Immune activation, while not a new area of study in relation to SCZ, has recently come under the spotlight with genetic susceptibility studies pinpointing complement component 4 (C4) genes as an important point of association between SCZ and variations in the major histocompatibility locus, and we expect this immune activation to exacerbate our SCZ phenotypes. This project bridges multiple SCZ hypotheses in a much needed integrative approach. We hypothesize that combined disruption of DISC1 and RELN will result in a more severe SCZ-like phenotype than either mutation alone, including behavioral and learning deficits, altered neurogenesis and dendritic morphology, and changes in complement pathway molecule expression; and these changes will be exacerbated by prenatal immune activation. Aim 1 will characterize the behavioral endophenotype of mice expressing dominant negative truncated human DISC1, and 50% of the normal amount of reelin, as it relates to expected SCZ behavior. Our preliminary data indicates changes in affect and cognition. Aim 2 will evaluate behavior with the addition of an environmental insult, prenatal immune activation, that is known to produce SCZ-like behavior, and to interact with both mutations individually. Aim 3 will determine if there are changes in complement molecule expression, neurogenesis, and long-term potentiation following both genetic and environmental hits. As this is the first study to characterize this model of SCZ, positive or negative data will add to the body of knowledge about the underlying biology of SCZ."
"9406507","ABSTRACT Small airway epithelial cell dysfunction and structural tissue remodeling are pathognomonic of chronic lung diseases, but molecular mechanisms are poorly understood. Much evidence indicates that initiation and/or progression of chronic lung disease is linked to progenitor cell dysfunction, hence suggesting that strategies aimed at modulating the regenerative capacity of epithelial progenitor cells could provide therapeutic benefits to patients. In preliminary studies we show that loss of alveolar type 2 (AT2) cells in lung tissue of patients with end-stage IPF is associated with distal airway basal and secretory cell hyperplasia. The source of distal airway basal cells and their contribution to repair vs remodeling in the setting of alveolar progenitor cell dysfunction is unclear. Influenza (PR8) virus infection in mice leads to recruitment of basal-like epithelial cells that expand to repopulate depleted epithelium. Our data suggest that the PR8-activated milieu of the infected lung leads to expansion of progenitor cell potency and acquisition of basal stem cell-like characteristics. We also found that the STAT3-dependent cytokine IL22 is induced early in the response to PR8 infection and was sufficient to initiate a program of basal cell differentiation in the absence of PR8 infection. Interestingly, we find that enhanced epithelial stemness by IL22/STAT3 signaling can be partially phenocopied by modulating p53 gene dosage. Based upon these data we propose to test the hypothesis that ectopic basal cell differentiation of distal airway progenitors enhances repair capacity in the face of severe injury and that these changes in cell fate are regulated by local production of IL22 leading to STAT3 mediated expansion of progenitor cell potency. Furthermore, we will test the related hypothesis that STAT3 effects of stem cell potency are mediated through suppression of p53. These hypotheses will be tested in aims that will take advantage of PR8 influenza virus infection in mice to understand roles for IL22/STAT3 innate immune signaling in regulation of progenitor cell fate and tissue repair or remodeling. Specific Aims will define roles for IL22/STAT3 signaling in regulation of airway progenitor cells (Aim 1), investigate mechanisms by which STAT3 regulates ?stemness? (Aim 2) and roles for nascent basal stem cells in repair and/or remodeling (Aim 3). Completion of these aims will provide new insights into cellular and molecular mechanisms of repair in acute lung injury and how persistent activation of these repair pathways might contribute to tissue remodeling in the setting of chronic lung disease. We anticipate identification of therapeutic targets that could lead to the development of novel therapies to alter outcome in patients with acute and chronic lung disease."
"9388374","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Rosiglitazone (RSG) is a synthetic agonist of the nuclear hormone Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor- ? (PPAR-??) and has been successfully used in the clinic for type 2 diabetes as an insulin-sensitizer. However, adverse cardiac side effects have seriously hindered its clinical application. Existing evidence from experimental models revealed that RSG results in cardiac hypertrophy, which may lead to heart failure. Currently, molecular mechanisms underlying RSG-induced cardiac hypertrophy remain unclear. Adipose tissue is a major site of PPAR-?? expression and function. Our preliminary dat showed that activation of PPAR-?? by RSG in adipocytes in a co-culture system resulted in cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. Furthermore, ablation of PPAR-?? in adipocytes attenuated RSG-induced cardiac hypertrophy in vivo. These data imply a functional interplay between adipose and cardiac tissue that regulates cardiac hypertrophy. Adipose tissue plays a critical role as an endocrine organ, and secretes cytokines that regulate systemic homeostasis and the function of other organs. Interestingly, a recent screen as well as our preliminary data revealed that adipocytes are able to release microRNAs (miRs). miRs are a family of highly conserved, small (~22 nucleotide) noncoding RNAs that post-transcriptionally repress gene expression by degrading or inhibiting translation of their target mRNA. The discovery of circulating extracellula miRs in serum suggests they may play a novel role in mediating cell-cell communication. Exosomes are the major transport vesicle of secretory miRs, allowing miR transfer and genetic exchange between cells. Our preliminary studies demonstrated that RSG stimulation of PPAR-?? signaling in adipocytes leads to upregulation of the miR-200a/b/429 cluster, and secretion o mature miR-200a in exosomes. Bioinformatics analysis and experimental investigation demonstrated that miR-200a can target components of the mTOR pathway, which regulates cardiac hypertrophy. In addition, we found that miR-200a was upregulated in a diet-induced obesity-associated cardiomyopathy model. The aforementioned suggest our overall hypothesis is that circulating members of the miR-200a/b/429 cluster mediate communication between adipose and cardiac tissue to adversely affect cardiac remodeling in two distinct models of cardiomyopathy. The overall goal of this project is to elucidate molecular mechanisms underlying adverse cardiac remodeling induced by adipose tissue, and provide insights into a novel exosomal miR-mediated pathway between adipose and cardiac tissue. Accordingly, our Specific Aims are: 1. To examine whether all members of the miR-200a/b/429 cluster are transported from adipocytes to cardiomyocytes in exosomes and to determine potential functional consequences of this in vitro; 2. To elucidate the role of miR-200a and the miR-200a/b/429 cluster in RSG-mediated cardiac hypertrophy in vivo by using adipocyte-specific knockout mouse models; and 3. To understand pathophysiological effects of miR-200a and the miR-200a/b/429 cluster in a mouse model of obesity-associated cardiomyopathy using adipocyte-specific knockout mice."
"9482162","The HIV and HSV-2 syndemic is well recognized, but the biological mechanisms that contribute are not understood. The recent recognition that HSV-2 is characterized by a frequent state of subclinical shedding suggests that the virus might contribute to persistent immune activation and prompted us to examine the impact of HSV-2 on peripheral blood T cells and on HIV reservoirs. Taking advantage of our biorepository of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from well-characterized HIV+ women on antiretroviral therapy who were or were not HSV-2 seropositive (HIV+/HSV-2+ vs. HIV+/HSV-2-), we found a significant difference in the phenotype of CD4+ (but not CD8+) T cells in HIV+/HSV-2+ compared to HIV+/HSV-2- women. These changes included an increase in the frequency of activated cells, but a paradoxical decrease in the expression of IL-32, an intracellular cytokine presumed to be associated with inflammation. Moreover, when CD4+ T cells isolated from virally suppressed HIV+/HSV-2+ women were stimulated with latency reversal agents, the addition of recombinant IL-32 to the cultures blocked HIV reactivation. These observations suggest that IL-32 plays a pivotal role in controlling HIV reactivation and suggest a new paradigm underlying the HIV-HSV-2 syndemic. We hypothesize that HSV-2 triggers changes in local (at the site of HSV-2 genital skin outbreaks) and peripheral blood CD4+ T cells including a reduction in intracellular IL-32 levels that promote HIV reactivation. Conversely, high levels of IL-32 contribute to the maintenance of HIV reservoirs suggesting that IL-32 blockade may synergize with strategies to reactivate HIV as part of a ?shock and kill? approach to cure. To test these hypotheses, we will analyze serial samples of PBMC from HIV infected women before and after HSV-2 acquisition from two unique cohorts: women enrolled in Microbicides Trial Network (MTN)-015, a longitudinal study of African women who seroconverted to HIV while participating in pre-exposure prophylaxis trials, and U.S. women with established HIV infection enrolled in the Bronx Women's Interagency Study (WIHS). We will also compare PBMC in HIV-infected men who are or are not coninfected with HSV-2. We will phenotype immune cell subpopulations to define the changes that occur in association with HSV-2 acquisition and the impact of these changes on plasma viral loads and HIV reservoirs. We will prepare CD4+ T cell libraries of IL- 32lo cells and determine whether these subpopulations are enriched in HSV-2 and/or HIV reactive cells and whether decreased IL-32 interferes with immune functions. We will also take advantage of our repository of genital skin biopsies (herpes lesion and unaffected contralateral side) and analyze the CD4+ T cells to determine whether they are enriched for cells of specific phenotypes in situ. We will determine how IL-32 blocks the response to latency reactivating stimuli and how IL-32 antagonists promote HIV reactivation. These studies will identify pathways and molecules that could be targeted to block HIV reactivation in response to HSV-2 or conversely, enhance latency reversal as part of ?shock and kill? HIV eradication strategies."
"9413274","PROJECT SUMMARY  Many chronic pain patients complain of abnormal sensitivity to multiple sensory modalities, including light, sound, and smell. The underlying neural basis remains a puzzle and these claims are often viewed with suspicion, since sensory acuity per se is not enhanced, nor is there amplified processing in primary sensory pathways. The central thesis of this proposal is that dysfunction of brainstem pain-modulating systems, already thought to contribute to pain in these conditions, is also likely to play a role in multisensory hypersensitivity. This hypothesis is based on our unexpected observation that a subset of pain-modulating neurons in the rostral ventromedial medulla, the final output of an important brainstem pain-modulating system, respond to light. In three Specific Aims using single-cell recording approaches in rat, we will fully characterize the RVM response to light, generating stimulus-response functions and establishing the relevant spectrum. We will also determine whether photoresponsiveness of these neurons is enhanced in an animal model of migraine headache (where photosensitivity is well documented) or in a persistent inflammatory state. Finally, we will investigate ?top-down? modulation of photoresponsiveness from a higher brain structure known to contribute to stress-induced hyperalgesia and implicated in endocrine, autonomic, and behavioral responses to mild stress. The present proposal brings together electrophysiological and behavioral approaches to determine how light engages pain-modulating systems, effectively converting a visual stimulus to a somatic sensation, producing discomfort and aversion. These studies will provide fundamental insights into the neurobiological mechanisms of multisensory hypersensitivity, information critical to developing more appropriate treatments for migraine and other chronic pain disorders."
"9470331","Project Description  As the population of individuals living beyond 65 years old increases, so does the incidence of neurocognitive diseases, leading to a decrease in quality of life. Thus, it is necessary to investigate mechanisms of cognitive aging and identify strategies for improving health outcomes in the elderly. The objective of this mentored training proposal is to determine the mechanisms behind the efficacy of a ketogenic diet for alleviating cognitive and neurometabolic decline in a rat model of old age. A ketogenic diet, which utilizes ketone bodies and fat as a fuel source, is particularly well suited for treating age-related dysfunction and disease. In fact, the decreases glucose metabolism and insulin dysregulation that are observed with advanced age and are a major risk factor for Alzheimer?s disease, are known to be reversed by a ketogenic diet. Specifically, the ketogenic diet bypasses glucose metabolism, enabling cells to utilize ketone bodies. Importantly, ketone metabolism has been shown to remain effective later in life relative to glucose metabolism capabilities. Based on preliminary data, the experiments in this proposal will test the central hypothesis that, by reducing the need for glucose metabolism, the ketogenic diet will improve hippocampal neuronal signaling, thereby improving behavioral performance. Furthermore, we will test the efficacy of direct application of ketone bodies systemically and intracranially into the hippocampus to aid in the determination of the mechanism s of efficacy of this treatment approach. This hypothesis will be tested with the following aims: 1) determine if ketosis can restore hippocampal circuits to improve behavioral performance; and 2) determine if ketone body administration attenuates age-related cognitive deficits. Under the first aim, a biconditional association task will be used to confirm the efficacy of a ketogenic diet, as well as direct application of ketone bodies, at restoring age-related cognitive decline. Neuronal activity during this behavior in brain regions providing inputs and outputs of the hippocampus will be quantified at the single cell level and correlated with behavioral performance to determine the degree to which age and ketosis affect neuronal communication. Under the second aim, direct hippocampal infusions of ketone bodies will be given prior to testing rats on a complex object discrimination task that is sensitive to aging, requires the hippocampus, and allows to a within-subjects assessment of performance. The proposed approach is innovative, because it represents a substantive departure from the status quo by integrating techniques from multiple levels of analysis, leading to a greater understanding of the effects of a ketogenic diet on age-related impairments. This work will be significant because it will support the development of therapeutic strategies for treating age-related decline in addition to several age and metabolic related disease states. Ultimately, such knowledge has the potential to improve quality of life and reduce the growing problem of both age-related cognitive and metabolic decline in the growing elderly population."
"9581552","Project Summary/Abstract Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is a devastating neurodegenerative disease that initially manifests with either bulbar or spinal (limb) symptoms. Bulbar involvement leads to speech and swallowing impairment and recurrent aspiration pneumonia. Death due to respiratory failure occurs within 2-3 years for patients with bulbar onset ALS and 3-5 years for limb onset cases. To date, no treatment exists for this relentless and fatal disease. The only FDA approved drug for ALS is Riluzole ? a glutamate release inhibitor which minimally increases life by 3-5 months. As diaphragm and respiratory muscle weakness progress, targeted respiratory therapy with non-invasive ventilatory support improves survival. Therefore, the goal of this proposal is to use gene therapy to target the respiratory system (upper airway, diaphragm and intercostals) in a popular ALS mouse model ? the SOD1G93A mouse and assess if this improves breathing and survival. This application proposes to study the impact of respiratory directed gene therapy on spontaneous breathing, pulmonary mechanics, and respiratory efferent nerve output. Adeno- associated virus (AAV) gene therapy coupled with microRNA that silences SOD1 (miRSOD1) will be delivered through retrograde transduction to the entire motor unit (muscle, neuromuscular junction, nerve and motor neurons). In addition, this proposal aims to study the impact of respiratory targeted and systemic gene therapy on pulmonary physiology and neurophysiology outcome measures as well as behavioral testing and survival. Thus, the fundamental hypothesis driving this proposal is that AAV- miRSOD1 gene therapy targeting the upper airway and respiratory system will enhance breathing in the ALS SOD1G93A murine model; and when coupled with systemic delivery of AAV, will improve respiratory function, mobility and prolong survival. Two specific aims are proposed: Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that an intralingual and intrathoracic injection of AAV-miRSOD1 will effectively transduce the entire hypoglossal and phrenic motor units and stimulate respiratory drive. Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that systemic AAV-miRSOD1 delivery coupled with respiratory targeted therapy will halt degeneration, improve survival and enhance respiratory function. Project Relevance: This work is innovative because it will use gene therapy to target respiratory insufficiency (the main cause of death in ALS patients) in an ALS mouse model. The impact of this therapy will be assessed using translational pulmonary outcome measures with the ultimate goal of translating this therapy to the clinic. AAV gene therapy is now in clinical trials and if successful, this therapy will provide a therapeutic option for respiratory failure in the patients with mutations in the SOD1 gene."
"9558831","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): NFATc1, NF?B, cFOS, PU.1/SPI1 and MITF are transcription factors (TFs) essential for osteoclast differentiation from myeloid precursors. However, large gaps still remain in our understanding of the interplay between these TFs and how this interplay contributes to osteoclast differentiation and function. Importantly, critical questions about how the dynamics of TF regulation contributes to clinical outcome of human bone related diseases are unresolved. During the last cycle of this grant we used newly available functional genomic approaches and new bioinformatics approaches to develop a hierarchical network model that explains the interactions between these factors and their relative roles in osteoclast differentiation. Based on this model our overriding hypothesis is that PU.1 and MITF are at the apex of an osteoclast transcription factor network in osteoclasts and their myeloid precursors that initiates and maintains the differentiated state in response to signals received from the local microenvironment. In the current proposal, we aim to test this model using both in vivo and in vitro experiments and importantly to extend these studies into normal human osteoclasts and circulating osteoclast precursors from rheumatoid arthritis patients. Further we will test the importance of this network and associated factors in a preclinical mouse model for rheumatoid arthritis, using approaches that genetically target Pu.1 or use small molecule inhibitors to target PU.1/MITF-dependent epigenetic changes in pre-osteoclasts. By combining our efforts and expertise, our multidisciplinary team will focus on the task of understanding the mechanisms that govern osteoclast differentiation and function, and the relevance of these factors in human osteoclasts."
"9392537","ABSTRACT  Host-microbe interactions are paramount for maintaining normal physiology of the human host, including the brain and behavior. Bacterial colonization of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, formation of GI mucosal barrier function, and neurogenesis all occur during a critical developmental window in early life. Thus, exposure to trauma such as stress, infection or inflammation during neonatal life could detrimentally impact the developing microbiota, gut and brain (MGB) axis. Disrupted MGB axis signaling, including dysbiosis, mucosal barrier defects and/or changes in behavior, occur in multiple diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), autism spectrum disorder, major depressive disorder, and obesity.  Antibiotics (Abx) are administered to children more frequently than adults, due to increased susceptibility to bacterial pathogens. Since the MGB axis is developing during this critical time, Abx administration may have long-lasting effects. Administration of probiotic organisms can ameliorate numerous pathologies, including dysbiosis, mucosal barrier dysfunction, inflammation and behavioral defects. We have demonstrated that Lactobacillus-containing probiotics can prevent stress-induced MGB axis deficits following infection with a bacterial pathogen. We hypothesize that administration of specific probiotics can prevent neonatal Abx- induced deficits in the adult MGB axis. Therefore, our primary objective is to address the effects of neonatal dysbiosis on the development of the MGB axis using a model of neonatal Abx administration. Our overall goal is to determine whether intestinal dysbiosis disrupts the gut-brain axis, and whether administration of probiotics beneficially modulates the MGB axis. This goal will be accomplished by the following Specific Aims: (1) neonatal dysbiosis disrupts the developing MGB axis, (2) NOD-like receptors (NLR) are critical for MBG axis development; and (3) selective probiotics can restore MBG axis deficits via NLR.  Taken together, these proposed studies will demonstrate whether neonatal dysbiosis disrupts the developing MGB axis, impacting the microbiota composition, altering NLR signaling, and causing behavioral deficits in adulthood. Furthermore, we will determine whether administering select probiotics ameliorates these effects, in part via NLR signaling and thereby support use of select probiotic strains therapeutically for altered MGB axis. Finally, our results may promote use of probiotics concomitantly with Abx administration to prevent development MGB axis deficits, particularly in children and neonates."
"9392933","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Purpose of this project is to advance understanding of coagulation mechanisms that promote hemostasis in response to vascular injury but also cause diseases involving vascular thrombosis. In Aim 1, we will delineate a previously unrecognized convergence of extrinsic and intrinsic coagulation pathways differentially regulated by physiological and pharmacologic inhibitors and relevant to thrombin generation. This aim is predicated on the novel observation that, without thrombin feedback contribution, nascent FXa generated by TF-FVIIa can provide the activated cofactors, FVIIIa and FVa, required for assembly of functional intrinsic tenase (FIXa- FVIIIa) and prothrombinase (FXa-FVa) complexes, respectively. We will define the mechanisms underlying this newly recognized synergistic coagulation pathway studying reactions with purified components or in plasma; and we will establish how these mechanisms contribute to thrombus formation in blood flowing over TF and collagen as model thrombogenic surfaces, thus evaluating individual variability in response. In Aim 2, we will dissect the distinct contributions of different coagulation pathways to pro-hemostatic or thrombogenic processes. These studies stem from the observation that physiological coagulation inhibitors and FXa-directed anticoagulants differentially regulate the TF-dependent FXa activity generating FVIIIa and FVa as opposed to FXa required for prothrombinase function. Consequently, thrombin generation directly linked to TF pathway activation may be markedly inhibited while preserving TF-dependent FVIIIa and FVa cofactor production required for intrinsic tenase-driven prothrombinase activity. We hypothesize, therefore, that thrombin generation during hemostasis or thrombosis may involve a different balance of procoagulant and anticoagulant pathways in response to distinct vascular lesions and/or blood conditions that variably activate extrinsic and intrinsic coagulation pathways. Thus, we will evaluate the variability in the response of individual plasma samples to the anticoagulant effect of direct FXa inhibitors in clinical use - such as rivaroxaban and apixaban - and study mechanisms of thrombus formation elicited by cellular and matrix components of the vessel wall to define their relative contribution to coagulation initiation. Moreover, we will establish how different coagulation pathways, including the newly identified synergistic link between extrinsic and intrinsic coagulation, contribute to platelet thrombus formation and fibrin deposition induced by components of the atherosclerotic plaque. Recognizing the distinct coagulation pathways contributing to thrombus formation that may differentiate normal hemostasis from thrombosis will advance our understanding of serious pathological conditions resulting from vascular occlusion as well as excessive bleeding. Ultimately, our studies will have a positive impact on basic and translational research relevant to the prevention and treatment of socially relevant diseases associated with arterial and venous thrombosis or hemorrhage."
"9392576","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a disorder resulting from failure of the upper airway to maintain patency during sleep. OSA is associated with extensive comorbidities, including hypertension, cardiovascular disease and stroke, as well as with significant cognitive dysfunction. The cardio- and neurovascular consequences of the disease are believed to result from periodic nocturnal hypoxia-reoxygenation cycles. While the normal physiologic response to volitional apnea (breath-holding) maintains cerebral oxygen delivery via reduced cardiac output, peripheral vasoconstriction, and central vasodilation, this response becomes blunted in OSA secondary to chronic intermittent hypoxia experienced during repeated nocturnal apneic events.  Building on our recent work in developing techniques for quantifying the cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen consumption (CMRO2) to investigate brain oxygen metabolism, we propose to further develop and apply a new MRI method to study the neurometabolic-neurovascular consequences of OSA. Key to the method is the quantification of venous blood oxygen saturation from a measurement of magnetic susceptibility, which scales with deoxyhemoglobin concentration and which, along with cerebral blood flow, yields CMRO2. Since apnea represents a mixed hypercapnic/hypoxic stimulus for which no steady-state is reached, capturing the physiologic response requires high temporal resolution. Responding to this need, the investigators have developed a vastly accelerated CMRO2 measurement technique and shown its ability to resolve dynamic changes in CMRO2 in response to volitional apnea in healthy subjects at 3T and demonstrated its feasibility in OSA patients on a wide-bore 1.5T system. We posit that the breath-hold paradigm is a suitable model to evaluate the neurovascular response in OSA as it reflects the intermittent hypoxia experienced by apneics during sleep. In this project we hypothesize that the neurometabolic profiles in patients with OSA are impaired, including lower CMRO2 at baseline and blunted neurometabolic response to a breath-hold challenge. Further, we hypothesize that continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) treatment will alleviate this abnormal response. These hypotheses will be addressed in four specific aims, comprising: (1) further development and validation of the method; (2) application to a cohort of OSA patients and their controls; (3) evaluation of the effect of CPAP in the cohort of Aim 2; and (4) an exploratory sleep study in a subset of patients to compare the neurometabolic effects of wakeful volitional and spontaneous nocturnal apnea. The proposed neurometabolic MRI measures could ultimately serve to identify patients at greatest risk of the neurocognitive and neurovascular sequelae from OSA, and to predict the efficacy of CPAP therapy. Further, the method could allow triaging of OSA patients to more invasive treatment approaches and provide an improved means for risk assessment in those affected by this increasingly prevalent disorder."
"9448046","PROJECT SUMMARY The basis for the success of radiation therapy is long believed to be direct killing and elimination of cancer cells. Therefore, most previous research efforts have focused on enhancing the direct killing effects of radiotherapy. However, recently, it was realized that the host immune system plays key roles in determining the treatment outcome of cytotoxic cancer therapy. In many instances, it has been shown that radiation therapy can activate the immune system to attack cancer cells. However, the molecular mechanisms involved in radiation-induced immune cell activation are poorly understood. In the current project, we intend to test the hypothesis that blockade of certain apoptotic caspases will enhance the efficacy of radiotherapy and immune checkpoint inhibitors by increasing immunogenic cell death. Our hypothesis is based on both published data on the immune-stimulatory effect of radiotherapy and our preliminary data demonstrating strong immunogenic effects of blocking apoptotic caspases. To test our hypothesis, we will attempt to dissect the roles of individual caspases by use of murine tumor cells with CRISPR-Cas9 mediated genetic knockout and evaluating their response to radiotherapy in vitro and in mice (Aim 1). We will then try to identify downstream factors of caspases that are important in radiation induced immunogenic cell death (Aim 2). Finally, we will evaluate if inhibition of caspases is a feasible strategy to enhance radiotherapy in combination with immune- checkpoint inhibitor therapy (Aim 3). Upon completion of our proposed project, we hope to establish the biological roles of apoptotic caspases in immunogenic cell death during radiotherapy and lay the foundation for evaluating caspase inhibitors as potential agents to enhance radiotherapy and immuno-checkpoint inhibitor therapy in human patients."

Overseen by an experienced multidisciplinary administrative team and paralleling UA's expanding research strengths, MSRP students choose from a spectrum of in vivo, in vitro, in situ, in silico, and modeling approaches to the cardiovascular (CV) system and its disorders (cardiac contractility, development, hypertrophy, microcirculatory physiology, endothelial biology, electrophysiology, oxygenation, heart failure, resuscitation, CV genomics/proteomics, CV prosthetics, arterial/venous disease, lymphology); pulmonology (asthma, cystic fibrosis, sleep apnea, organogenesis); and cell-based science/therapy; with cross-cutting themes in bioengineering/multimodal imaging; drug/device discovery R&D; and various other topics of specific interest to student researchers and spanning translational steps from bench to bedside to clinical practice and population health. Based on a 32-year track record reflected in the latest MSRP followup/survey, we anticipate cultivating an enlarging number of diverse scientific physicians who understand and can contribute to the research enterprise and a growing cadre of physician-scientist leaders to replenish the dwindling supply of translational researchers. Detailed S/T and L/T formative/ summative program/participant evaluation, including database registry, individual development plans, and career portfolios, will be continued to document efficacy."
"9600721","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Glycosulfopeptides (GSP) represent a novel type of complex glycoconjugate, which contain a recognition motif consisting of clustered tyrosine sulfates (Tyr-SO3H) and a core 2 O-glycan that bears a sialyl LewisX-containing hexasaccharide epitope (C2-O-sLeX). GSPs are present in PSGL-1, GPIba, endoglycan, VWF, Factor VIII, and CCR5, among many other biomolecules and play critical roles in innate immunity, thrombosis, and cancer. Despite the potential of sLeX-GSPs to serve as tools for biological studies and their promise as therapeutic agents, their utility has been limited by low yield and limited stability. Recent innovations by the investigative team in chemical and molecular genetic techniques have established an important new framework for the design of sLeX-GSPs and related multicomponent conjugates. Specifically, we intend to: (1) Define efficient schemes for scalable generation of GSPs containing tri-member recognition motifs (Tyr-SO3H, C2-O-sLeX, peptide backbone). Poor regio- and stereoselectivity and low yield continues to pose a significant challenge for the synthesis of C2-O-sLeX hexasaccharides and related variants. To overcome these limitations, we will design convergent glycosylation schemes in association with low temperature pre-activation, building blocks that require minimal protecting group manipulation, as well as one-pot schemes for glycans containing sLeX. To expand the diversity of novel GSP structures, new analogues will be generated in which tyrosine sulfates are replaced by sulfonates, Glu or Asp, and sulfated sugars incorporated in the glycan. (2) Identify orthogonal bioconjugation strategies for the construction of GSP bearing microarrays, as well as microspheres and liposomes as cellular `avatars'. Chemical and genetic orthogonal bioconjugation schemes will be investigated for the construction of microarrays containing printed GSPs, as well as GSP bearing microspheres and liposomes as cellular `avatars' to mimic cell-like presentation of ligands. In addition to standard bioorthogonal approaches, such as click chemistry and native chemical ligation, mutant sortase variants that exhibit orthogonal substrate specificity for peptide sequences LPETG, LAETG, and LPESG will be used to construct highly divergent GSP supramolecular systems. In the process, we will also define complementary approaches for the generation of GSP multimers and macrocycles. (3) Construct libraries of native and non-natural sLeX-bearing GSPs for the identification of highly potent selectin, integrin, and chemokine antagonists. We will generate microarrays, microspheres, and liposomes presenting GSPs modeled after human and murine PSGL-1, GPIba, endoglycan, and CCR5. Candidate high affinity selectin, integrin, and chemokine antagonists will be identified through a combination of microarray-based screens, Biacore analysis, flow cytometry, and microfluidic cell binding assays. GSP-derivatized microspheres and liposomes, as cellular `avatars', will define the density- and presentation-dependent features that influence molecular recognition."
"9386769","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The prevalence of heart failure continues to rise with unacceptable rates of morbidity and mortality. Currently, over 6 million Americans have been diagnosed with heart failure with an associated annual health care expense estimated at 35 billion US dollars and rising. The single most important cause for heart failure is ischemic cardiomyopathy, where loss of cardiomyocytes due to ischemic events is the main driver of disease. Due to limited rates of cardiac regeneration (estimated at 1% new cardiomyocyte formation per year during normal aging), the workload on remaining cardiomyocytes is increased, giving rise to cardiac hypertrophy and ultimately heart failure. Since the most important driver of heart failure is loss of cardiomyocytes, the discovery of cardiac progenitor cells (CPCs) in the adult heart that can give rise to all cardiac lineages when cultured uncovered the possibility of enhancing cardiac regeneration. Up until this point cell therapy using cultured CPCs has been the main method used to enhance cardiac regeneration. However, most injected cells die within weeks and the ultimate improvement in cardiac function is likely mediated by endogenous CPCs. The current proposal will identify ways of stimulating CPCs to enhance endogenous regeneration. Our long-term goal is to understand how endogenous CPCs are activated in response to cardiac injury and what determines CPC fate decisions in vivo with the ultimate objective of finding strategies that enhance endogenous cardiac regeneration. We recently published genetic mouse models that allow lineage tracing of endogenous cardiac progenitor cells and will use these mouse models throughout this proposal. Upon genetic lineage tracing of endogenous CPCs we noted many endothelial cells being generated, but only few cardiomyocytes. However, we hypothesize that endogenous CPCs can be activated to enhance their cardiogenic potential. The proposed genetic mouse models and manipulations of specific signaling pathways will be used to identify strategies to enhance cardiac regeneration. Our specific aims are to 1) Determine whether and how different stimuli activate endogenous cardiac c-kit+ CPCs toward cardiac lineage, 2) Determine whether blocking endothelial fates will activate endogenous c-kit+ CPCs to become cardiomyocytes, and 3) Establish to what extent Notch1 signaling is important for c-kit+ progenitor proliferation and differentiation toward both endothelial cells and cardiomyocytes. The goal of this study is to define pathways that can stimulate endogenous cardiac progenitor cells to produce more cardiomyocytes. Future studies will employ strategies to enhance the proliferation and differentiation of eCPCs to improve cardiac regeneration."
"9445040","ABSTRACT  Pediatric pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) remains a diagnostic challenge. Children swallow their sputum rather than coughing it up, making analysis with standard TB tests difficult to perform. We led the development and testing of the Xpert MTB/RIF (Xpert) assay, which simultaneously detects the presence of M. tuberculosis and its susceptibility to the important first line drug rifampin in less than two hours. Hailed as a major advance for detecting adult pulmonary TB, the test is suboptimal for detecting pediatric TB since sputum samples may be difficult to obtain, and repeated testing is necessary for acceptable sensitivity. Here, we propose to adapt the Xpert sputum assay so that it can be performed on the stool of pediatric TB suspects, developing a simple- to-use kit that can rapidly detect TB in children. We will then test this assay using a newer assay cartridge (Ultra) that is approximately 10 times more sensitive and almost twice as rapid as current Xpert MTB/RIF cartridge. Our hypothesis is that swallowed M. tuberculosis currently detected in induced sputum samples or gastric aspirates of pediatric patients should be concentrated and detectable in stool. Stool is the final repository of all swallowed respiratory secretions and it is easily obtainable from infants and children, making it an excellent test matrix. We will develop and test a simple sample processing bottle that can pre-process large (> 1 gram) volumes of stool, removing particulate matter and PCR inhibitors, without compromising PCR TB detection. The contents of the bottle will be able to be squeezed into the Xpert assay cartridge with little difficulty or unpleasantness. The ?Ultra stool? assay will be as easy to perform as the ?Xpert sputum? assay, and will have the same or better diagnostic sensitivity and specificity. The successful completion of this project will literally transform pediatric pulmonary tuberculosis diagnosis. This proposal builds on an existing US ? South African collaboration focused on testing novel TB assays, enabling an established clinical and laboratory team to work on this new problem. This project has the following four aims: 1) develop and test ?out of cartridge? sample processing protocols that maximize the sensitivity of the Ultra assay to detect M. tuberculosis in stool. 2) Perform extensive analytic tests of the Ultra stool assay focusing on limit of detection, inclusivity, specificity, effect of different stool samples, effect of different M. tuberculosis strains and susceptibility to interfering substances. 3) Develop and test a simple stool pre-processing bottle. 4) Perform iterative evaluation of the assay using stool samples from a cohort of children presenting with symptoms suggestive of pulmonary TB .

"9391147","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Almost nothing is known about how exposure to key risk factors in early life influences cognitive function and its decline later in life. Evidence suggests that the neuropathologic process leading to dementia, especially Alzheimer disease and vascular dementia, begins decades before clinical features become apparent. Recent research has convincingly demonstrated that mid-life risk factors, especially those related to cardiovascular disease and lifestyle factors, have a substantial impact on later life cognition. However, much less is known about earlier, e.g. young adult, risk factors and their effect on cognition in mid-life and later. We propose to address this gap by conducting an innovative ancillary study to the ongoing CARDIA study. CARDIA is a multisite prospective study of 5,115 black and white adults, aged 18-30 years at baseline (1985-86), who recently completed their seventh (year 25) follow-up in which cognitive testing and brain MRIs were measured and who will be participating in a year 30 exam in 2015-16. We propose to repeat and augment the cognitive testing for the year 30 visit on an estimated 3100 participants. In the first study of it kind in the United States, we propose to estimate 30-year trajectories of key vascular, metabolic and lifestyle factors, and quantify brain region volumes by MRI to assess their relationship to level and change in cognition in adulthood. In addition, we will use already collected genome-wide genetic data to investigate the association of genetic variants, which are known to influence these risk factors and brain MRI outcomes, with cognition. Completion of the scientific aims will help determine when cognitive changes begin to occur in mid-life and the use of a life course approach will allows us to study long-term exposure, from early life onward, in hopes of studying the potential effect of risk factor modification.

"9407190","Regulation of lung development by FGF9 signaling pathways Summary  Lung disease is the fourth leading cause of death and disability in the United States. The origins of lung disease often begin during development or early in life and developmental mechanisms are often redeployed in acquired disease. Thus, it is essential to unravel the complex mechanisms that regulate lung development to understand the pathogenesis of developmental, genetic, and acquired lung disease. Moreover, to design therapeutic approaches for repair or regeneration, and to treat cancers and other disorders, it is necessary to determine how signaling networks coordinate development and become dysregulated in disease.  We have identified Fibroblast Growth Factor 9 (FGF9) as a developmental signaling molecule that is expressed in lung mesothelium and epithelium that has an essential role in regulating lung mesenchyme and a proposed secondary role in regulating lung epithelium during embryonic development. In lung mesenchyme, we identified a feed-forward regulatory network that links mesenchymal FGF9-FGFR1/2 signaling and Wnt/?- catenin signaling. We also showed that deregulated expression of FGF9 disrupts lung development through expansion of mesenchymal and epithelial compartments, as in the case of Pleuropulmonary Blastoma (PPB), a heritable pediatric lung cancer that arises from lung mesenchyme.  During the previous funding period we found that in PPB, which is initiated by loss of function mutations in DICER1, that lung epithelial micro RNAs function to suppress Fgf9 expression during development. Loss of these regulatory micro RNAs, through mutation in DICER1 and resultant deregulated expression of FGF9 contributes to the mesenchymal hyperplasia and possibly the cystic lesions that are characteristic of Type I PPB. We also found that deregulated expression of FGF9 in the adult results in an FGF receptor (FGFR) 3- dependent rapid induction of epithelial proliferation with progression to adenocarcinoma. These studies highlight the necessity to tightly regulate FGF9 expression and activity in the embryo and in the adult.  Here, we propose experiments that will uncover mechanisms that regulate Fgf9 and that will identify how FGF9 and Wnt/?-catenin signaling regulates epithelial and mesenchymal target tissues. Because micro RNA control of Fgf9 expression appears to primarily function during very early (pseudoglandular) stages of lung organogenesis, we hypothesize that additional mechanisms are necessary to control (suppress) Fgf9 at later stages. In Aim 1 we will examine the regulation of Fgf9 expression by the histone methyltransferase, EZH2, a component of the Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2), as a mechanism to place long lasting repressive marks on the Fgf9 gene. Aims 2 and 3 will examine signaling mechanisms that are downstream of FGF9 in mesenchyme and epithelium, respectively. This is important because the identity of the downstream target genes and the transcriptional mechanisms that couple FGF9 and Wnt/?-catenin signaling to the regulation of these target genes are not known."
"9397573","Project summary Ischemic heart disease (IHD) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in the US. Adult heart is largely dormant, designed primarily to perform pump function and responding to pathological challenge by limited myocyte turnover with development of scar tissue at the site of injury. Incredibly, cardiac tissue during developmental stages consists of actively diving cardiomyocytes and is able to resolve injury by formation of new tissue. The fundamental question is whether adult heart can be somehow driven into a developmental signaling state restoring cellular replacement without compromising pump function. Cardiac progenitor cell- based (CPC) applications have been widely used to resurrect myocardial repair processes and have moved into clinic but are limited due to underperformance of the donated cells. In most cases, CPCs are harvested from elderly patients with an adverse cardiac tissue morphology including host of clinical features reducing therapeutic efficacy of the cells and their cell-free agents such as exosomes. Interestingly, CPCs are known to possess incredible growth and repair properties during fetal and neonatal cardiac stages and understanding unique signaling hubs regulating CPC performance during development may open up a novel avenue for enhancement of CPC therapy. Ideally changing cardiac microenvironment to resemble a developmental cardiac tissue may offer a powerful way to restore lost cardiac repair ability. Our preliminary data indicates miR-294 signaling axis enhances cardiac performance including core CPC function mediated by its downstream target Lin28a. Therefore, we hypothesize that reintroduction of developmental miR-294-Lin28a signaling axis in CPCs will promote CPC properties reminiscent of more primitive developmental stage where the heart can better repair itself. Our goal is to enhance CPC therapy including the potency of cell-free agents such as exosomes by induction of developmental signaling to repair the heart after myocardial damage. We will extend these studies to develop a therapeutic strategy on miR294-Lin28a based modification of human heart derived CPCs and their exosomes that enhances cardiac structure and function after injury. Enhancement of cardiac cell therapy by reintroduction of developmental signaling provides a new direction for CPC based cell therapeutics and treatment of heart failure."

"9404051","PROJECT SUMMARY Familial hypercholesterolemia is an autosomal dominant disease most often caused by loss of function mutations in the low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR). Loss of both LDLR alleles in homozygous FH (HoFH) results in excessively high levels of plasma cholesterol, xanthomas, premature atherosclerosis, and death in the first decades of life if untreated. Current treatments are largely ineffective for HoFH and more permanent solutions are desperately needed. Liver-directed gene therapy using Adeno-Associated Viral (AAV) vectors is an area of intense research that is very near to achieving meaningful correction of several inherited diseases. While ongoing clinical trials with AAV are showing promising results, conventional (additive) gene therapy has limitations including: transgene silencing, imprecise control of expression levels, immune responses to transgene and capsid protein, and the loss of episomal AAV genomes to cell division. We believe many of these may be solved by a gene editing approach using the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-Cas9 system. Our long-term goal is to refine and optimize our AAV-based gene therapy platform for repair of disease-causing alleles underlying the most severe lipid disorders. The objective of the current application is to perform preclinical gene therapy to correct the metabolic defect in Familial Hypercholesterolemia (FH) in a mouse model via AAV-based genome editing. Our central hypothesis is that AAV-mediated homologous recombination, in combination with CRISPR/Cas9 directed DNA cleavage, can effectively repair a mutant version of the Ldlr gene with high efficiency. In Aim 1 we will determine the optimal Cas9 ortholog and guide RNA sequence for AAV-mediated site specific disruption of the Ldlr gene in mouse liver. In Aim 2, we will use these vectors, along with a recombinant AAV genome harboring a ?repair template? to deliver the functional ?wild type? exon for Ldlr. The extent of editing and correction will be assessed at the genetic as well as phenotypic levels- include changes in plasma lipids and susceptibility to atherosclerosis. Completion of the aims will produce a powerful AAV-based system for somatic gene knockdown and repair in the liver, which can be broadly applied for both basic science and gene therapy applications."
"9473172","Summary  Lymphocytes within lymphoid tissues are regulated by a vascular-stromal compartment comprised of blood vessels, lymphatic sinuses, and non-vascular mesenchymal reticular cells, and understanding the functions and regulation of this compartment can have implications for better understanding and treating lymphoproliferative and autoimmune diseases. We have recently shown that fibroblastic reticular cells (FRCs) are in distinct functional states at homeostasis and in inflamed lymph nodes. Our long-term goal is to understand other functional features of the vascular-stromal compartment in inflamed nodes, how these features contribute to regulating immune responses, and how these features in inflamed nodes are induced. Here, we show that FRCs upregulate CCL2 during a phase of the immune response that corresponds to plasma cell accumulation. FRCs express CCL2 at high levels in the vascular-rich medulla and vascular-rich regions of the T zone, which are also the sites of plasma cell localization. We show that CCL2 limits plasma cell survival and that vascular permeability may play a role in inducing the FRC functional phenotype in these vascular-rich regions. We propose to test the hypothesis that, during this phase of the immune response, features of vascular-rich microenvironments regulate plasma cell function and vascular activity regulates FRC functional phenotype in these areas. Our aims are 1) to understand how CCL2 regulates plasma cell survival and 2) to understand how vascular activity contributes to modulating FRC functional phenotype. The results from this proposal will provide new insights into lymphoid tissue vascular-stromal function and regulation, plasma cell regulation, and a potential link between cardiovascular health and the immune system. This link is especially relevant for autoimmune diseases such as lupus that are characterized both by vascular dysfunction and immune system dysfunction marked in part by plasma cell accumulation"
"9392583","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Blood bicarbonate, which is in direct contact with the endothelium, can become elevated during respiratory diseases or following infusion (i.e to correct acidosis associated with lung protective mechanical ventilation strategies), yet its effect on the endotheliul are unknown. Na+-bicarbonate cotransporters (NBC) transport bicarbonate into cells. In the cytosol, bicarbonate can activate cytosolic adenylyl cyclase isoform 10, AC10, which generates cytosolic cAMP and disrupts the pulmonary endothelial barrier. The goal of this proposed research plan is to understand how the NBC is regulated and the mechanism of AC10 induced permeability in the setting of acute lung injury (ALI). It has been observed that while transmembrane AC generates juxtamembrane, barrier protective cAMP, the toxic bacterial soluble AC, ExoY, generates, barrier disruptive cAMP and increases permeability. Increased permeability contributes to the mortality and morbidity of Acute Lung Injury (ALI) and Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). Thus, understanding how NBCs regulate AC10 activity and how endogenously generated cytosolic cAMP regulates pulmonary endothelial barrier integrity to exacerbate ALI and ARDS is of clinical interest. Specifically, in vitro, in situ and i vivo experimental models will be used to determine whether Na+-bicarbonate cotransporters and AC10 contribute to bicarbonate influx and generation of cycotsolic cAMP signals in pulmonary endothelial cells derived from either conduit arteries or the gas exchange segment of the vasculature, the septal capillaries (Specific Aim 1). We will determine whether the NBC, NBCn2, is inhibited by juxtamembrane cAMP signals (Specific Aim 2) and whether bicarbonate transport through NBCn2 to activate AC10 is required disrupt microtubule architecture and disrupt the endothelial barrier (Specific Aim 3). Techniques to be used include: immunohistochemistry and fractionation studies to determine NBC expression between different vascular beds; pH and sodium measurements to determine NBC activity; both cell-free and in-tact cell measurements of cAMP using cAMP turnover and radioimmunoassay in addition to spatial and temporal FRET-cAMP measurements using hyperspectral image analysis; immunoprecipitation assays and site directed mutagenesis to identify phosphorylation sites on NBCn2; Western analysis with phospho-specific antibody to detect changes in tau phosphorylation; detection by detection of free versus polymerized tubulin to identify changes in microtubule architecture; video microscopy, permeability and resistance measurements to detect changes in endothelial barrier integrity in vitro; and the isolated perfused lung model to measure the filtration coefficient (Kf), lung wet/dry ratio and alveolar fluid volume fraction in stu. Further, we will perform additional isolated lung studies following intraperitoneal LPS administration to induce ALI. These experimental technique and various experiment groups will be used to test our hypothesis."
"9413200","Abstract  Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disease of the central nervous system (CNS) that affects 400 thousand Americans. In MS attacks, peripheral blood leukocytes gain access to the brain parenchyma and attack white matter structures. Effective therapies for MS target the steps by which these leukocytes gain access to the brain, called the leukocyte adhesion cascade. These therapies, while effective, can cause rare infectious complications and exhibit variability in response between individuals. A more complete understanding of the leukocyte adhesion cascade may lead to therapies that are safer and effectively treat disease in patients that do not respond to current treatment.  Crawling of leukocytes within the blood vessels towards sites of inflammation is an important part of the leukocyte adhesion cascade and is the least understood of its steps. Chemokines may guide the directed intravascular crawling of leukocytes, but proof and mechanistic detail are lacking. Most current knowledge about crawling comes from in vivo studies which are limited in scope due to low throughput. An in vitro model to enable the dissection of this process in fine detail and with high throughput would advance the field.  To address this, I designed a microfluidic device that uses principles of laminar flow to allow careful studies of the mechanisms underlying directed leukocyte crawling for the first time in vitro. This device allows high resolution live video imaging of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and their adhesion cascade interactions with human brain microvascular endothelial cells (hBMEC). Production of this device and cell culture within it are now routine, allowing us to pursue the objective of establishing whether endothelial cells guide leukocyte intravascular crawling via chemokines.  The project has two specific aims. Aim 1 will answer whether intraluminal chemokine gradients can plausibly direct intravascular crawling by testing whether an acellular chemokine gradient is sufficient to induce directed crawling of leukocytes. This will be extended by quantifying leukocyte crawling behavior on a directionally-stimulated endothelium in the device. Finally, the contribution of chemokine receptors to these phenomena will be assessed, using drugs to block downstream signaling and antibodies to block ligation.  Aim 2 seeks to shed more light on an alternate pathway that has been proposed: direct signaling of endothelial cells to leukocytes via Golgi-derived vesicles laden with chemokine. To do so, we will use lattice light sheet microscopy (LLSM) to quantify chemokine-laden vesicle trafficking with a high degree of spatiotemporal resolution. We will use this information to test whether the trafficking of these vesicles is influenced by fluid flow, proximity to endothelial-endothelial boundaries, and the presence of adherent leukocytes.  The proposed experiments will significantly advance our understanding of leukocyte intravascular crawling, as well as provide refined models for future studies of this phenomenon, which has implications for cell-mediated autoimmune diseases such as MS."
"9393693","PROJECT SUMMARY Alcohol use disorder (AUD) persists as a costly public health problem that lacks widely effective medications and strategies for prevention. The overarching scientific premise of this Project, like the others of the Wake Forest Translational Alcohol Research Center (WF-TARC), is that the neural substrates that contribute to vulnerability and resilience to AUD are not fully understood. Studies using nonhuman primate (NHP) subjects have specific advantages that make them a critical part of a comprehensive, translational approach to addressing this topic, including the possibility of experimental control not possible in human subjects and a greater similarity to humans' neurobiology compared to rodents. Group-housed monkeys form linear social hierarchies; social rank has been shown to influence sensitivity to abuse drugs, with subordinates showing vulnerability to the abuse-related effects of stimulants and ethanol (EtOH). Project 2 of the WF-TARC will exploit this differential sensitivity across social ranks to determine the behavioral and brain mechanisms that underlie vulnerability to develop AUD. Behavioral studies will characterize rank-related differences in induction of EtOH drinking, EtOH consumption over one year of 22 hours-per-day access and EtOH seeking behavior during abstinence using an extremely well-characterized NHP EtOH self-administration model of long-term drinking in humans. We will also determine whether dominant and subordinate monkeys differ in sensitivity to chronic treatment potential medications for AUD. In parallel to these experiments, brain imaging studies using magnetic resonance imaging will characterize the structural and functional differences between dominants and subordinates, and determine the specific changes that occur in grey and white matter integrity, cerebral blood flow and functional connectivity during long-term EtOH drinking and subsequent abstinence. Importantly, these NHP studies occupy a critical position in the translational structure of the WF-TARC, supporting forward and backwards translation to inform and extend findings in rodent and human projects. NHP imaging studies will focus on the same brain regions and nodes that will be imaged in human subjects and studied and manipulated in rodents. Secondary analyses on imaging data will expand this focus to the entire brain. Taken together, the results of the studies in this Project, particularly in combination with data generated in other components of the WF-TARC, will provide a comprehensive account of brain differences between populations that are resistant versus vulnerable to AUD. This knowledge will ultimately help practitioners direct preventive efforts to groups who will most benefit from them, and will identify new targets for more effective medications targeted to the most vulnerable populations."
"9392922","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cardiovascular diseases are leading causes of morbidity and mortality. One such disease is left ventricular noncompaction (LVNC), in which trabeculae fail to undergo compaction. Trabeculae are sheet-like structures extending from the myocardium to the heart lumen and function to pump efficiently. A lack of trabeculation causes embryonic lethality in mice and excess trabeculation causes cardiomyopathy and heart failure in human. Its clinical relevance is exemplified by trabecular non-compaction cardiomyopathy, in which trabeculae fail to undergo compaction and about half a million Americans suffer from this disease. Despite the fundamental nature of this morphogenic process and its critical clinical implication, the cellular and molecular mechanisms that regulate trabeculation are not clear. During trabecular initiation, myocardial cells protrude into the cardiac jelly and are oriented perpendicular to the heart wall. We deleted the intracellular adaptor protein Numb and its homolog Numblike, known as Numb Family Proteins (NFP) in mouse heart to generate myocardium NFP double knockout (MDKO) and found that MDKO hearts displayed a variety of cardiac defects, including a marked disruption in the trabecular initiation and cardiomyocyte differentiation. 3-dimentional (3D) imaging indicates that cardiomyocytes in MDKO fail to protrude into the heart lumen. Using lineage tracing/mosaic mouse model, we found that the majority of the NFP null clones failed to localize to the trabeculae. Our central hypothesis is tha NFP regulate trabecular initiation and differentiation by controlling directional migration and oriented cell division (OCD) via N-cadherin (N-CAD) dependent mechanisms, which will be tested by two aims. Aim I: Determine whether NFP regulate trabecular initiation by controlling directional migration and OCD. We will perform multicolor lineage tracing using the Brainbow mouse in which single cells in the heart tube will be genetically labeled before trabeculation, which allows us to analyze the localization of each labeled cardiomyocyte descendants and track their dynamics during trabeculation. Time-lapse 4D imaging will be applied to observe how cardiomyocytes initiate trabecula. We will identify if OCD is an asymmetric cell division and contributes to trabecular cardiomyocyte differentiation. This aim will reveal the cellular basis fo trabecular initiation and morphogenesis. Aim II: Determine whether NFP regulate trabeculation by stabilizing N-CAD. We will determine the functional residues/domains of Numb that are required for migration and N-CAD expression. Epistasis analysis and transgenic line rescuing will be applied to determine the genetic interaction between N-CAD and Numb. This aim will begin to reveal molecular mechanisms of how NFP regulate trabeculation. Completion of these aims is expected to yield novel insights into the cellular and molecular mechanisms of trabecular initiation and cardiomyocyte differentiation in vivo, and the functions of NFP in these processes, which will ultimately provide a mechanistic basis for treating non-compaction cardiomyopathy and morphogenesis related congenital heart defects (CHD)."

"9395940","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Advances in HIV treatment have dramatically changed the course of HIV disease. The focus of clinical care has shifted from treating opportunistic infections to managing chronic, non-AIDS-related complications. Cardiovascular disease (CVD) has emerged as a major challenge to the long-term health of HIV patients, who face a higher risk than patients without HIV disease because of specific, HIV-related factors which accelerate the development of CVD. The management of CVD and other co-morbidities may differ in the setting of HIV, and significant questions regarding CVD risk prediction and prevention remain unanswered. To provide the best care to HIV populations as they age, there is an urgent need to develop rigorous, evidence-based, HIV- specific CVD risk prediction strategies. Through the proposed study, we will evaluate and develop methods to accurately predict CVD risk in HIV patients, addressing a major knowledge gap in HIV clinical care. These analyses are particularly timely given the paradigm shift occurring in the field of CVD prevention, with the recent development and introduction of a new American College of Cardiology (ACC)/American Heart Association (AHA) risk prediction algorithm which is a key component of newly released cholesterol guidelines. We propose several novel analyses, including 1) the first evaluation of the new ACC/AHA CVD risk prediction algorithm in the setting of HIV; and 2) the first incorporation of HIV itself into CVD risk prediction models. Our study will address the following aims:  Specific Aim 1: To assess the performance of existing cardiovascular risk prediction algorithms  in an HIV clinical care cohort  Specific Aim 2: To generate and internally and externally validate new cardiovascular risk  prediction algorithms for tailored use in HIV populations To achieve these aims, we will leverage a multidisciplinary team that is comprised of internationally-recognized leaders with the required expertise in relevant fields. Dr. Ralph D?Agostino will serve as Co-Principal Investigator and will apply his decades of experience in risk prediction statistical analysis to lead a team to validate and develop the new risk prediction algorithms. The HIV cohorts which will be used to generate and externally validate the newly-developed HIV-specific risk prediction algorithms are uniquely suited for these analyses and have produced seminal studies in the field of HIV and CVD. Our proposed work aligns with specific research priorities identified in the new 2013 ACC/AHA risk assessment guidelines which include validation of the new CVD risk prediction algorithm in diverse clinical settings. Our findings will have a significant clinical and public health impact, optimizing CVD risk prediction in HIV and informing CVD prevention strategies to improve the long-term health for this population."

"9387462","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) is a rare, multisystem disease of women. Pulmonary LAM consists of a diffuse proliferation of smooth muscle actin-positive cells and increased lymphatic vessel density. LAM cells harbor inactivating mutations in either the TSC1 or TSC2 tumor suppressor gene, resulting in constitutive activation of mammalian TOR (target of rapamycin) complex 1 (mTORC1). mTORC1 integrates growth factor and nutrient signaling to stimulate cell growth and metabolism. Critical unmet needs in LAM are the development and optimization of effective therapeutic strategies and the availability of sensitive and specific biomarkers of disease progression and response to therapy, which could streamline the design, duration, and cost of early phase clinical trials. Our long-term goal is to identify mTORC1-dependent or independent metabolic vulnerabilities of LAM cells that can be targeted therapeutically in LAM. In lipidomic studies, we identified enhanced choline phospholipid metabolism in cellular models of LAM compared to control cells, and elevated phosphatidylcholine (PC) and lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) species in LAM patient plasma compared to healthy women. Our central hypothesis is that abnormal lipid metabolism contributes to the molecular pathogenesis of LAM and represents a source for therapeutic targets and metabolic imaging biomarkers of disease progression in LAM. This hypothesis will be tested in three Aims. Aim 1. To identify the molecular mechanisms underlying dysregulation of choline phospholipid synthesis in LAM. Our working hypothesis is that the de novo PC synthesis and PC remodeling pathways are aberrantly activated via mTOR-dependent and independent mechanisms in TSC2-deficient cells. Aim 2. To determine the impact of aberrant lipid metabolism on LAM cell proliferation and LAM-associated lymphangiogenesis. Our working hypothesis is that lipid and signaling modifications downstream of choline kinase or PLA2 participate in the proliferation of LAM cells and trigger lymphatic microvascular endothelial cell migration and proliferation. Aim 3. To determine the impact of therapeutic targeting of choline phospholipid metabolism in LAM in vivo. Our working hypothesis is that aberrant lipid metabolism in LAM can be targeted therapeutically and used diagnostically. We will conduct preclinical trials of inhibitors of choline phospholipid metabolism using mouse models of LAM, [11C]choline Micro-PET (positron emission tomography) to detect in vivo changes in choline uptake of TSC2-deficient cells, and a mouse-ear model of LAM cell-associated lymphangiogenesis. The proposed studies have clinical significance because they will address the potential for key enzymes of the choline phospholipid pathway as targets in LAM therapeutics, and for [11C]choline as a metabolic imaging biomarker of disease progression and/or response to treatment in LAM patients."
"9402583","Project Summary In sub-Saharan Africa, the primary data for estimating HIV epidemic trends is HIV prevalence among pregnant women attending antenatal care (ANC). ANC sentinel surveillance has been conducted every one to two years since the early 1990s across the continent. A ?convenience sample? consisting of ten to twenty facilities in each country were selected to be sentinel sites in which a sample of pregnant women were tested for HIV each year. National estimates of HIV incidence and prevalence are created by fitting a mathematical model called ?EPP? to the HIV prevalence trend in these clinics and prevalence estimates from national household surveys. This makes strong assumptions that epidemic trends in a few non-randomly selected sentinel sites are representative of the national epidemic. This project will evaluate and improve these assumptions about how to extrapolate from sentinel sites to national trends, specifically aiming to (1) characterize the spatial representativeness of selected ANC sentinel sites across sub-Saharan Africa, (2) test for differences in HIV epidemic trends across sentinel sites, (3) develop and validate an approach to propagate uncertainty in epidemic estimates resulting from relying on a small number of sentinel site locations, and (4) demonstrate the impact of the these findings for estimates of HIV prevalence and incidence trends in sub-Saharan Africa. The primary data will be geo-located existing ANC sentinel surveillance data from countries across sub-Saharan Africa, and will also rely on remotely sensed population spatial covariates for population density and accessibility. Spatial and longitudinal statistical models will be used to test several hypotheses: H1.1: sentinel sites are disproportionately selected in areas of higher population density and more accessible to major roadways and urban centers; H1.2: population HIV prevalence is higher in areas surrounding selected sentinel sites; H2.1: HIV prevalence declined more in sites with higher prevalence; and H3.1: statistical uncertainty about historical incidence and prevalence is much greater than represented by current estimates that do not account for sentinel site selection. Taken together, the implications of these hypotheses may be that current interpretation of ANC surveillance data has resulted in systematically over-estimating peaks and declines in national HIV epidemics in sub-Saharan Africa and spuriously precise epidemic estimates that do not give adequate weight to more representative data sources, such as national household sero-surveys. Results of the project will be reported to the UNAIDS Reference Group on Estimates, Modelling, and Projections (http://www.epidem.org) and will result in improved methods for the UNAIDS EPP/Spectrum software used to generate official national estimates of HIV prevalence, incidence, and mortality in sub-Saharan Africa."
"9394817","Atherosclerosis and its complications, such as myocardial infarction, stroke, and peripheral artery disease, are the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the U.S. Therefore, novel therapies are urgently needed to inhibit the progression of atherosclerosis. CD4+Foxp3+ regulatory T cells (Treg) suppress vascular inflammation and atherosclerosis in both humans and mice. However, the mechanisms underlying Treg suppression of atherosclerosis remain poorly defined. Interleukin-35 (IL-35) is a newly characterized anti-inflammatory cytokine, mainly secreted from Treg, which inhibits inflammation resulting from various conditions, including autoimmune diabetes and arthritis, etc. Compared with the other well-characterized anti-inflammatory cytokines, IL-10 and TGF-?, IL-35 is more powerful, and IL-35 significantly converts effector T cells and B cells to inducible Treg and regulatory B cells.  IL-35 is a heterodimer composed of p35 and Epstein-Barr virus induced gene 3 (EBI3) subunits. Both IL-35 subunits are strongly expressed in endothelial cells (EC) and macrophages (M?) in patients' atherosclerotic plaques, suggesting that IL-35, but not IL-27, is upregulated in atherosclerotic lesions. Compared with healthy controls, IL-35 is decreased in the plasma of patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) while related cytokines IL-12 and IL-27 are increased in patients with CAD. However, the roles of IL- 35 in suppressing EC activation and atherogenesis have not been studied.  The goal o is to determine the roles and mechanisms underlying IL-35 suppression of EC activation and atherosclerosis. We have a long publication record of studying EC activation, EC dysfunction, monocyte (MC) recruitment, atherosclerosis, and decreased Treg in acceleration of vascular inflammation. We have obtained strong preliminary data and published two papers (J.B.C.; PLOS ONE) showing that 1) IL-35 is a responsive cytokine, which is not constitutively expressed in most cell types and is significantly induced in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammation and in atherogenic apolipoprotein E (ApoE-/-) mice; 2) IL-35 shares EBI3 subunit with its relative cytokine, IL-27. In contrast to IL-27, IL-35 inhibits EC activation induced by proatherogenic Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) ligand, LPS, by suppressing the expression of vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1) via mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)- AP-1 dependent pathway in human aortic EC; 3) IL-35 inhibits lysophosphatidylcholine (lysoPC, an oxLDL- derived proatherogenic lipid stimulus)-induced EC activation; 4) Mechanistically, IL-35 inhibits lysoPC- induced generation of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mtROS) in human aortic EC; 5) We established an IL-35 therapy model in ApoE-/- mice and found that IL-35 therapy inhibits atherosclerosis; and finally, 6) we have generated EBI3-/-/ApoE-/- double knock-out (KO) mice and are also in the process of generating two additional double KO mice, including IL-12R?2 (an IL-35 receptor (IL35R) subunit)-/- /ApoE-/- double KO mice and p35 (IL-35 subunit)-/-/ApoE-/- double KO mice. These strong preliminary data and publications suggest that IL-35 may suppress EC activation and atherosclerosis. f h t is project The central hypothesis to be examined is that IL-35 inhibits EC activation and proinflammatory ly6Chigh MC recruitment, thereby contributing to suppression of atherosclerosis. We will test this hypothesis using three linked, specific aims briefly described below. Aim 1 will determine the expressions and suppressive function of IL-35/IL-35R subunits in human aortic EC activated by proatherogenic stimuli and aortas of ApoE-/- mice (relevant studies). Aim 2 will examine the mechanisms underlying IL-35 suppression of EC activation and monocyte/M? recruitment during atherosclerosis (mechanistic studies). Aim 3 will determine the mediating roles of IL-35 subunits p35, EBI3 and IL-35R subunit IL12R?2 in atherogenesis in ApoE-/- mice (therapeutic studies). Success of this proposal will lead to the identification of the role and mechanisms underlying IL-35 suppression of EC activation and MC//M? recruitment and atherogenesis. The results will hold great promise for the future development of IL-35-based therapeutics for suppression of vascular inflammation and atherosclerosis."
"9390498","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  This NIH K08 proposal describes a five-year training program for career development in academic neuropathology and developmental neurogenetics. Dr. Matthew Rose has completed clinical residency in Anatomic Pathology and fellowship in Neuropathology at Brigham and Women?s Hospital (BWH) and Boston Children?s Hospital (BCH) at Harvard Medical School (HMS), and will embark on a research program designed to train for an independent academic career in neurologic disease-oriented research.  In this training program, Dr. Rose will acquire in-depth experience in the study of ocular motor neuron (OMN) development and axon targeting, interpretation of single cell RNA-sequencing, analysis of gene regulatory networks, tissue clearing and advanced imaging approaches, and gene-editing technologies. His mentor, Dr. Elizabeth Engle (a Professor of Neurology and HHMI Investigator at BCH), is a leader in brainstem OMN development and congenital cranial dysinnervation disorders (CCDDs) that involve these motor neurons. Her laboratory has extensive experience in human and mouse genetics, neuroanatomy, large data analyses, molecular biology, imaging, and cell culture techniques. She has an established track record for mentoring other trainees to successful careers in biomedical investigation. In addition to his mentor, he has assembled a group of collaborators with complementary expertise in these disciplines, and an Advisory Committee of senior faculty with extensive experience in guiding physician-scientists through the transition to independence. He will supplement this training with didactics and presentation of work at national meetings.  The primary scientific goal of the proposed research plan is to study normal and abnormal OMN specification and axonal growth and guidance in health and disease. Dr. Rose provides an initial map of the genetic differences among brainstem motor neurons that may serve as a foundation for further studies of all motor neuron diseases. These preliminary data will be used as a foundation to further study the development of the OMN subnuclei by discovering markers of each OMN subpopulation, and then applying those markers to the study of the CCDDs. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that the differences in gene expression among OMN subpopulations may predispose certain subtypes to undergo dysinnervation in different CCDDs.  Single cell RNA-seq will be performed on the three primary OMNs: the oculomotor, trochlear, and abducens brainstem nuclei, in order to discover markers of each subpopulation. In combination with ATAC-seq, the transcriptional regulatory networks for OMN specification will be investigated. Unique markers of each OMN subpopulation will then be used to study normal OMN axon projections to distinct muscle targets, as well as using them to dissect the contributions of different populations to the stereotypic and pathologic aberrant innervations observed in the CCDDs. These studies have significance to the broader fields of neuronal specification and differentiation and to axonal growth and guidance."
"9392575","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Asthma has significant human health and economic impacts. Excessive mucus is an important cause of airflow obstruction in fatal asthma. It is also present in mild to moderate disease, but is poorly understood and treated. Mucus overproduction in asthma is associated with the dysregulated expression of two mucin glycoproteins - MUC5AC and MUC5B. Increased MUC5AC is a consistent finding, but MUC5B varies. It remains stably produced in some patients, but is strongly repressed in others (>90%), resulting in as much as 400-times more MUC5AC than MUC5B. This dichotomous expression pattern occurs in patients who display the strongest acute responses to the inhaled bronchoconstricting agent methacholine (MCh). This airway hyperreactivity (AHR) feature can be modeled in mice through allergen exposure. Knockout mice lacking Muc5ac are protected from AHR, indicating that it is a critical mediator of asthma-like airflow obstruction. Thus, determining specific mechanisms of MUC5AC-mediated AHR may reveal important mechanisms of obstruction and potential targets for improving airflow in asthma. As part of a long term goal of elucidating the functions of MUC5AC and MUC5B in the airways, Muc5ac and Muc5b knockout and overexpressing mice will be used to model dichotomous mucin expression in human asthma, and to test the specific effects of each mucin on the biophysical properties of mucus that promote obstruction. In addition to their differential expression, emerging data show that MUC5AC and MUC5B have distinct disulfide polymer structures. They also have specific glycosylation patterns: MUC5B is sialylated, MUC5AC is fucosylated. Fucosylation increases mucus viscoelasticity, and FUT2, the enzyme that catalyzes mucin ?1,2-fucosylation, is associated with asthma exacerbation risk. Thus, the concept driving this proposal is that mucins with distinct polymer and glycan structures establish the obstructive potential of airway mucus. Accordingly, the proposed studies test the hypothesis that MUC5AC mediates AHR through specific disulfide and fucosylation mechanisms that cause obstruction by promoting mucus viscoelasticity. Three Specific Aims are proposed: 1) demonstrate that MUC5AC, but not MUC5B, mediates acute AHR in allergic mouse airways; 2) determine whether increased mucus viscoelasticity is caused by MUC5AC-specific polymerization and fucosylation; 3) determine whether MUC5AC disulfide and fucosylation-dependent viscoelastic properties are critical mechanisms of AHR and mucus plugging. Wild type and mucin mutant mice will be studied at baseline, and under conditions of allergic inflammation induced by Apergillus oryzae extract exposure. Lung function, mucociliary clearance, and mucus viscoelasticity will be measured. The effects of pharmacological, enzymatic, and genetic inhibition of polymerization and fucosylation will be determined. Successful completion of these studies will advance our mechanistic understanding of AHR, and could identify novel strategies to prevent obstruction while preserving airway defense in asthma and other lung diseases."

"9058016","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term goal of this project is to establish a set of powerful technologies that enable special and temporal control of the epigenome. We hypothesize that, by selectively and biochemically perturbing a single protein (or even single domain within a protein), we can control the epigenome with high precision. Thus, this project aims to utilize state-of-the-art protein engineering technologies to generate high-performance binding proteins to epigenetic regulatory proteins that can be genetically encoded for intracellular use. We will utilize the designer binding protein platform, termed monobody that we have pioneered and refined over the last decade. Monobodies are designer binding proteins built using the fibronectin type III (FN3) scaffold. Unlike conventional antibodies and their fragments, FN3 lacks disulfide bonds and thus monobodies fold into their functional form under reducing conditions, such as the nucleus and cytoplasm within cells. Therefore, the monobodies are particularly suited as genetically encoded, intracellular inhibitors against epigenetic regulatory proteins.  By utilizing sophisticated technologies that we have developed over the last decade, we will generate monobodies to many epigenetic regulatory proteins that have high affinity and exquisite specificity. We will develop companion technologies that enable novel applications of monobodies toward understanding and controlling epigenetic regulatory processes. Specifically, we propose the following aims: Aim 1.  To develop high-specificity, high-affinity monobodies to readers and writers of chromatin modifications. Aim 2. To develop technologies for using monobodies as genetically encoded inhibitors directed to epigenetic regulatory proteins and validate monobodies from Aim 1 for intracellular use. Aim 3. To develop chemoepigenetic technologies for temporal control of the chromatin regulators in developing cells using monobody inhibitors, in particular CHD7 in the context of neural crest differentiation and the CHARGE syndrome. We will make these powerful tools available to the community.  We have assembled a team of experts with complementary skills and this project will leverage resources and expertise available through a network of collaborators. We have a strong track record of innovations and enabling the research community. Technologies and knowledge gained in this project will provide the epigenomics research community with novel and powerful tools and lead to new approaches to controlling the epigenome for positively impacting human health. Together, this project is perfectly aligned with the vision of the RFA."
"9385749","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose to demonstrate biologic and pathophysiologic roles for platelets via the chemokine platelet factor 4 (PF4) in T-helper cell homeostasis and chronic transplant immune responses. PF4 is best known for its role in the pathogenesis of heparin induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), but despite its high plasma concentration, biologic roles for PF4 are not well understood. Our new exciting data demonstrate that PF4 is needed to limit Th17 differentiation in both steady state and inflammatory conditions. We propose the hypothesis that platelets maintain T-helper balance in a PF4 dependent manner. This presents the novel concept of cross-talk between platelets and CD4+ T-cells and extends the role for platelets in immunity to an acquired immune role in the maintenance of T-helper balance.  T-helper cells get their name from the fact that their cytokines influence many other cells such as increasing neutrophil and monocyte numbers and inflammatory profile and T-helper cells are necessary for B- cell antibody class switching. Therefore, platelet regulation of T-helper numbers and types implies a major role for platelets in immune homeostasis. T-helper cells are divided into Th1, Th2, Th17 and Tregs. Our data indicates that in the absence of PF4 there are greatly increased numbers of Th17 cells at steady state, and in a mouse model of vascularized cardiac transplant Th17 numbers increase greatly post-transplant. We have also discovered that PF4 expression and production is induced in T-cells post activation and T-cell PF4 also limits Th17 differentiation. As such we propose the following aims: Aim 1: To demonstrate that PF4 is a major mediator of T-helper differentiation. Aim 2: To demonstrate mechanisms for PF4 inhibition of Th17 differentiation.  Results of our studies will impact many fields of inflammation related research, including transplant immune responses. Great progress has been made in reducing the incidence of acute transplant rejection, but less progress has been made in preventing chronic graft vasculopathy. Our results indicate a novel PF4 mediated pathway that regulates CD4+ T-cell responses to transplantation. These studies will also impact many other fields of inflammation and immune development by demonstrating a mechanism for platelet and T-cell cross-talk that directly affects immune development. We will use genetically modified thrombocytopenic and PF4 deficient mice in a chronic heart transplant model to pursue our novel and impactful studies."
"9388365","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Experience-dependent brain plasticity is heightened during developmental critical periods but declines into adulthood, posing a major challenge to recovery of function following injury or disease later in life. A dominant model of critical period plasticity is the change in ocular dominance of neurons in primary visual cortex following monocular deprivation. Recent studies suggest that experience-dependent plasticity of Parvalbumin positive (PV-) GABA interneurons in visual cortex plays a key role in triggering ocular dominance plasticity during the critical period. Importantly, such rapid plasticity of PV cells is limited to the critical period and is not observed in adults. Our pilot study further showd that another major subtype of interneurons expressing Somatostatin (SST) can also modulate ocular dominance plasticity in the adult. These studies underscore the novel role of interneurons in rapidly gating cortical plasticity in adult visual cortex. However, the molecular and circuit mechanisms that limit the rapid plasticity triggered by interneurons in the adult are totally unknown. This proposal deals with this open question to provide new mechanisms of the initial phase of plasticity to effectively re-trigger plastic windows for recovery of cortical function in adults.  We turn to proteolytic regulation because tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), a major protease in the brain, is known to rapidly elevate during only critical period but not in adulthood to mediate plasticity. Our preliminary study found that the removal of one endogenous tPA inhibitors called Neuroserpin, enriched in adult PV- and SST-cells, leads to a series of experience-dependent rapid changes to unmask plasticity in adult visual cortex.  By combining in vivo extracellular recordings, patch-clamp electrophysiology with optogenetics, pharmacogenetics, and cell-type specific gain/loss of gene expression through genetic and viral techniques in vivo, we will test our hypothesis that proteolytic regulation by an endogenous serine inhibitor, Neuroserpin, gates the sensitivity of PV- and SST- interneurons to rapidly trigger visual cortex plasticity and recovery in adulthood. Proteolytic regulation of rapid plasticty associated with PV-interneurons and SST-interneurons will be examined in Aim1 and Aim2 respectively. In Aim3, therapeutic potential for recovery from amblyopia by targeting Neuroserpin in interneurons will be tested.  Successful completion of this project will illuminate  new molecular mechanism that gates the initial cascade triggering cortical plasticity, which will have direct implications for Amblyopia, a condition with limited adult-applicable cure affecting 2-5% of the human population, but also for brain injury repair, sensory recovery."
"9402109","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Von Willebrand Disease is a commonly diagnosed bleeding disorder that has recently come under scientific scrutiny for being under diagnosed in some groups (menorrhagia) at the same time it may be over diagnosed in others (up to 1-2% of the population). Retrospective studies have been done in the US, Canada, UK, and EU suggesting that the diagnosis of VWD is usually incontrovertible when levels of VWF are less than 30 IU/dL. Frequently, VWD is diagnosed when 1 VWF test is below the normal range (<50 IU/dL). Using the stringent level of 30 IU/dL, 69% of 548 VWD index cases, on restudy did not have reduced VWF:Ag or VWF:RCo. This proposal will study prospectively a large cohort of individuals referred to hematologists at one of 9 participating Centers and study the correlation of local diagnostic testing to central testing on repetitive study over a 5 year period. For the fist 2 years, this testing will be blinded and these results compared to similar testing over the next 2 3 years when there will be unblinded central testing and active quality control program between these institutions. Variant (type 2) VWD is diagnosed in 15-20% of individuals with VWD. New screening tests and a new VWF-phenotyping test will be developed and evaluated in this prospective study. Several quantitative bleeding scores (QBS) have been developed that help to differentiate subjects with VWD from those without VWD, but they have not been utilized to assess actual bleeding risk. Two large cohorts, one adult and one pediatric, will be studied with several QBS and these scores compared to their risk of hemorrhage prospectively. This project proposes to improve the fidelity, cost effectiveness, and sensitivity needed to diagnose VWD"
"9467798","Project Summary/Abstract Approximately 3.6 million breast cancer survivors are living in the US.1 Despite improved survival and relatively low recurrence rates (5-15%),2 the cancer survivorship period is frequently dominated by fear of cancer recurrence (FCR).3 Over half of breast cancer survivors experience moderate to severe levels of FCR,4 with a prevalence of up to 70% among young adults.5 Oncotype Dx, a genomic test analyzing 21 genetic markers of breast cancer tissue, is used to calculate a Recurrence Score (0-100%) to predict the benefit of adjuvant chemotherapy and the likelihood of distant recurrence among patients with early stage, hormone receptor- positive breast cancer.6 Recurrence Scores are divided into three categories of risk: low, intermediate, and high. The associations between Recurrence Score category and FCR, health-related quality of life (HRQOL), psychological distress, anxiety, depression, and perceived risk are poorly understood.7?9 Aligned with NINR?s strategic focus on symptom science and quality of life in individuals with chronic diseases, the proposed study will examine how precision health, in the form of genomic testing, can influence the psychosocial wellbeing and HRQOL of breast cancer survivors. Findings can be used to better understand individual risk for psychosocial sequelae based on genomic risk category and ultimately, to develop personalized symptom interventions to improve HRQOL. Among women with Oncotype Dx testing for stage I ? IIIa hormone receptor-positive breast cancer (? 18 years of age) who have completed adjuvant chemotherapy and are currently on endocrine therapy, the proposed study will: (1) examine the associations between Recurrence Score category (measured by Oncotype Dx: low, intermediate, high) and the primary outcomes, FCR (Concerns about Recurrence Scale (CARS)) and HRQOL (Patient-Reported Outcome Measurement Information System (PROMIS) ? Global Health) and secondary outcomes, psychological distress (Distress Thermometer), anxiety and depression (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS)), and perceived risk (Illness Perception Questionnaire- Revised and 1 item rating perceived risk of recurrence (0-100%)); (2) determine if phenotypic characteristics, including sociodemographic and clinical characteristics (e.g., age, race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status, education, marital status), are associated with FCR; (3) explore potential discordance between FCR and Recurrence Score category; and (4) explore FCR and psychosocial response using semi-structured interviews with a sub-sample of participants drawn from each Recurrence Score category. The proposed study will use an explanatory sequential mixed methods design. The research will take place at the New York University Perlmutter Cancer Center, a large urban NCI-designated cancer center. Participants will be identified by oncology practice health care providers and the PI during routine visits, support groups, and/or other survivorship center activities."
"9393354","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Lymph transport relies critically on the intrinsic contractions of lymphatic smooth muscle (SM) cells in the walls of collecting lymphatic vessels to propel lymph against a hydrostatic pressure gradient. These contractions must be coordinated within each pumping unit, the lymphangion, to efficiently propel lymph downstream to the next segment. Synchronized contractions depend on tight electrical coupling of lymphatic SMCs through connexins (Cx) - gap junction proteins that link adjacent cells and allow the transfer of electrical current. The significance of understanding how contractions are coordinated is underscored by studies suggesting that impaired or uncoordinated lymphatic vessel contractions contribute to both congenital and acquired forms of lymphedema. Notably, women with Cx47 mutations have a higher incidence of breast cancer-related lymphedema of the extremities and patients with Cx47 or Cx43 mutations develop primary lymphedema, reputedly due to a contraction coordination deficit in collecting lymphatic vessels. Little is know about Cx expression and electrical coupling between the cells of the lymphatic wall. A better understanding of how electrical signals are conducted and coordinated within and along the lymphatic wall requires knowledge of the specific Cx isoforms expressed in the SM and endothelial cell (EC) layers as well as direct measures of electrical coupling between the cells. We have recently developed a preparation ideally suited to address these issues: the isolated popliteal lymphatic vessel of the mouse. We can control pressure/flow, measure membrane potential in both SMCs and ECs, and quantitatively assess the degree of cell-cell coupling by passing current between two recording microelectrodes at defined separations. Our preliminary data suggest 1) lymphatic vessels show EC-specific expression of Cx37 and Cx43 but SM-specific expression of Cx45; 2) there is robust EC-EC electrical coupling, good SM-SM coupling, but relatively poor SM-EC coupling. This is in stark contrast to what is found in arterioles. Our central hypothesis is that the lymphatic wall exhibits a high degree of SM-SM electrical coupling between, but not across, valves to allow focal generation, conduction and synchronization of action potentials (APs) within lymphangions; further, we hypothesize that the SM layer is essentially uncoupled electrically from the EC layer, due to poor SM-EC Cx expression, and is optimized to conduct a depolarizing wave rather than a hyperpolarization wave. This hypothesis will be tested by 3 specific aims: 1) Determine the extent of electrical and Cx coupling between SM and EC cells in the lymphatic wall; 2) Determine which cells of the lymphatic wall initiate electrical pacemaking; 3) Determine the factors controlling the direction and conduction of lymphatic pacemaker waves. We will take advantage of GFP reporter mice and global and tissue-specific knock-outs of specific Cx isoforms. Accomplishment of these aims will advance our understanding of how lymphatic contractions are coordinated, enabling potential pharmacological rescue of the dysfunctional lymphatic pump in lymphedema."
"9385710","DESCRIPTION (Provided by applicant):  Despite the advent of effective statin therapies, atherosclerosis remains the leading cause of cardiovascular disease in the United States and worldwide. In addition to the well-known role of cholesterol as a major risk factor contributing to cardiovascular disease, evidence from many laboratories points to two other critical contributory factors, namely, dysregulated inflammation and metabolism. The latter two factors are inter- dependent, and metabolically active cells, in response to excess nutrient input, can generate a low-grade, chronic inflammation, referred to as metaflammation. This concept has become increasingly important as an epidemic of obesity in the Western world is driving the incidence of insulin resistance, diabetes, and athero- sclerosis, and consequent morbidity and mortality. The long-term goal of our Program Project is to gain a deep and mechanistic understanding of the genetic events and cellular and physiological processes underlying the connections between inflammation, metabolism, and atherogenesis. A central hypothesis is that macrophages are critically important early responders to metabolic stress, and that they in turn, by paracrine mechanisms, influence the responses of other cells crucial in metaflammation, particularly adipocytes and endothelial cells.  The specific objectives of this Program are (i) to understand the molecular basis of interleukin-1 receptor/Toll- like receptor-mediated inflammatory responses in macrophages and EC, and delineate their roles in the initiation and pathogenesis of obesity-associated inflammatory disease (Project 1, Dr. Xiaoxia Li), (ii) to utilize mouse genetic, genomic, and proteomic approaches to identify atherosclerosis modifier genes and genetic modifiers of macrophage foam cell lipid droplet metabolism (Project 2, Dr. Jonathan Smith), and (iii) to determine the noncanonical function of glutamyl-prolyl tRNA synthetase (EPRS) as a critical effector of the mTORC1-S6K1 signaling pathway in adipocytes and macrophages, and its contribution to diet-induced obesity and atherosclerosis (Project 3, Dr. Paul Fox). The Project Leaders are a highly integrated and synergistic group employing distinct but complementary approaches, i.e., cell signaling (Li), mouse genetics/genomics/proteomics (Smith), and biochemistry (Fox). Three scientific Cores - Primary Cell and Mouse Metabolism, Atherosclerosis and Lipoprotein Analysis, and Macromolecular Interaction - and an Administration Core provide multi-project support, expertise, and service in a cost-effective manner, significantly strengthening each of the Projects. We anticipate our collaborative effort will lead to the discovery of novel genes, signaling pathways, and macro-molecular interactions that promote or restrict atherogenesis, and that can be leveraged to reduce disease initiation and progression, and support health and longevity."
"9389010","PROJECT SUMMARY Background and Objectives: Synapses and circuits possess a robust capacity for stress response. They employ homeostatic regulatory mechanisms to maintain physiologically appropriate levels of synaptic output. Improved knowledge about homeostatic forms of synaptic plasticity should lead to a better understanding of neurological disorders that occur when synapse stability is lost. Using genetic and electrophysiological approaches at the model Drosophila neuromuscular junction (NMJ) synapse, three new factors required for the long-term homeostatic maintenance of NMJ function were uncov- ered: two tyrosine kinase signaling molecules residing in the muscle and one phospholipase C-? (PLC?) molecule residing in the neuron. The objective of this proposal is to understand how these three molecules integrate cell-cell signaling processes to maintain synapse stability throughout life. Specific Aims and Research Design: This project has three specific aims. The first two aims will delineate how each respective tyrosine kinase drives a muscle-to-nerve signaling process to stabilize synaptic activity over long periods of developmental time. The third aim will address how neuronal PLC? integrates cell-cell signals at the synapse to autonomously control neuronal output. Each aim will combine electrophysiology, genetics, pharmacology, biochemistry, and synapse imaging. A prima- ry assay for each aim will be to challenge NMJ function ? usually by inhibiting glutamate receptors in the muscle ? and then to examine the NMJ by electrophysiology to check if it appropriately responds to that challenge by releasing more glutamate from the neuron. By combining this electrophysiological approach with synapse imaging it will be possible to identify manipulations that specifically impair synapse function ? as opposed to other parameters, like synapse growth. The expected outcome is a detailed model of how synaptic tissues transmit cell-cell signals to maintain stable activity levels. Health Relatedness: Neurological disorders like epilepsy, ataxia, and migraine are associated with unstable neuronal function. Therefore, understanding how synapses work to maintain stability on a molecular level could have profound implications for disorders with underlying neuronal instabilities. Yet the cell-cell signaling events that tightly control levels of synaptic output are poorly understood. The genetically tractable Drosophila NMJ employs homoestatic strategies to stabilize synapse function ? such as altering levels of presynaptic calcium influx ? that are shared by mammalian central synapses. Taking advantage of the molecular and genetic tools offered by the NMJ promises to shed light on universally conserved mechanisms of how synapses maintain stable function throughout life."
"9576389","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This career development award will facilitate the training needed for the principle investigator (PI) to transition to a tenure-track faculty positio and establish an independent research program focused on using developmental biology principles to generate biomimetic constructs for regenerative craniofacial therapy. The ultimate goal of this research is to engineer customized, multi-tissue structures to replace dental tissues. Tissue-engineered constructs could restore function and aesthetics to patients suffering from trauma, congenital defects, and disease to the craniofacial region. However, the craniofacial region comprises complex, multi-tissue structures that are challenging to recreate using traditional tissue engineering methods due to difficulties in directing correct spatial organizatio and producing proper interfaces. During natural tissue development, cell migration and the expression of morphogen gradients are two critical components of tissue patterning; understanding and controlling these processes is key for improving tissue engineering design. The PI will acquire training to study and manipulate cell migration and the expression of morphogen gradients to investigate mechanisms facilitating the formation of organized multi-tissue structures in engineered tissues and to customize tissue patterning. The PI has previously shown that forming novel three-dimensional, scaffold-free tissue-engineered constructs (SFC) from dental pulp cells (DPC) results in spatially organized dentin-pulp complex-like structures containing a pulp-like core enclosed within a dentin-like periphery. In Aim 1, the PI will receive training in advanced imaging techniques to track cell migration within 3D tissues. The hypothesis that in SFCs generated from the total population of dental pulp cells, the CD146+ stem/progenitor cells migrate to the periphery to produce the outer dentin-like tissue will be tested. In Aim 2, the PI will acquire training in microfluidic devices to generate molecular gradients across SFCs to alter tissue patterning. Gradients of calcium and transforming growth factor ?1, known factors involved in odontogenic differentiation, will be generated across the SFCs to test the hypothesis that a dentin-like structure will form in in the highest concentrations of the chemical gradients and transition to a pulp-like tissue. As an independent investigator the PI will use the training received in Aim 1 to track stem/progenitor cell migration in SFCs in response to the molecular gradients generated by the microfluidic devices. In Aim 3, as an independent investigator, the PI will generate a cementum-like tissue layer on the outer surface of the dentin-pulp complex-like SFC. SFCs generated by DPCs will be wrapped with a periodontal ligament stem/progenitor cell (PDLC) sheet to test the hypothesis that PDLC will differentiate towards a cementoblast phenotype when spatially positioned on an outer surface of a dentin-pulp complex-like structure. Additionally, using the training received in Aim 2, microfluidic devices will be used to generate gradients of bone morphogenic protein 2 or insulin-like growth factor 1, known inducers of cementoblast differentiation, across the SFCs to alter cementum patterning."
"9390060","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is a renewal application for a SCHOOL-WIDE predoctoral training program, which was initiated in 2003. It is designed to train six graduate students annually in the field of Cardiovascular Biology. Cardiovascular diseases are major causes of mortality and morbidity in the United States, and thus require major efforts in fundamental and translational research. The training program offers a format for training students dedicated to developing the tools and knowledge needed to study and control cardiovascular disease. It provides formal research and academic training for Ph.D. and M.D.-Ph.D. candidates carefully selected from interested candidates who are already students at Boston University. Trainees enter the program after passing their qualifying exams, and are supported by the fellowship for an average of 2 years. The program's major goal is to encourage competent young scientists to pursue their interest in cardiovascular research, and prepare them for careers in biomedical research. The objectives are: 1) to provide a thorough understanding of clinical implications as well as basic mechanisms; 2) to facilitate interdisciplinary and collaborative approaches to cardiovascular disease; 3) to expose trainees to a broad range of current technologies; and 4) to provide professional development and career exploration opportunities. Training is offered in topics such as atherosclerosis, heart failure and hypertension, with application of various disciplines ranging from physiology to biochemistry to genetics to biomolecular engineering, thus broadening our trainees' knowledge during regular group meetings and Journal Clubs. Interdisciplinary training is further facilitated by coursework and participation in activities offered by the relatively new Evans Center for Interdisciplinary Biomedical Research (founded in 2009). To balance knowledge of clinical relevance, basic mechanisms, and technical innovations, each PhD thesis committee must include 2 members of the training program faculty, at least one with a Ph.D. and one with an M.D. Additional training activities include: participation in various activities of the Whitaker Cardiovascular Institute (CI) at our institute, attendance at clinical cardiology forums and grand rounds, and required courses in cardiovascular biology. Members of the training faculty are experienced mentors affiliated with different academic departments and with the CVI, and all have at least one active NIH grant. There are strong research interactions between members of the training program, which are further strengthened by the trainees. Although this is a relatively young program, we have already trained twenty-seven graduate students, all of whom have documented success in research and academic skills. The program may be unique in that it provides an opportunity to train predoctoral fellows in cardiovascular research with emphasis on interdisciplinary approaches, in an academic setting with considerable experience, cutting-edge funded research in cardiovascular biology, and where sensitivity to the needs of graduate students is provided by a well-developed mentoring program, addressing issues from time management to professional development."
"9380970","Summary: Through high quality curation we aim to integrate the wealth of Xenopus data into a single easily accessible computer framework that accelerates research, and facilitates the translation of this large amount of information into meaningful knowledge. The data in Xenbase must be comprehensive, accurate and up to date. Xenbase contains many different data types including; genomes and gene models, DNA, RNA and protein sequences, gene names and symbols, gene expression patterns, gene function, anatomy, orthology, reagents (MOs and antibodies), investigator information, phenotypes and disease associations. This data comes from the published literature, direct community submissions and from other databases (e.g. NCBI, JGI, OMIM). In order for the information in Xenbase to be computer readable, we index and annotate data using ontologies and standardized procedures that are the accepted best practices as shared across major model organism databases (MODs). This allows Xenopus data to be compared to other animals and to human disease gene and phenotypes. The majority of the curation effort is to read and annotate the published Xenopus literature. Xenbase contains a corpus of ~46,000 Xenopus papers, mirroring PubMed, but to date only about 10% of these have been curated, primarily for gene expression patterns. Preliminary analysis indicate that ~11,000 uncurated papers are likely to contain valuable high priority data and about 1,300 new Xenopus papers are published each year. In the Curation Component we will annotate this Xenopus research data."

"9443153","SUMMARY Our research goal is to determine the regulatory mechanisms controlling the function of Ewing sarcoma fusion proteins during induction of mitotic dysfunction, chromosomal instability (CIN), and ultimately in the pathogenesis of Ewing sarcoma, a pediatric bone cancer. Ewing sarcoma cells express aberrant EWS/FLI1 fusion protein, derived by chromosomal translocation, and this leads to impaired target gene expression through altered transcription and splicing. In addition to these mechanisms, we previously identified a novel function of EWS/FLI1 which leads to mitotic dysfunction through interaction with EWS and inhibition of EWS activity. Our study demonstrated that EWS regulates mitosis through interaction with Aurora B kinase (Aurora B), and through recruitment of Aurora B to the midzone, a midline structure that is located between segregating chromosomes. Disruption of EWS-Aurora B interaction by EWS/FLI1 protein may be a contributing factor in the development of Ewing sarcoma, because compromised Aurora B-relocation leads to defects in cytokinesis, missegregation of chromosomes, and ultimately, to induction of CIN.  The mechanisms that modulate EWS/FLI1 activity during the induction of mitotic dysfunction and CIN are unknown. One possible regulatory mechanism is post-translational modification (PTM), and a previous study showed that EWS and EWS/FLI1 undergo O-GlcNAcylation, a form of PTM wherein a single ?-N- acetylglucosamine sugar is attached to Ser or Thr residues. We therefore chose to investigate O-GlcNAcylation as a potential regulatory mechanism for EWS/FLI1-dependent mitotic dysfunction. Our previous study demonstrated that elevated cellular O-GlcNAc levels induce midzone formation defects in HeLa cells. Because EWS forms homodimers, and EWS/FLI1 interaction with EWS disrupts its mitotic function, we hypothesize that O-GlcNAcylation of EWS/FLI1 induces midzone dysfunction by enabling the fusion protein to form a stable dimer with EWS. We will utilize an EWS/FLI1 construct containing a point mutation at the proposed critical O-GlcNAcylation site in human cells (HeLa and Ewing sarcoma A673 cells), to investigate our hypothesis, by addressing the following specific aim. Specific Aim 1: To determine how O-GlcNAcylation of EWS/FLI1 and EWS affects the induction of CIN.  In addition to EWS/FLI1 in Ewing sarcoma, EWS is fused to different genes in other types of sarcomas, and the resulting EWS-fusion genes are thought to be responsible for transformation. The significance of this study is that impairment of mitosis by O-GlcNAcylation of EWS-fusion proteins may be a universal mechanism for pathogenesis in all sarcomas expressing EWS-fusion genes. Thus, our study may supply a platform for understanding the molecular mechanism regulating all EWS-fusion gene derived sarcomas. 1"
"9412029","Project Summary: All present day prosthetic heart valves suffer from complications. Mechanical heart valves (HVs) require life-long anti-coagulation therapy, while bioprosthetic heart valves based on fixed tissue are plagued with durability, immunogenic and calcification issues. Superomniphobic (SO) bileaflet mechanical heart valves with vortex generator (VG) technology promise to eliminate the need for anti-coagulation therapy. Our lab has developed a SO bileaflet mechanical heart valve (BMHV) with VGs that drastically improve surface hemocompatibility as well as eliminate turbulent stresses, thus reducing platelet activation. Preliminary work has shown that SO surfaces remarkably reduced thrombogenic potential relative to plain pyrolytic carbon leaflets. Further, we have already demonstrated the feasibility of manufacturing BMHVs and assembling them with VGs into an implantable BMHV. The present R21 study aims to gauge the efficacy of SO BMHV with VG as a potential alternative to current heart valve technology by fine tuning material composition and processing to meet the durability and antithrombogenic requirements for heart valves. Our central hypothesis is: superomniphobic BMHVs with vortex generator flow control technology will be superior to current BMHVs in terms of hemodynamic performance, blood damage, and blood-material surface compatibility while exhibiting satisfactory durability. This is tested in two aims. Aim 1 quantifies heart valve hemodynamic performance of SO with VG BMHVs to identify the ideal SO+VG configuration for superior hemodynamics and minimum blood damage. Aim 2 focuses on elucidating the effects of leaflet composition and processing on hemocompatibility while optimizing the strength and hemocompatibility of the coating. This proposal is led by Dr. Lakshmi Prasad Dasi, who is a well trained young investigator with expertise in heart valve engineering and cardiovascular biomechanics, and inventor of several heart valve technologies including VGs and novel biomolecule polymer leaflets. Multi-PIs are Dr. Kota, who is an established superhydrophobic materials expert; Dr. Popat whose expertise lies in bio-compatibility and surface nano-engineering. If the proposed work demonstrates that SO with VG BMHVs elicit excellent hemodynamics, and are durable, this R21 grant may lead to breakthrough technology for mechanical HVs and all other blood contacting devices (e.g. artificial hearts, LVADs etc.) that require little or no anticoagulation."
"9415441","Summary ? Neuroblastoma is the most common extracranial tumor in childhood, with poor clinical outcomes for high-risk patients using systemic, multi-drug chemotherapy followed by surgical resection. There is a strong clinical need for new approaches to chemotherapy administration due to poor outcomes and secondary organ toxicities with long-term negative consequences particularly in children. The goal of this proposal is to develop focal drug delivery systems that can be applied within the tumor or over a post-resection tumor bed. The hypothesis is that local delivery coupled with sustained drug release using silk protein-based biomaterial sponges and films (implantable) or gels (injectable) will provide new therapeutic strategies for high-risk neuroblastoma patients while reducing systemic side effects. We will build upon our extensive prior experience and success using silk biomaterials for sustained drug release to optimize local tumor treatment while minimizing the impact on healthy tissue. This will include targeting tumor drug concentration to match or exceed clinical blood levels on a sustained basis, as well as exploiting directional diffusion to further improve targeting to the tumor site versus healthy tissue. The focus will be on delivering cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents (doxorubicin, vincristine, etoposide-4'-phosphate, cisplatin) in both single and dual drug-loaded delivery systems using silk biomaterials. These silk delivery systems will be assessed in vitro for impact on neuroblastoma cell lines and in vivo using an orthotopic tumor models generated from neuroblastoma cell lines and patient-derived xenografts. Drug release kinetics and toxicity will be assessed in the animal models to assess the impact of local drug release on tumor growth as well as pharmacokinetics and toxicity in tissue compartments. All studies are supported by extensive preliminary data and represent a collaborative team consisting of a bioengineer (Kaplan) with expertise with the biomaterials and drug delivery and a physician (Chiu) who focuses on neuroblastoma treatments.

"9429544","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The anterior segment of the eye comprises structures essential for vision and overall ocular health. Anterior segment dysgenesis (ASD) refers to a broad spectrum of eye diseases that occur when these structures do not form appropriately during fetal development. Children born with ASD can exhibit iris hypoplasia, misplaced pupils, hazy corneas, and corneal-iris adhesions. In addition, because the tissues responsible for intraocular pressure (IOP) regulation reside in the anterior segment, ASD is commonly associated with a severe form of childhood glaucoma - a progressive blinding disease for which increased IOP is the leading risk factor. Though early malformation of the anterior segment is known to result in a variety of eye disorders, the specific mechanisms underlying its proper development remain largely unidentified. Recent data has implicated both Notch and Bone Morphogenic Protein (BMP) signaling in the formation of the ciliary body, the site of aqueous fluid production. Specifically, in mice deficient for the Notch2 receptor, BMP signaling was significantly diminished and the ciliary body failed to develop. Furthermore, preliminary evidence suggests that these pathways may also be involved in development of the iridocorneal angle, a region involved in fluid drainage comprised of the trabecular meshwork and Schlemm's canal. The experiments proposed below will test the overarching hypothesis that Notch signaling acts upstream of BMP signaling in the development of anterior segment structures important for IOP regulation. Using mouse gain and loss of function alleles, I will examine the morphogenesis of the ciliary body and iridocorneal angle following perturbation of key proteins within the pathways of interest. In addition, I will assess the long-term effects of ASD on ocular physiology in adult mice. This work will define the temporal and spatial requirements of the Notch and BMP signaling pathways during the formation and later maintenance of important anterior eye structures. Results from these studies will ultimately provide fundamental insight into the developmental biology regulating anterior segment development, as well as identify molecular targets that may prove valuable in treating children with ASD."
"9388370","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Tolerance of kidney allografts has been achieved in non-human primates (NHPs) and in humans using a combination of non-myeloablative conditioning and donor bone marrow transplantation (DMBT) that results in transient donor chimerism. However, until now, mixed-chimerism protocols that achieve long-term tolerance of kidney allografts in NHPs have consistently failed to induce tolerance in recipients of heart or lung allografts. It is well known that some organs, such as kidney and liver, are tolerance-prone while others, such as heart and lung, are tolerance-resistant. It has been hypothesized that only protocols that result in durable donor chimerism would be able to achieve tolerance in resistant heart and lung allografts. Remarkably, however, the results obtained during our current funding cycle demonstrate, for the first time, that tolerance of heart allografts can be achieved in NHPs via transient mixed-chimerism as long as host regulatory mechanisms are enhanced in the host. Indeed, our results suggest that it is the ability of a mixed-chimerism protocol to augment or expand regulatory T cells (Tregs), rather than its durability, that determines its ability to induc tolerance to resistant organs. Thus, the unifying goal of this program project is to combine mixed chimerism with novel strategies designed to amplify the contributions of Tregs in order develop a clinical tolerance protocol that can be rapidly translated to human recipients of heart and lung allografts. The Program will be organized in such a way that early advances in Project 3 (examining molecular pathways required to stabilize and promote Treg function in mice), will inform and refine the aims of Project 1 (optimizing mixed chimerism to induce NHP heart allograft tolerance) and Project 2 (optimizing mixed chimerism to induce NHP lung allograft tolerance). The availability of tissue and blood samples for longitudinal analyses will aid the study of immune mechanisms by assessing the consequences of T and B cell regulation, T and B cell memory and pro-inflammatory cytokines on graft survival (Cores A & B). The diverse yet complementary models and approaches that will be used to achieve heart and lung tolerance is a unique strength of this program project. Collaboration between all projects will be greatly enhanced by the fact that most all the investigators have worked together closely for many years. Together, our studies should result in a better understanding of tolerance and contribute to the successful application of tolerance to the full spectrum of deceased donor organ and tissue transplantation."
"9391699","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite aggressive current guideline-driven therapies, coronary artery disease (CAD) patients remain at increased risk of cardiovascular events, possibly because conventional treatments do not adequately address some of the inflammatory pathways implicated in the disease. Anti- inflammatory strategies have been associated with lower cardiovascular event rates in individuals with inflammatory autoimmune disease and are appealing in more general CAD populations but are not currently used in practice because of the lack of an established and easily obtained measure of the effect of inflammation on the processes which result in coronary atherosclerosis and because no clinical trial has established whether an anti-inflammatory strategy, per se, alters these processes. Inflammation contributes to the process of coronary endothelial dysfunction which plays a pivotal role in the development, progression, and clinical manifestations of CAD, and is a marker for sub-clinical disease, an independent predictor of adverse cardiovascular events, and a potential target for medical interventions. We recently developed noninvasive, reproducible MRI-based methods to measure CEF. We propose a 2x2 blinded, placebo-controlled trial to test the hypothesis that anti-inflammatory approaches, namely very low dose methotrexate (VLDM), low dose colchicine (LDC) and/or their combination, improve impaired local CEF in stable CAD patients with increased markers of inflammation on conventional cardiovascular medications. The studies will provide novel much- needed mechanistic insight into the potential of anti-inflammatory strategies to reduce coronary endothelial dysfunction, which inflammatory biomarkers herald the CEF response, and whether a heterogeneous coronary response occurs with differential effects in more severely than mildly diseased coronary vessels, suggesting local anti-inflammatory effects. In addition to this novel mechanistic information, the findings with these clinically available drugs will guide the next generation of clinical outcome trials and can be rapidly translated to practice."

In this project, studies will be undertaken using research colonies of dogs affected by such hereditary retinal diseases to better understand the genetic and pathogenetic mechanisms of the diseases, and evaluate potential methods of disease prevention, therapy or amelioration.  Specific canine strains with well characterized retinal disorders will be maintained and bred at a centralized resource facility Mutant and age-matched control dogs will be made available to research investigators either for independent or collaborative studies aimed at understanding the molecular mechanisms involved in the diseases, and developing potential therapies that can be evaluated on a short- or long-term basis. In parallel, this centralized resource will be used by multiple investigators to accomplish the research goals of their own NIH funded grants. Lastly, hypothesis driven studies by the PI and collaborators will identify new patient-relevant retinal disease models, examine the cellular/molecular mechanisms resulting in photoreceptor cell death, survival or proliferation, and develop interventions that will modulate the diseases, and develop therapies targeted for late-stage retinal disease with an emphasis on promoter selection and combinatorial therapies adjunctive to gene augmentation. The proposed studies provide support for the principal hypothesis that collaborative research using these canine models, from a centralized well maintained resource colony, and with an experienced team of investigators will lead to critical proof of principle studies directed at developing safe and effective novel therapies for human retinal degenerations."
"9380965","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Skin melanocytes and other pigment-producing cells accomplish their main physiological task of melanin biosynthesis inside highly specialized compartments known as melanosomes. Melanosomes belong to a group of functionally specialized, cell-type-specific organelles that are derived from the endosomal-lysosomal system and known as lysosome-related organelles (LROs). Defective melanosome biogenesis underlies several forms of oculocutaneous albinism, with its typical manifestations in skin (reduced tanning ability, increased risk of developing skin cancer) and eyes (reduced visual acuity, nystagmus), often as part of syndromes - such as Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome (HPS) - that also include clinical manifestations caused by defective biogenesis of other LROs. The short-term goal of this project is to understand the functional specialization of selected components of the molecular machinery for protein trafficking in the endosomal-lysosomal system of most cell types, such that these components can also mediate the biogenesis of cell-type-specific LROs such as melanosomes. For example, genetic defects in some of the genes encoding ubiquitously expressed subunits of Adaptor Protein (AP)-3 and Biogenesis of Lysosome-related Organelles Complex (BLOC)-1 cause various forms of HPS. In the first Specific Aim, we will characterize some poorly understood molecular determinants for AP-3 and BLOC-1 function in melanosome biogenesis. In the second Specific Aim, we will characterize novel components of this molecular machinery. In the third Specific Aim, we will attempt to define the existence of novel LROs in other cell types."

"9404487","Inhaled nicotine abuse either from tobacco cigarette or e-cigarette smoking is one of the most important risk factors in development of cardiovascular disease. Recent studies in women and animal models indicate that cigarette smoking or nicotine use by mothers during pregnancy increases the risk of hypertension and cardiovascular diseases in offspring. Oxidative stress has been implicated in the etiology of many diseases with substantial public health impact including chronic cardiovascular disorders and preeclampsia. Our recent studies in pregnant rats have demonstrated that perinatal nicotine exposure causes a development of vascular dysfunctional phenotype associated with an increased vascular specific NADPH oxidase (NOX2) gene expression and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in adult offspring. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying nicotine-mediated programming of vascular oxidative stress are unclear. In addition, whether the heightened oxidative stress contributes to development of hypertensive phenotype remains undetermined. Recently, our research team has developed a non-invasive method delivering nicotine to rodents through inhalation with lung alveolar region-targeted aerosol technology (patent No. 61/418,304) that enables rapid delivery of adequate and controllable amount of nicotine into the circulation. This method closely resembles the route and both the arterial and venous blood nicotine kinetics of smoking a cigarette in human, and induces dose-dependent pharmacological effects in rodents. Our previous data show that chronic intermittent nicotine aerosol treatment (CINA) to rats produces circadian blood pharmacokinetics resembling chronic smokers. Therefore, in this proposed studies we will use the unique CINA pregnant rat model to test the central hypothesis that antenatal exposure to maternal inhaled nicotine programs vascular oxidative stress via epigenetic up-regulation of NOX2 gene, resulting in a hypertensive phenotype in offspring. Our working Specific Aim 1 will determine nicotine pharmacokinetics (PK) in CINA inhaled pregnant rats with our novel alveolar region-targeted aerosol technology and adjust the parameters of aerosol generation/exposure to simulate the PK of human chronic smokers. Specific Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that antenatal inhaled nicotine programs of vascular oxidative stress via epigenetic up-regulation of NOX2 expression. Specific Aim 3 will test the hypothesis that antenatal inhaled nicotine causes a development of hypertensive phenotype which is regulated by NOX2-related ROS signaling. The proposed studies will resolve whether maternal inhaled nicotine during pregnancy programs fetal oxidative stress and contributes to the development of hypertensive phenotype in adulthood. Innovative approaches in these studies provide the opportunity to identify epigenetic biomarkers during early life that have diagnostic and preventive value to the consequences of in utero adverse environmental exposure-induced cardiovascular disease in adulthood."
"9386093","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the largest single contributor to global mortality and appears to dominate mortality trends in the future. New evidence is emerging that inflammation attributable to monocytes/macrophages contributes to the development of CVD. Traditional CVD risk factors, such as insulin resistance, hyperlipidemia, and smoking, have been associated with modification of epigenetic markers and signatures of epigenetic dysregulation can be detected in peripheral blood samples. Monocytes (CD14+CD16+) residing in peripheral blood from dialysis patients predicted cardiovascular disease incidence, implicating this cell type in disease pathology. Indeed, an increased percentage of CD14+CD16+ monocytes were observed in the blood of patients with coronary heart disease. An increased percentage of these monocytes were also observed in the blood of HIV+ patients. Data from our collaborators indicate that monocytes from persons with HIV infection are hyper-responsive to oxidized LDL or LPS, producing high levels of IL-1?, IL6 and IL8. Thus, HIV-mediated immune activation in monocytes may play a role in the development of CVD. In support of this link, our preliminary data demonstrate that monocytes from HIV+ individuals, who have an elevated risk for CVD, also exhibit hyper-responsiveness to inflammatory stimuli. Interestingly, we observed that the level of a specific epigenetic mark, DNA methylation, at the promoter region of a pro- inflammatory gene in part explained the varying degree to which monocytes from individuals with clinically determined low or high risk for CVD responded to inflammatory stimuli. The mechanistic link between monocyte inflammation and CVD risk may be fundamental, but more easily detectable in individuals with heightened inflammatory response, such as those infected with HIV. This proposal will therefore test the hypothesis that a heightened inflammatory response elicited by monocytes confers an increased risk to CVD due to epigenetic dysregulation of environmentally labile loci, including at pro-inflammatory genes. This may be independent of HIV infection status. To address this hypothesis, we aim to evaluate monocyte inflammatory response in banked blood specimens from HIV-infected and matched uninfected individuals selected based on clinical parameters of CVD risk, and characterize, compare, and integrate this data with genome-wide DNA methylation and gene expression profiles from these monocytes. Collectively, this unique clinical, immunological, and epigenomic database will allow us to identify novel biomarkers associated with CVD risk that may enable improved risk stratification strategies for cardiovascular disease.

"9385312","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Taenia solium is the most common parasitic infection of the central nervous system and a leading cause of acquired epilepsy in low and middle income countries. Endemic transmission occurs primarily in rural areas where pigs are allowed to roam and consume human feces, thus risking contamination with T. solium eggs and subsequent infection with larval cysts (cysticercosis). Identification and treatment of adult tapeworm carriers (taeniasis) who shed eggs into the environment is therefore critical to control strategy. In our previous NIH R21 award we demonstrated that targeted screening for taeniasis in household clusters surrounding infected pigs (ring-screening) identifies tapeworm carriers for treatment and significantly reduces community transmission of the parasite. This strategy involves identifying heavily-infected pigs through tongue examination followed by thorough investigation for the source tapeworm among residents in neighboring households. Our long-term goals are 1) to develop effective, affordable and sustainable strategies for T. solium control in endemic areas, and 2) to increase population-based research capacity for neurologic disorders in rural Peru. The first aim of this R01 proposal is to refine ring-screening strategy so that it can be implemented in control programs. We propose a community trial with five parallel study arms to evaluate the long-term efficacy, cost- effectiveness and acceptability of ring-screening for control of T. solium compared against mass treatment. Additional methods for evaluation include use of portable ultrasound and rapid-diagnostic serologic assays to identify heavily-infected pigs in the field, and presumptive treatment within rings (ring-treatment) as a potential alternative to ring-screening. We will enroll communities totaling approximately 10,000 residents and 6,000 pigs in studies which range from 2 to 4 years in duration. Our second aim is to increase the local capacity for planning, developing and operating neuroepidemiologic studies in rural northern Peru. We will train two PhD candidates in advanced quantitative methods at Johns Hopkins University Bloomberg School of Public Health, as well as 4 Masters level candidates in research-related disciplines at Universidad Cayetano Peruana Heredia in Lima over the 5-year award period. The results of our combined research and training programs will provide tools, methods and capacitation necessary to enable scale-up of the most promising control strategies we identify."
"9406501","ABSTRACT Supplemental oxygen (hyperoxia) with/without continuous nasal positive airway pressure (CPAP) to preterm infants is associated with airway hyperreactivity (AHR) proceeding to wheezing and asthma. Understanding mechanisms by which hyperoxia and CPAP induce sustained AHR represents our long-term goal, and an unmet clinical need. We propose the initial stretch imposed by CPAP on more compliant bronchial airways in premature infants, particularly with added hyperoxia, is contributory. AHR involves greater [Ca2+]i and contractility of airway smooth muscle (ASM), and remodeling mediated partly by ASM proliferation. Our published studies and preliminary work using human fetal airway cells and neonatal mouse models show moderate hyperoxia (50% O2) and mechanical stretch not only enhance ASM contractility and proliferation, but also bronchial epithelial arginase, raising the question of whether and how epithelial arginase and neonatal AHR are linked. We propose the novel and intriguing idea that arginase-derived polyamines (e.g. spermine) have downstream effects on a novel ASM target: extracellular Ca2+ sensing receptor (CaSR). Although well-known for regulating body Ca2+, there is limited information on CaSR in lung, and none in postnatal airways. Preliminary data in developing human airways show high expression of ASM CaSR that responds to extracellular Ca2+ ([Ca2+]o) or spermine, and enhances [Ca2+]I, contractility and proliferation. Hyperoxia and stretch each increase CaSR expression and function. In neonatal mice exposed to 50% O2 and/or CPAP which show sustained AHR, epithelial arginase and ASM CaSR are increased, while inhibitors of arginase (nor-NOHA) and CaSR (calcilytic NPS2143) blunt AHR. Our overall hypothesis is that the epithelial arginase-ASM CaSR axis contributes to AHR in the context of hyperoxia and CPAP exposure in prematurity. We will examine this idea via 3 Aims. Aim 1: In developing bronchial epithelium, determine the effect of hyperoxia and/or stretch on the arginase pathway; Aim 2: In developing ASM, determine the role of CaSR in enhanced [Ca2+]i/contractility and proliferation induced by hyperoxia and/or stretch; Aim 3: In neonatal mouse models of hyperoxia and/or CPAP exposure, determine the role of the arginase-CaSR axis in AHR and airway remodeling. 18-22 week human fetal bronchial epithelial cells (fBECs) and ASM cells (fASM) are exposed to hyperoxia (<60% O2) +/- 0-15% stretch (representing 0 to high CPAP) with continuous 5% oscillations, mimicking clinical hyperoxia +/- CPAP in spontaneously breathing premies. fBEC arginase pathway and downstream effects (Aim 1), and role of fASM CaSR in [Ca2+]i/contractility and proliferation following hyperoxia +/- stretch (Aim 2) are examined, with signaling pathways such as RhoA/Rho kinase and MAPKs. In Aim 3, airway structural, functional and molecular changes are assessed in neonatal WT and smooth muscle CaSR KO mice exposed to 50% O2 +/- intermittent CPAP (3, 6, 9 cmH2O) for 7 days, with 14 days recovery (mimicking human conditions). Effects of inhibiting arginase (nor-NOHA) vs. CaSR (NPS2143) are tested towards establishing clinical significance."
"9385705","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Vaccination with MHC-II restricted ApoB100 peptides to prevent atherosclerosis. Atherosclerosis is a chronic inflammatory disease of large and medium-sized arteries triggered by elevated levels of low density lipoprotein (LDL). Recent evidence shows that both innate and adaptive immune responses contribute to the disease. Using an in vitro screening assay, we found 34 peptides from mouse apolipoprotein (Apo)B100 that bind major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-II (I-Ab in Apoe-/- mice) with high affinity and tested 5 of them in vivo. We discovered that vaccination with I-Ab-binding ApoB100 peptides is strongly atheroprotective in the Apoe-/- mouse model of atherosclerosis. The reductions of atherosclerotic lesion size are associated with increased IL-10 expression in the aortas of vaccinated mice. Since we find elevated IL-10 in aortas of vaccinated mice, we hypothesize that immunization with ApoB100 peptides induces IL-10-producing Tregs and/or IL-10-producing macrophages. Specific aim 1 is to test which cell type is responsible for IL-10 production in aortas of vaccinated mice. We have crossed Apoe-/- mice to IL-10 reporter mice to identify the IL-10-producing cells. Cell type-specific IL-10 knockout mice (Il10fl/fl x LysM-Cre or x FoxP3- Cre) will identify the relevance of this proposed mechanism. Based on preliminary data, we hypothesize that Tregs afford protection from atherosclerosis. Specific aim 2 is to test the role o regulatory T cells (Tregs) in atheroprotection by ApoB100 peptides. We propose to define the antigen-specific CD4 T cells by surface phenotype and cytokine secretion, test their homing to atherosclerotic mouse aortas and study their interaction with dendritic cells (DCs) in atherosclerotic plaque by live cell multiphoton imaging. Based on preliminary data identifying 30 human ApoB100 peptides that bind many alleles of human MHC-II, we propose that ApoB100-based atheroprotective vaccination strategies are translatable to humans. Specific aim 3 is to translate atheroprotective vaccination to humans. We discovered one peptide that is human-to-mouse ApoB100 sequence-identical and binds to many human MHC-II alleles including DRB1*0101. We will test the effect of this sequence-identical ApoB100 peptide on atherosclerosis in existing mice transgenic for DRB1*0101, optimize vaccination regimens (adjuvant, frequency, dose) and evaluate the potential of tetramers and peptide- specific antibodies as biomarkers reporting successful vaccination. When the proposed work is completed, we will know (1) the role of IL-10 in vaccination-induced atheroprotection (2) the role of Tregs in atheroprotection and the mechanism of their homing and maintenance in the aorta and (3) whether this approach is indeed practical and translatable to humans. We already have an in vitro screening assay and propose to develop biomarkers to test for successful vaccination. Ultimately, a safe and effective atherosclerosis vaccine could have a very large national and world-wide public health impact."
"9426105","ABSTRACT  Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is a major autoimmune disease that poses significant problems to afflicted individuals, the development of effective therapeutic interventions, and public health initiatives at large. Initiated and perpetuated by a complex interplay of genetic and environmental risk factors, insulin-secreting pancreatic beta- cells are progressively destroyed by aberrant immune responses leading to elevated blood glucose levels as well as serious disturbances of protein, fat and carbohydrate metabolism. Currently, no cure or effective prevention is available, and despite insulin treatment, serious long-term complications are frequent.  Much of the progress in T1D research attained over the past four decades comes from the study of animal models yet despite many insights generated, a genuine appreciation of the human disease requires better knowledge about pathological processes unfolding directly in the human pancreas. The pursuit of this goal, however, faces two major challenges: the difficulty to obtain suitable tissues from pre/diabetic donors; and the fact that pertinent pathological alterations are often mild and distributed in a variegated fashion across the pancreas. Thus, information obtainable by traditional analysis of individual pancreatic tissue sections is limited. In the present proposal, which constitutes a direct continuation of our previously NIH-funded work on pancreatic histopathology, we will address these challenges by leveraging the resources of the Network of Pancreatic Organ Donors with Diabetes (nPOD) tissue repository together with the recent development or adaptation of two novel, highly multiplexed tissue staining technologies, and with the combined expertise and long-standing interactions of the von Herrath and Homann laboratories. This particular constellation of resources, technologies and experience allows us to tackle two critical knowledge gaps in specific: the detailed in situ phenotypes, functionalities, and interactions of major immune and endocrine cell populations in the pre/diabetic pancreas; and the contribution of specific cytokine signatures to as revealed in these cells to the hyperexpression of MHC-I, a histopathognomonic feature of T1D.  Accordingly, we have developed a research plan that employs high-dimensional multiplexing strategies to interrogate the precise phenotype, activation status, contextual microanatomical localization and distribution of CD8+ and CD4+T cells, antigen presenting cells and B cells, and endocrine cells across the pre/diabetic human pancreas (Aim 1), and that will correlate major cytokine expression patterns (type 1 interferons, IFN?, TNF?) and functional signatures with their cellular sources and targets as potential causes for MHC-I hyperexpression (Aim 2). Moreover, by conducting the work with tissue specimens from the same donors using two different multiplexing technologies in two different laboratories, we seek to achieve robustness and reproducibility of experimental readouts. Altogether, we propose that an integrated analysis of up to 30 phenotypic, functional and topological parameters will define spatiotemporal pathogenetic landmarks that will permit a partial reconstruction of the highly dynamic in situ autoimmune processes operative in T1D disease. Mapping the histopathological landscape of the pre/diabetic human pancreas in exquisite detail not only is important for our conception of disease pathogenesis but ultimately may inform the development of novel or improved prevention strategies and treatment modalities."
"9393352","PROJECT SUMMARY Intensity is a key factor when considering the dose of physical activity (PA) required to achieve specific health and fitness outcomes. The intensity of aerobic PA can be defined either in terms of absolute intensity or relative intensity. Absolute intensity refers to the energy or work required to perform an activity and does not take into account the exercise capacity of the individual. Relative intensity takes into account or adjusts for a person's exercise capacity. For many obese and/or unfit adults, it may not be possible to achieve moderate- intensity PA as measured on an absolute scale due to their low exercise capacity. However, these adults may be able to perform moderate-intensity PA on a relative scale. There is limited evidence regarding the dose of relative intensity PA necessary to promote and maintain health. Addressing this question has important implications regarding how individuals should monitor their PA intensity, how physicians should prescribe PA, and how exercise interventions should be designed. One reason for the limited amount of evidence on the relationship between relative intensity PA and health is the fact that it is difficult to measure relative intensity. As a result, nearly all large prospective observational studies measure PA intensity on an absolute scale. Wearable monitors (accelerometers) are widely used in both epidemiological and clinical research studies for capturing objective estimates of PA without a large participant burden. These devices convert body movement into derived accelerometer ?counts? and there are several published thresholds or cut-points for classifying PA intensity on an absolute scale based on counts. The Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study is an ongoing cohort study of 5,115 African American and White men and women aged 18-30 at baseline in 1985-1986. In 2005-2006, an ancillary CARDIA Fitness Study was performed on 2,760 participants aged 38 to 50 who wore accelerometers during a standardized graded exercise treadmill test and for 1 week of normal activity. Participants were subsequently re-examined in 2010-2011 and 2015-2016 to measure the development of cardiovascular disease risk factors. Using data from the CARDIA study, we will develop and validate statistical methods for objectively measuring relative intensity PA using accelerometry. Our specific aims are: 1) Develop statistical methods for calculating relative-intensity PA accelerometer cut- points and apply these methods to data from the CARDIA exercise treadmill test; 2) Use the CARDIA data to estimate the relationship between relative-intensity PA and the development of cardiometabolic disease as compared to absolute-intensity PA. 3) Investigate the generalizability of our methodology to more translational calibration settings."
"9399686","Transplant-associated arteriopathy (TAA) constitutes the major cause of graft failure and death in recipients who survive more than one year after cardiac transplantation, despite advances in immunosuppression. One of the early events leading to TAA is infiltration and activation of peri-adventitial inflammatory cells, including T cells and macrophages, which is followed by the formation of a diffuse, concentric neointima in which smooth muscle cells and leukocytes accumulate. Both T cell effectors and T regulatory cells play key roles in regulating the balance of allograft inflammation. Interestingly, age-related diminution of T cell responsiveness to mitogen signals have been linked to improved allograft survival. Indeed, epidemiological studies indicate that older recipients have reduced allograft rejection rates than younger recipients. As such, identification of factors that reduce activation of T cells could potentially impact both acute and chronic cardiac allograft rejection. Kruppel-like factors are transcriptional regulators of cell growth, differentiation, and activation. We identified a member of this family, KLF10, whose expression is highly expressed in T cells and increases with age. We identified that the TGF-b1-responsive factor, KLF10, regulates key aspects of both T cell effector and T regulatory cell function. Our preliminary studies uncover a novel role for KLF10 in age-related diminution of T cell activation in TAA. Major histocompatibility complex class II (MHC II)-mismatched cardiac allografts showed similar TAA and survival when transplanted into young recipients of either wild-type (WT) or KLF10-/- mice. In contrast, allografts in older KLF10-/- recipients developed accelerated TAA with increased accumulation of peri- adventitial T cells and macrophages, increased levels of pro-inflammatory markers (e.g. IFN-?, TNF-a, IL-6, and MCP-1), and reduced survival. Older KLF10-/- CD4+ T cells exhibited enhanced Th1 and decreased T regulatory cell (Treg) function with reduced expression of CTLA-4, an immunosuppressive molecule implicated in T cell responsiveness with aging. Finally, cardiac allografts transplanted into younger KLF10-/- hosts receiving older KLF10-/- T cells (vs. younger KLF10-/- T cells) showed increased TAA. Mechanistic studies demonstrate that KLF10 is targeted by a microRNA, miR-340, that is inversely expressed with KLF10 with increasing age to regulate TGF-b1/CTLA-4 signaling. These observations provide the foundation for our central hypothesis that KLF10 serves as a critical regulator of T cell responsiveness with aging and TAA. In Aim1, we will explore the upstream mechanisms regulating KLF10 expression in old and young T cell effectors. In Aim2, we will determine the molecular basis for impaired Th1 and Treg cell function in older CD4-KLF10-deficient mice critical for TAA. In Aim3, we will explore the effect of altered KLF10 expression on T cell responsiveness and experimental TAA using young and old, T cell-specific KLF10-KO mice and anti-miR-340 therapeutics. The results of these studies will provide considerable insights regarding KLF10 function in T cell biology, aging, and may serve as the basis for novel therapeutic strategies to modulate T cell responsiveness and TAA."
"9431929","Project Summary Defining how memory T helper type 2 (Th2) cells initiate a recall response to an aeroallergen has the potential to change our therapeutic approach to allergic asthma, the most common asthma subtype. During periods of disease quiescence, approximately 5-10% of effector Th2 cells driving allergic asthma give rise to long-lived memory cells that are poised to respond upon allergen re-exposure. Consequently, targeting memory Th2 cell activation is an attractive therapeutic strategy. However, it is not well understood how allergen inhalation initiates a memory Th2 cell response. Recently, a new paradigm in memory T cell biology has emerged in which tissue-resident memory T cells (Trm) persisting in non-lymphoid tissue rapidly initiate recall responses. While tissue-resident memory Th2 cells (Th2-Trm) have been described, the function of this population in promoting allergic inflammation is unclear. The objective of this proposal is to define the mechanisms whereby Th2-Trm persisting in the lung orchestrate a recall response to an inhaled allergen. Our central hypothesis is that Th2-Trm ignite allergic airway inflammation via a rapid and enhanced response to cognate antigen and the ability to recruit circulating Th2 cells to the sites of antigen presentation. Mechanistically, we hypothesize that Th2-Trm co-localize with dendritic cells (DCs) expressing the Th2 cell-attracting chemokine CCL17 and after allergen re-challenge rapidly produce type 2 cytokines that initiate allergic inflammation and markedly induce DC expression of CCL17. This enhanced CCL17 expression recruits circulating Th2 cells from the blood to sites of antigen presentation where they are activated, amplifying allergic inflammation. We propose to use innovative experimental systems to define the function of Th2-Trm, including parabiosis of allergen-treated and nave mice, a novel CCL17/CCL22 reporter mouse as well as single cell RNA-seq analysis of airway mucosal T cells from humans with allergic asthma. Specifically, we propose (1) To define the function of Th2-Trm in regulating recurrent allergic airway inflammation and (2) To define the role of CCL17 in regulating Th2-Trm localization and function. Dr. Rahimi will perform the work in this K08 proposal in the Center for Immunology and Inflammatory diseases (CIID) at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) under the mentorship of Dr. Andrew Luster. The CIID is a state-of-the-art multidisciplinary research center focused on mechanisms of immune-mediated inflammatory diseases and is the foundation for immunology research at MGH. Dr. Rahimi has developed a career development plan consisting of coursework in advanced microscopy, bioinformatics and human translational research as well as organized a Training Advisory Committee to provide expertise and assistance in these areas.

"9386772","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Dysregulation of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) turnover or function may contribute to the excess atherosclerosis in individuals with insulin-resistant (type 2) diabetes and metabolic syndrome. These conditions are characterized by low HDL. However, it is unknown how insulin regulates HDL in normal physiology, or in the pathophysiology of diabetes. FoxO1 is an insulin-repressible transcription factor that has emerged as a key mediator of insulin signaling in liver and the vessel wall. We have determined that FoxO1 regulates multiple genes critical for HDL metabolism and function, and mice lacking hepatic FoxO1 have alterations in HDL lipid and protein content. Thus, we propose that FoxO1 links insulin signaling and HDL. In Aim 1, we will investigate the hypothesis that FoxO1 regulates selective uptake of HDL-cholesterol in liver. We present preliminary data that FoxO1 regulates multiple steps in this process. In Aim 2, we will investigate the hypothesis that hepatic FoxO1 regulates macrophage-to-feces reverse cholesterol transport. We will determine the roles of individual HDL genes in the FoxO1 phenotype, and determine the effects on atherosclerosis. In Aim 3, we will investigate the hypothesis that FoxO1 regulates vasoprotective functions of HDL. We will examine the roles of FoxO1-regulated HDL components in endothelial barrier function and endothelial nitric oxide synthase activity. This work will build on novel hypotheses and a key mouse model to bring insight into the dysregulation of HDL during insulin resistance. The proposed studies will shed light on a key unanswered question in the pathophysiology of atherosclerosis, and reveal new targets for therapeutic intervention."
"9397547","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The retinal degenerative (RD) diseases are a heterogeneous group of conditions that range from the Mendellian inherited orphan diseases such as retinitis pigmentosa (RP) to the genetically complex disease age-related macular degeneration (AMD). With the exception of the neovascular (wet) form of AMD, these diseases remain essentially untreatable. As one approach to both increase our understanding of these diseases and develop novel treatment strategies, we propose to perform phenotypic screens for small molecules that could serve as molecular probes and/or lead molecules for drug development. In our first aim we propose to conduct high content screens (HCS) for photoreceptor (PR) differentiation-promoting and PR neuroprotective compounds using mouse primary retinal cultures, which have significant advantages over the use of established cell lines. As proof of principle for this approach, we have successfully used this strategy in the past to identify compounds that are neuroprotective for retinal ganglion cells both in vitro and in vivo. I aim 2, we propose a variety of secondary assays to characterize, classify and prioritize the active molecules identified in our primary screens. Another PR biological pathway that is sensitive to perturbation is the clearance of PR outer segments (OS). More than a dozen different mutations in the gene for MER tyrosine kinase (MERTK), which encodes the retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cell receptor necessary for PR OS phagocytosis, have been shown to cause RP. In aim 3, using an assay based upon human stem cell derived MERTK -mutant RPE cells, we will screen for compounds that can increase MERTK-independent RPE phagocytosis."
"9431712","PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Rare monogenic forms of common diseases have provided key fundamental insights about common disease. However, genetic, environmental, and stochastic elements influence risk for disease. Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH), an autosomal dominant disorder afflicting 1 in 250 linked to severe increases in LDL cholesterol and premature coronary heart disease (CHD) risk, is an ideal model to characterize modifiers of disease. Despite the presence of a strong genetic driver of hypercholesterolemia from FH mutations, we recently observed that half do not have the expected severe hypercholesterolemia. In this proposal, we outline several methods to discover and dissect the genetic and non-genetic factors influencing CHD risk conferred by FH mutations in humans and determine whether knowledge of these factors can improve risk discrimination among those with FH mutations. Our approach harnesses several multi-dimensional datasets: whole genome sequences, metabolomics, and cross-sectional and longitudinal cardiovascular phenotypes. In Aim 1, we will aggregate and curate 75,000 deep (30X) whole genome sequences and cardiovascular phenotypes. In Aim 2, we will discover genetic and non-genetic modifiers of LDL cholesterol and CHD risk in FH and evaluate their metabolomic consequences. In Aim 3, we will develop a method incorporating genetics and longitudinal non- genetic exposures for CHD risk stratification among ~4,000 with FH mutations in the Million Veteran Program. In addition to the proposed Aims, this five-year proposal outlines a comprehensive strategy for the principal investigator's (PI's) scientific and professional development in academic cardiovascular medicine. The research strategy builds upon the PI's prior research experience and clinical training. In addition to an undergraduate degree in Molecular Biology and master's degree in Biomedical Informatics, he completed post- graduate medical training in Internal Medicine and Cardiovascular Medicine. He recently developed a new preventive/genetic cardiology clinic focusing on the evaluation and management of those with or a family history of premature CHD, including those with FH, at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH). This proposal now focuses on expanding his scientific skills in human genetics and genomics into new domains: integrative genomics, statistical genetics, clinical informatics, and risk modeling.

This work will take place in a unique training environment comprised of MGH and the Broad Institute. Successful completion of this career development award will result in improved fundamental understanding of the determinants of CHD, result in the PI's transition to an independent physician-scientist, and provide a solid foundation from which he will apply for R01-level funding."
"9390492","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Peer Empowerment Program for Physical Activity in Low Income & Minority Seniors Older adults are the least active population group in the US. Yet, research has shown that an increase in physical activity (PA) can have immediate and profound effects on cardiovascular health. Older adults who are active use significantly fewer health care resources, and with the increasing number of older adults in the US it is imperative to curb health care expenditure in this group. Many PA interventions are flawed because they focus on individual motivations and ignore variations in community resources, neighborhood walkability, and safety. Low income and ethnically diverse communities have disproportionately fewer resources and less supportive neighborhoods. This contributes to lower PA levels and health disparities in obesity, diabetes, hypertension and heart disease. National and international health institutions have called for community based PA programs to improve population health. Senior centers are an ideal setting for PA interventions because they serve a large number of older adults and there are funding mechanisms for delivery of evidence based programs. While there are multiple benefits of different PA programs, national guidelines for PA still emphasize aerobic activity. Senior Centers currently offer group based PA programs but our preliminary studies show that 1) low income, ethnically diverse older adults attending such centers are not meeting PA guidelines, 2) evidence based programs in such centers do not generate moderate intensity PA, 3) they do not provide behavioral strategies to support more frequent and independent PA and 4) members are not involved in the delivery of such programs which may increase engagement and sustainability. We propose to build upon our NHLBI R01 funded PA program that increased aerobic activity in retirement community residents. The program was delivered by UCSD health educators for 6 months with the help of peer leaders who then sustained it over 12 months. To improve upon this work, we propose a train the trainer model with a greater focus on empowering the peer leaders, center staff and participants to self-monitor, self-organize and advocate for additional resources from the start. Since our aim is to test a PA program that can be adopted by local area aging agencies with Older Americans Act Title IIID funds, we will employ an effectiveness-implementation hybrid design; which allows for the concurrent testing of both intervention and implementation strategies and outcomes. We will also extend program monitoring to 24 months. Thus, in a 2-year cluster randomized controlled field trial of 408 ethnically diverse, older adults (50+ years old) in 12 low income Senior Centers in San Diego County we will investigate the efficacy of PEP4PA (Peer Empowerment Program 4 Physical Activity) to reduce disparities in PA by increasing the percentage of participants achieving 150 minutes of PA per week and to improve physical functioning & fitness, blood pressure, depressive symptoms and quality of life at 6, 12 & 24 months. We will assess the incremental cost effectiveness ratio of PEP4PA in terms of cost per MET hour and cost per QALY compared to usual programming in the control centers at 12 & 24 months."
"9387461","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Obesity has emerged as one of the most critical health care problems in the US as 69% of the US population is currently overweight or obese. Adipose tissue dysfunction is an essential hallmark linking obesity to the pathogenesis of cardiometabolic disease, and prior work form our group has demonstrated that qualitative properties of adipose tissue shape systemic phenotypes. In particular, impaired adipose tissue angiogenesis in obesity has been associated with inflammation and metabolic dysfunction; however pathogenic mechanisms are incompletely understood. We describe a novel endogenous isoform of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF-A), VEGF-A165b that is selectively over-expressed in obesity and inhibits angiogenesis. Our preliminary data suggest that perturbations in the Wnt5a signaling system up-regulates VEGF-A165b under conditions of obesity that is modified by bariatric surgical weight loss. In aim 1, we will examine adipose depot-specific microvascular angiogenic responses in biopsied fat samples from 150 obese and 50 lean subjects. We will characterize VEGF-A isoforms in relation to angiogenic capacity and vascularization. We hypothesize that inhibitory isoform VEGF-A165b will be up- regulated in obesity, associated with anti-angiogenic actions in fat, and relate to whole body metabolic dysfunction. In aim 2, specific inhibitors of Wnt signaling will be employed using human adipose tissue samples secured from aim 1 to provide a molecular framework for understanding the regulation of VEGF-A 165b expression. In aim 3, we will re-examine adipose angiogenic capacity and VEGF isoform expression at 6 months following bariatric surgery in the same 150 obese subjects from aim 1. We will test whether relevant molecular pathways specifically identified in aim 2 are influenced by weight reduction. We seek to identify novel determinants of adipose tissue biology and angiogenesis in relation to metabolic changes which will develop in association with marked weight loss in obese individuals. Our proposal may identify the Wnt5a-VEGF-A 165b axis as a novel modulator of angiogenesis, adipose tissue biology, and consequently, systemic disease in clinical obesity and potentially lead to the identification of new therapeutic targets."

The Core, which is  Cancer Center managed, was established in 1993 to produce transgenic and knockout mice for USC Norris  members and to increase the use of mouse technology through education and consultation to the cancer  research community. Since its inception, the Core has operated under the same faculty leader, Dr. Robert  Maxson, and manager, Dr. Nancy Wu; it has also been continuously funded by the CCSG. The Core is widely  recognized within the USC community and beyond for the high quality of its services. The Core produces  transgenic and knockout mice and offers two important new services, knockout rats and CRISPR/Cas9-  mediated gene editing in mice. Using ES cell technology pioneered by Dr. Qi-Long Ying at USC, the Core  generated the first knockout rats. The new CRISPR/Cas9 technology will make it possible to produce gene  knockouts much faster and at lower cost than current ES cell-based technology. The Core continues to be  active in education and consulting services, and provides a number of important ancillary services, including in  vitro fertilization, and re-derivation of mouse strains, as well as cryopreservation of embryos. At the last CCSG  renewal, the Core received a merit rating of ?excellent? with reviewers noting the competence of the Core  leadership and the high quality of the work. The only criticism was low usage by Cancer Center members,  although it was recognized that the Core serves the entire USC community. We have stepped up efforts to  promote the availability of the Core and encourage cancer investigators to use Core services in their research.  In the most recent year, 12 peer-review funded members, or 71% of total users, from four Research Programs  (Epigenetics and Regulation, Gastrointestinal Cancers, Molecular Genetics, and Tumor Microenvironment)  used the Core to accomplish their research objectives."
"9389004","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Abstract Stroke is the leading cause of adult disability and a leading cause of death in the US, and results in $21 billion in direct medical costs each year. Stroke disproportionately impacts minorities including Hispanics who have higher stroke risk, poorer outcomes after stroke, and a higher prevalence of post-stroke sleep-disordered breathing (SDB). Declining stroke mortality in combination with the aging US population will result in dramatic increases in the number of disabled stroke survivors, with the largest increases projected among Hispanics. New approaches to improve stroke outcomes are therefore urgently needed, and may be particularly important among Hispanics, the largest US minority population. One critical yet scarcely explored opportunity may exist through identification and treatment of SDB in individuals with stroke. SDB is highly prevalent after stroke, and its presence predicts poor functional outcome and higher mortality. Nonetheless, very few stroke patients are screened or treated for SDB. Little information is available about which patients are likely to have high risk SDB after stroke; the trajectory of SDB in this setting and how to predict it; and almost no data are available for Hispanics. This information may offer opportunities to improve critical post-stroke outcomes and lessen ethnic stroke disparities. Thus, the main goals of the research proposed are 1) develop risk stratification models for post-stroke patients with SDB, 2) provide novel insight into the trajectory that SDB takes after stroke to inform management decisions, 3) inform the design of a subsequent clinical trial that will assess the impact of treatment of high risk SDB on key post-stroke outcomes, and 4) explore a possible treatable cause for worse stroke outcomes in Hispanics. We plan to take advantage of an exceptional opportunity provided by the ongoing Brain Attack Surveillance in Corpus Christi (BASIC) project (R01 NS38916). In this population-based stroke surveillance study in a bi-ethnic community, all acute ischemic stroke patients are interviewed at baseline and followed prospectively for 3, 6 and 12 month outcomes. The current application will add longitudinal SDB assessments to BASIC using a validated portable SDB screening device. SDB severity will be assessed with the apnea/hypopnea index, as well as innovative measures derived from signal analysis. Use of BASIC provides a cost-effective opportunity to expand our knowledge about SDB after stroke in ways that can directly impact clinical care, future clinical trial design, and health disparities."
"9395931","PROJECT SUMMARY  Improve PAD PERformance with METformin: The PERMET Trial.  Our work and that of others has established that people with lower extremity peripheral artery disease (PAD) have greater functional impairment, faster functional decline, and increased rates of mobility loss compared to people without PAD. However, few therapies are available that improve functioning or prevent functional decline in people with PAD.  Metformin is an inexpensive, widely available, well tolerated biguanide medication and the most commonly prescribed drug for Type 2 diabetes mellitus worldwide. Recent pre-clinical and preliminary human evidence suggest that metformin has previously unrecognized therapeutic properties. Therapeutic properties of metformin in pre-clinical models that may benefit people with PAD include: calf skeletal muscle increases in peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha (PGC-1?) (a major regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis), calf skeletal muscle increases in mitochondrial protein expression and activity, increases in capillary density in ischemic tissue, reductions in oxidative stress, increased autophagy (repair of cellular damage), and improved endothelial function. These therapeutic properties target pathophysiologic conditions present in PAD. Therefore, we hypothesize that metformin will improve lower extremity functioning in people with PAD, by facilitating favorable changes in calf skeletal muscle and by increasing calf skeletal muscle perfusion. No randomized clinical trials have studied whether metformin improves lower extremity functioning in PAD. A definitive trial is needed.  We propose a placebo controlled double-blind randomized clinical trial to establish whether metformin (2,000 mgs daily) improves and/or prevents decline in walking performance in people with PAD. Participants will be 212 people with PAD who do not have diabetes mellitus, since metformin is a first-line therapy for Type 2 diabetes. Our primary outcome is change in six-minute walk at 6-month follow-up. Secondary outcomes are 6-month changes in treadmill walking performance, brachial artery flow-mediated dilation, calf skeletal muscle biopsy measures, patient-reported walking performance, and quality of life. Calf muscle outcomes consist of changes in PGC-1? abundance, mitochondrial quantity, mitochondrial enzyme activity, capillary density, reactive oxygen species (ROS)-induced tissue damage, and autophagy.  If metformin improves functional performance and prevents functional decline in PAD, this widely available, inexpensive, and well tolerated medication will have a major impact on preventing mobility loss and improving quality of life in the large and growing number of people with PAD."
"9554364","Project Summary  Awkward body positions lead to an arm or leg ?falling asleep.? Upon repositioning, blood rushes back into the limb, with nerves spontaneously regaining function after being deprived of oxygen and electrolytes. While asleep, cellular and molecular processes within the ischemic limb may produce bioactive restorative and regenerative compounds that are released intravenously upon reperfusion. The method of intentional, intermittent restriction of blood flow to a limb is called Remote Ischemic Conditioning (RIC), which can be achieved by simple and cost- effective application of a tourniquet to a limb for several cycles of pre-determined duration. RIC can protect the brain and other organs from ischemic, surgical, and traumatic events, whether administered prior to or following the event. In fact, our team has demonstrated that RIC reduced biomarkers of acute damage in traumatic brain injury (TBI) patients. In pre-clinical cardiac arrest and cerebral ischemia, RIC preserves histopathology and improves functional outcome, using either pre-injury or post-injury RIC. To date, the mechanisms underlying RIC efficacy are unknown, with a dozen conflicting mechanisms proposed. TBI and other acquired neurological injuries share secondary injury processes, including inflammation and oxidative stress, which have been repeated targets of neuroprotective strategies. We propose a class of endogenous lipids derived from fatty acids, called Specialized Pro-Resolving Mediators (SPMs), as the molecular mechanism for RIC efficacy. SPMs, including the molecular families of resolvins, lipoxins, and protectins, are released from lipid bilayers after ischemia, actively resolve inflammation, and are neuroprotective in diffuse TBI, with the assumed biostability to travel in blood to the brain and the lipid structure for blood-brain barrier permeability. In this proposal, we hypothesize that RIC preserves neurological function following experimental diffuse TBI by producing SPMs, which mitigate injury-induced inflammation. To test the hypothesis, we apply RIC sequences to the hind limb of adult mice, first before and then after diffuse TBI induced by midline fluid percussion injury. Aim 1 will evaluate the efficacy of RIC sequences on preserving neurological, cognitive, and affective function over a 21 day time course post-injury. Aim 2, using the most effective sequence of RIC identified in Aim 1, will demonstrate that RIC attenuates microglial activation as an index of inflammation and produces SPMs as measured in plasma by liquid chromatography-coupled tandem mass spectrometry and commercial ELISA. Results from these aims will identify the RIC sequence necessary to improve neurological outcome from diffuse TBI. Further, we explore the production of SPMs as the molecular mechanism that targets microglial activation. Direct evidence is necessary to support the efficacy of RIC as a therapeutic approach to treat the estimated 1.7 million TBIs that occur in the United States. Ultimately, RIC could serve as a cost-effective and feasible therapy for delivering endogenous restorative and reparative compounds, such as SPMs, to improve outcome from TBI."
"9397558","Abstract  Our laboratory was the first to demonstrate unequivocally that several isoforms of small conductance Ca2+- activated K+ channels (SK or KCa2 channels) underlie Ca2+-activated K+ current (IK,Ca) in cardiomyocytes. Indeed, interests in cardiac SK channels are fueled by recent studies suggesting the possible roles of SK channels in human atrial fibrillation (AF) and up-regulation of SK channels in heart failure (HF). Therefore, SK channel may represent a novel therapeutic target for cardiac arrhythmias.  Even though the activation and trafficking of SK channels are Ca2+-dependent, the Ca2+ source remains undefined. In addition, the Ca2+-dependence of SK channels is inextrictably linked to calmodulin (CaM), whose mutations have been shown to be associated with human arrhythmias. Since CaM is ubiquitous, it is paramount to disentangle the web of CaM-regulated ion channels from the roles of SK channels in calmodulinopathy. Moreover, SK channel expression is upregulated in HF but the exact mechanisms remain incompletely understood. Blockade of SK channels has been shown to be both anti-arrhythmic and proarrhythmic in various models. These aforementioned challenges are the premises of the present proposal. Thus, the essence of this proposal is to deploy innovative imaging, functional analyses, and molecular modeling to address successively the regulation of cardiac Ca2+-activated K+ channels in normal and failing cardiac myocytes."
"9392483","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed studies will address fundamental questions regarding the mechanisms underlying inflammation-induced enhancement of both hyperactive (contractile) and proliferative (synthetic) states of human airway smooth muscle (hASM), which are hallmarks of asthma. Identifying these mechanisms is the key to developing novel therapeutic targets for asthma. Our central hypothesis is that in hASM, inflammatory cytokines induce sarco-endoplasmic reticulum (SR/ER) stress leading to reduced expression of the mitochondrial fusion protein mitofusin 2 (Mfn2), and that this pathway plays a central role in asthma by triggering both hyper reactive (contractile) and proliferative (synthetic) states. Four Specific Aims are proposed: Specific Aim 1: To determine the impact of inflammatory cytokines on SR/ER stress, Mfn2 expression and mitochondrial fragmentation. In this aim, we will use dissociated hASM cells and tissue from normal and asthmatic patients to test the hypothesis that inflammatory cytokines trigger SR/ER stress due at least in part to an increase in ROS generation, and that SR/ER stress leads to reduced Mfn2 expression and increased mitochondrial fragmentation. Specific Aim 2: To determine the functional impact of SR/ER stress and reduced Mfn2 expression. In this aim, we will use dissociated hASM cells and tissue from normal and asthmatic patients to test the hypothesis that in hASM, inflammatory cytokine-induced SR/ER stress and reduced Mfn2 expression uncouples mitochondria and the SR/ER, thereby reducing mitochondrial Ca2+ buffering leading to elevated [Ca2+]cyt and force responses to agonist stimulation. Specific Aim 3: To determine the impact of SR/ER stress and reduced Mfn2 on hASM cell proliferation. In this aim, we will use dissociated hASM cells and tissue from normal and asthmatic patients to test the hypothesis that inflammatory cytokines increase hASM cell proliferation as a result of decreased Mfn2 expression. Specific Aim 4: To determine the efficacy of therapeutic approaches targeting SR/ER stress in alleviating airway hyper reactivity and remodeling in a mouse model of asthma. In this aim, we will use a mixed allergen mouse model to test the hypothesis that targeting SR/ER stress using chemical chaperones (e.g., 4-PBA, TUDCA) will provide an effective therapeutic strategy to reverse airway hyperactivity and blunt remodeling associated with asthma."
"9385707","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading killer of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) who have a 2-3 fold increased risk of myocardial infarction compared to members of the general population. Traditional cardiovascular (CV) risk factors alone do not accurately predict CVD in RA patients and therefore adequate primary prevention strategies are lacking. Systemic inflammation from active RA is strongly associated with CV risk in RA patients, but mechanisms by which inflammation increases CV morbidity and mortality are poorly understood. High density lipoprotein (HDL) is an anti-atherogenic molecule that regulates systemic inflammation by promoting cholesterol efflux and preventing oxidation of low density lipoproteins (LDL). We have previously demonstrated that HDL function is impaired and significantly associated with both disease activity and systemic inflammation, in patients with RA. We further showed that active RA leads to oxidative and protein changes in HDL resulting in dysfunctional HDL. Oxidized low density lipoproteins (ox-LDL) have been directly implicated in the pathogenesis of RA through signaling via the lectin-like ox-LDL receptor 1 (LOX- 1) in the joint synovium. Our preliminary results suggest that modulation of HDL function by increasing HDL's ability to prevent oxidation of LDL is associated with improvement in arthritis activity. We hypothesize that modulation of HDL function represents a novel pathway through which to both decrease arthritis activity and improve CV risk in patients with RA. We will test our hypothesis under two specific aims. In aim 1, we will evaluate whether modulation of HDL function using HDL mimetic peptides can reduce atherosclerosis and joint inflammation in a recently established mouse model of RA. We will also modulate HDL function by paraoxonase 1 (PON1) gene deletion and overexpression to evaluate the effects on arthritis activity and atherosclerosis in this model. In aim 2, we will determine whether abnormal HDL function contributes to increased CV risk in a carefully characterized, prospective cohort of over 200 RA patients using in vitro assays of HDL function and targeted HDL proteomics and lipidomics. CV risk will be assessed by the progression of carotid atherosclerosis over three year follow-up and by carotid plaque inflammation using positron emission tomography with fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG-PET). The results of this work may identify important mechanisms through which inflammation increases CV risk in RA patients, and thereby determine new markers for risk assessment and specific targets for intervention."

The training program builds upon the candidate's background in methodological research in biostatistics and risk prediction modelling and is focused on learning lipidomics and advanced statistical techniques that are used in targeted, untargeted and network pathway analyses of metabolomics data. This application is supported by a team of established mentors and by a strong institutional commitment of a leading research hospital which is part of a network of Boston-area universities and institutions with abundant opportunities to learn about cutting edge medical research, and to build cross- disciplinary collaborations. The research goal of this proposal is to define lipid profiles that best predict the risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) and to characterize their metabolomic signatures. Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) particles are a causal biomarker in the development of atherosclerosis and CHD. Yet recent studies reported that there is residual lipid-related risk information beyond standard lipid biomarkers. Dr. Demler will extend the standard lipid panel and use additional lipid parameters such as non-high density lipoprotein cholesterol, apolipoprotein B (apoB), and LDL particle concentration, among others. Of special interest are the individuals with discordant combinations of LDL-C and apoB (e.g. low LDL-C, but higher than expected apoB), a group that has substantially higher CHD risk than those with concordant combination of the two parameters even after controlling for LDL-C level and standard risk factors. First, in the Women's Health Study, Dr. Demler will find the most informative combinations of lipid parameters and discordant lipids that best predict CHD events. She will validate these findings in a more demographically diverse VITAL cohort. Second, Dr. Demler will characterize the metabolomic profiles of lipids and lipid combinations including discordant lipids associated with CHD in the VITAL metabolomic sub-study, using state-of-the-art statistical techniques in untargeted, and network metabolomic analyses. This project leverages the candidate's strong background in risk prediction and combines an outstanding research and training environment with already collected CHD outcomes, lipid measurements, and large-scale metabolomics data, providing a unique opportunity to the candidate to gain skills and experience necessary for her career as an independent researcher in statistical analysis of metabolomics/lipidomics data in cardiovascular diseases. The knowledge gained from this project will increase our understanding of specific metabolic mechanisms that govern the association between wide array of lipid measures and CHD by identifying their underlying metabolic dysregulation. Thus, it will address important public health issues and could provide insight into disease pathogenesis and potential development of therapeutic targets."
"9398146","Project Summary Calcific aortic valve disease (CAVD) affects a large number of people over age 65. Currently, aortic valve replacement surgery is the only available therapy for this disease. Pharmacological intervention of CAVD progression relies on better understanding of the underlying mechanism. Progressive valvular calcification is the main cause of CAVD progression. Elevated levels of bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2) and transforming growth factor-?1 (TGF-?1) in valvular tissue contribute to the mechanism of progressive aortic valve calcification, and the aortic valve interstitial cells (AVICs) play a critical role in valvular calcification via pro-osteogenic reprogramming. While BMP-2 and TGF-?1 induce AVIC pro- osteogenic reprogramming and myofibroblastic transition, the molecular mechanism underlying the actions of BMP-2 and TGF- ?1 on AVIC is not well understood, and the role of AVIC myofibroblastic transition in valvular calcification is unknown. We found that both BMP-2 and TGF-?1 up-regulate miR- 486 expression and down-regulate miR-204 expression in human AVICs. Further, co-expression of miR- 486 antagomir and 204 mimic suppresses the pro-osteogenic activity in AVICs of diseased human aortic valves, and miR-486 mimic and miR-204 antagomir elevate the levels of osteogenic transcription factors Runx2 and Osx. Further, miR-204 mimic and miR-486 antagomir synergizes in up-regulation of AVIC pro- osteogenic activity. Based on these novel findings, we hypothesize that miR-486 up-regulation and miR- 204 down-regulation promote aortic valve calcification. The major goals of this project are to elucidate the molecular mechanism of aortic valve calcification and to identify potential therapeutic targets for prevention of CAVD progression. To achieve these goals, we will address the following interrelated Specific Aims: 1) to determine the interaction of miR-486 and miR-204 in elevating the pro-osteogenic activity in human aortic valves and AVICs, 2) to test the hypothesis that miR-486 up-regulates human AVIC pro-osteogenic activity through promoting myofibroblastic transition, and 3) to elucidate the mechanism by which TGF-?1 and BMP-2 modulate miR-486 and miR-204 expression in human AVICs. The results of this project will help improve the understanding of the mechanism responsible for CAVD progression and may identify potential targets for pharmacological intervention."
"9403214","Two-stage miRNA delivering scaffolds for patient-originated cells to regenerate blood vessels There are about 1.4 million arterial bypass operations annually in the US, but many patients who require arterial bypass procedures do not have suitable vessels for use. Although synthetic materials are frequently used to treat vascular disease, their failure rate, especially in replacing small-diameter vessels, remains high. Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) have enormous potential for the repair of diseased or traumatized blood vessels. Indeed, we, among the first, have successfully induced iPSC differentiation to smooth muscle cells (SMCs) in culture and on biomimetic 3D scaffolds. However, it takes more than 2 months to generate patient- specific iPSCs and iPSC-derived SMCs and there is potential for oncogenesis. Provocatively, we have established a direct differentiation protocol for SMCs from patient fibroblasts using three determined factors. Also, we found that microRNA-10a (miR-10a) plays an important role in SMC differentiation and helps SMCs maintain the differentiated contractile phenotype. For SMC direct differentiation and future clinical application, an efficient non-viral vector is highly desired. Fortunately, we recently developed a novel hyperbranched polymer vector and a two-stage delivery system to highly efficiently deliver microRNAs and plasmids into cells in a temporally controlled manner. Our long-term goal is to regenerate functional human blood vessels using patient-originated fibroblasts. The key to functional blood vessel regeneration using fibroblasts is the in situ direct differentiation and maintenance of the contractile phenotype of the vascular SMCs. In this proposal, we hypothesize that sustained and highly efficient miRNA/plasmid delivery into fibroblasts and SMCs on a 3D nanofibrous scaffold will regenerate a contractile SMC-laden functional vascular graft. The specific aims of this project are: 1) Determine the mechanistic roles of miR-10a, HDAC4 and associated signaling pathways in fibroblast/SMC transdifferentiation; 2) Develop anatomically-designed nanofibrous scaffolds using a reverse 3D printing technology and immobilize sustained two-stage miRNA/plasmid delivery system on the scaffolds; 3) Evaluate engineered vascular scaffold in vitro and in vivo. By accomplishing these specific aims, we will improve mechanistic understandings of fibroblast/SMC transdifferentiation how to maintain the SMC contractile phenotype in the vascular scaffold and develop key miRNA/DNA delivery and 3D tissue engineering technologies to advance the therapeutic utility of patient-originated cells for human vascular regeneration."
"9391010","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Breathing is generated by a neuronal network that is distributed along the rostro-caudal axis of the ventrolateral medulla (ventral respiratory column, VRC). This network gives rise to three distinct phases: inspiration (I), post-inspiration (Post-I), and active expiration (AE). Many disorders are associated with disturbances in different forms of breathing and the response to hypoxia. Thus understanding how these phases of breathing are generated and dynamically regulated under various conditions such as hypoxia is of great basic scientific and clinical interest. In this project we introduce two novel rhythmicall active brainstem slice preparations that allow us to study the integration of synaptic, intrinsic and modulatory properties in the wider medullary network to an extent that was not possible before. Based on our preliminary data we propose the hypothesis that post-I and inspiration are generated by an excitatory column that extends rostrally from the pre-Btzinger complex into the Btzinger complex. This distributed excitatory network interacts with GABAergic and glycinergic mechanisms as well as intrinsic membrane properties that will be explored in the horizontal slice preparation using a variety of electrophysiological, pharmacological, and optogenetic approaches (Aim 1). Insights gained in this horizontal slice preparation will be compared with data obtained from two transverse slice preparations that isolate the caudal and rostral portion of this excitatory column (Aim 2). This approach will allow us to differentiate rhythmogenic mechanisms occurring at the caudal and rostral end of this column. Concepts revealed in these in vitro findings will then be tested in a spontaneously breathing in vivo preparation (Aim 3). We expect that the introduction of these novel in vitro preparations, combined with modern optogenetic techniques and a rigorous integration with in vivo approaches will allow us to revisit existing models of respiratory rhythm generation. This may lead to a better understanding of various issues that remain unresolved and unexplained at the current state of knowledge in the field of neural control of breathing."
"9387397","Project Summary/Abstract  The Molecular Genetics Program has been continuously approved through the NCI CCSG since the USC  Norris first received NCI designation over 35 years ago. This Program has always been distinguished  nationally for its strength in DNA replication and DNA repair, with an emphasis on applying discoveries toward  cancer chemotherapy. During the project period, Preet Chaudhary joined Michael Lieber as Co-Leader to add  depth in translation and oversee a new theme on the molecular genetics of cancers associated with infection  by HHV8, including the development of targeted therapies for the treatment of these cancers. The Program  has three integrated aims: 1) DNA replication, cell cycle, and cell proliferation in genetic instability; 2) DNA  repair and recombination in genetic instability; and 3) viral oncogenesis with an emphasis on HHV8. Lymphoid  malignancies are used as a disease model used by Program members for all three aims. Members continue to  be highly interactive within and across themes and across program boundaries. The 39 Program members,  who come from three schools and 13 departments, have $11.4M in peer-reviewed funding (direct costs), of  which 18% is from NCI, 61% from other NIH sources, and 8% from other peer-reviewed funding sources. The  Program is highly productive with 439 publications of which 21% are inter-programmatic, 15% intra-  programmatic and 25% inter-institutional. Program Leaders organize retreats and mini-symposia several times  per year to cross-fertilize research within and across Programs while remaining watchful to ensure a high level  of member crosstalk. This has led to high success in securing new P01s that are intra- and inter-programmatic,  while also cross-cutting thematically. Examples include renewal of an NCI P01 on understanding human DNA  polymerase active sites and development of new chemotherapeutics (Goodman, McKenna, Warshel), and a  new NCI P01 on viral oncogenesis by KSHV (HHV8) (Jung, Feng, Gao). Members have been particularly  successful in seeking new cancer drug therapies, which has been achieved with the Translational and Clinical  Sciences Program."
"9448746","Metastatic lung cancer kills >180,000 people in the United States annually and only ~10% of patients with lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) have targetable driver genomic alterations. There remains an unmet need for innovative therapies. BRMS1 is a metastasis suppressor gene that is decreased in LUAD and is associated with increased cancer migration, invasion, and poor prognosis. Mutations in DNA binding domain (DBD) of p53 are common in LUAD and are associated with increased metastases. We have made a novel observation that BRMS1 functions as transcription factor for selected metastasis-related genes in p53mut but not p53WT LUAD. Specifically, we show that BRMS1 binds promoter regions containing active p53 responsive elements to transcriptionally regulate metastasis-related genes, Maspin and Serpine1, in p53mut but not p53WT LUAD. Moreover, we demonstrate that BRMS1 expression is related to biologically distinct histologic subtypes of LUAD and that restoration of BRMS1 using the CK2 inhibitor CX4945 results in significantly less cell migration and invasion in p53mut compared with p53WT LUAD. Our overarching goal is to determine the importance of maintaining BRMS1 in the context of p53 mutations using clinically relevant, human LUAD samples, patient-derived organoids (PDO), and conditional GEMM models. Two Specific Aims will test our hypotheses: Aim 1) Identify downstream targets and associated components of BRMS1-mediated transcription in p53mut LUAD. We will use ChIP-seq to identify genome-wide specific BRMS1-DNA binding regions in p53mut LUAD cells. We will then determine the functional significance of BRMS1-DNA binding on transcriptional regulation by performing RNA-seq in BRMS1WT and BRMS1KO LUAD isogenic cells with different p53 status. Next, using shRNA screens combined with reporter gene assays to characterize gene-specific components, we test the hypothesis that BRMS1 differentially regulates transcription via interaction with unique transcription co-factors in p53mut LUAD. Aim 2) Determine the requirement for BRMS1 in regulating metastases in human p53mut LUAD. We will leverage our extensive, clinically-annotated biorepository of >2000 human LUAD specimens with varying p53 mutational profiles, pathologic stages, and histologic subtypes to characterize the spectrum of LUAD tumors. We then examine the efficacy of the CK2 inhibitor, CX4945, in preventing BRMS1 degradation and decreasing metastases in specific histological subtypes of LUAD using our newly developed LUAD patient-derived organoid (PDO) model of metastases. We use this PDO model modified with an inducible expression system to assess the importance of maspin, and serpine1 on BRMS1-mediated metastasis suppression. Finally, using our newly created Brms1-/-/KrasG12D GEMM with intratracheal delivery of p53mut CRISPR we create a metastatic LUAD mouse model to assess the requirement of BRMS1 for CX4945- mediated suppression of metastases. Impact: Our work will provide mechanistic and translational evidence to support future clinical trials that target BRMS1 in p53mut LUAD with biologically distinct histologic subtypes."
"9425747","PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT It is becoming increasingly evident that the majority of the mammalian genome has the potential to express non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs). However, the functionality and mechanism(s) of regulation of these ncRNAs are just beginning to be explored. One challenge that biologists encounter is the detection of these ncRNAs, which often tend to be transcriptionally tightly controlled and rapidly degraded. We have recently identified a long noncoding (lnc) RNA expressing locus, known as lncRNA-CSR, that regulates DNA rearrangments in the Immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) locus of B cells. Using mouse model systems that lack lncRNA processing/degradation activity along with a combination with high throughput genomics, bioinformatics, and various ChIP-seq based experiments, we are able to predict long-range transcription enhancer function of the lncRNA-CSR locus. In this application, we continue to focus our investigation on the functionality of lncRNA-CSR and three other novel lncRNA expressing loci, that we propose to have a role in orchestrating DNA rearrangment events in germinal center resident B cells. B lymphocytes have the unique ability to undergo programmed somatic mutagenesis of their genomes (at immunoglobulin gene loci) to generate the diversity of antibodies required by our immune system to combat the plethora of antigens we might encounter, a process known as antibody diversification. However, as collateral damage emerging from this very unusual and useful ability to undertake beneficial somatic mutagenesis events is the ability of B cells accidently to mutate their genome at a very low frequency at various inappropriate locations. These accidental mutations are the cause of various B cell malignancies, particularly those that evolve from germinal center derived B cells. Interestingly, cancer-causing translocations in B cells occur at regions of divergent transcription?that is, promoters and enhancers?which exist inside topological domains of superenhancer clusters. We postulate that lncRNA-CSR is responsible for tethering long distant regulatory elements (i.e, promoters and enhancers) in the IgH locus superenhancer cluster to facilitate genome organization, transcription control of regulated genes, and, ultimately, to promote antibody diversification mechanisms without inducing cancer causing DNA alterations."
"9411119","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Light has profound influences on many non-image forming (NIF) visual functions including circadian rhythms, sleep, mood, body temperature and the pupillary light reflex. In mammals, light influences these NIF functions through three retinal photoreceptors, namely the classical photoreceptors, rods and cones, and the intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs), which express the photopigment melanopsin. As ganglion cells, ipRGCs integrate rod/cone input with their own intrinsic melanopsin-based phototransduction to serve as the sole conduits to signal light information to brain regions important for these NIF functions. However, how ipRGCs, a seemingly homogeneous population, integrate extrinsic light input from rods and cones with their own intrinsic melanopsin-based light responses to coordinate diverse behaviors is poorly understood. The overall goal of this competitive renewal is to address this fundamental question at three levels. In Aim I, we will determine the functional circuits by which rod, cone and melanopsin-based signals are integrated in ipRGCs to drive NIF functions. Recently, we found that ipRGCs are much more diverse than previously appreciated, consisting of multiple morphologically and electrophysiologically distinct subtypes. Additionally, ipRGCs appear to be unique among retinal ganglion cells in that they co-express two neurotransmitters, glutamate and a neuropeptide, PACAP. Thus, in Aim II, we will define the relative contribution of glutamatergic and peptidergic neurotransmission to diverse NIF functions. In Aim III, we will elucidate the functional contribution of individual ipRGC subtypes to NIF functions. These studies will advance our current understanding of the role of ipRGCs in controlling light- mediated behaviors that are essential to human health and a better quality of life."

"9424693","Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a life-threatening disorder of the pulmonary circulation associated with loss and impaired regeneration of microvessels. Pericytes are highly specialized cells that interact with endothelial cells to promote vessel survival but little is known about their role in repair and regeneration of pulmonary microvessels. One possibility is that failure of pericytes to associate with endothelial cells could contribute to small vessel loss in PAH by reducing regeneration and viability of pulmonary microvessels. Using an in vitro co-culture model, we found that pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (PMVECs) purified from PAH lungs are unable to recruit healthy lung pericytes; likewise, PAH lung pericytes fail to associate with healthy PMVECs, suggesting an inherent defect in mechanisms responsible for endothelial-pericyte interactions. We have discovered that inability of PAH PMVECs to recruit pericytes is associated with reduced production and release of the Wnt/PCP ligand Wnt5a, since supplementation with recombinant Wnt5a improves pericyte recruitment and vessel formation. Interestingly, we found that PAH pericytes are resistant to Wnt5a stimulation, suggesting a possible defect in Wnt/PCP receptor function. Genetic screening led us to identify ROR2 as a candidate receptor required for Wnt/PCP activation in response to Wnt5a and its loss prevents pericyte recruitment to healthy microvessels. Therefore, we hypothesize that establishment of pulmonary endothelial-pericyte interaction is dependent on PMVEC production of Wnt5a, which attracts pericytes via ROR2 dependent activation of the Wnt/PCP pathway. Through a combination of novel transgenic animal models, molecular biology and gene editing, we will elucidate for the first time how Wnt5a and ROR2 orchestrate communication between PMVECs and pericytes (Aims 1 and 2). In addition, we will also pursue exciting preliminary data that links reduced Wnt5a production in PAH PMVECs to loss of bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling, a key signaling pathway whose dysregulation is linked to PAH (Aim 3). Finally, we will demonstrate that PMVEC exosomes are required to deliver Wnt5a to pericytes and apply a novel technology to isolate and engineer exosomes for in vivo Wnt5a delivery (Aim 4). Understanding how Wnt5a and ROR2 orchestrate endothelial-pericyte interactions can provide insight into the mechanism behind progressive small vessel loss in PAH and open new therapeutic opportunities to promote regeneration of lost vessels, prevent progression and improve clinical outcomes for patients afflicted with this devastating disease. ! Pericyte EC Proposed model. Pulmonary endothelial cells (ECs) produce and release Wnt5a in exosomes, which drives pericyte recruitment by triggering ROR2 phosphorylation (P) and Wnt/PCP activation (top). Loss of BMPR2 in PAH ECs results in reduced Wnt5a production and release with consequent reduced Wnt/PCP activation and failure to establish endothelial-pericyte interactions (bottom)."
"9404053","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Aside from age, elevated blood pressure is the most predominant cardiovascular disease risk factor worldwide. In the United States it is estimated that ~60% of the adult population have elevated blood pressure in either the prehypertensive (120-139/80-89 mmHg) or hypertensive (>140/90 mmHg) range. Both prehypertension (particularly systolic BP >130 mmHg) and hypertension are associated with increased risk for myocardial infarction, heart failure, stroke and vascular disease. Endothelial dysfunction is a major factor underlying the increased risk of vascular events with elevated blood pressure. In addition, insufficient nightly sleep (<7 hr/night) and poor sleep quality have been linked not only to the etiology of elevated blood pressure but are also a prevalent, often ignored, comorbidity. Indeed, short sleep duration and/or poor sleep quality is now considered to be a plausible risk factor for elevated blood pressure and a harbinger of increased cardiovascular risk. A high prevalence of insufficient nightly sleep has been reported in hypertensive adults. Importantly, habitual sleep duration of less than 7 hr/night is independently associated with an increased risk of stroke and coronary artery disease. The influence of insufficient sleep on vascular endothelial function in adults with elevated blood pressure is unknown. Moreover, given the emerging relation between sleep duration and quality and blood pressure, sleep represents an important, and currently neglected, therapeutic target for improving vascular health and, in turn, reducing cardiovascular risk in adults with elevated blood pressure. The present proposal will test the following hypotheses: 1) that chronic insufficient sleep is associated with diminished endothelium- dependent nitric oxide-mediated vasodilation and endothelial tissue-type plasminogen activator release in adults with elevated blood pressure. Furthermore, the postulated diminishment in endothelial vasodilator and fibrinolytic function with insufficient sleep will be due, at least in part, to increased oxidative stress; and 2) increasing sleep duration and improving sleep quality (utilizing individualized targeted sleep interventions) will increase both endothelium-dependent nitric oxide-mediated vasodilation and endothelial tissue-type plasminogen activator release in adults with elevated blood pressure. Increases in endothelial vasodilator and fibrinolytic function will be due, at least in part, to reduced oxidative stress. To test these hypotheses, 124 middle-aged adults with elevated blood pressure (>130/80 mmHg) will be studied. Endothelial vasodilator and fibrinolytic function will be assessed, in vivo, using an isolated forearm model. The proposed study will provide new and clinically important information regarding the influence of insufficient sleep on vascular endothelial function in adults with elevated blood pressure. Moreover, determining the possible cardioprotective effects of improving sleep and circadian physiology on vascular endothelial vasodilator and fibrinolytic function in adults with elevated blood pressure is clinically innovative, novel and critical to the development of optimal strategies (both primary and adjunctive) to mitigate blood pressure-related cardiovascular risk."
"9473209","ABSTRACT Pneumonia followed by sepsis remains a major cause of mortality, morbidity and health care burden in the U.S. and world. Pneumonia is also the important cause of acute respiratory failure leading to acute lung injury (ALI) or its severe form, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Despite decades of research into the pathophysiology of ALI/ARDS, no effective pharmacological treatments are available. Although neutrophil accumulation and proper function of neutrophils in the lungs and extrapulmonary organs are a critical defense to bacteria, excessive neutrophil influx can induce severe organ damage. Thus, a better understanding of the innate defense mechanisms, which regulate neutrophil influx and function, is critical to designing improved therapeutics for pneumonia. We have focused on Klebsiella pneumoniae, since this bacterium causes extensive lung damage followed by sepsis, involves neutrophils that are crucial to control K. pneumoniae infections, the spread of carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae (CRKP), and due to the lack of effective vaccine for K. pneumoniae. Stem cells have been shown to possess anti-inflammatory properties that can be used to treat infectious and inflammatory lung diseases similar to ALI/ARDS. One such therapy involves the administration of bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs), which represent a cell population originally isolated from the stromal compartment of bone marrow although these cells lack cell surface markers of the hematopoietic lineage. Although BMSCs are considered to be a promising therapeutic strategy, our preliminary data demonstrate that Lung mesenchymal stem cells (LMSCs) are superior to BMSCs with regard to host protection and bacterial clearance. However, their biological properties and therapeutic potential in bacterial pneumonia-induced sepsis have not been explored. Therefore, the goal of the investigation is to explore the biological properties, therapeutic potential and the immunomodulatory properties of stem cell antigen positive LMSCs (Sca1+ LMSCs) in a preclinical model of pneumonia-induced sepsis. Our hypothesis is that the lung derived Sca1+ LMSCs induce host protection against K. pneumoniae pneumonia-induced sepsis via interaction with neutrophils because, selective depletion of neutrophils results in substantial impairment in the clearance of K. pneumoniae from the lungs. To test our hypothesis, we propose two specific aims. Aim 1: To explore whether LMSCs can induce host protection against Klebsiella pneumoniae infection (in vivo): and Aim 2: To investigate whether LMSCs can modulate PMN function (in vitro). The application proposes a proof-of- concept study to determine the role of LMSCs in bacterial pneumonia. Successful completion of these exploratory studies will lay the foundation for future translational initiatives in pneumonia-induced sepsis patients."
"9432706","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Interleukin-9 (IL-9) is a pleuripotent cytokine that leads to altered gene expression and cellular function in hematopoietic and structural cell populations. IL-9 is most efficiently produced by innate lymphoid cells, and a specialized subset of T helper cells termed Th9 cells. Importantly, IL-9 has a role, in both humans and mouse models, in asthma, food allergy, ulcerative colitis, and anti-tumor immunity. Using Th9 cells as a model for understanding the regulation of the Il9 gene, we and several other laboratories have identified transcription factors that are important for the expression of the Il9 locus. Yet, there is still very little understood about Il9 regulatory elements and that knowledge will not only provide insight into how the gene is transcribed, but also in providing a framework for determining how human polymorphisms might impact gene expression, immunity, and disease susceptibility. In this small project we will define the function of a putative Il9 regulatory element, termed CNS-25, in both murine and human cells that we identified using bioinformatics approaches. In Aim 1 we will take several approaches to characterizing CNS-25 including p300 ChIP-seq in mouse Th9 cells, performing ChIP assays in human Th subsets, and using CRISPR-Cas9 in primary human T cells to mediate mutation and Cas9-p300-directed transactivation of the locus. In the second Aim we will utilize already- generated mice that lack CNS-25 to define the requirement for this element in Th9 cells, and extend those studies to other IL-9-expressing cells including NKT cells and innate lymphoid cells. We will further test the role of CNS-25 in controlling IL-9-dependent disease in a model of allergic lung inflammation. Together, these Aims will define new mechanisms of IL-9 regulation and provide potential targets for understanding the regulation of this important cytokine in human immune responses."
"9397560","ABSTRACT Lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) is a rare, low grade neoplasia affecting primarily women of childbearing age. LAM is characterized by the nodular proliferation of SMA and HMB-45 positive LAM cells throughout the lung, producing cystic destruction and respiratory insufficiency. Mutations in the tsc2 or tsc1 genes leading to activation of the mTOR pathway underlie the disease. LAM cells express mainly progesterone receptors (PRs) rather than estrogen receptors; however the role of PRs in the disease has not been investigated. Preliminary studies using a new, well characterized, sporadic-LAM-derived LAM cell line (LAM1) which expresses PRs suggested that the progesterone (P4)/PR axis stimulates LAM cell proliferation, extracellular matrix (ECM) proteinases expression, and pericellular proteolysis, all independently of mTOR activation, whereas mifepristone, a P4 antagonist, abolishes these effects. In a separate pilot study we found that TSC2 transfer suppresses PR expression in LAM1 cells. Additionally, we found that a LAM cell subpopulation expresses PLAP (placental alkaline phosphatase) and preliminary studies suggested a direct correlation between PR positivity and level of secreted PLAP. Finally, intratracheal delivery of LAM1 cells to ovariectomized immunodeficient female mice receiving P4 resulted in LAM-like features undistinguishable from human pulmonary LAM. Based on these observations we hypothesize that: A. the P4/PRs axis contributes to the pathogenesis of LAM by stimulating LAM cell malignant behavior and lung cystic destruction; B. PR expression in LAM results from lack of TSC2-mediated PR transcription repression. C. PLAP levels in serum are a marker for PR positive (PR+) LAM cell burden; and D. concomitant blockage of mTOR and the P4/PR axis is more effective in preventing/ameliorating LAM manifestations in an orthotopic mouse model that blockage of mTOR alone. To test these hypotheses we specifically propose: 1. A To determine the involvement of the P4/PR axis in the promotion of LAM cellular features associated with a low grade neoplastic behavior, including LAM1 cell proliferation, death, production of ECM proteolytic enzymes, etc. 1. B To determine the involvement of the P4/PR axis in the development of pulmonary LAM-like disease in an orthotopic mouse model by quantifying LAM cell burden, cystic destruction, and metastatic dissemination. 1. C To determine the effect of the P4 antagonists mifepristone and lonaprisan on LAM cell low grade neoplastic behavior in vitro and in vivo using the same read outs presented in sub-aims A and B. 2. To determine the effect of TSC2 transfer on pr transcription by LAM1 cells using qPCR, promoter reporter assays and ChIP analysis. 3. To assess whether PLAP level is a marker of PR+ LAM cell burden by determining the potential in vitro and in vivo correlation between PR+ LAM cell burden and PLAP levels in medium and serum. 4. To compare the effectivity of rapamycin alone versus rapamycin plus a P4 antagonist in the treatment of LAM-like disease in an orthotopic mouse model. The experimental protocol will be modeled on that presented in aim 1 B, with same read outs."
"9529139","Project Summary/Abstract 1 This proposal details a 5-yr plan to prepare the candidate, Juan C. Cardet MD, for a career as an 2 independent, translational investigator positioned to impact our understanding of asthma. The aim is to clarify 3 the relationship between enterolactone and asthma through complementary clinical and basic strategies.  4 Lignans are dietary, plant-derived chemicals with anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. Enterolactone  5 is the end product of human gut bacterial metabolism of lignans. Differences in gut microbiome composition  6 categorize patients into high- vs. low-enterolactone producers. This group reported concentration-dependent  7 inverse associations between enterolactone and asthma in a nationally-representative cohort (NHANES); but  8 this study is limited by its cross-sectional design and incomplete clinical characterization. We hypothesize  9 that enterolactone's inverse relationship with asthma is driven by its anti-inflammatory and anti- 10 oxidative properties. The candidate will clarify whether enterolactone has a clinically-evident relationship 11 with asthma by analyzing data from the NHLBI Severe Asthma Research Program's (SARP) prospective 12 study. As a founding partnership in SARP, our group has access to stored biospecimens and participants' 13 clinical, biochemical, and physiological data collected during 3 years of follow-up. Further, the candidate 14 will employ in vitro and in vivo approaches to determine enterolactone's effects on human airway structural 15 cells and murine models of asthma. Preliminary data by Cardet et al suggest that enterolactone may have 16 anti-inflammatory effects on A549 human airway epithelial cells, observations this group will extend through 17 this proposal. Clinical findings will steer the focus of laboratory experiments, and reversely, discoveries at the 18 bench will generate clinical questions. At this project's conclusion, the candidate will be skillful with (1) 19 sophisticated biostatistical analyses on clinical datasets such as SARP's; and with designing, conducting, and 20 interpreting experiments on (2) airway structural cells (3) and murine models of asthma. 21 During the award period, the candidate will leverage his clinical experience with asthma, regular exposure to 22 NIH research networks, and structured academics at the HSPH's MPH program.

"9446375","PROJECT SUMMARY Myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury is a leading cause of death in both males and females in the United States. Cardioprotective mechanisms hold promise for lessening this burden, but few experimental discoveries have translated successfully into effective therapeutics. Nitric oxide, produced endogenously or administered exogenously, has been identified as an essential component of many different cardioprotective pathways. Our recent findings suggest that the S-nitrosation (SNO) of cysteine thiols is essential for nitric oxide-dependent protection in female hearts, which exhibit higher baseline SNO levels compared to males and associated with this, greater protection from ischemia-reperfusion injury. SNO levels are regulated by S-nitrosoglutathione reductase (GSNOR), which catabolizes protein SNO, and we have evidence to suggest that GSNOR is a key mediator of protection in the heart. We have also identified two additional targets (TRIM72, mitochondrial proteins) that are critical for the SNO-mediated ischemic stress response in male and female hearts, but specific mechanisms for reducing cell death and potential sex differences are not known. As such, a significant knowledge gap exists regarding a number of fundamental questions related to the physiological and pathophysiological role(s) of SNO signaling in male and female hearts. To address this knowledge gap, we have developed a number of novel methods for the identification and quantitation of specific in situ SNO modification sites in the heart. In the present application, we propose to use these methods in tandem with in vivo and ex vivo models of myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury and newly developed and emerging methodologies, like in vivo stable isotope labeling by amino acids in mammals (SILAM) to assess protein turnover, quantitative mass spectrometry, and metabolomics analysis. These approaches will be used to enhance our mechanistic understanding of SNO signaling in sex-dependent cardioprotection through the following specific aims: 1) define the role of TRIM72 as a protective target of SNO during ischemia-reperfusion injury, 2) define the protective role of SNO-modified mitochondrial proteins during ischemia-reperfusion injury, and 3) define the role of GSNOR in mitigating nitrosative stress during ischemia-reperfusion injury. If completed successfully, the aims of this proposal will advance our mechanistic understanding of protein SNO signaling in myocardial ischemia- reperfusion injury and cardioprotection. These studies will also provide valuable insight into how SNO-based approaches may be targeted for the therapeutic treatment of ischemic heart disease in both males and females."
"9410506","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Primary focal and segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) is a common cause of end-stage renal disease. Many of these patients are refractory to current treatments and primary FSGS often recurs after kidney transplantation. There is now a consensus that many cases of primary and recurrent FSGS are driven by circulating permeability factors that induce leakiness in the glomerular filtration barrier and ultrastructurl changes in podocytes. Some rare non-recurring genetic forms of FSGS are associated with gain-of-function mutations in Ca2+-permeable TRPC6 channels, resulting in chronic Ca2+ overload. Our central hypothesis is that increased podocyte TRPC6 activity drives pathology in FSGS, and this occurs in response to circulating permeability factors in primary FSGS, and possibly in response to hyperfiltration in secondary FSGS. If so, inhibition of TRPC6 could be a broadly useful therapeutic approach for FSGS of several etiologies. We also propose that primary FSGS can be caused by multiple circulating permeability factors with distinct but synergistic modes of action that converge on podocyte TRPC6. This research will focus on two circulating factors, TNF and suPAR, that have been implicated in some clinical studies and case reports. Our preliminary studies indicate that sera from several recurrent FSGS patients cause profound changes in podocyte TRPC6 channels, including markedly increased TRPC6 activation by mechanical stimuli, and increased expression on the podocyte cell surface. These sera also cause loss of podocin, which can explain increased mechanical activation of TRPC6. Some of these sera also evoke increases in ?3-integrin. The activity in sera from two recurrent FSGS patients taken during relapse and remission correlates with the patient's clinical status. Similar changes in TRPC6 gating and podocin were seen in glomeruli isolated from chronic PAN-treated rats, a model of secondary FSGS, and in podocytes treated with suPAR. TNF also increases TRPC6 activity in podocytes, but probably through mechanisms distinct and additive with those of suPAR. Here we will characterize modulation of endogenous podocyte TRPC6 channels by a larger sample of recurrent FSGS sera and we will determine if TNF and/or suPAR are required for their effects on podocytes. We present data showing that both of these factors contribute to activity in one of the recurrent FSGS serum samples. We will also examine transduction pathways whereby FSGS sera, suPAR, and TNF modulate TRPC6 channels. We will also examine changes in podocyte TRPC6 gating and maximal currents in in vivo mouse models of FSGS, using novel electrophysiological methods that we developed for our studies of podocin and chronic PAN nephrosis. Finally, we will also determine if TRPC6 knockout protects glomerular function in mice with albuminuria evoked by LPS, and in a transgenic mouse with albuminuria due to elevated circulating low molecular weight suPAR. The results could provide a strong rationale for drug discovery programs based on inhibition of mechanical and/or chemical activation of TRPC6 channels."
"9394799","Project Summary We use color to help identify and select objects (e.g., pick the ripest fruit, find our car in a large parking lot). For color to be useful in this way requires that it support selections that correlate well with object-intrinsic surface reflectance. This is not trivial, because the spectrum of the light reflected from an object confounds surface reflectance and illumination. The illumination dependence leads to ambiguity: changes in the spectrum of the reflected light can arise from changes in object reflectance, changes in illumination, or both. Ambiguity of the general sort that underlies object color perception is also characteristic of other aspects of perception, as well as of higher levels of language and cognitive processing. Studying object color provides a model system for making advances that may have applicability beyond the immediate content domain of color. Human color vision is thought to exhibit considerable color constancy. Classically, this is conceived of as the partial stabilization of object color appearance across changes in illumination. In quantitative appearance-based studies of constancy, observers typically adjust the color of one stimulus so that its appearance matches that of another, across a change of illumination. The study of color appearance provides the foundation for the field's current understanding of constancy. Despite the value and intrinsic interest of appearance measurements, however, it is critical to recognize that characterizing the stability of color appearance does not directly tell us how color supports selection: an object could look different across a change in illumination without the difference impairing accurate selection. This would, for example, be the case if a person also perceived the illumination and combined information about the illuminant with object color appearance, perhaps similarly to the way in which we can recognize a bicycle across changes of pose while still apprehending that it looks different in each pose. Understanding constancy requires going beyond appearance and measuring directly how color is used to select objects. The proposed experiments will measure color- based selection across changes of illumination in naturalistic tasks and i) test whether performance is predicted by the visual system's stabilization of color appearance; ii) measure the relative weight placed on color for object selection when other cues are available, and test whether this weight is adjusted dynamically according to the relative quality of the color information; and iii) measure learning in response to feedback provided during color-based selection, and test the generality of this learning."

I am at the beginning of my first faculty appointment, and find that this time is a unique one in which I have the opportunity to broaden my skills in the area of immunology. My main goal during the time of the K08 award is to develop expertise in state of the art experimental immunology. I will achieve this via didactic instruction, accompanied by mentorship from several virologists and immunologists in the context of the proposed research project examining the role of CD4 T cells in preventing Rift Valley fever virus encephalitis. My primary mentor, Paul Spearman, MD, is a viral immunologist as well as a physician scientist and my division director. As a career and science mentor, he will guide my research progress over the time of the award, facilitate advisory committee meetings, and provide career development assistance including R01 proposal development and review. In the next 5 years I plan to capitalize on these newly gained skills to establish myself as an expert in studies of the interaction between host immune responses and emerging viruses. Environment: My appointment is in the Division of Pediatric Infectious Disease, Department of Pediatrics in the Emory University School of Medicine. The Department of Pediatrics at Emory is ranked ninth in the 2014 NIH rankings for Departments of Pediatrics for NIH based funding. This Department has an established track record of supporting junior physician scientists. There are numerous resources available to me at Emory for both research and career development. The experiments will be performed in the BSL-3E space at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, where I hold a guest researcher appointment in the Viral Special Pathogens Branch and will have the expert mentorship and support from Christina Spiropoulou, PhD, team lead. Research: Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) is a mosquito borne virus that causes disease in people and animals in Africa and the Middle East. In the past few years several new live attenuated vaccines have become available for use in livestock. The basis of attenuation for all of these vaccines is the deletion/modification of the viral virulence factor, NSs. These Del NSs viruses generate a protective immune response in animals, in that vaccinated animals are protected from challenge with wild-type virus. However, until recently, little was known about which specific components of the immune response were important for this protection. We reported that mice that were depleted of their CD4 T cells developed encephalitis following infection with the Del NSs virus, suggesting that some function of the CD4 T cell was important for providing protection from this virus. In this proposal, we will first determine the mechanism (viral vs. immune mediated) of Del NSs encephalitis in the CD4 depleted mice. Then, since there are at least 5 different types of CD4 T cells with various roles, we will characterize the CD4 T cell subsets that are activated and functional during Del NSs infection and begin to examine each subset individually to determine how they contribute to protection from encephalitis. Finally the role of B cells and antibodies in protection from encephalitis will be defined. These experiments will establish correlates of immunity against RVFV in the mouse model. These data will be used to design future studies targeted at examining immune correlates of protection in humans."

Many of the confounding cardiac effects of obesity overlap with effects of hypothyroidism including mitochondrial dysfunction, disrupted cardiac energetics, and ultimately decreased cardiac contractility. The heart requires highly efficient metabolism to maintain the levels of ATP needed for contractility and pump function. We identified a signaling pathway for transcriptional regulation in the heart by MED13 and found that this pathway plays a key role in modulating energy homeostasis. Our preliminary studies for this proposal show that altering cardiac transcription by MED13 significantly alters metabolic gene expression, metabolite production and cardiac function, prompting us to develop the necessary tools to identify the mechanism for MED13 function in vitro and in vivo. The objective of this application is to decipher the physiological role of MED13-dependent transcriptional regulation of cardiac reprograming in response to obesity and altered thyroid hormone levels. We hypothesize that MED13 functions to inhibit cardiac transcriptional reprogramming in obesity and hypothyroidism. The specific Aims designed to test this hypothesis using MED13 gain- and loss-of-function mice are: Aim 1: To analyze the molecular mechanistic action for MED13 regulation of cardiac energetics in response to obesity. The experiments planned will test the hypothesis that MED13 integrates metabolic signaling events in the heart, functioning as a brake to regulate transcriptional reprogramming. We will utilize in vivo and in vitro models of obesity to assess changes in cardiac gene expression, mitochondrial function, metabolomics profile and key signaling pathways that are regulated by MED13. Aim 2: To define MED13- dependent regulation of cardiac remodeling in response to chronic hypothyroidism. The proposed experiments are designed to test the hypothesis that MED13 suppresses transcriptional reprograming in response to chronic hypothyroidism. We will utilize a similar experimental approach as in Aim 1 to dissect MED13-dependent cardiac effects of TH signaling in vitro and in vivo. These studies will provide mechanistic insights into the regulatory network linking cardiac reprograming in obesity and hypothyroidism. The new insights will provide opportunities for therapeutic modulation of cardiac diseases with disrupted transcriptional programing, altered cardiac energetics and decreased function. ."
"9469199","Project Summary The cerebellum is essential for the production of smooth and accurate movements. While much is known about the neurophysiology of cerebellar neurons, our understanding of the mechanistic relationship between cerebellar output and movement is limited. Two prominent hypotheses attempt to explain the function of cerebellar output in motor control: that it operates as a motor command, or as a forward model for state estimation. The motor command hypothesis predicts that cerebellar output contributes to movement directly, while the forward model hypothesis suggests that cerebellar output encodes a prediction that is utilized by downstream motor centers. Previous manipulations of cerebellar output lacked cell-type specificity and used reversible lesions that lasted much longer than a single movement, preventing any causal test of whether cerebellar output functions as a motor command or forward model. To address these limitations, this proposal utilizes a kinematic closed-loop (kCL) system for optogenetics, in which stimulation is triggered by the real-time kinematics of skilled reach behavior in mice. Combining this system with cell-type specific opsin expression in the Interposed Nucleus (IN), the cerebellar nucleus most involved in reaching movements, will allow for short- term, reversible manipulation of cerebellar output at specific kinematic locations of a single reaching movement, differentiating fundamental hypotheses of cerebellar contributions to motor control."
"9388349","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In this competing renewal application, we propose to continue and extend our investigations on rod and cone signaling pathways in the retina by focusing on synaptic circuits responsible for receptive field (RF) organization in retinal ganglion cells (GCs). The goal is to understand the space-time RF properties of different types of mouse GCs in scotopic and photopic conditions, and to identify specific synaptic pathways underlying the adaptation-dependent differences in GC RF profiles. There are two specific aims. The first aim will study linear space-time RF profiles of various types of GCs in scotopic and photopic conditions, and to determine the degrees of adaptation-dependent differences in each type of GCs, thereby obtaining a comprehensive catalog of mouse GC types by correlating the spike responses to nonlinear whole-field light steps, cell morphology and linear spatiotemporal receptive field (RF) and mosaic profiles. The second aim will determine contributions of various rod and cone pathways to the spatiotemporal RF profiles of the GCs, and to identify the roles of specific rod and cone pathways in the adaptation-dependent RF differences of individual types of GCs. We will employ the powerful, stable and high throughput multielectrode array (MEA) techniques and the conventional single cell recording methods, in conjunction with the linear white-noise binary checkerboard and the nonlinear whole-field light stimulus protocols to study the spatiotemporal RF profiles of various types of GCs. Our research will provide important mechanistic insights onto the spatiotemporal filtering capacity and RF organization of retinal GCs that can be used to guide future investigations on circuit development and maintenance in healthy retinas, as well as on retinal circuit dysfunctions under various diseased states such as retinitis pigmentosa, congenital stationary night blindness and glaucoma. Knowledge obtained will be useful for developing new gene/drug therapies for retinal disorders and for designing effective retinal prosthetic devices."

"9406329","In this proposal, we address the enormous challenges common complex diseases pose for genomic analysis and the enormous opportunities surmounting them offers for advancing healthcare. The common genetic disorders proposed for study here are believed to have extreme locus heterogeneity, requiring the analysis of large numbers of samples to comprehensively identify the genomic variants underlying them. We propose that a combination of deep population studies and joint analysis of SNPs, indels, and structural variants both in coding and noncoding regions will provide the next level of understanding of common genetic disorders. Whole genome sequencing (WGS) will be critical to this next-generation approach to the genomics of complex disease. WGS will need to be accompanied by the technical ability to generate and handle very large data sets, a particular focus and strength of NYGC. WGS will also need to be accompanied by new statistical tools and algorithms, which will be developed by the strong core group committed to this proposal.  An overarching goal of this proposal, one that capitalizes on the power of WGS, is to identify disease- associated variants at the individual nucleotide level. In many cases pathogenic mutations fall in noncoding regions of the genome, which can only be fruitfully explored with WGS. A major effort will be put into building new computational strategies to functionally annotate noncoding transcribed sequences, and to build new datasets to enable such strategies, opening new frontiers of understanding of disease-related regulatory variants. We will explore a wide spectrum of human variation using the WGS platform, including rare variants of modest to large effect, de novo variants of large effect, and common variants of small effect. We will combine available RNA and epigenomic datasets to predict modes of action of risk and identify protective alleles. These results, combined with the integration of environmental and clinical data, will enhance our understanding of genetic risk for common disease and lay the groundwork for utilization of personal genomics in disease prevention and treatment, including the delineation of pathways for drug development.  Many of the population cohorts proposed for study are from New York, which harbors the most diverse population in the world. Analyzing diverse populations is a critical component of comprehensive common disease analysis, as effect sizes of individual alleles are believed to vary in different populations due to gene- gene interactions. Using the genetic admixture present in different populations from NY and throughout the United States, we will conduct the first systematic study of these interaction effects in many phenotypes.  These aims will be accomplished through widespread collaborations, with genomicists, physicians, and patients, organized through a focused team at NYGC. They will be enriched by the collaboration and support from independent Foundations."
"9599797","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):Emerging evidence suggests the heuristic model that both HIV/AIDS and several forms of drug abuse affect the brain via free radical damage involving the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS, producing oxidative stress) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS) such as nitric oxide (NO, resulting in nitrosative stress). For example, both HIV- associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND) and methamphetamine appear to produce neuronal damage via oxidative and nitrosative stress (Cadet and Krasnova, 2007). However, the cellular and molecular targets of this free radical stress remain largely unknown. These unknown protein targets are a major challenge for the field and need to be identified in order to develop both Biomarkers of disease and to allow screening for new therapies to prevent corruption of these targets by free radical stress. Here, I propose an innovative approach using newly emerging Mass Spectrometry (MS) techniques to identify the posttranslational modifications (PTMs) of proteins resulting from such nitrosative- and oxidative-induced redox stress and hence identify new protein targets affected by AIDS and drug abuse. Heretofore, it has not been possible to identify the full range of proteins undergoing PTMs due to nitrosative and oxidative stress, but new MS techniques should allow this identification. These newly identified target proteins are expected to serve as Biomarkers of the disease process and also should allow us to direct future therapeutic intervention by discovering new pathogenic pathways."
"9395203","Project Summary/Abstract: Nearly 1 in 5 patients receiving community-based long-term care (CB-LTC) services transition to institutionalization in a nursing home within 3 years. CB-LTC patients who are institutionalized incur nearly $57,000 more per year in healthcare costs, have a significant reduction in quality of life, and higher mortality rates. Commonly, the downward spiral in health that results in institutionalization among vulnerable older adult patients starts with increased utilization of emergency room (ER) services and more frequent hospitalizations. Once an older adult is hospitalized, risk for institutionalization in nursing home is significantly higher. Because hospitalizations and ER visits often precede costly nursing home admissions, understanding risk factors? especially modifiable factors?for these outcomes is critical. However, there is limited research exploring the impact of objectively measured functional impairment on healthcare and other service utilization in the CB-LTC population. The purpose of the proposed study is to explore the effect of functional impairment on key health outcomes for older adults in CB-LTC settings, including emergency department use, hospitalizations, and nursing home admissions. The aims of this study are to: 1) Evaluate if impaired physical function is associated with frequency and timing of ER, hospital, and nursing home utilization in CB-LTC patients 2) Test whether including measures of functional impairment significantly improves prediction of ER visits, hospitalizations, and nursing home admissions in CB-LTC patients 3) Evaluate differences in patient factors and rehabilitation utilization between CB-LTC patients who experience functional decline and those who maintain or improve physical function over 1 year. The data for this proposed study will be extracted from a unique database of linked physical function, claims, and electronic medical record data on 1600 CB-LTC patients in a single clinic network. This study will use descriptive statistics, multi-level modeling, Poisson regression, and Cox- Proportional hazards regression analysis to analyze the data. The knowledge gained from this study will help us to understand the impact that impaired physical function has on healthcare utilization and outcomes for CB- LTC patients. This information will help clinicians and policy-makers as they develop interventions and services for this vulnerable patient population."
"9386768","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Significance. Acute lung injury (ALI) is major cause of mortality and morbidity. Our goal is to define mechanisms that might lead to a cure. We will focus on alveolar mitochondrial mechanisms, which are poorly understood. In ALI, mitochondrial dysfunction might underlie alveolar dysfunction, leading to lung injury. The dysfunction might follow loss of mitochondrial Ca2+ buffering in which Ca2+ diffuses from cytosol to mitochondrial matrix across the mitochondrial Ca2+ uniporter (MCU), preventing proinflammatory increase of the cytosolic Ca2+ (cytCa2+), hence protecting against injury. Better understanding of these mechanisms might lead to restoration of mitochondrial Ca2+ buffering by MCU as a therapy for LPS-ALI. Proposal. We propose the novel hypothesis that mitochondrial Ca2+ (mitCa2+) determine surfactant secretion, because the mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake increases ATP and H2O2 production. In LPS-ALI, sustained cytCa2+ increase causes failure of mitochondrial Ca2+ buffering leading to the activation of the Ca2+-dependent phosphatase, calcineurin, which in turn, dephosphorylates and activates the mitochondrial fission protein, DRP1. The resulting mitochondrial fission leads to abrogation of MCU. Calcineurin also promotes actin depolymerization. Together these effects induce alveolar dysfunction as reflected in loss of surfactant secretion. Specific Aims. The specific aims are to determine the role of the MCU in alveolar surfactant secretion (Aim 1) and to determine the extent to which loss of MCU exacerbates lung injury in LPS-induced ALI (Aim 2). We will establish the role of the MCU as a specific Ca2+ channel, as well as its role in surfactant secretion. We will evaluate molecular mechanisms underlying the loss of mitochondrial Ca2+ buffering in LPS-ALI and we will consider bone-marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cell (BMSC)-based therapeutic approaches aimed at reinstating Ca2+ buffering by mitochondria damaged alveoli as a strategy for lung repair. Approach. We will achieve these aims by live confocal and two-photon microscopy of isolated perfused mouse lungs and by studies in isolated alveolar type 2 (AT2) cells. Our determinations will include: (1) cytCa2+ and mitCa2+ in intact alveoli and in isolated AT2 cells; (2) regulation of surfactant secretion by single cell imaging through determinations of Ca2+, ATP, H2O2 and the F-actin fence; (3) MCU and Ca2+ buffering in endotoxin ALI through lung and AT2 cell expressions of specific mutants and siRNA; (4) Expression of MCU mutants in BMSCs to test the hypothesis that MCU restitution re-instates mitochondrial Ca2+ buffering; (5) MCU overexpression by mitochondrial transfer as a means to protect against LPS-ALI. Preliminary data. We show (1) MCU regulates cytCa2+ and mitCa2+ and surfactant secretion, (2) endotoxin ALI blocks mitochondrial Ca2+ buffering by downregulating MCU through activation of DRP1, and that (3) while alveolar transfection of a mutant MCU worsens mouse survival in endotoxin ALI, expression of a fill length MCU increases mouse survival. These and other preliminary data on our measurement strategies support feasibility of the project. Impact. This project will provide the first systematic understanding of the role of the MCU as a determinant of alveolar function. The extent to which loss of the MCU exacerbates ALI, and the extent to which MCU reinstatement promotes lung repair will be understood for the first time. Outstandingly new understanding of the pathogenesis of ALI will be achieved."
"9407143","Project Summary/Abstract  Voltage-gated Na+ channels (Nav) are essential for normal atrial excitability and function, as evidenced by the strong link between dysfunction in the primary cardiac Nav alpha subunit (Nav1.5) and atrial arrhythmias. In particular, congenital or acquired defects in Nav that promote inappropriate ?late? Na+ current (INa,L) commonly result in atrial as well as ventricular arrhythmia. While increased late INa has been linked to atrial fibrillation (AF) in patients and in animal disease models, little is known about the underlying pathways for dysregulation. Moreover, the potential of INa,L as a therapeutic target in AF, while viewed with optimism, remains controversial and difficult to assess due to nonspecific nature of pharmacological agents and limitations of available animal models.  Nav1.5 is tightly regulated within local signaling domains that control channel post-translational modification. Nav1.5 phosphorylation is an important pathway for modulating channel function and level of INa,L. In ventricle, changes in Nav1.5 phosphorylation have been linked by our group and others to arrhythmogenic INa,L. In contrast, the roles for Nav1.5 phosphorylation in atria are unknown and essentially unstudied. In fact, despite its clear role in atrial function and atrial arrhythmias we know essentially nothing regarding the molecular mechanisms that control atrial INa phosphoregulation. Perhaps more surprising, almost nothing is known about the pathways underlying Nav1.5 dephosphorylation, in either atria or ventricle.  We have identified a novel pathway for specific regulation of atrial INa,L by CaMKII with an important role in arrhythmogenesis. Our preliminary data indicate that this pathway includes a previously unappreciated negative regulatory axis for Nav1.5 mediated by protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A). Furthermore, our new data support that PP2A-dependent antagonism of CaMKII phosphorylation occurs within a macromolecular complex organized by ankyrin-G. Finally, we provide initial evidence that this regulatory pathway is altered in animal models and human AF. Our long-term goal is to define the molecular pathway for CaMKII-dependent phosphoregulation of Nav1.5 in atrial myocytes, to understand the role of this pathway in AF, and test whether it may be manipulated for therapeutic benefit. Our central hypothesis is that dysfunction in the PP2A- dependent regulatory axis exacerbates imbalance in Nav1.5 phosphoregulation induced by CaMKII hyperactivity, leading to increased INa,L and ultimately increased AF susceptibility downstream of defects in Ca2+ homeostasis. We will: 1) Define the molecular pathway controlling CaMKII-dependent phosphorylation of atrial Nav1.5; 2) Determine the role of atrial INa phosphoregulation in modulating atrial Ca2+ homeostasis, excitability, and function; and 3) Determine the impact of Nav1.5 phosphoregulation in AF susceptibility and progression. We assert that a fundamental understanding of atrial INa regulation and downstream function is essential for both our understanding of AF mechanisms and the rational design of new therapies. "
"9206489","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): E-cigarettes and related technologies offer an important potential avenue for reducing the death and disease resulting from cigarette smoking. However, relatively few controlled investigations have been conducted to assess the influence of e-cigarette contents on product use and concurrent smoking of conventional cigarettes. It is important to determine how the contents of e-cigarettes influence their use and whether the absence of constituents in e-cigarettes that are present in conventional cigarettes provides a barrier to acceptability for smokers who may have become dependent on these constituents in conventional cigarettes. Continued use of conventional cigarettes along with e-cigarettes, which currently characterizes a substantial proportion of e- cigarette use, will attenuate any harm reduction associated with switching from combustible cigarettes to e- cigarettes. Cigarette addiction critically involves a dependence on nicotine, but it is likely that other tobacco constituents contribute to dependence. Mounting evidence implicates non-nicotine tobacco alkaloids, or NNTAs (including anabasine, anatabine, nornicotine and myosmine) in tobacco dependence. These alkaloids have been shown to augment the reinforcing effects of nicotine in animal models and to affect craving in human smokers. E-cigarettes contain variable quantities of nicotine and NNTAs, but there is virtually no information available concerning the role of e-cigarette nicotine or NNTA content in influencing the concurrent use of cigarettes and e-cigarettes, when smokers attempt to make a transition from conventional combustible cigarettes to e-cigarettes. Additionally, it is not known whether the presence of nicotine and NNTAs in e- cigarettes may sustain dependence, making it difficult to relinquish these products, as well as potentially increasing their use among adolescents. The proposed study will assess the effects of e-cigarette nicotine and NNTA content on cigarette smokers who will be randomized to conditions that manipulate the nicotine and NNTA content of e-cigarettes. Dependence and concurrent use of e-cigarettes and cigarettes will be assessed by a battery of self-report, biochemical, and behavioral indices. The findings from this project will have direct application to regulatory decision-making of the FDA. In so doing, the findings will facilitate the mission of FDA to effectively curb tobacco addiction and make tobacco-related death and disease part of America's past."
"9392554","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Protein S-palmitoylation is a dynamic post-translational modification attaching the 16-carbon fatty acid (palmitate) to the cysteine residues. Genetic studies have shown that 23 of DHHC (Asp-His-His-Cys) domain-containing enzymes are protein palmitoyl acyltransferases (PATs). In addition, some proteins could undergo non-enzymatic autopalmitoylation when bound to palmitoyl-Coenzyme A (CoA) directly. To explore their functions, we have developed novel activity-based chemical probes to covalently label and profile PATs and autopalmitoylated proteins in cells. Through proteomic, biochemical and structural studies, we have discovered that the mammalian TEA domain family (TEAD/TEF) transcription factors (TEAD1-4) are autopalmitoylated proteins. TEADs are essential transcription factors that bind to the transcription co-activators YAP/TAZ and regulate Hippo pathway transcriptional output. Deregulation of TEAD-YAP complex has been linked to defective regeneration and organ size control in liver, skin, colon, and heart. Therefore, understanding this novel regulation will shed light on how fatty acid metabolism and autopalmitoylation regulate transcription factors. Our specific aims of this proposal include: (1) To determine the regulatory mechanism(s) of TEADs autopalmitoylation. (2) To investigate the roles of TEAD palmitoylation in regulating Hippo pathway in vitro and in vivo. (3) To develop small molecule inhibitors of TEAD autopalmitoylation as chemical tools."
"9387456","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Increased levels of misfolded proteins in the heart are associated with a large subset of congestive heart failure (CHF), the final common pathway for virtually all heart diseases and afflicting the life of millions of Americans. Targeted removal of most cellular proteins is primarily done by the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) which degrades a protein via two steps: (1) attachment of a chain of ubiquitin (Ub) to a target protein molecule via a process known as ubiquitination; (2) degradation of the ubiquitinated protein by the proteasome. Cardiac UPS dysfunction is associated with CHF of common causes and a frequently indicated defect is an uncoupling between the two steps, as suggested by the paradoxical co-existence of increased levels of ubiquitinated proteins with elevated or normal proteasomal peptidase activities in diseased myocardium. However, little is known about the molecular basis and pathophysiological significance of the uncoupling. The UBL-UBA family of Ub receptors (Ubiquilin1, Rad23, Ddi1) are purport to recruit ubiquitinated proteins for the proteasome, thereby promoting the coupling. To date, the role of none of these Ub receptors in mammalian hearts is elucidated. Our pilot studies reveal that cardiac Ubqln1 proteins were remarkably increased in human end-stage CHF from ischemic heart disease or dilated cardiomyopathy and in mouse models of desmin-related cardiomyopathy (DRC), a bona fide cardiomyopathy caused by increased expression of misfolded proteins. Our preliminary data also suggest that Ubqln1 promotes proteasomal degradation of ubiquitinated misfolded proteins without altering proteasome activities. Hence, we hypothesize that Ubqln1 up-regulation protects against proteotoxicity in cardiomyocytes by enhancing the recruitment of ubiquitinated misfolded proteins to the proteasome for degradation. A unique set of genetically altered mice as well as human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived cardiomyocytes will be used to interrogate Ubqln1 and proteasome functions in cardiomyocytes to investigate the role of Ubqln1 in the DRC progression, myocardial ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury and post I/R cardiac remodeling in mice and to test the hypothesis that Ubqln1 functions as a shuttling Ub receptor to recruit ubiquitinated misfolded proteins to the proteasome for degradation, thereby protecting against proteotoxicity in cardiomyocytes. The completion of this work is expected to improve our understanding of cardiac protein quality control and provide new molecular targets for developing new strategies to fight cardiac disease with increased proteotoxicity, an increasingly suggested major pathogenic factor of CHF."
"9398147","STRESS SIGNALING PATHWAYS LINKING ENDOTHELIAL INJURY TO GRAFT ARTERIOSCLEROSIS Abstract: The overall hypothesis of this application is that graft arteriosclerosis (GA), the major cause of late cardiac allograft failure, results from a chronic host T cell response to allogeneic graft endothelial cells (ECs) that takes the form of delayed-type hypersensitivity DTH within the vessel wall, locally generating IFN-? which is responsible for driving vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) proliferation and intimal hyperplasia. The clinical correlations and evidence from other experimental systems have suggested that non-immune factors, especially peri-operative stress-induced alterations in the graft, are important contributors to GA pathogenesis. It is proposed and demonstrated experimentally that signals in the graft, primarily from ECs, generated as a result of peri-operative stress can produce mediators that influence T cell activation and differentiation. However, how the peri-operative stresses such as hypoxia couple intracellular signaling pathway to alter ECs alloimmunity and GA is not understood. We have identified SENP1 is a critical mediator of peri-operative stresses. We hypothesize that SENP1 mediates the responses to non-immune peri-operative injuries of graft ECs, increasing T cell-mediated alloimmunity and GA. We propose to explore this hypothesis in the following specific aims: 1) Characterize SENP1-enhanced cytosolic NOX2 activity that mediates peri-operative stress- induced EC immunogenicity and GA progression. We will elucidate the mechanisms by which SENP1 activates NOX2-dependent ROS generation in ECs, define the role of SENP1-NOX2 axis in peri-operative stress-exacerbated GA progression in vivo using EC-specific SENP1 knockout mice and NOX2-deficient as graft donors, and determine how SENP1 couples NOX2 deSUMOylation to EC phenotypic changes. 2) Characterize SENP1-mediated deSUMOylation and disruption of mitochondrial Trx2 activity that augments peri-operative stress-induced EC immunogenicity and GA progression. We will elucidate the mechanisms by which SENP1 attenuates Trx2-dependent mitochondrial function in EC, define the role of mitochondrial SENP1-Trx2 axis in peri-operative stress-exacerbated GA progression in vivo using EC-specific Trx2- transgenic mice expressing WT, SUMO-defective KR mutant and Trx2-SUMO fusion forms as graft donors, and determine how SENP1 couples Trx2 deSUMOylation, mitochondrial dysfunction and ROS production to EC phenotypic changes that modulate T cell responses. 3) Characterize SENP1-ROS-ASK1 signaling pathway that mediates peri-operative stress-induced EC immunogenicity and GA progression. We will determine if cytosolic SENP1-NOX2 and mitochondrial SENP1-Trx2 converge on ASK1 in regulating EC function and GA progression, determine how SENP1-NOX2 and SENP1-Trx2 couple ASK1 to EC phenotypic changes that modulate T cell responses, and test if pharmacological inhibitors of SENP1, NOX2, TRX2 and SENP1 could prevent/ameliorate GA. If successful, this study will provide therapeutic strategies by modulating these two molecules in ECs to reduce GA incidence or delay GA progression."
"9388308","ABSTRACT Antigen receptor genes are assembled from multiple gene segments during early lymphoid cell development in a process termed V(D)J rearrangement. During early B cell development in the bone marrow (BM), V(D)J and VJ joining occurs on the IgH and L chain genes, respectively and is mediated by the RAG recombinase in order to generate a diverse repertoire of antibodies. VH genes are dispersed through 2.5 Mb of the Igh locus, and thus compaction of the Igh locus serves to facilitate spatial proximity between the rearranged DHJH join and distal VH genes. Furthermore, V genes rearrange with very different intrinsic frequencies. However, little is known about the precise looping structure of the Igh locus that leads to locus contraction. Although a small subset of loops have been discerned for the Igh locus, an unbiased examination of locus looping has been unavailable. We, therefore, undertook an analysis of the entire Igh locus using chromosome conformation capture (3C) based methodology in combination with next generation sequencing technologies. This has permitted us to systematically characterize three dimensional (3D) chromatin organization on several genomic scales. Our new studies describe a stepwise process of chromosomal conformational alterations which collaborate to create conditions amenable for the assembly of V-D-J gene segments into contiguous V(D)J exons. We find that the Igh locus is compartmentalized into two unique sub-domains separated by a relatively unstructured region. Comparison of non-lymphoid MEF cells and pro-B lymphocytes has revealed a set of very-long range looping interactions that bridge the chromatin sub-domains and are pro-B cell-specific and Pax5-dependent. These looping interactions are anchored at sites termed I, II, II.5 and III and which appear to be critical facilitators of Igh locus contraction. In addition, we provide new epigenetic and chromatin studies that identify a novel Igh enhancer that interacts with Site I and may play a critical role in locus compaction and/or VH gene expression. Examination of the loop- anchor sites we identified has led to the recognition that locus compaction may be mediated by specific VH promoter-novel enhancer interactions and transcriptionally active regions. We also postulate the non-mutually exclusive proposition that the 3D structure of the Igh locus will influence individual VH gene rearrangement frequencies, favoring VH genes that are brought into close proximity with the rearranged DHJH segments. We propose to systematically characterize locus compaction using specific KO mice in combination with chromatin-loop mapping methods. We will construct pro-B cell lines and mice in which specific sites have been deleted or mutated. The consequences of targeted deletion of loop-anchor sites will be fully explored using 3C chromatin looping assays, 3D FISH, and analysis of B cell development and VH gene usage during V(D)J joining. These studies will form the basis for new insights regarding development of a diverse antibody repertoire."
"9392206","Our Research Program aims to provide new insights into disease pathogenesis and to identify novel targets for therapy through the discovery and subsequent study of novel disease genes implicated in frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) and related disorders. It is unique in that it spans the full spectrum of disease research from gene discovery to therapy development, which allows immediate validation and application of novel research findings. While significant progress has been made in recent years to improve our understanding of the genetics of FTLD and the pathologies underlying this collection of neurodegenerative diseases affecting the frontal and temporal brain regions, its diagnosis can be challenging and no treatments to slow or stop disease progression exist, highlighting the enormous unmet medical need of FTLD patients. FTLD represents 10-20% of all dementias and is clinically important because of its earlier age at onset compared to Alzheimer's disease (AD) and its dramatic impact on core human qualities, including personality, insight and verbal communication. The most common pathological subtype of FTLD is characterized by pathological aggregates of the TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (FTLD-TDP), which is also the main pathological protein in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).  As part of our Research Program we previously identified mutations in progranulin (GRN) and repeat expansions in the chromosome 9 open reading frame 72 (C9ORF72) gene, the two most common causes of FTLD-TDP world-wide. We also identified the transmembrane protein 106 B gene (TMEM106B) as a major genetic modifier of disease onset and/or presentation in FTLD individuals with GRN and C9ORF72 mutations; however, other causal genes and modifying factors must exist.  In this Research Program we will leverage our previous contributions to the field, novel resources and an extensive collection of patient samples to identify novel causal FTLD genes and genetic modifiers. Once new genes are identified, we will capitalize on the flexibility afforded by the R35 mechanism to immediately begin functional studies designed to expedite the translation of genetic discoveries to the patient's bedside. Through the discovery of novel FTLD disease genes and a better understanding of the factors that modify the expression of known disease genes such as GRN and C9ORF72, our Research Program will allow more accurate and earlier diagnosis, provide much needed guidance for clinicians involved in genetic counseling of mutation families, guide the inclusion of patients for future clinical trials and provide important novel insight into FTLD pathobiology. Our Program will also advance the development of biomarkers associated with disease phenotype or progression and provide novel targets for therapies."
"9387469","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Protein kinase C-delta (PKCd) is a signal-regulated enzyme that plays pleotropic roles in the control of cardiac contraction, ventricular remodeling, ischemia-reperfusion injury and cardioprotection. PKCd is traditionally viewed as an allosterically-activated enzyme that exerts membrane-delimited actions at lipid membranes. This conventional model of PKCd activation does not adequately explain PKCd's actions in the heart, where PKCd phosphorylates proteins in non-membrane compartments and exerts diverse (and in some cases opposing) actions in both ischemic injury and cardioprotection. Our previous studies began to address this longstanding dilemma by showing that PKCd is activated in a stimulus-specific manner in cardiomyocytes. We showed that PKCd is phosphorylated at Y311 in cardiomyocytes subjected to oxidative stress (but not G protein-coupled receptor agonists) and that Y311 phosphorylation alters PKCd activity toward the sarcomeric regulatory proteins cardiac troponin I and cardiac troponin T. New data in this application expose the mechanism underlying the Y311-phosphorylation dependent change in PKCd's enzymology. We show that Y311 phosphorylation generates a docking site for PKCd's phospho-Tyr (pY) binding C2 domain. The C2 domain-pY311 interaction in turn controls PKCd activity indirectly by regulating phosphorylation at a novel site (S357) in the catalytic pocket of the kinase domain. The redox-dependent decrease in PKCd-S357 phosphorylation leads to a high level of lipid-independent activity (allowing for the phosphorylation of substrates throughout the cell, not just on lipid membranes) and a change in PKCd's substrate phosphoacceptor site (P-site) specificity. A mechanism to dynamically alter P-site specificity (through a change in kinase domain phosphorylation) is both novel for PKCd and unprecedented for any other kinase. Studies in this application will consider changes in S357 phosphorylation as a mechanism to explain PKCd's distinctive cellular actions during oxidative stress. Aim #1 will use in vitro biochemical approaches to identify the role of the C2 domain and S357 phosphorylation in the control of PKCd signaling to pathways that regulate cardiac growth and apoptosis responses. We will use biochemical approaches to identify growth factor- and ROS-dependent mechanisms that regulate PKCd-S357 phosphorylation and take advantage of genetic approaches and overexpression strategies (including with analogue-sensitive forms of PKCd) to identify substrates/effectors that are uniquely activated by distinct molecular forms of PKCd and (in conjunction with studies Aim 2) examine their role in cardiac injury responses. Aim #2 will use mouse models engineered to express mutant PKCdS357A or PKCdS357E alleles, in place of the WT-PKCd allele, to determine the role of PKCd- S357 phosphorylation/dephosphorylation in cardiac function and cardiac pathogenesis following ischemia- reperfusion injury in vivo. The overarching goal of these studies is to identify novel molecular determinant of PKCd that can be targeted to prevent or mitigate ischemia-reperfusion injury and pathologic cardiac remodeling."
"9389527","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal describes a five-year training program for development of a career in clinical research focusing on outcomes in tetralogy of Fallot (TOF), the most common form of cyanotic congenital heart defect. The candidate is an under-represented minority with training in pediatric cardiology and epidemiology.  The goals of this award are to rigorously conduct this research proposal, to use the training obtained to develop into a mentor to other under-represented minority and, ultimately, to use this award as a vehicle to become a federally funded independent investigator. To achieve these goals, the applicant has set up a training plan that will include mentoring, course work, hands-on conduct of research and didactic educational activities. This project will be carried out under the mentorship of Steven Kawut, MD, MSCE, a leader in pulmonary hypertension and in the study of the right ventricle. Dr. Kawut is a tenured Associate Professor of Medicine and Epidemiology. He has successfully mentored fellows and junior faculty and holds a K24 to support his mentoring endeavors. An advisory committee has been assembled to help guide the candidate's career development.  This application focuses on two main questions related to TOF. First, surgical repair (mandatory in TOF) is electively performed in the first few months of life to avoid cardiac surgery in the neonatal period. However, the severely cyanotic patient that requires intervention in the neonatal period (first month of life) can undergo either a complete surgical repair or a staged repair. The staged repair consists of a neonatal palliative procedure followed by complete repair in subsequent months. Each approach has advantages and disadvantages, and the choice is center-dependent and highly debated. We propose to address this debate by conducting a retrospective cohort study using data from 42 children's hospitals to examine the outcome associated with the two approaches. This comparative effectiveness study will provide generalizable results in a real life population using a highly feasible design that will inform a future trial and will ultimately benefit patients.  Second, the right ventricle (RV) in TOF remodel (changes in size, geometry and function) after surgery in response to surgery itself and from residual lesions resulting from the repair. The clinical response to the RV remodeling is quite variable and the determining mechanisms are poorly understood. We hypothesize that early perioperative RV remodeling represents a critical time period that has a significant impact on the phenotypical variability in TOF. We propose a prospective cohort study of TOF patients to detect adverse RV remodeling in the post-operative period with sensitive imaging markers and circulating biomarkers. We will establish the impact of surgical procedure and early pathophysiologic mechanisms of RV remodeling on clinical outcomes and set up future studies that will eventually lead to improved outcomes in children with TOF.

"9453222","Shiga toxin (Stx) producing E. coli (STEC) are foodborne pathogens that can cause severe morbidity and mortality, including hemorrhagic colitis (HC) and hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) and remain a major challenge for food safety and public health. There are no specific therapeutics or vaccines against infection by bacteria producing these toxins. Shiga toxins are a family of AB5 toxins consisting of an A1 subunit, which depurinates a universally conserved adenine in the ribosome, and a pentamer of identical B subunits, which bind to a glycolipid globotriaosylceramide receptor. E. coli strains producing Shiga toxin 2 (Stx2) are associated with progression to more severe disease than strains producing Shiga toxin 1 (Stx1). The mechanism that accounts for the differences in toxicity of Stx1 and Stx2 is not known. Although several studies suggested a role for the B subunit in the increased toxicity of Stx2, the role of the A1 subunit in the higher toxicity of Stx2 has not been investigated. The proposed studies seek to fill a critical gap in our understanding of Stx toxicity by examining the role of the A1 subunit. We propose that the A1 subunit in combination with the B subunit contributes to toxicity. We recently demonstrated that the A1 subunit of Stx2 has higher affinity for mammalian ribosomes and is more active than the A1 subunit of Stx1 and that differences in surface charge are critical for the interaction of the A1 subunits with ribosomes. We will test the hypothesis that ribosome binding kinetics and catalytic activity, which determine the rate of depurination, contribute to the differential toxicity of Stx1 and Stx2. In Aim 1 we will identify the residues that contribute to differences in surface charge of the A1 subunits and determine if they contribute to the differential activity and toxicity; in Aim 2, we will determine if depurination activity of the A1 subunit contributes to the lethality of Stx2 holotoxin in an animal model; and in Aim 3 we will identify peptides that can bind to ribosome docking surfaces and determine if they reduce toxicity of Stx2 by disrupting its interaction with the ribosome. This approach has already culminated in peptides that inhibit depurination activity of Stx2. We expect that our unique approach, the powerful set of tools we developed, ability to dissect the toxin activity in vitro and in vivo will reveal the factors critical for STEC pathogenesis and will provide a path to new therapy."
"9385709","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Dyslipidemia and the oxidative stress associated with it are among the main risk factors leading to atherothrombosis. Platelet activation plays a key role in atherothrombosis and the subsequent acute coronary syndromes triggered by plaque rupture. Many dyslipidemia- related pathophysiological states are associated with a drastically increased response of platelets to agonists. While the significance of increased platelet reactivity in the pathophysiology of occlusive arterial thrombosis is widely recognized, knowledge of molecular mechanisms leading to enhanced platelet reactivity in vivo during hyperlipidemia has only started to emerge. Involvement of platelet pattern recognition receptors in platelet function has been recently appreciated. We have previously demonstrated that the platelet scavenger receptor CD36 serves as the platelet sensor for oxidative stress and promotes platelet hyperreactivity in dyslipidemia. Recently, we and others have demonstrated that TLRs, another family of pattern recognition receptors with previously unknown role in platelets, can regulate platelet function. Our recent data demonstrate that platelet TLR1/TLR2 and TLR9, alone or in collaboration with CD36, recognize novel altered-self ligands that accumulate in the circulation during oxidative stress and dyslipidemia. Ligation of these receptors activates pathways common to the innate immunity system, and connects this signaling to the integrin activation network in platelets via links that have not yet been established. Generation of biologically-active oxidized lipids and related products is a critical consequence of oxidative stress. According to our studies these molecules represent altered self ligands for platelet pattern recognition receptors. We have previously identified a novel family of oxidized choline glycerophospholipids (oxPCCD36) that serve as high affinity ligands for CD36 and promote platelet hyperreactivity and thrombosis in vivo via CD36. Our recent studies extended this observation to a novel class of products formed via degradation of oxPCCD36 by PLA2. We showed that carboxyalkylpyrrole adducts of proteins and phosphatidylethanolamine are novel ligands for platelet TLRs, are powerful platelet agonists and accumulate in vivo in dyslipidemia. However, the exact molecular mechanisms of receptor recognition, the contribution to thrombosis in vivo of novel ligands and the signaling pathways they induce in platelets are not known. This proposal will address the hypothesis that platelet TLRs, alone or in cooperation with CD36, promote platelet reactivity and the prothrombotic state induced by endogenous ligands generated during oxidative stress."
"9431092","Project Summary Accumulation of the protein amyloid-? is a hallmark of the condition called cerebral amyloid angiopathy, and is observed in approximately 80% of patients with Alzheimer?s disease, a most prevalent cause of dementia. Although dementia is a consequence of loss of neurons, studies show that impairment in the control of blood flow to active regions of the brain occurs before neuronal death is evident. Neurons have a limited capacity to store energy and nutrients necessary for their optimal function, thus relying on the cerebral circulation for delivery of necessary nutrients. One hallmark of the brain circulation is its ability to remarkably control blood perfusion to regions of increased neuronal activity, a process known as functional hyperemia. This localized increase in blood perfusion to match neuronal activity is a consequence of neurovascular coupling (NVC), in which neurons, glial cells (mainly astrocytes) and endothelial cells (EC) act in concert to promote vasodilation of upstream arterioles, shunting blood to active neurons. Functional hyperemia and NVC are known to occur for more than a century, but most of its mediators and cellular effectors remain unknown. Active neurons release a plethora of transmitters that activates astrocytes, a type of non-neuronal cells in the brain. Astrocytes, on the other hand, emit projections that envelop cerebral capillaries, called astrocytic end-feet. Therefore, substances released from activated astrocytes can then act on cerebral capillary EC to signal to the vasculature the metabolic status of a particular neuronal population. Capillary EC do not possess contractile activity, thus control of blood perfusion through a capillary bed will fall on the contractile member of the cerebral microvascular tree: the upstream parenchymal arteriole. For capillary EC to cause dilation of upstream arterioles, it is necessary that a sensor in capillary EC initiates a signal that is rapidly transmitted to upstream arterioles. This project focuses on the effects of one of such signals, the N-Methyl-D-Aspartate receptor (NMDAR) and its role in generating a propagated vasodilatory response from the capillaries to arterioles in the brain. Further, studies proposed here will also investigate how amyloid-? can interfere in this essential process in the brain, as amyloid-? was shown to reduce NMDAR activity in neurons. Thus, it is possible that one of the mechanisms by which amyloid-? impairs NVC in patients with cerebral amyloid angiopathy is by reducing the activity of NMDAR in cerebral capillary EC."
"9521147","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Current treatment modalities for heart failure (HF) are aimed largely at late-stage disease, and do not target primary disturbances in the cardiac myocyte. Increasing evidence indicates that derangements in myocardial fuel catabolism and ATP production contribute to the pathological remodeling en route to HF. This renewal proposal builds upon our long-term pursuit of delineating the molecular regulatory mechanisms that control myocardial fuel metabolism and mitochondrial function in the normal and failing heart. Our previous studies have identified a transcriptional regulatory cascade downstream of the inducible transcriptional co-regulators, PPARgamma coactivator 1 (PGC-1) alpha and beta. We demonstrated that PGC-1alpha and beta are necessary for high level of expression of genes involved in cardiac myocyte mitochondrial energy transduction. Studies conducted over the current funding period used both candidate (PGC-1?/-deficient mice) and unbiased molecular profiling strategies to further define the events that are involved in the development of energy metabolic derangements in early stages of heart failure in mice. The results of these studies have led us to hypothesize that the adult mammalian heart is capable of remarkable energy metabolic plasticity in the context of chronic pathophysiological stress such as pressure overload. In support of this hypothesis, we have identified two new gene regulatory pathways that function independent of PGC-1 signaling to control cardiac myocyte energy utilization pathways in the context of mitochondrial dysfunction, such as occurs in the failing heart. The first candidate is the stress-induced nuclear receptor NR4A1 (NUR77). Our preliminary results indicate that NR4A1, and the related factor NR4A3 (NOR1), serve as stress inducible transcriptional regulators of cardiac myocyte glucose utilization. The second candidate is the estrogen-related receptor gamma (ERRgamma). We have found that ERRgamma is capable of inducing the expression of a broad array of genes involved in mitochondrial energy transduction and ATP synthesis. In addition, ERRgamma activates the expression of genes involved in cardiac myocyte differentiation including adult contractile protein genes, a program that could oppose the classic fetal switch of HF. This proposal is designed to test the hypothesis that the adult mammalian heart is capable of adaptive energy metabolic re-programming via gene regulatory pathways downstream of NR4A1 and ERRgamma. In Aim 1, we will further delineate and compare NR4A1 and NR4A3 target genes and pathways in heart. In Aim 2, cardiac gene targets and pathways downstream of the estrogen-related receptor gamma (ERRgamma) will be defined. Aim 3 is designed to explore the roles of NR4A1/NR4A3 and ERRgamma in the normal, hypertrophied, and failing heart using gene-targeted NR4A1/3 or ERRgamma loss-of-function mice. The long-term goal of this project is to identify metabolic modulator therapeutic targets relevant to the treatment of early stage heart failure."
"9541900","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Asthma is a clinically heterogeneous chronic airway disease which affects 7% of the US population and results in substantial morbidity and healthcare expenditure. Advances in the molecular characterization of asthma have led to the identification of disease subtypes, leading to novel treatment approaches. Many patients with asthma have disease that is driven by type 2 helper T (Th2) cells, immune cells critical for orchestrating inflammatory responses in the lung. Recently, molecules called microRNAs have been identified as critical regulators of T cells. The long-term goal of Dr. Pua is to identify miRNA-mediated regulatory networks in immune responses and to determine their impact on inflammatory lung diseases. The objectives of this proposal are to define the mechanism by which a specific group of microRNAs, called the miR-23 cluster, regulate type 2 immune responses and leverage this knowledge to better understand allergic lung inflammation. Since microRNAs act by inhibiting networks of target genes within a cell, Dr. Pua hypothesizes that individual microRNAs of the miR-23 cluster act together to limit the development and activity of Th2 cells, including those cells which contribute to the pathogenesis of asthma. Dr. Pua will test this hypothesis using three specific aims. In Aim 1, Dr. Pua will determine the network of target genes regulated by the miR-23 cluster, with the hope of identifying novel cellular pathways important for type 2 immune responses. In Aim 2, she will explore how microRNA interactions with their target genes are critical in specifically regulating Th2 cell function. In Aim 3, Dr. Pu will investigate the role of the miR-23 cluster in regulating human T cells as well as immune responses of asthma/allergic airway hypersensitivity as well as infection. This project is relevant to asthma as well as the mission of the NIAID because it explores a novel microRNA-mediated regulatory pathway in Th2 cells and has the potential to uncover new therapeutic avenues involving microRNAs and their target genes.  Dr. Pua is an MD PhD who completed her graduate work in immunology and clinical training in molecular pathology. She is currently a pathology fellow at the University of California, San Francisco, and is applying for a K08 Mentored Clinical Scientist Research Career Development Award. The critical elements of her training plan which will help to support her goal of becoming an academic physician scientist include mentorship by Dr. Mark Ansel, a leading expert in the field of microRNAs in T cells; guidance by a multidisciplinary committee which includes numerous physician scientists as well as leaders in the field of immunology and microRNA biology; coursework in data analysis; attendance at meeting to foster scientific growth and collaboration; and professional development activities. This will provide her the essential foundation to combine her interest with her growing expertise in the molecular regulation of immune responses to the exploration and practice of pathology."

"9470677","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The ventrolateral periaqueductal gray (vlPAG) plays an important role in descending pain modulation. The GABA disinhibition hypothesis proposes that tonic GABAergic neurotransmission at the level of the vlPAG serves to inhibit output excitatory projections, regulating descending analgesic mechanisms. Disinhibition of vlPAG excitatory neurons that project to the rostral ventromedial medulla (RVM) is thought to allow subsequent activation of RVM cells that will project to the dorsal horn of the spinal cord and inhibit nociceptive information processing, resulting in analgesia. Altered vlPAG neural transmission, characterized by a hypoglutamatergic and enhanced GABAergic neurotransmission, is thought to contribute to the development and maintenance of chronic pain. In an attempt to understand this circuit, pharmacology and electrical stimulation of the vlPAG have partially described its role in descending pain modulation, but due to the lack of cell-type specificity, the identity and definitive role of the neurons responsible for descending analgesia remains unclear. Techniques such as chemo- and opto-genetics, in combination with genetic mouse models, allow us to selectively manipulate vlPAG neuronal populations and finally interrogate the role of these in nociceptive processing. Preliminary data demonstrates that we can bidirectionally modulate sensory thresholds via manipulation of this circuit under nave conditions. Our findings support the hypothesis of a local tonic GABAergic control over vlPAG neurons. We hypothesize that reduction of the vlPAG GABAergic tone or stimulation of output glutamatergic neurons that project to the RVM will result in attenuation of thermal and mechanical hyperalgesia, in addition to attenuating spontaneous pain, under a persistent inflammatory pain model. Preliminary results demonstrate that chemogenetic inhibition of local GABAergic (Vgat) or optogenetic stimulation of Vglut2 RVM-projecting vlPAG neurons results in attenuation of inflammation-induced thermal and mechanical hyperalgesia. In brief, the proposed research aims to characterize the descending PAG circuitry at both an anatomical and molecular level and will identify the role of vlPAG GABA and glutamate neurotransmission and vlPAG-RVM projections in persistent inflammatory pain. A precise understanding of vlPAG-RVM circuitry, neuronal subpopulations and the mechanism by which the vlPAG can modulate persistent inflammatory pain may direct future research focused on novel targeted therapies for chronic inflammatory pain."
"9430771","PROJECT SUMMARY  Excess weight is a public health priority for all sectors of the US population and particularly for Black adolescents who have a disproportionately high prevalence of obesity and overweight. Research suggests that consumption of fast food and calorie dense foods prepared outside of the home contribute to a higher body mass index. Black youth are more likely than their White peers to live in low-income communities with a high density of fast food restaurants. There is a need for interventions to help adolescents make healthy choices in these obesogenic environments.  Our clinical work in the Michigan Pediatric Outpatient Weight Evaluation and Reduction (MPOWER) program suggests that adolescents find it difficult to make healthy choices in obesogenic settings, such as fast food restaurants. From our initial MPOWERed Messages study, we found that adolescents welcomed health- related text messages (based on Self Determination Theory and Motivational Interviewing) if they viewed them as personally relevant and if they were received at times when they faced dietary choices. Based on these findings, we hypothesized that delivering messages (tailored to users? preferences and values) at a time and place when they are making a dietary choice (e.g., in a restaurant) would positively influence their selection.  In a first step toward exploring this, we combined our experience in the development of tailored texts for adolescents, with state-of-the-art geo-fencing technology, to develop the Location Initiated Individualized Texts for African American Adolescent Health (LIITA3H) mobile application. This app a) accurately identified when users were in an eating venue such as a restaurant, b) automatically sent culturally relevant messages (based on focus group input from the target population) tailored to user preferences and the menu options at their location with the aim of prompting users to make a healthy choice, and c) allowed users to submit an annotated photo of their food choice. This study demonstrated the app?s acceptability and feasibility, and the accuracy of the technology to deliver tailored messages at the point of purchase. However, we did not pilot test whether receipt of these ?just in time? personalized messages, actually influenced participants? food choices.  This R21 project will focus on 1) enhancing the LIITA3H app by incorporating user input regarding its design and by allowing greater automation in the identification of eating venues, and 2) pilot testing the impact of the app on the number of calories purchased from, and number of visits to, fast food restaurants. This will provide data regarding effect size, and will form the foundation for planning a future randomized trial which would include a larger population and a greater range of eating venues. A better understanding of how receipt of ?just in time? tailored messages, made possible by new location-based technology, alters behavior among a high risk population, will help future efforts to address obesity and other illnesses impacted by lifestyle choices."
"9457988","ABSTRACT Influenza A viruses pose a serious threat to human health, causing seasonal epidemics and occasional pandemics that result in significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. The virulence and pathogenic nature of influenza virus strains vary greatly, and is often determined by the constellation of viral genes. While seasonal influenza viruses cause a mild upper respiratory infection in healthy individuals, highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses (HPAIV) of the H5N1 subtype replicate in the lower respiratory tract, causing fatal viral pneumonia characterized by pulmonary edema and vascular leakage. In addition, H5N1 infections are associated with an uncontrolled activation of host immune responses, which contributes to the severity of disease. The role of viral and host factors in the enhanced virulence and pulmonary immunopathology characteristic of HPAIV infections remain unknown. To this end, we engineered H5N1 viruses with restricted tropism through the incorporation of microRNA (miRNA) target sites into the viral genome. Specifically, we generated an H5N1 virus carrying endothelial cell specific miR-126 target sites (H5N1-126T), such that viral replication was abrogated in endothelial cells without impeding replication in other cell types. In our recent studies, H5N1-126T infected mice and ferrets showed significantly reduced virulence and vascular leakage in the lungs as compared to the control H5N1-ScrbT virus infected group, despite similar viral loads in the lungs of mice and nasal washes of ferrets. To our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate the importance of endothelial cell tropism to H5N1 pathogenesis. The current proposal will (1) determine the consequence of endothelial cell infection to barrier integrity and function, (2) investigate the role of endothelial cell tropism in orchestrating immune responses, and (3) assess the contribution of viral tropism to the pathogenesis of other highly virulent strains including H7N7, 1918 H1N1, and H7N9 in mice and ferrets. The knowledge gained from these studies will help to elucidate the mechanism by which virulent influenza viruses cause severe disease and aid in the development of novel therapeutic strategies against virulent influenza strains. Furthermore, these studies will reveal how viral tropism modulates host antiviral responses and will pave the way for the rational design of novel live attenuated vaccines with restricted tropism."
"9387394","After receiving prior Developmental Funds during the project period as a Developing Core, the Circulating  Tumor Cell Core is presented in this application as an Established Shared Resource. The overarching goal of  this Core, which is fully managed by USC Norris, is to assemble a first-of-its-kind, state-of-the-art, multiplatform  facility for the capture and analysis of peripheral blood circulating tumor cells (CTCs), and to make  leading-edge technology and expertise available to USC Norris members. The Core is led by Amir Goldkorn,  MD, a genitourinary oncologist whose laboratory research focuses on developing the therapeutic and  biomarker potential of circulating tumor cells, telomerase, and cancer stem cells. Dr. Goldkorn is PI of two NCI  R01-funded translational laboratory studies of CTCs in Phase III multi-center cancer trials, as well as several  other peer-reviewed grants for CTC analysis. Dr. Goldkorn?s team developed a novel microfilter technology for  the capture of live CTCs from blood, and his laboratory has been developing and implementing several other  CTC platforms. Under his leadership, the Core employs the leading CTC technologies to analyze samples from  multiple clinical trials in a centralized facility. Such an approach allows for expert faculty and technical expertise  and a reliable and consistent pathway for generating large-scale, reproducible CTC data. This new Shared  Resource?s technical versatility and available clinical material offer unprecedented scientific opportunities for  discovery and validation of new clinical biomarkers, biologic pathways and targets, as well as for optimization  of novel platforms for CTC capture and analysis. Transitioning the facility from a Developing Core to an  established Shared Resource will make CTC services more accessible to the cancer research community and  further cement the growing role of CTC analysis in precision cancer care. Specifically, CTCs have emerged as  valuable prognostic and predictive cancer biomarkers, providing a non-invasive ?window? into disease biology  and progression that can be sampled repeatedly over time from a simple blood draw. Thus, CTC  characterization holds the promise of enabling real-time molecular phenotyping of individual cancer patients?  tumors at diagnosis and throughout treatment, advancing precision medicine in this important and vast patient  group. The Core is therefore fully aligned with the mission and Strategic Plan of USC Norris."

"9469347","Project Summary Understanding the molecular basis of cellular identity in the human brain is a major goal of the BRAIN Initiative and essential for clarifying the cellular origins of diverse brain disorders. This project will use novel, ?top-down? analytical strategies that complement single-cell and single-nucleus methods to define the core transcriptional identities of major cell types in the adult human brain while obviating the need to purify or isolate cells. Our central hypothesis is that covariation between the abundance of cell types and transcripts can be estimated through integrative gene coexpression analysis of intact tissue samples, and this information can be used to construct quantitative cell type definitions, perform mathematical modeling of gene expression, and identify cell type-specific transcriptional differences between biological systems. In Aim 1, we will integrate cell type- specific gene coexpression modules from >60 datasets and >7000 neurotypical adult human brain samples to determine consensus transcriptional profiles of major cell types. These profiles will suggest which major cell types primarily express genes that have been implicated in human brain disorders, identify novel biomarkers, and help to establish the 'ground truth' for assessing the validity of human cell types derived in vitro for disease modeling. We will also leverage highly recurrent gene coexpression relationships to estimate cellular abun- dance and develop predictive models of gene expression in adult human brain samples. These models will im- prove reproducibility through concrete predictions that can be tested in new human brain transcriptomes (in- cluding those from pathological samples) as they become available; they will also lead to new analytical strate- gies that go beyond differential expression analysis to reveal subtle transcriptional perturbations associated with pathology. In Aim 2, we will replicate the goals of Aim 1 in mice and implement a comprehensive effort to identify binary (on/off) expression differences in major cell types between human and mouse brains. In Aim 3, we will assess the extent of regional variation in the transcriptional identities of major CNS cell types in the adult human brain. Expected outcomes include consensus transcriptional profiles of astrocytes, oligodendro- cytes, microglia, neurons, ependymal cells, and endothelial cells; rigorous mathematical models that can accu- rately predict expression levels for thousands of genes in de novo human brain transcriptomes; and new tools and reagents for studying CNS cell types and subtypes. This project is innovative because it challenges the status quo that cells must be physically isolated to study their molecular properties; it also introduces a novel concept and metric called gene expression fidelity for defining cellular identity. Our studies will have a positive impact by providing an unprecedented resource for identifying transcriptional processes that distinguish cell types among human brain regions, species, and disease states, and will contribute directly to our long-term goal of constructing a comprehensive cellular taxonomy of the human CNS from molecular data."

The Summit brings together the leading state legislators and other related state officials that are passionate about issues related to the production of food. The long term goal is to develop state policy makers with broader knowledge of issues related to food, drugs and health that will provide for better policy decisions at the state level to assure the safety, efficacy and security of our food supply. The Summit provides high quality educational programming, opportunities for state legislators to network with FDA officials, scientific experts and each other. History has shown that attendees return to their home state/territory and share the knowledge gained, utilize the networking contacts and are highly influential in policy decisions. Since the states and FDA share similar authorities, missions and responsibilities, expanding the knowledge base and leadership abilities of state legislators assists the FDA in the implementation of their mission. With this Small Scientific Conference Grant, SARL will be able to cover the travel expenses for the best speakers for the Summit. This also helps to free up Summit funds to assist state legislators with travel expenses to attend the 2  day Summit. The Summit has a history of attendance of leaders from more than 90% of the state legislative chambers well as Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. The Legislative Agriculture Chairs Summit began in 2002 through the efforts of a group of state legislators that felt that the divide between food production and members of state legislatures was increasing. They were concerned by the growing disconnect shown by state officials on knowledge of issues important to food production and health. The Summit is non-partisan and targets legislative leadership from all political parties and as well as actively seeking participation from the National Legislative Black Caucus, the National Caucus of Native American State Legislators and the National Foundation for Women Legislators. The 2018 Summit will be held in Kansas City, Kansas, January 5-7. Approximately 40 percent of the agenda is directly related to food, drugs or health care. Regardless of the topic, speakers focus on science based dialogue, and are charged to actively engage the legislators on every topic, seek solutions to the issues and provide attendees with action items."
"9388378","PROJECT SUMMARY Tolerance of kidney allografts has been achieved in nonhuman primates (NHPs) and in humans using a combination of nonmyeloablative conditioning and donor bone marrow transplantation (DMBT) that results in transient donor chimerism. However, mixed chimerism protocols that achieve long term tolerance of kidney allografts in NHPs fail to induce tolerance in recipients of heart allografts. It is well known that some organs, such as kidney and liver, are tolerance-prone while others, such as heart and lung, are tolerance-resistant. In earlier studies using miniature swine, we took advantage of the tolerogenicity of kidney allografts and, through donor kidney cotransplantation, achieved long-term stable tolerance of heart allografts which, if transplanted alone, would have rejected acutely. Mechanistic studies in swine showed that kidney allografts were able to confer tolerance upon co-transplanted hearts by promoting the expansion of regulatory T cells (Tregs). We have now extrapolated those findings to NHPs. By combining a mixed chimerism protocol that induces transient donor chimerism with donor kidney cotransplantation, we have succeeded in achieving long-term, stable tolerance of MHC mismatched heart allografts. These results are the first to demonstrate tolerance induction in NHP heart allograft recipients and the first to show that unresponsiveness to a tolerant-resistant organ can be achieved without durable donor chimerism. Based on preliminary results, we hypothesize that amplifying the contributions of host Tregs in NHP heart allograft recipients undergoing mixed chimerism conditioning will achieve long-term, stable tolerance without the need for kidney cotransplantation or durable chimerism. To test this hypothesis, we will first study the characteristics of Tregs generated by kidney cotransplantation and attempt to identify the cells or cell products within the kidney allograft capable of promoting those Tregs. These results will be applied to our subsequent studies aimed at finding a clinically relevant strategy of Treg amplification that effectively substitutes for simultaneous donor kidney transplantation. Our goal is to develop a Treg-amplified, mixed chimerism protocol that can be rapidly translated to human heart transplant recipients. Of note, results from Project 2, which will use novel but related strategies to achieve tolerance of stringent lung allografts, and Project 3, which will use humanized mice to evaluate novel Treg-stabilizing agents will guide the ongoing design of these experiments."
"9388347","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Perceiving the motion of objects in our environment is critical to many aspects of daily life. Although much is known about the neural basis of visual motion perception, almost all of that knowledge is derived from experiments in which the observer's eyes, head, and body remain stationary. When an observer moves through the environment, the motion of an object on the retina depends on both the movement of the object in the world and the self-motion of the observer. Thus, to estimate the motion of objects in the world, self-motion must be factored into the computations. This capability is critical to daily activities such as driving a vehicle, during which it is important to accurately judge the movement of other objects in the environment, such as other vehicles or pedestrians. As perception of self-motion is known to be degraded in neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's disease and during normal aging, understanding the neural basis of object motion perception during self-motion is of substantial importance to developing therapies for these deficits. We propose a series of experiments that provides the first systematic exploration of the neural mechanisms of object motion perception during self- motion. Aim #1 explores visual mechanisms by which optic flow may be parsed into components related to self-motion and object motion. Behavioral studies have demonstrated perceptual consequences of flow parsing, but the neural basis is unknown. We test the hypothesis that responses of neurons in retinotopic motion areas mediate the perceptual effects of flow parsing Aim #2 employs a novel behavioral paradigm in which macaques are trained to judge object motion during self-motion, and to report their percepts in either world-centered or head-centered coordinates. We hypothesize that both visual and vestibular self-motion signals make important contributions to perception of object motion. By recording from neurons in multiple brain areas during performance of this task, we seek to identify neural correlates of the computations that are used to flexibly represent object motion in either world-centered or head- centered coordinates. The proposed research is directly relevant to the research priorities of the Strabismus, Amplyopia, and Visual Processing program at the National Eye Institute."
"9393695","PROJECT SUMMARY Individuals diagnosed with anxiety disorders are 2-4 times more likely to develop AUD and this comorbid diagnosis is associated with a telescoped progression of AUD and a much worse prognosis in recovery. Despite the clinical significance of this problem, we still lack a full understanding of the neurobiological substrates responsible for the frequent co-occurrence of these disorders. One major obstacle has been the lack of well-validated animal models that reliably engender a behavioral profile that may be indicative of a heightened risk of developing these diseases. To that end, we have re-examined a common rodent model of early-life stress, adolescent social isolation (aSI) and in a series of studies, have generated strong data supporting the face, predictive and construct validity of aSI as a model of vulnerability to anxiety disorders and AUD in male rats, and have used this model to identified profound adaptations in mesolimbic circuits that may contribute to the ?AUD vulnerable phenotype? engendered by this model, including enduring alterations in catecholamine release dynamics in the nucleus accumbens and increased intrinsic excitability in the basolateral amygdala. Despite the promise of this model, several key gaps in our knowledge remain. First, this model has not been carefully validated in female rats. Our preliminary data suggest that it may promote a vulnerable phenotype in females but that this phenotype may be sexually dimorphic. Experiments in Aim 1 will therefore conduct behavioral and neurobiological studies to further validate the utility of the aSI model in females. Second, although aSI alters many behaviors linked with increased risk of AUD, it is not known if aSI actually increases vulnerability in a rodent model of ethanol dependence. Aim 2 will integrate aSI and a well- established rodent model of ethanol dependence (chronic intermittent ethanol vapor, CIE) to test the hypothesis that aSI increases sensitivity to the behavioral consequences of CIE. Complementary neurobiological studies will determine if CIE exacerbates neurobiological adaptations engendered by aSI and test the causal role of these adaptations using pharmacological and chemogenetic interventions. Collectively, these studies will further validate aSI as a model of vulnerability to comorbid AUD and anxiety disorders in male and female rats and may facilitate the discovery of novel treatment strategies that may be particularly effective for individuals suffering from comorbid AUD and anxiety disorders."
"9389519","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This RO1 application requests funds to develop and validate a novel outcome measure targeting the behavioral inflexibility in children with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD). This behavioral domain encompasses a host of closely related clinical sequelae that can be profoundly disabling and are common in IDD such as (a) an overall inflexible temperament or behavioral style that underlies discrete idiosyncratic forms of repetitive and rigid behavior manifestations (e.g., inability to tolerate changes in the environment, stereotyped uses of objects); (b) associated mood and behavior problems that arise when this inflexible temperament and its manifestations cannot be accommodated; and (c) interference with learning and adaptation that stems from rigidity / inflexibility as even treatmen itself can represent intrusion and change for an inflexible child (e.g., a new pill, a new therapy exercise). In recent years there have been large-scale drug trials and small behavioral trials targeting discrete behaviors that fall under the domain of repetitive inflexible behavior. However, the measures included in many of these clinical trials have little to no evidence of their ability o detect change over time. In fact, while several instruments exist that measure the discrete behavioral endpoints of this overall construct of rigidity / inflexibility, no instrument exists tht adequately extends much beyond a behavior checklist approach. The overall objective of this application is to develop and validate a new measure, the Repetitive and Inflexible Behavior Inventory (RIBI), with the primary goal of developing a measure that is sensitive to change over time. The RIBI is designed as a parent report measure for children (ages 3 -18) with IDD. The rationale is that a novel measure is needed to (a) capture the range of repetitive inflexible behaviors that are found in children with IDD across a variety of idiopathic and genetic disorders, (b) measure the functional impact of these behaviors on the family's daily life, and (c) detect change over time when these behaviors are the target of intervention. Thus, the specific aims of this project are to (1) examine the psychometric properties of the RIBI for children and adolescents with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), establishing reliability, factor structure, content and construct validity; (2) evaluate the RIBI's ability to measure change over time in children with ASD; and (3) examine the psychometric stability of the RIBI when applied to children and adolescents with Fragile-X and Prader-Willi syndromes. To accomplish these aims, a multisite study will be conducted using recommended instrument development methodologies, such as focus groups, expert panels, and online surveys (n=1500). This team is in an ideal position to develop the RIBI because of our prior experience with measure development, and the conduct of clinical trials targeting repetitive inflexible behavior. The expected deliverable i an outcome measure that is appropriate for IDD populations and minimally burdensome to complete in order to be useful for multisite clinical trials."
"9407223","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) is a prevalent disorder with a number of adverse cardiovascular and neurocognitive consequences. However, the leading treatment, positive airway pressure (PAP), is poorly toler- ated by many individuals and thus the development new treatment strategies are critically needed.  A number of studies indicate that OSA is caused by the interplay of several phenotypic traits, including a small airway, an oversensitive ventilatory control system, decreased pharyngeal muscle activity during sleep, and premature arousals to a respiratory stimulus. In the previous grant leading up to this continuing renewal, we created methods for measuring these traits as well as a model (termed the ?phenotype model?) that illus- trates the relative contribution of each of these traits to a particular patient's OSA. We believe this model could be valuable for predicting response to PAP-alternatives.  At this time, PAP alternatives (oral appliances, surgery, and other devices such as hypoglossal nerve stimulation, etc.) suffer from inconsistent results, and there is no pharmacological treatment for OSA. Howev- er, respiratory control and arousal factors, which are now recognized as having pathogenic roles, provide po- tential new (and untested) pharmacological targets. The objective of this grant is to validate the predictive power of OSA phenotyping, as well as to test the effectiveness of novel pharmacological treatments alone and in combination with existing PAP alternatives such as oral appliance therapy.  In Aim 1 of this grant, patients will be ?phenotyped? using the methods developed in the previous grant. We will then perform experiments on the model, e.g., we will treat the model with drugs that change ventilatory control sensitivity and arousal threshold. These simulated treatments will generate a prediction of success or failure. We will then administer the treatments to the patient to see if the model prediction was correct. The treatments that will be given are acetazolamide (for decreasing ventilatory control sensitivity) and eszopiclone (for raising the arousal threshold). These medications will be given simultaneously as well as individually. Thus, an innovative component of this grant is that we will combine medications to maximize efficacy. Aim 2 will test the phenotype model's ability to predict response to oral appliance therapy. The same procedure of phenotyping, followed by simulated treatment on the model to generate a treatment prediction, followed by ex- perimental administration of the treatment to see if the prediction was correct will be used. Predictors of re- sponse to oral appliance therapy remain poor, so Aim 2 fills an important gap in this common alternative treat- ment. Finally, Aim 3 will test the phenotype model's ability to predict response to ?triple therapy? (acetazola- mide + eszopiclone + an oral appliance), which our preliminary data suggest can have a powerful effect on ap- nea severity in the right ?phenotype?. This research could lead to exciting new management strategies for OSA."
"9398162","Project Summary The work outlined in this application stems from our recent discovery that dihydropyridine-sensitive, voltage- gated CaV1.2 and CaV1.3 channels form clusters that undergo dynamic allosteric interactions, which allow cooperative gating of these channels in cardiac myocytes. The significance of these findings is underscored by our demonstration that coupled activation of these channels modulates pace-making activity in sinoatrial node (SAN) cells (CaV1.2 and CaV1.3) and contraction in ventricular myocytes (CaV1.2) under physiological and pathological conditions. The experiments proposed in this application test a novel model for the regulation of CaV1.2 and CaV1.3 channel activity in SAN and ventricular myocytes. In this model, CaV1.2 and CaV1.3 channels undergo reciprocal physical and functional interactions that are initiated by increases in intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i). During the action potential, channel-to-channel coupling is initiated when membrane depolarization opens CaV1.2 and CaV1.3 channels, allowing a small amount of Ca2+ to enter the cell. The incoming Ca2+ binds to calmodulin (CaM), thereby promoting physical coupling of adjacent channels via the pre-IQ domains located in the C-tails of the channels. Physical contact increases the activity of adjoined channels. As individual channels within a cluster inactivate and close, [Ca2+]i decreases and coupling fades, but persists longer than the current that evoked it, serving as a type of `molecular memory'. A new concept in our model is that the overall activity of CaV1.2 and CaV1.3 channels within a cluster depends on the number of channels that couple and the duration of these interactions. The project will test the physiological and pathological implications of this model in three specific aims. Specific aim 1 tests the hypothesis that coupling between CaV1.2 and CaV1.3 channels in SAN cells regulates pace-making activity. Specific aim 2 tests the hypothesis that persistent CaV1.2 channel coupling in ventricular myocytes induces long-term potentiation of Ca2+ currents and increases contractility. Specific aim 3 tests the hypothesis that long-QT syndrome CaM mutants increase the probability of arrhythmogenesis by altering functional coupling between CaV1.2 channels. Diverse, state-of-the-art methods, including patch-clamp electrophysiology, optical clamping, optogenetics and confocal, TIRF, and super-resolution microscopy, will be used to achieve these aims."
"9389534","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is a new application for a pre- and postdoctoral training program, the title and theme of which is Understanding Cardiovascular Disease Mechanisms. While this is a new T32 application, the cardiovascular training program at the University of Cincinnati and Children's Hospital has a renowned legacy due to 35 years of previous NIH T32 support under Dr. Arnold Schwartz (recently not renewed). The new leadership proposed here, together with a more focused and highly funded faculty wish to carry on this proud tradition of excellence in cardiovascular research and mentorship for another 35 years in Cincinnati. Our collective 19 faculty has placed 297 of their past trainees into academics over their careers, 154 of whom have run, or currently run independent research programs. The overall scientific emphasis of our training program will continue to build from a basic platform of cardiovascular physiology, cell biology, biochemistry and pharmacology, but will also incorporate the latest approaches in the post genomic era, as well as incorporating clinical and translational approaches. The cardiovascular environment at Cincinnati Children's and the University of Cincinnati is considered one of the very best in the country, with 19 NIH funded faculty (some 49 NIH grants amongst them as PI status), 166 collaborative papers published in 10 years, and the very latest technologies and approaches with outstanding core support. The leadership consists of the co-PIs Drs. Evangelia Kranias and Jeffery D. Molkentin, both of whom have a long standing track record of working closely together (15 years), as well as having excellent mentorship credentials. The Executive Committee (2 members), Internal Advisory Committee (4 members) and External Advisory Committee (3 members) are highly engaged cardiovascular researchers who will help ensure the quality of the training program.  The current proposal requests funding for 3 pre- and 3 postdoctoral trainees. Predocs are selected by the Internal Advisory Committee from a wide pool arising from departmental graduate programs, while postdoctoral candidates are selected based on being accepted into a mentor's laboratory and then passing the screening process by the Internal Advisory Committee and co-PIs. The mentoring program and evaluation process for the program are highly structured and oversight occurs on many levels. Trainees and mentors are evaluated every 6 months. The proposed educational training curriculum is highly structured and state-of-the-art. Recruitment of minorities has also been successful in the past with our faculty, and it will remain a top priority."
"9402114","Project Abstract While studies of gap junctions often cite their fundamental importance to normal electrical activation of the heart, there is little agreement on the degree of gap junction remodeling required to slow electrical activation. Our prior work has made the following seminal observations. First, the degree of cardiac hydration can modulate whether gap junction uncoupling will be associated with measurable conduction slowing and increased arrhythmia risk. Second, the microdomain adjacent to gap junction plaques is rich in the cardiac sodium channel isoform Nav1.5, is nominally 150 nm long and 10-20 nm wide. Through the use of super- resolution microscopy, electron microscopy, optical mapping, and cutting edge computations simulations, we provided evidence that the perinexus is a strong candidate structure as the cardiac ephapse. Third, we demonstrate that the buffer used to perform ex vivo whole-heart studies can modulate both perinexal width and the relationship between cardiac conduction and gap junctions. In short, altering extracellular sodium and potassium can compensate for a 50% loss of connexin43 such that conduction appears normal. These findings are entirely consistent with the various groups that have analyzed the relationship between conduction velocity and gap junctions, so much so that it is possible by post-hoc literature analysis to determine whether a group will find conduction slowing secondary to loss of Cx43 simply by the buffer used. This work is not just important for understanding alternative modes of electrical communication, but it points out an even more sobering issue: the foundational tool of ex vivo and in vitro biology (buffers) may yield investigator dependent results simply based on ionic buffer composition. In this application we will test three new aims. 1. We will test unique computational predictions of gap junctional and ephaptic coupling to demonstrate that the conduction reserve hypothesis is unique to continuous ?cable-like? propagation, and ephaptic coupling can self-attenuate conduction when intercellular widths are very narrow. 2. We will demonstrate how changing interfibrillar and perinexal separation separately alters cardiac conduction. These findings will be compared to models of ephaptic coupling in order to further support the hypothesis that ephaptic coupling is an alternative form of electrical coupling between myocytes. 3. We provide evidence that altering perfusate ion concentration can rescue conduction to the same degree as gap junction based therapy during acidosis. In this final aim, we will determine how perfusate composition modulates electrical coupling during no-flow ischemia and complete coronary artery ligation. Also, we will test whether perfusate composition can agonize the effects of gap junction therapy during ischemia."

"9404959","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Bystander training programs have recently proliferated on college campuses as a means to reduce sexual assault. While bystander training programs show promise in reducing sexual assault and have the potential to engage men as allies in this task (Coker et al., 2014), evaluations of these programs have relied largely on self report methods to measure primary outcomes (i.e., bystander efforts to intervene). Additional research is needed to understand situational factors that influence the likelihood of a bystander taking action. The present project addresses these needs by investigating the unique and interactive effects of an online bystander training program and alcohol intoxication on men's actual bystander behaviors observed in a laboratory setting. Based on prior theoretical and empirical evidence it is expected that participation in an online bystander training program will result in increased bystander behaviors to reduce sexual aggression during a laboratory analogue. Further, theories of alcohol's myopic effects on cognitive and attentional processes suggest that drinking may play a critical role in bystander behaviors (Steele & Josephs, 1990). It is expected that bystander alcohol intoxication will result in fewer and poorer quality bystander behaviors and that alcohol intoxication will moderate associations between the online bystander intervention and bystander behaviors such that the effects of the intervention will be weakened by alcohol intoxication. Knowledge gained from this study will enhance the development of programs aimed at engaging men as active bystanders to reduce sexual assault by shedding light on the interactive effects of participation in a bystander training program and acute alcohol intoxication on actual bystander behaviors."
"9593383","FUNCTIONAL INTERROGATION OF RIBOSOMAL BIOLOGY USING CONTINUOUS EVOLUTION PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT:  In nature, fundamental biological phenomena that are central to cellular life are inherently hindered from probing and interrogation, as these dynamic systems cannot be easily decoupled from immediate artifactual disruptions throughout the living cell. One such case is the ribosome, a colossal multi-component protein factory that functions as the nexus for cellular information and signaling events, integrating nutrient availability with growth dynamics and resource allocation. Despite decades of research, this biomolecular assembly remains superficially understood and underexplored, owing to the difficulty associated with decoupling the translational apparatus from cellular viability. In fact, there is currently no generalizable experimental tool-kit for unbiased high-throughput interrogation of the structure-activity and functional relationships of the ribosome, the prediction of ribosome-small molecule interactions, or the identification of disruptive resistance mechanisms. The work proposed herein seeks to overcome the challenges associated with ribosomal manipulation in vivo, to illuminate the relationship between the rRNA and the effective translation initiation/elongation rates as they relate to growth fitness, and to provide an innovative framework for the interrogation of ribosome-small molecule interactions. The proposed work focuses on the development of a fully orthogonal ribosomal system for the real-time monitoring of ribosome activity in living cells through engineered transcription-translation networks based on independently tunable genetic components at all stages. The designed orthogonal sensor ribosomes will be subjected to directed evolution yielding novel variants with enhanced or diminished kinetic properties. To achieve this, the orthogonal ribosome circuit will be interfaced with an emergent technique based on a continuous culturing methodology called Phage-Assisted Continuous Evolution (PACE), facilitating hundreds of rounds of directed evolution in just a few days with minimal researcher intervention. Finally, to demonstrate the utility of the newly developed ribosomal sensors and the evolutionary platform, this technology will be leveraged to inform antibiotic-ribosome interactions, and to generate actionable drug resistance profiles for delaying or evading microbial resistance. This platform will be extended to high-throughput screening campaigns for novel chemical scaffolds capable of modulating ribosomal translation through potentially undiscovered modes of action. Broadly, our ability to harness bacteria for biomedical and biomaterial applications in the future will hinge on the detailed understanding of the mechanistic control and optimization of ribosomal output parameters enabled by these studies. The technological advances proposed herein have the potential to extend our understanding of key factors governing ribosomal function and dynamics, and will pave the way towards the development of novel mechanisms that will illuminate and enhance new approaches in biomedical research and targeted antimicrobial therapeutics."
"9397562","PROJECT SUMMARY A major mechanism proposed for HDL's beneficial effect on cardiovascular disease risk is its capacity to promote cholesterol excretion through a process called reverse cholesterol transport (RCT). Elevated HDL cholesterol levels are generally correlated with reduced disease risk. However, recent trials of HDL-raising drugs failed to observe a clinical benefit. This has led to a revised HDL hypothesis where the functional capacity of HDL to promote peripheral cholesterol efflux and RCT, not HDL concentration, is deemed most important for its protective role. Cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) facilitates the net movement of cholesteryl ester (CE) between plasma lipoproteins. In humans, following the conversion of tissue-derived cholesterol to CE on HDL, 70% of HDL CE is transferred by CETP to VLDL and LDL prior to being removal by the liver. Thus, CETP is a central player in the HDL-mediated cholesterol excretion pathway. We have shown in vitro that apolipoprotein F (ApoF) modulates CETP activity by inhibiting lipid transfers involving LDL but stimulating lipid transfer between HDL and VLDL. We hypothesize that ApoF operates as a metabolic switch by redirecting HDL-derived CE to VLDL instead of LDL, and that this reduces plasma LDL cholesterol levels and stimulates RCT. Here, we test this hypothesis and investigate mechanisms controlling ApoF activity. Aim 1 ? Determine the role of ApoF in defining the fate of HDL-derived CE ? With an established model of siRNA-mediated ApoF knockdown in hamsters, we will quantify how the loss of this key protein modifies the efflux of HDL CE to LDL and VLDL, measure the hepatic clearance of VLDL and LDL CE, and determine the impact of ApoF on HDL function and RCT in chow-fed and fat-fed animals. Aim 2 ? Define the mechanism that converts ApoF to its active form and quantify the effect of hyperlipidemia on ApoF concentration and its activation status ? Plasma ApoF exists in both active and inactive forms; active ApoF is bound to LDL. Hypercholesterolemic LDL is enriched in ApoF. We hypothesize that the molecular packing of LDL surface lipids controls ApoF binding. We will identify the molecular properties of LDL that correlate with enhanced ApoF binding and rigorously test their role in this process. Total and active ApoF concentrations will be quantified in hyperlipidemic human subjects to determine their possible contribution to aberrant lipoprotein levels. Aim 3 ? Determine the factors that control plasma ApoF levels ? In fat-fed animals, plasma ApoF is increased but hepatic APOF mRNA levels are decreased. To understand these discordant observa- tions, the molecular mechanisms causing this decrease in APOF mRNA will be determined, and the turnover of plasma ApoF in normolipidemic and hypercholesterolemic hamsters will be compared. We anticipate find- ing that greater association of ApoF with LDL lengthens its plasma residence time. Overall, these studies will provide novel insight into how ApoF regulates CETP activity and enhances the functional properties of HDL."
"9397570","Clinical and Metabolic Signature of Recovered Myocardium in Human Heart Failure Summary:  Remarkable improvements in myocardial structure and function have been reported in some advanced heart failure (HF) patients undergoing ?mechanical unloading? induced by left ventricular assist devices (LVAD). Unlike other HF therapies, which have also been associated with significant myocardial improvement, this tractable and specific LVAD population provides us access to pre-treatment myocardial tissue from both responders and non- responders which has enabled us to start probing the ?signature? of myocardium that has the potential to improve. Our central hypothesis is that refining this ?signature? will lead to a rational therapeutic approach in severe HF and will reveal broader recovery principles applicable to all stages and severity of HF.  Achieving and defining ?response? in LVAD patients requires a battery of diagnostic and therapeutic protocols and, as shown in the real world of advanced HF multicenter registries, this is challenging. Thus, there is a critical need for a selection process that can reliably predict who will and who will not ?respond? to LVAD therapy. This program will also enable us to develop such a predictive model in addition to our studies of the mechanisms driving myocardial recovery. First we will provide a clinically relevant ?signature? of failing hearts with the potential for recovery. Following a derivation- validation approach we will develop a myocardial recovery score using myocardial structural and/ or functional parameters together with clinical characteristics. This score will create a precise algorithm for selection of patients likely to recover prior to LVAD intervention, enrich the criteria for device explantation and sustained recovery following LVAD intervention and likely increase the real world incidence and sustainability of LVAD enabled recovery. Second, we hypothesized that specific metabolic adaptations drive myocardial recovery. Our preliminary data after examining myocardial tissue from normal donors and LVAD patients suggests a post- LVAD mismatch in glycolytic versus mitochondrial intermediates that might indicate increased flux through the cardioprotective pentose phosphate pathway. We have developed methodology and will employ novel and powerful in vivo metabolic flux studies using stable isotopes, mitochondrial respiratory measurements and additional metabolic assays to test this hypothesis.  This project offers a rare opportunity to closely integrate clinical function, structure and in vivo mechanistic studies in human HF and recovery. The physiological insights derived are providing clinical characteristics and biomarkers that will impact our practice in advanced HF patients. They are also revealing novel biological insights that inform both our clinical and basic science understanding of myocardial recovery applicable to all stages and severity of HF."
"9539480","Project Summary A big concern has recently arisen regarding the safety of anesthesia in infants and children based on the profoundly increasing preclinical evidences in rodents and nonhuman primates that the commonly used anesthetics in clinic are neurotoxic to the developing brain and may cause long-term neurobehavioral abnormalities. Hence, the clinical relevance of anesthetic neurotoxicity as well as the development of biomarkers for early detection of anesthetic-induced neuronal injury is an urgent matter of public health. Since the diversified neuronal lipids play specific roles in the nervous system, small disturbance in the brain could result in changes of lipids in the brain, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and plasma. General anesthetics, due to their lipid solubility, readily enter the brain, dissolve into cellular membranes, penetrate organelle, disturb dynamics of neuronal lipidome, and leave far-reaching effects on the developing nervous system (neurotoxicity). We hypothesized that perturbation of brain lipids with anesthetics is manifest in brain tissues, CSF, and/or plasma of patients at a very early stage of anesthetic-induced brain injury, and these changed lipids can serve as biomarker(s) for early detection of anesthetic neurotoxicity. We believe the changes of lipids induced with anesthetic exposure can be detected at a very early stage of brain injury by our enabling technology, shotgun lipidomics, which we have recently pioneered with the support of NIH funding. The power of this technology has been demonstrated in discovery of altered lipids in CSF and plasma in accompanying the changes in brain tissues of Alzheimer's disease. In the application, we will take the advantages of an existing research project in which our collaborators at the FDA are conducting studies on the anesthetic- induced neuronal injury in the developing monkey model, which has proved to be invaluable for informing aspects of human pharmacology, physiology, toxicology, etc. Our hypothesis is strongly supported by the preliminary studies showing that numerous lipid classes were significantly changed in brain, CSF, and plasma of monkeys exposed to anesthetics. To further test our hypothesis, we will (1) identify that the changes of lipid content in monkey brain tissues occur at a much earlier stage (i.e., shorter duration) of anesthetic exposure in comparison to that revealed from the enhanced neuronal cell death and/or changes in gene expression; (2) determine that altered lipids in both CSF and plasma of monkeys which are exposed to anesthetic(s) occurs at the stage parallel to that detected with the changes of lipid content and/or composition in brain tissues; and (3) verify that the altered lipids manifest in CSF and plasma of monkeys exposed to anesthetic(s) can be served as biomarkers for early detection of anesthetic-induced neurotoxicity. The proposed studies hold tremendous promise for the discovery of a panel of specific and sensitive lipid biomarkers for detection of anesthetic neurotoxicity at its early stage in CSF and/or plasma, which can be used for future translational studies. This study might also provide insight into the biochemical mechanism underlying general anesthetic neurotoxicity."
"9394819","PROJECT SUMMARY Increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) have been considered to be the main pathogenic factors in the development and progression of vascular dysfunction in diabetes. However, the mechanisms of ROS-induced microvascular complications and the interplay of ROS with nitric oxide (NO) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS) under diabetic conditions remain poorly understood. Currently, ROS-induced endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) uncoupling and NO deficiency-mediated vascular dysfunction have been extensively studied in cultured endothelial cells and arterioles. Very little is known about the direct effect of ROS on eNOS activity and permeability in venules, a crucial site for solute and fluid exchange and a major site of inflammation. Our preliminary studies conducted in intact rat venules revealed the roles of H2O2 in eNOS activation, NO production, peroxynitrite formation, and cellular and molecular mechanisms of H2O2-mediated permeability increases. Our findings that diabetic rats have increased plasma H2O2 and decreased catalase activity suggest that the mechanisms of H2O2-mediated changes in microvascular permeability may resemble those involved in ROS-mediated microvessel complication in diabetes. We hypothesize that ROS do not reduce NO production, but rather cause excessive NO production and peroxynitrite formation in venules. The NO-derived peroxynitrite further activates eNOS, resulting in augmented peroxynitrite formation. This self-promoting mechanism is the key for H2O2-induced peroxynitrite-mediated cell injury, Ca2+ overload in endothelial cells, and microvascular barrier dysfunction. The hypothesis will be tested in three specific aims: 1) investigate the cellular mechanisms of H2O2-induced NO production and NO-mediated microvascular barrier dysfunction; 2) investigate the role of NO-derived peroxynitrite in H2O2-induced microvascular barrier dysfunction; and 3) investigate the cellular and molecular mechanisms of ROS-mediated microvascular dysfunction in diabetes. The designed experiments with combined quantitative measurements of microvessel permeability along with confocal and electron microscopic investigation in individually perfused microvessels enable ROS-mediated changes in signaling molecules, enzyme activities, and vascular structures to be directly linked with changes in vascular barrier function. The addition of newly developed Nrf2 knockout rats that genetically modify antioxidant defenses into the proposal will benefit the mechanistic investigations of ROS-mediated microvascular complications in diabetes. The results derived from this proposal will provide new information that bridges studies using whole animals, organs, or vascular beds with studies using cultured endothelial cells and provide a better understanding of the pathogenesis of diabetes-associated microvascular complication and benefit the development of targeted therapeutics."
"9386762","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recent epidemiologic studies have demonstrated increased morbidity, mortality, and the development of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) associated with red blood cell (RBC) transfusions in the critically ill, yet the mechanisms underlying this association remain unknown. Our data demonstrate that banked RBCs induce necroptosis (a form of regulated necrotic cell death) of lung endothelial cells and enhance susceptibility to subsequent injury. We have previously demonstrated that the proinflammatory receptor for advanced glycation endproducts (RAGE) mediates lung endothelial dysfunction following RBC transfusion. The overall goal of this proposal is to elucidate the role of RAGE in RBC-induced necroptosis. In Specific Aim 1 the role of RAGE in sensing necroptotic stimuli will be examined in vitro and in a micro-engineered model of human lung. Specific Aim 2 will explore the role of intracellular RAGE in necroptosis execution. Lastly, Specific Aim 3 will examine the in vivo effects of RBC- induced necroptosis on lung injury using animal models. Knowledge derived from these studies will elucidate some of the mechanisms by which RBCs enhance susceptibility to lung injury and hopefully lead to novel therapies to prevent the morbidity associated with RBC transfusions."
"9387401","Project Summary/Abstract  The aims of the USC Norris Cancer Control Research Program are to elucidate the etiology of cancer risk  behaviors in the general population and develop primary prevention interventions that modify cancer risk  behavior and enhance secondary prevention, clinical care, and survivorship. These aims serve the overarching  goal of reducing and eliminating cancer health disparities among the populations represented in the USC  Norris catchment area, with implications for other populations globally. The Program's goals align with the USC  Norris strategic plan by: a) developing and testing new interventions that impact the cancer burden; b) applying  cutting-edge technology and methodology to assess exposures and disseminate interventions; and c)  spanning the continuum of care from primary prevention to survivorship. A hallmark of this Program has been  the application of innovative theory and methodology to develop integrated lines of research on cancer risk  behaviors and preventive interventions. Given that the diverse, vulnerable, and disadvantaged members of the  catchment area reached by the Program's work also reflect the disparities seen at the US population level and  the Program makes significant strides in addressing the mission of NCI's efforts in cancer control and  population sciences. Recent achievements of the Program, which is led by two internationally-recognized  experts, Mary Ann Pentz (primary prevention) and Anna Wu (secondary prevention and survivorship), include  1) understanding mental health comorbidities with tobacco use to inform more tailored smoking cessation  programs for vulnerable smokers who have been unable to quit by other means; 2) promoting cultural values  and decreasing perceived cultural discrimination as means to improve tobacco prevention and control efforts  with Hispanic youth and adults; and 3) utilizing executive function and mindfulness skills training in primary  prevention programs that target diet, physical inactivity, and other cancer risk behaviors in youth and applying  such interventions to cancer patients, caregivers, and families to improve treatment outcomes. The 30  members represent five schools and 13 departments at USC, and have $15M in peer-reviewed funding (direct  costs), 33% of which is from NCI, 27% from other NIH sources, and 33% from other peer-reviewed funding  sources. The Program is highly productive with 756 publications of which 17% are inter-programmatic, 23%  intra-programmatic and 53% inter-institutional."
"9242267","According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), alcohol use disorder (AUD) continues to be the third leading cause of death in the U.S. Multiple studies from the Collaborative Studies on Genetics of Alcoholism (COGA) and Study of Addiction: Genes and Environment (SAGE) confirm that being an individual with a family history positive (FHP) for alcoholism is a key, predictable determinant for the development and expression of AUD. The selectively bred alcohol-preferring P rat and, to a lesser extent, the high-alcohol- drinking HAD rat lines meet criteria put forth for a valid animal model of alcoholism and display certain genetic-, behavioral-, and physiological-related phenotypes observed in FHP individuals. This core is a Research Resource for the Integrative Neuroscience Initiative on Alcoholism (INIA-Neuroimmune [INIA-N]) consortium. The Specific Aims of this Research Resource will test the effects of (1) treatment with target small molecules on excessive ethanol (EtOH) drinking by P and HAD rats, (2) infusions of shRNA and/or cDNA (to downregulate or upregulate, respectively, target gene expression levels) into subregions of the extended amygdala (Ext-Amyg) and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) on excessive EtOH drinking by P and HAD rats, and (3) work closely with Dayne Mayfield?s, and others U01s, in identifying neuroimmune signaling, and/or their pathway, targets associated with a genetic predisposition to develop AUD. For this, we will use our previous and ongoing genomic and proteomic work for excessive alcohol drinking. Some of the targets observed so far match those of INIA-N as a whole including toll-like receptors [TLRs], interleukin receptors [ILRs], phosphodiesterase 4 [PDE4], and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor [PPAR]. This core will work closely with U01 components and the U24 ?Electrophysiology Core? to address pertinent research questions raised by respective U01s and/or the Administrative Core. This is a significant core that will provide important verification and heuristic information on neuroimmune signaling in AUD in general, as well as in genetically predisposed subjects in particular. Moreover, this Core will evaluate compounds suggested by Mayfield?s LINCS analysis and manipulators of immune targets revealed in ongoing work of INIA-N. This is a highly innovative project that uses state-of-the-art techniques to selectively alter the expression of ?target? genes within discrete CNS subregions in multigenerational, genetically selected (P, HAD1 and HAD2) FHP rats. This U24 core provides synergy with a number of INIA-N investigators, including Blednov, Crabbe, Hitzemann, Kieffer, Lasek, Mason, Mayfield, Morrisett, Pfefferbaum, and Roberto, as well as Becker/Lopez of INIA-Stress."
"9386765","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Diabetes remains a major risk factor for the development of both ischemic and non-ischemic cardiovascular disease (CVD); however, despite improvements in clinical treatments, our knowledge of the molecular underpinnings of diabetes-associated CVD is poorly understood. As with the majority of cardiovascular physiology, pathologic cardiovascular events exhibit a time-of-day-dependence, with regards to both onset and impact on disease progression and we have shown that the cardiomyocyte circadian clock directly influences the manner with which the heart responds to specific stressors. Importantly, we have shown that diabetes induces a phase shift in the cardiomyocyte circadian clock. Thus dysynchrony of the cardiomyocyte circadian clock may be an important and previously unrecognized contributor to the etiology of diabetic cardiomyopathy. Protein O-GlcNAcylation, a metabolically regulated post-translational modification that rapidly influences protein function, is increasingly recognized as a key regulator of both cardiac physiology and pathology including the adverse effects of diabetes. We recently reported that the cardiomyocyte circadian clock directly influences cardiac O-GlcNAc levels, that at least two circadian clock components are O-GlcNAc modified, and those acute increases in O-GlcNAc levels phase shifts the clock similarly to that seen in the heart during diabetes. We have also observed increased protein synthesis in the heart during the inactive phase, a time when protein O-GlcNAcylation is low. This has led us to postulate that protein O- GlcNAcylation may be a key mechanism by which the cardiomyocyte circadian clock temporally coordinates repair/replacement of damaged proteins in the heart. Collectively, these observations support the overall hypothesis of this proposal that dysregulation of protein O-GlcNAcylation is a critical factor contributing to diabetes-induced alterations of the cardiomyocyte circadian clock, and that misalignment of the cardiomyocyte circadian clock represents a key mechanism underlying diabetes-related cardiac dysfunction. To test this hypothesis we will pursue 3 specific aims: 1) Determine the molecular underpinnings linking the cardiomyocyte circadian clock with protein O-GlcNAcylation, and identify how this relationship is altered during diabetes; 2) Determine the role of O-GlcNAcylation in circadian clock mediated protein turnover, and elucidate how this relationship is modified during diabetes; 3) Determine whether re-alignment of the cardiomyocyte circadian clock during diabetes attenuates cardiomyopathy development. Successful completion of the proposed studies will lead to new fundamental insights regarding the molecular mechanisms underlying the role of aberrant circadian function in the development of diabetes-related cardiac disease and will help identify new approaches for reducing the risk of CVD in diabetic patients."
"9397575","Myocardial infarction (MI) is a common injury that causes permanent loss of hundreds of millions of cardiac muscle cells, increasing susceptibility to heart failure and sudden death. Major goals of regenerative medicine are methodologies to enhance cardiomyocyte recovery after MI and to restore cardiac function to heart failure patients. Heart regeneration is limited in adult mammals, but occurs naturally in adult zebrafish and neonatal mice through the activation of cardiomyocyte division. Whereas the research community has identified several factors important for heart regeneration over the past decade, we still know little of the regulatory mechanisms needed to activate regeneration programs in injured cardiac tissue. In particular, questions of whether regulatory enhancer elements are employed, and how specific they are to regeneration, are virtually unexplored. This is a critical deficiency, as the identification and manipulation of such elements could both expand our understanding of regeneration and have applications in regenerative medicine. In a recent collaboration between our groups, we found evidence for tissue regeneration enhancer elements (TREEs) that trigger gene expression in injury sites and can be engineered to modulate the regenerative potential of vertebrate organs including the heart. Here, we propose a multi-PI project exploiting the strengths of the zebrafish and mouse model systems to delineate regulatory sequences that control regeneration programs, and to create TREE-based factor delivery constructs to optimize heart regeneration in higher and lower vertebrates. 1) We will define the cis-regulatory motifs and binding factors necessary for activity of a TREE that is linked to the zebrafish leptin b gene. 2) We will use this TREE to define effects of enhancer-delivered pro-regenerative factors after cardiac injury in zebrafish and mice, focusing initially on provision of mitogenic and angiogenic molecules. 3) We will use open chromatin profiling approaches to identify new TREEs that activate expression in endothelial and/or endocardial cell types during zebrafish heart regeneration. We will perform sequence comparisons in mice, and we will initiate a program to generate transgenic reporter and TREE deletion animals to test the sufficiency and requirements for these sequences in directing regeneration programs. With these approaches, we will test the hypothesis that cardiac injury activates regeneration enhancer elements to facilitate heart regeneration."
"9380968","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Xenbase, the Xenopus model organism database, is a web accessible resource that integrates all the diverse genomic and biological data from Xenopus research. The goal of Xenbase is to empower Xenopus research, enhance the impact of Xenopus research data and to facilitate the dissemination of this data. Xenopus frogs are one of the major vertebrate animal models used for biomedical research. Comparative functional genomics between humans and model organisms such as Xenopus have led to a wealth of discoveries and in this post genomic era and with thousands of scientific publications annually and the exponential growth of large-scale datasets, resources such as Xenbase are essential to translate this vast body of data into a meaningful biological synthesis. Xenbase is the only central repository for the enormous amount of data generated from Xenopus research. Our relational database and user-friendly interface make this data easy to query, and allows investigators to quickly interrogate and link different data types in ways that would otherwise be difficult, time consuming, or impossible. Xenbase also enhances the value of Xenopus data through high quality curation, data integration, providing bioinformatics tools optimized for Xenopus experiments, and by linking Xenopus data to humans and other model organisms. Xenbase plays an indispensable role in making Xenopus data accessible to the broader biomedical community by continually providing annotated data updates to organizations such as NCBI, UniProtKB and Ensemble. Xenbase accelerates discovery, enabling investigators to make novel connections between molecular pathway in Xenopus and human disease. Xenbase plays an essential role in maximizing the NIH's ~$130 million annual investment in Xenopus research. The Goal of this proposal is to maintain and expand Xenbase. Our Aims, developed through extensive input from the community are: Aim1 Maintain Xenbase and continue curation of Xenopus research data Aim 2 Develop support for Xenopus models of human diseases Aim 3 Enhance support for new data types, bioinformatics tools and data sharing infrastructure"
"9448021","Abstract Glucocorticoids (GC) play a key role in metabolic adaptation during stress. However, chronic exposure to GC, is harmful and results in disorders such as insulin resistance. We previously identified angiopoietin-like 4 (Angptl4) as a GC-regulated gene encoding a secreted protein that promotes adipocyte lipolysis and inhibits extracellular lipoprotein lipase (LPL). We showed that Angptl4 is required for GC-promoted lipolysis in white adipose tissue (WAT) and in Angptl4 null mice (Angptl4-/-), excess GC-induced fatty liver and hypertriglyceridemia are diminished. Our recent preliminary studies further demonstrated that GC-induced insulin resistance was compromised in Angptl4-/- mice. Intriguingly, GC treatment increased hepatic ceramide levels, but such GC effect was attenuated in the absence of Angptl4. Indeed, myriocin, which inhibits ceramide synthesis, decreased GC-induced insulin resistance in wild type (WT) but not Angptl4-/- mice. We additionally found that GC exposure elevated the activity of PP2A and PKC? (two downstream effectors of ceramides) as well as the expression of a list of ceramide synthetic genes in liver. In Angptl4-/- mice, the activity of PP2A and PKC? was mitigated and the expression of ceramide synthase 3-6 (Cers3-6) was specifically impaired. Based on these preliminary data, we hypothesize that GC augment the expression of Angptl4, which promotes WAT lipolysis mobilizing fatty acids (FA) to liver to serve as substrates and signals required for GC to increase Cers3-6 expression. This elevates the production of specific ceramide species to activate PP2A and PKC? to suppress insulin action. In this proposal, we will examine this model. In Aim 1, our preliminary study found that the fibrinogen-like domain (FLD) of Angptl4 promotes adipocyte lipolysis without inhibiting LPL. We will test whether FLD restores GC-induced insulin resistance in Angptl4-/- mice. We will also examine the role of FA mobilization to the liver in GC-induced insulin resistance using mice with reduced expression of two major hepatic FA transporters, Fatp5 and Cd36. Moreover, hyperinsulinemic- euglycemic clamps will be used to determine the role of Angptl4 in GC-augmented hepatic glucose production, a hallmark of hepatic insulin resistance. In Aim 2, we will determine which ceramide synthase(s), Cers3-6, are involved in GC-induced insulin resistance. PPAR? can be activated by FA and has been shown to increase ceramide synthesis in certain tissues. Thus, its role in GC-induced hepatic Cers3-6 expression and ceramide production will be examined. In Aim 3, we will analyze the role of PP2A and PKC? in GC- induced insulin resistance and will identify ceramide synthase(s) that activate PP2A and PKC? to cause insulin resistance. Overall, this study will be the first to establish the FLD of Angptl4 as a lipid mobilization factor participating in GC-induced insulin resistance and for the first time, specific ceramide synthases that activate PKC? and PP2A will be identified. These findings will advance our understanding of the mechanism of insulin resistance and will provide novel molecular targets for improving insulin sensitivity. ! !"
"9473405","Neurodegenerative diseases of human aging are significant US health burdens due to the growing number of people living with dementia. Many disorders like Alzheimer's disease are associated with excess brain iron that accumulates with age. Such observations have led to the metal theory of dementia, which suggests that over time, environmental exposure to iron promotes neurodegeneration. We have discovered that ?9-THC and other cannabinoids inhibit the iron transporter divalent metal transporter-1 (DMT1) through cannabinoid receptor-2 (CB2). CB2 is an immunomodulatory receptor and its anti-inflammatory neuroprotective effects confer suppression of microglia activation. Microglial cells act as the immune cells of the brain and spinal cord, becoming activated by changes in their local microenvironment. Microglia polarize between reactive and repair states to actively transition from an immune-stimulating antimicrobial phenotype to one that supports tissue repair and resolution of inflammation. SPECIFIC AIM 1: Determine mechanisms of microglial iron transport and metabolism. We have determined that IMG cell iron uptake corresponds to the M1/M2 activation state of IMG cells. While more non-transferrin (Tf) bound iron (NTBI) is taken up by LPS-treated cells, Tf-mediated transport is increased by IL-4. Based on our data, we hypothesize that microglial cell polarization directs iron trafficking. We will: a) Test the hypothesis that microglial cell polarization controls uptake and metabolic partitioning of iron into subcellular compartments; and b) Test the hypothesis that IMG cell activation by A? alters microglia metabolism by up- regulating DMT1 activity and dysregulating energy metabolism. SPECIFIC AIM 2: Determine influence of CB2 on microglial iron transport and metabolism. We have determined the CB2 selective agonist JWH102 reduces the pro-inflammatory activation state of IMG cells promoted by A?. We have also found that CB2 promotes dephosphorylation of DMT1 to block its activation. Based on our data, we hypothesize that CB2 redirects iron trafficking and cellular metabolism by regulating DMT1 phosphorylation. We will: a) Test the hypothesis that the CB2 selective agonist JWH102 reduces NTBI iron transport and shifts energy metabolism in LPS and A?-activated IMG cells; and b) Test the hypothesis that CB2 regulates DMT1 phosphorylation to control is activity in IMG cells."
"9395933","Background: People living with HIV/AIDS smoke at nearly three times the rate of the general population. In our view, shared by others in the field, the single greatest health behavior change that could improve cardiovascular morbidity and associated mortality is to assist people living with HIV/AIDS who smoke to quit. Although many interventions are effective in helping general population smokers quit, research examining outcomes of smoking cessation treatments for individuals with HIV is limited. Thus establishing the efficacy of interventions for smoking cessation for individuals with HIV is of critical importance and is directly responsive to the RFA which specifically requests proposals to test strategies to optimize smoking cessation in HIV populations.? Approach: Our proposed study will use a factorial design to evaluate the most promising behavioral and pharmacologic treatments aimed at achieving maximal efficacy for smoking cessation among people living with HIV/AIDS who smoke. Specifically, we propose to randomize 300 participants to one of the following 4 conditions: (1) varenicline + Positively Smoke Free (an 8 session smoking cessation intervention tailored for PLWH); (2) varenicline + Standard of Care (brief advice to quit); (3) Placebo + Positively Smoke Free; and (4) Placebo + Standard of Care. Given the factorial nature of the design, we will be able to assess the main effect of varenicline vs. Placebo, Positively Smoke Free vs. Standard of Care, and the interaction of those two treatments (i.e., does the addition of varenicline significantly increase the effect of Positively Smoke Free?). We chose to use a factorial design as it is a highly efficient method of assessing multiple treatments in a single trial with the possibility of saving both time and resources. All participants will be assessed at baseline, 12 weeks and 24 weeks with the main outcome being 7-day abstinence (defined as self-reported no smoking in the past 7 days + CO<10 ppm). We will then follow-up all participants at 6 months post study conclusion to assess continued abstinence as well as changes in cardiovascular risk. The sizeable cohort and prospective design will also permit us to evaluate the effects of tobacco use, treatment, and cessation on a panel of soluble biomarkers of inflammation that are likely contributors to cardiac morbidity and mortality in PLWH. Implications: Results of this study will provide crucial, real world evidence of the best way for healthcare providers to help smokers living with HIV/AIDS quit smoking with the ultimate goal of improving longevity by lowering risk of mortality, especially cardiac-related mortality."

"9386771","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cellular mechanisms that mediate steatohepatitis, an increasingly prevalent condition in the Western world for which no therapies are available, are poorly understood. Using human genome wide association studies, we recently identified TTC39B (T39), which encodes a tetratricopeptide repeat-domain protein of unknown function, as a novel gene influencing HDL cholesterol levels. We have sought to understand the functions of T39 and its potential significance for human diseases using mouse models. These studies have revealed that T39 deficient mice are protected from development of fatty liver, steatohepatitis and atherosclerosis. T39 appears to be a scaffolding protein that regulates the post-transcriptional degradation of LXR, a transcription factor controlling cholesterol efflux genes and well as genes promoting triglyceride synthesis. In addition to beneficial lipoprotein changes and reduced atherosclerosis, T39 deficiency protects from hepatic steatosis and steatohepatitis when mice are challenged with high fat/high cholesterol diets, and the underlying mechanisms of these novel observations will be the main focus of this proposal. We will also explore the basic functions of T39 such as its ability to facilitate ubiquitination and degradation of LXR. Aim 1 will assess the mechanisms of reduced hepatic steatosis in T39-/- mice, Aim2 will determine tissue-specific effects of T39 in liver, spleen and hematopoietic cells; Aim 3 will explore the mechanisms of the post- transcriptional increase in LXR protein in T39-/- hepatocytes. These studies have the potential to uncover new treatments for steatohepatitis and atherosclerosis."
"9389007","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Several lines of experimental evidence indicate that disruption of certain aspects of intra-cellular cholesterol homeostasis in various cell types (e.g. macrophage, ?-cell) can lead to pathological processes preceding type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and atherosclerotic vascular disease (ASCVD). Our recent transcriptomic study of purified human monocytes corroborates these findings, and specifically identifies a co-expressed cholesterol metabolism transcriptional network (CMTN) whose alteration is significantly associated with T2DM and coronary artery calcification (CAC, a subclinical ASCVD measure). This network includes 11 genes involved in coordinated up-regulation of cholesterol uptake and synthesis, and down-regulation of cholesterol efflux - a molecular profile expected to increase intracellular cholesterol. To translate these intriguing observations into meaningful improvements in human health, our goal is to comprehensively characterize the epigenetic regulators of this network of genes in human monocytes, and to investigate how this network and its regulatory factors relate to intra-cellular cholesterol in the monocytes and to the development of T2DM and ASCVD. Our principle focus will be on epigenetic regulation of this network by microRNAs (miRNAs). It is already well established via in vitro and animal models that one specific miRNA (miR-33) plays a critical role in cholesterol homeostasis in concert with its co-transcribed host gene, SREBP2. Our pilot data from 373 human monocyte samples indicate that intra-cellular levels of miR-33a is associated with expression of the entire gene network of interest in this proposal and with prevalent T2DM in the cell donors. We also identified several other promising miRNA candidates associated with expression of the gene network. Based on these preliminary data, and taking advantage of the well-phenotyped Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) cohort with existing genomic data, DNA methylomic and transcriptomic data on 1,264 monocyte samples, and miRNA sequencing data in a subset of 373 monocyte samples, we now proposes to additionally quantify miRNAs in the remaining 891 monocyte samples using next generation sequencing to achieve the following specific aims: 1) To characterize the relationship between miRNAs and the CMTN in 1,264 MESA monocyte samples; 2) To establish the association of miRNAs with T2DM and CAC in the 1,264 MESA participants; 3) To replicate miRNA associations with the most compelling evidence in an independent set of 562 MESA participants; and 4) To validate the functional consequences of the CMTN alterations and associated-miRNAs, using ex-vivo cultured human monocytes. The integration of genetic, epigenetic, transcriptional, and clinical data along with the ex-vivo experimental studies may provide novel mechanistic insights concerning the regulation of cholesterol metabolism and susceptibility to T2DM and ASCVD and lead to new strategies for prevention and treatment of T2DM and ASCVD."

"9377536","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a major public health concern in the US, and the current prevalence of TBI in the US is unprecedented. Individuals with TBI experience diverse patterns of early recovery and long- term clinical outcomes, and some TBI survivors experience accelerated cognitive and health decline as they age. Little is known about factors that predict different trajectories of outcome. The extent to which factors associated with cognitive and health decline in older adults in general (e.g., physical inactivity, medical comorbidity) applies to older adults with a history of TBI is not known. Many existing studies face methodological challenges that limit their usefulness in evaluating cognitive and health outcomes over time, such as small sample sizes, limited follow-up, use of imprecise functional measures, and application of traditional regression approaches whose assumptions are typically not met in longitudinal clinical studies. Our current knowledge of TBI outcomes is confined by these limitations. Recent methodological developments in psychometrics and statistical modeling can be applied to existing data sets, as proposed here, to significantly advance understanding of TBI outcomes and the factors that influence these outcomes over time. The proposed research and career development plan will first evaluate and account for measurement imprecision in commonly used TBI outcome measures, and then evaluate trajectories of temporal change in cognitive and health outcomes for individuals with TBI using advanced statistical methods ideally suited to this purpose.  The research and career development plan outlined in this application consists of four complementary objectives that will be implemented during the award period. Objective 1 aims to develop proficiency in the application of advanced psychometric methods to evaluate and adjust for measurement error and bias in commonly used TBI assessment tools. Objective 2 is to acquire mastery in applying sophisticated statistical methods that are capable of evaluating longitudinal relationships among factors that influence TBI outcomes over time, and relate individual clinical trajectories to postmortem neuropathological features of TBI. Objective 3 involves establishing broad fluency in related disciplines of neuropathology, neuroimaging, and genetics that are necessary for interdisciplinary TBI research. Objective 4 is to secure independent research funding.  Results from the research related to this K01 award will advance knowledge regarding potentially modifiable factors that are associated with heterogeneity in clinical outcomes over time after TBI, paving the way for appropriately timed and individually tailored interventions throughout the lifespan for TBI survivors. The knowledge gained can direct efforts to improve health and life quality for TBI survivors, and to help patients, families, and care systems plan for the future."
"9385303","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed Community Action to Promote Healthy Environments (CA-PHE) builds on, and substantially extends, over 15 years of community-based participatory research by the involved partners to understand and address issues of air pollution and health in Detroit. Specifically, CA-PHE will engage community, academic and public health practice partners in research that will culminate in the development and implementation of a public health action plan that reduces exposure to air pollutants, mitigates adverse health effects, and provides additional health and environmental benefits. CA-PHE will increase knowledge about factors influencing exposure to air pollution and health effects, translate findings into a public health action plan, and implement campaigns, interventions and policies to reduce pollutant exposure and mitigate adverse health impacts. It will improve health outcomes and quality of life in vulnerable communities disproportionately at risk for cardiovascular and respiratory disease. The proposed project has five specific aims: Specific Aim 1: Strengthen, support and enhance the capacity of the community, academic and practice partners engaged in CA-PHE to work effectively together, and to conduct, understand and communicate effectively about the science of air pollution and human health; and of the CA-PHE Steering Committee to provide oversight for, and be actively engaged in, all aspects of the proposed research to action project. Specific Aim 2: Identify pollutant sources associated with adverse health outcomes, and examine strategies to mitigate these outcomes. Strategies to be examined will include the use of vegetative buffers to reduce impacts from pollutant sources (e.g., industry, highways) to occupied areas (e.g., residences, schools), an innovative and broadly applicable approach with many co-benefits (e.g., noise reduction, thermal cooling, watershed protection, recreation). Specific Aim 3. Develop a multilevel, integrated and scientifically informed public health action plan designed to reduce pollutant exposures and to mitigate their adverse health effects. The plan will be developed collaboratively, engaging individuals with a wide range of expertise (e.g., community organizing, planning, policy, public health, business) to evaluate existing evidence and to develop recommendations for short-, mid- and long- term strategies that reduce air pollution exposure and its negative effects on health. Specific Aim 4: Develop and implement campaigns, interventions and policies designed to promote the adoption and implementation of the public health action plan to reduce exposure and adverse effects on health. Efforts will be undertaken collaboratively by community, practice and academic partners, and designed to engage community residents, planners, community and business leaders, as well as public health and other local decision makers. Specific Aim 5: Conduct process and outcome evaluation of the development of the public health action plan, assess the effectiveness and impact of campaigns, interventions and policies carried out as part of the implementation of that plan, and assess the factors that influence the success of these action strategies."
"9390934","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): With an estimated annual incidence of 300,000-350,000 and accounting for 50% of all cardiovascular deaths in the US, sudden cardiac death (SCD) is a condition with significant implications for public health. Survival among out-of-hospital cardiac arrest victims remains <5%, making SCD prediction and prevention essential. However, current SCD risk stratification methodology, largely based on identification of severe left ventricular (LV) systolic dysfunction (LV ejection fraction, LVEF <35%), is inadequate. While some novel risk markers have been identified, no effective risk stratification tool has been adopted, and prediction of SCD in individuals with preserved LVEF (LVEF ?50%) has not been addressed. The overall hypothesis of this proposal is that predictors of SCD in patients with preserved LVEF can be identified in the general population (the Oregon Sudden Unexpected Death Study, Oregon SUDS), and validated in a prospective cohort (the Framingham Heart Study, FHS); and that these predictors will contribute to the mechanistic understanding of SCD, as well as risk stratification methodology. Our specific aims are 1) to identify novel markers of SCD risk in individuals with preserved EF using echocardiographic imaging studies and detailed evaluation of coronary/myocardial abnormalities for improved risk prediction; 2) to investigate the role of right ventricular dysfunction and associated non-cardiac clinical conditions in predicting SCD risk with preserved EF; and 3) to combine genotypes and risk phenotypes, combined with clinical history, EKG parameters, and medication use to improve SCD risk prediction with preserved EF. The critical need to identify risk predictors for SCD with preserved LV systolic function is currently the largest knowledge gap in SCD risk stratification. Over 13 years ago, we initiated the Oregon SUDS to identify novel risk predictors for SCD. Our published analyses have identified several clinical predictors such as echocardiographic LV hypertrophy and specific EKG measures (QTc, QRS and Tpeak-Tend interval) as markers of SCD risk, independent of the LVEF. Furthermore, from our population-based analyses we have reported that the majority of patients (at least 65%) who suffer SCD do not have a severely reduced LVEF. Both the Oregon SUDS and FHS have the track record and resources to deliver essential information required to identify the SCD high-risk subgroups for future investigations. Given the time and expense limitations of traditional clinical trials, it is likely that future SCD trials will also be conducted using randomization within free living cohorts or registries. This proposal presents an opportunity to improve mechanistic understanding of SCD in this group, and potentially improve methodology for SCD risk stratification in individuals with preserved LV systolic function. This novel approach is likely to have a meaningful and significant impact for enhanced prediction and prevention of SCD, a public health problem of substantial magnitude."
"9468734","ABSTRACT Support is requested for a Keystone Symposia conference entitled Antibodies as Drugs: Translating Molecules into Treatments, organized by Drs Paul W. H. I. Parren and Erica Ollmann Saphire. The conference will be held February 25 ? March 1, 2018 at Whistler Conference Centre, in British Columbia, Canada. Antibodies carry an enormous potential in prophylaxis and treatment of human disease. Antibody therapies may be divided into two distinct but highly related disciplines. First, antibodies can be elicited de novo using vaccines. Our understanding of what constitutes an effective antibody response at the molecular level and the science of eliciting such antibodies in vivo is progressing rapidly. Second, isolated antibodies represent powerful drugs when developed as biopharmaceuticals, as demonstrated by the ever-expanding list of approved molecules as well as by the large number of antibody products in development in a wide range of therapeutic areas. The antibody landscape is changing as the field has moved from empirical to knowledge- based, designer approaches for which understanding of mechanisms of action at the molecular level is critical. Translating such basic knowledge into novel products and applications requires scientists from many disciplines including structural and cellular immunology, biology, engineering, chemistry and medicine to interact closely. Consequently, the field of antibody-based vaccines and therapeutics has become an interface area where experts meet and work together. The 2018 Keystone Symposia conference aims to provide a platform for knowledge-sharing from the molecular to the systems level to navigate the newest developments and insights to prevent, treat and cure major human diseases."
"9388361","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We have recently identified a type of neural activity that reflects the subject's engagement in a task. This task- related activity, which we have measured using both intrinsic-signal optical imaging and functional magnetic resonance imaging, is independent of external visual stimuli and is, instead, linked to internal brain states such as arousal and endogenous attention. Here, we propose a series of experiments that test several hypotheses about task-related brain activity, using a wide range of neurophysiological methods.  Aim 1 will test whether hemodynamic activity (measured with optical imaging or with fMRI) can be separated into a linear sum of neurally distinct stimulus-evoked and task-related components.  Aim 2 will test whether the task-related component is widespread but possibly a function of task modality (e.g. visual vs. auditory) and not spatially global.  Aim 3 will test whether the task-related component reflects the degree of engagement (a form of arousal or attention) and is thus a function of reward, difficulty and timing.  The endogenous processes that we propose to investigate are implicated a variety of neurological and psychiatric disorders. For example, individuals with ADHD demonstrate a wide variety of attentional deficits, but their most pronounced deficits are related to sustained attention, i.e., maintaining a steady level of performance on an infrequent task over a prolonged period of time. It is likely that the task-related component that we are proposing to study is related to sustained attention, and knowledge gained from the proposed experiments may provide insights into ADHD and related disorders."
"9470498","Gastric cancer (GC) is the third leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide, with a median overall survival limited to 1 year for advanced disease. A significant fraction of GC is due to aberrant HGF/MET axis signaling, most commonly due to MET receptor gene amplification. However, no effective MET-targeted therapies are currently available, with resistance frequently emerging rapidly, following an initial response. The development of additional, alternative approaches to effectively inhibit MET and other RTKs is therefore a necessity for a cure to be found.  We recently identified a number of novel soluble decoy RTKs isoforms (sdRTKs), generated by an alternative splicing/intronic polyadenylation (IPA) mechanism, which can act as potent natural inhibitors of RTK signaling. We developed an antisense-based method to specifically and effectively induce IPA usage and sdRTKs expression in vitro and in vivo. These compounds identify a new class of drugs that carry the advantage of simultaneously knocking down the pathological targets while introducing natural dominant-negative isoforms, thus greatly increasing their efficacy.  We will apply this antisense-based approach to promote IPA and stimulate the expression of dominant-negative, endogenous soluble decoy MET inhibitory variants (sdMET), normally expressed at low levels. sdMETs encode the extracellular ligand-binding and dimerization domains, but lack the transmembrane and the intracellular kinase domains. We hypothesize that sdMET-inducing compounds suppress HGF/MET signaling by a three fold-mechanism: A) direct removal of full-length MET receptor mRNAs, B) binding and sequestration of MET ligand (HGF), and C) non- productive hetero-dimerization with residual MET receptors. We further posit that, as the resulting products are secreted from targeted cells, they affect signaling in both targeted and neighboring cells alike and interfere with paracrine and autocrine loops, thus wielding an amplified effect. Since the mechanism of action is different from that of current therapies, this strategy should be effective in all tumors that rely on HGF/MET signaling, including relapsing ones. To this end, we will pursue the following specific aims: 1) Identification and characterization of effective inhibitory sdMET splicing variants. 2) Reprogramming of MET splicing/polyadenylation in gastric cancer cells by antisense-based splicing redirection compounds that induce IPA. 3) Assessment of the therapeutic potential of sdMET-inducing antisense oligonucleotides in multiple gastric cancer models, in vitro and in vivo.  These results will be important for the development of powerful novel investigative tools and therapeutic approaches in any cancer type where the HGF/MET signaling axis plays a determinant role. The findings emerging from this study will be broadly translatable to disease dependent on other RTKs and oncogenes, in gastric cancer and other tumors. Analogous compounds can in fact be similarly designed to directly target other RTKs or other targets responsible for drug-resistance and pathological signaling, or to overcome various mechanisms of resistance."
"9341943","ABSTRACT Every year there are an estimated 7.9 million children born with a serious birth defect and 3.3 million of these are children under five years of age who die from factors related to their birth defect. Comprehensive, reliable data on birth defects are not available for most developing countries. In many resource-poor settings, the baseline prevalence of birth defects is not known and systematic monitoring for birth defects is difficult or non- existent. Antiretroviral treatment (ART) in pregnancy can maximally reduce the risk of vertical transmission of HIV, and therefore it is recommended that all pregnant women with HIV receive effective ART regimens to prevent the transmission of HIV to their infants. However, there have been concerns about the possibility of women on ART at conception or during the first trimester having an increased risk of delivering an infant with a birth defect. The goal of this proposal is to establish a birth defect hospital based surveillance program in Kampala, Uganda and to determine the prevalence of major external birth defects and association of maternal risk factors including antiretroviral therapy to these defects. Four hospitals in Kampala, Uganda will be included in the surveillance system with approximately 48,000 deliveries per year. Informative births (live and stillborn) regardless of gestational age that are born at the four hospitals will be included in the surveillance project for a duration of five years. Informative births are those in which the newborn is formed well enough to ascertain whether or not there is a birth defect. Each newborn will be examined as soon as possible after birth. Infant measurements (weight, head circumference and length) will be obtained and all newborns will be examined for major external birth defects by trained midwives. Newborns with major external birth defects will be photographed after obtaining consent and the photographs will be used to classify the diagnosis. As needed, the photos and verbatim descriptions will be sent to birth defect experts for confirmation of diagnoses and for coding of the birth defect using ICD-10 disease classification criteria. Demographic information, HIV status and obstetric information (parity status, previous live and still births, presence of physical defects of births of previous children) will be collected for all mothers. Every mother of an infant identified with a major external birth defect of interest will be asked to participate in a case-control study. Three controls will be selected for each case matched on hospital of delivery. After consenting, each mother will be asked to respond to questions regarding, types of medications taken during pregnancy including antiretroviral drugs and cotrimoxazole, medical history and more detailed demographic information. The surveillance program will provide crucial current data on the baseline prevalence of birth defects in Uganda while the case-control study will allow examination of the possible effects of antiretroviral treatment on infant outcomes while also screening for other common known causes of birth defects."
"9389513","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Myocardial ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury is the most common cause of death in the US. In experimental models, relatively young animals can be protected from I/R injury through activation of protective signaling pathways, but this protective effect is much more difficult to induce in the presence of co-morbidities. Since coronary artery disease occurs primarily in patients with co-morbidities, experimental cardioprotective interventions may not be applicable to the most relevant human population. In addition, males and females have different sensitivities to I/R injury. One signaling pathway that has major importance in cardioprotection is the activation of nitric oxide synthase, which can result in nitrosylation of protein cysteine residues. Directly inducing cysteine modification may be a way of bypassing defective signaling pathways and directly affecting downstream targets of cardioprotection. In this proposal we will study two post-translational modifications (PTMs) of cysteine, S-nitrosylation (SNO) and S-sulfhydration (SSH), both of which have cardioprotective characteristics, and which may interact. Progress in this area has been hampered by the lack of sensitive methods for detecting specific cysteine modifications, and relating this to cardioprotection. One of the benefits of SNO, and potentially SSH, is that it is reversible and it may block cysteines from other oxidative modifications during I/R, preventing irreversible oxidation. To assess the importance of SNO and SSH, we have developed and are developing methods that can detect PTMs of specific cysteine residues in specific proteins. This proposal is to employ these methods that allow SNO, SSH, and oxidation of specific cysteine residues to be measured using several mass spectrometry approaches, and allow the proportion of cysteines that are modified to be quantified. Aim 1 will examine the molecular mechanisms regulating SNO. We will test the hypothesis that transnitrosylation confers specificity to mitochondrial SNO, regulating which proteins are S- nitrosylated. We will assess the mechanisms that localize SNO signaling and examine how caveolar signaling by eNOS leads to preferential SNO of subsarcolemmal mitochondria. Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that SSH enhances cardioprotection in part by cross talk with SNO. We will examine the role of protein SSH in cardioprotection, determining specific sites of SSH, sex differences in SSH, and the interaction between SSH and SNO modifications. Aim 3 will evaluate the effect of SNO and SSH on the function of key proteins by gene editing the SNO sites using novel TALEN and CRISPR methods to generate mice in which key cysteines are mutated to serine or alanine to evaluate the effect of these PTMs on cardioprotection. The innovative aspects of the project are the novel hypotheses, the novel methods for directly identifying and quantifying SSH, and the development of novel genetic mouse models to test the role of specific PTM sites in cardioprotection. The results of these studies will provide insights into the mechanisms of cardioprotection and may suggest approaches to bypass defective signaling pathways to directly protect the heart from I/R injury."
"9410527","SUMMARY Nicotine is a major component of nicotine delivery systems [Electronic Nicotine Delivery Systems (ENDS)] i.e. electronic cigarettes (e-cigs). Nicotine is known to have the addictive properties, and a knowledge gap exists on how inhaled nicotine affects the pulmonary system. Our supporting data show that ENDS nicotine aerosol delivery and exposure cause oxidative stress and inflammatory responses in human lung epithelial cells, fibroblasts, and in mouse lungs. Currently, no information is available on the biological effects of e-cig containing inhaled nicotine in humans and in mouse models. Inhaled nicotine may contribute to the pathogenesis of lung diseases in particular via lung inflammation, injurious, and dysregulated repair responses. We hypothesize that e-cig nicotine influences toxicity as evidenced by oxidative and inflammatory responses in humans and in mouse models, leading to dysregulated repair and emphysematous responses. Three specific aims are proposed to test this hypothesis: Aim 1: Inhaled nicotine induces lung and systemic inflammatory mediators in human subjects Determine the impact of inhaled nicotine in users and non-users of e-cigarettes. This will be accomplished by monitoring biomarkers of exposure (inflammatory, exosomes and lipid mediators by lipidomics) in human biofluids (saliva, Exhaled Breath Condensate, plasma, and urine) along with clinical outcomes (lung function tests) in a prospective cohort study (baseline and follow-up). Along with human studies, we plan to conduct mechanistic studies in vivo and in vitro. Aim 2: Inhaled nicotine induces lung inflammatory and dysregulated repair responses via its receptor Here, we will use a mouse preclinical model for mechanistic studies. We will determine if e-cigarettes containing low and high nicotine concentrations have differential pro-inflammatory and abnormal repair effects in vivo via the ?7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (?7nAChR) dependent mechanism. Aim 3: Mechanisms whereby nicotine aerosol induces inflammatory and dysregulated cellular repair responses Determine inflammatory and dysregulated cellular repair responses to e-cigarette nicotine vapor in human lung epithelial cells and fibroblasts using the state-of-the-art reporter models (NF-?B luciferase) as well as a 3-D cell culture model. This will determine how nicotine affects cellular processes, such as early cellular senescence and myofibroblast differentiation, as well as lipogenic and myogenic pathways in healing/repair process.  The outcomes of this study will provide an understanding of the clinical impact and mechanisms of inflammatory, senescence, and dysregulated repair responses following nicotine exposure in human subjects and, in primary lung cells in vitro and mouse model in vivo."
"9392927","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Heart failure (HF) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality, contributing signi?cantly to global health expenditure. Sudden death due to arrhythmia is responsible for over 50% of deaths among HF patients; however, the mechanisms linking HF-induced molecular remodeling to increased sudden death risk remain poorly understood. This has resulted in ineffective pharmacologic therapy for preventing sudden arrhythmic death and in inadequate approaches to arrhythmia risk strati?cation of HF patients. The overall objective of the proposed research is to explore a novel set of mechanisms by which HF remodeling, from the sub-cellular microdomain to the whole heart, leads to increased risk of lethal arrhythmias in human HF. Speci?cally, we propose to investigate how the impact of the degradation of myocyte microdomains on L-type Ca channel and cellular function is ampli?ed regionally by the heterogeneities in electrophysiological remodeling and adrenergic innervation as well as by the disease-induced remodeling in ventricular structure to produce i) arrhythmia triggers and ii) their degeneration into ventricular ?brillation (VF). The project presents an integrated experimental/computational approach to arrhythmogenesis in human HF. Super-resolution scanning patch clamp will provide novel insight into how disruption of sub-cellular compartments affects L-type Ca channel functioning in the HF cell. This data will be used as input into an integrative human HF myocyte model, which following validation, will be implemented in organ-level HF models. Protein and microstructure distribution data informing the organ-level models will be gathered in experiments with explanted HF human hearts. Model components will be combined with MRI scans of HF human heart geometry/structure to develop multiscale HF ventricular models which will then be used to determine the mechanisms responsible for the formation of 1) hot spots, from which triggered activity emanates, and 2) arrthythmogenic substrates at heart rates near rest, causing the degradation of triggered activity into VF. Simulation results regarding the arrhythmogenic substrate and VF likelihood at these heart rates will be validated in a clinical study of HF patients. Completion of the studies proposed here will result in a greater understanding of the mechanisms leading to arrhythmias and sudden death in human HF. Such mechanistic understanding is expected to reduce the impact of HF on its victims and on the health-care system 1) by suggesting targeted and effective new molecular therapies, and 2) by leading to new and improved approaches to arrhythmia risk strati?cation of HF patients."
"9447707","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Nutrients and metabolites can both positively and negatively regulate cell signaling, anabolic metabolism, and proliferation to impact cancer growth. One nutrient that promotes cancer growth is asparagine, an amino acid cancer cells can either take up from the microenvironment or synthesize through asparagine synthetase (ASNS) from glutamine and aspartate. Cancer cell asparagine consumption is already a therapeutic target: L- asparaginase, which digests extracellular asparagine, is a standard-of-care treatment for acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Not surprisingly, leukemic resistance to asparaginase is associated with increased ASNS activity for biosynthesis. We recently reported that intracellular asparagine levels are limiting for cancer cell proliferation and that asparagine is used by cancer cells as an amino acid exchange factor for uptake of amino acids from the microenvironment. This exchange function of asparagine enables mTORC1 activation and downstream promotion of anabolic metabolism. Our preliminary data further suggest that mTORC1, which increases glycolysis along with anabolic metabolism, may be subject to feedback inhibition by lactate, the end product of glycolysis. Lactate is exported in large amounts from cancer cells through monocarboxylate transporters (MCTs), and blocking lactate export reduces tumor growth. Why do cancer cells export so much lactate? Could lactate provide a negative feedback signal to inhibit further anabolism in homeostatic situations? Do cancer cells, which generally express relatively high levels of MCTs, evade this negative feedback mechanism through lactate export? This proposal will investigate mechanisms by which growth-promoting signaling pathways are both positively and negatively regulated by metabolites, and explore ways to therapeutically target this regulation using rational combinations of existing clinical compounds. Specifically, we will: (1) Determine whether respiration supports cancer cell proliferation through asparagine production; (2) Assess rational combination treatment strategies with L-asparaginase to exploit cancer cell dependence on asparagine for growth; and (3) Examine lactate regulation of mTORC1 and activating transcription factor 4 activities. Elucidating nutrient regulation of cancer growth will promote development of better cancer treatment strategies that block tumor growth with limited opportunity for resistance."
"9335537","Access to effective palliative care is a critical public health priority in Tanzania and Africa as a whole, with a recognized need for innovative community-based solutions to a limited palliative care workforce. Mobile technology promises to improve this access for Tanzanian cancer patients; significantly, the feasibility, usability and effectiveness of such applications need to be determined. We hypothesize that a mobile device-based symptom assessment, control and communication application (m-Palliative Care Link (mPCL)) will extend access to palliative care specialists (?specialists?), resulting in symptom control information exchange between specialists, patients, and local health workers, and reduced symptom burden in late-stage cancer patients. mPCL is based on an existing, locally validated, Palliative care Outcome Scale (POS), adapted through this work for mobile delivery. Specific aims are: Aim 1. Design and create a secure mobile communication application (m-Palliative Care Link (mPCL)) to facilitate remote assessment of and communication about patient symptom control needs among specialists, patients/caregivers, and local health workers (user groups). mPCL will: a) enable generation/update of a patient's record by the specialist for ongoing review by the specialist and local health worker; b) deliver POS to the patient/caregiver to complete and return on a secure network via mobile device; c) allow the specialist to communicate with the patient/caregiver and local health worker regarding symptom assessment and control based on existing standards and patient desires; d) track symptom control as a trajectory throughout the patient's illness via collection, storage, and analysis of POS responses. Aim 2. Usability test an mPCL prototype by a combination of hands-on observation/feedback and survey- based assessment of ease of use and suggestions for change among 5-7 participants from each user group. Data will be used to improve mPCL design for subsequent field test (Aim 3). Aim 3. Field test and validate usability of mPCL among 45 late-stage cancer patients to: a) determine the feasibility, acceptability, barriers, and facilitators of using mPCL for communication and action regarding symptom assessment, information exchange, and symptom control; b) further optimize mPCL for a future effectiveness trial; c) determine per patient cost of mPCL implementation; d) gather data on symptom control needs of Tanzanian cancer patients. Aim 4. Collect preliminary data comparing field test symptom outcomes with 45 usual care patients. Usual care patients will be recruited to complete the POS at each outpatient palliative care clinic visit. By comparing usual care symptom-based outcomes and medication type, dose and duration with those of field test patients, we will collect preliminary data on mPCL impact, critical to design of a future large-scale mPCL outcomes study. This work promises to be sustainable and scalable."

"9412387","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): I earned a Ph.D. in Sociology from UCLA in 2006, and an M.S. in statistics from UCLA in 2008. As a student affiliate of the California Center for Population Research, I received a comprehensive education in social demography and social stratification, and rigorous training in research methodology and statistical techniques for analyzing large-scale survey data. During this time, I also developed a technique for linking empirical estimates of individuals' preferences for neighborhoods with agent-based models to explore the segregation dynamics implied by individuals' residential mobility decisions. While this work is at the vanguard of social research, it relies on a primitive and highly unrealistic conception of individuals' residential choice behavior. This is not unique to my research. The statistical models used in quantitative social science and public health research are rarely (if ever) a plausible model of the underlying behavior or decision-making process that gave rise to the social phenomenon under investigation. Over the past year, I have learned that researchers in departments of Marketing at business schools have highly sophisticated statistical models of how people navigate their environment and make decisions, which draw on insights from cognitive science and decision theory. But these methods have never been applied in population health, for example, to how people choose among neighborhoods, schools, jobs, or entrees in a cafeteria.  Based on my initial forays into this area, I have found marketing choice models are orders of magnitude more difficult to master than techniques I have taught myself in the past. There is no standard statistical software, and the programs are usually written from scratch; there is no single model or methodological approach, but rather a loose toolkit of techniques or strategies that are customized to a specific application. In addition, the models often require Bayesian estimation techniques (which require significant expertise outside of standardized software packages). The K01 Mentored Research Scientist Award would provide protected time for me to: (1) master the statistical skills involved in estimating these models, an gain a formal understanding of the underlying theories of decision-making; (2) adapt the marketing statistical models to new substantive applications-the study of residential mobility and mate choice (as observed on an online dating site); (3) develop a methodological framework for linking these cognitively plausible models of individual decision-making with agent-based models to understand the implications of decision strategies for aggregate population dynamics; and (4) explore how this statistical framework may be applied to a broader range of decision-making applications relevant to health research. I have developed a course plan to provide more formal training in the statistical techniques and theoretical frameworks that underpin the statistical models of decision-making used in marketing research. In addition, I intend to get a comprehensive overview of the decision literature in psychology to supplement what has up to now been self-study. I will supplement the coursework in statistical modeling with frequent interactions with my primary mentor, Fred Feinberg. The bulk of my training will take place at the University of Michigan, where Feinberg and Diez Roux are also in residence. I will have access to the data management, computing, and administrative resources of the Population Studies Center, the Department of Sociology, and the Center for the Study of Complex Systems. Both Sociology and Population Studies have provided me with office space for the duration of the grant period.  My short-term goals are to master the statistical skills involved in estimating these models and gain a formal understanding of the underlying theories of decision-making; and also to adapt the marketing statistical models to new substantive applications-the study of residential mobility and mate choice (as observed on an online dating site). In the longer term, my goals are to develop a methodological framework for linking these cognitively plausible models of individual decision-making with agent-based models to understand the implications of decision strategies for aggregate patterns of social integration or separation; and to explore how this statistical framework may be applied to a broader range of decision-making applications relevant to health research. My proposed research projects apply the choice-modeling framework in two areas of research: mate choice (as observed on an online dating website) and neighborhood choice. These are two specific instances of a general class of choice problems where people choose-with varying degrees of habit or deliberation- from a moderate to large number of potential options. When confronted with this sort of choice problem, decision theorists have repeatedly shown that people tend to invoke screening rules to simplify the choice problem. I will use data from the Los Angeles Family and Neighborhood Survey to estimate cognitively plausible choice models to capture these screening rules at multiple stages. My mate choice project makes use of a rich dataset I recently acquired from an online dating. I will first estimate a multi-stage choice model aimed at identifying the rules used at each stage, and explore how strategies for mate search and mate choice differ across demographic areas. I will later extend our models to allow for learning and adaptive responses. In both the neighborhood and mate choice case, the cognitively plausible choice models will be coupled with realistic agent-based models to explore the co-evolution of individual behavior and the social environment."
"9340349","Tobacco cigarette smoking remains the leading global cause of preventable disease and death killing near- ly 6 million people each year, with most of these deaths occurring in low and middle income countries (LMICs). The potential of mHealth, especially mobile phone-based strategies, to transform health care, change health behaviors, and improve health has particular significance for LMICs where access to health providers and care is limited. Preconception and pregnancy smoking are high in the Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) with life- time negative health effects for the women and their children. There are higher odds of female smoking persis- tence during pregnancy, as well as relapse once pregnant women quit, when the male partner also smokes. It is critically important to address the smoking behavior of couples during their reproductive life.  Building on our work in Romania and other CEE countries, the objectives of this application are to deter- mine in a randomized controlled trial (RCT) whether a mHealth couples intervention shows promise in increas- ing smoking cessation among pregnant couples who smoke and to build mHealth research capacity in Roma- nia. We will build on Self-Determination Theory (SDT) and Motivational Interviewing (MI), a counselling style that is successful in assisting people to quit smoking. The intervention will be novel in its use of the unique functionality of smartphones, its emphasis on the dyadic efficacy for smoking cessation, and the focus on pregnant couples. Our aims are to (1) Test the implementation feasibility, acceptability, and initial efficacy of a culturally-adapted mHealth smoking cessation intervention among couples during pregnancy and postpartum in Romania. We will recruit 60 pregnant smokers and their partners; (2) Develop mHealth research capacity by enhancing individual and institutional research capabilities in Romania and expanding the existing international research network.  The study will generate a base of preliminary evidence that can be used to launch a large scale R01 pro- ject to test the effectiveness of the proposed smoking prevention intervention. With respect to expected out- comes, the proposed application is anticipated to advance understanding of the effectiveness of a proactive mHealth couple intervention enhanced by addressing couples' dyadic efficacy for smoking cessation in reduc- ing pregnancy smoking and postnatal relapse. Such results are anticipated to have a system wide sustainable positive impact on the prevention of prenatal and postnatal family smoking as the intervention has a high po- tential to be adopted in the universal health system in Romania, with applications to the US and other popula- tions. This research is also expected to have a significant impact on the methodology and design of mHealth interventions during the reproductive years. The development of the international research network and the individual and institutional mHealth research capacity building is expected to positively impact mHealth re- search in CEE and the neighboring region applied to tobacco control and other locally-relevant topics."
"9386770","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) is a clinical syndrome of acute lung injury (ALI) characterized by a sudden onset and a profound inability of the lungs to oxygenate the blood (hypoxemia). There are no known therapies for ARDS except using low volumes on mechanical ventilation (MV), which still has an unacceptably high mortality rate of 30%. The combination of sepsis plus MV (`two-hit) significantly increases the risk for developing ARDS. Interleukin-1? (IL-1?) and IL-1? are implicated in the pathogenesis of ARDS. While both IL-1? and IL-1? are produced in a pro form, cleavage of IL-1? is required for its secretion and activation, while both the cleaved and pro-form of IL-1? are active. Our preliminary data indicate that pro- IL-1? is released from necrotic M? after LPS inhalation, which leads to vascular leakage and PMN recruitment into the lungs. However, for maturation and release of IL-1?, activation of the inflammasome is required. We showed that NLRP3 inflammasome is activated in M? by mitochondrial (Mt) dysfunction followed by oxidized MtDNA binding to NLRP3. Mt damage simultaneously leads to activation of repair systems such as autophagy and mitophagy that oppose cell death. Recent reports suggest that both mitophagy and Mt biogenesis may serve a protective role in sepsis and mitigate ALI. We developed a mouse model in which MV triggers M? Mt dysfunction and cell death, and intratracheal LPS followed by MV lead to sequential release of IL-1? and IL-1? secretion and the development of ALI, with PMN infiltration, alveolar edema, chemokine secretion, and hypoxemia. When IL-1? signaling was disrupted by the absence of caspase-1 or NLRP3, or by IL-1R antagonist, mice demonstrated equal levels of inflammation compared to controls, but failed to develop hypoxemia, indicating that the mechanism of hypoxemia in ALI is dependent on IL-1 signaling. Both endothelial cells (EC) and smooth muscle cells (SMC) have been implicated in the mechanism of ALI-induced hypoxemia and are targets of IL-1 signaling. These observations lead us to hypothesize that the development of ALI and hypoxemia in LPS+MV requires sequential release of IL-1? from LPS-induced necrotic M?, followed by IL-1? secretion by NLRP3 inflammasome activation in AM during MV. Mitophagy and mitochondrial biogenesis oppose LPS+MV induced acute lung injury and hypoxemia by inhibiting inflammasome activation and preserving tissue function. To test these hypotheses we propose the following specific aims: 1) Determine the role of IL-1? in the development of hypoxemia in LPS+MV acute lung injury. 2) Determine the role of IL-1 signaling in LPS+MV-induced hypoxemia. 3) Determine the role of mitophagy and mitochondria biogenesis in LPS+MV acute lung injury. These studies will help determine novel mechanisms underlying IL-1? and?? dependent hypoxemia in ALI and ARDS, and will identify a new area of potential therapeutics for sepsis patients with ARDS on MV, a condition that still carries over 30% mortality rate for which no treatments currently exist."
"9402102","Summary Despite recent advances in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine, heart failure (HF) continues to be the leading cause of death in the U.S., and the rest of the western world. Therefore, our long-term goal is the development of new, minimally invasive tissue-engineered therapies for the treatment of ischemic and nonischemic cardiomyopathy. While cell therapies have been extensively studied for the treatment of MI and HF, meta-analyses of initial cell therapy trials suggest only a modest effect on cardiac function. More recently acellular biomaterials have shown great promise in providing similar or greater functional benefit without the complications associated with cell delivery. Injectable biomaterials that stimulate endogenous repair are an attractive alternative since potential therapies could still be delivered minimally invasively via catheter, yet could be off the shelf and have significantly reduced costs compared to cell products. The PI's lab developed the first cardiac specific injectable hydrogel, which is derived from decellularized porcine myocardial extracellular matrix (ECM) and is deliverable via a transendocardial injection catheter. This material is liquid at room temperature and forms a porous and fibrous scaffold upon injection, which we have shown promotes endogenous cell infiltration and cardiac repair in subacute MI models (injection 1-2 weeks post-MI). This initial work lead to the recent initiation of a clinical trial in post-MI patients. In pre-clinical studies, we showed that injection of the material alone post-MI results in decreased borderzone cardiomyocyte (CM) apoptosis, activation of potential endogenous progenitor cells, a pro-remodeling vs. pro-inflammatory environment, increased neovascularization, reduced fibrosis, a shift in CM metabolism, and increased cardiac muscle, yielding significant improvements in both regional and global cardiac function. Under our previous R01, we were successful in beginning to decipher mechanism of action of this material as well as push forward with translation into patients. In this renewal, we will continue to pursue both basic and translation research goals. We propose to continue to better understand the mechanism of action of the material in the context of subacute MI, specifically answering the remaining question of how the hydrogel increases cardiac muscle. Given the strong need for therapies for acute MI, ischemic HF, and nonischemic HF, we are also proposing studies to enable translation of this material into other patient populations. We hypothesize that the myocardial matrix hydrogel, which contains cardiac specific cues, results in the generation of new cardiac muscle in the context of MI, and that the material can be delivered alone to improve cardiac function in acute MI, as well as ischemic and nonischemic HF.

"9576973","Project Summary/Abstract Sepsis is a severe condition that often results in life-threatening multiorgan dysfunction. This proposal describes a 5-year research and training program that will permit Dr. Stephen Standage to develop as an independent investigator conducting clinically relevant, basic and translational research in sepsis pathogenesis. Having completed fellowship training in pediatric critical care medicine and building on a background of basic research training in sepsis immunology, the applicant seeks to develop new knowledge and skills to investigate how regulation of metabolic pathways influences organ dysfunction in sepsis with an objective to identify key mechanisms and therapeutic interventions that may improve patient outcomes. This research project specifically focuses on elucidating how PPAR? influences cardiac energy production and heart function in sepsis. PPAR? is a nuclear hormone receptor transcription factor that regulates many inflammatory and metabolic processes. Previous research has demonstrated that children with septic shock have significant downregulation of PPAR? in peripheral blood leukocytes. The applicant's preliminary studies demonstrated that mice lacking PPAR? (Ppara-/-) have much higher mortality in experimental sepsis, but reconstitution with bone marrow from wild type mice did not rescue the mortality phenotype, indicating a critical role for tissue PPAR? in regulating organ injury and mortality in sepsis. Septic Ppara-/- mice have elevated plasma and tissue markers of severe cardiac injury and show decreased heart function compared to wild type mice, findings that are associated with lower fatty acid oxidation in the Ppara-/- group. Collectively, these data support the overall hypothesis that PPAR? preserves cardiac function in sepsis by activating fatty acid oxidation and that augmenting cardiac PPAR? signaling will improve survival. The specific aims of the proposed investigations are to: 1) Define the role of PPAR? expression in heart function and survival in sepsis using a novel transgenic, cardiac-specific PPAR? knock-out mouse and a mouse strain that over-expresses PPAR? in the heart; 2) Identify the metabolic pathways that influence PPAR? dependent cardiac function in the heart by measuring cardiac ATP production and substrate utilization, tissue gene expression and metabolite levels, and by evaluating mitochondrial structure and function; and 3) Determine whether pharmacologic PPAR? activation ameliorates septic cardiac dysfunction and improves survival. This work is significant and has high translational potential because PPAR? signaling is a targetable mechanism with FDA approved agonists already on the market. The hypotheses evaluated here challenge the prevailing paradigm that sepsis morbidity and mortality result from immune dysregulation and findings will have the potential to reframe the approach to treating this significant public health problem."
"9402111","Project Summary Endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) is a key enzyme involved in the regulation of vascular tone and altered eNOS activity leads to endothelial dysfunction and atherosclerosis. Post-transcriptional modulation of eNOS mRNA stability is a major determinant of eNOS expression in vascular endothelium. The molecular mechanisms regulating eNOS mRNA stability remain poorly understood and represent an important gap in knowledge. This competitive renewal application proposes to investigate the molecular mechanisms by which eNOS mRNA stability is regulated. Preliminary studies suggest that the binding of Polypyrimidine Tract Binding Protein 1 (PTB1) to the eNOS mRNA 3?-UTR leads to decreased eNOS mRNA stability and expression. Moreover, we found that PTB1 specifically interacts with the mammalian Ste20-like kinase 1 (Mst1), an upstream serine/threonine-specific protein kinase of the Hippo pathway, which leads to PTB1 phosphorylation and decreased eNOS mRNA stability and protein expression in vascular endothelial cells. Our preliminary data further demonstrate that Mst1 kinase is activated in the atherosclerotic lesions and blocking Mst1 activation by overexpression of dominant negative protein (DN-Mst1) (K59R) in vascular endothelial cells markedly increased eNOS mRNA stability and expression, implicating a functional significance of Mst1 kinase in regulating endothelial functions. We therefore hypothesize that hyperlipidemia-induced activation of Mst1 promotes the binding of PTB1 to eNOS 3?-UTR, which in turn downregulates eNOS expression and causes endothelial dysfunction in the atherogenesis. Accordingly, we propose three comprehensive specific aims to delineate how the regulation of PTB1 by Mst1 kinase affects eNOS mRNA stability and expression, and the extent to which this contributes to the pathogenesis of endothelial dysfunction and vascular disease. Specific aim 1 will examine the functional significance of Mst1 in regulating eNOS mRNA stability by PTB1. We will identify the Mst1 specific phosphorylation site(s) on PTB1 and then determine whether phosphorylation of PTB1 by Mst1 alters the binding affinity of PTB1 to the eNOS 3?-UTR, leading to decreased eNOS mRNA stability and protein expression in vascular endothelial cells. Specific aim 2 will determine whether PTB1 induces eNOS mRNA instability by inhibiting 3?-polyadenylation of eNOS mRNA and/or by increasing the binding of microRNAs to the eNOS 3?-UTR. Specific aim 3 will determine whether the Mst1/PTB1 pathway regulates endothelial dysfunction in vivo. By using our newly generated endothelial specific DN-Mst1 transgenic and Mst1 knockout mice, we will investigate whether eNOS expression, endothelium-dependent vascular relaxation, and atherosclerosis are altered by specifically blocking Mst1 activation in vascular endothelial cells. We envision these will establish the importance of Mst1 as a therapeutic target for improving endothelial function and decreasing cardiovascular disease."
"9402104","Repair and regeneration of the injured heart with new, functional cardiomyocytes remains a daunting challenge for cardiovascular medicine. Following cardiac injury, fibroblasts enter injury zone and through various processes actively impair contractile function. Converting cardiac fibroblasts within scar tissue into functional cardiomyocytes is a therapeutic approach that has great potential to restore the function of an injured heart. We were the first to identify a combination of miRNAs, miR combo (miR-1, miR-133a, miR-208a, and miR-499- 5p) that directly reprogrammed cardiac fibroblasts into cardiomyocytes, whereas others have used transcription factors to the same effect. Importantly, delivery of miR combo using lentivirus or retrovirus led to a modest, but significant, improvement in cardiac function. This application is focused on improving miR combo as a therapeutic by identifying ways to enhance efficiency, cell specificity, and effectiveness. Preliminary studies have identified an Adeno-associated virus (AAV) serotype that specifically targets fibroblasts and, moreover, displays enhanced transduction efficiency in vivo. Furthermore, TLR3 activation, which strongly augments miR combo directed reprogramming in vitro, may be a novel way to increase effectiveness. Finally, several transcriptional inhibitors have been identified as miR combo targets. These transcriptional inhibitors repressed the expression of key cardiac transcription factors, suggesting a mechanism for miR combo directed reprogramming. Three overlapping areas will be investigated in this project. Aim 1 will focus on optimizing the efficiency, effectiveness, and cell specificity of miR combo in vitro. To that end we will test if the self- complementary (sc)AAV 2/1 expressing a polycistronic miR combo results in the fibroblast-specific delivery of miR combo. Pharmacological agents will define the appropriate level and duration of TLR3 activation for optimal enhancement of miR combo mediated reprogramming. Aim 2 will address the same questions in vivo. Speckle tracking echocardiography will determine changes in regional wall motion in vivo. Histology will quantify fibrosis levels and lineage tracing will evaluate reprogramming of fibroblasts into cardiomyocytes. Pharmacological agents will be used to determine if TLR3 activation enhances the functional improvements that follow fibroblast reprogramming by miR combo. Aim 3 will define the mechanism by which miR combo promotes reprogramming. Gain- and loss-of-function approaches will determine the role of the transcriptional repressors in miR combo directed reprogramming. Luciferase assays will be used to delineate the physical interaction between the miRNAs within miR combo and the transcriptional repressors. Decoy inhibitor approaches will define the role of NF?B, the key transcription factor in the TLR3 pathway, in miR combo directed reprogramming. Findings from these studies will provide important new insights into improving the efficiency, effectiveness, and cell specificity of direct reprogramming for cardiac repair and regeneration as a therapy."
"9388294","DESCRIPTION (provided by the applicant): The Miami CTU plans to continue to make substantial contributions to the treatment and prevention of HIV/AIDS. The CTU is structured to participate in four NIAID HIV/AIDS Clinical Research Networks to deliver high impact ground breaking research, as well as, to respond to the rapidly emerging needs of the networks. To accomplish these goals the Miami CTU intends to build upon 25 years of major contributions to the treatment and prevention of HIV infection through continuous NIAID HIV/AIDS research funding. With one of the highest incidences of HIV/AIDS in the U.S. in the Miami metropolitan area, more than 25 years of experience in the design and implementation of clinical trials places the Miami CTU in a unique position to recruit and retain diverse patient populations that are severely impacted by the epidemic. Moreover, the breadth and depth of scientific expertise allow the Miami CTU to contribute to the scientific agenda of the NIAID HIV/AIDS clinical trials networks to address the national priorities for HIV/AIDS research and the needs of the Miami metropolitan affected population. To meet these goals, we intend to establish a Miami HIV/AIDS Clinical Trials Unit (CTU) under multiple PI direction through the integration of the Miami AACTG and IMPAACT groups and the Integrated HIV prevention strategies Vaccines to prevent HIV infections clinical research network. The Miami CTU also integrates three clinical research sites (CRS) into the CTU to effectively meet the needs of the diverse patient populations and of the clinical research networks. The CTU and associated CRS are structured to foster synergy and promote economy of scale, resulting in tangible added-value to the research agenda of the NIAID clinical trials network.        RELEVANCE: The mission and overall goal of the Miami CTU aligns with the Networks to reduce the burden of disease and infection and to develop transformative, hypothesis-driven clinical studies that test innovative approaches for the treatment and prevention of HIV infection."
"9399655","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recent studies have demonstrated that Olfactory Receptors (ORs) play important physiological roles as chemosensors in tissues beyond the nose. We have reported that one of the ORs expressed in the kidney, Olfactory Receptor 78 (Olfr78), plays an important role in blood pressure (BP) regulation. Intriguingly, the ligands for this receptor are short chain fatty acids (SCFAs), which are metabolites produced by the gut microbiota. The key role of Olfr78 in modulating BP is clearly demonstrated by the hypotension (~13mmHg) observed in mice null for Olfr78 (Olfr78 KO). However, Olfr78 localizes to multiple tissues that influence BP regulation - it is not only found in the renal juxtaglomerular apparatus (JGA), which plays a role in renin secretion, but it is also expressed in the peripheral vasculature, where it appears to modulate vascular tone. In this proposal, we will utilize the flox cre system to determine which site of Olfr78 expression is the primary contributor to the hypotension seen in the KO mice (SA1). In addition, because Olfr78 KO mice are hypotensive, we hypothesize that an Olfr78 antagonist would likewise lower BP and would be an extremely useful tool for teasing apart the role of Olfr78 in BP regulation in vivo. Therefore, in SA2, we wil carry out in vitro studies to characterize Olfr78 antagonists (building upon our strong preliminary data), and will determine which compounds are the best candidates for in vivo use. In SA3, we will utilize Olfr78 antagonists in vivo in both wild-type and various KO mice in order to advance our understanding of Olfr78 function. In sum, our data implies that a novel renal OR plays a role in modulating BP regulation in response to changes in gut microbial metabolism. The proposed work invokes a variety of in vitro and in vivo techniques in order to advance our understanding of BP regulation by studying an entirely novel pathway involving a novel renal OR. These studies have the potential to lead to potentially exciting future clinical implications, as our dat suggests that manipulating Olfr78 in vivo has the potential to significantly alter BP."
"9398153","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Heart failure (HF) currently affects approximately 6 million American adults and is associated with a high risk for premature death, hospitalizations and poorer quality of life. Unlike other cardiovascular diseases such as acute myocardial infarction that has declined over time, the burden of HF is projected to increase by almost 50% by 2030. HIV-infected patients may be particularly vulnerable to developing HF, given the known higher risk of myocardial infarction and higher prevalence of vascular risk factors, antiretroviral therapy (ART)-related adverse effects, and direct effects of HIV infection, including immunodeficiency and inflammation. However, to date, HF has received very limited attention in this population. Yet, with increased survival for HIV-infected patients in the ART era, resulting in near-normal life spans, HIV-infected persons are now subject to greater risk for common age-related comorbidities, with particular concern for serious conditions such as HF. To address these key knowledge gaps, this application responds to PAR-15-280 (Multidisciplinary Studies of HIV/AIDS and Aging [R01]). This study aims to identify optimal strategies for both primary prevention of HF and improving outcomes in HIV-infected patients who develop HF. We will conduct this research within the three largest Kaiser Permanente (KP) health systems in the Cardiovascular Research Network's (CVRN) Heart Failure consortium, which has a long history of studying HF epidemiology, management and outcomes. The CVRN and KP are uniquely suited for the proposed study given the long-standing HIV registries, standardized Virtual Data Warehouse, comprehensive electronic medical record, and ability to identify carefully-matched HIV-uninfected controls from the same source population. We anticipate identifying 39,000 HIV-infected and 390,000 high-dimensional propensity-matched HIV-uninfected adults, an unprecedented sample size for a study on this topic. We propose to achieve three complementary specific aims. The first aim is to characterize the association of HIV status with the incidence of HF and HF type (reduced versus preserved ejection fraction). The second aim will investigate clinically meaningful treatment strategies for the prevention of HF and HF types in HIV-infected adults, focusing on the effect of composition and adherence to ART and long-term immunosuppression and viral replication using state-of-the-art causal modeling approaches to emulate the results of randomized trials. Finally, among new HF cases that develop among HIV-infected and HIV- uninfected adults, the third aim will examine the association of HIV status on HF-related hospitalizations and death. Given the negative impact of HF on individuals, families and health systems, we expect these results to help inform key gaps in knowledge regarding HF in HIV-infected patients, including improving primary and secondary prevention strategies in this aging population."
"9390752","Project Summary Aberrant dendrite morphologies have long been associated with neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders, including Autism Spectrum Disorders and schizophrenia. Though many of these disorders show characteristic changes in dendrite development, there lacks a full understanding of the genes and mechanisms that regulate dendrite formation. To expand upon the knowledge of the genetic and molecular basis of dendrite development, this project will employ the use of C. elegans PVD neurons, in which mechanisms of development are known to be conserved. PVD neurons are multi-dendritic neurons that form characteristic candelabra-like arbors, and are polymodal nociceptors. Studies from our lab, and others, have shown that certain conserved extracellular adhesion molecules, including mnr-1/Menorin, sax-7/L1CAM, and dma-1/LRR transmembrane receptor, play a role in regulating dendritogenesis of PVD neurons. However, recent findings suggest that there may be more genes involved in PVD development. This project aims to characterize the phenotypic, genetic, and molecular functions of a novel conserved gene that reveals developmental defects in the C. elegans PVD neurons. To address the hypothesis that the novel signaling molecule works in concert with mnr-1, sax-7, and dma-1 to regulate PVD dendrite branching, experiments addressing the genetic, molecular, and phenotypic roles of the molecule will be performed. Experiments such as double mutant analyses, co-immunoprecipitation, and CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing will be executed to test genetic and physical interactions with mnr-1, sax-7, and dma-1. RNAi mediated knock-down experiments of candidate receptor genes, along with genetic crosses with mutant strains, will be performed to identity a putative receptor and piece together a mechanism of action. Together, these experiments will elucidate the role of a novel conserved signaling molecule in dendrite morphogenesis, helping to create a more complete understanding of the genes regulating neural growth during development and harboring potential for novel diagnoses."
"9392925","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Pulmonary hypertension is a severely debilitating disease with no cure. Morphometric studies revealed that the development of pulmonary hypertension is associated with structural remodeling of the small pulmonary arteries, characterized by thickening of the smooth muscle cell layer and extension of new muscle around previously non-muscular precapillary arterioles. While the former is thought to be due to pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cell (PASMC) hypertrophy, hyperplasia and resistance to apoptosis, the latter is believed to result from PASMC migration. Our laboratory identified a new candidate as a regulator of PASMC migration, proliferation and survival: aquaporins (AQPs). AQPs are a family of proteins that form transmembrane channels which facilitate the transport of water into and out of cells. We have evidence that aquaporin 1 (AQP1), the first family member identified, is expressed in PASMCs, induced by hypoxia and required for PASMC migration and proliferation. Moreover, we have generated exciting data indicating a critical role for the AQP1 C-terminal tail, but not water transport, in controlling these cellular processes. Our preliminary data also indicate that increased AQP1 protein is associated with elevated ?atenin expression, a protein that regulates migratory, proliferative and survival responses in PASMCs. How AQP1 regulates ?atenin levels is unknown, but we show that the AQP1 cytoplasmic tail is required. Finally, while we have strong evidence that AQP1 plays a critical role in mediating PASMC migration and proliferation, whether AQP1 contributes to the development of vascular remodeling and PH remains unknown. Thus, the goals of this study are to: 1) elucidate the mechanism by which hypoxia upregulates AQP1 in PASMCs; 2) identify the mechanism by which AQP1 modulates ?atenin expression and determine whether ?atenin is required for AQP1-mediated changes in cell function; and 3) determine whether AQP1 plays a role in facilitating pulmonary hypertension."
"9457605","Project Summary Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a highly prevalent hereditary cardiac disease with over 1400 mutations identified in 11 genes encoding the protein constituents of sarcomere, the basic contractile units of muscle. However, the molecular mechanisms by which mutations in sarcomeric proteins lead to cardiac hypertrophy and failure remain poorly understood. Sarcomeres are composed of myofilaments flanked by dense protein structures called Z-discs, playing critical roles in controlling contraction and mediating signaling pathways. Moreover, recent evidence has suggested that sarcomeric protein post-translational modifications (PTMs) play essential roles in the modulation of contractile function. Our preliminary data convincingly show that the PTMs of sarcomeric proteins, including multiple key myofilament and Z-disc proteins, are altered in the myocardium of HCM patients as compared to donor hearts. Changes in the expression of myofilament protein isoforms were also detected in HCM patient myocardium. Intriguingly, we have observed consistent alterations in sarcomeric protein PTMs and isoform expression regardless of the mutation types. Thus, we hypothesize that different HCM- causing mutations activate convergent hypertrophic signaling pathways, yielding comparable alterations in PTMs and protein isoforms of the sarcomeric proteins that cause abnormal contractile function and pathological hypertrophy. To test our hypothesis, we will employ a highly interdisciplinary approach featuring top-down proteomics, induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (iPSC-CMs), cardiac tissue engineering, human patient heart tissue samples, and functional studies to delineate the underlying mechanisms of HCM. Our recently established top-down proteomics platform represents a comprehensive tool to detect and characterize HCM-related changes in the sarcomeric proteome with high reproducibility and throughput. Recently, we have made a major methodologic breakthrough that allows us to perform top-down proteomic analysis of minimal amounts of biopsy tissue, as well as iPSC-CMs cultured in either a 2D monolayer or 3D engineered cardiac tissue (ECT). In addition, biochemical analyses will be performed to assess changes in intracellular signaling pathways. Furthermore, we will perform functional measurements to relate sarcomeric protein PTM alterations and maladaptive signaling to contractile dysfunction. We aim to determine: 1) the changes in sarcomeric protein PTMs, key hypertrophic signaling pathways, and mechanical properties in myocardial tissue from HCM patients; 2) the early molecular alterations and functional consequences of different sarcomeric protein mutations in HCM patient-specific iPSC-CMs; 3) the specific molecular alterations and functional consequences in iPSC-CM- ECT from multiple HCM patients carrying the same mutation. This application, enabled by cutting-edge technology, is highly significant with a strong scientific premise and a novel hypothesis. The proposed research has direct translational potential and will lead to an in-depth understanding of the underlying mechanisms in HCM."
"9393831","ABSTRACT The context in which early drinking occurs may be an important, but neglected, determinant of progression to risky drinking behaviors and problems. Early initiation of drinking (i.e., early onset), especially of heavy drinking, has been associated with a range of adverse outcomes for adolescents, including alcohol abuse and dependence, lower academic achievement, risky sex, assaults, traffic crashes, and other substance use. The mechanisms underlying the associations between early drinking onset and problems, however, are largely unknown. These associations may reflect neurological or physiological changes resulting from early onset of drinking; the effects of common predisposing factors (e.g., genetic susceptibility, impulsivity) that increase the likelihood of both early drinking and involvement in problem behaviors; or differential exposure to and selection of drinking environments that enable and maintain heavy drinking and associated problem outcomes. Importantly, some research suggests that early initiation to drinking may be attributable to environmental, rather than genetic or other predisposing factors. No research, however, has investigated the contribution of risky contexts to the development of early drinking onset and the progression to problems. To fill this research gap, we will investigate the contexts in which early drinking, heavy drinking, and intoxication occur. We will obtain detailed characteristics of those contexts to evaluate how they relate to the later development of drinking, other substance use, and problems. The proposed study will use a mixed-method approach consisting of (a) a baseline and six follow-up surveys over 3 years with 1,500 adolescents aged 12-16 years at baseline and (b) qualitative interviews with 25 early onset drinkers recruited from the baseline survey. This longitudinal study will help to understand whether and how specific contexts contribute to maintaining alcohol use over time and the development of alcohol-related problems among early onset drinkers. This study will allow us to investigate why some youths who drink at an early age develop problems and some do not. It will be guided by a socio-ecological developmental model that emphasizes the importance of social interactions and drinking contexts for the development and maintenance of problem behaviors. The specific aims are to: (a) assess the contexts in which the first occasions of drinking, heavy drinking, and intoxication occur and how characteristics of these contexts contribute to continued drinking, heavy drinking, and problems; (b) assess whether and how drinking contexts within the first year of drinking contribute to continued drinking, heavy drinking, other substance use, co-use, and problems; (c) investigate the ongoing associations of social and other contextual characteristics, including influences of close friends, venue-based social characteristics, adult supervision, and alcohol availability, with drinking, other substance use, and alcohol problems among early onset drinkers; and (d) qualitatively investigate how and why early onset drinkers drink in specific contexts. This research will inform effective interventions targeting specific groups, specific contexts, and specific problems in relation to early alcohol use and contexts. For example, by identifying early drinking contexts most closely related to the development of later problems, our results can inform screening and brief interventions with early onset drinkers to prevent the progression to problems."
"9424108","Project Summary: Adult heart disease including heart failure and atrial fibrillation are leading causes of morbidity and mortality in the United States and developed world. Although human pluripotent stem cells or other cardiac progenitor cells have great potential to treat these diseases, fully differentiating them into mature functional ventricular or atrial cardiomyocytes for ventricular myocardial regenerative therapies to treat heart failure, for modeling human ventricular and atrial cardiac diseases in a dish, or for therapeutic drug screening has remained a major bottleneck in the biomedical field for realizing these possibilities. Thus, we propose to address this crucial issue through discovering the cellular and molecular mechanisms that mediate the reprogramming of cardiomyocytes into functional ventricular and atrial lineages. Toward this end, we will interrogate the gene regulatory networks that control cardiomyocyte lineage specification during zebrafish cardiac reprogramming and regeneration and then apply this knowledge to identify key cardiac reprogramming factors that guide the differentiation of human pluripotent stem cells into ventricular and atrial cardiomyocytes. Overall, these proposed myocardial reprogramming studies may provide new approaches to address the long-standing issue of how to direct cells into functional ventricular and atrial cardiomyocytes for human cardiac disease modeling and therapeutic screening in cell culture systems as well as for human cardiac regenerative therapies."
"9407185","Sleep quality during adolescence and young adulthood are increasingly recognized as a common, yet understudied phenomenon, with significant impact on important health-related outcomes across the life-course, including impulsivity, risk taking, obesity, substance use, decision making, criminal justice system involvement and psychopathology. Like many other health-related risk disparities, poor sleep quality (PSQ) is particularly prevalent in low SES inner city neighborhoods. However, unlike many other risk factors for poor health-related outcomes, PSQ is potentially modifiable and could be a cost-effective target for public health intervention. The key to actualizing this potential requires understanding how PSQ relates to other childhood risk factors (various levels of environment: family, home, neighborhood), as well as learning how PSQ operates in conjunction with other factors, e.g., parental substance use, youth decision-making and genetics, etc., known to impact well- being. These interacting processes are particularly understudied during the important developmental stages of adolescence and young adulthood, a qualitatively distinct period for cognitive, emotional and physical development. We propose, therefore, to recruit a sample of youth (N=650) from our Stress and Justice (S&J) Study samples (R01-DA023733 and R01-DA024029, PI: Hoven), consisting of longitudinal investigation of high-risk, hard-to-reach, minority families living in the poorest Congressional District in the US, to conduct a study on the role of sleep in youth (ages 12-24). We will recruit the youth and one of their parents and then, over a 14 day period, obtain objective, continuous measures of the youth?s sleep (actigraphy) and their sleep environment (temperature, noise, and light), as well as the youth?s mental health status and a behavioral decision task will assess reward processing, delay discounting and cognitive control. In addition, we will conduct a comprehensive face-to-face assessment of both the youth and a parent concerning sleep problems, familial and social environment, as well as obtain objective neighborhood safety and quality (e.g., noise, air quality, etc.). Comprehensive data about these youth and their families previously collected as part of the S&J Study (two waves), as well as previously collected DNA, will be available to this Sleep Study. Together, with the high quality objective data collected here, will allow for testing a complex and highly informative model of the relationship of important risk factors for PSQ and its effects on important health- and mental health-related outcomes. By enriching understanding of the role that PSQ plays in the well-being of at-risk youth, this study will provide important information about behavioral entry points for targeted and effective interventions to improve sleep and therefore functional status and overall well-being."
"9593735","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Infectious diseases surveillance programs provide public health workers with important information for predicting and understanding emergence of epidemics, allowing for timely allocation of resources needed to contain the epidemics. Collecting disease agent molecular sequence information is becoming widespread, especially in surveillance of infectious diseases caused by RNA viruses, such as influenza. Phylodynamics is an emerging statistical framework that allows epidemiologists to harness information present in disease agent sequences in order to shed light on spatio-temporal population dynamics of these agents. Although sophisticated Bayesian inferential tools for phylodynamics have emerged in the last decade, these tools concentrate on sequence data alone, failing to integrate other sources of information (e.g. incidence time series data) into the phylodynamic framework. We claim that integrating multiple sources of information will make phylodynamic inference more precise, allowing for sharper predictions of disease dynamics and for statistical testing of scientific hypotheses. To test this assertion, we propose a series of new statistical methods for integration of multiple sources of information into Bayeisan infectious disease phylodynamics. We will start by developing a new Bayesian method for estimation of population dynamics directly from genomic data that combines the coalescent process, a powerful tool from population genetics, with modern Gaussian process-based Bayesian nonparametric inference (Aim 1). Our preliminary results show that the new method is more accurate than state-of-the-art Bayesian phylodynamics methods. Moreover, the proposed Gaussian process framework will liberate us from drawbacks of the current methodology and will allow us to extend this approach further to estimate correlations between the population size fluctuations and other time-varying variables of interest (Aim 2). This extension is significant, because estimating such correlations is of paramount importance to infectious disease epidemiologists and because all current phylodynamic methods are incapable of such estimation. We will also develop a new model to confront currently ignored dependence of times at which disease agent sequences are sampled on the disease dynamics (Aim 2). Explicit modeling of these sampling times should improve both accuracy and precision of the phylodynamic inference. In all our modeling efforts, we will pay close attention to computational feasibility of the proposed methods by designing efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms to perform Bayesian inference. To test our new methodology we will analyze benchmark infectious disease data sets, where available external information about disease dynamics will help us validate our methods. In addition, we will mine publicly available databases in order to perform novel data analysis using our newly developed methodology (Aim 3). One of the main deliverables of this research will be open source software, implementing the proposed new Bayesian phylodynamic methods for integration of infectious disease sequence data with other sources of information. 1"
"9391707","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Remarkable progress has been made over the past decade in the molecular imaging of atherosclerotic lesion. The majority of studies have focused on the peptide based probes, which is monovalent and rapidly cleared from systemic circulation, leading to low targeting efficiency and contrast ratio. Thus, more and more efforts are toward using nanoparticle based molecular probe for targeted plaque imaging due to the tunable pharmacokinetics and multivalency. Of various nanoplatforms, core-shell polymeric nanoparticles are of particular interest owing to the flexible design of structures with accurate control of functional groups for multi- applications. Among an array of biomarkers upregulated on atherosclerotic lesion, chemokine receptors are promising targets owing to their critical roles in the initialization and progression of disease. Recently, we have developed chemokine receptors targeted Comb nanoparticles conjugated with novel peptides and labeled with 64Cu for atherosclerosis PET imaging. These targeted nanoagents demonstrated the sensitivity and targeting specificity in experimental mouse ApoE-/- model. In the proposed project, we will optimize the construction of viral macrophage protein-II (vMIP-II) conjugated Comb nanoparticles targeting a group of chemokine receptors and D-ala-peptide T-amide (DAPTA) conjugated Comb nanoparticles specifically targeting CCR5. Our preliminary PET imaging showed specific accumulation of 64Cu-vMIP-Comb and 64Cu-DAPTA-Comb at the aortic arch in ApoE-/- mice. However, the targeting efficiency and target-to-background ratio need further improvement. Thus, we will increase the number of vMIP-II peptide conjugated on each Comb nanoparticle and optimize the pegylation for enhanced targeting efficiency and reduce the blood circulation for minimized non-specific binding. The preferred vMIP-Comb will be used to determine the sensitivity and specificity in early stage of atherosclerosis. For DAPTA-Comb, we will follow the same strategy to optimize the nanostructure for in vitro screening in CCR5+ cell line. The candidate DAPTA-Com will be evaluated in ApoE-/- mice with significant lesion (Specific Aim 1). Then we will use the candidate vMIP-Comb and DAPTA-Comb to determine whether they can detect variation in atherosclerosis burden or progression. We will further analyze the specific cell type associated with radiolabeled nanoparticles in atherosclerotic lesion and correlate the PET signals obtained with the two nanoagents to the pathological examination including plaque area and macrophage area (Specific Aim 2). We anticipate that the targeted nanoparticles will provide sensitive and specific detection of chemokine receptors at plaque and serve as useful tools to detect the burden and progression of atherosclerotic plaque."

This will build upon our previous and new preliminary studies demonstrating that: 1) shear force can activate latent TGF-?1, 2) thiol-disulfide exchange contributes to the activation process, 3) mice deficient in platelet TGF-?1 are protected from developing cardiac fibrosis in response to pressure overload, 4) Reversa mice develop AS and increased plasma TGF-?1 levels that correlate with shear stress, and 4) both AS and LVAD-implanted HF patients have increased levels of TGF-?1 compared to controls. We will extend our findings by integrating data from biochemical analyses, animal models, and human patient studies. Aim 1 is to test the hypothesis that shear activates TGF-?1 by facilitating thiol-disulfide exchange involving TGF-?1, thiol isomerases, and/or other thiol-containing proteins, such as TSP1 and vWf. Purification of TGF-?1 and other thiol-containing proteins from platelets, proteomic analysis using mass spectrometry, and mutational studies of recombinant proteins will be employed to identify the shear-induced thiol-disulfide exchange responsible for TGF-?1 activation. Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that TGF-?1 is released from platelets and subsequently activated by high shear in vivo using two mouse models: a surgically-induced Ascending Aorta Constriction model to acutely simulate high shear, and a Reversa mouse model that spontaneously develops AS and high shear across the aortic valve. We will assess TGF-?1 release and activation as well as the impact on TGF-?1 activation in mice with a mutation in the latency-associated protein (LAPC33S), whose TGF-?1 cannot be activated by shear and in mice selectively deficient in platelet PDI (PDIflox). Reversa mice have increased levels of TGF-?1 that correlates with shear stress. We will test the role of platelet TGF-?1 and PDI on AS progression by breeding Reversa mice with platelet-specific PF4Cre/Tgfb1flox and PF4Cre/PDIflox mice. A TGF-?1 neutralizing antibody will be used to monitor AS progression as a model for intervention. Aim 3 will test the hypothesis that release and activation of TGF-?1 occurs in vivo by assessment of TGF-?1 levels in AS and LVAD-implanted HF patients. AS patients have elevated TGF-?1 levels compared to controls. TGF-?1 levels will be correlated with AS valve pathophysiology. Whether TGF-?1 levels are decreased after valve replacement surgery will be assessed. TGF-?1 levels are elevated in LVAD-implanted HF patients and associated with the loss of vWf multimers. We will monitor TGF-?1 levels through heart transplantation and correlate with vWf multimers to establish TGF-?1 and vWf-multimers as surrogate markers for the risk of thrombosis and hemorrhage, respectively. Collectively, these studies will illuminate and guide development of potential interventions to prevent AS progression as well as diagnostic tools to detect early complications in post-LVAD implantation HF patients."
"9435196","Deregulation of c-Myc (Myc) is implicated in the pathogenesis of various types of cancers and in many cases contributes to their aggressiveness. There has been enormous interest in developing new cancer therapies that are targeted at Myc. Several small molecule inhibitors have been reported. However, development of these compounds has been limited by a number of issues including rapid metabolism, poor bioavailability, or inability of the drug to reach effective concentrations at tumor sites. Recently, we have also discovered that inhibition of Myc leads to upregulation of glutamine:fructose-6-phosphate amidotransferase-1 (GFAT-1), the rate-limiting enzyme in the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway (HBP) in several cancer cell lines. Simultaneous inhibition of Myc and GFAT-1 results in a drastic increase in the inhibition of the proliferation of tumor cells, suggesting that upregulation of GFAT-1 may represent another barrier that limits the effectiveness of Myc inhibition-based therapy. This application is focused on the development of an improved therapeutic strategy that not only improves the efficiency of delivery to the tumor tissues but also simultaneously blocks Myc and GFAT-1 activities. This will be achieved via the development of a multifunctional nanocarrier that is highly effective in codelivery of a small molecule Myc inhibitor, 10058-F4 and GFAT-1 siRNA. Three specific aims will be pursued in this application. Aim 1 will focus on the development and in vitro characterization of multifunctional carriers that are effective in co-formulating 10058-F4 and GFAT-1 siRNA. Aim 2 will examine the pharmacokinetics and biodistribution of both 10058-F4 and GFAT-1 siRNA in tumor-bearing mice. Aim 3 will investigate the in vivo therapeutic effect of codelivery of 10058-F4 and GFAT-1 siRNA via an optimal nanocarrier. Both human and murine prostate cancer models will be used in this application. Successful completion of this study may lead to not only the development of a new delivery system but also a new mechanism-based therapy. "
"9424205","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Myocardial infarction and ischemic cardiomyopathy are among the leading causes of mortality in the industrial and developing world. Despite therapies to restore coronary perfusion and limit left ventricular remodeling, many patients develop progressive heart failure and suffer unacceptably high mortality rates. Mechanistically, activation of the innate immune system appears to be a common pathway by which the heart responds to injury. However, considerable debate exists whether innate immune responses represent an adaptive or maladaptive event. Recently, we have uncovered a previously unrecognized complexity within the innate immune system. Using a combination of genetic lineage tracing, flow cytometry, and immunostaining, we have demonstrated that the mouse and human heart contain a complex and heterogeneous array of resident macrophage subsets derived from embryonic and adult monocyte progenitors with differing recruitment dynamics and functions. Under steady state conditions, the heart contains at least 2 functionally distinct resident macrophage subsets: CCR2- and CCR2+ macrophages. Resident CCR2- macrophages are derived from embryonic progenitors (yolk sac and fetal liver) and are maintained locally independent of blood monocyte input. In contrast, resident CCR2+ macrophages are derived from adult bone marrow progenitors and are continually replenished by blood monocytes. More recently, we have demonstrated that in the context of cardiac injury, monocytes enter the heart, replace resident immune cells, and differentiate into multiple macrophage subsets. In this proposal we will test the hypothesis that following cardiac injury monocytes infiltrate the heart and differentiate into distinct macrophages subsets with divergent functions. We further hypothesize that monocyte recruitment and monocyte fate specification are differentially regulated by opposing functions of resident cardiac macrophages: resident CCR2+ macrophages promote monocyte recruitment and the differentiation of inflammatory monocyte-derived macrophages, while resident CCR2- macrophages suppress monocyte recruit and promote the differentiation of reparative monocyte-derived macrophages. Lastly, we will define the molecular mechanism by which resident CCR2+ macrophages recognize injured cardiomyocytes and trigger inflammatory responses. Clinically, the development of therapeutics that uniquely target specific macrophage subsets and/or modulate monocyte fate decisions may offer a new avenue to improve outcomes for patients with ischemic heart disease."
"9447833","ABSTRACT  Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is characterized by pulmonary vasculature remodeling and elevated pulmonary artery pressure that leads to progressive right-sided heart failure and death. Growing evidence indicates that genetic susceptibility, inflammation, and metabolic shifts in the pulmonary vasculature play key roles in PH pathogenesis. The mechanisms that underlie PH remain enigmatic because of its tremendous complexity. Consequently, current therapy for PH is limited primarily to vasodilation. In this application, we target one of the more proximal signaling hubs in the pathogenesis of PH?insulin receptor substrate 2 (IRS2), a critical molecule in insulin resistance and cellular energy homeostasis. Because IRS2 is the main regulator of insulin and insulin growth factor signaling, loss of IRS2 expression promotes insulin resistance and type II diabetes. Indeed, the loss of IRS2 appears to be deleterious in multiple cell types and disease conditions. Although the role of IRS2 in insulin signaling has been studied, very little is known about its contribution to cardiopulmonary pathophysiology, including that seen in PH. Our preliminary data show that IRS2 expression is decreased in hematopoietic cells of patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension and that IRS2 deletion exacerbates macrophage activation to pro-PH phenotype, and perivascular muscularization in a mouse model of PH. Based on our data and other published results, we hypothesize that IRS2 possesses anti-inflammatory and anti-hyper-proliferative activity in the pathogenesis of PH, and that loss of IRS2 in bone marrow-derived cells enhances vascular inflammation and promotes a hyper-proliferative microenvironment. Hence, IRS2 might be valuable as a novel biomarker for PH, and restoring IRS2 expression and function might represent a novel therapeutic target for multifactorial PH pathophysiology. Specific Aim 1 will investigate the correlation between IRS2 expression in lymphoid cells and the clinical characteristics of patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension. Specific Aim 2 will determine the anti-inflammatory role of macrophage-derived IRS2 in pulmonary vascular remodeling and PH development and examine whether IRS2 influences macrophage activation to a pro-PH phenotype. Specific Aim 3 will test the hypothesis that IRS2 and 5' adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling integrate several key pathways implicated in pulmonary artery smooth muscle cell proliferation and that restoring IRS2 by adenoviral gene therapy will reverse experimental PH. The goal of this proposal is to unravel the unrecognized protective role of IRS2? specifically its ability to suppress inflammation and hyper-proliferative activity during PH development. Thus, the data generated will support the development of new agents that target multiple downstream inflammatory, neoplastic, and metabolic mediators of this pathway that can be used for treatment of right heart failure and PH."
"9389522","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Research in vascular biology and cardiovascular science is rapidly progressing. At the same time, however, physician scientists have increasing clinical responsibilities which they must personally attend to in order to fulfill reimbursement an insurance requirements. Additionally, with the aging of the population, the number of patients with vascular disease is increasing. Thus, there is less time for research in vascular biology and cardiovascular science and fewer physician scientists are advancing the discipline. With this background, it is clear that proper training in research in vascular biology and cardiovascular science is critical for those physician scientists who will be the leaders in our field over the net decade(s).  The current proposal is a continuation of the successful T-32 program providing research training in vascular biology, now completing 10 years in existence Vascular Surgery: Research Training in Vascular Biology. The program provides MD trainees with a basic science/translational science curriculum, or a health services outcomes science curriculum. A great strength of the program is the cross fertilization between the two curricula with common elements of training for both pathways. Training is centered at the new North Campus Research Complex (NCRC) and at the University of Michigan Samuel and Jean Frankel Cardiovascular Center. The North Campus Research Complex is one-of-a-kind, with U-M resources and crucial scientific core facilities, NCRC's environment is specifically designed to foster collaboration and innovation. NCRC has 28 buildings comprising 2.1 million square feet of office, research and manufacturing space acquired from Pfizer in 2009. Opening in 2007 the Cardiovascular Center localizes all primary services included in the care and treatment of cardiovascular disease. Faculty for the program come from multiple disciplines including Vascular Surgery, General Surgery, Cardiac Surgery, Internal Medicine, Cardiovascular Medicine, Emergency Medicine, Human Genetics, and Pathology. There is a didactic component to the proposal, in addition to the trainee working intensely with individual scientists from the Program Faculty.  The common thread in this program is the emphasis on the study of vascular biology and cardiovascular science with the ultimate goal to provide the next generation of leaders in academic vascular biology and cardiovascular science."
"9388371","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this proposal is to determine if MUC18 enhances pro-inflammatory responses to viral and bacterial infections in allergic lungs. MUC18 is a transmembrane glycoprotein that is normally expressed on endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells. We have generated highly novel data linking MUC18 to the elaboration of pro- inflammatory cytokines in airway epithelial cells and alveolar macrophages that are exposed to IL-13 (a key Th2 cytokine in asthma). We identified a significant increase of MUC18 in human asthmatic airway epithelial cells and alveolar macrophages, and induction of MUC18 in these cell types by IL-13. By using MUC18 knockout, knockdown or over-expression approaches, we discovered that MUC18 enhances airway epithelial and lung macrophage pro-inflammatory cytokine (e.g., IL-8 and TNF-? production in response to human rhinovirus, various strains of bacteria and Toll-like receptor (TLR) agonists. Importantly, MUC18 knockdown in IL-13-exposed mouse lungs significantly reduced inflammation (neutrophils and chemokine KC) following bacterial infection. Finally, we have identified MUC18 specific intracellular phosphorylation sites that regulate its function. Our innovative research in MUC18 leads to the hypothesis that MUC18 up-regulation in allergic lungs amplifies inflammatory responses to various pathogens, leading to asthma exacerbations. Aim 1 will determine the mechanisms of MUC18 up-regulation by pathogens in allergic lungs. By using primary human airway epithelial cells and lung macrophages, mouse models of IL-13 exposure and viral/bacterial infection, and gene knock-down and overexpression strategies, we will test if pathogen infection activates mitogen-activated protein kinases through TLR signaling, which subsequently increases the activity of transcription factor specificity protein 1, and amplifies MUC18 up-regulation in Th2 cytokine-exposed lung cells. Aim 2 will define the pro-inflammatory function of MUC18 up-regulation during viral and bacterial infection. By using primary human cell cultures, mouse models of allergen exposure and viral/bacterial infection, and MUC18 conditional knockout mice, we will test the hypothesis that MUC18 up-regulation in allergic lungs promotes pro-inflammatory responses to pathogen infection. Aim 3 will dissect the mechanisms of MUC18 pro-inflammatory function. By using MUC18 mutants and transgenic mice over-expressing human wild-type MUC18 and a human MUC18 mutant, we will test the hypothesis that following pathogen-mediated activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases, MUC18 cytoplasmic tail is phosphorylated, resulting in NF-?B activation and amplified production of pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g., IL-8 and eotaxin).  Completion of our proposed studies will greatly improve our understanding about MUC18 pro-inflammatory function during various viral and bacterial infections in asthma. Our research findings will provide new and broad strategies (e.g., anti-MUC18 therapy) to prevent and treat acute exacerbations of asthma."
"9426965","PROJECT SUMMARY Acute kidney injury (AKI) due to ischemia is a common clinical condition, which is associated with poor patient outcomes, including high risk for mortality and development of chronic kidney disease. Following ischemic AKI, peritubular endothelial cells contribute to tissue injury by promoting inflammation and interfere with renal recovery through impaired revascularization. Key regulators of hypoxic vascular responses are Hypoxia- Inducible-Factors (HIF)-1 and ?2, transcriptional factors whose activity is inhibited by proly-hydroxylase domain proteins 1 to 3 (PHD1 to PHD3), PHD2 being the main oxygen sensor. Our recent study was the first to identify a crucial role for endothelial PHD2 in post-ischemic renal injury but the underlying molecular mechanisms remain undefined. Identification of the mechanisms whereby endothelial PHD2 regulates post-ischemic renal injury and inflammation may create novel and targeted therapeutic opportunities in the field of AKI. In this proposal, we hypothesize that inhibition of endothelial PHD2 suppresses post-ischemic renal inflammation and promotes revascularization through HIF-dependent induction of metabolic reprogramming in endothelial cells. To test this hypothesis, we propose three specific aims. Aim 1 defines the role of endothelial PHD2/HIF axis in post-ischemic kidney injury and inflammation by investigating how disrupting HIF-1 or HIF-2 affects the post- ischemic kidney microenvironment in the context of endothelial PHD2 deficiency. Aim 2 examines the role of endothelial PHD2/HIF signaling in post-ischemic kidney repair and revascularization using genetic models, which allow acute endothelial specific inactivation of PHD2 alone and concurrently with either HIF-1 or HIF-2 after the induction of ischemic kidney injury. Aim 3 defines how alterations in glycolysis and mitochondrial respiration induced by hypoxic signaling affect endothelial inflammatory and angiogenic responses. The proposed research is innovative because we investigate the role of PHD2/HIF pathway in endothelial cells, a neglected cell type in the field of AKI, using powerful genetic models. Furthermore, state-of?the art cell culture techniques are employed to determine endothelial phenotypes resulting from PHD2/HIF-mediated metabolic reprogramming. Upon conclusion, we will obtain fundamentally new insights into how endothelial PHD2/HIF axis affects post-ischemic kidney injury outcomes."

In support of this goal, we propose to apply our established, state-of-the-art DNA sequencing and analysis platform to comprehensively identify rare variation influencing susceptibility to common complex diseases corresponding to three disease themes: 1) cardiovascular disease and metabolic risk, 2) autoimmune disease including Type 1 diabetes and rheumatoid arthritis, and 3) developmental and degenerative diseases including cleft lip/palate, idiopathic scoliosis and macular degeneration. Where possible, we will leverage emerging methods and technology to advance the state of the field and achieve our program goals. Our approach extends the discovery power of low-cost whole genome sequencing (WGS) with innovative laboratory and computational techniques to comprehensively interrogate the full spectrum of human genome variation. We developed these studies with substantial input from expert collaborators whose continued involvement and disease-specific expertise will be critical for success. Ultimately, the diversity of our proposed projects - in ters of disease phenotypes, sample ancestries, and study designs - will provide a better understanding of the genetic architecture of common disease and the extent to which it is shared across world populations."
"9444847","The prevalence of childhood obesity in the U.S. has increased dramatically over the past three decades, and the trend has become evident even in the youngest children. Approximately 8% of infants and toddlers have high weight-for-length, which increases risk for developing obesity and other health problems in childhood and beyond. Thus, leading health organizations have identified prevention of obesity in young children as a critical public health challenge. Low levels of physical activity and high levels of sedentary behavior may contribute to the development of excessive fatness in young children, but these relationships have not been fully explored. In children ages 3 and above, accelerometry has been used widely to measure physical activity and sedentary behavior. However, it rarely has been used to measure physical activity levels in infants and toddlers, and then only in cross-sectional studies. No previous study has used accelerometry as an objective measure of physical activity in young children as they develop from infancy to preschool age. Accordingly, little is known about the factors associated with the development of physical activity behavior in very young children, and little is known about the influence of physical activity and sedentary behavior, measured objectively, on development of weight status during the transition from infancy to age 3. The first aim of this study is to describe physical activity and sedentary behavior in young children as they develop from infancy to preschool age. The second aim is to describe the longitudinal associations of weight status with physical activity and sedentary behavior as young children develop from infancy to preschool age. The proposed investigation will employ a longitudinal, observational study design. Participants will be 160 children and their biological mothers living in Columbia, South Carolina. Participants will be recruited through childcare centers, pediatrics practices, churches, and community organizations in Richland County. For each participating child, measurements will be taken at 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, and 36 months of age. At each time point, each child?s physical activity, sedentary behavior, weight status and motor developmental status will be measured objectively, and each child?s mother will complete a survey to assess demographic, social and physical environmental factors; gross motor milestones; parenting practices related to physical activity and sedentary behavior; and dietary practices. Childcare center directors will complete a survey annually to assess center characteristics, and the Environment and Policy Assessment and Observation (EPAO) will be administered in the child?s classroom annually. The proposed research will be significant because it will markedly expand our knowledge of the relationships among physical activity, sedentary behavior and development of adiposity during the first three years of life. The proposed investigation will be innovative because it will be the first to use objective measurement of physical activity and a longitudinal study design in examining physical activity patterns and their associations with development of weight status in children between the ages of 6 and 36 months."
"9386061","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Long term survival post-lung transplantation is limited by development of progressive obstructive ventilatory defect termed bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS). BOS results from fibrotic obliteration of the small airways or bronchiolitis obliterans (BO). Studies from our laboratory have demonstrated that graft-resident mesenchymal cells (MCs) play an important role in fibroproliferation of BO. Exciting new preliminary data suggest that the evolutionary conserved protein kinase mTOR (mechanistic target of rapamycin) within both mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) and mTORC2 contributes to the augmented collagen synthetic function of mesenchymal cell in BOS. MCs derived from patients with BOS were found to possess constitutive activation of both mTORC1 and mTORC2. siRNA-mediated knockdown of rictor, an mTORC2 binding partner, inhibited mTORC1 substrate phosphorylation and reversed the fibrotic phenotype of MCs, suggesting an important role for mTORC2 upstream of mTORC1 in activated fibrotic MCs. Selective ATP competitive mTOR inhibitors which target both mTORC1 and mTORC2 effectors were found to be potent inhibitors of collagen expression in BOS MCs. These data lead us to hypothesize that mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) and mTORC2 play critical roles in BO pathogenesis by mediating translational activation of graft-resident MCs. In this application we propose experiments investigating in vivo role of mTOR pathway in pathogenesis of BO and aim to determine if ATP competitive mTOR inhibitors can be a potential therapeutic option in this disease. To achieve these aims we have established a whole lung mouse orthotopic lung transplant model where a moderate MHC mismatch leads to development of airway fibrosis by day 28. In Aim 1 we propose to investigate mTORC1/2 signaling in the resident MCs in vivo using this murine model. We will utilize mice with BAC florescent labeling of Foxf1, an embryonic lung mesenchyme-associated transcription factor which is highly expressed in lung mesenchymal cells, to specifically identify and study graft-resident MCs. Upstream signaling mechanism(s) that contribute to constitutive mTOR1/2 activation of MCs in BOS will be studied. We will focus on the role of G-protein coupled receptor, lysophosphatidic acid (LPA)1, signaling in a proposed autocrine mechanism of activation. Aim 2 will dissect the role of downstream mTORC1 effectors and dysregulated translation in sustaining fibrotic functions of MCs in BOS. Furthermore, we will utilize state-of-the-art ribosomal profiling (Ribo-seq) to identify genome wide differences in translation between BOS and non-BOS MCs and to delineate the mTORC1 translation controlled gene expression network by studying BOS cells upon complete or partial mTOR inhibition. In Aim 3 we will test if ATP competitive mTOR inhibitors can prevent onset or progression of allograft fibrosis in the murine orthotopic single lung transplant model. The proposed work will be the first investigation of role of mTORC1/2 signaling in lung allograft fibrogenesis and will provide important rationale for future clinical trials targeting this pathway in lung transplantation."
"9378096","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         This project will seek to characterize attentional and inhibitory dysfunction in PTSD using innovative psychological and neuroimaging methods, and will focus on a central unanswered question: are increased attentional/inhibitory failures in PTSD driven by an inability to consistently engage task-positive cognitive control networks of the brain, or rather are they due to inappropriate engagement of task-negative brain networks associated with distraction? Thus, this project will identify the neural networks responsible for attentional disruption in PTSD, by using spatiotemporal patterns of brain activity to predict attentional lapses in real time, as well as to predict clinical diagnosis and severity. The proposal systematically explores sustained attention and inhibitory control in the context of fearful stimuli, as well as in more neutral, everyday contexts, using novel behavioral and fMRI methods developed by the principal investigator. This characterization of attentional and inhibitory control in PTSD will help explain difficulties that these individuals have in everyday life, and will be translatable to therapeutic augmentation and improved neurocognitive-based interventions.  The project will also provide training in neuropsychological, psychiatric, and neuroimaging aspects of PTSD. This will facilitate the applicant's career goal to become a full-time, fully-funded independent investigator researching the neurocognitive injuries facing veterans, and allow the applicant to assume a leadership role as a VA scientist and to help train the next generation of researchers. The applicant is wholly committed to expanding his skills to better the lives of veterans. He intends t continue his career within the VA indefinitely. DESIGN: First, the project consists of a task-based fMRI experiment, which investigates the neural signature of sustained attention and inhibitory control deficits in individuals with PTSD. Participants (n=96) will be drawn from a RR&D TBI Center of Excellence at VA Boston- a large, extremely well-behaviorally characterized sample of OEF/OIF veterans with varying degrees of PTSD. Second, the project includes functional connectivity analyses of resting fMRI data, including multivariate pattern analyses, in an expanded set of individuals from the TBI Center. METHODS: The first set of experiments uses a novel continuous performance task and concurrent fMRI, in order to assess sustained attention and inhibitory control, and the effects of both affective and non-affective distractions. Second, an expanded cohort of participants will undergo MRI scans to examine resting state functional connectivity in core attentional and inhibitory control networks of the brain. Pattern classification (decoding) models of functional connectivity will potentially reveal neurobiological markers of PTSD. OBJECTIVES: Aim 1. Neurally and behaviorally characterize sustained attention and inhibitory deficits in PTSD. Hypothesis 1A. Sustained attention deficits in PTSD+ vs. PTSD- will be exacerbated by distraction, and emotional distraction in particular (neutral and fearful faces). Hypothesis 1B. Sustained attention deficits in PTSD+ vs. PTSD- will be characterized by increased distraction (distraction model) as reflected by inappropriate engagement of the default mode network (mind-wandering) and face-specific brain regions associated with neutral face distractors, and in particular, fearful face distractors. Hypothesis 1C. Independent of distraction, sustained attention deficits in PTSD+ vs. PTSD- will be characterized by failure to consistently engage task- positive brain networks, including the salience and dorsal attention networks (depletion model). Aim 2. Examine PTSD-related alterations in intrinsic functional brain connectivity, using multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA). Hypothesis 2. PTSD will be associated with abnormal connectivity in the 1) Salience network and 2) Dorsal attention network, associated with attentional, inhibitory and emotional control and 3) Default mode network, associated with mind-wandering and task-unrelated thoughts. These connectivity patterns will reliably predict the presence and severity of PTSD."

The studies are critical to determine the nature and location of the cells infiltrating the graft, the role of antibodies in rejection and systemic toxicity of treatment. The techniques that will be utilized include routine histology, immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence, and electron microscopy. Immunoperoxidase techniques with a panel of mAbs will distinguish the infiltrating cell types (Teff, Treg, Breg, et al), adhesion and cytokine molecules and receptors, complement deposition (C4d), and endothelial activation markers (e.g., pERK). Analysis will be enhanced by whole slide digital scans and morphometry. The pathology results will be correlated with functional and molecular studies done in the projects. In addition, complete necropsies will be done on all animals, with samples from all major organs analyzed by routine and special techniques as indicated."

"9438788","Abstract: The long term objective of this application to understand distinct signaling pathways of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), also know as vascular permeability factor (VPF) receptors, in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease. We now know that VEGF receptors are not only expressed in endothelial cells (ECs) but are expressed in several non-endothelial cells like stem cells where they control pathophysiological non- angiogenesis processes. In this grant cycle we will focus on how VEGF-B and its receptors, neuropilin-1 (NRP1) in cardiomyocytes play a protective role in cardiomyopathy, whereas in endothelial cells NRP1 in connection with IFN?R1 promotes proinflammatory response. To test our hypothesis, we have proposed three specific aims. In Aim 1, we will examine the molecular pathways of VEGF-B/NRP1-mediated cardioprotection in CMs both in vitro and in two different cardiomyopathy disease process, myocardial infarction (MI) and virus induced-inflammatory cardiomyopathy (myocarditis) in both mouse and zebrafish models. In Aim 2, we will investigate the role of endothelial cell NRP1 (NRP1EC) in MI and myocarditis using an inducible EC-specific NRP1 knockout mice and zebrafish models. We will also define the regulatory role of IFN?/NRP1EC on inflammatory chemokines in cardiac ECs and related downstream signaling pathwya. Finally, in Aim 3 we will test whether we can treat inflammatory cardiac diseases by boosting mitochondrial function. In this regard, we will use (-) Epicatechin (Epi), which promotes mitochondrial function, to reverse the inflammation and cardiomyopathy in the two models. Epi is derived from plant-based chemicals, particularly from cocoa. Secondly, we will also use anti-CXCL10 antibodies to inhibit the inflammatory responses in similar models. Finally we will test whether combining both Epi and anti-CXCL10 antibody can inhibit advance stages of cardiomyopathy. Overall our proposed study will reveal the molecular mechanism of VEGF-B/NRP1CM as well IFN?R1/NRP1EC signaling in MI and myocarditis and will identify a novel treatment strategy for patients with cardiomyopathy. In addition, the unique pathways and therapeutic strategies that will be developed in this proposal may apply to other chronic inflammatory conditions that affect the heart like atherosclerosis and autoimmune diseases."
"9389541","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Devices capable of probing the elaborate interactions between electrical and chemical (ie. dopamine) neural signals that embody the basal ganglia brain circuits will improve treatment approach of subcortically based disorders and ability to elucidate their pathophysiological mechanisms. The neuroactive chemical, dopamine, along with its major role in controlling basal ganglia operations, are implicated in many debilitating disorders- movement disorders including Parkinson's disease, psychiatric and mood disorders such as depression and anxiety, etc. Current treatment have limited efficacy while the ability to develop better restorative strategies is aggravated by our limited understanding of these complex brain circuits including the role of dopamine signaling known to innervate all basal ganglia structures along with their projection targets across the brain. Furthermore, the targeted basal ganglia areas are situated deep in the brain volume, which limits the methods that can be employed to monitor its activity in situ. The first aim is to employ microfabrication techniques to  manufacture high aspect ratio electrodes with multiple (4) different functions to probe the multifaceted nature of the basal ganglia-local and multi-site recording and modulation of electrical and chemical activity. These injectrodes will be able to record both electrical neural  activity and dopamine fluctuations from a dense micro- array of electrode sites at the site of drug infusion or electrical stimulation. This multimodal probe will allow unparalleled analysis (with superior temporal and spatial resolution) of cell-type specific neural activity in the form o their electrical and chemical signaling domains-essential to understand etiological mechanisms and identify drug targets for brain disorders. Fast scan cyclic voltammetry performed at multi-electrode carbon arrays integrated at the injectrode tip allows for chemical recording of dopamine fluctuations at millisecond timescales at several sites proximal to the site of stimulation or infusion. The injectrode may also afford improved remediation of pathological brain states by adaptively disturbing the aberrant activity based on detected electrical and chemical discharge patterns for closed-loop treatment. The second aim is to validate the injectrode device. Local field potentials and spike activity along with dopamine fluctuations will be monitored in response to locally delivered stimuli in nonhuman primates. These studies will be combined with behavioral studies related to trained saccadic eye movement tasks. Therapeutic efficacy will be determined by measuring both behavioral and physiological neural activity along with physiological response during the long term use of the closed-loop injectrode systems as chronically implanted in rodent models of Parkinson's disease. The proposed studies will generate advanced tools to probe the brain from multiple functional domains and ameliorate aberrant brain circuits in a localized and efficacious manner and may reveal important neurochemical mechanisms critical to basal ganglia functionality. Furthermore, the generated devices may be applied towards in situ high throughput screening of neuropharmacological agents for drug discovery."

Although the incidence of cardiovascular disease deaths has declined, it still accounts for ~1 out of every 3 deaths. Coronary artery disease (CAD) due to atherosclerosis was responsible for most of these deaths. Despite increased knowledge about CAD risk factors and the availably of drugs to treat them, the CAD problem has not been solved. Large human genome wide association studies have identified many common genetic variants associated with CAD, but only a small fraction of the heritable risk has been discovered. Here we propose to perform mouse genetic and genomic studies to identify atherosclerosis modifier genes and genetic modifiers of foam cell lipid droplet metabolism, yielding insights into the mechanisms that regulate these pathways. These findings may lead to novel drug targets and therapies to prevent or treat CAD. The first aim of the proposed studies involves identifying the responsible genes and genetic variation that give rise to the mouse atherosclerosis susceptibility loci on chromosomes 2 and 17, which we have recently independently replicated. Validation will be performed by allele replacement, the gold standard method to demonstrate a direct causal effect of genetic variation on a phenotype. The second aim of the proposed studies involves the study of an intermediate phenotype that we discovered in atherosclerosis sensitive vs. resistant mice. We found that cholesterol ester stored in lipid droplets of macrophage foam cells is metabolized by autophagy with hydrolysis mediated by lysosomal acid lipase, such that the atherosclerosis sensitive strain has lower rates of flux through this pathway, implying that this pathway is atheroprotective. Thus, we propose to use genetic, genomic, and proteomic studies to identify the genetic variant responsible for this intermediate phenotype, and validate the causal genetic variant via allele replacement. Finally, we will probe whether the antiatherogenic effect of mTOR inhibitors in mice is mediated via an induction of foam cell autophagy."
"9385719","Project 3 (P3). Noncanonical activities of a tRNA synthetase in metabolism and atherosclerosis Paul L. Fox, Ph.D., Project Leader Project Summary/Abstract The long-term goal of Project 3 is to understand the noncanonical function of an extraordinary tRNA synthetase, the Glu-Pro tRNA synthetase or EPRS, in diet-induced obesity and consequent cardiovascular disease, particularly atherosclerosis. The recent explosive epidemic of obesity, insulin resistance, and cardiovascular disease has begun an unprecedented decline in the health-span of adults in the U.S., and likewise threatens an equally unprecedented economic burden. In 1942, James Neel suggested a possible rationale for the genetic selection of genes causing these pathologies. He posited that metabolic pathways were naturally selected to efficiently store fat and carbohydrate during periods of food scarcity; however, the same genes and pathways are detrimental during periods of plentiful, calorie-rich food supply as in the Western world today. A kinase cascade involving the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTORC1) and ribosomal protein S6 kinase-1 (S6K1) is implicated as a key metabolic pathway regulating food utilization, and is conserved from Drosophila to humans. Despite intense study, the key downstream effector(s) of mTORC1-S6K1, and consequent cell mechanisms that regulate metabolism remains unknown. During the previous Project period, we made fundamental in vitro and in vivo discoveries that revealed phosphorylated EPRS as a key downstream effector of mTORC1-S6K1, regulating post-transcriptional, inflammation-related pathways in macrophages and metabolic pathways in adipocytes. Inflammatory macrophages permeate the more abundant adipocytes in adipose tissue of obese subjects, and EPRS phosphorylation in both cell types by S6K1 might functionally couple these cells, and contribute importantly to obesity-associated cardiovascular disease. To test the role of phospho-EPRS in these processes we have generated genetically-modified EPRS phospho-deficient and phospho-mimetic knock-in mice. Preliminary studies show that phospho-deficient EPRS mice phenocopy S6K1-null mice, e.g., small size and low fat mass, and will permit rigorous investigation of the role of EPRS in mTORC1-S6K1-driven mechanisms in vivo. We propose to test the following hypothesis: Phospho-EPRS is a critical effector of the mTORC1-S6K1 signaling pathway in both adipocytes and macrophages, and contributes importantly to diet- induced obesity and atherosclerosis. Our discovery that EPRS is a key mTORC1-S6K1 effector activated by agonists of both inflammation and metabolism provides a molecular link between these processes. We anticipate our studies will reveal new mechanisms underlying obesity and atherosclerosis, and can provide novel therapeutic targets for treatment of these related disorders."
"9391006","This proposed study is to advance our understanding of the molecular mechanism of nuclear Bcl-xL in tumor metastasis. B cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) family proteins are known to play an important role in the control of apoptosis and the dysregulation in cancer. Bcl-xL is one of the anti-apoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family, frequently overexpressed in various cancer cells. It controls cellular commitment to apoptosis at the mitochondria and prevents cell death. Abrogating the anti-apoptotic activity of Bcl-xL as well as other anti- apoptotic Bcl-2 members as a putative target of cancer therapy has received significant research attention.  Using an avian virus RCASBP-based in vivo mouse model for pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (panNETs), we found that overexpression of Bcl-xL stimulates metastasis of primary panNETs without blocking apoptosis. We showed that ABT-737, a small molecular inhibitor of Bcl-xL, does not impair Bcl-xL-induced cell migration. We demonstrated that Bcl-xL promotes metastasis independent of its anti-apoptotic activity and its residence at the mitochondria in panNET cell lines as well as breast cancer cell line. We showed that nuclear- targeted Bcl-xL, not mitochondrial Bcl-xL nor Bcl-xL outside the nucleus, promotes EMT and tumor cell migration. Furthermore, Bcl-xL increases H3K4me3 on the promoter of TGF?1 to upregulate the expression, and TGF? neutralizing antibodies block the metastatic function of Bcl-xL in vitro. Based on our data, we hypothesize that the metastatic function of Bcl-xL is attributed primarily to its nuclear function.  To test this hypothesis, we will use multiple experimental systems, which include Bcl-xL mutants, Bcl-xL knockout, doxycycline-inducible overexpression and shRNA, cancer cell lines, and mouse models for human cancer. The findings from cancer cells and mouse models will be cross-examined and the tests reciprocated. Information derived from this proposed study is expected to be useful in establishing the mechanisms by which Bcl-xL promotes metastasis, while providing significant insights into further development of drugs therapeutically targeting Bcl-xL in the treatment of metastatic cancers."
"9395938","Restenosis secondary to intimal hyperplasia (IH) after balloon angioplasty to treat arterial blockages in peripheral arteries is a significant cause of disability and death. The thrombospondins (TSPs) are multifunctional matricellular proteins central to the development of intimal hyperplasia. They are not part of the arterial wall structure, but exert their physiologic effects on arterial structure by binding cytokines, cell-surface receptors, proteases and other proteins. This proposal focuses on three TSPs integral to the development of intimal hyperplasia ? TSP-1, TSP-2 and TSP-5. We have studied the effects of TSP-1 on vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) proliferation and migration and its importance in the development of intimal hyperplasia; however, increasing evidence exists that TSP-2 and TSP-5 have separate and contributory roles in this pathology. All three TSPs are substrates of ADAMTS (A Disintegrin And Metalloproteinase with Thrombospondin Motifs) proteins. ADAMTSs digest TSPs, enhancing or inhibiting TSP function, since the fragments left after digestion have distinct effects themselves on intimal hyperplasia. Therefore, ADAMTS-1,-4, and-7 will also be studied as they are involved in PAD and were also identified to be regulated by TSPs in our prior VSMC gene study. Our long-term goal is to understand how TSPs can be manipulated therapeutically to prevent intimal hyperplasia in vivo. The objective of this proposal is to determine how TSP-1, TSP-2 and TSP-5 specifically contribute to the development of intimal hyperplasia. Our central hypothesis is that the expression, bioavailability, signaling pathways and changes in gene expression induced by TSP-1, TSP-2 and TSP-5 and their interactions with ADAMTSs have distinct effects on regulating the development of IH. This hypothesis was formulated on the basis of our strong preliminary data, our publications and the literature. The rationale for the proposed project is that understanding the roles of TSPs on intimal hyperplasia will result in identification of therapeutic targets to inhibit intimal hyperplasia and restenosis after balloon angioplasty. Our hypothesis will be tested by pursuing the following Specific Aims: 1) determine the role that TSP-1, TSP-2 and TSP-5 each have on intimal hyperplasia; 2) determine the differential effects of TSP-1, TSP-2 and TSP-5 on protein and microRNA expression (i.e., miR-17~92 cluster), and their downstream effects on VSMC function; and 3) establish the role of ADAMTSs in TSP-1, TSP-2 and TSP-5 activity and in the development of intimal hyperplasia. The methodologies utilized to investigate these Specific Aims include: 1) modified Boyden chamber to assess chemotaxis and colorimetric assay to assess for proliferation in VSMCs; 2) western blot, ELISA and immunoPCR for cell signaling and protein expression; 3) quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction for gene expression; 4) two animal models of intimal hyperplasia ? common carotid artery balloon injury in rats and ligation in mice; 5) use of knockout mice and siRNA for knockdown of TSP and ADAMTS genes in vitro and in vivo to see effects on VSMCs and intimal hyperplasia, respectively; and 6) morphometric analysis, western blot and immunohistochemical staining for analysis of arterial specimens. The siRNA work will also involve testing our novel siRNAs directed at TSP/ADAMTS combinations that may prove to be a highly effective method of blocking intimal hyperplasia at the time of angioplasty. The significance of the proposed research is that the findings will provide a major advance toward identifying new strategies for preventing restenosis due to intimal hyperplasia. The proposed research in this application is innovative, in our opinion, because the findings will define the interactions of multiple TSPs and peptidases with TSP motifs (ADAMTSs) in vascular disease and mechanisms through which these systems can be manipulated with novel siRNAs to improve clinical outcomes. The findings from this application will advance efforts to improve quality of life and longevity by providing safer and more effective therapeutic options for patients with peripheral arterial disease."
"9387457","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Heart failure (HF) affects about 5 million Americans and more Medicare dollars are spent for the diagnosis and treatment of HF than for any other diagnosis. Because ATP is absolutely required to fuel normal contractile function, metabolic strategies to treat HF are an appealing investigative treatment strategy. This application focuses on augmenting depressed metabolism in HF by over-expressing the genes for specific isoforms of creatine kinase, the primary myocardial energy reserve reaction. In the failing heart there is reduced CK activity and a decrease in the myofibrillar (CK-M) and mitochondrial (CK-mito) isoforms. CK-M over-expression in murine HF, induced by thoracic aortic constriction (TAC), was recently shown to significantly improve left ventricular systolic function at rest and with stress and to increase survival, suggesting a critical role for CK energy metabolism in failing hearts. Conversely, even more recent studies suggest that depleting creatine, a substrate for the CK reaction, had no adverse effect on contractile function and survival in the myocardial infarction (MI) model of HF, suggesting no pathophysiologic role for creatine or CK in HF. This application aims to resolve this apparent controversy and to shed new, important insights into the role of CK and creatine in HF. The underlying hypothesis is that dysfunctional, viable myocytes benefit from CK over-expression but models with dense necrosis and cell loss do not. The studies will compare different HF models with and without dense necrosis during separate genetic manipulation of CK expression and creatine content. The proposal will exploit recently created cardiac-specific CK-mito over-expressing mice and noninvasive, serial magnetic resonance spectroscopy and imaging technology to assess the in vivo energetic, contractile, remodeling, and survival consequences in murine HF. The proposed studies aim to answer these timely questions and identify the mechanisms responsible for potential benefit with promise of reducing HF morbidity and mortality."
"9380315","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Alcohol dependence is a devastating psychiatric disorder to individuals and their families, with substantial medical and societal impact. There exists a serious public health need to identify and characterize new and more effective treatments. Chronic alcohol intake leads to long lasting changes in reward- and stress-related neuronal circuitry. The nucleus accumbens (NAc) is an integral component of this circuitry. The stability of behavioral alterations associated with chronic alcohol abuse suggests maladaptive neuroplasticity that is likely achieved through transcriptional mechanisms. Recent clinical trials have revealed that deep brain stimulation of the NAc decreases alcohol craving and relapse in alcohol dependent subjects (Vogues et al., 2012). Much is unknown about the efficacy and mechanisms underlying treatments that alter brain activity. In the proposed studies, I will use DREADDs (designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs) to increase or decrease neuronal activity in the nucleus accumbens and measure alcohol binge drinking (using the limited access paradigm, drinking in the dark) and relapse-like drinking (using chronic intermittent ethanol induction of dependence followed by limited access drinking) behaviors in mice selectively bred to drink intoxicating levels of alcohol in a limited access paradigm. Interestingly, preliminary data reveal that increasing NAc activity decreases binge drinking without altering alcohol reward. Since this is the first time a study such as this has been conducted, it will be essential to determine if these changes in behavior are accompanied by changes in expression of plasticity-related genes and identify DREADD/alcohol responsive gene expression networks using whole transcriptome sequencing (RNA Seq). These findings could have vast implications for alcohol research and treatment."
"9431467","PROJECT SUMMARY  Dr. Kloepfer joined Indiana University School of Medicine (IUSM) as an assistant professor of Pediatrics as a tenure-track research scientist. Shortly after joining the IUSM faculty, she was awarded the departmental K12 Child Health Research Career Development Award from the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development. During her time on the K12, she has: 1) compiled a four member panel to provide mentorship as she works towards independence; 2) established a relationship with IUSM Obstetrics department to recruit from two campus hospitals and multiple outpatient clinics; 3) obtained IRB approval for the proposed study; 4) developed her lab in the Translational Research and Integrated Biology Lab (TRIB) facility housed within the Children?s Clinical Research Center (CCRC); 5) hired a clinical study coordinator and laboratory technician ; 6) established a collaboration with Dr. Douglas Rusch, an informatics expert in the Center for Genomics and Bioinformatics (CGB), an Indiana Clinical and Translational Sciences Institute (ICTSI) core; 7) successfully recruited 63 newborns for the proposed study; and 8) presented abstracts detailing preliminary data included in the attached proposal at the May 2015 and 2016 American Thoracic Society (ATS) meeting.  During fellowship, Dr. Kloepfer became interested in the influence of airway bacteria on airway development. Dr. Kloepfer?s preliminary data demonstrates that decreased bacterial diversity in the airway at three months of age is associated with increased expression of IL-33 and IL-5, and wheeze by six months of age, suggesting that decreased bacterial diversity, cytokine changes and lung function changes occur prior to 3 months of age. 16S rRNA sequencing has not been utilized to prospectively follow newborns with sampling starting at birth. Because the prevalence of asthma continues to increase every year (currently 10% of the population), the etiology of asthma development needs further delineation, particularly in the developing airway prior to an asthma diagnosis. Therefore, to address the above questions, the attached proposal is designed to investigate if airway dysbiosis precedes, coincides with, or follows changes in airway cytokines and lung function in children who develop wheeze.  This project was developed to align with Dr. Kloepfer?s long-term research goals. They include: determining how bacterial metabolites produced from the bacteria identified in the attached study cause airway inflammation; and translating this research into clinically relevant prevention and intervention strategies for children who develop recurrent wheeze and asthma. As we enter the era of personalized medicine, the influence of bacteria on immune development and airway function must be elucidated before methods of prevention and treatment can be prescribed and/or designed."
"9606158","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Disruption of the intestinal epithelial barrier is a crucial manifestation of gastrointestinal disorders including inflammatory bowel disease, celiac disease, and infectious colitis. Integrity of the epithelial barrier is mediated by specialized adhesive structures known as tight junctions (TJ) and adherens junctions (AJ). Evidence suggests that AJ and TJ become disassembled in inflamed intestinal mucosa creating a leakiness of the gut barrier. Understanding mechanisms that regulate junctional integrity in healthy gut and drive AJ/TJ disassembly during mucosal inflammation is the major goal of the proposed study. Integrity and remodeling of TJ and AJ depend on the actomyosin cytoskeleton composed of actin filaments and a specialized motor protein non-muscle myosin (NM) II. NM II works as a molecular ensemble of different heavy chains and light chains. The heavy chains are responsible for all functional activities of this motor including actin binding, ATP hydrolysis and myofilament assembly. Surprisingly, little is known about the role and regulations of NM II heavy chains in normal and inflamed intestinal epithelium. The central innovative hypothesis of this proposal proposes that NM II heavy chains (motors) are critical regulators of the establishment and maintenance of the epithelial barrier in healthy gut and that impaired expression/assembly of these motors results in barrier disruption and inhibited epithelial restitution during mucosal inflammation. This hypothesis will be tested in the following Aims: (1) to determine the roles of different NM II heavy chains in maintenance, disruption, and restitution of the intestinal epithelil barrier in vivo; (2) to investigate the involvement of NM II chaperon, UNC-45A, in the regulation of epithelial barrier integrity and restitution; 3) to analyze the roles of the septin cytoskeletonin NM II assembly and remodeling of the intestinal epithelial barrier. These aims will be accomplished using in vitro intestinal epithelial cells exposed to inflammatory mediators and in vivo using murine models of colitis. The functions of different NM II heavy chains and NM II-targeting chaperons and septins will be analyzed via a combination of functional (permeability measurements, wound healing), biochemical (actin co-sedimentation, immunoblotting, detergent fractionation), immunocytochemical, and genetic (siRNA-mediated knock-downs, dominant-negative mutants, knockout mice) approaches. Significance: the proposed study will yield new insights into fundamental mechanisms that regulate normal epithelial barriers and mediate intestinal mucosal injury and restitution during inflammation. Understanding these mechanisms will provide new therapeutic targets to prevent breakdown and enhance reparation of the gut barrier in patients with digestive diseases."
"9389535","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This K01 Career Development Award will provide Dr. Jennifer Sumner with the necessary skills to establish an independent research career focused on elucidating the psychological and biological mechanisms by which traumatic experiences contribute to cardiovascular disease (CVD) in women, the leading cause of death worldwide. Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), the quintessential stress-related mental disorder, prospectively predicts increased CVD incidence. However, PTSD is a complex and heterogeneous disorder, and the aspects of PTSD that drive CVD risk are unknown. Mechanistic knowledge, particularly in women, is also lacking. These limitations impede the development of clinical applications to offset CVD risk. The overall aim of this K01 proposal is to begin to test a theoretically based biological model by which a core element of PTSD-posttraumatic fear responses (e.g., hypervigilance, re-experiencing)- relates to CVD and intermediate markers of cardiovascular health in women. Supported by a multidisciplinary team of expert mentors, Dr. Sumner will examine how posttraumatic fear responses (measured across self- report and psychophysiological levels of analysis) relate to cardiovascular health in women. The training plan will provide Dr. Sumner with required background and skills in several domains in order to become an independent investigator with an integrative research program on the mechanisms by which the psychological sequelae of trauma contribute to CVD in women. Through coursework, hands-on training, and mentored meetings, Dr. Sumner will address prior gaps in training and develop skills in 1) cardiovascular, neurological, and clinical epidemiology, 2) quantitative methods for analyzing epidemiologic and longitudinal data, 3) CVD- related physiology and biomarkers, and 4) psychophysiological measures of fear responses. The training plan also includes completion of a Master's of Science degree in Patient-Oriented Research from Columbia University. The proposed research program harnesses two richly characterized ongoing cohort studies to test how posttraumatic fear responses relate to cardiovascular risk in women. Using data from the Nurses' Health Study II (NHS II), a longitudinal epidemiologic study of women's health, Dr. Sumner will determine if self- reported posttraumatic fear symptoms relate to hypertension and CVD incidence and CVD-related biomarkers. In the REactions to Acute Care and Hospitalization (REACH) study, a study of risk for PTSD after acute coronary syndrome and its relation to recurrent cardiac events at New York-Presbyterian Hospital, Dr. Sumner will collect data to test associations between fear responses at multiple levels of analysis-self-report symptoms and psychophysiological indicators (i.e., skin conductance and heart rate)-with hospital readmission and cardiac event recurrence. These research and training activities will inform an R01 application that will comprehensively test the biological mechanisms by which posttraumatic fear symptoms across multiple levels of analysis contribute to CVD in women."
"9386761","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal focuses on the mechanisms and electrophysiological consequences of the molecular interactions between the inward rectifier potassium channel protein Kir2.1 and the ?ubunit of the major cardiac sodium channel NaV1.5. Our preliminary results strongly suggest that NaV1.5 and Kir2.1 modulate each other's surface expression and function through their respective PDZ binding domains within a macromolecular complex to control cardiac excitability. Such a dynamic reciprocity is post-translational, involving, at least in part, mutual regulation of trafficking and targeting of both channel proteins at common membrane compartments, as well as internalization. We focus on inheritable mutations that are known to disrupt trafficking of NaV1.5 (Brugada Syndrome, BS) or Kir2.1 (Andersen-Tawil Syndrome, ATS). We surmise that a mutation that disrupts the expression of one channel protein type (e.g., NaV1.5) will also affect the other type (e.g., Kir2.1 by disturbing the common macromolecular complex through which they interact, thus contributing to both the electrophysiological phenotype and arrhythmogenic potential. We will test the following three major hypotheses: 1) NaV1.5 and Kir2.1 protein channels undergo PDZ-domain mediated interactions with common partners in a macromolecular complex that controls their membrane stability; 2) macromolecular complex formation affects anterograde and/or retrograde trafficking of Kir2.1 and NaV1.5; and 3) human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocyte (hiPSC-CMs) expressing either ATS or BS mutations that affect protein trafficking will show reduced excitability reflecting altered expression of both channel proteins, which should contribute strongly to the inherited arrhythmia phenotype. We propose to combine proteomics (e.g., protein purification, yeast two-hybrid assay and interaction domain mapping) and genetic (e.g., mutagenesis and silencing) tools, confocal microscopy, live cell imaging, fluorescence recovery after photobleaching, patch clamping, optical mapping, gene transfer and silencing in heterologous systems, and in single, highly mature ventricular-like hiPSC-CMs and hiPSC-CM monolayers. We will also conduct computer simulations to enable the virtual dissection and interpretation of the electrophysiological and arrhythmogenic changes resulting from NaV1.5-Kir2.1 interactions and their mutants in a macromolecular complex."
"9404048","Project Summary The implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) is the most effective means of detecting and treating arrhythmias, such as ventricular tachycardia (VT) or ventricular fibrillation (VF). However, the main limitation of the current ICD technology is that it aims to terminate an arrhythmia only after the arrhythmia has started. Given that failure, delay or false decision in detecting VT/VF are life-threatening concerns, the next generation of ICD technology should be able to prevent arrhythmias from starting, rather than terminating them after their initiation. Repolarization alternans (RA), a pattern of variation in the shape of electrocardiographic waveform that appears on an every other beat basis, has been associated with increased vulnerability to VT/VF and sudden cardiac death (SCD). In this paradigm shift grant application we propose to investigate the hypothesis that therapy application by an ICD before the abnormal heart rhythm develops will provide a significant improvement not only in preventing SCD, but also in patient acceptance of ICD therapy and quality of life. We have developed a prototype system that can both estimate RA in real-time from intracardiac electrograms and deliver electrical pulses that are timely coupled to cardiac electrical activity. In this proposal we will investigate the applicability of RA-triggered delivery of clinically appropriate electrical therapy to suppress/terminate RA and prevent the development of VT/VF in an animal model of ischemic cardiomyopathy in ambulatory animals. To achieve the aims of this proposal we will (i) determine the efficacy of timely delivered pacing pulses in reducing/suppressing repolarization alternans and preventing the onset of ventricular tachyarrhythmias; (ii) determine whether altered heart rate variability reduces/suppresses repolarization alternans and prevents the onset of ventricular tachyarrhythmias; (iii) determine whether RA-triggered therapy can reduce/suppress repolarization alternans and prevent the onset of ventricular tachyarrhythmias in ambulatory animals."

"9392189","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Microvascular barrier injury represents a significant problem associated with trauma and inflammatory disease. In patients with major burns, edema occurs not only locally but also in tissues remote from the wound, leading to hypovolemic shock and dysfunction of multiple organs including the gut and lungs. The end-organ effects of systemic inflammation have not been well characterized at the cellular or molecular level. The goal of this long- standing project is to elucidate the endothelial-specific mechanisms of microvascular hyperpermeability following burns. Our work during the previous funding period has led to the development of unique experimental models and imaging techniques that enable quantitative analyses of microvascular function in rodent models of thermal injury. The studies also revealed burn-elicited signaling and structural changes in the endothelial barrier characterized by cytoskeleton contraction and cell-cell junction opening. In this competing renewal application, we plan to extend the investigation to a more in-depth examination of endothelial barrier molecules, focusing on our newly discovered pathway of palmitoylation in mediating paracellular permeability. Three specific aims are proposed: 1) to establish the pathophysiological importance and functional role of palmitoylation in burn-induced microvascular injury; 2) to characterize the molecular basis of palmitoylating enzyme (DHHC PAT)-mediated permeability responses in vivo and in vitro; and 3) to identify molecular targets of palmitoylation in endothelial cell-cell adherens junction barrier that regulate microvascular permeability. The central hypothesis to be tested is that endothelial palmitoylation activated following burn injury contributes to the pathogenesis of microvascular barrier failure by promoting ?atenin sequestration from cell-cell junctions, an end-point cellular response attenuated by pharmacological or molecular inhibition of palmitoylation. This novel and mechanistic pathway will be evaluated in a series of complementary studies integrating in vivo microcirculation analyses with isolated microvessel experiments and cultured endothelial cell assays. Innovative experimental models and molecular tools will be developed and tested. Data derived from this project may lead to a new theory about the pathophysiological regulation of microvascular function in trauma. The study also has the potential to identify novel therapeutic or diagnostic targets for inflammatory diseases."
"9390976","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): With advent of HAART, life expectancy for HIV-infected patients has greatly increased, making HIV disease a chronic illness. Consequently, a number of slowly developing side effects of HIV infection are becoming apparent and constitute a significant clinical problem. Many of these co-morbidities, such as cardiovascular disease, dyslipidemia, and metabolic syndrome, are caused by virus- and anti-HIV treatment-mediated impairment of normal metabolism of cholesterol. Importantly, metabolic changes occur not only in HIV-infected cells, which are relatively few in HAART-treated subjects, but also in uninfected cells and tissues. Our studies performed in both in vitro and in vivo models of HIV infection have established that HIV protein Nef released from infected cells impairs activity of cholesterol transporter ABCA1 and interferes with ABCA1-dependent cholesterol efflux in uninfected cells. These effects of extracellular Nef on uninfected tissues may be responsible for metabolic co-morbidities (atherosclerosis, dyslipidemia, diabetes) in HIV-infected patients. However, the mechanism of cholesterol metabolism impairment induced by extracellular Nef and the contribution of this impairment to metabolic complications of HIV infection are not fully understood. This project will address these questions by pursuing the following Specific Aims: 1) To determine how extracellular Nef affects cholesterol metabolism in uninfected cells; 2) To characterize metabolic effects of extracellular Nef; 3) To test the anti-pathogenic effect of drugs targeting cholesterol metabolism. Proposed studies are highly significant as they address pathogenesis of HIV-associated metabolic complications, a leading co-morbidity in HIV disease. This proposal has a significant translational component, as in Aim 3 we will investigate a new therapeutic strategy to treat HIV infection and its metabolic complications using drugs affecting lipid metabolism. The proposal utilizes the expertise of two co-PIs, who have a long history of successful collaboration and complementary expertise in HIV virology (Dr. Bukrinsky) and cholesterol metabolism (Dr. Sviridov)."
"9386767","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Available evidence from pre-clinical and clinical studies indicates that adult autologous stem cell based therapies show modest improvement of cardiac function. Emerging evidence from preclinical studies also suggests that hostile micro-environment in the infarcted myocardium, including inflammation and oxidative damage, have adverse effects on transplanted stem cell survival and function thereby posing a significant barrier to the adult stem cell-based therapies for repair of injured myocardium. Therefore, novel approaches to enhance full functional benefits of stem cell based therapies are critically needed. Pluripotent Stem cells including induced pluripotent stem cells (iPS) and embryonic stem cells (ESCs) have provided an alternative for the resurrection of damaged myocardium yet their use remains technically challenging and risky and cellular derivatives of pluripotent cells may still face the similar challenges of low engraftment and survival as is noted with adult stem cells. Therefore use of cell-free components derived from stem cells including iPS and ES cells, need to be explored for their reparative potential. Exosomes derived from such cells may provide one such cell-free source. Exosomes, known regulators of intercellular communication, carry the cell specific mRNA/miRNA signature and participate in cell-cell communication by transferring their materials to the target cells. Our preliminary data indicates that, ESC derived exosomes represent a novel cell free system capable of supporting myocardial regeneration, in part, by inducing cardiomyocyte proliferation and by enhancing cardiac progenitor cell augmentation, proliferation and differentiation. Therefore we hypothesize that ES/iPS-derived exosomes may represent a novel strategy to augment endogenous repair processes in the infarcted myocardium. Our goal is to establish that pluripotent stem cell-derived exosomes as a novel cell free therapeutic regimen for myocardial repair in response to chronic pathological insult. The significance of this study is to develop a novel understanding of the role played by mES cell derived exosomes in supporting cardiomyocyte and cardiac progenitor cells (CPCs) based reparative processes in the heart. We will also extend these studies to determine the contribution of pluripotent cell specific miRNAs in regulating CPC reparative response to pathologic injury. Establishing the therapeutic value of these exosomes would help develop a novel cell free system to enhance myocardial repair and would provide a new direction for the restoration and/or augmentation of endogenous myocardial repair process."
"9407192","Project Summary/Abstract Recent evidence has demonstrated that up to 30% of children undergoing adenotonsillectomy (AT) for pediatric obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) will have significant residual disease. Although most patients will experience some benefit from AT, the ability to reliably predict the outcome of AT for any individual patient has not been demonstrated. The candidate's long-term goal is to become a leading expert in developing and critically evaluating treatments for pediatric OSAS. To help achieve this goal, the candidate's specific training objectives for this career development award include 1) obtaining advanced biostatistics and outcomes research training, 2) gaining experience in developing and validating a predictive model of surgical outcomes, and 3) developing further clinical expertise in the diagnosis and treatment of pediatric OSAS. These training objectives will be achieved by pursuing advanced biostatistical coursework and training through the Oregon Clinical and Translational Research Institute (OCTRI) Scholars Program as well as clinical and research collaboration with the OHSU Sleep Disorders Program. The overall research objective of this proposal is to develop a comprehensive predictive model for the outcomes of AT for OSAS that includes anatomic and dynamic functional risk factors determined by sleep endoscopy. It is our central hypothesis that a composite predictive model that includes sleep endoscopy findings will accurately predict the outcome of AT and allow estimation of the likelihood of surgical success. The specific aims of this study are to 1) determine the associations between a validated sleep endoscopy rating scale and post AT outcomes, and 2) develop and validate a composite predictive model of the outcomes of AT incorporating sleep endoscopy ratings and other baseline factors. These aims will be achieved through a prospective cohort study of children aged 2-18 years who are undergoing AT for a diagnosis OSAS. Other inclusion criteria will include risk factors predisposing to residual OSAS after AT: obesity, severe preoperative OSAS, African American race, and age greater than 7 years. Patients will undergo sleep endoscopy prior to AT. Outcome measures include apnea-hypopnea index, generic and OSAS-specific quality of life, and validated caregiver ratings of executive function. A composite predictive model using presence of post-AT OSAS as the primary outcome variable will be developed and validated. Such a model will allow more accurate and reliable prognostication of AT outcomes and will help to inform the need for postoperative follow-up and possibly suggest strategies for further intervention."

Using an advantageous mouse model of early life stress that combines postnatal maternal separation and early weaning (MSEW) with a high fat diet, we have identified two potential adipose tissue-derived targets implicated in the pathways by which these mice display exacerbated obesity-induced hypertension. Experimental studies have demonstrated that adipose afferent reflex (AAR) is enhanced in diet-induced obesity models. Specifically, the acute stimulation of adipose tissue afferent nerve fibers (e.g. capsaicin, leptin) elevates blood pressure, renal nerve activity and plasma catecholamines. Adipose tissue also expresses components of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS). Notably, it has been shown that adipose tissue-specific abrogation of the sole RAS precursor, angiotensinogen (AGT), effectively prevents high fat diet-induced increases in blood pressure. Our preliminary findings support for the novel central hypothesis postnatal MSEW aggravates obesity-induced HT in adult life by stimulating AAR reflex-mediated sympathetic activation and adipose tissue-derived AGT secretion. We will test key predictions in two multilevel specific aims: (1) To test the hypothesis that MSEW heightens obesity-induced hypertension by stimulating adipose tissue excitatory signals to increase AAR reflex. We will assess the effects of MSEW on AAR reflex in acute and chronic in vivo experiments using a novel state of the art technique, in order to determine the adipose tissue-brain axis effects on blood pressure; and (2) To test the hypothesis that MSEW exacerbates obesity- induced hypertension by increasing AGT secretion in adipose tissue. We will generate an adipose tissue- specific, tamoxifen-inducible AGT knockout mouse, expose the mice to MSEW and wean them on a high fat diet. The AGT deletion will be induced at three time points from early postnatal life to adulthood, in order to assess its effects on programming, progression and reversion of hypertension. The outcomes of these studies may provide novel early life stress-programmed adipose tissue targets with impact on blood pressure control."

"9392923","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Chronic hypoxia (CH) occurs in many cardiopulmonary diseases and high altitude residency. This common clinical stress causes the remodeling, vasoconstriction and hypertension in the pulmonary artery (PA). These cellular responses primarily result from an increase in intracellular Ca concentration ([Ca2+]i, i.e., Ca2+ signaling) in PA smooth muscle cells (PASMCs). However, the underlying molecular mechanisms are not fully understood, and current therapeutic options for pulmonary hypertension (PH) are limited. Based on our preliminary data and previous publications, we propose a very innovative central hypothesis that CH causes Rieske iron-sulfur protein (RISP)-mediated mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, disrupts FK506 binding protein 12.6 (FKBP12.6)/ryanodine receptor-2 (RyR2) complex, causes RyR2 hyperfunction, increases Ca2+ release, activates calcineurin, cytoplasmic nuclear factor of activated T- cells (NFATc) and nuclear factor-kB (NFkB), and increases cyclin expression in PASMCs, leading to PA remodeling, contraction and hypertension. To test this exciting hypothesis, we will employ complementary, state-of-the-art laser scanning confocal microscopy, patch clamp recording, gene-manipulation, double immunofluorescence staining, florescent resonance energy transfer, and other approaches to address the following fundamental questions (Specific Aims): (1) is the FKBP12.6/RyR2 complex disrupted as a result of RISP-mediated mitochondrial ROS production in PASMCs from mice following CH; (2) does the disruption of the FKBP12.6/RyR2 complex mediate CH-induced PA remodeling, contraction and hypertension; and (3) is the role of FKBP12.6/RyR2 complex disruption in CH-induced responses in PAs mediated by the calcineurin-dependent, NF-kB/NFATc-mediated cyclin signaling axis? We fully believe that the findings from the proposed studies will greatly improve our current knowledge of the cellular molecular mechanisms for PA remodeling, constriction and hypertension, and help to fully understand what and how Ca2+ downstream signaling axis is in hypoxic. It is expected that the results may also aid in the creation of novel, specific and more effective therapeutic targets for the treatment of PAH and other relevant pulmonary vascular diseases, with a great potential for revolutionizing clinical practices."
"9399644","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Augmented intrarenal angiotensinogen (AGT) is a critical contributor to the activation of intrarenal renin- angiotensin system (RAS) which leads to the development of hypertension and associated tissue injury. Therefore, elucidating mechanisms underlying AGT upregulation is essential for the development of strategies to treat these diseases. Chronic Ang II elevation induces increased immune cell infiltration in the kidneys contributing to increase in intrarenal cytokine levels specifically interleukin 6 (IL-6). Notably, IL-6 is required for Ang II-induced AGT augmentation in renal proximal tubular cells (PTC). However, the cellular mechanisms underlying these complex interactions leading to AGT augmentation have not been delineated. Renal cortical AGT levels are lower in female rodents than in males under normal conditions; however, plasma and liver AGT levels do not exhibit this gender disparity, suggesting that kidneys have a unique mechanism inherent to establishing basal AGT levels. Our preliminary studies demonstrated that histone deacetylase 9 (HDAC9) levels are higher in the kidneys of female rats than those of male rats and that HDAC9 inhibitions by siRNA and an inhibitor resulted in augmentation of AGT levels in PTC. These results indicate that HDAC9 is a suppressor of intrarenal AGT expression. Since HDACs suppress gene transcription by histone-deacetylation, changes in HDAC levels alter accessibility of activated transcription factors to their binding sites on gene promoters. The preliminary study showed that HDAC9 levels are decreased by Ang II in PTC. Accordingly, we hypothesize that downregulation of HDAC9 by Ang II reduces the suppressive effects of HDAC9 on AGT expression. This allows other transcription factors activated by pathological stimuli, in particula IL-6, to augment AGT expression, thus leading to the progression of hypertension and associated tissue injury in Ang II-dependent hypertension. To address this hypothesis, we will establish that Ang II suppresses intrarenal HDAC9 levels during the development of Ang II-dependent hypertension using unique PTC and Ang II- dependent hypertensive animal models (Specific Aim 1). In addition, the proposed studies will demonstrate that Ang II-induced intrarenal HDAC9 downregulation is required for intrarenal AGT augmentation by synergistic effects of Ang II and IL-6 and consequent development of hypertension (Specific Aim 2). In these experiments, HDAC9 knockdown by siRNA and overexpression via AAV2 infection will be used to show that the HDAC9 knockdown and IL-6 synergistically augment AGT expression in PTC and that kidney-specific HDAC9 overexpression attenuates intrarenal AGT elevation facilitating consequent the development of kidney injury in Ang II-dependent hypertension. Gender differences of intrarenal HDAC9 regulation and its contribution to AGT regulation in hypertension will also be investigated in the projects. The results will establish the cardinal rol of intrarenal HDAC9 in the regulation of intrarenal AGT in Ang II-dependent hypertension and provide a mechanistic rationale for targeting HDAC9 to treat hypertension and RAS associated tissue injury."
"9393833","ABSTRACT  In this component we test hypotheses about the social ecological correlates of heavy drinking and alcohol use disorders (AUDs). We know little about the many problems that may be related to AUDs per se, and we know nothing about the community contexts that may accelerate or mitigate AUD-related problems, the critical social ecological question considered here. We propose to: Specific Aim 1: Develop and test a dynamic model of relationships between drinking, problems and AUD symptoms, Specific Aim 2: Use this model to assess ways in which drinking contexts and situations differentially affect problems  among AUD vs. non-AUD drinkers, and Specific Aim 3: Begin to measure broader impacts that AUDs have on alcohol problems across communities in the US.  We develop a mathematical model that summarizes dynamic relationships between drinking, problems and AUD symptoms. That model is used to predict and test statistical relationships between measures of these constructs using general population survey data from 3000 adult respondents 18 years of age and older in California. AUD symptoms are measured using items from the World Mental Health Organization Composite International Diagnostic Interview.  A subsample of about 267 AUD and 534 non-AUD drinkers will be drawn from the population survey, matched by drinking pattern, gender and age, then administered three web-based surveys at 6-month intervals, including additional measures of use in drinking contexts, routine daily drinking activities and social network supports for drinking. Critically, the model developed in Specific Aim 1 enables us to make unbiased comparisons between groups.  In order to characterize public health problems related to AUDs at the community level we assess spatial statistical relationships between AUD-related hospital discharge diagnoses (HDDs) and a spectrum of alcohol-related problems across ZIP codes in California and other states in the US. These analyses also provide support for two other research components of the Center: the assessment of impacts of Mexican border access to alcohol on AUD-related HDDs among young adult Hispanic drinkers (Component #4) and, in combination with other survey data generated in this component, the parameterization of simulation models of alcohol problems in cities in the state and, as possible, across the nation (Component #5).  With our short-term goals of understanding and estimating the impacts of AUD on alcohol problems achieved, we can take on the long-term goal of providing communities with essential information on how prevention policies can be used effectively to reduce problems related to AUDs in their communities."
"9390953","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Asthma is the most common chronic disease for youth in industrialized countries. Despite advances in medical treatments, the prevalence of asthma in youth continues to rise, resulting in a significant burden on society in terms of financial costs and lost productivity due to missed school days. Thus, there is a need to identify modifiable health behaviors, such as sleep duration, that may reduce the frequency and severity of asthma exacerbations. Chronic partial sleep restriction (routinely sleeping less than required for optimal functioning) is common among adolescents, including youth with asthma, and is often behaviorally induced. Growing evidence has shown that chronic partial sleep restriction contributes to disease development and poorer health outcomes. For adolescents with asthma, chronic partial sleep restriction may result in poorer lung function and functional outcomes. Therefore, increased sleep duration may provide a novel, effective, low-cost intervention for the clinical management of asthma in adolescents. This project brings together investigators with substantial expertise in pediatric sleep, asthma, and immunology and will enroll 86 adolescents (ages 12-17 years) with asthma to participate in an established sleep manipulation protocol. Following a week of baseline sleep stabilization, adolescents with asthma will participate in a randomized, counterbalanced design that includes two experimentally manipulated weeks of sleep duration - one week of a deficient sleep opportunity (6.5 hours in bed per night) and one week of a healthy sleep opportunity (10 hours in bed per night). Subjects will complete both objective and subjective daily measures of sleep (actigraphy, sleep diary), as well as asthma control and lung function (electronic peak expiratory flow, asthma diary). Additional measures of lung function (spirometry), asthma control, health related quality of life, and inflammation (exhaled nitric oxide, serum cytokines) will be collected at the end of each study week. The aim of this study is to examine the impact of chronic partial sleep restriction vs. healthy sleep opportunity on lung function and functional outcomes in adolescents with asthma. An exploratory aim will examine the impact of chronic partial sleep restriction vs. healthy sleep opportunity on biomarkers of inflammation in adolescents with asthma. The proposed study would be the first to use an experimental manipulation of sleep duration in adolescents with asthma, and allows our team of pediatric experts to examine the causal impact of sleep duration on lung function and functional outcomes. In addition, this study will utilize objective measures of sleep duration, lung function, and inflammation (rather than relying on self-report measures), as well as standardized outcome measures of asthma control and health related quality of life. Finally, the protocol design closely mimics the chronic partial sleep deficiency experienced by many adolescents on school nights, promoting confidence that the findings will have real-world relevance and applicability in the clinical care for adolescents with asthma."
"9414846","Depression is present in about 20-30% of hemodialysis patients and is associated with morbidity and mortality. However, depression is inadequately diagnosed and treated among dialysis patients. This is due in part to the overlap between depressive symptoms (e.g. appetite change, trouble sleeping, feeling tired) and symptoms related to persistent metabolic derangements in hemodialysis patients (e.g. nausea, nocturnal cramps, feeling washed out after treatment). The overlap between depressive symptoms and dialysis-related complications makes it difficult to diagnose and therefore to treat depression. In addition, prescription of antidepressant medication may increase an already high pill burden and result in poor adherence. Moreover, the evidence base to guide depression treatment among hemodialysis patients is limited. In our previous work, we developed methods to use latent variables and structural equation modeling to isolate depressive symptoms. Other investigators have demonstrated that directly observed treatment enhances the effectiveness of tuberculosis and HIV treatment. We now propose a cross-sectional study followed by a randomized controlled trial at 17 dialysis facilities. The cross-sectional study will involve assessments of depressive symptoms (using the PHQ-9 screening instrument) as well as dialysis-related complications. We will then use structural equation modeling to develop and validate a hemodialysis-specific PHQ-9 (hdPHQ-9) that will isolate depressive symptoms. The trial will involve 216 patients with confirmed depression who will be randomly assigned to (a) directly observed weekly antidepressant treatment with fluoxetine or (b) referral to their nephrologists, their primary care physicians, or nearby mental health providers. The primary outcome of the trial will be remission of depression at 12 weeks. The trial results will also be used to compare the responsiveness of the PHQ-9 and the hdPHQ-9. We anticipate that the hdPHQ-9 will be a valid and responsive instrument that will isolate depressive symptoms in hemodialysis patients and ultimately improve the screening and diagnosis of depression. We also expect that directly observed weekly fluoxetine treatment will be an effective way to manage depression among hemodialysis patients. Innovative features of the proposed project include the use of latent variables to address overlap, administration of a long acting weekly antidepressant, directly observed treatment, and a rigorous randomized controlled trial design. The project has the potential not only to improve the diagnosis and management of depression among hemodialysis patients but also to improve their morbidity and mortality. Furthermore, it may serve as a model for future studies to isolate symptoms among overlapping medical conditions."
"9387468","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The demand for donor hearts for transplantation far outstrips the supply; however, only one in three available cardiac grafts are used for transplantation. There are many reasons for graft non-use, but previous studies have failed to demonstrate consistent associations between donor characteristics, donor cardiac function, and adverse recipient outcomes. Thus, there is a critical need to standardize how cardiac allografts are evaluated and accepted for transplantation. Our long-term goal is to safely expand the use of available cardiac allografts without adversely affecting transplant recipient outcomes. We propose to carefully characterize the current population of cardiac organ donors, particularly with regards to allograft function; to examine how decisions are made regarding graft acceptance for transplantation; and to systematically evaluate associations between donor characteristics and recipient outcomes. Our central hypothesis is that acceptable allografts for heart transplantation are being unnecessarily discarded, and the establishment of an evidence-based process for cardiac donor evaluation and acceptance will increase graft utilization rates while maintaining excellent clinical outcomes. In response to this need, we propose a collaborative study with seven organ procurement organizations representing geographically diverse regions of the United States, to address the following specific aims: (1) To identify clinical correlates of graft function in potential donors being evaluated for heart transplantation An existing online donor research database will be expanded for standardized collection of data on detailed donor characteristics, especially as pertains to cardiac allograft function. We will perform expert core review of donor echocardiograms, including serial echocardiograms in donors with cardiac allograft dysfunction. Serial electrocardiograms and cardiac biomarkers (Troponin I and B-type natriuretic peptide) will also be studied; (2) To prospectively study reasons for cardiac allograft non-utilization for heart transplantation. Real-time data will be collected on specific reasons for allograft non-acceptance for transplantation in order to study graft acceptance practices and variation in graft utilization nationwide; and (3) To prospectively study associations between donor characteristics and recipient outcomes after heart transplantation. Data will be collected on recipient post-transplant length of hospitalization and survival to identify associations between donor predictors and recipient outcomes. This proposal is innovative because it focuses on an entirely different approach to donor-based research, thereby surmounting the limitations of prior investigations. Completion of the proposed study will have a positive impact by defining how to optimize the evaluation and use of available grafts for heart transplantation, thereby safely expanding the donor pool and increasing the number of heart transplants performed nationwide."
"9448508","ABSTRACT The main goal of this project is to dissect gene regulatory functions of Tet enzymes in ESCs, and define the significance of noncanonical (non-enzymatic) roles of these proteins in gene repression and in stem cell biology. The Ten-eleven-translocation (Tet) enzymes (Tet1, Tet2, Tet3) regulate gene expression program in ESCs and during development. They facilitate DNA demethylation by oxidizing 5-methylcytosine (5mC) to 5- hydroxymethylcytosine and other derivatives. The enzymatic function of Tet enzymes in DNA demethylation and its significance in ESCs and development has been well investigated as part of my prior work in the field. However, recent findings from my lab strongly suggest that key biological roles of Tet proteins are independent of their catalytic activity. We have found that more genes are differentially expressed in Tet1 knockout ESCs than in Tet1 catalytic mutant ESCs (vs. wild type ESCs). Majority of these genes are overexpressed, suggesting that noncatalytic functions of Tet enzymes regulate gene repression in ESCs and contribute to their biology. Consistently, we found that catalytically inactive Tet enzymes rescued some of the phenotypes of Tet deficient ESCs. These observations build the initial premise for this project. We hypothesize that in addition to their DNA demethylase activity, Tet enzymes regulate the epigenome independent of their enzymatic activity. This involves targeting gene regulatory elements to recruit chromatin repressive complexes for proper gene repression. This constitutes a novel layer of epigenetic regulation that influences key features of ESC biology including proliferation, pluripotency and lineage specification. Using a recently developed platform in my lab that consists of Tet catalytic mutant and knockout ESCs, we will apply molecular, cellular and developmental approaches to dissect the catalytic dependent and independent requirements of Tet enzymes in stem cells, and establish the significance of noncanonical roles of Tet enzymes in ESC biology. We propose the following three aims: (1) we will define gene regulatory elements targeted by noncanonical functions of Tet enzymes and map the noncatalytic Tet domains required for their regulation. (2) We will establish the noncanonical roles of Tet enzymes in recruiting chromatin repressive complexes to gene regulatory elements for gene silencing. (3) We will define the biological relevance of Tet-mediated noncanonical gene repression in ESC proliferation, pluripotency and endodermal differentiation. Our findings will reveal novel epigenetic mechanisms of regulation of ESCs by Tet enzymes. This will enhance our understanding of the epigenetic networks in stem cells and will open future opportunities for investigating Tet-mediated gene regulation during development and in diseases."
"9542943","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Persistence of a herpesvirus - in both the host and population - requires a balance between latent and lytic phases. This balance is also important for herpesvirus-mediated pathogenesis, including EBV-related diseases. EBV provides a powerful system for studying human herpesvirus latency (and lytic activation), due to its ability to establish latency in vitro. While latent EBV can be (re-)activated into the lytic phase by chemicals or immunoglobulin crosslinking, not every EBV-infected B cell is susceptible to lytic activation. This refractory state, while crucial for viral persistence, negatively impacts success f viral oncolytic therapy for EBV-cancers. Unfortunately, determinants of susceptibility to lytic activation signals are poorly understood. To address this critical issue at the single cell level, e pioneered a method for separating lytic and refractory B cells, and made the fundamental discovery that cellular STAT3, a transcription factor overactive in many human cancers, regulates susceptibility to lytic activation. We propose to test the hypothesis that STAT3 does this by employing cellular DNA-binding protein SZF1 to recruit the transcriptional co-repressor KAP1 to simultaneously repress multiple EBV lytic genes, thereby promoting the refractory state. In Aim 1, we will identify and validate SZF1-binding sites on the EBV genome in infected cells, using ChIP-exo to achieve single nucleotide resolution. In Aim 2, we will elucidate the mechanism of SZF1-mediated transcriptional repression of EBV lytic genes - using STAT3, SZF1, and KAP1 mutants, as well as purified lytic and refractory cells. The proposed research is expected to significantly impact our understanding of 1) how 2 major host transcriptional mechanisms (mediated via STAT3 and KAP1) regulate expression of EBV lytic genes to affect susceptibility to lytic activation, and thereby viral persistence, 2) how STAT3, SZF1, and KAP1 function may be exogenously manipulated to increase the number of lytic cells, and 3) how KAP1 repressor identifies targets in a genomic context - promoting discovery of cellular targets and physiologic functions of SZF1. Importantly, by providing tools to devise approaches (e.g., small molecules) to enhance lytic activation, our work promises to cripple viral persistence, and improve effectiveness of therapies for EBV-associated cancers."

Jonathan Smith, Ph.D., Core Leader Project Summary/Abstract The Lipoprotein analysis portion of this Core's primary objective is to analyze lipid and lipoprotein levels in various mouse models produced by projects and to provide human lipoproteins as needed. Mouse lipoprotein analysis will be accomplished using two methods, one based on separation of HDL-C from non-HDL-C via ultracentrifugation or precipitation, and the other based on size exclusion chromatography by FPLC. The Atherosclerosis portion of this Core's primary objective is to train investigators how to sacrifice mice and prepare tissues for atherosclerosis assays, and to offer two separate quantitative atherosclerosis assays; 1) cross sectional lesion area at the aortic root, and 2) cross sectional brachiocephalic lesion area. We can also assist Project personnel by teaching them the assay of surface lesion area on en face preparations of the entire aorta. Standardization of the lipoprotein assays and atherosclerosis assays will facilitate inter-laboratory collaboration and data comparisons. In addition, the Core will relieve the individual laboratories from having to learn and perform the laborious assays for atherosclerosis quantification."
"9463189","Project Summary / Abstract The University of Michigan Child Health Research Career Development Award (CHRCDA) program is designed to support the career development of junior pediatric investigators. CHRCDA scholars participate in an intensive, mentored training program in cell and molecular biology as well as a didactic educational program designed to ensure their continued research development. Since its launch in 1992, the Michigan CHRCDA has contributed to the training of nearly 50 pediatrician-scientists, the majority of whom have obtained R-level NIH funding for the study of childhood diseases. The Aims of this renewal application are to:  1) Recruit the most promising junior pediatrician-scientists for training, including those from diverse backgrounds. In order to broaden the scope, reach and diversity of our pediatrician-scientist ?pipeline,? we now plan to undertake a regional collaboration with the Children's Hospital of Michigan, an affiliate of Wayne State University School of Medicine in Detroit.  2) Enhance the translational research training of pediatrician-scientists. It is essential for scholars to participate in translational research teams bringing together physicians, bench scientists, statisticians, patent experts, and more. To accomplish this goal, we plan to leverage the resources of the Michigan Institute for Clinical and Health Research (MICHR, home of the University of Michigan CTSA), and  3) Recognize that many pediatric diseases are more common in underserved populations and arise in part from dietary and environmental exposures. Childhood obesity and exposure to lead and other environmental toxins are important contributors to disease in Michigan children. To address this need, we plan to further extend our mentor base from the University of Michigan Department of Pediatrics to other Departments and Schools, including the University of Michigan School of Public Health and the Wayne State University Institute of Environmental Health Sciences.  To achieve these Aims, the Program Director, Dr. Opipari, and Co-Training Directors, Drs. Hershenson and Lipshultz, will be assisted by 1) a Scientific Advisory Committee to oversee program direction and scholar selection and evaluation; 2) an External Advisory Board to provide an independent review of the program; 3) an Education Core to oversee scholar didactic training; 4) two Recruitment Officers to assist in identification and recruitment of minority candidates; and 5) National Program Reviewers who will be invited to campus to perform an annual review of the program and assess the progress of the UM CHRCDA Scholars.  Finally, due to the urgent need to train pediatrician-scientists, the University of Michigan Medical School Dean's Office and the Department of Pediatrics and Communicable Diseases has agreed to supply matching funds for one additional Scholar per year for the five-year term of the award."
"9392207","Frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD), a common cause of early-onset dementia, encompasses a group of disorders with significant genetic, clinical and neuropathological heterogeneity. Understanding the diverse underlying mechanisms of FTLD pathogenesis is a fundamental area of interest of my research program. To accelerate scientific discovery, we have adopted a comprehensive approach that investigates multiple FTLD mechanisms driven by key molecular players (e.g., TDP-43, progranulin, and tau). We also place great emphasis on translational research geared towards identifying much needed biomarkers and therapies, an area of particular importance given that there exists no treatment for FTLD. Our endeavors to uncover the pathomechanisms associated with TDP-43, tau and FTLD-causing mutations have yielded seminal findings published in high-impact journals. For instance, in the five years since the discovery of the G4C2 repeat expansions in C9ORF72 as the most common known cause of FTLD, my group identified a new neuropathological hallmark specific to this mutation, namely the accumulation of proteins of repeating dipeptides synthesized from the expansion; made significant strides in elucidating mechanisms of disease relating to these so-called c9RAN proteins; identified promising therapeutic strategies and potential biomarkers for C9ORF72 repeat expansion carriers; and developed the first mouse model to recapitulate both neuropathological and clinical features of patients. Our productivity is influenced by the excellent research environment fostered at Mayo Clinic, which brings together highly interactive and devoted neurobiologists, geneticists, neuropathologists and physician scientists, as well as the numerous collaborations we have forged with world-renowned experts in the field. Herein, we propose to extend our discoveries by addressing impactful questions, some of which may be high risk, but all with clear potential to be transformative to the field. Of importance, the nature of the R35 mechanism will allow us the flexibility to explore intriguing new directions that emerge from our findings and those of others, ensuring that our studies remain timely and relevant. Overall, with the goal of advancing our understanding and developing therapies for FTLD, we propose mechanistic and translational investigations relating to three main areas: 1) C9ORF72-linked FTLD-TDP; 2) GRN-linked FTLD-TDP; and 3) FTLD-Tau. We will explore various therapeutic approaches, seek to identify disease-relevant biomarkers in cerebrospinal fluid and blood, and develop and improve FTLD animal models."
"9392194","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Ca2+ controls cardiac function by acting as the primary regulator of the sarcomeric contractile machinery and as a second messenger in the signal transduction pathways that control cardiac growth, metabolism and pathological remodeling. Ca2+ handling in striated muscle is tightly regulated by Ca2+ pumps in the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) and plasma membranes that maintain intracellular Ca2+ levels ~10,000-fold lower than extracellular and SR concentrations. Ca2+ release from the SR membrane transiently increases Ca2+ levels in the cytosol, triggering actomyosin cross-bridge formation within the sarcomere to generate contractile force. Reuptake of Ca2+ into the SR by sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA) is necessary for muscle relaxation and restores SR Ca2+ levels for subsequent contraction-relaxation cycles. SERCA thus serves as a central regulator of cardiac function, as well as the pathogenic signaling cascades that drive heart disease. The activity of SERCA in the heart is modulated by phospholamban (PLN), a tiny peptide that interacts with SERCA in the SR membrane and diminishes Ca2+ pump activity. Recently, we discovered that a cardiac- specific RNA annotated as a long noncoding RNA actually encodes a previously unrecognized micropeptide, which we named DWORF (Dwarf Open Reading Frame). DWORF is localized to the SR of cardiomyocytes and interacts with SERCA. DWORF is among the most dramatically down-regulated proteins in failing hearts, pointing to its potential involvement in the response of the heart to stress and contractile dysfunction. The overall goals of this project are to define the functions of DWORF and to decipher the mechanisms that govern its expression in normal and diseased hearts. Manipulation of the activity of this novel micropeptide represents a potential strategy to enhance cardiac contractility in the setting of heart disease. The discovery of DWORF also provides a new inroad into our understanding of the signaling mechanisms involved in the control of cardiac function and suggests a previously unrecognized role for micropeptides in the control of cardiac physiology and pathology."

"9391708","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Atherosclerosis and its major clinical manifestation, coronary artery disease (CAD), is the leading cause of death in the western world. Preventive strategies currently focus on controlling risk factors and lipid levels. Substantial residual risk remains high, even when treatment goals are fully met. In humans, monocytes that infiltrate the plaque differentiate into inflammatory macrophages produce proteolytic enzymes that digest extracellular matrix causing plaque rupture. Plaque inflammation is therefore pursued as a therapeutic target to lower the recurrent rates of atherothrombotic events. Nanomedicine offers exciting new possibilities for the treatment of a variety of pathologies by improving the pharmacokinetics and biodistribution of therapeutic agents, while simultaneously decreasing adverse effects and undesired interactions. In the field of atherosclerosis, nanomedicine is still in its infancy, but is expected to provide potentially revolutionary advances in treatment for the most challenging aspects of cardiovascular diseases. Since nanomedicine remains relatively unexplored for atherosclerosis, novel-imaging strategies that allow characterizing this disease, but also allow the quantitative visualization of nanoparticle targeting and efficacy need to be developed. In this project, we propose to develop and utilize PET/MRI technology for the imaging-based evaluation of nanotherapy for the treatment of atherosclerotic plaque inflammation. To that aim, in collaboration with radiochemists at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, we have developed 89Zr radioisotope labeling methods for liposomal nanoparticles (LNPs) and high-density lipoprotein (HDL). We will evaluate the nanoreporter technology in a rabbit model of atherosclerosis. Extensive ex vivo imaging and histological techniques will be applied to evaluate the in vivo findings and to unravel the mechanism of action. The specific aims are: Aim 1: To establish the biodistribution and plaque targeting of liposomal nanoparticles of which only a small fraction is labeled with 89Zr. To quantitatively evaluate plaque macrophage targeting and biodistribution of 89Zr-labeled HDL. : To theranostically evaluate the efficacy Aim 2 Aim 3 of 89Zr-labeled and drug-loaded LNPs in atherosclerotic rabbits by PET/MRI. Translation to the clinic is facilitated by the fact that the individual components of all the proposed nanoparticle formulations and the labeling methods are FDA approved. Finally, using nanoparticle formulations to rapidly inhibit vessel wall inflammation and develop imaging technology to monitor their efficacy may have a profound impact on the management of cardiovascular diseases."

The Scholarly Concentrations Program is an elective course of study that provides students with the opportunity to complete substantial scholarly work in a particular area of study during the entirety of the four year medical school continuum. Most importantly, this program provides a 3-year longitudinal mentoring experience with Brown University faculty. It is anticipated that the involvement of AMSSRP participants in the summer research experience, involvement in the Scholarly Concentrations Program, and mentorship by Brown University faculty will increase the students' commitment to and preparation for a career in academic medicine. NIH has consistently made translational and 'bench-to-bedside' research a priority. However, the increase in NIH support of biomedical basic research has not correlated with an increase in the discovery of efficacious therapies or diagnostics to battle human diseases. This disparity is thought to be due in part to the decrease in the number of physicians that have pursued a research career, a decline that may result from a lack of mentorship, rising costs of medical school education, and a perception that physician scientists are not as highly regarded as physicians in the hospital setting. The AMSSRP serves to dispel this trend by partnering medical students with successful and active scientist mentors engaged in cutting edge research and exposing them to the excitement of biomedical research discoveries related to cardiovascular, pulmonary and blood health and diseases."
"9393260","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The pyramidal cell microcircuits of the primate dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) are gravely afflicted in schizophrenia. Research in monkeys has shown that these circuits excite each other through glutamatergic, NMDA receptor (NMDAR) synapses on dendritic spines to generate the persistent neural representations needed for working memory. Immunoelectron microscopy has revealed that both nicotinic-?7 receptors (nic- ?7R), and muscarinic M1 receptors (M1R) are localized in dlPFC glutamate synapses within the post-synaptic density (PSD). During the previous tenure of this grant, we discovered that cholinergic stimulation of nic-?7R enhances neural representations in the primate dlPFC, and is permissive for NMDAR actions, rescuing neuronal firing from NMDAR blockade. As schizophrenia is associated with impaired NMDAR and nic-?7R signaling, these data encourage the development of nic-?7R agonists for the treatment of PFC cognitive deficits. However, this strategy has been hampered by the rapid desensitization of nic-?7R following stimulation, and by drug actions at peripheral nic-?7R. Thus, additional approaches are needed. Stimulation of M1R may have beneficial effects on dlPFC function similar to nic-?7R, and may provide a more tractable target since they are concentrated in brain areas relevant to cognition but are not as prevalent in the peripheral nervous system. As schizophrenia is associated with changes in the M1R gene (CHRM1) and with reduced M1R expression in dlPFC, these data have direct relevance to the etiology and treatment of this disease. In the proposed research, Aim 1 will examine whether stimulation of M1R, like nic-?7R, enhances the firing of dlPFC neurons in monkeys performing a working memory task, and whether M1R stimulation is permissive for NMDAR actions as suggested by their synaptic localization. We will also have the opportunity to test a novel, highly selective M1R positive allosteric modulator (PAM) created by Dr. Jeffrey Conn's Drug Discovery group at Vanderbilt University to see if this compound can enhance dlPFC neuronal firing and improve working memory following systemic administration in monkeys. Aim 2 will address the mechanism of M1R actions in dlPFC, examining the hypothesis that M1R act by closing KCNQ potassium channels (Kv7; also known as M channels), which are also localized within the PSD of layer III glutamate synapses, positioned to depolarize the synaptic membrane and facilitate NMDAR signaling when closed by M1R actions. Finally, Aim 3 will test whether the same neurons that respond to nic-?7R stimulation also respond to M1R, and if so, whether they have additive or synergistic interactions. Additive or synergistic actions of nic-?7R and M1R stimulation could lead to combined treatments that allow lower doses with fewer side effects, circumventing a major hurdle in the development of cholinergic therapeutics for cognitive disorders."
"9393694","SUMMARY The neurobiological mechanisms controlling the transition from alcohol use to abuse are poorly understood. Our overall approach is to examine vulnerable populations to highlight specific cellular/molecular pathways involved in this transition. For example, human adolescents exposed to heavy alcohol use are at much greater risk for the development of alcoholism as adults. Recent studies suggest similar liabilities for adolescent animals including rodents. Our published work indicates adolescent chronic ethanol exposure differentially modulates both glutamatergic and GABAergic neurotransmission in the lateral/basolateral amygdala (BLA), a `node' within circuits critical for the integration cognitive and sensory information during emotional responses, in an input-specific fashion. Our data also suggest a critical role for mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)- dependent signaling cascades in synaptic strengthening. Further, we provide preliminary data suggesting that many of these synaptic effects are absent or greatly diminished in adult animals. This suggests that mTOR- dependent signaling directly regulates synaptic modulation during adolescent ethanol exposure. The overall goal of the current project is to therefore use a well-established ethanol vapor exposure in adolescent rats to understand the long-term impact of this exposure in adult animals by integrating cellular, molecular, and behavioral methodologies. The proposed work includes three specific aims: Aim 1 will characterize the effects of adolescent ethanol exposure on adult BLA glutamatergic and GABAergic neurotransmission using whole- cell patch clamp electrophysiology; Aim 2 will describe the effect of adolescent ethanol exposure on mTOR signaling in both postsynaptic and presynaptic compartments in the BLA; and, Aim 3 will examine pharmacological intervention along the mTOR-signaling pathway and its impact on the long-term behavioral consequences of adolescent ethanol exposure. Together these aims are significant because they leverage a vulnerable population (adolescents), innovative technical and conceptual approaches, and the substantial expertise of our research team to help identify specific cellular signaling processes governing the impact of ethanol exposure across multiple levels of analysis. We will directly test if these signaling processes represent potential therapeutic targets for treatments designed to interrupt the transition from ethanol use to abuse."

"9395915","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  In May 2005, the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) established the Collaborative Pediatric Critical Care Research Network (CPCCRN) to support multi-institutional randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies in critically ill children, and the network was competitively renewed in 2009. The CPCCRN currently consists of seven core Clinical Centers, and the Data Coordinating Center (DCC). Since it was established nine years ago, the CPCCRN and its investigators have considered 61 research concepts, created a network registry, implemented 23 studies (including the NHLBI-funded Therapeutic Hypothermia after Pediatric Cardiac Arrest (THAPCA) Trials), published 39 peer-reviewed publications, and produced seven public use datasets that are freely available to enable research by additional investigators. Going forward, in addition to the network registry and the THAPCA Trials, CPCCRN has five on-going studies that are anticipated to continue through at least early 2016. These include observational studies of the complications of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) and hemodynamic analyses of cardiopulmonary resuscitation in the intensive care unit, a pharmacometric evaluation of antibiotics during ECMO, and two R01-funded sepsis studies.  The University of Utah has been the DCC since network inception, and proposes to continue in this role during the next five years. The DCC faculty bring recognized clinical, biostatistical and informatics expertise to the CPCCRN. This proposal has three specific aims. Specific Aim 1. Provide clinical and biostatistical leadership and expertise, assistance in study and protocol design, study implementation and management, tracking and delivery methods for study drugs and biological specimens, study training, data collection and management, site monitoring, study reporting, interim and final study analyses, publication of study results, and production of public use research datasets. Specific Aim 2. Provide logistical support for CPCCRN (including financial management of protocol funds), using advanced communication and informatics tools for development and tracking of critical documents, including study protocols, FAQ documents, Manuals of Operation, training materials, IRB and other regulatory documents, study publications, DSMB reports, and provision of accounting information to NICHD. Specific Aim 3. Improve efficiency of studies by continuing the voluntary CPCCRN central IRB and refining methods for direct data collection from CPCCRN electronic health records."
"9464228","PROJECT SUMMARY Collaborative Drug Discovery, Inc. (CDD) proposes to extend its innovative software platform ? BioAssay Express (BAE, version 1.0) ? which helps biologists to quickly and easily encode their plain-text biological assay protocols into formats suitable for computational processing. In Phase 2B, CDD will further enhance BAE so that it can markup a bioassay with a comprehensive, detailed set of annotations that completely specifies the protocol, step by step. In its current state of development in Phase 2, BAE 1.0 enables scientists to summarize the English language text that specifies an experimental protocol, supplementing it with machine-interpretable descriptors. At the end of Phase 2B, BAE 2.0 will output a detailed machine- interpretable version that will be completely equivalent to, and can optionally substitute for, the traditional English language method description. The enhanced BAE 2.0 software will enable scientists engaged in early stage drug discovery to efficiently and accurately document experimental procedures and intelligently aggregate datasets across research groups. An important benefit will be facilitating improved access, use and reproducibility by (1) flagging differences between closely related assays; (2) correlating differences in protocols with differences in results; and (3) improving the reproducibility of experiments conducted in different laboratories, to highlight potential causes of divergences. The project will continue to leverage the related broad initiatives at NIH and elsewhere that are working to promote translational research, gather screening data via open repositories, and apply sophisticated ontologies to classify these datasets. Our project targets the intersection of these disparate initiatives and unifies them by making their complex standards and guidelines for praxis realistically accessible to researchers who want to focus on their scientific work To encourage adoption, the software will prioritize intuitive ease of use by scientists who are not informatics experts, harmonize with existing laboratory workflows, minimize the extra effort of annotation, integrate seamlessly into preclinical data management platforms (including but not limited to CDD?s own CDD Vault), and deliver clear and immediate benefits to the user as part of an integrated experience. This combination of new capabilities and extreme ease of use will accelerate translational drug discovery efforts by empowering software platforms that bridge the divide between biologists and medicinal chemists to apply sophisticated tools ? long available on the chemistry side ? for the first time also to the biological side, and thus across both domains. Existing software can already easily connect screening results to chemical structures. This new platform will further connect these data to the purpose and methodology of the screens."
"9385717","Project 1 (P1). Signaling mechanisms of toll-like and interleukin-1 receptors in inflammation Xiaoxia Li, Ph.D., Project Leader Project Summary/Abstract Obesity is a crucial public health problem that is associated with low-grade systemic inflammation and cardiovascular disease, affecting 25% of the population and its incidence is growing. IL-1R/TLRs have been directly implicated in obesity-associated inflammatory diseases. TLR2 or TLR4 deficiency reduced diet-induced insulin resistance and atherosclerosis, while human TLR4 null mutations are associated with reduced risk of atherosclerosis. The overall objective of this proposal is to elucidate IL-1R/TLR-mediated signaling mechanisms in the inflammatory response associated with metabolic diseases. Our long-term goals are to identify new therapeutic targets and to develop more effective anti-inflammatory small molecule drugs. Genetic and biochemical studies by us and others revealed that IL- 1R/TLRs interact with the adaptor MyD88 to initiate TAK1 (TGF?-activated kinase 1)- and MEKK3 (MAP kinase kinase kinase 3)-dependent pathways. Each pathway involves cascades of kinases organized by multiple adapter molecules into parallel and sequential signaling complexes, leading to activation of the transcription factor NF?B. IL- 1R/TLRs also mediate mRNA stabilization and promote protein translation of cytokines and chemokines through their impact on RNA binding proteins and translation mediators (mTOR and MnK1). We have previously shown that the kinase activity of IRAK4 (IL-1 receptor-associated kinase) is required for TAK1-dependent NF?B activation and posttranscriptional induction of cytokines and chemokines, but not for MEKK3-dependent NF?B activation. We have recently reported that while IRAK1 and IRAK2 interact with MyD88-IRAK4 to mediate TAK1-dependent NF?B activation and posttranscriptional control respectively; IRAKM (without functional kinase domain) mediates a second wave of IL-1R-TLR-induced NF?B activation through the MEKK3-dependent pathway, but also attenuates protein translation of cytokines and chemokines. In this proposal, we propose two Aims. In Aim 1, we will elucidate the molecular mechanism of IL-1R/TLRs signaling: (1) Delineate the precise molecular mechanism for IRAK1-mediated TAK1-dependent NF?B activation; (2) Investigate the mechanisms of IRAK2-mediated posttranscriptional control of cytokines and chemokines; (3) Elucidate the mechanisms by which IRAKM mediates MEKK3-dependent NF?B activation and its inhibitory effect on translational control of cytokines and chemokines. In Aim 2, we will investigate the mechanism of IL-1R/TLRs signaling for the development of obesity-associated diseases: (1) Study how IL- 1R/TLRs signaling mediate the cross-talk between adipocytes and macrophages contributing to diet-induced systemic inflammation and exacerbation on atherosclerosis; (2) Determine the impact of IL-1R/TLRs signaling in endothelial cells on the recruitment of monocytes and polarization of inflammatory macrophages."
"9388375","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Mitochondrial dysfunction is an underlying cause of cardiomyocyte death and therefore plays a critical role in the development of many cardiac pathologies. This mitochondrial dysfunction is often mediated by the opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT) pore, which causes a rapid increase in inner mitochondrial membrane permeability. This in turn leads to ATP depletion, reactive oxygen species production, mitochondrial swelling and rupture. Consequently, our long-range goal is to identify the proteins that make up the MPT pore and understand the molecular mechanisms by which this complex is regulated. The MPT pore was originally proposed to consist of the voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC) in the outer membrane, the adenine nucleotide translocase (ANT) in the inner membrane, plus a regulatory protein cyclophilin-D (CypD) in the matrix. However, genetic studies have revealed that VDAC and ANT are dispensable for MPT. Thus CypD still remains as the only bona fide member of the MPT pore complex. Importantly, the key factors that directly regulate CypD and its pro-MPT function remain to be elucidated. In particular, CypD-binding proteins that act to inhibit CypD's function have yet to be identified and the additional role that CypD phosphorylation plays in regulating MPT and cell death has not been comprehensively addressed. We have identified the mitochondrial matrix protein C1qbp as a novel CypD-binding protein and our strong preliminary data indicate that it can inhibit MPT and cell death. Conversely, we have found that the pro-death kinase GSK3 can sensitize cells to MPT and death, and that these effects are associated with CypD phosphorylation. Consequently, our central hypothesis is that C1qbp inhibits, whereas GSK3 promotes, MPT and cell death through the direct regulation of CypD. The objective of the present application is to utilize genetic, biochemical, physiological, and pharmacological techniques to systematically evaluate the roles of a CypD inhibitor (C1qbp) and a CypD activator (GSK3) in MPT, cardiac cell death, and the progression of myocardial disease. In Aim 1 we will determine the functional involvement of C1qbp in the MPT response and cardiac myocyte death. In Aim 2 we will evaluate the effects of GSK3-dependent CypD phosphorylation on MPT and cardiac cell death. The rationale for the proposed research is that once key mitochondrial proteins that regulate MPT and mitochondrial function are identified, they can be targeted as a means of treating a whole array of human cardiac diseases."
"9405901","Project Summary  Nicotine is the addictive component of tobacco-derived products. Through binding to a family of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs), nicotine influences a diverse range of cellular mechanisms involved in homeostasis and disease. Although cigarette smoking is a major risk factor for cardiovascular and pulmonary diseases (CVPD) including hypertension, vascular dysfunction and fibrosis, the direct effects and the molecular mechanisms of nicotine in the pathogenesis of these diseases have not been elucidated. Our preliminary data show that cigarette smoke or direct nicotine inhalation disrupts the homeostasis of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS). The role of the RAS in the regulation of blood pressure and the development of CVPD through neurovascular and cardiopulmonary mechanisms has been firmly established. Angiotensin (Ang)-II, by means of its type 1 receptor (AT1R), promotes increased sympathetic activity, salt and water reabsorption, vasoconstriction, aldosterone and vasopressin release and inflammation, contributing to tissue fibrosis, endothelium dysfunction and hypertension. Angiotensin Converting Enzyme type 2 (ACE2) cleaves Ang-II into the vasodilator peptide Ang-(1-7), hence a pivotal player in the ACE2/Ang-(1-7)/Mas receptor compensatory axis of the RAS. AT2R, another receptor for Ang-II, opposes the deleterious effects of AT1R activation, and ACE2-formed Ang-(1-7) was recently shown to activate not only the Mas receptor but also AT2R. Our pilot data suggest that cigarette smoke or nicotine inhalation inhibits the expression of ACE2/AT2R in multiple organs including the brain, heart and lungs, thus disrupting the balance within the RAS. Accordingly, the central hypothesis of this application is: Chronic nicotine inhalation disrupts RAS homeostasis through inhibition of local compensatory mechanisms, leading to increased susceptibility to cardiovascular and pulmonary diseases. Taking advantage of the combined expertise of our multidisciplinary team, we will use state- of-the-art molecular, cellular and pharmacological tools combined with novel transgenic and knockout murine models (ACE2 overexpression and knockout) to assess the direct effects of inhaled nicotine on cardiovascular, autonomic and pulmonary functions. We will address the following Specific Aims: 1) Chronic nicotine inhalation impairs local compensatory activity within the RAS; 2) Chronic nicotine inhalation increases susceptibility?to CVPD; 3) Chronic nicotine inhalation adversely affects the treatment for CVPD. Findings from this study will advance our understanding of the pathogenic mechanisms linked to inhaled nicotine, and set the basis for future development of improved treatment to preserve RAS compensatory activity in CVPD."
"9471939","Project Summary/Abstract Allograft rejection is characterized by effector CD4+ T cell activation in response to donor antigen and an intense cellular and humoral attack on the graft. However, multiple intracellular signals within CD4+ T cells operate co-incidentally to enhance the expansion and function of CD4+Foxp3+ T regulatory cells that collectively serve to control the alloimmune response. Furthermore, the potency of this process of immunoregulation prevents and restrains alloimmune T effector cell activation and rejection. Importantly, recent advances indicate that CD4+Foxp3+ T cell differentiation and function is negatively regulated by the cell intrinsic activity of mTOR and specifically mTORC1. However, little is known about the regulation of intracellular mTOR signaling within alloreactive CD4+ T cell effectors, or how its relative activity may be modulated in Foxp3+ subsets, or whether it is possible to exploit modulatory signals to augment physiological Treg activity in pathological states to prevent disease, including the development of chronic allograft rejection. DEPTOR is a recently discovered cell intrinsic factor that modulates mTOR-induced signaling responses in highly proliferative cancer cells, and it has more recently been observed to function in normal cell types including vascular endothelial cells. In preliminary studies, we find that DEPTOR is expressed at high levels in unactivated CD4+ T cells, and further, that its expression is reduced upon cellular activation. In addition, we find that forced overexpression of DEPTOR modulates CD4+ T cell activation responses in vitro, promotes immunoregulation and prolongs graft survival following fully MHC mismatched transplantation in vivo. We suggest that these observations identify DEPTOR as a critical upstream intracellular modulator of CD4+ T cell activation as well as the phenotypic and functional outcome of the alloimmune response. Our objectives in this R01 are to further evaluate these observations using novel transgenic mice, and 1), define the select function of DEPTOR in CD4+ T effector and regulatory subsets in vivo, and 2), evaluate the consequences of CD4+ T cell DEPTOR expression in models of transplant rejection. We will test the hypothesis that DEPTOR is a cell intrinsic molecule that modulates CD4+ T effector cell activation and augments CD4+ T regulatory cell function to enhance immunoregulation and promote long-term graft survival. We propose two specific aims in which we will: 1), determine the consequences and mechanism of function of cell intrinsic DEPTOR in CD4+ T cell subsets, and 2), determine the function of CD4+ T cell DEPTOR in long-term allograft survival. Collectively, these innovative studies will have broad scientific and biological implications of great significance and relevance to transplantation immunobiology."
"9391701","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Extracellular microRNAs (miRs) in endothelial cells (ECs) can be transported by extracellular carriers to regulate the gene expression in the recipient cells, i.e., smooth muscle cells (SMCs) and macrophages (MOs), and hence modulate vascular physiology and pathophysiology. In the current funding cycle, we demonstrated that distinct flow patterns, i.e. pulsatile shear (PS, the main feature of atheroprotective flow) and oscillatory shear (OS, the main feature of atheroprone flow) differentially regulate the miR expression profiles (miRomes) in ECs to cause up- or down-regulation of genes involved in inflammation, redox state, and proliferation. Moreover, others and we have shown that the shear stress-modulated miRs in ECs (e.g., miR-126 and miR- 143/145) are transferable via carriers such as exosomes or Ago2 to SMCs to target their gene expression and alter their phenotype. In relation to translational application, patients with cardiovascular diseases have been shown to have elevations of miR-126 and miR-92a in association with extracellular vesicles, and a decrease of their associations with lipoproteins. These findings led to the hypothesis of this new proposal that atheroprotective and atheroprone flow patterns modulate distinct miR-transportomes and regulate different miR-targetomes to result in beneficial or detrimental outcome of the vasculature. Specifically, we will expand our study to investigate the mechanisms and functional consequences of the shear stress-regulated EC miR transportomes and SMC/MO targetomes. The four Specific Aims are: (1) to investigate the EC miR transportomes regulated by PS vs. OS. (2) To elucidate the miR uptake mechanism and miR targetomes in recipient SMCs and MOs under PS and OS. (3) To determine the roles of PS- and OS-modulated miR transportomes and targetomes in regulating vascular functions. (4) To validate the flow regulation of miR expression and transmission in the vasculature in animal studies in vivo and in clinical samples from patients with cardiovascular diseases. We will perform flow channel experiments, high-throughput screening, and systems biology analysis and modeling to elucidate the diverse transportomes regulated by PS vs. OS in modulating the targetomes and functions of SMCs and MOs. We will validate and translate our in vitro and in silico results by using mouse models as well as human clinical samples. The proposed research aims at investigating the mechanisms by which miRs mediate the flow-regulation of vascular phenotypes and functions, with the ultimate goal of elucidating the interplays of miRs and shear pattern in the regulation of vascular homeostasis for translational applications."
"9385711","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Atherosclerotic vascular disease remains the leading cause of death in the United States with the majority of mortality due to coronary artery disease and myocardial infarction. Risk factor modification such as reductions in hyperlipidemia constitutes the only treatment strategy available for this vexing disease. Thus, there is an active effort to identify the culprit cellular processes that provide mechanistic insight. Recent reports f the proatherogenic phenotype of mice with a macrophage-specific autophagy deficiency has renewed interest in the role of the autophagy-lysosomal system in atherosclerosis. Lysosomes have the unique role of processing both exogenous material such as excess atherogenic lipids and endogenous cargo that includes dysfunctional proteins and organelles. Since little is known about the effect of an atherogenic environment on macrophage lysosomes, we aimed to test the notion that lysosomal dysfunction is the product of lipid metabolism and evaluate novel ways to ameliorate this effect. Our preliminary data demonstrate that macrophages develop features of lysosome dysfunction upon exposure to atherogenic lipids. In turn, this lysosomal stress can activate TFEB, the only known transcription factor that can broadly stimulate lysosomal biogenesis and function. The regulation of macrophage TFEB appears to be critically linked to mTOR signaling, buttressed by the observation that the classic mTOR inhibitor Rapamycin can induce lysosomal biogenesis while reducing macrophage dysfunction and atherosclerosis. Understanding the links between lipid metabolism and lysosomal biogenesis has important implications in understanding plaque progression. We propose to test the hypothesis that macrophage lysosomal biogenesis mediated by the transcription factor TFEB is an important compensatory response during atherosclerosis and serves an atheroprotective role. A variety of mouse models capable of dissecting the role of TFEB action in macrophages will serve as the research tools to address this hypothesis both in vitro and in vivo."
"9392574","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal describes a five-year training program for development of a career as a physician-scientist in neonatology and medical genetics, with particular expertise in early endoderm and lung development. The candidate is completing a unique five-year fellowship program that will lead to board certification in both neonatal-perinata medicine and medical genetics. This fellowship included three years of intensive research funded by the Ruth L. Kirschstein National Research Service Award (T32). During this time, Dr. Swarr has become particularly interested in the role that the non-coding genome, and lncRNAs in particular, plays in directing normal development, and when disrupted, how these non-coding elements contribute to human disease. During the proposed study period, Dr. Swarr will continue to develop his knowledge of endoderm and lung biology, acquiring additional skills in mouse genetics, epigenetics, stem cell biology, and bioinformatics through a combination of intensive laboratory work, graduate-level courses, conferences, and one-on-one mentoring. This project will be carried out under the mentorship of Edward E. Morrisey, PhD, a recognized leader in the field of pulmonary biology. Dr. Morrisey is a Professor of both Medicine and Cell and Molecular Biology, as well as the Scientific Director of the Institute for Regenerative Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania. He has mentored numerous postdoctoral fellows and graduate students. An Advisory Committee, consisting of Drs. Michael Beers, Klaus Kaestner, Ken Zaret, and Rebecca Simmons, will assist Dr. Morrisey in mentoring Dr. Swarr to independence. Each of these faculty members is a highly regarded scientist in his or her own right, and all have successfully mentored many graduate students, post-doctoral fellows, and trainee physician- scientists. The proposed research focuses on the role that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) play during early endoderm and lung development. Although a number of critical transcription factors and molecular pathways have been identified that direct fundamental aspects of lung development, the molecular mechanisms by which these master regulatory signals are carefully coordinated remains poorly defined. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have recently been recognized to provide a crucial layer of control over proper gene expression, playing essential roles in both normal development and human disease. Dr. Swarr, with others in the Morrisey laboratory, have recently demonstrated that lncRNAs are spatially correlated with transcription factors and regulate lung development (Herriges MJ and Swarr DT, et al. Genes Dev. 2014 Jun 15;28(12):1363-79). In this same study, Dr. Swarr identified a lncRNA located 2kb downstream of Foxa2, herein referred to as Falcor (for Foxa2-Adjaent Long non-COding RNA). The pioneering transcription factor Foxa2 is known to play important roles in early endoderm specification and subsequent differentiation of the lung. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that Falcor plays a critical role in regulating the proper expression of Foxa2, and as a result is an essential orchestrator of endoderm and lung development. In Aim 1, CRISPR-Cas9 technology will be employed to study the role of Falcor in both mouse and human development. In Aim 1a, a Falcor knockout mouse model, which has already been generated, will be used to study the effects of loss of Falcor in vivo. In Aim 1b, the role of Falcr in human development will be studied by differentiating Falcor human embryonic stem (ES) cell knockout lines into definitive endoderm, and ultimately, mature airway epithelium. In Aim 2, the molecular mechanisms by which Falcor regulates the expression of Foxa2 will be defined. A comprehensive proteomics-based approach will be used to identify proteins interacting with Falcor, and the functional significance of these interactions will be interrogated using a series o shRNA knockdown experiments. The research outlined in this proposal will provide novel insights into the function of lncRNAs in early endoderm and lung development, with potential impact for a broad range of lung diseases, from congenital malformations to adult lung cancer. Moreover, by completing this work, I will acquire the necessary technical skills and scientific expertise to become a physician-scientist in neonatal-perinatal medicine and medical genetics with expertise in the mechanisms by which the non-coding genome and epigenetic processes direct normal development, and how disruptions of these developmental processes lead to congenital malformations and pulmonary disease."
"9402119","PROJECT SUMMARY Various neuromuscular diseases result in impaired cough (dystussia). Disorders of these airway protective behaviors increase pulmonary infection due to aspiration, the leading cause of death in neuromuscular disease. Mortality rates of aspiration pneumonia - present in over half of long-term care residents - can approach 40%. Defense of the airway is achieved through coordination of multiple protective behaviors by brain circuits that remain incompletely understood. A contemporary data-driven computational model incorporating the brainstem network for breathing can rapidly reconfigure to produce the three phases a cough motor pattern: inspiration, compression, and expulsion. However, critical elements of airway protection cannot be explained. Based on motivating preliminary data and network simulations, we propose that a circuit in the nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS) and dorsal medulla regulates phase timing and respiratory muscle drive during paroxysmal coughs and exerts a command function over the brainstem respiratory control system to coordinate coughing and breathing. The project has 3 Specific Aims: (1) Determine dynamic behavior- dependent organization of NTS circuits during the expression of airway protective behaviors. (2) Determine functional connectivity between NTS and VRC neurons during expression of coughing. (3) Reconstruct our respiratory system model to incorporate regulation of both airway protective reflexes and breathing. Our unique approach, building upon experimental interrogation of the NTS region, incorporates multi-array recording technologies in an animal model system that generates defensive behaviors in response to physiologically relevant airway perturbations. We anticipate that the project will lead to: a) a new, predictive model of airway protection will be produced, b) we will understand functional relationships between conditionally active cells and t-E NTS neurons in producing cough, and c) we will identify critical NTS to parafacial/VRC functional relationships that regulate cough and breathing. This new knowledge will provide a critical step in understanding the neurogenesis of cough and how this behavior is controlled to protect the airway."
"9391711","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)    Mitochondrial diseases caused by mutations in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) are a significant source of morbidity and mortality, yet only supportive care is available to affected patients. This lack of effective therapies can be partly attributed to the lack of faithful animal models for mitochondrial diseases caused by mutations in mtDNA. Two critical obstacles to the availability of mouse models of these diseases are 1) the lack of mouse mtDNA mutations homologous to those found in human disease, and 2) the lack of a method to efficiently generate such mutations. Therefore, the long-term goals of the proposed studies are 1) to overcome these obstacles in order to enable routine modeling of human diseases caused by mtDNA mutations, and 2) to provide mouse models of mitochondrial disease to the research community. In this application, we propose to leverage expertise developed at the University of South Alabama (mutagenesis of mouse mtDNA) and Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (transmitochondrial mouse models) towards generating models of human diseases caused by mutations in mitochondrially-encoded tRNA genes. Using the tools and techniques developed in the previous funding cycle and in preliminary studies, we will 1) generate an arrayed library of mouse clones carrying mutations in mtDNA, 2) use it to perform a targeted screening for mutations in tRNALeuUUR and in tRNALys, and 3) use these mutations as well as tRNA mutations isolated by us previously for the generation and characterization of transmitochondrial animals. It is anticipated that, if successful, the proposed studies will deliver a powerful impetus to mitochondrial research in general and to research on mitochondrial disease in particular by providing the mitochondrial research community with (1) mouse model(s) for mitochondrial disease caused by mutations in tRNA genes, (2) an arrayed library of mouse clones suitable for targeted screening for mtDNA mutations of interest as well as tools and protocols for generating and screening such libraries, and (3) cell line(s) carrying mouse homolog(s) of human pathogenic mtDNA mutations."
"9393830","ABSTRACT Successful dissemination and translation of alcohol prevention research into community-based practice is an essential component of the ?Environmental Approaches to Prevention? Research Center Grant. Over the past five years, Center Grant staff took steps to achieve this overarching goal through two major activities: (1) they met with county and community practitioners involved in the 24-city randomized trial (Component #2: ?Environmental Prevention Strategies to Reduce Community Alcohol Problems?) to learn more about what types of environmental alcohol prevention strategies the practitioners were working on, and to determine what additional information and skills they needed to implement evidence-based interventions (e.g., alcohol policy enforcement and related visibility activities); and (2) they used that information to develop dissemination methods and products. These included: (a) documents and tools to guide practitioners in selecting the evidence-based intervention strategies best suited to their needs; (b) a Resource Link website hosted by PRC that allows anyone to access these tools and documents; and (c) a newsletter to capture and publicize successful intervention activities in the intervention communities and elsewhere. For the renewal of Component #2: ?Information and Dissemination in Support of Community Interventions,? we will build on our experiences from the past five years to enhance our dissemination capabilities and reach a broader audience of community prevention practitioners, policymakers, and organizations/agencies across the U.S. We will update the Resource Link website with interactive features (including posting webinars and providing an opportunity for users to contact the research staff directly), and use digital technology to optimize the number of times that Resource Link is returned in Internet searches. We will use digital social media (e.g., Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube) to broadcast information about Resource Link, including publicizing webinars and new resources to general and target audiences. At the same time, we will work closely with other PRC scientists to identify and develop dissemination products related to new research results, including findings from the proposed Center Grant components. We will work with other organizations that can act as ?information brokers? to effectively disseminate research findings from the Center Grant and other PRC projects. Finally, we will obtain feedback from a panel of experts who review the new products and interactive tools on Resource Link and related webinars. In summary, the specific aims for the Information and Dissemination Component are to: (1) disseminate scientific materials based on key research findings from past and on-going PRC projects to general audiences and to an expanded list of targeted audiences (e.g., increasing the Resource Link website?s interactivity by conducting and adding digitally-recorded webinars); (2) provide technical assistance to alcohol prevention practitioners, policy-makers and organizations/agencies working to reduce harms associated with alcohol misuse (e.g., direct communication with PRC research staff via telephone or Skype); and (3) assess the extent to which Aims 1 and 2 are accomplished by monitoring and documenting relevant indicators (i.e., results of search engine optimization efforts, website visits, website information requests, technical assistance requests and type of contact, participation in webinars, and media releases)."
"9444745","Project Summary Aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD) is a common, severe idiopathic disorder characterized by asthma, recurrent nasal polyposis, and marked eosinophilic inflammation of the sinonasal and bronchial mucosa. The disease is consistently associated with markedly dysregulated cysteinyl leukotriene production, and with cryptic over-activation of platelets. This proposal will focus on understanding how these two features drive the pathophysiology of the disease. The central hypothesis is that an autocrine, LTC4-mediated platelet activation pathway plays a critical role in driving the exaggerated type 2 immunopathology associated with AERD, and is central to pathognomonic reactions to ASA. Platelet-associated CysLT2R and HMGB1 are each necessary for these features. A corollary hypothesis is that neutralization of platelet HMGB1 by salicylic acid (SA) contributes to the therapeutic effect of ASA therapy in AERD. We will use newly created transgenic mice, a novel model of AERD, and cells and tissues from carefully characterized human subjects to test the hypothesis. The studies proposed will reveal potential causative mechanisms in AERD and identify therapeutic targets that could restore normal homeostasis, and are the first to integrate CysLT2R into AERD pathophysiology."
"9442422","Abstract Individuals with Parkinson disease (PD) experience vocal communication deficits that negatively impact health and quality of life. PD pathology is widespread, including alpha-synuclein aggregation and decreases in neurotransmission within brainstem regions. However, very little is known about how these PD-associated pathologies contribute to vocal communication deficits and thus, current treatments are ineffective. To develop treatments tailored to vocal dysfunction, it is paramount to understand pathology at gene and protein levels. The proposed research will address these unknowns by profiling differentially expressed transcripts using RNA sequencing in brainstem regions linked to vocal production in health and PD. We will use a validated rat model of PD, Pink1-/-, and compare data to aged-matched wildtype (WT) controls. Pink1-/- rats show early, progressive vocal communication deficits that recapitulate communication deficits in human PD. Pink1 -/- and WT rats will be studied at two timepoints, 2 months (prior to deficits) and 8 months (early-stage pathology). Because there are known sex differences with human PD, we will characterize female vocalizations and correlative pathology. The proposed work is a series of studies that are an exploratory, descriptive, and hypothesis-driven to demonstrate associations between vocal behavior, gene expression networks, and consequences on protein regulation. Specific aims for this proposal are 1A) to identify and compare large-scale gene expression variations in brainstem regions that regulate vocal communication in Pink1 -/- and WT male and female rats and 1B) biologically validate vocalization-related modules correlated to individual gene, protein, and vocal data in Pink1 -/- and WT male and female rats. We hypothesize that male and female Pink1 -/- rats will show functional vocal deficits compared to WT (Experiment (Exp) 1) and we expect behavioral differences between male and female rats within both genotypes and between genotypes (Exp 2). We expect vocal parameters to differ between 2 and 8 months of age for all groups. Further, we expect that Pink1 -/- rats will demonstrate differential expression of genes involved in neurotransmitter, receptor, and enzyme expression, homeostatic function, growth factors, synaptic plasticity and transcription factors, as well as key genes associated with PD pathology in the periaqueductal gray and nucleus ambiguus, but not the non-vocal motor red nucleus, compared to WT (Exp 3). WCGNA bioinformatics analysis will identify differentially expressed genes that can be categorized into network modules based on function in Pink1 -/- rats compared to WT (Exp 4). Finally, we expect that the individual relative mRNA expression (Exp 5) and protein concentrations (Exp 6) will correlate with the extent of vocal dysfunction. These data will provide insight into novel targets that represent a direct mechanistic link to vocal deficits in PD. This translational research combines techniques and theory from behavioral, molecular, and physiological sciences and will provide in-depth knowledge of biomarkers related to PD vocalization deficits."
"9471965","The long-term objective of this proposal is to create more effective means by which to eradicate leukemia stem cells (LSCs). While multiple strategies have been described in the literature, finding approaches capable of broadly targeting LSC populations has remained elusive. We and others have described extensive intra-patient heterogeneity in human LSC populations, which we believe is an important factor to address in creating improved therapeutic regimens. To better understand the cellular and molecular drivers of LSC heterogeneity, we have conducted studies that demonstrate major differences in LSCs that occur purely as a function of their local tissue microenvironment. Particularly striking are differences observed between LSCs in bone marrow and adipose tissue, where upon localization to adipose tissue we observe a strong induction of fatty acid oxidation (FAO), reduced cell cycle activity and increased resistance to chemotherapy drugs. Thus, a central premise of the current application is that intra-patient LSC heterogeneity can arise due to extrinsic (i.e. microenvironmental) factors that vary as a function of anatomical site. Further, our data clearly imply a causal link between the microenvironment-induced metabolic state of LSCs and their sensitivity to drugs. The studies proposed herein are designed to identify and characterize key mechanisms that control LSC metabolism as a function of microenvironment. Lines of investigation will include analysis of cell intrinsic and extrinsic regulators of LSC metabolism."

This Program has always been distinguished nationally for its strength in DNA replication and DNA repair, with an emphasis on applying discoveries toward cancer chemotherapy. During the project period, Preet Chaudhary joined Michael Lieber as Co-Leader to add depth in translation and oversee a new theme on the molecular genetics of cancers associated with infection by HHV8, including the development of targeted therapies for the treatment of these cancers. The Program has three integrated aims: 1) DNA replication, cell cycle, and cell proliferation in genetic instability; 2) DNA repair and recombination in genetic instability; and 3) viral oncogenesis with an emphasis on HHV8. Lymphoid malignancies are used as a disease model used by Program members for all three aims. Members continue to be highly interactive within and across themes and across program boundaries. The 39 Program members, who come from three schools and 13 departments, have $11.4M in peer-reviewed funding (direct costs), of which 18% is from NCI, 61% from other NIH sources, and 8% from other peer-reviewed funding sources. The Program is highly productive with 439 publications of which 21% are inter-programmatic, 15% intra-programmatic and 25% inter-institutional. Program Leaders organize retreats and mini-symposia several times per year to cross-fertilize research within and across Programs while remaining watchful to ensure a high level of member crosstalk. This has led to high success in securing new P01s that are intra- and inter-programmatic, while also cross-cutting thematically. Examples include renewal of an NCI P01 on understanding human DNA polymerase active sites and development of new chemotherapeutics (Goodman, McKenna, Warshel), and a new NCI P01 on viral oncogenesis by KSHV (HHV8) (Jung, Feng, Gao). Members have been particularly successful in seeking new cancer drug therapies, which has been achieved with the Translational and Clinical Sciences Program."

These standards are designed to promote uniformity and consistency among animal feed regulatory programs and are consistent with the principles of the FSMA. Twenty-two (22) states have elected to implement the AFRPS and are required to attend an annual meeting known as the AFRPS Face-to-Face. Each of those States are required to send two (2) employees from the State Program and two (2) employees from the Laboratory to attend each Face-to-Face meeting. The meeting allows for the both groups to gather together and share best practices and any lessons learned as well as the opportunity to address any concerns that have been identified and discuss possible solutions to overcome any challenges. Many FDA personnel from varying Divisions and Offices are present during the Face-to-Face meeting to provide helpful insight and guidance. In 2018 the Face-to-Face will be held March 20th through noon on March 22nd at the Omni Hotel in Jacksonville, Florida. The 2018 agenda will be developed to capitalize on the implemented work in order to assist those States that are in need of guidance to achieve implementation or accreditation. The multiple year funding received from the grant will be utilized to further enhance the collaborative efforts of all those States Programs which are currently enrolled in the AFRPS and the State Laboratories that are working to achieve ISO 17025:2005 Accreditation.

"9455332","Abstract: Filoviruses, which include Marburg virus (MARV) and Ebola virus (EBOV), have a high fatality rate and still lack FDA approved therapeutics or vaccines for treatment. Filoviruses have a filamentous lipid- envelope and despite being discovered more than 40 years ago, not much is known on how they assemble and bud from the host cell plasma membrane during their replication cycle. Filoviruses encode seven genes including the viral matrix protein VP40, which regulates budding from the host cell plasma membrane. Understanding the budding processes of several viruses has had significant impact on elucidating the viral life cycle and identifying therapeutic targets. Indeed, VP40 has been suggested in some studies to be a viable drug target. The goal of this application is to examine the biochemical and biophysical effects of mutations found in VP40 in patients from previous outbreaks. In specific aim 1, we hypothesize that an anionic to neutral amino acid substitution on the purported interfacial-binding surface of MARV VP40, permits enhanced lipid-binding properties and a reduction in the anionic charge density of lipid membrane required for in vitro lipid binding and cellular assembly at the plasma membrane. We will use in vitro biophysical assays, quantitative live cell imaging, and VLP release assays to come to quantitative and confident conclusions on the role of this mutation in MARV VP40 assembly and budding. Specific aim 2 will investigate the effects of a EBOV VP40 mutation, discovered in patients during the course of the recent EBOV outbreak, which lies in the purported membrane-binding interface of EBOV VP40. Lipid-binding, cellular assembly and VP40 oligomerization properties will be investigated. Quantitative assays of VP40 oligomerization state, VP40 lipid binding, and budding of VLPs will be assessed to decipher the role of this VP40 C-terminal domain mutation on EBOV VP40 biophysical and biochemical properties. Taken together, these studies should produce new and important mechanistic insight into biochemical consequences of VP40 mutations that occur during passage of virus through humans. "
"9386757","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cardiovascular disease remains the primary cause of death and disability in the United States. Death is most commonly a direct result of ventricular arrhythmia which, in turn, is the consequence of alternations in ion channel function, affecting action potentials and cell-cell communication. Altered ion channel function in failing hearts also limits the heart's contractility, further worsening heart failure and the vicious cycle towards arrhythmia and death. Individual ion channels have half-lives that are on the order of hours, and a major cause of altered ion channel function in failing hearts is altered trafficking. Altered trafficking implies that the channels are not delivered to the correct subdomain on the cardiomyocyte plasma membrane (forward trafficking), or are removed incorrectly (reverse trafficking or internalization). Altered forward and reverse trafficking are components of most cardiac disorders. However the mechanisms of forward and reverse trafficking of membrane proteins, especially of cardiac ion channels, remain poorly understood.  My laboratory explores the basic mechanisms of cardiac ion channel trafficking. In this competitive renewal, we will identify three novel pathways with strong preliminary data for each. The channels of interest are the Connexin43 gap junction channel responsible for cell-cell communication, and the L-type Calcium Channel (alpha subunit Cav1.2), which is responsible for triggering the beat-to- beat intracellular calcium transient which initiates and helps determine the strength of each cardiac contraction. Each of the three pathways explored is a separate specific aim of this proposal.  Aim #1 is to determine if alternative translation is a mechanism of Cx43 auto regulation of forward traffic in health and disease. We have evidence in human heart that as many as six in frame AUG sequences initiate translation within the Cx43 (GJA1) exon. Our data indicate the truncated Cx43 isoforms are necessary at least for Cx43 exit from the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus.  Aim #2 is to determine how the actin cytoskeleton contributes to directed channel delivery. Our studies indicate that the majority of intracellular Cx43 is moving slowly or not moving at all, due to association with actin. We have developed a novel microfluidics based cell patterning system to quantify actin dynamics and its contribution to ion channel trafficking and are finding that actin is important to working with microtubules in providing specificity of Cx43 and Cav1.2 delivery.  Aim #3 is to elucidate the post-translation cascade by which Cx43 is internalized from the plasma membrane. We have evidence that serine 373 phosphorylation on the Cx43 C-terminus needs to precede serine 368 phopsphorylation. Our new data will explore mechanism of phosphorylation dependent internalization and whether the products of alternative translation are involved."

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Child mortality in the United States is most commonly attributed to trauma and sepsis, the major research focus of our research team at the Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh Site of the National Institutes of Child Health and Development (NICHD) Collaborative Pediatric Critical Care Research Network (CPCCRN). This is a renewal application to continue participation in the third cycle of the NICHD-CPCCRN with the goals of collaboratively supporting existing and new studies developed by the Pediatric Trauma and Critical Illness Branch network and also extending our center's novel work within the CPCCRN in host-pathogen interactions in trauma and sepsis. Over the past 9 years our center has provided 24,000 patients to over 22 CPCCRN studies. Our center's program of research in host-pathogen interactions has led to three CPCCRN approved studies. In the first cycle we showed that trauma patients have a two-fold increased risk of developing nosocomial infection and sepsis compared to non-trauma patients. In the second cycle we commenced the ongoing NIGMS-R01 funded Inflammation Phenotypes in Pediatric Severe Sepsis study (PI: Carcillo) which examines the influence of host inflammation phenotype response on nosocomial infection and sepsis outcomes in trauma and non-trauma patients. In our new concept proposal for this third cycle we respond to the NIH roadmap initiative's call for improved understanding of the role of the microbiome in health and disease by evaluating microbiome perturbations in critical illness. In our single center pilot study we found that critically ill children suffered `dysbiosis with loss of microbiome diversity and site specificity with a tendency to formation of an abundant microorganism (> 30% of the microbiome) which could be found in the patient's room and in the patient two days before the onset of nosocomial infection. If we demonstrate that these findings are generalizable across the CPCCRN then this will open the possibility of a new era of microbiome based medicine for prevention and treatment of nosocomial infection and sepsis in critically injured children."
"9424301","PROJECT ABSTRACT/SUMMARY Kidney transplantation is the preferred modality of treatment for end-stage renal disease (ESRD), as it improves quality of life and survival for patients with ESRD. However, racial and ethnic disparities in access to kidney transplantation are present in adults and children with chronic kidney disease. The lower access of black and Hispanic adults to kidney transplant has been ascribed to late referral for nephrology care, delayed referral for transplant evaluation, lower socioeconomic status, and differences in cultural beliefs or attitudes surrounding organ transplantation. However, the fact that similar racial and ethnic disparities are also present in children (who have better access to healthcare than adults, and for whom transplantation is the standard ESRD treatment modality) suggests that there may be additional barriers that contribute to these disparities. For example, some studies have suggested that chronic kidney disease (CKD) progresses more rapidly in black and Hispanic patients, which could shorten the time available for transplant evaluation, waitlisting, and preemptive surgery during the advanced stages of CKD (prior to dialysis). In addition, since obesity is more prevalent in racial and ethnic minorities in the United States, and most transplant centers have body mass index criterion for transplantation and kidney donation, this policy may disproportionately disadvantage black or Hispanic recipients despite the absence of solid evidence that long-term allograft outcomes are worse in obese recipients. Donor perceptions regarding their own health, or transplant center's assessment of donor suitability, may also differ by donor race or ethnicity. Thus, the objective of this proposal is to evaluate disparities in transplant access in both adults and children within the context of medical risk factors (and policies surrounding these risk factors) that may disadvantage black or Hispanic patients, compared to their non-Hispanic white counterparts. In Aim 1, we propose to examine whether there are differences in the time spent in the advanced stages of CKD (stage 4 or 5) by race or ethnicity (when evaluation for waitlisting or transplantation typically occurs) using individual level data from four national CKD cohorts. In Aim 2, we propose to evaluate how body mass index may contribute to racial and ethnic disparities in access to transplantation or suitability for kidney donation using data from the United States Renal Data System (recipients) and University of California San Francisco [UCSF] (donors). In Aim 3, we propose to establish a prospective study of potential living kidney donors to compare donor perceptions of their health with objective measures of donor risk and the transplant center's perception of donor suitability by race and ethnicity. UCSF is well-suited for the conduct of this proposal, given that it is one of the largest transplant centers in the US, performing 300-350 kidney transplants (including about 150 living donor transplants) annually. Our study will inform whether policy changes are needed to improve parity in access to kidney transplantation and will facilitate the design of additional strategies to enhance organ donation among racial and ethnic minorities."
"9423471","Project Summary Stressful life events contribute to the etiology of anxiety and hypertension and increase the risk for cardiovascular disease, which is the leading cause of death in the U.S. Despite a myriad of research, nearly one-third of patients with anxiety and/or hypertension are resistant to current treatments and understanding the pathophysiology underlying these disorders is necessary to identify novel therapeutics. Stressors perceived in the environment or those arising from the internal milieu create neural signals that converge on the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN), which integrates these signals and transduces them into cardiovascular, neuroendocrine and behavioral responses. Chronic unpredictable stress elicits gene x environment interactions that promote neurochemical plasticity within the PVN that heighten stress responsiveness and promote affective and cardiovascular disorders. A premise of this proposal is that angiotensin receptor signaling within the PVN is a key mediator of gene x environment interactions that control cardiovascular reactivity, neuroendocrine axes and anxiety subsequent to chronic stress. Traditionally, the RAS is considered an endocrine system that elevates blood pressure by increasing the binding of angiotensin II (Ang-II) to its angiotensin type-1 receptor (AT1R). However, we recently found that optogenetic activation of neurons in the PVN that express AT1R(s) augment, but optogenetic inhibition or selective deletion of AT1R(s) from the PVN dampen stress responding in mice. Concomitantly, we evaluated the influence of brain angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) on stress responding. Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 metabolizes Ang-II into angiotensin 1-7 which promotes cardio- protection, in part, by activating Mas receptors. Interestingly, we discovered that up-regulating ACE2 activity in the brain potently dampens stress responding in mice. Collectively, these observations have led to our overall hypothesis that balance between AT1R stimulation and ACE2 activity dictates excitation or inhibition of specific neuronal phenotypes within the PVN to promote susceptibility or resiliency to stress-related disease. We propose the following specific aims to substantiate or refute this hypothesis. Aim 1 uses mice with Cre recombinase directed to AT1R(s) and in vivo optogenetics to test the hypothesis that chronic excitation of AT1R-expressing neurons in the PVN recapitulates the pathophysiology that follows chronic stress. Aim 2 uses mice with AT1R selectively deleted from the PVN to test the hypothesis that such receptors mediate gene x environment interactions that exaggerate stress responding subsequent to chronic stress. Aim 3 uses mice with ACE2 overexpression directed to neurons that synthesize corticotrophin-releasing-hormone (CRH) to test the hypothesis that CRH-ACE2 interactions relieve chronic stress-induced pathophysiology. Collectively, the proposed research will reveal, at a very detailed and mechanistic level, how brain angiotensin signaling contributes to the etiology of stress-related disease and will inform on novel therapeutics."
"9387325","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): With an estimated annual incidence of 300,000-350,000 and accounting for 50% of all cardiovascular deaths in the US, sudden cardiac death (SCD) is a condition with significant implications for public health. Despite ongoing treatment advances in resuscitation science, survival among out-of-hospital cardiac arrest victims is <10%, making SCD prediction and prevention essential. While SCD risk is strongly associated with increasing age, manifestation in middle age (35-59 yr; approx. 30% of all SCD) is the most significant contributor to societal burden. However, published studies of SCD have focused almost exclusively on older patients (?60 yr), partly explained by insufficient numbers of middle-aged SCD cases among existing cardiovascular cohort studies. We have recently reported evidence for a distinctive profile of SCD in middle age compared to older age, indicating the significance of identifying middle age-specific SCD mechanisms. Middle aged SCD patients were more likely to present without prior warning, with obesity and non-white race playing a more important role. The overall hypothesis of this proposal is that a detailed and focused examination of novel factors associated with SCD in middle age will enhance the understanding of mechanisms and contribute to improved SCD risk prediction and prevention. Our specific aims are 1) To identify features of malignant coronary events that provoke lethal arrhythmias in middle age 2) To identify novel obesity-related risk factors contributing to SCD risk; and 3) To identify patient subgroups at highest risk of SCD in middle age.  Over twelve years ago, we initiated the Oregon Sudden Unexpected Death Study (Oregon SUDS) to identify novel risk predictors for SCD. This large study among one million residents of the Portland, Oregon metro area continues to accrue a significant number of SCD cases and controls. The critical need to identify risk predictors for SCD in middle age currently represents the largest knowledge gap in SCD. The established Oregon SUDS provides a unique discovery population with sufficient numbers of subjects, coupled with the opportunity to leverage existing detailed clinical and biomarker information. There is a high likelihood of identifying clinically and mechanistically relevant predictors of SCD risk that will enhance prediction and prevention of SCD."
"9469096","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The cerebral cortex contains enormous neuronal diversity that during development become integrated into a startling array of neural circuits. Despite comprising the minority of all neocortical cells, Inhibitory GABAergic interneurons (INs) play an important role in the stability of the circuits underlying cognitive and higher-order brain function. it is becoming evident that neuropsychiatric disorders disproportionately arise from insults affecting interneuron development, including epilepsy, autism, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia. Therefore, characterizing the molecular mechanisms that control IN fate is crucial for our ability to understand the brain in health and disease. INs are born in the ventral telencephalon, primarily in the medial, caudal, and lateral ganglionic eminences (MGE, CGE, and LGE) and migrate tangentially to reach their settling position in the cortex. Despite their diversity, INs are classified into four non-overlapping functional cell types: parvalbumin (PV), somatostatin (SST), vasoactive-intestinal peptide (VIP), and Reelin-expressing cortical INs. However, little is known about the mechanisms of fate determination that control the establishment and diversification of these populations. Compounding the difficulty of studying these questions, INs are born embryonically but only acquire their subtype specific character in the second postnatal week. Genetic fate mapping and transplantation efforts indicate that embryonic progenitors preferentially give rise to defined populations in the adult brain. Yet transcriptional profiling of progenitors within the proliferative zones of the ganglionic eminences found homogenous programs with no clear evidence of fate bifurcation. Given that epigenetic regulation precedes the transcriptional output, this proposal seeks to better understand the mechanisms by which progenitors epigenetically commit to their mature fate (addressed in Aim 1). The proposed experiments will test the hypothesis that progenitors are epigenetically primed through active chromatin configurations at enhancer sites that precede the activation of cell-type specific transcriptional program. The focus of this proposal is on MGE progenitors that give rise to PV and SST cell types. Additionally, this proposal will examine how PV and SST cell identities are maintained during development by the epigenetic role of the Satb1 gene (addressed in Aim 2). To accomplish these aims, an integrative genomic analysis driven by an assay for transposase accessible chromatin (ATAC-seq) will be used to build an epigenomic map of regulatory regions that drive cell fate specification and maturation. This information will be used to elucidate the developmental trajectories of interneurons from progenitors to mature cell types. Ultimately, this information will improve our understanding of the spatial and temporal control of progenitor differentiation into distinct subclasses, which can be used to identify critical stages on interneuron development. This study will play an important role in identifying and treating neuropsychiatric diseases associated with cell-type specific interneuron dysfunction."
"9456240","Project Summary Anxiety is characterized by anticipation of potential future threats. However, our basic understanding of the neurobiology of attentional and perceptual biases to threat in anxiety is based, not on prestimulus anticipatory response, but on actual neural response to threatening stimuli. These biases are characterized as being driven in a ?bottom-up? manner by threatening stimuli due to their evolutionary salience or physical characteristics. Hence, our knowledge regarding top-down anticipatory factors such as expectations, prior knowledge and contexts in guiding threat perception in anxiety is sparse at best. This stands in stark contrast to substantial basic cognitive neuroscience research demonstrating that top-down prestimulus factors guide perception of threatening and non-threatening stimuli, as well as clinical research showing that anxiety is characterized by inflated expectancies regarding upcoming threats. The overarching goal of this proposal is to bridge this gap in the literature and 1) examine the neural circuitry that implements threat-related top-down biases and its contribution to enhanced perception of threatening stimuli in anxiety and 2) examine whether the neural circuitry implementing top- down and bottom-up contributions to threat perception and their interaction maps on differently to different dimensions of anxiety studied transdiagnostically, thereby establishing the clinical specificity of these measures. Four groups of participants (N=30 each) with a diagnosis of Generalized Anxiety Disorder, Social Anxiety Disorder, Panic Disorder or no anxiety disorder with a range of levels of Anxious Apprehension (AP) and Anxious Arousal (AR) will complete a perceptual decision-making task in which threatening or neutral cues are used to identify subsequently presented fearful and neutral faces. Signal detection measures as well as cue- and stimulus-related brain activity will be recorded via functional magnetic resonance imaging in fusiform face area (FFA), superior temporal sulcus (STS) and amygdala, involved in processing emotional expressions and ventromedial prefrontal cortex involved in maintaining prestimulus representations, to test 3 specific aims. The first aim of this proposal is to delineate the contribution of threat-related cues, as well as prestimulus and stimulus-related neural activity and connectivity in facilitating subsequent perceptual decision making across all participants. The second aim is to determine if enhanced perception and increased prestimulus or stimulus- related neural activity and connectivity due to threat cues is related to AP, even when controlling for AR and diagnostic group status. The final aim is to determine if enhanced perception of threat stimulus (irrespective of cue) and related neural activity and connectivity is associated with AR even when controlling for AP and diagnostic group status. Hence, these aims will establish the specificity of neural measures of top-down and bottom-up aspects of threat perception for AP and AR. Overall, this project will represent an important step in clarifying the neurobiology of anxiety disorders which is predominantly based on prioritized and relatively automatic processing of threatening stimuli. The proposed research will shed light on how prior knowledge about threatening information helps to guide perception in normal and anxious individuals, allowing us to build more comprehensive and ecologically pertinent models in which prior learning, experiences and expectations factor into explaining threat perception in anxiety. Importantly, by examining the differential relationship of prestimulus and stimulus-related neural circuitry with AP and AR transdiagnostically, we hope to uncover potential ways of understanding the structure of anxiety disorders that are not based on traditional DSM diagnostic criteria. Finally, identification of these transdiagnostic affective and neural measures is an important first step towards the development newer treatments for anxiety and improvement of existing treatments that rely on modification of attentional biases."
"9449043","Receptor binding, capsid expansion, and conversion to A-particles are the earliest steps in enterovirus infection of a cell. The conversion of mature virus to A-particles is catalyzed by virus receptors. The goal of this work is to understand these events in order to better understand how the viruses infect cells. An allosteric model describes the kinetics for receptor-catalyzed conversion of Coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) to inactive A- particles at 37C, and should be relevant to related enteroviruses. This model has been used to predict the effects of specific mutations that alter virus stability. Hypothesis 1: The mutation of leucine in VP1 residue 92 to valine (L1092V) increases CVB3/28 stability at 37C by shifting the conformational (?breathing?) equilibrium (Keq) in favor of the closed conformation. This hypothesis will be tested by determining Keq and k from dose response curves of soluble receptor (sCAR)-catalyzed inactivation of CVB3/28 L1092V and comparing the results to those obtained using CVB3/28. Hypothesis 2: The mutation of alanine in VP3 residue 180 to threonine (A3180T) increases virus stability at 37C by slowing the rate, k (maximum receptor-catalyzed inactivation rate), of conversion from the open conformation to the A-particle. This hypothesis will be tested as in aim 1, comparing results from CVB3/28 A3180T with those from CVB3/28. Residue 3180 is located at an interface between protomers, and the model predicts that the increased stability imparted by the mutation will diminish k, but not Keq, relative to values observed with CVB3/28. In tests of both hypotheses, estimates of Kd and Kd? (equilibrium dissociation constants for the closed and open conformations) will also result from fitting the model(s) to the data. These binding constants will also be compared among virus strains by direct analysis at temperatures <25C. The results will help refine the allosteric model, and provide new information regarding structure and function in the viruses and their interaction with receptor. The proposed experiments examine specific biological features important for infection of susceptible cells that are shared by many enteroviruses and rhinoviruses that cause human disease. New knowledge of these features may lead to new ways to impede infection by shifting the conformational equilibrium toward the stable closed form (as with some antivirals). Such knowledge may also reveal new approaches to antivirals through destabilizing the virus before it can interact with a host cell. The relationship between virus strains with different inherent stabilities and the kinetics of receptor-catalyzed conversion to A-particles have not been examined for these viruses. New information regarding virus capsid structure-function is anticipated."
"9386053","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Angioplasty and stenting for peripheral artery disease (PAD) of the femoropopliteal artery segment, consisting of the superficial femoral artery (SFA) and popliteal artery (PA), carries the highest rate of reconstruction failure primarily because it undergoes large deformations during flexion of the limb. Our preliminary data demonstrate that previously published limb-induced deformations of the SFA and PA are markedly underestimated, and that certain stent designs are not able to accommodate these severe deformations. We propose to precisely quantify the mechanical environments of the SFA and PA in order to determine the optimal patient and lesion- specific stent for the SFA and PA. This will be accomplished through 3 Specific Aims.  In Aim 1 we will determine the 3D bending, torsion and compression of the SFA and PA as a result of limb flexion in human cadavers using our new intra-arterial marker technique, CTA, and image analysis. In Aim 2 we will determine the biaxial mechanical properties of SFA and PA from human tissue donors with PAD, along with the mechanical properties of 5 commonly used self-expanding nitinol PAD stents. In Aim 3 we will use the data on femoropopliteal artery flexions (Aim 1) and SFA, PA and PAD stent mechanical properties (Aim 2), to build a computational model of the stented SFA and PA. This model will then be subjected to limb flexion induced deformations to determine the mechanical stress resulting from the interaction of the stent with the artery. A comparison of each of the 5 stents under identical conditions, including a systematic study of the effects of age, diabetes and lesion calcification on these mechanical stresses, will allow identification of the optimal stet for the SFA and PA in patients with different clinical and lesion characteristics. The capability o our model to predict areas where restenosis will occur in the stented SFA/PA will for the first time be clinically validated in PAD patients by comparing the areas of high stress in the patient-specific models to the areas of restenosis visualized by CTA 6 months after stenting. The ability to rationally select patient and lesion-specific stents for the SFA and PA will produce more durable reconstructions and have an immediate direct translational impact benefiting PAD patients with claudication and critical limb ischemia. Our precise description of the human SFA and PA mechanical environments will greatly advance our knowledge of PAD pathophysiology and will allow the development of a better stent for the SFA and PA. By creating vital, currently unavailable computational model input data and taking the initial steps towards clinical validation, our study will serve as a foundation for larger-scale, more cost-effective in silico comparative effectiveness studies of current and future PAD stents and help advance the new paradigm of patient-specific modeling and medicine."
"9606537","The goal of the proposed project, Health and Wellbeing Impact of Contamination of Traditional Food and Water  on the Navajo, is to determine health risks and community impacts (e.g., consumption issues, threats to cultural  values, spiritual concerns, and public health impacts) from exposure to environmental uranium and arsenic  contamination of traditional food and water for Navajo communities. The approach for this project is to utilize a  community-engaged research model to explore exposure pathways and to identify culturally applicable and  community-constructed models for mitigation of the impact of the identified chemical contaminants on Navajo  communities. An outcome of this project is the development of a model that will support culturally relevant and  community-created policy with respect to contaminated traditional foods and water that will be scalable to other  Native American communities, and potentially beyond those communities to other environmentally impacted  cultural communities. The Specific Aims of the proposed project are to: 1) Characterize the extent of metal  contamination in culturally significant food and water sources for two Navajo communities; 2) Model dietary  metal exposure and utilize the Indigenous Health Indicator to assess health impact; and 3) Develop a  Community-Participatory Multi-Level Policy Intervention Model. Uranium associated with abandoned uranium  mines and arsenic in traditional food such as sheep as well as water are a major concern to the Navajo. Aim 1  will determine the extent of contamination in the food and water sources of the two Navajo communities.  Following initial characterization of metal contamination, field work with subsequent chemical analysis is  proposed. Aim 2 will focus on collecting a dietary history of individuals in the Navajo communities to model  uranium and arsenic exposure through consumption of traditional foods and water. Community level socio-  cultural public health pathways will be identified and evaluated. The physiological exposure pathways and  socio-cultural significance will be integrated in a culturally relevant and effective impact assessment model  called the Indigenous Health Indicator (IHI) developed by Swinomish tribal environmental health workers. In  Aim 3, results from Aims 1 and 2 will be utilized to develop a culturally-relevant policy focused on  contamination of traditional Native American foods. We are proposing to deploy a culturally directed,  empirically tested model that will allow Native American communities to establish (and assess) culturally  applicable environmental health interventions. It will be important in the policy work to consult with the  Traditional Knowledge Holders from the tribes to best shape policies around traditional food consumption. We  believe that this approach will result in policy that other Native American tribes can adapt to address  contamination of traditional foods in their communities."
"9448094","Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is quite common and often leads to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) with the resultant need for renal replacement therapy. Micro-albuminuria, proteinuria, hyper-filtration, and impaired renal function occur with obesity, suggesting that excess renal lipids, particularly free fatty acids (FFAs), may directly injure and/or indirectly damage the kidneys via increased oxidative stress and inflammation. An excess of renal lipids can damage renal tubule cells. Immune inflammatory pathways can induce oxidative stress, resulting in podocyte injury and protein deposition in the extracellular matrix of the nephron.  Using two different murine models of renal disease associated with obesity, we have discovered that retinoic acid receptor ?2 (RAR?2) agonists protect kidneys against lipotoxicity. RAR?2 is a member of a family of nuclear transcription factors that are activated by retinoids (derivatives and metabolites of vitamin A (retinol). We hypothesize that renal lipid accumulation is a key contributor to dysfunction in both the glomerular and tubular compartments and that this excess renal lipid accumulation can be prevented or reversed through the use of highly selective agonists of RAR?2. A corollary to this hypothesis is that renal dysfunction may be reversed by this RAR?2 agonist. We will test this hypothesis in three aims: in Specific Aim (1), we will test (in pre-clinical drug efficacy studies) selective RAR?2 agonists (AC261066, AC55649) to determine if these synthetic retinoids can (a) decrease the lipid deposition in the kidneys and (b) improve or stabilize kidney function in obesity-induced chronic kidney disease, indicating that these drugs could potentially be used to treat human patients who present with CKD associated with obesity. We will use two murine models, a high fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity model and db/db mice, a genetic model of obesity-associated CKD. In Specific Aim (2), we will explore the molecular mechanism(s) by which RAR?2 agonists reduce lipid accumulation and renal inflammation in these mouse models. Aim (2) will also test whether the RAR?2 agonists are acting via RAR?2 expressed in particular types of cells in the kidney through the use of renal cell type specific RAR? knockout mice. In Specific Aim (3), we will use cell culture models to ascertain if RAR?2 agonists act on podocytes, mesangial cells, and/ or proximal tubule cells via the RAR?2 receptor.  Selective RAR?2 agonists have not been tested for treatment of obesity-induced CKD. Thus, our proposed research may define a specific, novel drug target and identify new drugs that treat, and even prevent obesity- associated nephropathy or, possibly, other types of CKD. The strengths of our application include our published work showing that the RAR?2 agonists inhibit the development of renal and hepatic steatosis in genetic and dietary obesity-induced murine disease models; the unique reagents in our possession, such as the conditional knockout RAR? mice; and our research team at Weill Cornell that includes researchers with considerable experience in retinoid pharmacology, mouse models, and renal histology and pathology."
"9385706","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): It is estimated that up to 20% of American adults suffer from sleep apnea with an increased risk of developing hypertension and vascular dysfunction. We have observed that simulating sleep apnea in rats by exposing them to intermittent hypoxia (IH) during sleep also increases blood pressure, augments constrictor sensitivity and impairs endothelial dilation. These vascular changes appear to be due in part to loss of the synthesis of the vasodilator, hydrogen sulfide (H2S). Proposed studies will evaluate the mechanisms of H2S- induced vasodilation and determine how IH exposure impairs H2S signaling to impair vasodilation. H2S is a recently described vasodilator produced in the vasculature by cystathionine gamma-lyase (CSE). H2S hyperpolarizes and relaxes vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) but much is still unknown about where, when and how it acts. Genetic deletion of CSE in mice elevates blood pressure and impairs endothelium- dependent dilation supporting its role as an important regulator of the vasculature. Our recent studies reveal that H2S causes vasodilation by activating large-conductance calcium-sensitive potassium channels (BKCa) in endothelial cells, eBK. This autocrine effect of H2S has not previously been investigated and is the focus of this proposal. CSE expression in EC is regulated by the transcription factor, NFATc3 and our data suggest IH decreases NFATc3 activation in EC leading to decreased CSE expression and impaired H2S- induced dilation. Our long term goal is to define H2S signaling in the vascular wall, to understand its regulation during intermittent hypoxia and to clarify its role in normal and pathological vascular function. The guiding hypothesis for the proposed studies that H2S activates eBK to mediate dilation and that IH disrupts this pathway by decreasing CSE expression. The first Aim of the project is to evaluate H2S activation of K+ channels in endothelial cells. The second Aim is to define the mechanism IH-induced decreases in CSE-dependent vasodilation expression. The third Aim is to Evaluate H2S regulation of blood flow in renal, mesenteric and hindquarters vascular beds determine how IH alters the regulation to contribute to elevated blood pressure. Together the proposed studies will define H2S signaling at molecular, tissue and whole animal levels to increase our understanding of how H2S contributes to cardiovascular control. Defining the causes of dysregulated H2S signaling in IH-exposed rats will also provide a rational basis for the future development of therapies targeting to effectively treat hypertension and peripheral vascular disease in the sleep apnea population."
"9397557","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Coronary artery disease (CAD) is a worldwide leading cause of heart attacks, death and disability, and leads to billions of dollars of healthcar expenditures each year. Clinically, a widely effective interventional treatment for CAD is percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) using coronary metal stents. Over 1 million coronary stents are placed annually in the US alone. Yet, two complications can limit the benefit of coronary stents: restenosis (scarring), and thrombosis (clotting). Prevention of plaque progression and stent complications would eliminate hundreds of thousands of invasive catheterizations, heart attacks, and deaths each year.  Biologically, inflammation underlies all of these diseases: atherosclerosis, stent restenosis, and stent thrombosis. Yet the in vivo mechanisms by which inflammation drives plaques progression and the injury response to stenting remains poorly understood. The ability to quantitatively image inflammation in vivo, especially with translatable technology, could provide clinically relevant, vital new insights into these disorders. To address this unmet need, our laboratory is developing coronary artery-targeted intravascular near-infrared fluorescence (NIRF) molecular imaging approaches to image and quantify arterial inflammation and stent healing. Most recently we have developed an early-stage intravascular NIRF-optical frequency domain imaging (OFDI, Nature Medicine 2011; 17:1680-4) system to quantitatively image molecular signals in the context of arterial structure.  The objective of this Proposal is to develop translatable intravascular NIRF-OFDI molecular-microstructural imaging approaches to better understand mechanisms of plaque progression and stent complications. This Proposal tests the central hypothesis that integrated NIRF-OFDI will comprehensively assess the role of in vivo inflammation in driving plaque progression, stent restenosis, and stent thrombosis. Our long-term goal is to assess inflammatory mechanisms in human coronary arteries and to ultimately reduce the immense burden of CAD and stent complications. The Specific Aims of this proposal are: Specific Aim 1. To engineer a next-generation intravascular NIRF-OFDI 2.9F catheter system. Specific Aim 2. To determine how plaque inflammation modulates atheroma progression and stent restenosis. Specific Aim 3. To determine how plaque inflammation modulates stent healing and risk of stent thrombosis. This research will transform the field of atherosclerosis and coronary stenting by (1) providing new, valuable pathobiological knowledge about the role of inflammation in regulating atheroma progression, restenosis, and stent malhealing; and (2) provide translatable strategies for inflammation-structural imaging, to ultimately improve the outcomes of patients with CAD and those undergoing coronary stenting."
"9397410","Aging and age related co-morbidities are major risk factors for neurological pathologies. As the population ages, this puts a major strain on public health. One population that is particularly at risk in the United States are human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) infected individuals as more than half of the population is now 50 years of age or older. Infected individuals show signs of premature aging and are prone to neurological dysfunctions collectively known as HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND). The persistence of HAND has been troubling since with the advent of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), the virus is sufficiently suppressed. Possible contributors to HAND therefore include the HAART drugs themselves as well as reservoirs of the gp120 viral envelope protein hidden in the CNS. Since advancing age is critical for HAND, it is likely that there is an interaction between aging and the factors that influence HAND pathology. We propose that an age associated stress response in astrocytes known as cellular senescence in response to HAART drugs and gp120 could be a contributor to HAND. We will examine the senescence-associated DNA damage response, telomere damage and oxidative stress pathways activated in response to these stimuli. Since senescence is accompanied by the secretion of pro-inflammatory proteins known as the senescence- associated secretory phenotype, we will also determine the contribution of senescent astrocytes to inflammation in response to these HIV-associated stimuli. We will also determine which signaling mechanisms contribute to the secretions by using pharmacological inhibitors of major inflammatory centers. Neurons are also sensitive to glial activation and their toxicity in response to activated glia are another possible HAND contributor. We will examine if secretions from HIV-associated senescent astrocyte are able to cause neurotoxicity and whether pharmacological inhibition of inflammation can mitigate this response. Our overall objective is to determine the interaction between aging and HIV-associated factors as a contributor to HAND. Since many age associated pathologies are associated with the accumulation of senescent cells, astrocyte senescence in response to HAART drugs and gp120 could be a major contributor to HAND and Inhibition of this response could be a public health boon as a potential therapy."
"9605388","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death and morbidity for individuals with spinal cord injury (SCI). The risk for cardiovascular disease is exacerbated by systemic low grade inflammation as well as abnormal and unstable cardiac and autonomic control. The enhanced inflammation is expected to be due to an attenuated cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway (CAP). The CAP is an endogenous, physiological mechanism by which acetylcholine from the vagus nerve interacts with the innate immune system to modulate and restrain the inflammatory cascade and promote the reparative process. Accordingly, vagal plasticity, following mid-thoracic SCI (T5X), is expected to attenuate the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway and enhance inflammatory responses. Furthermore, the vagal plasticity, associated with SCI, is expected to be a response to pressure and volume unloading as a result of the rapid and sustained reduction in both arterial pressure and end-diastolic volume, secondary to the loss of sympathetic vasoconstrictor tone below the level of the injury. The pressure and volume unloading, is expected to unload arterial baroreceptors with resultant reduced cardiac parasympathetic activity and enhanced cardiac sympathetic activity, which causes cardiac, autonomic and immune dysfunction and structural remodeling. Finally, external lower body compression, by increasing plasma volume, arterial pressure, left ventricular pressure and cardiac output, is expected to maintain contractile function, load arteria baroreceptors and enhance cardiac parasympathetic activity and reduce cardiac sympathetic activity. As a result, cardiac dysfunction and autonomic remodeling are prevented. Furthermore, the enhanced parasympathetic (vagal) tonus is expected to augment the cholinergic anti- inflammatory pathway and attenuate inflammatory responses, and improve post-infarct cardiac remodeling. Therefore, the proposed studies are designed to test the following hypotheses: 1) External lower body compression increases plasma volume, left ventricular pressure, arterial pressure and cardiac output in conscious T5X mice. Consequently, arterial baroreceptors are loaded and enhance cardiac parasympathetic activity and reduce cardiac sympathetic activity. 2) External lower body compression, by normalizing cardiac autonomic control, prevents cardiac and autonomic structural and functional remodeling. 3) External lower body compression, by normalizing cardiac vagal control, reduces infarct expansion by attenuating the inflammatory response following myocardial ischemia/reperfusion and infarction in conscious mice. 4) Finally the responses to external lower body compression] are mediated via the ?7 subunit of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor. The results from this proposal, using a unique model and innovative telemetric approaches for recording physiological events, have the potential to impact the lives of thousands of individuals and families living with SCI by harnessing endogenous homeostatic control systems to correct autonomic and immune dysfunction with a simple and easily administered therapeutic intervention."
"9442495","Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is the most common malignancy among children and young adolescents. More than 90% of children are cured with a combination of multiple chemotherapeutic drugs. Some may suffer from debilitating toxicities due to the cytotoxic drugs, necessitating pharmacogenetic research to search for genetic markers predictive of treatment toxicities, so that treatment can be better tailored based on patients? genetic makeup. Bone toxicities, including osteonecrosis and fractures, most often due to glucocorticoids, are the most common complications in ALL, which have long-lasting detrimental impact on the still developing skeletons in children. In DFCI ALL Consortium Protocol 05-001, a multi-center clinical trial for childhood ALL conducted in Canada and the US, we found that Hispanic children had less drug toxicities to their bones than non-Hispanic children. Although reasons for the observed ethnic differences are largely unknown, patients? inherited genetic background may be at play. This R03 grant seeks to perform a novel pharmacogenomic study based on 05-001 and its successor trial DFCI 11-001 to identify genetic underpinnings of ethnic disparities in bone toxicities. We plan to first test global genetic ancestry with bone toxicities, followed by a bivariate genome-wide association study (GWAS) to jointly analyze osteonecrosis and fracture as two related traits. This approach has been proven to be highly effective in ascertainment of genetic causes of ethnic disparities and further identification of related genes and loci. Specifically, we propose the following four Aims. Aim 1. Determine whether the composition of genetic ancestry in Hispanic children is an underlying cause for the ethnic disparities in therapy-related bone toxicities, namely osteonecrosis and fracture, in children with ALL in the DFCI 05-001 and 11-001 trials. Aim 2. a). Investigate single variants and polygenic risk scores from previous GWAS of bone-related phenotypes with bone toxicities in children treated for ALL; b). Identify genetic loci associated with therapy-related bone toxicities by performing bivariate GWAS analyses with directional alignment and meta-analysis in the DFCI 05-001 and 11-001 trials; c). Investigate whether genetic variants and polygenic scores significant in 2a and 2b explain disparities in bone toxicities between Hispanic and non- Hispanic children with ALL. Pharmacogenetic and pharmacogenomic research in childhood ALL has been remarkably successful and highly rewarding in identifying risk variants with large effect size for treatment outcomes and toxicities based on patient populations of relatively small sample size. This is likely due to high susceptibility of children to cytotoxic effects of chemotherapeutic drugs and thus much larger effect size each variant carries. Our study will be the first to focus on ethnic disparities in bone toxicities for children treated for ALL. We expect to elucidate genetic mechanisms underlying the ethnic disparities in therapy-related bone toxicities between Hispanic and non-Hispanic children with ALL. The identified risk variants may have translational significance to guide the treatment for children with ALL."
"9398151","ABSTRACT  End stage renal disease (ESRD) requiring hemodialysis (HD) affects >400,000 patients in the US and is associated with high morbidity, mortality, and costs. While HD can prevent immediate death due to uremia, the long-term survival of patients on HD remains poor. Median survival from the time of initiating HD is 3 years and 5-year survival is <35%. Over 50% of all deaths in HD patients are due to cardiovascular disease (CVD) and 50% of these (25% of all deaths) are sudden cardiac deaths (SCD). The high rates of SCD in HD patients have not changed in recent decades. The key barrier to progress in reducing SCD rates in HD patients is our limited understanding of the mechanisms underlying SCD. It has been assumed that the arrhythmic mechanisms for SCD in HD were the same as in the general population and that the majority of cases were due to ventricular tachycardia / ventricular fibrillation (VT/VF), but other mechanisms have also been described in HD including bradyarrhythmias, asystole and non-arrhythmic events. Little is known regarding the prevalence of these mechanisms in HD and this is widely recognized as a major clinical challenge. In addition, several characteristics of the HD session may contribute to arrhythmic risk. The typical dialysate prescription, low in potassium and calcium and high in bicarbonate concentrations, and rapid fluid shifts and hypotension during HD may further increase the risk of arrhythmias. Previous studies of arrhythmic risk in HD patients have been limited by the lack of continuous cardiac monitoring or by small sample sizes.  We propose to conduct the Cardiac Arrhythmia Monitoring and Related Outcomes in HD (CAMARO- HD) Study, a cohort study of the risk of developing cardiac arrhythmias and their associated outcomes among 1,000 patients recruited within the first 6 months of initiating HD. We will implant a subcutaneous cardiac monitor (Reveal LINQ) in each patient to continuously record the cardiac rhythm and identify all episodes of VT/VF, bradycardia, asystole, and atrial fibrillation during 3 years of follow-up. We will then evaluate the association of arrhythmic events and arrhythmic burden with study outcomes (all-cause mortality and heart failure hospitalization). CAMARO-HD will also test the hypothesis that specific characteristics of the HD session contribute to arrhythmic risk and will assess if differences in arrhythmic burden between Black and White patients mediate the well-known race-survival paradox in HD.  CAMARO-HD will be the largest cohort of HD patients with long-term continuous cardiac monitoring and precise information on ventricular and atrial arrhythmic episodes with a sample size large enough to quantify their clinical consequences in terms of mortality and heart failure hospitalization. CAMARO-HD will also provide actionable information related to the arrhythmic mechanisms responsible for deaths or heart failure hospitalizations and to the association of specific characteristics of the HD session with arrhythmic events. This information will directly modify clinical practice and will inform the design of preventive trials."
"9391191","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In recent decades there has been a marked decline in morbidity and mortality from coronary heart disease (CHD) in the US. But the strength of this trend varies across demographic groups. Those of low socioeconomic status (SES) continue to develop, and die from, CHD at rates more typical of the 1970's. Most research on the origins of these disparities focuses on middle stages of the lifespan, when CHD manifests clinically. While this research has been fruitful, shifting the focus towards earlier life stages could yield valuabl insights. Many pathogenic mechanisms that give rise to CHD begin in childhood, and by adolescence increasing numbers of American youth display risk factors for and preclinical signs of CHD, which themselves pattern by SES. Despite these findings, relatively little attention has been directed towards early CHD disparities. We know little about why they emerge and how they unfold developmentally. To address these questions, we propose a prospective, multilevel study of 250 youth from economically diverse backgrounds. Subjects will be enrolled during eighth grade and reassessed in tenth grade. Drawing on hypotheses from a recently developed conceptual framework, the study poses three questions about SES disparities in immunologic, neural, and psychosocial development, and the implications for early CHD risk. First, we ask whether SES relates to maturation patterns in the immune system, with a focus on inflammatory processes that underlie CHD. We expect low-SES youth to display a multilayer inflammatory phenotype, which manifests at the genomic, cellular, and systemic levels of analyses. Second, we ask whether SES relates to maturation patterns in the brain's corticolimbic and corticostriatal circuitries, and thereby give rise to behavioral proclivities that heighten CHD risk. Using high-dimensional structural imaging and diffusion tensor imaging, we expect low SES to be associated with disparities in grey- and white-matter development in these circuitries. These disparities should, in turn, presage CHD-relevant behavioral proclivities, including threat vigilance, social turmoil, poor self-regulation, and unhealthy lifestyles. Finally, noting that som low-SES youth have positive health outcomes, we explore characteristics and experiences that bend the normative demographic curve. We expect that lower-SES youth who encounter positive social influences - specifically role models and high maternal warmth - will develop a suite of personal resources - trust, emotion regulation skills, and self-esteem - that help them navigate the challenges of high school and low-SES life more broadly. Those resources will shift low-SES youth off their expected risk trajectory, resulting in immune and neural patterns similar to higher-SES youth."
"9405902","The use of aerosolized nicotine products, mostly electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS), are growing in popularity and especially among younger individuals who have not necessarily used tobacco products previously. We know little about the impact this has on their future health landscape. Challenges to our understanding of the unique concerns ENDS present to health include their highly variable and inconsistent formulations. Despite this variability, ENDS share in common the delivery of the biologically active component nicotine, which is present in relatively high purity and concentration. This proposal will focus on examining the biologic effects of nicotine that are unique to delivery by aerosolization (aeroNic) and inhalation. Our group has studied the impact of nicotine on both peripheral immune and central processes leading to addiction since the original cloning of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChR). Because the effects of nicotine are highly dependent upon its route of delivery, we have first developed a reliable method of aeroNic administration to the mouse that produces quantitative uptake and kinetics comparable to those in humans. The experimental focus will apply this AeroNic delivery system to define its impact on mouse inflammatory stasis in the lung and gastrointestinal (GI) tract, and determine how this modifies the inflammatory response to challenge of the lung by either acute lung injury (ALI) or to allergic eosinophilic inflammation (AEI; a model of asthma). This analysis will be greatly facilitated through application of genetic tools that manipulate signaling through nicotine's principal target in peripheral cells, the nAChRalpha7 (?7). This includes how nicotine couples to specific calcium signaling networks to modulate these pro-inflammatory responses. In preliminary studies, aeroNic actions through ?7 calcium-coupled mechanisms in the lung reduce inflammatory responsiveness and alter epithelial cell signaling networks such as those controlling mucin production. Most recently we have discovered a concurrent and robust impact by aeroNic on microbiota dysbiosis. The experiments proposed build upon these preliminary and published findings to test the project hypothesis: Aerosolized nicotine acts to depress lung responsiveness to ALI and to AEI through modifying ?7 calcium signaling networks controlling normal modulation of immune - epithelial - microbiota interactions. This will be tested in experiments outlined in three interactive Specific aims. Aim 1 will measure how aeroNic alters the mouse microbiota and if dysbiosis is permanent. Aim 2 will define transcriptional signaling networks and proteomic mechanisms through which aeroNic acts through ?7 to modify normal epithelial cell function. Aim 3 will define how aeroNic modifies the lung/GI axis stasis through modifications of mucosal immune cells known to regulate both ALI and AEI. At the conclusion of these experiments we will have a clear understanding of the unique biological impact of aeroNic on the lung and GI and how these changes may modify long-term health outcomes."
"9390065","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Bacterial pneumonia and sepsis are leading preventable causes of death in the intensive care unit and Streptococcus pneumoniae (Sp) is a major etiology. Current therapies are mostly focused on the use of antibiotics and have led to the rapid emergence of drug resistance and hypervirulent strains. A fundamental aspect of successful pathogen-host interactions is the ability to keep harmful, tissue-damaging inflammatory immune responses in check while successfully clearing the pathogen. The exaggerated morbidity and mortality seen with bacterial infection can be the result of dysregulated inflammation. There are currently no viable therapeutic modalities to augment host defense while reducing unnecessary inflammation. Further, it is poorly understood how signaling cascades converge to control host defenses while minimizing inflammatory tissue injury. With this in mind, we have identified Chitinase 3-like 1 (Chi3l1), a prototypic Chitinase-like protein of 18- glycosyl hydrolase family, to be important in this process. We find that Chi3l1 is a potent innate immune regulator elevated in patients with diseases characterized by inflammation and tissue repair. Chi3l1, along with its newly discovered receptor IL13RD2, is induced during Sp infection and is critical in antibacterial responses. The Chi3l1-IL13RD2 axis is important as a therapeutic target for controlling potentially harmful innate immune activation during bacterial infection. Our data show that the Chi3l1-IL13RD2 interaction critically dampens potentially harmful type I interferon (IFN-1) responses during infection. The absence of Chi3l1 or IL13RD2 results in heightened IFN-1s during infection associated with increased co-localization of endosomal Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) and interferon regulatory factor 7 (IRF7). Our overall hypothesis is that the Chi3l1-IL13RD2 dampens excessive inflammation and tissue injury by regulating IFN-1 pathway. We will test this hypothesis with the following specific aims: Specific Aim 1. Characterize the mechanisms by which Chi3l1 and its receptor IL13RD2 regulate IFN-1 production and signaling in a murine model of bacterial infection. Specific Aim 2. Examine the role of Chi3l1 and IL13RD2 in the regulation of endosomal trafficking of TLR9 during bacterial infection in vitro and in a mouse model. Specific Aim 3. Determine which cells are critically required for Chi3l1 and IFN-1 production during infection, and determine the clinical significance of Chi3l1 and IFN-1 in bacterial infection. This project aims to understand the mechanisms of pathogen-related immunopathology during bacterial infection, including the mechanisms by which Chi3l1 modulates the IFN-1 response to control immunopathology. We will also explore the role of Chi3l1 in endosomal trafficking of TLRs during infection and assess the use of Chi3l1 as a prognostic biomarker in infected patients. The data generated from this application are expected to provide novel insights that promote the development of new therapies for bacterial infection."

"9387399","Project Summary/Abstract  The Tumor Microenvironment Program at USC Norris was created in 2003. The concept behind this Program  is that the fundamental investigation of the mechanisms that control the interaction between malignant cells  and their nontransformed microenvironment should lead to the identification of novel targets for therapeutic  intervention and better prognosticators. The overarching goal is to make innovative basic discoveries on the  role of the tumor microenvironment (TME), and by interacting with other Programs of USC Norris, develop  these discoveries into investigator-driven clinical trials. The Program has three scientific objectives: 1) to  investigate the fundamental mechanisms of communication between cancer cells and their microenvironment;  2) to understand the contribution of viral-induced lymphangiogenesis/angiogenesis to Kaposi sarcoma; and 3)  to understand the mechanisms of immune escape and develop new approaches to cancer immunotherapy.  The Program Co-Leaders Yves DeClerck and Martin Kast have complementary recognized expertise in the  tumor microenvironment and in immunotherapy, respectively. The Program brings together 28 members from  16 departments in four schools at USC with expertise and research interests in inflammation, tumor-stroma  interaction, metastasis, angiogenesis, Kaposi sarcoma-associated Herpes Virus (KSHV), human papilloma  virus (HPV)-mediated oncogenesis, and immunotherapy. The Program has obtained new funding in the tumor  microenvironment (one U54, three R01s, one DoD) and in viral-mediated angiogenesis/lymphangiogenesis  (one P01 and one R21). A unique aspect of this basic science program has been its commitment to translation.  Over the last five years, the Program has been the hub where fundamental observations made by its members  have led to nine clinical studies/trials. Research conducted by members of the Program has a unique impact  on specific populations of the LA County catchment area, particularly children (neuroblastoma and childhood  ALL), women of low economic status (HPV-induced cervical cancer), and HIV-infected patients (Kaposi  sarcoma).

"9405531","Genetic counseling or Cancer Genetic Risk Assessment (CGRA) for hereditary breast and ovarian cancer (HBOC) is an evidence-based precision medicine strategy that facilitates informed decision making about effective health management options. Identification of individuals at increased risk of HBOC is crucial for cancer survivors and their families to benefit from biomedical advances in cancer prevention, early detection, treatment and survivorship. Although national guidelines for CGRA and genetic testing have been available for two decades, only one-third or less of high-risk women have accessed these services. The optimal risk assessment strategy starts with an individual with an HBOC-related cancer. Widespread dissemination and adoption of national guidelines for informed decision-making and promoting CGRA is needed to achieve a population-level reduction in cancer morbidity, mortality and disparities. Thus, it is important to promote access to CGRA, particularly in medically underserved populations. The proposed Genetic Risk Assessment for Cancer Education and Empowerment (GRACE) Project seeks to address this important translational gap by developing and implementing strategies to promote guideline-based care in the Rocky Mountain region where there are distinguishable disparities in CGRA utilization by ethnicity and geography. Remarkably, few intervention studies have been conducted to address the regional and national translational gap in CGRA utilization for these diverse populations, underscoring our study's high impact and innovative public health intervention delivery approach. The GRACE Project is guided by evidenced-based behavior change counseling strategies to promote risk-based care delivery and reduce disparities that consider individual, cultural, social and system-level factors. The study's primary aim is to test the comparative effectiveness of mailed targeted print (TP) vs. TP plus a telephone-based tailored counseling and navigation intervention (TCN) vs. usual care (UC) to increase guideline-based CGRA for HBOC. We will oversample Hispanics and rural dwellers and enroll 1206 high-risk female cancer survivors. Women will be recruited through the Colorado and New Mexico cancer registries and meet the criteria for a CGRA referral. Enrollees will be randomized to one of 3 study arms and complete baseline, 1-month, 6-month and 12-month surveys. Specific aims are to: 1) compare the effectiveness of a targeted intervention (TP) vs. a tailored (TPC) intervention vs. usual care (UC) on CGRA utilization 6 months (primary outcome) after the intervention and at 12 months, after removal of key access barriers; 2) compare the effectiveness of the interventions on genetic testing utilization; 3) examine potential underlying theoretical mediating and moderating mechanisms that will further specify and elucidate significant intervention effects; and 4) compare the cost effectiveness of the interventions vs. usual care, for utilization of CGRA services. If effective, either or both interventions have the potential to reach a large number of high-risk families and reduce disparities through broad dissemination."
"9453851","PROJECT SUMMARY Bacterial pathogens and their infectious sequelae remain a huge burden on the health care system, sickening millions in developed countries and killing tens of millions (often children) in developing countries. Many clinically relevant bacterial pathogens establish an intracellular niche in order to replicate, survive and/or persist within the host. These intracellular bacteria either occupy a membrane-bound vacuole or lyse their nascent phagosome to live freely within the cytosol. The fundamental processes governing intracellular niche selection are poorly understood. Here we propose to fill this knowledge gap and investigate whether a key virulence determinant to Gram-negative bacteria, the type III secretion system (T3SS), directs the intracellular lifestyle of pathogenic bacteria. The T3SS or injectisome, is a complex needle-like nanomachine anchored in the bacterial membrane that acts as a conduit for the passage of bacterial effectors directly into the host cell. Contact of the needle tip with host cell membranes, specifically the plasma membrane and endocytic bacteria- containing vacuole membrane, triggers the formation of a membrane-spanning translocon pore. Two bacterial proteins, known as translocators, oligomerize to form this pore. We have found that replacing the gene encoding a translocator protein in the vacuolar bacterium, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (STm), with its ortholog from a cytosolic bacterium, either Shigella flexneri or Chromobacterium violaceum, allows STm to proficiently lyse its nascent vacuole and colonize the cytosol. Based upon these findings, we hypothesize that intrinsic properties of the translocator proteins define the efficiency of bacteria-containing vacuole lysis, and therefore the intracellular niche occupied by Gram-negative pathogens. We will test our hypothesis by pursuing two Specific Aims. First, we will determine whether translocator proteins from cytosolic bacteria have greater intrinsic membrane-destabilizing activity than those from vacuolar bacteria. Here we will genetically replace translocator proteins in a vacuolar (STm) and cytosolic (C. violaceum) pathogen with orthologs from other members of the Inv/Mxi-Spa T3SS family and measure the effect on bacteria-containing vacuole lysis. We will also construct translocator chimeras to identify functional regions that define their phagolytic properties. Second, we will identify whether the translocon itself or type III effector activities of the translocator proteins account for differential bacteria-containing vacuole lysis. Our proposed studies will specifically address the role of type III translocators in phagosomal membrane lysis. This will improve our understanding of the pathogenic mechanisms utilized by bacteria to colonize host cells, and could aid in the rational design of therapeutics against the T3SS injectisome, which is shared by many clinically relevant Gram- negative pathogens."
"9410322","PROJECT SUMMARY This application focuses on utilization of environmental enrichment (EE) to attenuate the effects of perinatal hypoxia (HX) on the developing brain. Hypoxic damage to the brain is often sustained as a consequence of preterm birth, and results in cognitive and behavioral disabilities throughout childhood and beyond. This oxygenation failure predisposes preterm infants to white matter (WM) injury, resulting in the loss of oligodendrocyte (OL) glial cells and therefore myelination. One promising non-invasive therapy for promoting recovery after perinatal HX is EE - a combination of social and physical enhancement of surroundings that provides mammals with more complex social interactions, exposure to novel stimuli, and an opportunity for voluntary physical activity. Previous studies have demonstrated that the environment affects neural plasticity and functional recovery after brain injury, and that social, family, and environmental factors can improve cognitive outcome in premature children. This suggests that the environment can be used as a modulator of recovery in premature brain injury, and may enhance the endogenous repair of developing WM after HX insult to restore WM-dependent behavioral function. To test this hypothesis, the effects of EE on cellular, ultrastructural, and functional recovery after HX will be determined using a rodent model of perinatal HX. First, the critical neurodevelopmental window and individual components of EE required for OL recovery after HX will be defined. Then, using genetic manipulations in conditional loss of function mice, the role of EE-induced de novo myelination after HX will be determined. The proposed study utilizes a novel approach to enhance recovery from WM injury in the brain during critical periods of neurodevelopment, and importantly, will aid in the development of new therapeutic strategies to reduce the long-term neurologic sequelae of preterm birth."

Rare genetic variants are an important component of disease risk and a full understanding of genetic architecture will require studies of hundreds of thousands - perhaps millions - of individuals. Study design, including ethnic diversity and pedigrees, and leveraging phenotypes proximal to the gene level will be critical for early success. Across three Discovery Projects, we will generate 50,000 whole genome sequences in well-phenotyped individuals to study disorders of the cardiovascular system, bone and metabolism. These projects will utilize Illumina HiSeq X instruments and the world-class analysis and informatics pipelines at Baylor College of Medicine's Human Genome Sequencing Center. Methods for investigating noncoding variation, including long-read haplotypes and structural variation, will be given particular attention throughout. The discovery projects will be followed by replication studies in even larger numbers, and a case-cohort strategy will aggregate these data as a prelude to a comprehensive experiment based on recruitment of patients via large health care networks. These prospective collections are a first step toward realizing precision medicine."
"9398145","ABSTRACT More than half of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) develop hypertension (HTN), which doubles their risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD). Even though it is well known that insulin resistance and chronic inflammation lead to HTN and accelerate vascular disease in patients with T2DM, very little is known about the mechanisms by which these risk factors promote HTN and CVD. Vitamin D deficiency in patients with T2DM is almost twice that of non-diabetics, and most of the randomized clinical trials evaluating vitamin D supplementation in uncomplicated T2DM have demonstrated BP reductions, suggesting a possible effect in this population. Thus, the goal of this application is to identify the molecular mechanisms by which vitamin D deficiency promotes HTN in the setting of T2DM. Our preliminary data indicates that mice with macrophage- specific deletion of the VDR (KODMAC) were hypertensive with increased systemic renin, activation of the macrophage renin angiotensin system (RAS) in the aorta, and renal macrophage infiltration into the juxtaglomerular (JG) apparatus, the main source of renin production. Peritoneal macrophages from KODMAC or their media activated JG cell renin production via macrophage secretion of miR106b. This effect was blunted by lack of macrophage ER stress-regulated (C/EBP) homologous protein (CHOP). Similar effects were found with macrophages from vitamin D-deficient mice or from vitamin D-deficient patients with T2DM. Thus, we hypothesize that vitamin D-deficient macrophages increase systemic renin and hypertension in T2DM via increased secretion of miR-106b, stimulating renin secretion by JG cells, and/or via macrophage RAS-dependent mechanism. To test this hypothesis, Aim 1 will determine whether bone marrow (BM) transplant from miR-106b-/- or CHOP-/- into vitamin D-deficient mice improves HTN and decreases systemic renin. In Aim 2, we will evaluate whether BM transplant from Renin 1c-/- into vitamin D-deficient mice improves HTN and decreases systemic renin. In Aim 3, we will also assess the role of these inflammatory mechanisms of HTN in patients with T2DM and vitamin D deficiency by correlating changes in plasma miR-106b levels with changes in blood pressure after vitamin D supplementation (Aim 3a) and by testing whether monocytes or serum from vitamin D-deficient diabetics with HTN induce JG cell renin secretion via miR-106b (Aim 3b). This proposal will identify the mechanisms by which vitamin D deficiency regulates the innate immune system to induce systemic renin production and HTN in type 2 diabetes and thus, provide new therapeutic targets for these pervasive diseases.

"9391700","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Here we seek to understand how genetic and environmental factors jointly influence the risk of developing two highly co-morbid neuropsychiatric disorders, Tourette's Syndrome (TS) and Obsessive- Compulsive Disorder (OCD). These disorders are of major public health importance owing to their profound personal and societal costs. Little is known for certain about their etiology, and treatment, detection and prevention strategies are not optimal or directed by knowledge of pathophysiology. In other psychiatric disorders (e.g., schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and autism), genomics has begun to deliver fundamental knowledge about genetic architecture, identify specific loci for biological follow-up and localize pathways altered in disease. We intend to realize these same advances for TS and OCD by markedly increasing the worldwide sample size for genomic analysis of both disorders, in a first step toward elucidating the fundamental biology of these related conditions.  Four overlapping areas will be investigated in this project. First, we will discover genomic loci harboring common and rare variation associated with TS and OCD. We propose to quadruple the sample size of published TS and OCD genome-wide association studies (GWAS), in a rapid and cost-effective manner by utilizing archived blood spots from Denmark. Second, we will discover replicable structural variants (CNVs) associated with TS and OCD. Disease-associated CNVs are attractive causative mutations since, by altering gene dosage or structure, they provide a direction of effect and molecular mechanism. Third, we will identify shared genetic risk factors for TS, OCD and its major comorbidities. Here we test whether clinical comorbidity equates to genetic comorbidity. Finally, we will identify gene by environment interactions predisposing individuals to TS and OCD. We have access to a wealth of longitudinal medical registry data for every individual that will be genotyped in this study. This creates an extraordinary opportunity to identify gene by environment interactions. In sum, this project could add a high-impact understanding of how genetic and environmental factors jointly influence risk of TS and OCD, and lead to new mechanistic hypotheses."
"9396597","Abstract: Recent studies have exposed a new layer of dynamic complexity in DNA that can potentially redefine our basic view of the structure of DNA in vivo. NMR studies have shown that in canonical duplex DNA, G-C and A-T Watson-Crick base pairs exist in dynamic equilibrium with alternative Hoogsteen base pairs in which the purine flips 180 to form a new set of hydrogen bonds. There are now several documented examples in which Hoogsteen base pairs play crucial roles in DNA based transactions including damage induction, accommodation, and repair, replication, and sequence-specific DNA- protein recognition. Despite their growing importance, visualizing Hoogsteen base pairs in protein-DNA complexes remains an outstanding challenge in structural biology principally as they are very challenging to distinguish from Watson-Crick base pairs using X-ray crystallography. Indeed, we have obtained evidence that many Hoogsteen base pairs in high-resolution X-ray structures of DNA-protein complexes including the nucleosome may have been improperly modeled as Watson-Crick base pairs. This project will develop methods based on (IR) spectroscopy and site-specific modifications to allow the robust structural and functional characterization of Hoogsteen base pairs in large DNA-protein complexes. These methods will be used to test the hypothesis that the nucleosome particle is enriched with Hoogsteen base pairs that contribute to sequence-specific nucleosome stability. Aim 1 will use NMR and X-ray crystallography to determine IR signatures for Hoogsteen base pairs in model duplexes. Aim 2 will use IR and isotope-labeling to resolve suspected Hoogsteen base pairs in X-ray structures of the nucleosome core particle. Aim 3 will examine a broader range of nucleosome positioning sequences to determine how the Hoogsteen levels vary with sequence and will also assess the functional importance of these Hoogsteen base pairs by examining the impact of site- specific 7-deazopurine and ribonucleotide substitutions on nucleosome stability. !"
"9385748","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our proposal is based upon new and important findings involving changes in mitochondrial structure and function in cerebral arteries after ischemia which are of scientific interest because they overturn accepted thinking concerning mitochondrial status and function after ischemia. These findings are of translational interest because they open up novel therapeutic avenues which can be used in people following strokes. Our overall hypothesis, derived from our discoveries, is that naturally occurring and drug inducible changes in mitochondria, primarily in endothelium following ischemia, lead to improved cerebral vascular function, preserved blood-brain barrier, and reduced neurological injury. We find that mitochondria are more resiliant after ischemic insult than previously believed and thus represent a novel therapy in stroke patients. The stroke model we use induces patterns of cerebral vascular and brain injury similar to those seen in patients in which the vascular occlusion is not removed until 3 or more hours following the onset of stroke. Several studies have shown that tPA administration in a 3- to 4.5-hour window after stroke onset shows a modest therapeutic benefit with little benefit beyond 4.5 hours. These patients in the 3-4.5 hour post-onset period represent a large and extremely vulnerable population. We expect that mitochondrial targeting in addition to clot removal will lessen morbidity and mortality in these patients. We will test our hypothesis in cultured cerebral vascular endothelial cells, isolated cerebral arteries, and the in vivo cerebral circulation. Aim 1. Determination of naturally occurring morphological and functional changes in mitochondria in the cerebral vasculature following ischemic stress. We will test the hypothesis that structural changes in mitochondria, including size, numbers, and/or protein content, especially in endothelium, are correlated with functional changes involving maintained dilator and protective responses following ischemia. Aim 2. Determination of inducible changes in mitochondrial dynamics in the cerebral vasculature following ischemic stress. We will test the hypothesis that pharmacologically-induced post-conditioning will further improve upon natural mitochondrial-dependent processes in the cerebral circulation following ischemia."
"9590497","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): High dosage of early intervention is critical to language skill development in young children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) (Dawson et al., 2010) and including parents is a cost-effective approach to maximize intervention dosage. However, parent-mediated interventions have inconsistent effects on parent and child outcomes (Oono, Honey, & McConachie, 2013). This variability is likely because parents do not have the same training as clinicians and little effort has been spent examining parent characteristics that may influence their ability to implement different types of intervention strategies. Given the known cognitive, personality and language features (Broad Autism Phenotype, BAP) present among many parents of children with ASD, examining the relationship between BAP traits in parents and their implementation of different parent-mediated intervention strategies is an important first step in identifying potential sources of variability in parent-mediated interventio outcomes. The objective of the proposed study is to examine how BAP traits influence parent use of language intervention strategies and subsequent child language skills. The central hypothesis is that the parental BAP traits will be associated with: (a) differential use of languag intervention strategies and (b) child language skills. The specific aims include determining the extent to which: (a) BAP traits and type of parent-mediated intervention are associated with mother use of language intervention strategies and subsequent child language skills, (b) BAP traits moderate the relationship between intervention type and mother use of language intervention strategies, and (c) mother social cognitive skills are associated with their use of language intervention strategies and their children's language skills. The proposed study will enroll 108 children with ASD 18 - 36 months old and their mothers. Mother-child dyads will be randomly assigned to one of two parent-mediated intervention strategies that are contrasted in their theoretical approach (responsive-developmental, directive-behavioral). Mother-child dyads will be assessed before randomization (pre-test), after intervention (post-test) and 3 months after the end of intervention to monitor maintenance. Children in both groups will receive 8 weekly intervention sessions at home using the same experimental procedures. The proposed research is significant because it will be the first examination of the impact of BAP traits on bot parent and child outcomes of two different parent-mediated intervention strategies (directive, responsive). Understanding the effects of BAP traits on parent use of intervention strategies and subsequent child language skills is a key step in customizing parent-mediated interventions based on parent characteristics. The long-term positive effect of the proposed research is to improve language outcomes of interventions for children with autism by tailoring parent-mediated interventions that capitalize on parental strengths."
"9444664","ABSTRACT  Human adenoviruses (Ads) comprise more than 70 different types classified into seven species, designated A to G. Ad infections cause diseases of the respiratory track (species B, C, and E), eyes (species D), and gastrointestinal (GI) track (species F). Adenovirus type 40 (Ad40) and Ad41, the only two types making up species F, are one of the main causative agents of acute gastroenteritis in children worldwide. To date, little progress has been made in our understanding of species F pathogenicity, in marked contrast to Ads of other species. The main goal of this application is to fill our gap in knowledge on immune evasion mechanisms of the enteric species F Ads.  The early transcription unit 3 (E3) of Ads encodes proteins that interfere with the human immune system, and, notably, it is one of the most divergent gene regions between species. This suggests a role for E3 immunomodulatory proteins in the species-specific disease patterns exhibited by Ads. Interestingly, in comparison to other Ad species, the E3 region of species F contains a unique set of protein-coding genes whose functions are unknown such that, to date, no immune evasion functions have been uncovered for this species. The objective of this grant is to determine the mechanism employed by Ad40 and Ad41 of species F to modulate host immune functions and identify the viral protein responsible for these effects. The hypothesis is that an E3 protein, unique to Ad40 and Ad41, binds to the MHC class I-related chain (MIC) A and B proteins inside infected cells of the GI track as a strategy to compromise natural killer (NK) cells. The cell surface recognition of MIC A and B ligands by the NK group 2 member D (NKG2D) activating receptor on NK cells is critical for detection and elimination of virus-infected cells by the host. Because MIC A and B are constitutively expressed only on intestinal epithelial cells, and because Ads of species F show a narrow tissue tropism for the GI track, we rationalize that these viruses must have evolved to cope with the immune system of the gut by expressing an immunoevasin that downregulates the cell surface expression of MIC A and B. We have obtained preliminary data in Ad41-infected human cells in support of our hypothesis. In this proposal, we will use a functional (Aim #1) and biochemical (Aim #2) approach to test our hypothesis by studying the effects of Ad40 and Ad41 infection on expression of various cell surface immune proteins, identify the E3 protein that mediates these effects, and determine if this protein can directly associate with the MIC proteins. The significance of our studies is highlighted by the clinical threat that species F Ad infection presents in children worldwide and the current lack of effective treatments."
"9435369","Trypanosoma cruzi is the kinetoplastid protozoan parasite that causes human Chagas disease, a chronic disease with complex outcomes including severe cardiomyopathy and sudden death. In mammalian hosts, T. cruzi colonizes a wide range of tissues and cell types where it replicates within the host cell cytoplasm. Like all intracellular pathogens, T. cruzi amastigotes must meet their metabolic demands by coupling to host metabolic processes. While this metabolic dependency is potentially exploitable to devise strategies for pathogen control, fundamental knowledge of the host pathways co-opted by intracellular T. cruzi amastigotes is lacking.In this broader context, our new discovery that intracellular T. cruzi amastigotes establish close physical contact with host mitochondria via their single flagellum raises the possibility that metabolite sensing and/or acquisition by this intracellular parasite may have a physical basis. Given the key bioenergetic and homeostatic roles of mitochondria, this striking finding suggests a functional role and points to the T. cruzi amastigote flagellum as an active participant in pathogenesis. Here, we propose to develop new molecular tools to test the hypothesis that the T. cruzi amastigote flagellum-host mitochondria contacts are mediated by protein- protein interactions and serve an important function in the parasite's intracellular life cycle. To this end, two complementary and innovative strategies are proposed: (1) To identify T. cruzi amastigote flagellar surface proteins as candidate mediators of the host mitochondria association using a targeted proximity-labeling approach for in situ biotinylation followed by mass spectrometry, and (2) To develop an image-based screening platform to identify small molecule inhibitors that disrupt the flagellum-mitochondria interaction to enable functional studies. Results will significantly advance our goal of determining the mechanistic basis for metabolic coupling between intracellular T. cruzi and its mammalian host cell with a long-term view of exploring the translational potential of these novel findings."
"9402116","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Megakaryocytes (MK) are rare very large marrow cells that give rise to blood platelets. Recent evidence has implicated MKs in regulating hematopoietic stem/progenitor cell (HSPC) activity by the many cytokines and extracellular matrix components produced by these cells. Many hematologic malignancies are associated with MK abnormalities. The myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) are clonal stem cell disorders characterized by HSPC expansion and overproduction of mature blood cells. The acquired mutation JAK2V617F plays a central role in these disorders, but the precise molecular mechanisms responsible for MPN HSPC expansion are not fully understood, limiting the effectiveness of current treatments. MK hyperplasia is a hallmark feature of MPNs. We have shown that JAK2V617F-bearing MKs cause a murine myeloproliferative syndrome with HSPC expansion and increased marrow sinusoidal vascular density. In addition, we have demonstrated that the MPN vascular niche is important for JAK2V617F HSPC clonal expansion. Based on these initial results, we hypothesize that JAK2V617F-bearing MKs have altered hematopoietic niche function which not only enhances stem cell function directly but also affects the vascular niche to indirectly promote HSPC expansion in MPNs. The objective of the proposed work is to determine the physiological effects and the molecular mechanism(s) by which JAK2V617F-bearing MKs maintain and expand HSPCs in MPNs. In particular, we propose the following three specific aims: 1) To study the effects of JAK2V617F-bearing MKs on stem cell function using both a transgenic murine model and human induced pluripotent stem cell lines; 2) To study the effects of JAK2V617F MKs on endothelial cell function in vitro, and the vascular niche and HSPC expansion in vivo. The role of thrombopoietin/MPL signaling in JAK2V617F MK niche function will be assessed; 3) To systemically investigate how JAK2V617F mutation affects megakaryocyte intracellular, membrane, and secreted proteins by quantitative proteomics. The function of selected proteins in HSPC function and vascular niche function will be explored. The long term goal of this research proposal is to identify the complex network of MK signaling in both normal and neoplastic hematopoiesis and develop additional, more effective therapeutic strategies in MPNs and potentially other hematologic malignancies.

"9414038","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Combined Hydrogel/Microparticle Eye Drops for Sustained Delivery of Glaucoma Medication   Glaucoma is the second leading cause of blindness worldwide and costs $2.5B to treat every year in the US alone.  Topical eye drops are the current clinical standard in treating glaucoma and numerous other ocular pathologies.  However, the frequent and difficult administration of eye drops makes them highly inefficient, with patient compliance in some cases as low as 50%.  Poor compliance puts patients at risk for worsening vision and blindness, with a significant increase in treatment costs.  Both patients and clinicians would benefit greatly from a more efficient treatment method that would increase patient compliance and deliver drug more efficiently to the aqueous humor to avoid systemic toxicity.  Contact lenses and novel eye drops including nanoparticles are a comfortable and familiar alternative to traditional eye drops, but have only extended delivery windows to several hours or days at most.  In contrast, formulations that can provide weeks to months of drug release currently require injection or implantation into the eye by a clinician.  If an ocular deliery strategy could combine the comfort and simplicity of an eye drop with long-term drug delivery, it could revolutionize the delivery of not only glaucoma medication, but other ocular medications as well.  The goal of this project is to develop a new, easy-to-administer, and noninvasive treatment capable of long- term release of glaucoma medication to the eye.  Such a formulation would dramatically reduce patient compliance-related complications due to the simple, patient-administered format and the marked decrease in dosing frequency.  The consequences of systemic toxicity and insufficient ocular absorption inherent to eye drops would be mitigated with a more direct delivery of over 100x less drug.  Using a combined approach of highly customizable, polymer microparticle (MP)-controlled delivery of brimonidine tartrate (BT) contained in an in situ forming gel eye drop will provide a comfortable and vastly more efficient delivery format for the treatment of glaucoma.  The gel eye drop is intended for administration to the lower fornix, where it comfortably conforms to the conjunctival cul-de-sac and releases drug for up to 30 days.  The project's primary objective is to optimize custom-designed MPs to release therapeutic levels of BT and engineer a thermoresponsive, hydrogel matrix for retaining the MPs.  In silico modeling methods will be used to develop the drug delivery system, followed by requisite in vitro validation of drug release kinetics.  The gel/MP system will be tested in a rabbit model of ocular hypertension to demonstrate clinically relevant results and sustained BT delivery.  Finally, this new drug delivery system will be evaluated as a platform for treating othe ocular diseases by using noninvasive magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to monitor drug release and distribution in vivo.  Ultimately, this work represents the initiation of preclinical efficacy and safety testing of a modular strategy for delivering of a variety of ocular therapeutic using novel in vivo drug delivery and visualization techniques."
"9591103","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There is a critical need for novel therapeutics to treat antimicrobial-resistant Gram-negative bacteria. Historically, antibiotics were identified in screen using whole bacteria. Over the past 20 years, there has instead been intensive biochemical screening that targets bacterial molecules, an approach that has often identified compounds with significant barriers in either the pathogen or the mammalian host, including an inability to enter or remain within host or pathogen cells, destruction by the host or pathogen, or host cytotoxicity. We have therefore developed a quantitative, image-based high content screen that excludes compounds with undesirable properties because it uses whole, virulent, bacteria growing within mammalian cells. We propose to use this screen to identify therapeutics that target nonessential bacterial virulence factors and will be effective against antimicrobial-resistant bacteria."
"9394822","Project Abstract The microvasculature plays a critical role in the development and consequences of a broad range of cardiovascular diseases. The main assessment of microvascular function is via endothelium-dependent NO- mediated dilation which is reduced as a precursor to coronary artery disease (CAD) and cardiomyopathy. In human arterioles from subjects with CAD loss of NO-mediated flow-mediated dilation (FMD) is compensated by hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) from endothelial mitochondria. Although both are dilators, NO and H2O2 have opposing effects on vascular health, with NO promoting quiescence and H2O2 promoting vascular and parenchymal inflammation leading to atherosclerosis. Understanding mechanisms responsible for this switch in mediator may be key to minimizing tissue stress or injury from vascular paracrine redox toxicity.  The goal of this study is to determine fundamental cellular pathways regulating this switch from NO to H2O2. We propose that two systems, recently shown to be shear sensitive and fundamental to cell function are linked as critical for FMD in human arterioles (HA). The first is autophagy which we propose is the controlling switch that regulates shear-induced production of NO or H2O2. Blocking autophagic flux reduces NO and enhances reactive oxygen species (ROS). The second pathway involves lipid phosphate phosphatase 3 (LPP3), which responds to shear by inhibiting lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), lowering ROS and promoting NO. A single nucleotide polymorphism of this gene, seen in 80% of the population is associated with heightened risk for CAD. We propose that shear-induced activation of LPP3 is needed to maintain NO-mediated FMD in HA.  Neither LPP3 nor autophagy has been linked to the mediator of FMD. We will study fresh human coronary and adipose arterioles in human microvascular endothelial cells in vitro using stimulators and inhibitors of autophagy and LPA to determine their role in FMD. The local tissue impact can be profound given the different effect of NO vs. H2O2 on cardiovascular function. We will test the following hypotheses: Hypothesis 1. Autophagy is critical in maintaining NO as the mediator of FMD in the human coronary microcirculation. Reduced autophagy leads to a switch to H2O2 as the mediator of FMD. Hypothesis 2. LPP3 is upregulated by microvascular endothelial shear resulting in LPA hydrolysis, attenuation of endothelial ROS, with maintenance of NOS-dependent FMD. If LPP3 is mechanistically linked to microvascular dysfunction, this could be an important target, either directly or through LPA, for reducing the vascular inflammation in a large number of genetically CAD-susceptible individuals."
"9390840","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The primary objective of this research proposal is to determine the nature of relationships between levels of cardiovascular (CV) risk factors (anthropometrics, lipids, blood pressure) in childhood and CV morbidity and mortality in adulthood. The NHLBI Pediatric CV Risk Reduction Initiative noted that the lack of longitudinal studies linking CV risk factor levels in children to CV endpoints in adulthood is a major clinical research gap that needs to be spanned. This research will close that gap by pooling data on participants from seven major U.S. and international longitudinal cohort studies that were initiated in the 1970s and 1980s. These studies all have measured detailed CV risk factors in childhood, and have follow-up data spanning childhood and adulthood. They have been collaborating since 2009 as the International Childhood Cardiovascular Cohort (i3C) Consortium, with an administrative organization, regular organizational and data sharing meetings, and fifteen joint publications. Specific Aim 1 of this study is to locate the childhood participants of five NIH-funded longitudinal studies in the U.S. (BHS, MUSC, PFS, MCCS, and NGHS) and two international studies (YFS and CDAH); identify incident CV endpoints (coronary heart disease, myocardial infarction, heart failure, peripheral artery disease, and stroke) using self-reported morbidity validated by adjudication of medical records; and identify decedents using the National Death Index and adjudicate cause of death for deceased participants. In Aim 2, these data will be used to address the hypotheses that: 1) Adverse childhood/adolescent (age 3-19) CV risk factor levels (BMI, total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, triglycerides, BP) are related to increased incidence of CV endpoints in adulthood.; 2) A CV risk score weighting childhood/adolescent risk factors (BMI, BP, lipids, age, sex and race/ethnicity) is a stronger predictor of adult CV endpoints than any individual risk factor.; and 3) The relationship of individual risk factors or CV risk score with adult CV endpoints becomes stronger with increasing age from childhood (age 3-11) to adolescence (age 11-19). Aim 3 will evaluate the association of CV risk score trajectories on adult CV endpoints, focusing on trajectories during childhood/adolescence (hypothesis 4) and between childhood/adolescence and adulthood (hypothesis 5). The present proposal is innovative in that it assembles, for the first time, a cohort of sufficient size (22,883 anticipated recruitment), with childhood risk factor measurements, and with a duration of follow-up (40 years) that will enable follow-up of participants at ages when CV events occur. It will, therefore, provide novel insights into how childhood risk factors contribute to adult cardiometabolic disease."

Dr. Meert, PI for the CPCCRN at WSU for the past 10 years, is a pediatric intensivist with a wealth of clinical and translational research experienc and an established track record of scientific publications for the CPCCRN. Additionally, Dr. Meert has demonstrated research expertise in behavioral medicine and communication science. Strengths of WSU as a clinical site include the Children s Hospital of Michigan (CHM), a free-standing, tertiary care, academic children s hospital offering the full spectrum of pediatric and surgical subspecialty services. The PICU at CHM is a 38-bed multidisciplinary unit that cares for >1500 patients/year with diverse racial and ethnic backgrounds. Over 85% of PICU patients have follow-up within the institution. CHM is an American College of Surgeons verified Level 1 Pediatric Trauma Center and an American Burn Association verified Burn Center. Additional strengths of WSU include its vast experience with federally-funded multicenter research networks such as the Neonatal Network, Adolescent Medicine Trials Network for HIV/AIDS Intervention, Neurological Emergencies Treatment Trials Network, Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network, and the Children s Oncology Group. The concept proposal included in this application builds on prior CPCCRN research, led by Dr. Meert, demonstrating many challenges to achieving high quality parent-clinician communication in PICUs. High quality communication is especially important for parents with low health literacy, a key contributing factor to child health disparities. Patient- and family-centered communication (PFCC) may improve the quality of communication but depends, in part, on parents  active participation (e.g., question asking) during clinical interactions. The objective of the concept proposal is to develop a novel communication intervention, the Question Prompt Toolkit; and determine the extent to which the intervention can enhance PFCC in PICUs, and thus improve child and family outcomes. The central hypothesis is that use of the Question Prompt Toolkit will increase parents  active participation in clinical interactions, knowledge, self-efficacy and trust, reduce parent's  anxiety, and ultimately contribute to better health-related quality of life for the child and reduced family burden, especially for families with low health literacy. The hypothesis will be tested in multicenter research that pursues 2 specific aims: (1) Develop the Question Prompt Toolkit for use among parents of critically-ill children; and (2) Determine the extent to which the Question Prompt Toolkit can enhance the use of PFCC in PICUs and improve child and family outcomes. The proposal is significant because it will contribute a new communication intervention that can be applied in PICU practice to address parents'  communication needs and improve health outcomes."
"9419409","Mechanisms of stress-Induced Persistent Hypertension PROJECT SUMMARY Prolonged and persistent stress is a known risk factor in the development of hypertension. Previous stud- ies have shown that in borderline hypertension, chronic stress-induced increases in arterial blood pressure last for a long period after termination of stress paradigms. However, the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. Chronic stress activates corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH)-expressing neurons in the hypo- thalamus and central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA), which play a key role in regulating autonomic and cardiovascular functions during psychological stress, fear, and anxiety. The overall objective of our project is to determine the role of CeA-CRH neurons in the development of persistent hypertension and the mech- anisms involved. Our preliminary data showed that selectively inhibiting CeA-CRH neurons through a chemogenetic approach prevented chronic stress-induced hypertension in borderline hypertensive rats (BHRs) and that hyperactivity of CeA-CRH neurons was due to a reduction of K+ channel activity resulting from stress-induced increases in histone deacetylase (HDAC) activity. Our pilot study also showed that in- hibition of HDAC activity in the CeA in chronically stressed rats restored K+ expression and decreased fir- ing activity of CeA-CRH neurons. In this proposal, we will test the central hypothesis that hyperactivity of CeA-CRH neurons is responsible for stress-induced hypertension in BHRs and that a reduction in K+ channel activity caused by stress-induced upregulation of HDAC leads to hyperactivity of CeA-CRH neu- rons in stress-induced hypertension. Because the chronic unpredictable mild stress rat model closely re- sembles precipitation of depression by chronic and low-grade stressors in humans, this model will be used to test the hypothesis. We have 4 specific aims: We will attempt to determine the role of CeA-CRH neurons in the sustained hypertension in chronically stressed BHRs (aim 1), determine the role of CeA-CRH neu- rons in regulating blood pressure and sympathetic outflow in chronically stressed BHRs (aim 2), determine the role of K+ channels in the CeA in hyperactivity of CeA-CRH neurons and heightened sympathetic out- flow in chronically stressed BHRs (aim 3), and identify the epigenetic mechanisms involved in long-lasting downregulation of K+ channels in chronically stressed BHRs (aim 4). Our proposal is innovative because findings from our proposal are expected to provide novel information about the cellular and molecular mechanisms responsible for stress-induced persistent hypertension in borderline hypertension. This new information is significant because it may provide an important rationale for development of new strategies to treat neurogenic hypertension."
"9383054","ABSTRACT: Malignant primary brain tumors represent the most frequent cause of cancer death in children and young adults and account for more deaths than cancer of the kidney or melanoma. Glioblastoma (GBM) is uniformly lethal, and current therapy is non-specific and produces a median overall survival of <15 months. In contrast, immunotherapy promises an exquisitely precise approach, and substantial evidence suggests that T cells can eradicate large, well-established tumors in mice and humans even when tumors reside within the brain.Dendritic cells (DCs) bearing tumor antigen can be delivered as a vaccine and migrate to the draining lymph nodes (DLN) to trigger the formation of potent tumor-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) capable of eradicating tumor while leaving normal tissue unharmed. However, despite individual cases of remarkable patient responses to antitumor DC vaccination, overall objective responses in early phase clinical trials have remained under 15%. The migration of vaccine-delivered DCs is low (~5%), and preclinical studies have demonstrated that preconditioning the vaccine site with the inflammatory cytokines can increase DC migration to the DLN and proportionately increase the magnitude of the antigen-specific T cell response. We hypothesized that preconditioning the vaccine site with the recall antigens in Tetanus/diphtheria toxoid (Td) would induce inflammation, increase DC migration, and elicit more consistently efficacious antitumor immunity. In a recent study in patients with newly diagnosed GBM published in Nature, we demonstrated that unilaterally preconditioning one vaccine site with Td resulted in increased bilateral DC migration to the DLNs and a significant increase in progression free survival and OS - with three of the six Td treated patients living past 4.5 years. A recapitulative murine model corroborated these findings, demonstrating that Td preconditioning both enhanced systemic DC migration to the DLNs and suppressed tumor growth in an antigen-dependent manner. Examination of both patient and murine sera revealed that the chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 3 (CCL3) was the only cytokine or chemokine significantly upregulated after Td preconditioning. Furthermore, in mice we demonstrated that the systemic increase in DC migration after Td preconditioning is dependent upon CD4+ memory effector T cells (CD4Td?mem) and CCL3. However, recent pilot data from our laboratory indicate that the CD4Td?mem are actually responsible for the production of CCL3, suggesting CCL3 serves as the primary driver of the improved antigen-dependent immunity from Td preconditioning. We hypothesize that in addition to enhancing the migration of DCs to the DLN, that CCL3 directly increases antigen-specific T cell magnitude and functionality as well as immune cell trafficking to tumor. This proposal will mechanistically determine the specific role of CCL3 in DC migration, antigen-specific T cell responses, as well as immune cell trafficking, and will further assess if the antitumor efficacy of DC vaccination can be further enhanced by the use of exogenous CCL3 as a vaccine-enhancing drug."
"9473532","Research Summary Human cytomegalovirus (CMV) is a ?-herpes virus that increases morbidity and mortality in immuno- compromised individuals. The major populations at high risk for CMV-associated diseases are unborn children and transplant recipients. Currently, CMV disease is treated with anti-viral drugs including ganciclovir (GCV), valganciclovir (valGCV), foscarnet (PFA), and cidofovir (CDV). Despite the efficacy of these drugs, there are severe limitations that include poor oral bioavailability, dose-related toxicity, and development of drug resistant viral mutants. Moreover they are precluded for use in pregnant women. An alternative therapy is human anti- cytomegalovirus immune globulin (CMV-IGIV, Cytogam) derived from pooled adult human plasma that shows limited effectiveness. The numerous shortcomings of the current therapies and the lack of pharmaceutical options to prevent and treat CMV disease warrant the development of more potent and safer anti-CMV therapies. Thus, our objective of this R21 grant is to develop antibody-drug conjugates (ADC) using antibodies that recognize viral envelope proteins that target virus-infected cells. During virus infection, the envelope proteins gB and gH are expressed on the cell surface during the late phase of virus replication. The surface expressed envelope proteins represent biomarkers for virus-infected cells that could be specifically targeted by biologics to limit virus proliferation. The specificity of an ADC would selectively inhibit virus dissemination in cells actively replicating virus. We hypothesize that targeting the membrane envelope proteins gB and gH of virus-infected cells with ADCs will effectively prevent virus propagation and dissemination. Utilizing CMV neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against envelope proteins gB and gH, we plan to accomplish our objective by: 1) Characterizing the anti-CMV mAbs that broadly recognize virus-infected cells. Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) directed against CMV envelope proteins to diverse epitopes of gB and gH will be labeled with a fluorophore to characterize the mAbs that efficiently bind to virus infected cells and are internalized during the virus life cycle. And 2) Determining the efficacy of ADCs to limit viral replication and dissemination. The anti-gB and -gH mAbs with the highest level of internalization in virus-infected cells will be conjugated with the antiviral drug ganciclovir or an antimitotic agent (a new-generation toxoid) to determine conditions that effectively limit virus proliferation in multi-cycle growth assays. We are expecting to identify the mAbs that are amenable to drug conjugation to be utilized as potential ADCs to limit CMV replication and dissemination."
"9392485","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): ATP-sensitive potassium (KATP) channels response to the intracellular energy state of the cell through directly nucleotide binding. KATP channels sense intracellular ADP content and, in response, regulate membrane potential. The major KATP regulatory component found in the ventricular cardiomyocyte is the sulfonylurea receptor (SUR)-2, encoded by the Abcc9 gene. Like other ABC transporter proteins, SUR2 is a multi- transmembrane protein with two nucleotide-binding folds. Glyburide, a sulfonylurea antagonist, is used commonly to treat diabetes, although this class of medications has been reported to increase cardiovascular risk in diabetics. The clinical use of drugs that act through the SURs, as well as the possibility to develop additional agents that utilize these pathways, argues for improved understanding of SURs and their role especially in high energy demand tissue like the heart. Mutations in the Abcc9/SUR2 gene cause dilated cardiomyopathy and more recently have been linked to Cantu syndrome, a rare multisystem disorder that includes cardiomegaly (Harakalova et al., 2012; van Bon et al., 2012). The Abcc9 gene undergoes alternative splicing to produce SUR2, a characteristic ATP binding cassette protein, and also a smaller 55 KDa protein, which we termed SUR2- 55. Like SUR2, SUR2-55 can couple with the partner potassium channel but SUR2-55 is enriched in mitochondria. Deletion of the Abcc9 gene in a manner that leaves SUR2-55 intact, leads to coronary artery vascular spasm, hypertension, sudden cardiac death. In contrast, deletion of Abcc9 in a manner that ablate both SUR2 and SUR2-55 leads to neonatal cardiomyopathy in the first 10 days of life. The newborn heart is known to transition from glucose to oxidative metabolism during this window, and this transition is impaired in Abcc9 deleted mice. In separate experiments, we found that transgenic overexpression of SUR-55 in the heart protects the heart from ischemic reperfusion injury. We hypothesize that Abcc9-encoded proteins, through KATP channels, contribute to the metabolic balance especially under stress conditions such as the newborn heart and in ischemic myocardium. Ablation of Abbc9 in the newborn and adult myocardium will be used to define SUR2 complexes and their role in the heart."
"9391614","?     DESCRIPTION:      Cognitive deficits in Parkinson's disease (PD) are often progressive and frequently represent the most debilitating symptom that result in decreased functional outcome and quality of life (QoL). It is estimated that 20-50% of individuals with PD meet criteria for Mild Cognitive Impairment (PD-MCI), which is characterized as the transitional phase between normal cognition and dementia. Unfortunately, there are few pharmacologic treatment options to help with cognitive impairments associated with PD-MCI. Cognitive rehabilitation based on the development of compensatory strategies represents a non-pharmacological approach to improve cognition in PD-MCI. However, to our knowledge there are no studies examining this approach in PD, which is a critical gap in our knowledge. Moreover, neuropsychiatric symptoms (e.g. sleep difficulty, mood), common in PD, are often neglected in traditional interventions. Thus, the overall aim of this investigation is to determine the efficacy of a novel, manualized compensatory cognitive rehabilitation program to improve cognitive deficits as well as improve neuropsychiatric symptoms and quality of life/health status (QoL/HS) in individuals with PD-MCI. This program, Cognitive Symptom Management and Rehabilitation Therapy for Parkinson's Disease (CogSMART-PD), is a 10-week intervention that provides cognitive skills training and teaches compensatory strategies to help individuals with PD-MCI cope with and adapt to cognitive deficits. Also, the program provides psychosocial and stress-reducing techniques to attenuate common neuropsychiatric symptoms that often negatively impact cognitive functioning and QoL. Our preliminary data demonstrated that CogSMART-PD holds great promise for the treatment of cognitive and neuropsychiatric symptoms in PD-MCI. To our knowledge, this is the first proposed randomized, parallel, controlled study to investigate the efficacy of a compensatory cognitive rehabilitation program adapted specifically for PD. We hypothesize that cognitive functioning, neuropsychiatric symptoms, and quality of life/health status will improve in  PD-MCI participants following 10 weeks of the CogSMART-PD, and these improvements will be maintained at 6- and 12-months post-treatment. One hundred ten participants with PD-MCI based on the criteria set forth by the Movement Disorder Society will be recruited for this study. Over-recruitment by 20% will be instituted to account for subject attrition or unusable data. Participants will be randomized into either a 10-week CogSMART-PD intervention group (n = 55) or 10-week supportive care group (n = 55). All participants will be assessed with a battery of tests that measure objective and subjective cognitive function, neuropsychiatric symptoms, disease severity, motor symptoms, and quality of life/health status by an examiner blinded to group assignment. Assessments will be administered at baseline, 10 weeks (post-treatment), and 6- and 12- months (follow-ups). Data will be primarily analyzed using analyses of covariance and linear random effects modeling. Results of this study will provide essential information about a non-pharmacological intervention for individuals with PD-MCI that could improve their cognition, neuropsychiatric symptoms, and quality of life/ health status. Moreover, these results may demonstrate the first evidence of preventing or stabilizing functional cognitive decline in PD and could provide a manualized and systematic program that can be feasibly implemented and disseminated throughout the VA Healthcare System."
"9423669","SUMMARY This proposal seeks to test the hypothesis that the specific activation of the G-protein-coupled receptor GPR75 (Gq) in the endothelium and vascular smooth muscle is central to the mechanisms underlying 20-HETE- dependent vascular dysfunction and hypertension. The foundation for this hypothesis stems from studies implicating the cytochrome P450 (CYP) 4-derived 20-HETE in setting the level of systemic arterial blood pressure (BP), in human subjects and experimental animals, via actions on vascular and renal structures. We demonstrated that pharmacological and genetic interventions that increase synthesis of 20-HETE in rodents also cause elevation of BP. Conversely, the BP of hypertensive rodents, featuring increased 20-HETE synthesis, was diminished by pharmacological or genetic manipulations that interfere with the synthesis or the action of this eicosanoid, thus providing compelling evidence that 20-HETE contributes importantly to pro- hypertensive mechanisms. Previous and preliminary studies, have shown that conditional overexpression of Cyp4a12 (the murine 20-HETE synthase) selectively in endothelial cells (EC) or vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) prompts development of hypertension in mice, raising the intriguing possibility that the mechanism(s) underlying 20-HETE-induced hypertension vary with cell type targeted by this eicosanoid. It also raises the possibility of the presence of a common target/receptor that governs distinct cell-specific 20-HETE-triggered signaling pathways leading to complex functional outcomes, including endothelial dysfunction, ACE induction/RAS activation, inflammation, smooth muscle contraction and vascular remodeling; all of which contribute to BP regulation. In this regard, we have exciting preliminary data demonstrating the identification of a G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR), GPR75 (Gq), an orphan GPCR, as the putative 20-HETE receptor. We show that: 1) 20-HETE specifically binds to EC membranes and this binding is negated in GPR75-deficient membranes; 2) 20-HETE stimulates GPR75-G?q/11 dissociation in EC and VSMC and intracellular i[Ca2+] accumulation in EC; 3) GPR75 knockdown negates 20-HETE-stimulated EGFR phosphorylation, the initial signaling step of 20-HETE in EC; 4) GPR75 is expressed in tissues where 20-HETE exerts its actions (EC, VSMC, renal arteries and kidney); and 5) In vivo knockdown of GPR75 prevents DOX-induced 20-HETE-driven BP elevation, endothelial dysfunction, smooth muscle contractility and vascular remodeling in Cyp4a12tg mice. Accordingly, we postulate that 20-HETE binds to GPR75 and triggers cell-specific signal transduction pathways leading to endothelial dysfunction, ACE upregulation, smooth muscle contractility and vascular remodeling, all of which contribute to hypertension We propose four aims that systematically determine the proximal signaling of GPR75-20-HETE pairing in EC and VSMC and assess the importance of GPR75 activation to the hypertension driven by increased 20-HETE production."

"9456134","Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the leading cause of severe lower respiratory tract disease in young children worldwide, and is also a major cause of morbidity in the elderly and immunocompromised populations. No approved RSV vaccine exists. Our goal is to define broadly protecting antibody epitopes on RSV G protein. RSV G protein is one of two major immunogenic proteins on the RSV surface and plays key roles in virus attachment to airway epithelial cells and virus modulation of innate immune defenses. Despite the important role of RSV G protein in infection and pathogenesis, little is known about the structural and molecular features that govern its activities. Our central hypothesis is that the central conserved region of RSV G protein contains both linear and conformational epitopes for broadly protecting antibodies. Using an integrated structural and biophysical approach, we will pursue two specific aims to (1) Identify RSV G protein constructs that maintain high-affinity binding to anti-G antibodies and (2) Use structural studies to define epitopes on RSV G protein recognized by broadly protecting antibodies. Results obtained by this work will provide a molecular roadmap for the development of novel RSV G vaccine immunogens to prevent RSV infection and disease."
"9392570","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We are submitting this renewal to continue our long-standing program, Academic Training in Pediatric Pulmonary Diseases, which is based at the University of Colorado. Over the past 25 years, this program has trained post-doctoral fellows in biological and medical sciences for successful academic careers in pulmonary research and teaching. We have provided a multidisciplinary approach to both mentoring and research training that emphasizes the integration of studies at the molecular, cellular, tissue organ, and physiological (whole animals or human subjects) levels to permit rapid bench-to-bedside translation of research. Over the years, our program has primarily emphasized developing clinician-scientists to translate laboratory science with clinical research and care. We have extended our program to include more PhD scientists as faculty and trainees, and have encouraged greater cross-disciplinary interactions among basic and clinician scientists. In this renewal, we now propose to continue to expand our training program to include greater access to expertise in exciting new fields of outcomes research, epidemiology, bioengineering, epigenetics and genomics, regenerative medicine and informatics. We also seek to improve our recruitment of under-represented minority candidates and present a more rigorous mentorship program for both faculty and trainees. This approach will address the growing need to provide novel training strategies to increase opportunities for young scientists to develop successful academic careers in systems biology, team science and outcomes research, along with our more traditional strengths in laboratory investigations. Thus, our overall goal is to provide our fellows with the professional skills to lead sustained and productive academic research careers in pediatric lung diseases. Specific objectives of this program include: 1) to provide trainees wit an intensive research experience in laboratory- , patient- or population-oriented research in pediatric lung diseases by linking promising candidates with outstanding mentors who are rigorously selected based on scientific qualifications and experience in training; 2) to provide trainees with essential research skills and information regarding career development in academic medicine through structured course work, lectures and seminars, which emphasize training in ethics and scientific integrity academic survival skills, specific research tools and exposure to diverse research methodologies; 3) to enhance and teach skills in mentorship to junior faculty through active co-mentoring of trainees with senior faculty with a formal training program. This program continues to include outstanding mentors who, in addition to success in their focused areas of research, are committed to teaching broad research skills, such as performing scholarly reviews of the literature; formulating hypotheses and study design; developing essential skills in statistics, oral and written presentation of scientific findings and grant writing; understanding issues and defining potential problems of scientific integrity and ethics; and others. The program leadership will further ensure close monitoring of trainees' progress through the active use of individualized oversight committees. (End of Abstract)"
"9392186","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Heart failure (HF) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in the developed world, but the molecular mechanisms that lead to the development of HF are not totally understood. Mammalian Snf1-related kinase (SNRK) is a serine/threonine kinase with sequence similarity to AMP-activated kinases (AMPK); however, its primary function is unknown. To better define the function of SNRK in cardiac metabolism, we have generated a transgenic (TG) mice that overexpress SNRK in the heart. SNRK TG mice display 30- 50% less glucose and fatty acid (FA) oxidation and have reduced oxygen consumption despite maintaining normal cardiac function, suggesting that they are more efficient in substrate utilization. The mechanism for metabolic efficiency appears to be through improved mitochondrial coupling, as the levels of uncoupling protein (UCP)-3 are reduced in SNRK TG mice, and state 3/state 4 respiration is increased. To determine the mechanism by which SNRK regulates mitochondrial coupling, we performed a yeast two hybrid screen to identify novel binding partners of SNRK. Tribbles homolog 3 (Trib3), a negative regulator of Akt activation and glucose metabolism, was found to bind to and be upregulated by SNRK. We also showed that SNRK regulates UCP3 and mitochondrial coupling through a pathway that involves Trib3 and PPAR?. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that SNRK affects cardiac metabolism by reducing substrate utilization and increasing mitochondrial coupling, and that SNRK overexpression protects against the development of HF and ischemic injury. In Aim 1, we will assess whether deletion of SNRK will result in the opposite phenotype of its overexpression, i.e., increased glucose and FA metabolism with similar cardiac force. We have generated global SNRK+/- mice and cardiac-specific SNRK knockout (KO) mice, and will measure cardiac metabolic parameters in these animals. We will also assess the role of Trib3, UCP3 and PPAR? in this process. In Aim 2, we will test whether the reduced glucose and FA metabolism that occurs in the hearts of SNRK TG mice is mediated through Trib3. We have generated SNRK TG/Trib3 KO mice, and will measure glucose and FA metabolism in their hearts. We will also investigate the mechanism of Trib3 regulation by SNRK, and PPAR? regulation by Trib3. Finally, in Aim 3, we will determine whether SNRK is protective against the development of HF and ischemic damage, and will study the mechanism for this protective effect. We will subject SNRK TG mice to ischemia-reperfusion and pressure overload, followed by the measurement of cardiac function and reactive oxygen species production (using novel fluorescence probes). To determine the mechanism, we will assess the role of Trib3/PPAR?/UCP3 pathway in this process. Our studies showing that SNRK reduces FA and glucose metabolism and improves mitochondrial coupling promise to advance our knowledge of the role of cardiac metabolism in HF, and may lead to the development of novel therapies for this disorder."
"9380971","Summary Tech-1 Technology Component 1 describes essential work on existing custom software. This work will add new functionality to the Xenbase database and allow us to represent both anatomical and gene expression phenotypes from Xenopus experiments using an EQ syntax as well as with GO annotations.

To build this we will use logic from other MODs, that like Xenabse use a GMOD/Chado schema and we will adapt the web-application and interface code that we have already established for gene expression. Our experienced development team, along with the new hires outlined in this proposal, will build phenotype representation into Xenbase in a 2 year time frame. We will add representation of phenotypes as changes in gene expression levels within another year. Adding content and collaborating with external resources to maximize the impact of these data in understanding the molecular basis of human disease will take an additional 2 years."
"9442882","Project Summary / Abstract  The functional importance of CD28 in controlling the set point for immune responsiveness has been well established over the past two decades. Initially, the impact of CD28 was attributed to amplification of TCR signaling during activation of nave T cells and generation of effector function. However, CD28 can also enhance Treg development and function, implicating CD28 in the negative regulation of immune responses. We have discovered of a novel mechanism that controls the avidity of CD28 ligand binding. Our results support a model in which inside-out signaling from the TCR induces a rotation of lumenal, ligand binding domains of CD28 around the dimer interface that allows for a switch from monovalent to bivalent binding and a resulting increased avidity for ligand. We have identified a mutation (KK/IP) within the dimer interface that stabilizes CD28 in this high avidity conformation. We have now introduced this mutation into the germline CD28 locus. The overall goal of this proposal is to determine the functional consequences of bypassing the requirement for TCR signaling to express high avidity CD28 ligand binding. We will achieve this goal through two Specific Aims: 1. Determine the functional impact of constitutive high avidity CD28-ligand binding on T cell tolerance and homeostasis. The balance between CD28 and CTLA-4 engagement within both effector T cells and regulatory T cells can control the outcome of the immune response. In this regard, constitutive expression of high avidity CD28 ligand binding may phenocopy loss or diminished CTLA-4 expression that can result in lymphoproliferative disease. In this Aim, we will test this possibility and determine whether the KK/IP mutation enhances homeostatic expansion of effector T cells and/or misregualtion or Tregs. 2. Determine the functional impact of constitutive high avidity CD28-ligand on CD28 costimulation during T cell activation. The most well documented role for CD28 is during costimulation of nave T cells. In addition to initial T cell activation, CD28 costimulation can impact on T cell differentiation into effector T cells, in particular to Tfh cells. In this Aim we will determine the impact of the KK/IP mutation on nave T cell activation and effector cells differentiation using both in vitro and in vivo activation models. 1"
"9386760","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Severe pulmonary hypertension is a progressive and irreversible disease that often leads to mortality due to right heart failure. The pathogenesis of pulmonary hypertension involves proliferation of cells, including endothelial cells (intimal remodeling), in the vessel walls of pulmonary arteries resulting in remodeling and pulmonary hypertension. Several factors implicated in the remodeling process are driven by hypoxia. One mechanism by which cells respond to hypoxia is by stabilization of hypoxia-inducible transcription factors (HIFs), HIF-1alpha and HIF-2alpha. Independent studies suggest that both HIF-1alpha and HIF-2alpha are important mediators in PH. However, recent investigations have reported a marked increase in HIF-2alpha gene locus polymorphism in individuals adapting to high altitudes, suggesting a role of HIF-2alpha in PH. Mechanism by which HIF-2alpha influences pulmonary vascular remodeling and PH, independent of HIF-1alpha is not known. This proposal is focused on understanding the role of HIF-2alpha and its pathways in the pathogenesis of pulmonary hypertension.  We have recently identified a new pathway, the HIF-2alpha-A2A receptor pathway, by which HIF-2alpha can promote endothelial proliferation, independent of HIF-1alpha. We hypothesize that hypoxia increases endothelial  proliferation and vascular remodeling through a HIF-2alpha and A2A receptor-dependent mechanism and that this  is an important step in the pathogenesis of PH. Additionally, we have also identified HIF-1alpha in smooth muscle  cell proliferation, independent of HIF-2alpha. The proposed studies are divided into three aims. Aim 1 will elucidate mechanisms by which hypoxia and HIFs influence endothelial growth using cultured primary pulmonary endothelial cells as well as endothelial cells derived from hypertensive rats. The second aim will be used to test the hypothesis that inhibition or knockdown of HIFs, particularly HIF-2alpha will limit vascular remodeling and PA pressures in a rat model of PAH. The third aim will test whether inhibition or knockdown of A2A receptor, a downstream transcriptional target of HIF-2alpha, can mitigate remodeling and PA pressures in a rat model of PAH.  The in vivo aims will investigate effects using both a prevention model and a rescue model. Results of the proposed research will help provide insights into hypoxic pathways that influence pulmonary vascular remodeling and offer alternative targets for treatment of PH."
"9395923","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): 7-Dehydrocholesterol (7-DHC) is an important lipid in human biology. It is the immediate biosynthetic precursor of cholesterol and it is also a precursor to vitamin D3. Very recent discoveries indicate that 7-DHC is very prone to undergo free radical chain oxidation with molecular oxygen, i.e. lipid peroxidation. Indeed, 7- DHC's reactivity makes it more susceptible to lipid peroxidation than nearly any other known compound. Lipid peroxidation is associated with many human diseases, including neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson's, ALS, Alzheimer's and Huntington's diseases. Many of the compounds formed during lipid peroxidation have potent biological activities and neurodegeneration may be associated with these toxic peroxidation products.  A human syndrome affecting 1 in 20-70,000 individuals, Smith-Lemli-Opitz Syndrome (SLOS), is caused by a defect in the enzyme (Dhcr7) that promotes the last step of cholesterol biosynthesis. This defect results in an increase by up to 10,000-fold of 7-DHC concentrations in individuals suffering from this syndrome. SLOS causes a range of brain abnormalities and these patients also exhibit mental retardation and autism-like symptoms. This proposal is focused on the consequences of the accumulation of 7-DHC in SLOS. Our guiding hypothesis is that the peroxidation of 7-DHC and the formation of 7-DHC oxysterols plays an important role in the pathophysiology associated with SLOS.  The hypothesis also states that accumulation of 7-DHC, either by genetic disposition or by exposure to small molecules that disrupt cholesterol biosynthesis can have health consequences. This focuses our studies in the next grant period to assessing the distribution and metabolism of 7-DHC oxysterols in cells and tissues, defining mechanisms associated with 7-DHC oxysterol pathology, devising strategies to reduce fluid and tissue levels of 7-DHC and/or its oxysterols in vivo, and accurately measuring levels of sterols and oxysterols in SLOS affected, SLOS carrier and control human plasmas in order to enable therapeutic studies. We assert that methods to accurately measure 7-DHC and its oxysterols in cells, fluids and tissues and strategies to understand and moderate the pathophysiology associated with this sterol will have an impact on a number of health issues ranging broadly from errors in sterol biosynthesis to drug toxicity and exposures.  Lipid peroxidation is frequentl linked to neurodegenerative disorders and the relevance of this research to public health is the linkage of the fundamental studies in the chemistry and biology of peroxidation and its inhibition proposed here to neurodegenerative disorders, including a devastating syndrome, SLOS."

"9414629","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Podocyte depletion is a major determinant of chronic kidney disease. Because podocytes lack the ability to regenerate, the only way that podocytes can cope with ongoing functional stress is by hypertrophy of remaining podocytes. Currently, little is known about the molecular mechanisms that coordinate this process in acquired kidney diseases. In the current proposal, we identify and characterize a novel podocyte to podocyte hypertrophic signal that is activated by injury and coordinates the podocyte injury response. We recently reported that increased expression of the Rap1 activator inhibitor Rap1GAP rendered genetically resistant podocytes sensitive to injury (J Clin Invest, 2014). Examination of injured podocytes in murine kidney disease models and kidney biopsies from glomerulosclerosis patients revealed that podocyte injury was associated with enhanced Rap1GAP expression and subsequent Rap1 inhibition.  Here, we identify synaptogagmin-like protein 2a (Slp2a), an exocytosis effector molecule, as a direct binding partner of Rap1GAP. Similar to Rap1GAP, expression of Slp2a is massively increased in injured podocytes both in mouse models and in human glomerulosclerosis patients. Our preliminary data in cultured podocytes suggest that over-expression of Slp2a results in a paracrine signal that drives cellular hypertrophy of adjacent cells by a mechanism that requires mTORC1 activation. Furthermore, genetic deletion of Slp2a in mice abrogates compensatory podocyte hypertrophy after uni-nephrectomy resulting in proteinuria and accelerated glomerulomegaly. We hypothesize that after podocyte injury, increased formation of a protein complex that includes Rap1GAP and Slp2a drives compensatory hypertrophy by stimulating release of podocyte-derived proteins that then activate mTORC1 in adjacent cells. The goals of this grant are to definitively prove the existence of such podocyte crosstalk. In aim 1, we examine the mechanisms of Slp2a-mediated cellular hypertrophy that include proteomic studies to identify the secreted hypertrophic factor. In aim 2, we characterize podocyte hypertrophy in a novel mouse model that allows for stochastic Slp2a expression in individual podocytes. In this way, we will be able to determine the ability of enhanced Slp2a expression to induce hypertrophy both in an individual podocyte and in its neighboring cells. Finally, in aim 3, we build on our preliminary finding that absence of Slp2a in mice abrogates compensatory podocyte hypertrophy. At the conclusion of these studies, we will have defined a novel type of podocyte crosstalk as a mediator of compensatory hypertrophy, the only available mechanism by which podocytes try to adapt to ongoing stressors induced by podocyte loss. This will represent a major step in our understanding of the mechanisms of proteinuria."
"9591099","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The discovery of antibiotics and their introduction into clinical practice has reduced the threat posed by infectious agents and has led to a marked decrease in deaths from diseases that were previously widespread, untreatable and frequently fatal. However, the selective pressure imposed by the widespread use of antimicrobials in human and veterinary medicine has led to the emergence of bacterial strains resistant to first- line therapy. Recognizing the possibility of returning to a clinical equivalent of the pre-antibiotc era, the Federal Government has recently issued an Executive Order (09/18/2014) outlining the immediate need for new antibiotics or alternative therapies to treat infections caused by multi-drug resistant (MDR) pathogens. Lytic bacteriophage are attractive antimicrobials because they are part of the normal human flora, amplify at the site of infection, and are innocuous to human cells. Despite the therapeutic potential of lytic phage, translational and clinical development of natural phage has been hindered mainly by their narrow host specificity compared to antibiotics, poor penetrability into surface attached bacterial communities (biofilm) and susceptibility to both human and bacterial defenses. Because simple methods for manipulation of large virulent genomes are still lacking, most recent efforts to develop highly effective therapeutic phage have largely centered on development of large natural phage cocktails able to eliminate a wide range of bacteria rather than construction of unique phage with desired therapeutic properties. These hurdles can be overcome by genetic engineering of lytic phage. Based on our expertise in assembling and editing large genomes in vitro, our proposal aims to examine the feasibility of a synthetic biology platform for the construction of phage with superior therapeutic efficacy against MDR pathogens. This platform will not only allow rapid expansion of phage host range, but could also be exploited to genetically impart other important characteristics such as biofilm disruption or immunity to host resistance systems. Finally, selected engineered phage strains with desired characteristics will be included in cocktails optimized to kill more than 90% of MDR clinical isolates within a broad library and will be the basis of preclinical product development. Although our platform will have broad applicability for the development of phage as antimicrobials, proof-of-concept studies will focus on MDR P. aeruginosa and its well characterized lytic phage. If successful, this proposal will: i) provide state-of-the-art tools to simplify and accelerate the manipulation and analysis of lytic P. aeruginosa phage, ii) expand the antibacterial spectrum of engineered phage by broadening their host range, iii) provide valuable information on phage-host interactions in an important human pathogen, and iv) create a well-defined and fully characterized bacteriophage cocktail for preclinical development to treat MDR P. aeruginosa."
"9425835","This new RO1 proposal explores novel mechanisms of cardioprotection involving micro-axial flow pumps (TV- Pumps) as a platform to reduce myocardial damage and heart failure (HF) after an acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Prior attempts to limit reperfusion injury have failed in part due to the mandate for rapid coronary reperfusion, thereby limiting time for any beneficial impact of a therapeutic agent. We recently reported that mechanically unloading the left ventricle (LV) and delaying reperfusion (Primary Unloading) reduces infarct size and increases expression of the cardioprotective cytokine stromal derived factor 1 alpha (SDF1a). We will now explore new mechanisms regulating the cardioprotective effect of Primary Unloading and further test the durable impact of acutely reducing infarct size using this approach. The PI is an interventional cardiologist and advanced heart failure specialist who studies molecular mechanisms of cardiac remodeling and the hemodynamic effects of circulatory support pumps. The current proposal integrates expertise in coronary and ventricular physiology, mechanical circulatory support, molecular biology, and interventional cardiology to the field of myocardial reperfusion injury, for which no specific therapy currently exists. We will test the novel hypothesis that activating a TV-Pump and delaying coronary reperfusion (Primary Unloading) limits myocardial damage through a two-component mechanism involving: 1) reduced LV wall stress, myocardial oxygen demand, and increased collateral blood flow thereby reducing ischemic injury prior to reperfusion and 2) activation of a cardioprotective signaling program that requires intact SDF1a activity and further that these beneficial mechanisms will improve long term outcomes. Exciting new preliminary data shows that Primary Unloading for 30 minutes reduces infarct size by 50% and promotes a graded increase in collateral blood flow that reduces ischemic injury before reperfusion through the infarct related artery. Using intracoronary delivery of pharmacologic inhibitors and recombinant peptides during LV unloading, we further identified that Primary Unloading limits SDF1a degradation and sequestration, thereby promoting SDF1a activity. These pioneering approaches address major knowledge gaps by studying the effect of Primary Unloading on coronary blood flow and wave energetics and further overcome critical barriers associated with cardioprotection in AMI. To test our central hypothesis we will employ highly translational studies in large animal models to determine the physiologic (SA1) and molecular signaling (SA2) mechanisms underlying the cardioprotective effect of Primary Unloading and (SA3) to test the therapeutic utility of Primary Unloading to reduce late-term cardiac remodeling after AMI. This proposal has tremendous potential to impact our understanding of coronary and ventricular physiology, acute mechanical circulatory support, cardioprotection, and cardiac remodeling with important implications for AMI patients at risk of ischemic HF."

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection remains a major public health problem in the United States (US) with an estimate of up to 2.2 million persons chronically infected. The Hepatitis B Research Network (HBRN) was established in 2008 to address the research priorities identified at the 2008 NIH Consensus Conference on Hepatitis B. The HBRN comprises 13 clinical consortia (21 adult and 7 pediatric clinical centers) in the US and in Toronto, Canada, a data coordinating center, and an immunology center. During the initial funding cycle of HBRN, the investigators developed and implemented an observational cohort study, a clinical trial for patients in the immune tolerant phase and a clinical trial for patients in the immune active phase of HBV infection. This Clinical Center application comprises 2 sites: University of Michigan in Ann Arbor (PI: Dr. Lok) and University of Hawaii/Queen's Medical Center in Honolulu (PI: Dr. Tsai). The Michigan-Hawaii (MI-HI) team has made important contributions to the HBRN studies through enrollment and retention of patients, and data and biospecimen collection. Furthermore, we have played a key role in designing the study protocols and data forms, serving and chairing on HBRN committees, and drafting and editing abstracts and manuscripts. As Chair of the HBRN Steering Committee and Executive Committee since its inception, Dr. Lok has provided leadership in the design and execution of scientific studies, establishing policies for HBRN, and setting up collaboration with industry partners. The specific aims of the MI-HI consortium in the next funding cycle of HBRN are: 1) to continue to enroll patients into HBRN studies and to follow those who have been enrolled to study completion; 2) to contribute to the development of new study proposals making use of data and biospecimens that are collected to further our understanding of the epidemiology, natural history, pathogenesis, and treatment of hepatitis B; and 3) to participate in data analyses and dissemination through abstract presentations and manuscripts. The ancillary study we propose aims to determine: 1) prevalence of co-existent HBsAg and anti- HBs; 2) associating epidemiologic factors; 3) clinical significance; 4) quantitative HBsAg levels and correlation with anti-HBs levels; 5) prevalence of immune escape variants and mixed HBV genotypes/serotypes; and 6) epitope recognition and neutralizing ability of circulating anti-HBs in HBRN participants (adults and children) with co-existent HBsAg and anti-HBs."
"9388379","PROJECT SUMMARY Over the past two decades, the development of new immunosuppressive agents has greatly improved early post-transplant survival. Nevertheless, long-term survival has not improved significantly, due to chronic rejection, infections, and malignancies - all attributable to chronic immunosuppression. In lung transplantation, chronic allograft rejection, as manifested by obliterative bronchiolitis, fibrosis, and/or vasculopathy, represents the principal cause of graft loss and patient demise after the first year following transplantation. It is now well established that both antigen-dependent and antigen-independent factors contribute to both acute and chronic rejection in a synergistic manner. We have long held the position that the establishment of transplant tolerance is the paradigm shift that will transform the field of transplantation by obviating the need for long term systemic immunosuppression with its attendant complications (malignancy, toxicity, and infection), while simultaneously preventing both acute and potentially chronic rejection. Tolerance of kidney allografts has been achieved in non-human primates (NHPs) and in humans using a strategy that induces hematopoietic mixed chimerism. We have modified and extended this approach to lung transplantation in NHPs by adding the interleukin (IL)-6 signal blocker tocilizumab (anti-IL6R mAb) to our delayed, non-myeloablative conditioning regimen. This has allowed us to achieve long-term lung allograft tolerance without chronic rejection in NHPs for the first time, albeit only in one-MHC haplotype mismatched donor/recipient pairs. Attempts to cross more stringent histocompatibility barriers have led to acute and/or chronic rejection. From a mechanistic point of view, it appears that the tolerance obtained in NHPs is not simply deletional tolerance, as seen in most murine chimeric models, but is highly dependent on 1) enhancing regulatory responses and 2) dampening pro- inflammatory states. We therefore hypothesize that to successfully induce tolerance of fully MHC-mismatched lung allografts without the development of chronic rejection we must develop protocols which further enhance immune regulation and which prevent antigen-independent inflammation. This hypothesis will be tested in Aim 1. Our overall goal is to generate a tolerance protocol that can be applied to human lung allograft recipients. Thus, once the optimal tolerance induction protocol is identified in Aim 1, attempts will be made to substitute the investigational components of the protocol with FDA-approved agents making it suitable for clinical use in Aim 2. Finally, it is clear that chronic rejection is refractory to current therapies, including in some circumstances, tolerance induction. Therefore, in Aim 3 we will perform integrated mechanistic studies of the pathogenesis of chronic rejection and use the results to design modifications of the optimal protocol achieved in Aim 2 in order to prevent this complication."
"9468658","PROJECT SUMMARY The ability to appropriately interact with the environment is fundamental to an animal's survival, and a network of interconnected brain regions subserves this purpose. When a part of this network goes awry, such as the basal ganglia in Parkinson's disease, quality of life decreases and so does survival. The superior colliculus (SC) is a highly conserved midbrain structure that works in this network as a sensorimotor hub to guide attention and movements toward salient environmental stimuli, an essential survival behavior for identifying food and foe. In this network, the SC presumably transforms sensory and cortical information (e.g., sights and sounds, motivational state) into action (i.e., movement initiation); however, due to the tangle of cell types and projections to, within and from the SC, current approaches have been unable to determine how this transformation is accomplished. This proposal aims to uncover the functional circuitry underlying goal-directed behaviors by examining the intra-SC dynamics that guide these behaviors. The experiments proposed are motivated by the synthesis of behavioral and slice physiology studies that together demonstrate a functional organization in the SC. The SC is organized along the horizontal axis to direct behavior to contralateral space so that, for example, movement to rightward space is directed by the left SC. The focus of this proposal is on the integrative and motor output properties of the intermediate and deep layers of the SC. Here, two specific SC populations will be recorded from and manipulated during behavior. The first Aim will address how SC premotor output neuron location within the SC influences the type of movement executed. This will be accomplished using a dual-virus method to restrict channelrhodopsin (ChR2) to a specific population of SC premotor output neurons in a cohort of animals trained on a sensorimotor task. These premotor output neurons can then be tracked throughout behavior to identify precisely when they are active and also optically activated to determine how these premotor output neurons drive behavior. The second Aim will investigate the role of SC inhibitory neurons by implementing similar methods, with the hypothesis that their activity influences the selection of behaviorally relevant stimuli. The results acquired from these experiments will inform models for how neural circuits mediate behavior and also inform how similar circuits can be repaired therapeutically in motor pathologies."
"9386091","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Obesity is a major public health concern that has led to a worldwide epidemic and is the underlying cause of diabetes, atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease. Excessive visceral and subcutaneous fat is predictive of vascular disease and associated complications, including vascular dysfunction, insulin resistance and decreased levels of the fat burning nuclear receptor, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor ? (PPAR?). In addition to PPAR? regulating fatty acid metabolism, it has anti-inflammatory properties in vascular inflammation and atherosclerosis, most likely through induction of adiponectin. Adiponectin is an adipose- specific hormone with anti-inflammatory and vascular protective properties, and its circulating levels are decreased in obesity. Obesity increases oxidative stress by enhancing reactive oxygen species and simultaneously decreases expression and activity of key cytoprotective systems including heme oxygenase (HO) and bilirubin as well as PPAR?, while increasing inflammatory cytokines and insulin resistance. These consequences of obesity-mediated adipocyte dysfunction (decreased PPAR?/adiponectin and increased inflammatory adipokines such as TNF?, IL-1 and IL-6) may lead to vascular dysfunction, which is a prelude to vascular disease and hypertension. Here we provide novel data that bilirubin activates PPAR? activity, which may function as an endogenous ligand agonist. We hypothesize that the three protective factors, bilirubin, PPAR? and adiponectin, are inextricably linked forming a functional module and a deficiency in any of these factors within adipocytes leads to adipocyte and vascular dysfunction that is associated with obesity. We will test this model in vitro and in vivo to show that bilirubin has protective ani-obese and anti- diabetic properties that are mediated by PPAR? that reduces vascular dysfunction."
"9386041","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Project Summary/ Abstract Public housing was developed to provide stable housing for low-income families. It has since become synonymous with concentrated poverty. Programs to reduce poverty have focused on dismantling public housing to be replaced, if at all, by mixed income design alternatives. Studies have shown that low-income residents living in public housing have deleterious health outcomes. It is not clear, however, how public housing residents fare on a number of cardiovascular health indicators compared to those with an alternate low-income housing arrangement. Mechanistic models that incorporate housing with neighborhood access to resources and individual behaviors are poorly defined and understood. However, examining individual- and neighborhood- level data in synergistic ways can provide an important contribution to existing health campaigns to address cardiovascular disease in low-income populations.  The current proposal uses a novel geocoding approach to analyze primary care electronic clinical record data in relation to housing and neighborhood level data from various sources in order to track health outcomes. This analysis approach focuses on individual level data within the context of the patient's housing and neighborhood environment.  This K 01 award is designed to provide the foundation both conceptual and technical for Dr. Chambers to develop a career trajectory that combines prior experience in social and built environmental determinants of health with new knowledge in socio-ecologic models, graphical science, multi-level statistical modeling, and research informatics. The long-term goal is to develop clinical and public health partnerships that will use multi- source data, including housing and neighborhood environment, to the develop interventions that target vulnerable patient populations.

"9471616","ABSTRACT/SUMMARY  Immunological homeostasis reflects a balance between the host response and the antigenic environment. In mucosal immunology, inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), including ulcerative colitis or Crohn?s disease, reflect a disruption in homeostasis with exaggerated host responses to the local microbiota in genetically susceptible hosts. Our microbial communities are dynamic so regulatory Th cells induced in the periphery (pTreg) are important to maintain a flexible homeostasis with these diverse organisms. Many factors modify the metabolic balance that maintains homeostasis and Treg function. Relevant to this proposal, studies have associated a disruption in adenosine metabolism with IBD in humans and in animal models. Adenosine is a purine metabolite derived from ATP through its conversion to ADP and 5?AMP by CD39 while CD73 continues the metabolism to adenosine. As the production of ATP from dead cells or bacteria is pro-inflammatory, its catabolism to adenosine is one means to restrict inflammation. Adenosine has direct anti-inflammatory properties mediated primarily through the A2A adenosine receptor (A2AAR) expressed by lymphocytes as well as antigen presenting cells and innate lymphoid cells. Moreover, we present new findings suggesting that adenosine shifts the energy metabolism in Th cells in order to confer its anti-inflammatory effects. Other data show that the absence of adenosine initiates the expansion of pathogenic Th cells, a decrease in Treg, and selects for microbiota that transmit susceptibility to colitis. The hypothesis for this study is that adenosine is required to maintain immunological homeostasis in the digestive tract. More specifically, disrupting adenosine production or responsiveness impacts lymphoid cell fate that subsequently changes bacterial colonization, creates a dysbiosis and promotes inflammation. The broad objective of the project is to define the role of purine metabolism on the control of immunological homeostasis in the gut as addressed in the following interrelated Specific Aims:  Aim 1: Identify how lymphoid-microbial homeostasis relies on adenosine.  Aim 2: Determine how adenosine controls protective responses to microbiota  Aim 3: Define the role of purine metabolism in controlling lymphoid cell fate. .  The proposed experiments will explore novel aspects of immunological homeostasis. These studies will have a positive impact on the basic understanding of lymphoid cell plasticity and provide new knowledge that can be used to expedite the identification and development of therapeutic strategies for immune-mediated diseases."
"9390489","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In this new collaborative proposal, we investigate the ability of Rho GTPases to modulate both cytoskeletal and membrane apical-basal polarization to control endothelial cell (EC) tubulogenesis. Our previous studies demonstrated critical roles for Cdc42 and Rasip1 during this process. Using state-of-the art in vitro and in vivo approaches, we have demonstrated a fundamental role for Cdc42 during EC lumen formation using cultured human ECs and during mouse vascular development and blood vessel growth (previous studies and preliminary data shown here). Inactivation of Cdc42 function leads to disruption of EC polarization in vivo and in vitro that results in a failure to properly form or organize EC tube networks. In addition, together, we showed that Rasip1, a modulator of small GTPase function, is required for EC tubulogenesis, both in vivo and in vitro. We showed that Rasip1 is required to activate the GTPases Cdc42 and Rac1, as well as to suppress RhoA in ECs. Together, this work underlined the central importance of GTPase activity during blood vessel morphogenesis. We recently screened tubulogenic ECs and identified multiple modulators of GTPase activity as key regulators of this process. We have identified additional GTPases that work with Cdc42 to control vascular tubulogenesis, including Rac isoforms, k-Ras and Rap1. A key functional role of GTPases is to stimulate membrane trafficking from the basal to apical surface through vesicle transport along polarized microtubule tracks (which are enriched in acetylated tubulin and which are present in a subapical membrane domain to promote membrane fusion events at the apical surface). We observe strong enrichment of Rac, activated Src and Rasip1 at EC apical membranes and within vesicles that are being transported apically. We have also discovered novel regulators of tubulogenesis, including the GTPase effectors IQGAP1, MRCK?, and beta-Pix, and critical guanine exchange factors (GEFs) Dock6, Sos1 and FGD5, that activate Cdc42, Rac, and k-Ras during this process. In addition, we have found that Arhgap31 (inactivates Cdc42 and Rac) and Rasa1 (which inactivates Ras) are critical regulators, revealing that in order to properly control and balance EC tubulogenesis, negative regulators are necessary, while the Rasip1-associated Arhgap29, which inactivates Rho, is required for EC tubulogenesis, both in vivo and in vitro. Together, these results provide a molecular road map for how ECs change their shape, polarize and reorient junctions, all with the ultimate goal of forming functional tubes that carry blood, a capacity essential for blood vessel formation and tissue viability. Here, we propose to use genetic and in vitro approaches to dissect how complicated signaling pathways control specific cellular events to support blood vessel morphogenesis. The focus of this proposal is to elucidate the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying how Cdc42 and other GTPases control cytoskeletal polarization and vesicular trafficking to drive EC morphogenesis and tubulogenesis. We propose three specific aims to examine the process of EC tubulogenesis in vivo and in vitro: Specific Aim #1. To elucidate how the small Rho GTPase Cdc42 controls EC tubulogenesis via cytoskeletal polarization, apical membrane trafficking and EC junction formation to facilitate multicellular tube assembly and stability. Specific Aim #2. To determine how Rac-, k-Ras-, and Rap1 interact with Cdc42 during EC tubulogenesis. Specific Aim #3. To identify and functionally characterize critical GTPase GEFs and GAPs which positively and negatively regulate EC tubulogenesis."
"9395928","ABSTRACT Impaired tissue vascularization is a critical feature of peripheral artery disease (PAD) and diabetes and can lead to tissue necrosis and amputation. Several clinical strategies have been designed to increase revascularization in PAD patients beyond the current standard of care (e.g., endovascular procedures and bypass grafting), including delivery of growth factors and cell-based therapies. While variably successful, these therapies have limited efficacy in part because they do not address the underlying chronic inflammation, which is a primary feature of PAD and diabetes. Tissue revascularization is a critical component of normal wound- healing and is regulated in part by macrophages. Resolvins are a new family of lipid mediators biosynthesized during the resolution phase of inflammation by macrophages. Resolvins limit inflammatory signaling and neutrophil chemotaxis, while simultaneously promoting the clearance of apoptotic cells by macrophages. In this funding period, we found that diabetes impairs resolution and that resolvins restore defective resolution and promote cutaneous wound healing in diabetes. Our recent results indicate that resolvins promote ischemic revascularization, suggesting that they have new roles in activating the wound-healing program. This renewal is designed to test the innovative hypothesis that resolvins generated by macrophages promote revascularization during hind limb ischemia (HLI). This hypothesis postulates that by resolving inflammation, resolvins can also rescue defective revascularization in atherosclerosis and diabetes. Specific aims of this application are: 1. Determine the biosynthesis and endogenous roles of resolvins in revascularization during HLI. We identified resolvin D1 (RvD1) and RvD2 in both skeletal muscle and bone marrow during HLI. Here, we will determine how their production relates to inflammation-resolution and revascularization, determine how resolvin production is affected by adoptive transfer of monocytes, and how genetic deficiency of recently identified RvD1 and RvD2 receptors impacts revascularization; 2. Delineate the mechanisms whereby resolvins enhance ischemic revascularization. We found that resolvins enhance limb perfusion during HLI by promoting arteriogenesis. In this aim, we will determine whether their actions in promoting arteriogenesis are affected by genetic deficiency of resolvin receptors in myeloid cells or endothelial cells and determine how resolvins regulate arteriogenic phenotypes of macrophages and endothelial cells; and 3. Assess whether resolvins promote revascularization in mice with pre-existing atherosclerosis or diabetes. We will determine how these chronic inflammatory diseases impact resolvin biosynthesis and eicosanoid tissue profiles and whether resolvins enhance revascularization while resolving inflammation. Completion of these aims will provide entirely new information about the biological functions of resolvins that could potentially lead to the development of a new class of therapeutics that both resolve inflammation and increase tissue perfusion."
"9565024","Project Summary Research Advances in DNA sequencing have revealed that cancer genomes harbor chromosome rearrangements of unexpected frequency and staggering complexity. Despite the recognition that these variations can enable cancer development by inducing pro-growth genetic change and facilitating clonal evolution, the instigating factors and mechanisms behind rearrangement are often unknown. This proposal aims to identify the underlying causes of cancer-associated chromosome rearrangements by focusing on errors during mitosis, especially in the context of dicentric chromosome formation. Telomere fusions, which occur during human tumorigenesis when critically short telomeres become dysfunctional, generate dicentric chromosomes. This stage of telomere fusion, genomic instability, and frequent cell death is known as telomere crisis (TC). Dr. John Maciejowski's previous work has shown that the dicentric chromosomes formed during TC are resolved after attack by the cytoplasmic nuclease, TREX1, yielding chromothripsis (chromosome shattering) and kataegis (clustered hypermutation). Here, Dr. Maciejowski will use his established, genetically tractable model of TC to determine if enzymatic attack is directly responsible for observed genomic variants (Aim 1). This approach will utilize whole genome sequencing to assess rearrangement and mutation phenotypes associated with loss of a specific gene. In addition, he will develop novel assays to detect prior TC in cancer genomes (Aim 2) with the overall goal of defining the role of TC in cancer etiology (Aim 3). Finally, he will use his previously developed karyotype-based rearrangement screening and whole genome sequencing pipeline to identify additional causes of genome rearrangement by defining the genomic changes associated with dysfunction of the spindle assembly checkpoint, a cell cycle checkpoint that ensures high fidelity chromosome segregation during mitosis and is often dysregulated in cancer (Aim 4). Collectively, this proposal combines the versatility of mammalian tissue culture genetics and the power of whole genome sequencing with the aim to provide deep insights into a key aspect of tumorigenesis: the genome rearrangements that spur cancer progression and tumor evolution. Candidate Dr. Maciejowski's long-term goal is to understand the impact of errors in chromosome segregation on chromosome rearrangement, aneuploidy, and cancer development. He plans to use whole genome sequencing to assess genomic instability after the introduction of chemical or genetic perturbations in chromosome segregation or DNA repair pathways. His background in Mathematics and extensive training in chromosomal biology, the mechanisms of mitotic chromosome segregation, and human tissue culture systems provide him a solid foundation to achieve this goal. During the K99/Mentored Phase, Dr. Maciejowski will be trained in bioinformatic methods with applications in whole genome sequencing analysis. This will be critical for his future research and help launch his career as an independent investigator. Environment During the K99/Mentored Phase, Dr. Maciejowski will be supported by an outstanding group of scientists: Dr. Titia de Lange is an expert in the consequences of telomere dysfunction and will serve as primary mentor. Dr. Marcin Imielinski is a computational biologist with expertise in developing algorithms to probe cancer genome structure. Collaborators will include Dr. Peter J. Campbell, a leader in cancer genomics, and Dr. Achim Jungbluth, an expert in pathology. Together, this group comprises a strong multidisciplinary research team that will successfully execute the proposed experiments and advance a training plan that will help Dr. Maciejowski transition to an independent academic position. Dr. Maciejowski will be trained in advanced sequencing approaches including: paired end sequencing, inferring copy number from read depth, and identifying rearrangements and mutations. Career development will also be emphasized. Research will primarily be performed at The Rockefeller University, which offers unsurpassed resources, established mechanisms for career development, and a collegial academic environment. Given the strong support of his mentoring team and the excellent environment at RU, Dr. Maciejowski expects to identify and transition to an independent tenure track position at an institution supportive of his R00/Independent Phase research goals. !"
"9389399","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Blood gas poisoning with carbon monoxide (CO) remains a major cause of death and disability, affecting 50,000 persons a year in the U.S. alone. Patients with greater than 30% carboxyhemoglobinemia may develop brain injury, long-term neurocognitive deficits, and/or death. In the present proposal we introduce the first antidotal therapy for carbon monoxide poisoning, based on the finding of a surprising and near-irreversible CO-binding affinity of mutationally engineered human neuroglobin. Neuroglobin, like cytoglobin and many plant Hbs, is a six-coordinate hemoprotein, with the heme iron coordinated by a proximal and distal histidine residues. In an effort to understand the function of this bis-histidyl structure, we performed mutagenesis of the proximal histidine 64 molecule (e.g. H64Q) which opens the heme pocket, forming a five-coordinate molecule, more similar to the heme pocket of Hb or myoglobin. Unexpectedly, this molecule exhibits a remarkably high affinity for gaseous ligands, with a P50 value for oxygen (PaO2 value at which 50% of the heme binds oxygen) of 0.01 mm Hg (normal value is 26 mm Hg). This finding informs our primary hypothesis, that H64 mutant neuroglobin will bind CO with high affinity, producing a five-coordinate trap for CO. In our preliminary experiments we find that mutationally engineered H64Q neurglobin binds CO with an affinity more than 300 times that of hemoglobin and can remove CO from intact red cells in vitro and in vivo in CO exposed mice in less than 2 minutes. We propose to refine this molecule in a series of in vitro, pre-clinical physiology, and translational studies as a human biological antidote for CO poisoning and test its ability to clear CO from red blood cells, critical organs (lung, brain, and heart), and cytochrome C oxidase of the mitochondrial electron transport chain. From a translational perspective, will test the ability of this antidote to improve long-term organ function and survival after severe CO poisoning."
"9448160","Project Summary The RNA virus that causes influenza is inhaled into the airways and binds to terminal sialic acid residues on host cell surface glycoproteins via viral sialic acid receptors. The tracheitis, bronchitis and bronchiolitis that results is often accompanied by incapacitating cough, headache, fever and myalgias, but the syndrome usually resolves in 7-10 days without development of alveolitis. This is fortunate because once the pulmonary parenchyma is involved, mortality increases almost 60 fold, from 0.3 to 17.8 annual deaths per 100,000(2006 CDC data). Because we believe that infection of alveolar type II (ATII) cells is the pivotal event in the conversion of a self-limited influenza virus (IV) airway infection to a potentially lethal alveolar infection, our proposal focuses on the mechanisms that render the ATII cells resistant or susceptible to infection with IV. Although ATII cells are clearly the primary epithelial target for IV in the alveolus, they are remarkably resistant to IV infection in their typically quiescent state in the unperturbed lung, in which fewer than 1% of ATII cells are cycling. Recent in vitro studies have demonstrated that the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway, which regulates cellular proliferation, plays a key role in susceptibility and severity of IV infection by enhancing cell surface binding, endocytosis, lysosomal acidification driven entry into the cytoplasm, replication using cellular translational machinery, and anti-apoptotic mechanisms that prolong viral production. Mitogenic stimulation of PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway with intrapulmonary keratinocyte growth factor (KGF) converts ATII cells from a quiescent, IV resistant state to a proliferative, IV susceptible state, and hastens the progression of IV infection from the conducting airways to the alveolus, markedly accelerating mortality. Our hypothesis is that key host factors, such as transient hyperoxia, render hosts susceptible to influenza pneumonia (IP) through their impact on the proliferative tone of the ATII pool. Our goals are to determine the mechanisms of mitogen-induced susceptibility to influenza A virus susceptibility by completing three specific aims: 1) mechanisms of mitogen- induced susceptibility of AECII cells to IAV infection, 2) host states that affect IAV susceptibility through mitogenic effects on AECII cells, 3) genetic models of AECII signaling and anti-proliferative strategies for IAV prophylaxis and therapy. Successful completion of these aims will reveal the importance of a paradigm-shifting, AECII-centric host susceptibility mechanism, and suggest novel approaches to influenza prophylaxis and therapy."
"9395896","Project Summary: Antitumor B (ATB), also known as Zeng Sheng Ping, is a tablet made according to modern GMP standards. It contains the extracts of following six Chinese medicinal herbs: Sophora tonkinensis, Polygonum bistorta, Prunella vulgaris, Sonchus brachyotus, Dictamnus dasycarpus, and Dioscorea bulbifera. Previously, clinical studies have shown significant chemopreventive efficacy of ATB against human esophageal squamous cell carcinomas and oral cancers. In a randomized clinical trial in patients with oral leukoplakia, treatment with ATB (4 tablets, 3 times per day for 8?12 months) reduced the size of oral lesions in 68% of the patients versus 17% of the patients in the placebo control group (P < 0.01), indicating that ATB may be a potent preventive agent against the development of oral cancer in humans. We found that ATB inhibited chemically induced oral squamous cell carcinomas (by ~60%) in mice and identified several key active compounds that are capable of inhibiting oral cancer cell proliferation. Our published study also showed that several key active compounds were found in the oral tissues and likely contributed to the chemoprevention effects of ATB. However, it is unknown if a key active component (KAC), called ATB-KAC? which is enriched with 50% or more of three active compounds (i.e., dictamine, fraxinellone and maackiain) and therefore better chemically defined for QA/QC purposes, will have a stronger efficacy against oral carcinogenesis than ATB. We will use both the 4NQO-induced oral carcinogenesis mouse model and a ?window of opportunity (WOO)? trial approach to determine the efficacy of ATB-KAC? along with its pharmacodynamic (PD) responses and pharmacokinetic (PK) properties and biomarkers of efficacy. We hypothesize that oral administration of a better chemically defined ATB-KAC? can significantly increase efficacy in preventing oral carcinogenesis in mouse models and will have the desirable PK properties and biomarker responses in both mice and humans. Aim 1 will perform phytochemical and pharmacokinetic characterizations of ATB-KAC? and develop a PD/PK model to describe their efficacy and biomarker responses. Aim 2 will conduct mouse oral cancer chemoprevention studies to determine the efficacy of ATB-KAC? on oral carcinogenesis and to identify novel biomarkers. Aim 3 will perform a WOO trial of ATB, ATB-KAC?, or placebo in patients with newly diagnosed oral cancer. This proposal is timely and significant because the proposed WOO trial is important step for the development of ATB-KAC? for future human phase II studies by filling the knowledge gap between biomarkers in humans and those in the matched mouse models. In addition, we will measure the PD and PK responses of ATB-KAC? in the WOO trial and develop a PK/PD model to further enhance our understanding the necessary dose needed for future phase II human studies."
"9469374","PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT Hyperphosphatemia is common in advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD) and end stage renal disease (ESRD) and strongly associated with cardiovascular events (CVE) and all-cause mortality. Evaluation of the mechanisms by which hyperphosphatemia causes CVE and mortality have focused almost exclusively on macrovascular complications including arterial calcification and stiffness. Recently, evidence has emerged suggesting that higher serum phosphate concentrations and greater dietary phosphate intake may lead to microvascular dysfunction, which may provide a new pathway through which phosphate contributes to cardiovascular disease. In this proposal we aim to characterize the effects of greater phosphate intake and greater serum phosphate concentration on microvascular function using novel measurements of the microvasculature. In the Maastricht Study approximately 3400 people underwent skin capillaroscopy, flicker heat-induced skin %-hyperemia (laser-Doppler flowmetry), and light-induced retinal arteriolar %-dilation, all to assess microvascular function in different vascular beds. I will use samples from the Maastricht Study cohort biorepository to measure serum phosphate concentrations and 24-hour urine phosphate and investigate associations with microvascular function. I am interested in extending these findings to advanced CKD, and to determine if manipulating phosphate status acutely influences microvascular function. Thus, I will also conduct a pilot study in which I will randomize 20 ESRD patients to lanthanum carbonate vs placebo in a crossover design. I will measure skin capillaroscopy and laser-Doppler flowmetry in order to understand the acute effects of phosphate changes on microvascular function. Through this proposal we will gain critical insights into the effects of phosphate on the microvasculature across the spectrum of CKD, develop new expertise in measures of microvascular function, and generate critical preliminary data to support my application for a career development award (K23)."
"9438694","PROJECT ABSTRACT To date, colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most commonly diagnosed cancer and cause of cancer death in the US. Although the median survival of patients with metastatic CRC has improved to 2 years over the last three decades, chance for cure remains less than 10%. These unfortunate facts translate into increasing number of patients being actively treated with chemotherapy, which poses huge financial burden on the patients, their families and the health system. Therefore, effective systemic therapy with curative potential is clearly an unmet medical need for these patients. Current standard treatments consist of strong chemotherapy that is highly toxic but with only 50% chance of working. For those who initially benefit from chemotherapy, disease progression as a result of drug resistance is inevitable. We now found, for the first time in literature, that CRC cells frequently armor themselves by activating the innate immune signaling, a self-defense mechanism that is usually summoned when cells are injured or invaded by microorganisms. In doing so CRC cells become highly invasive and resistant to chemotherapeutics. Our approach is to ?deactivate? such defense mechanism in CRC cells by inhibiting Interleukin-1 Receptor-Associated Kinase 4 (IRAK4), the master switch that controls the innate immune pathway. By doing so we found that CRC cells become greatly weakened and are much more vulnerable to chemotherapy. We plan to further confirm and study these potentially impactful findings by pursuing the following two aims:  1. Aim 1: We will utilize CRC cell lines and patient-derived xenografts to clearly investigate the role of IRAK4  in various aspects of CRC biology including the ability to grow in 3-dimensional culture, invasion,  resistance to chemotherapy and metastasis. These studies will clearly establish if IRAK4 is a novel  therapeutic target in CRC that should be pursued in the clinic.  2. Aim 2: CRC is a cancer that is closely associated with chronic inflammation, in which IRAK4 may play a  key role. In this aim we will study, using human CRC samples and a genetic CRC mouse model, whether  IRAK4 is progressively activated following tumor progression, and if so, whether activated IRAK4 in CRC  is associated with poor prognosis, as we have reported to be the case in pancreatic cancer. We will  further characterize whether loss of IRAK4 will thwart CRC initial or progression in this genetic mouse  model. These studies will provide new scientific knowledge and the potential value of IRAK4 inhibition  in chemoprevention. Page 1 of 1"
"9392935","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)    Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is the most common indication for heart transplantation in the western world. RBM20 (RNA binding motif protein 20) is a recently described cardiac-specific, RNA splicing protein that is mutated in 2-3% of DCM. RBM20 directly binds to the RNA transcripts of many cardiomyopathy-associated genes and ensures the production of cardiac-specific protein isoforms. Human studies revealed a striking, unexplained, recurring pattern of seven tightly clustered single amino acid DCM-associated substitutions near the RS domain of RBM20. The tight pattern of heterozygous mutations in DCM patients and biochemical studies of RBM20 binding proteins suggest that human DCM mutations could have dominant negative interfering effects on the RBM20 splicing complex. Our central hypothesis is that the RBM20 RS domain mutants cause dominant negative interference resulting in pathophysiological RNA splicing that are distinct from loss-of-function mutations. We plan to develop a series of isogenic human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-cardiomyocytes (iPS-CMs). We have made multiple single-base RBM20 mutations without antibiotic selection (scarless) in iPSCs. We can efficiently produce RBM20 RS domain mutant (R636S) iPS-CMs, and the cells display cellular pathology consistent with DCM. RNA-Seq studies of R636S mutant iPS-CMs reveal >360 alternative splicing events, including many that have been previously reported. Our aims are:  Aim 1. To test the hypothesis that RBM20 DCM-causing point mutations have a dominant negative effect, by analyzing pathological changes in splicing by RNA-Seq. We will engineer the seven recurring human DCM mutations into isogenic iPSCs, as well as RBM20 null mutations. The RNA-Seq studies will focus on identifying the most pathological alternative splicing events that could explain the DCM pathology.  Aim 2. To test the hypothesis that RBM20 RS domain mutation (R636S) has different RNA- and protein- binding, we will use FLAG and APEX epitope tagging respectively, to selectively identify binding partners. We will use FLAG-RBM20-RNA binding assays (CLIP-Seq) to determine the exact RBM20 RNA binding sites. FLAG- and APEX-APMS will identify putative binding partners and regulators of RBM20.  Aim 3. To determine if the putative binding partners are essential for RBM20 splice regulation. We will conditionally silence the expression of putative binding partners. We will use CRISPRi to modulate the expression of each gene, to determine if each protein is a potential therapeutic target.  With the completion of these aims, we will directly test our hypothesis that would explain the pattern of human RBM20 mutations, and provide a molecular mechanism for pathological splicing. We will have defined the molecular targets and protein partners of RBM20. Drugs that alter RBM20 activity could enhance cardiac health and repair, via a novel mechanism. These studies will provide a foundation for developing a human iPS-CM-based platform to develop new therapeutics."
"9470518","Project Summary/Abstract Most adult mammalian tissues and organs have very limited regenerative potential. In patients with a heart attack, the death and loss of heart muscle cells is irreversible and often results in permanent scarring and potentially life-threatening arrhythmias. In contrast, neonatal mice and adult zebrafish are able to rapidly regenerate their hearts. Genetic lineage-tracing experiments have revealed proliferation of pre-existing cardiomyocytes as the dominant mechanism to generate new muscle cells. However shortly after birth, the majority of cardiomyocytes in most mammalian species undergoes a last round of DNA replication without cytokinesis, become binucleated, and withdraw from the cell cycle. What physiological signals trigger mammalian cardiomyocyte perinatal binucleation and cell cycle arrest, and how these stimuli are differentially regulated in animals with distinct cardiac regenerative potentials are among the most long-standing questions in cardiomyocyte biology. Our preliminary observations from comparative analyses of cardiomyocytes across phylogeny, in vivo chemical screens of candidate pathways, together with functional studies in both mice and zebrafish suggest a critical role of the perinatal changes of endocrine systems in driving cardiomyocyte proliferative and regenerative potential loss in the mammalian heart. In this proposal, we plan to combine a novel cardiomyocyte quantification assay with state-of-art genetic tools to investigate the functions of nuclear hormone receptor activation in regulating cardiomyocyte proliferation during postnatal growth (Aim 1) and heart regeneration following myocardial injury (Aim 2). In addition, we will examine the underpinning cellular and molecular basis, and determine the function of novel downstream target genes in cardiomyocyte cell cycle control through gain- and loss-of-function approaches (Aim 3). Successful completion of the proposed work will thus reveal mechanisms underlying the loss of cardiomyocyte regenerative potential in ontogeny and phylogeny."
"9447866","Project Summary This proposal represents our continuing efforts to contribute to NIDDK's Strategic Plan to eliminate racial and ethnic disparities in chronic kidney disease (CKD), including end-stage renal disease (ESRD; stage 5 CKD). Despite extensive research over the last two decades, critical knowledge gaps persist. First, African Americans (AAs) and Hispanics continue to have 2-3 times higher incidence of ESRD than non-Hispanic whites (whites), but paradoxically have much better survival than whites after reaching ESRD and undergoing dialysis. Speculation is that this apparent survival advantage is related to survival disadvantage and inadequate care for AAs and Hispanics during the pre-ESRD period, but confirming this has been hampered by methodological challenges. Second, we still do not understand how differences in mortality between minorities and whites evolve over time as the disease advances. And third, we do not fully grasp how processes of care, which are potentially modifiable and vital to improving outcomes, affect survival selections among minorities (vs. whites).  To close these longstanding knowledge gaps, we propose to conduct the first event-history analysis of national incident CKD populations to examine in-depth racial/ethnic disparities in outcomes and processes of care over the full course of CKD. Our central hypothesis is that differences in mortality between minorities (AAs and Hispanics) and whites are time-dependent over the course of CKD, and that differences in ESRD are related to the differences in pre-ESRD, which result from differential survival-selection processes between the groups. The analyses proposed under our three Specific Aims will test this and other specific hypotheses and examine a range of factors for the differential survival selections, particularly the processes of care. Aim 1 will yield a detailed characterization of how racial/ethnic differences in mortality evolve over the full course of CKD. Aim 2 will examine the effect of processes of care on differential survival selections among racial/ethnic groups, which drives the time-dependent changes found in Aim 1. Aim 3 will assess the role of unexplained risks in these differential survival-selection processes. In addition to our novel hypotheses and innovative analytic approaches, this study will foster methodological advances in CKD research, which include the use of 1) two national incident CKD cohorts with >15 years of follow-up that connect the pre-ESRD and ESRD periods?the national veteran CKD population (>1.3 million) for primary analyses, and the Medicare CKD population (>790,000) for further understanding of processes of care across the nation; and 2) advanced statistical techniques, including time-dependent multi-state survival models and frailty models. This study will offer novel understanding of why differential survival rates among AAs and Hispanics vs. whites exist and how they can be addressed. Our results for real-world processes of care among AAs and Hispanics can be directly translated into actionable initiatives to enhance care for minority CKD patients. Building on our team's outstanding record, we anticipate that our efforts will continue to be novel, productive and highly impactful. ."
"9398070","Summary Sudden cardiac death kills 180,000 to 450,000 Americans annually. In patients without coronary artery disease, the highest risk of sudden death is in those with cardiomyopathy and intraventricular conduction delay. Furthermore, males experience sudden death almost three times more frequently than females and the reasons for this sex bias are unclear. Identifying the mechanisms underlying cardiomyopathy and conduction disorders may improve screening for patients at risk for sudden death, or outcomes of those revived from cardiac arrest. To date, most known mutations that cause cardiomyopathy are in sarcomere cytoskeletal proteins whereas most familial cardiac conduction diseases (CCD) are caused by mutations in ion channels or channel interacting proteins. However, mutations in cytoskeletal proteins can also cause CCD but the mechanisms linking the cytoskeleton to CCD are not well understood. There is a gene or genes on chromosome 6 (6p22) associated with sudden cardiac death near the cytoskeletal protein CAP2 (Cyclase Associated Protein 2). CAPs are widely conserved cytoskeleton proteins. We first identified CAP in yeast as an adenylyl cyclase binding protein. Additionally, all CAP homologs are actin monomer binding proteins that regulate the balance between actin filaments and actin monomers. Mammals have two CAP isoforms, CAP1 and CAP2. To determine the function of CAP2 in vivo we generated CAP2 knockout (CAP2-KO) mice, both whole body and conditional. Our preliminary data show that whole body CAP2-KO mice are born alive, but many die suddenly shortly after birth, with only ~30% of male CAP2-KO surviving beyond 12 weeks. CAP2-KO mice develop CCD with mild dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). The conduction phenotypes are more penetrant in cardiomyocyte-specific CAP2-KO mice, with all mice dying of complete heart block by 25 weeks. Furthermore, genome-wide analysis revealed that several transcriptional networks, including the serum response factor (SRF) network, were upregulated in the hearts of CAP2-KO mice. Based on these findings we hypothesize CAP2 maintains cardiac conduction by modulating SRF signals and fibrotic responses in a sex-specific manner. These studies are relevant to understanding the role of the cytoskeleton and gender specificity in cardiac conduction and sudden cardiac death. To test this hypothesis, we propose the following specific aims: To test this hypothesis, we propose to (1) Determine the specific role of CAP2 in the cardiac conduction system (2) Determine the role of CAP2 in serum response factor (SRF) signaling, and (3) Determine the role of Secreted Frizzled-related protein 2 in sex-specific sudden cardiac death in CAP2 mice."
"9386088","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Fibrosis is a pathobiological process common to many tissues and diseases which results in tissue remodeling and loss of function, often necessitating organ replacement or leading to end-stage disease. No therapies are currently available that successfully arrest or reverse fibrosis, and this represents a significant unmet clinical need. Fibrosis occurs predominantly in soft tissues (lung, liver, kidney, heart, skin) through excess fibroblast activation to a contractile/proliferative/apoptosis resistant state and accompanying deposition of extracellular matrix. We have discovered that fibroblasts are exquisitely sensitive to alterations in matrix stiffness; this finding is true for both normal and disease-derived fibroblasts, and spans the stiffness range found in normal and fibrotic lung tissue. In this project, we seek to dissect a novel molecular pathway linking matrix stiffness to fibroblast activation, and test whether this pathway is relevant in human fibrosis and essential in driving fibrosis in model systems. We focus on the transcriptional co-activators YAP and TAZ, evolutionarily conserved regulators of organ size, cell cycle, and stem cell function. Our preliminary data demonstrate enhanced nuclear localization of YAP/TAZ in human IPF tissue, and strongly support an essential role for YAP and TAZ in fibroblast activation downstream of both matrix stiffness and TGF-beta, two pivotal regulators of fibroblast biology. We hypothesize that YAP and TAZ are mechanically activated regulators of lung fibrosis that coordinate and integrate fibroblast matrix stiffness and biochemical responses leading to a cascade of pro-fibrotic functions that drive progressive fibrosis. We will evaluate this hypothesis in two aims using in vitro, mouse and human tissue models relevant to human disease. The proposed studies will advance the field by elucidating a novel point of convergence linking mechanical and biochemical cues to fibroblast activation and pulmonary fibrosis. If successful, the proposed studies could lead to new avenues for development of therapies targeting YAP and TAZ in fibrosis of the lung and other soft tissues."
"9393834","ABSTRACT We propose to use an agent-based modeling approach to elucidate specific mechanisms underlying alcohol-related problems and provide a framework for developing comprehensive preventive interventions at the community level. Agent-based models are a tool to assess the health impacts of specific social mechanisms that support alcohol problems in community settings within a framework in which drinkers move through their environments (e.g., commute to home or school) and interact with each other and their environments in ecologically realistic ways (e.g., eat dinner with their families at home). This modeling process demands a high level of precision with regard to theoretical statements of social processes and makes explicit those processes in which we might creatively intervene to reduce problems, setting a high bar for scientific explanation. In this Center component, we will use the Framework for Reconstructing Epidemiologic Dynamics (FRED) platform, an agent-based model with realistic, open-access Census-based synthetic populations that capture the demographic and geographic heterogeneities of the population of the United States down to the Census Block level and allows agents to co-evolve with physical and social environments. We will: (1) Apply a behavioral risk model framework within FRED in order to help clarify specific social ecological mechanisms that underlie the etiology of alcohol-related problems in California communities; and (2) Develop a select set of scenarios to alter social ecological mechanisms related to drinking contexts and assess their effects on alcohol-related problems using the FRED platform. We will extend FRED?s capacities to include unique agent-environment dynamics typical of behavioral risk models related to alcohol use, alcohol use disorders, and related problems. A simulation platform must have a core set of capabilities in order to undertake the development of these behavioral risk models. These include the ability to model individual heterogeneities, heterogeneous agent interactions, and environmental heterogeneity, all of which are built into FRED. We will construct a set of models that accurately describe drinking agents, drinker movements, drinking environments, and specific risks within specific environments. Once the models have been constructed, we will change one element (e.g., increase the number of bars in a community by 10%) and measure how it impacts our outcomes of interest. We will apply this modeling approach to at least five kinds of problems based on current and prior Center Grant research: (a) Parents? abuse and neglect of their children; (b) Early initiation of alcohol use and youth drinking problems (Component #3); (c) Health impacts related to hyper-availability of alcohol at the US-Mexico border (Component #4); (d) AUDs, heavy drinking and problems related to drinking outside the home (Component #5); and (e) The impact of social host ordinances on underage heavy drinking. BRMs allow for the integration of drinking agents and behaviors with drinking contexts?an essential step in designing and implementing effective strategies to prevent and reduce drinking problems within community systems. They make explicit those processes in which we might creatively intervene to reduce problems."
"9386060","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long term goal of this line of investigation is to identify the factors that can provide inherent protection to the endothelium during the initial stages of atherosclerosis and inflammation. In this proposal, we will focus on NOTCH1, a cell surface receptor and transcription factor that, based on preliminary data, provides an anti-inflammatory phenotype to quiescent (homeostatic) endothelium. NOTCH1 is constitutively expressed by the adult endothelium of mouse and human vessels in vivo. Reduction of NOTCH1 transcripts in human endothelium in vitro or genetic inactivation of Notch1 in mice triggers an inflammatory response in the absence of any additional insult. Exposure of endothelial cells to Western diet, oxidized phospholipids (Ox- PAPC), as well as inflammatory cytokines, results in a rapid reduction in endogenous NOTCH1 (together with its target genes). Using microarray analyses of endothelial cells from 147 human donors, we observed differences in basal and Ox-PAPC treated levels of NOTCH1 and identified a locus that was associated with the response of endothelial cells to NOTCH1 by Ox-PAPC. This same locus was also associated with HDL levels in a large scale GWAS including 100,000 humans. Studies in this project will test the hypothesis that reduction of NOTCH1 by circulating lipids contributes to the prolonged inflammation typical of atherosclerosis lesions. In fact, reduction of NOTCH1 levels in an athero-susceptible background (Apoe or Ldlr null mice) promotes acceleration of atherosclerosis and results in larger lesions. Furthermore, genetic inactivation of Notch1 in the endothelium of adult mice leads to leukocyte infiltration, detachment and loss of endothelial cells from the intima. In addition and consistent with a role in endothelial homeostasis and suppression of inflammation, using a ChIP approach we found that NOTCH1 regulates tristetraprolin, an RNA binding protein that targets to AREs sequences in the 3'UTR causing destabilization of mRNAs encoding a cohort of inflammatory cytokines. The central hypothesis of this application is that NOTCH1 in the endothelium is essential to maintain an anti-inflammatory interface between blood and tissue. To test this hypothesis, we propose two specific aims: 1. To determine the mechanism(s) that control NOTCH1 expression and function in adult arterial endothelium; and 2. To identify the molecular pathways by which NOTCH1 maintains an anti-inflammatory status in the endothelium of quiescent arteries."
"9440912","PROJECT SUMMARY Acute survival following myocardial infarction has precipitated a growing heart failure epidemic, warranting de- velopment of disease-altering treatments to restore tissue integrity and ventricular function. The homeostatic capability for self-renewal in the adult human heart is insufficient in the setting of myocardial injury. Adult stem cell therapies, conceived to bolster this innate regenerative reserve and achieve clinically meaningful cardiac regeneration, have been found safe but demonstrate inconsistent benefit in ischemic cardiomyopathy. This recognized roadblock impedes the roll-out of cardiac regenerative medicine in clinical practice. To prime re- generative proficiency, our team initially introduced the lineage-specifying cardiopoiesis platform. Despite this optimization, a range of benefit following cardiopoietic stem cell therapy was experienced in two separate clini- cal trials. Exploiting the C-CURE and CHART-1 trial experience, preliminary work documented an altered mi- croRNA and secretome landscape germane to cardiopoietic stem cells that yielded the best outcomes in hu- man testing. Use of clinical readouts in conjunction with systems biology deconvolution of trial-biobanked car- diopoietic stem cell samples underpins an innovative approach to target pathways that drive regenerative ac- tion. The overarching hypothesis of the present proposal is that the molecular roadmap segregating high re- generative properties can be actuated to reverse engineer stem cells featuring enhanced regenerative profi- ciency. Thus, a clinical trial-informed paradigm is here introduced to dial-up the regenerative aptitude of stem cells. The proposal aims to: (1) engineer a highly regenerative cardiopoietic (hrCP) phenotype through targeted microRNA programming to achieve enhanced regenerative efficacy tested in murine ischemic cardiomyopathy; (2) establish mechanisms underlying hrCP action through a proteomic systems approach resolving impact on the disease substrate with focus on neovasculogenesis as a prioritized tissue compartment in repair; and final- ly (3) scale-up hrCP for translation in a porcine model of ischemic heart failure with molecular and functional imaging tracking biodistribution and therapeutic effectiveness, along with histological and high-throughput analysis, to demonstrate bioequivalency in clinically relevant conditions. Timely execution of stated aims is fa- cilitated by a multidisciplinary team with a track record in translating stem cell innovation, established method- ologies and resources, and a body of supporting preliminary work. On completion, the proposed research will realize the prospect of a clinomics-informed evolution in stem cell therapy for ischemic heart failure delivering an engineered and validated highly regenerative biotherapy."
"9424601","The unprecedented 2014?2015 Ebola virus (EBOV) outbreak in West Africa has highlighted the urgent, unfulfilled need for vaccines and therapeutics to prevent and treat infections by EBOV and other filoviruses. However, their development is challenged by crucial gaps in our understanding of the virus-host molecular interactions that underpin filovirus infection, disease, and transmission. Recent work on the entry mechanism of filoviruses has revealed that these agents are prototypic members of a group of `late-penetrating' viruses that extensively exploit host endo/lysosomal factors and pathways to invade cells. During the previous grant period, we found that host endosomal cysteine proteases (cysteine cathepsins) program the viral glycoprotein GP to bind the endosomal cholesterol transporter Niemann-Pick C1 (NPC1), which we showed to be an essential intracellular entry receptor. Despite these and other discoveries, however, the culminating steps in filovirus entry?GP-mediated fusion between viral and cellular lipid bilayers, and cytoplasmic escape of the viral nucleocapsid core?remain enigmatic. The overarching goals of this renewal application are to define the molecular mechanism of filovirus membrane fusion, and to identify new filovirus entry host factors with antiviral potential. To fulfill these objectives, the principal investigator has assembled a multidisciplinary team that includes a field leader in the chemical biology of proteases, a leading expert on the biogenesis and functions of endosomes and lysosomes, and a virologist who will extend findings with surrogate viruses to authentic filoviruses. Together we will: (1) Define viral and cellular requirements for filovirus membrane fusion, dissect steps in the fusion reaction, and identify the elusive filovirus fusion trigger factor(s). (2) Determine the roles of newly- identified host factors in viral trafficking to membrane fusion sites, and employ proteomic approaches to uncover novel host factors involved in filovirus membrane fusion."
"9395926","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The molecular mechanisms that control unremitting lung fibrosis remain poorly understood, resulting in the unfortunate fact that targeted therapies for pulmonary fibrosis are lacking. This proposal focuses on elucidating the roles of ?rrestins (?r1 and ?r2) in regulating lung injury and fibrosis and to determining the feasibility that targeting ?rrestins as a novel therapeutic approach for lung fibrosis. Progressinve lung injury and fibrosis is a cause of major morbidity and mortality as in the case of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). We have demonstrated the roles of extracellular matrix (ECM), innate immune, and chemokine receptors in regulating lung injury and fibrosis. We recently identified that ?r1 and ?r2 play a role in fibrogenesis by regulating fibroblast invasiveness. ?rrestins are adaptor proteins for G-protein coupled receptors, some of which have been suggested to play a key role in lung fibrogenesis. One of the pathologic hallmarks of IPF is the destruction of basement membrane. In the bleomycin-induced mouse lung fibrosis model, loss of either ?r1 or ?r2 results in protection from mortality, inhibition of matrix deposition, and protected lung function. However, isolated lung fibroblasts from bleomycin-treated ?rrestin null mice fail to invade ECM while displaying altered expression of genes involved in matrix production and degradation. These data implicate ?rrestins as mediators of fibroblast invasion and development of pulmonary fibrosis, thus representing a potential target for therapeutic intervention for patients with IPF. Our data further showed that genes related to basement membrane degradation and cell-matrix adhesion were altered in ?rrestin deficient fibroblasts. Interestingly, ALL 13 these genes are regulated by transcription factor MyoD, 12 by oncogene Maf. Both MyoD and Maf have been shown to play a key role in cell differentiation by promoting cell cycle arrest. Our data suggest that MyoD and Maf interact with ?rs and regulate fibroblast invasion. Based on these data we have generated the hypothesis that (1) progressive lung fibrosis requires the the presence of ?rrestins and (2) ?rrestins complex with transcription factors MyoD and Maf leading to the development of a pathogenic fibroblast phenotype that invades tissue and transmits signals from the ECM to fibroblasts. We will test this hypothesis to determine the roles of ?rrestins of different cell types in regulating lung fibrosis; determine te role of MyoD-Maf in regulating ?r2-mediated fibroblast activation and fibrogenesis, as well as investigate the effect of the blockage of ?rrestin signaling on pulmonary fibrosis."
"9386078","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There are at least 500,000 victims of cardiac arrest each year in the United States. In the majority of these patients, the initial rhythm is not ventricular fibrillation (VF) or ventricular tachycardia (VT), but is pulseless electrical activity (PEA) or asystole. The survival rates for VT/VF arrests average around 20%. The survival rates for PEA and asystolic arrests are much lower, however, and average only around 5%. There is a critical need, therefore, for improved resuscitation strategies, since each 1% increase in survival rate would result in approximately 5000 additional survivors. This critical need is most apparent with PEA arrests, since little is known about the pathophysiology or the optimal treatment of these arrests, especially when compared to VT/VF arrests. Defibrillation is the definitive treatment for VT/VF arrest, but is not indicated in PEA arrest. We present the novel hypothesis that most PEA arrests are due to failure of ventricular muscle from acute ischemia and/or hypoxia in a substrate where there has been chronic ischemia and/or hypoxia. This contrasts with most VT/VF arrests where acute ischemia causes VT/VF in a healthier substrate. We further hypothesize that this chronic ischemia and/or hypoxia induces preconditioning, which prevents or delays the occurrence of VF, resulting in PEA arrest. We hypothesize, therefore, that therapy for PEA arrests must be directed at reversing this profound ischemia and/or hypoxia, as well as mitigating reperfusion injury. Even though there may be preconditioning, such preconditioning may not be uniform. In addition, the already severe compromise of the metabolic status of the heart would make any degree of reperfusion injury more detrimental in PEA arrests than in VT/VF arrests. Therapy should, therefore, be directed at generating substantial blood flow during resuscitation, including the use of vasodilators, to reverse the profound ischemia that may be present. Methods for augmenting blood flow should include the use of improved external compression devices, which may be particularly useful for treating out-of-hospital arrests; and the use of extracorporeal systems, which may be particularly useful for in-hospital arrests. Controlled reperfusion, including post conditioning, may be necessary at the beginning of reperfusion to reduce reperfusion injury. Additional preservation strategies may also be useful, including intra-arrest hypothermia. Finally, we hypothesize that each of these strategies will have incremental and additive improvement in outcomes from PEA cardiac arrest. The goals of this project are to improve our understanding of the pathophysiology of PEA cardiac arrest, develop improved methods for augmenting blood flow during resuscitation, and also develop synergistic, improved strategies for mitigating the effects of the profound ischemia and/or hypoxia present in PEA arrest. These studies should provide new information and insights about the pathophysiology of PEA cardiac arrests, and may lead to substantial improvements in the now dismal outcomes from PEA cardiac arrests."
"9446610","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS) have emerged in the US market, with use and awareness rapidly increasing in recent years, particularly in young adults. While ENDS may facilitate harm reduction in smokers, ENDS represent significant health risks, including addiction in the nicotine-nave (e.g., young adults). From a socioecologic perspective, the literature regarding tobacco retail indicates that place characteristics such as neighborhood demography and policy context influence retailer location and marketing, and these factors impact individual tobacco use. However, this literature is in its infancy in regard to ENDS and particularly to vape shops, which are stores exclusively devoted to ENDS sales. Vape shops have proliferated in the US and are unique in their product offerings, marketing, and overall retail environment (e.g., tasting bars). Vape shops, as well as the 2nd and 3rd generation ENDS they sell, have particular appeal to young adults. A particularly important and timely macro-level factor that may impact ENDS use and distribution channels is the impending FDA Deeming Regulation on ENDS and other tobacco products. The Deeming Regulation involves a range of policies implemented in the next 3 years (e.g., mandatory age verification and prohibiting free samples beginning in Aug 2016, mandatory health warning labels effective Aug 2018, manufacturers required to submit a new tobacco product application by Aug 2018, etc.). These regulations are likely to impact vape shop survival as well as their marketing and the overall vape shop experience, given young adults are the biggest segment of vape shop clientele (who will require ID), the social experience of tasting bars (which will no longer be allowed), and the history of ENDS being promoted as safe and for cessation or harm reduction (with products and ads requiring health warnings). A well-integrated program of research is needed to examine the multilevel impact of regulation on ENDS retailers, as well as on ENDS marketing, specifically among vape shops, given that they are a unique retail settings that have a particular impact on young adult ENDS use. Leveraging a Socioecological Framework, we will draw data from 6 metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs) representing the CDC-defined regions and the gradient of tobacco control in order to address 3 inter-related aims: 1) examine density and survival of vape shops over time and across contexts in relation to FDA regulation, local policies, and other sociocontextual factors (e.g., neighborhood context, density/proximity of convenience stores); 2) examine vape shop marketing and POS practices (e.g., age verification, free sampling, health warnings) over time and across contexts in relation to FDA regulation, local policies, and other sociocontextual factors (e.g., neighborhood context, density/proximity of convenience stores); and 3) examine young adult ENDS use over time and across contexts in relation to spatial access to vape shops and convenience stores, ENDS advertising exposure, local policies, and sociocontextual factors. This research will document the impact of regulation on this industry and provide an evidence base for legislation regarding zoning and vape shop marketing/POS practices to protect high-risk populations. We will disseminate findings with an explicit focus on informing public health policy and practice regarding ENDS, as well as future research."
"9472481","Summary Cardiovascular diseases like myocardial infarction (MI) are the leading cause of mortality in patients with diabetes. In infarcted heart, efficient clearance of dying cells (called efferocytosis) by activated neighboring phagocytes (primarily infiltrating macrophages) is essential for inflammation resolution and tissue repair. However, improper clearance of dying cells leads to secondary postapoptotic necrosis and therefore may precipitate the transition to heart failure. Our preliminary study demonstrates that diabetic condition impairs efferocytosis of dead cardiomyocytes by macrophages, in vitro and in human diabetic heart as compared to non-diabetics. However, the molecular players in diabetes-mediated defective efferocytosis and its effect on cardiac remodeling and outcome are surprisingly not studied yet. Therefore, studying the mechanisms of diabetes-mediated impairment in efferocytosis of dead cells (specifically cardiomyocytes) and strategies to enhance resolution of inflammation leading to efficient cardiac healing and recovery are clinically relevant and therapeutically novel. In this regard, therapy with paracrine factors (exosomes) from mesenchymal stem cells (MSC), a potent immunomodulator and clinically tested for safety and efficacy in ischemic heart failure patients, holds great promise. However, the effect of MSC and its derivatives on macrophage efferocytosis of cardiomyocytes either with or without diabetes in a small/larger animal model of MI has never been studied so far. Our preliminary data shows that MSC- derived exosomes increase macrophage efferocytosis of dead cardiomyocytes, in vitro. Based on these preliminary data coupled with our published and existing literature, our central hypothesis is that i) diabetes impairs macrophage efferocytosis of dead cardiomyocytes leading to delay in resolution of inflammation and cardiac repair in diabetics, ii) MSC-derived exosomes are enriched in factors (RNA/miRNA/proteins) that promote efferocytosis, therefore iii) intramyocardial delivery of MSC- derived exosomes in a small/large animal model of MI enhances efferocytosis and wound healing leading to efficient regeneration and repair. We will test our hypotheses under the following three aims: Aim 1: Determine the effect of diabetes on clearance of dead cardiomyocyte (efferocytosis) after myocardial ischemic injury. Aim 2: Elucidate the molecular mechanism of MSC-exosome effect on macrophage-mediated efferocytosis. Aim 3: a. Delineate the invivo effect of MSC-exosome on efferocytosis after myocardial infarction a) in mice and b) in a translationally realistic large animal (pig) model of heart failure."
"9390483","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Abstract: Chronic immune activation, which can persist even with antiretroviral therapy, is the strongest predictor of disease progression in HIV infection. Understanding the mechanism of chronic immune activation may help identify novel targets for therapeutic interventions in HIV-infection. Extensive evidence from literature suggests that HIV disease directly or indirectly activates monocyte/macrophages to secrete proinflammatory cytokines which play a major role in this pathogenic immune activation. Monocytes from HIV infected individuals are known to secrete cytokines spontaneously, although the mechanism for this or the molecules involved are not known. PD-1H is a newly discovered member of the B7/CD28 family of costimulatory and coinhibitory receptors, which has not been characterized in humans so far. Data to date suggest that the molecule may be derived from a different precursor than all other B7 family members. Although, amongst the B7/CD28 family, the full length sequence of PD-1H has the highest similarity to the negative regulatory molecule PD-1, unlike PD-1, the cytoplasmic domain of PD-1H does not contain the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif (ITIM) or the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based switch motif (ITSM). Our preliminary data shows that PD- 1H is broadly expressed on hematopoietic cells with higher levels of expression on monocytes. Enforced overexpression of PD-1H in human monocytes is sufficient to induce spontaneous secretion of multiple cytokines. Further, monocytes from HIV-infected individuals overexpress PD-1H which correlates with cytokine gene expression in monocytes and immune activation markers on T cells but not with viral load. Based on these data, we hypothesize that PD-1H acts as a monocyte activation molecule that plays a major role in HIV pathogenesis. In this proposal we will test this hypothesis and evaluate how ART influences this process using PBMCs from defined stages of HIV disease and humanized BLT model which recapitulates key features of HIV pathogenesis, including immune activation. Our specific aims are to: 1) To characterize the evolution of PD-1h over expression in relation to immune activation, plasma proinflammatory cytokine levels, CD4 T cell depletion and plasma viremia using defined groups of HIV infected individuals. 2) Characterize PD-1H expression at different time points during the course of HIV infection in humanized BLT mice vis-?-vis viral load, CD4 T cell counts and immune activation defined by monocyte associated biomarkers/cytokines and activation markers on T cells. We will also test how PD-1H expression changes after ART, in relation to other parameters and 3) Test if silencing PD-1H or related molecules in humanized mice reverses immune activation or affects other parameters of HIV infection with or without ART."
"9435887","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) requires the ESX-5 specialized protein secretion system for both nutrient uptake and virulence, but the ESX-5 effectors that directly influence nutrient acquisition or interactions with host cells are currently undefined. The long-term goal is to understand the mechanisms that enable Mtb to evade host immune defenses to establish and maintain persistent infections. The objective of this proposal is to identify ESX-5 substrates that impact Mtb pathogenesis. The proposed research will test the central hypothesis that ESX-5 secretes many substrates and that proteins encoded within the esx-5 locus directly influence Mtb virulence, independent of a function in nutrient acquisition. This proposal will utilize unique genetic tools to dissect the function of the ESX-5 secretion system. Preliminary data demonstrate substantial alterations in the secreted protein profile of a mutant that hyper-secretes the known ESX-5 substrates. Specific Aim 1 will make use of this ESX-5 hyper-secretion mutant, growth conditions that stimulate ESX-5 secretion and strains that conditionally express core components of the ESX-5 secretion system to globally identify ESX- 5 substrates by a proteomics approach. Specific Aim 2 will test the importance of the mycobacteria-specific PE, PPE and Esx proteins that are encoded within the esx-5 locus for Mtb virulence using a series of Mtb deletion mutants and both mouse and macrophage infection models. The results of these studies will significantly enhance our understanding of the Mtb host-pathogen interaction by revealing proteins that are secreted via ESX-5 and identifying individual ESX-5-associated proteins that are required for virulence. Identification of functional ESX-5 effectors will enable detailed molecular characterization of the mechanisms by which these proteins manipulate host cell functions to facilitate design of novel antimicrobials to combat tuberculosis infection."

"9397148","Project Summary  The conserved DNA mismatch repair (MMR) pathway repairs replication errors and reduces the mutational burden for organisms. In humans, MMR defects are found in some spontaneous cancers and in Lynch syndrome, also known as hereditary non-polyposis colon cancer and biallelic MMR deficiency syndrome, which are cancer predisposition syndromes. The fundamental unanswered question in eukaryotic MMR is how repair is targeted to the newly synthesized DNA strand. Strand discrimination is a crucial step in MMR, because repair mistakenly targeting the template strand would permanently fix the error in the genome. Accumulating evidence suggests that the Mlh1-Pms1 endonuclease, which is recruited to sites of error containing DNA by the mispair recognition factor Msh2-Msh6, plays a key role during eukaryotic strand discrimination. Furthermore, nucleotide-induced conformational changes in both complexes appear to play important roles during Mlh1-Pms1 recruitment and endonuclease activation, though the mechanism behind these events, as well as the role of Mlh1-Pms1 endonuclease activity during MMR, is unclear. However, one possible explanation is that recruitment and activation of Mlh1-Pms1 endonuclease activity function during strand discrimination to identify the newly synthesized DNA strand. Using newly developed techniques and building upon recent data, this proposal aims to examine Mlh1-Pms1 involvement during MMR and its potential role during strand discrimination by: (1) analyzing the role of nucleotide induced Msh2-Msh6 conformational changes during recruitment of Mlh1-Pms1 onto mispaired DNA (2) assessing the role of conformational changes in Mlh1-Pms1 for its recruitment and endonuclease activity, and (3) assessing interactions of Mlh1- Pms1 with pre-existing nicks in DNA to probe their possible role in strand discrimination. Mutant proteins and alleles will be utilized to examine the role of nucleotide-induced conformational changes in the Msh2-Msh6 and Mlh1-Pms1 complexes during recruitment and activation of Mlh1-Pms1 endonuclease activity using biochemical and genetic techniques previously utilized by the Kolodner laboratory. Mutant proteins will also be used to examine the role of Mlh1-Pms1 interaction with nicks and the role of Mlh1-Pms1 endonuclease activity using in vitro assays developed for this study. Completion of this proposal will make significant progress towards understanding the mechanistic role of Mlh1-Pms1 during MMR as well as identification of the eukaryotic strand discrimination signal."
"9394818","Reactive oxygen species (ROS), such as H2O2 derived from NADPH oxidase (NOX) act as signaling molecules to promote VEGF-induced angiogenesis in ECs and post-ischemic neovascularization. Fundamental question remains ?how diffusible H2O2 signal can be efficiently transmitted to promote therapeutic angiogenesis.? Signaling function of ROS is through oxidation of reactive Cys residues to generate ?Cysteine sulfenic acid (Cys- OH)? which is involved in disulfide bond formation and redox signaling. Protein Disulfide Isomerase (PDI) functions as oxidase, reductase and isomerase depending on redox environment. ?PDIA1? is a major PDI isoform with four reactive Cys residues in redox active domains. Given redox properties of PDI, PDI may function as redox sensor in ROS-dependent VEGF signaling to enhance therapeutic angiogenesis and maintain endothelial metabolic states. Preliminary Data found that PDIA1+/- mice or diabetes mice with reduced PDIA1 expression show impaired reparative angiogenesis, indicating in vivo significance of PDIA1. In primary ECs, VEGF stimulation increases Cys-OH formation of various proteins, which was markedly decreased by PDIA1 siRNA. Experiments using 2D gel assay and searching for binding partner of PDIA1 discovered that PDIA1 functions as a redox sensor in ROS-dependent VEGF signaling to promote Cys oxidation/activation of AMPK, a key regulator of cell metabolism and angiogenesis, via disulfide bond formation. Moreover, in quiescent basal ECs, PDIA1 knockdown unexpectedly induced mitochondrial fragmentation and EC senescence without inducing ER stress via increasing Cys oxidation of Drp1, a key fission GTPase. We thus hypothesize that PDIA1 functions as key redox adaptor/reductase for Drp1 to maintain mitochondrial dynamics in quiescent ECs as well as redox sensor when it is Cys oxidized to transduce VEGF-induced H2O2 signal to promote oxidative activation of AMPK via disulfide bond formation, thereby enhancing endothelial metabolism and angiogenesis in ECs. This is required for full neovascularization in ischemic vascular disease. Aim 1 will determine the molecular mechanisms by which PDIA1 senses VEGF-induced H2O2 signal to promote EC metabolism and angiogenesis via oxidative activation of AMPK, which is impaired in diabetic ECs. Aim2 will examine whether PDIA1 maintains mitochondrial dynamics via binding to Drp1 to keep it in reduced/inactive state in quiescent ECs, thereby preventing mitochondrial fragmentation and ECs dysfunction in diabetes. Aim 3 will determine the in vivo role of endothelial PDIA1 in ROS-dependent reparative neovascularization, which is impaired in diabetes. We will use biotin-labelled Cys-OH trapping probe; BiFC-based molecular protein interaction imaging; mitochondrial dynamics imaging; EC-specific PDIA1-/- or diabetic mice; and gene transfer of EC-targeted Cys oxidation defective mutants of PDIA1, AMPK and Drp1. Our proposal will provide novel insights into Cys reduced/oxidized proteins and Cys oxidation-mediated molecular interaction as potential therapeutic targets for treatment of ischemic cardiovascular metabolic diseases."

"9592082","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed study examines the impact and cost associated with an innovative intervention to increase adherence to HIV treatment for HIV-infected (HIV+) adolescents (hereafter Suubi+Adherence). Suubi+Adherence is informed by an efficacious economic empowerment intervention previously tested with AIDS-orphaned children, Suubi-Uganda, and draws from Asset-Theory and previous adherence studies. Suubi+Adherence aims to: 1) promote income-generating activities -- also known as microenterprises -- for poor HIV+ adolescents and their families so that there is sufficient income to meet the specific financial needs associated with managing HIV as a chronic illness and; 2) provide support for adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART). Studies from Uganda, and much of sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) indicate that one group disproportionately affected by HIV is economically vulnerable children. For this population, adherence to treatment regimens may require a level of economic stability that many youth do not experience. Indeed, the commonly cited reasons for non-adherence are economic in nature, such as lack of resources for medication, transportation to attend clinic appointments, and food and nutritional supplements. Poor children are less likely to adhere to ART and other health-related regimens. Yet, to date, no adherence interventions have focused on the underlying economic drivers, which might help explain why results of adherence interventions with HIV+ adolescents in poverty have had small to moderate effects at best. The proposed study will randomly assign 736 HIV+ adolescents (ages 12 to 15 years at study entry) under the care of 32 health clinics in Rakai, Masaka, and Lwengo Districts of southern Uganda - districts heavily affected by HIV/AIDS - to one of two study conditions: Suubi+Adherence vs. bolstered standard of care (SOC). Assessments will be conducted at baseline, and 12, 24, 36, and 48-months post-intervention initiation. More specifically, we will: 1) examine the impact of the Suubi+Adherence intervention on key adherence to HIV treatment regimen outcomes for HIV+ adolescents, including: participants' ability to access and refill prescribed medication and keep to prescribed daily medication routines: a) not skipping doses, b) taking doses at the right times, c) participants' health literay and health behaviors (e.g. keeping medical appointments, following nutritional recommendations), d) CD4, and HIV-related biomarkers (CD4 T-cell count and viral load); 2) explore the impact of the Suubi+Adherence intervention on potential mechanisms of protective health behaviors, knowledge, and beliefs (e.g. financial stability, sexual risk-taking behavior, personal beliefs about medication, hopelessness, future plans and aspirations, self-efficacy); and 3) examine the costs associated with the Suubi+Adherence. The study will advance knowledge and inform the development of programs aimed at increasing adherence to HIV treatment for HIV+ adolescents in low-resource regions such as SSA. The study will provide crucial evidence about the effects of an economic empowerment program on short, and long-term impacts."
"9447051","! ABSTRACT Detection of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) at or close to surgical margins increases the risk of death at 5-years by 90%. However, large surgical margins to ensure clear margins can greatly increase a patient's morbidity with functional and cosmetic damage of oral and facial structures. Although promising, single fluorescence agents targeting epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) are qualitative at best, have moderate tumor-to-normal tissue contrast, and have not yet demonstrated long-term improved patient outcomes. Our recently developed in vivo paired-agent imaging method allows quantification of extracellular receptor expression (and identification of cancerous tissue) by utilizing simultaneously delivered targeted and non-targeted (i.e., perfusion) agents to reference the plasma delivery and leakage. The ability to eliminate the non-binding fluorescence contribution in the tumor and surrounding normal tissues increases the observed tumor-to-normal tissue contrast and improves our ability to observe microscopic tissue burden. The central HYPOTHESIS is that EGFR targeted Paired-Agent Imaging for Resection During Surgery (PAIRS) will improve HNSCC patient long-term survival and decrease morbidity. The ultimate RESEARCH GOAL is to demonstrate that PAIRS outperforms both traditional (non-guided) and single, fluorescent-agent guided surgical resection in detecting microscopic tumor in surgical margins of a spontaneous HNSCC patient-surrogate model. Clinical translation of PAIRS will be fully realized by completion of the outlined SPECIFIC AIMS: Aim 1 - Develop clinic-ready integrated FGS system for HNSCC PAIRS under operating room lights; Aim 2 - Optimize the PAIRS model in HNSCC tumors and derive clinical imaging parameters; and Aim 3 - Validate the clinical viability of PAIRS in both murine xenografts and spontaneous, volunteer dog  model as compared to traditional and single, fluorescent-agent guided surgical resection. The translational INNOVATION will include production of a fully integrated PAIRS system, and a robust set of clinical imaging parameters. To expedite clinical translation of PAIRS, we will leverage two fluorescent agents currently being used in clinical trials: ABY-029 (a fluorescent anti-EGFR Affibody molecule) and IRDye 700DX. In addition, the clinical SIGNIFICANCE of PAIRS to reduce morbidity and increase survival will have been demonstrated in both the controlled environment of murine xenografts as well as the high variability of spontaneous veterinary cancers in dogs. As a translational biophysical chemist, I have lead the development of the paired-agent model as a tissue identifying technique and have assembled a strong team of notable cancer and clinical imaging researchers. !"
"9404045","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF) is a lethal fibrotic lung disorder that kills 40,000 Americans each year and over 1 million persons worldwide. In IPF, relentless expansion and alteration of the alveolar mesenchymal cell population leads to production of diseased myofibroblasts that mediate progressive scarring of the gas exchange surface resulting in death by asphyxiation. Fibroblasts derived from the lungs of IPF patients have phenotypic hallmarks that distinguish them from their normal counterparts. IPF fibroblasts have altered integrin expression, are hyperproliferative, produce increased amounts of collagen, express increased amounts of ?mooth muscle actin (?MA) and form fibrotic lesions in model organisms. We recently published that pathological lung mesenchymal progenitor cells (MPCs) are a cell-of-origin for the IPF fibroblast; and that IPF extracellular matrix (ECM) reprograms fibroblast gene expression to establish a positive feedback loop that translationally activates ECM genes and their cognate cell surface receptors. In this project we summarize our paradigm-shifting data. First, we show that IPF lungs MPCs - but not control lung MPCs - generate progeny with the in vitro and in vivo hallmarks of IPF fibroblasts. Next, we show that when primary lung fibroblasts (IPF or control) interact with decellularized lung ECM (IPF or control): i) the ECM source predominantly dictates gene expression; ii) IPF lung ECM translationally activates ECM genes and genes encoding their cognate integrin receptors; and iii) IPF lung ECM, but not control ECM, decreases fibroblast expression of miR29 - a potent negative regulator of ECM and proliferation genes - creating a positive feedback loop that provides a molecular mechanism for relentless disease progression. Based on this, we hypothesize that decellularized IPF lung ECM will direct human lung MPC differentiation towards the IPF phenotype; and stabilize that phenotype by epigenetic regulation of miR29 expression to create a positive feedback loop driving genes governing IPF fibroblast hallmarks. We propose 2 specific aims to elucidate the molecular mechanisms. Specific Aim 1: Genesis of the IPF fibroblast - Characterize the mechanisms by which MPCs acquire IPF phenotypic hallmarks on IPF lung ECM. Specific Aim 2: Disease Progression - Dissect the molecular and cellular mechanisms of the IPF ECM-driven positive feedback loop that increases integrin and ECM gene expression and suppresses their negative regulator, miR29. If we achieve our aims, our work will unveil mechanisms governing the genesis, maintenance and propagation of the IPF fibroblast and its pathological ECM. This information is foundational for developing therapies that target those ECM - mesenchymal cell interactions that drive IPF."

"9398148","Project Summary/ Abstract Differences in both high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol abundance and function likely impact the cardiovascular protective potential of HDL. HDL classically mediates reverse cholesterol transport (RCT) to the liver via processes that include the binding of apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I) in HDL to scavenger receptor class B, type I (SR-BI) in hepatocytes. Other actions of the HDL/SR-BI tandem may also be protective, such as their capacity to activate endothelial NO production and repair via kinase signaling that uniquely requires the adaptor protein PDZK1. However, we surprisingly discovered that endothelial- specific SR-BI deletion in apoE-/- mice, which have high VLDL/LDL and low HDL, results in decreased atherosclerosis. We have further discovered that this is related to a >80% decline in LDL delivery to the artery wall, revealing the mechanism underlying a critical step in atherogenesis. As such, there may be a dichotomous role for endothelial SR-BI in atherosclerosis, promoting it in the setting of low HDL yet affording atheroprotection in the setting of high HDL. This novel concept and its mechanistic underpinnings will be interrogated in mice and in human endothelial cells. Aim 1 is to compare how endothelial SR-BI influences atherosclerosis in the setting of relatively low vs. high HDL. Atherosclerosis will be evaluated with vs. without endothelial SR-BI and HDL raised via transgenic expression of human apoA-I, and findings will be compared with those made with low HDL. The impact of endothelial SR-BI signaling on atherosclerosis will also be evaluated at low vs. high HDL by deleting endothelial PDZK1. Aim 2 is to determine the roles of endothelial SR-BI and PDZK1 in the putative atheroprotective actions of HDL. To assess HDL's anti-inflammatory actions in vivo, endothelial cell-leukocyte adhesion will be evaluated by intravital microscopy, and HDL, SR-BI and PDZK1 modulation of endothelial genes that influence vascular inflammation will also be interrogated. The roles of endothelial SR-BI and PDZK1 in RCT will be determined in models that query processes in both blood and lymphatic endothelium, and in both microvasculature and arteries. Aim 3 is to determine how endothelial SR-BI governs artery wall LDL deposition. LDL uptake will be studied in cultured endothelium expressing mutant forms of SR-BI with specific loss-of-function for lipid flux, sensing of plasma membrane cholesterol movement, or C-terminal protein interaction. Further studies in culture will evaluate possible roles of other LDL receptors, and co- trafficking of LDL and SR-BI across the endothelium. Aorta LDL uptake will be evaluated in vivo in models testing the role of PDZK1, the impact of elevated HDL, and if pharmacologic intervention targeting SR-BI can decrease LDL deposition. By accomplishing these aims, we will elucidate how vascular health is influenced by endothelial SR-BI, which may be a critical point of intersection of atherosclerosis modulation by HDL and LDL. The new knowledge gained will potentially identify novel therapies for atherosclerosis."
"9492347","Abstract The functional integrity of the nuclear pore complex (NPC) is achieved through the fastening to the pore membrane (POM) proteins. This interlocked zipper of proteins is important to maintain nuclear transport and allow proper progression through the cell cycle. NPCs are disassembled into nucleoporins (Nup) subcomplexes during entry into open mitosis in higher eukaryotic cells. POM proteins have been shown to affect cell cycle progression and to be involved in several disease states such as leukemia, heart disease and types of progeria. We hypothesize that Nup/POM interfaces are regulated by mitotic kinases at disassembly leading to their release and mitotic localization. To study this we propose: The determination of key phosphorylation interface targets and pairing them as substrates for kinases involved in disassembly and distribution of the NPC. We will identify and test these regulated areas including constraint-based modeling from our phosphorylation/interaction mapping. This work will be the key prerequisite to understand NPC regulation and distribution throughout the cell cycle."
"9392861","DESCRIPTION: HIV-associated B cell defects are associated with an increased incidence of secondary infections, autoimmune disease and B cell lymphomas. High rates of infection, such as pneumococcal pneumonia and bacteremia, and poor responses to preventive vaccines among persons with HIV infection, even with antiretroviral therapy, may be related to an impaired ability of B cells to generate antibodies of sufficient quantity, quality and function to control these pathogens. The development of effective antibodies requires mutations in the antigen-binding hypervariable region to enhance binding to pathogens as well as changes in the conserved constant regions (switch from IgM to IgG or IgA) to enhance killing of organisms. Both of these effects are controlled by a pivotal molecule, activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID), in B cells in inductive sites in lymphoid tissue, the germinal centers (GC). HIV infection can have dramatic detrimental effects on the architecture and function of germinal centers as well as on B cells themselves. The consequence is the production of antibodies in low concentrations and with limited protective activity.  We propose to study B cell abnormalities in patients with HIV infection and control adults by characterizing B cell phenotype by multiparameter flow cytometry, expression, regulation and function of AID to support B cells in response to model stimuli in vitro as well as with in vivo challenge with pneumococcal vaccines. We utilize clinical, cellular and molecular approaches to understanding B cell defects during HIV infections and vaccines in the context of evaluating the potential protection afforded by the antibodies they elicit as well as in their role as controlled and targeted probes of integrated immune function."
"9382871","Our long-term goal is to elucidate the relationship between neural activity, sound processing, perception and behavior. We specifically propose to establish the relationship of neural activity to discriminating and detecting sound features in the primary auditory cortex (A1) and lateral belt of non-human subjects with the goal of reveling the transformations occurring as the auditory cortical hierarchy is ascended. We address the question: How do neuronal responses in auditory cortex relate to non-human subjects' psychophysical and behavioral performance in detecting the presence of sound modulation? The three aims are designed to compare three fundamental aspects related to these issues in A1 and in two lateral belt areas of auditory cortex to determine the changing emphasis of processing along the ascending cortical pathway. Aim 1 is to determine the neural basis of modulation detection. Aim 2 is to determine how neuron responses from auditory cortex are related to perception and behavioral choices. Aim 3 is to determine the effect of behavioral state and task-engagement on neurons ability to encode sound features. To achieve these aims, we will establish the quantitative relationships between single unit auditory cortical activity and the ability of neurons and non-human subjects to discriminate sounds, and determine what codes most likely underlie perceptual ability. We will also record from single units while non-human subjects discriminate sound to determine the role of primary and secondary sensory cortical areas in the transformation from sensation to task performance. This will give insight into how active engagement in a task improves neural processing ability at the single neuron level and whether primary sensory cortex receives information or is involved in the processes that lead to action. Because the proposal relates brain function to different parts of the brain it is relevant for a better understanding about how punctate brain damage such as that cause by stroke affects auditory function. The results of these studies will help us to better understand how attending sound modulates auditory activity and thus makes this basic science have relevance for the spectrum disorders (that include, but are not limited to attention deficit disorder, dyslexia, etc). The results also could have relevance in helping to guide approaches to coding for hearing aids and cochlear implants since both neural coding and the ability to focus on sounds are relevant for designing these devices."
"9605855","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): hERG encodes a potassium channel that is of essential importance to normal cardiac electrophysiology and rhythm control. Its biomedical significance is highlighted by its link to both hereditary (locus LQT2) and acquired Long-QT syndromes. Over 600 deleterious mutations (>440 missense) have been reported in hERG. Why the channel is so susceptible to missense mutations is not known. The majority of LQT2 hERG mutations are believed to result in defective assembly and trafficking to the cell surface-presumably due to misfolding of the nascent hERG channel. There is evidence that folding and trafficking of even wild type channels is tenuous. hERG processing is affected by a wide variety of drugs and environmental stresses. Most investigation has logically focused on how amino acid changes affect channel protein processing. Less is known about mRNA-dependent factors in channel processing. Our preliminary studies analyzed the effects of non-coding (or more appropriately termed, extra-coding information) in hERG mRNA that does not alter amino acid sequence. We found that separate and independent regions of hERG mRNA contain information that greatly affects channel translation and trafficking efficiencies-an unusual occurrence. We postulate that a synergy occurs between the inherently fragile biosynthesis of hERG and the LQT2 missense mutations that contribute to the pathogenesis of hereditary LQT2. Investigation of mechanisms underlying mRNA-dependent processing of hERG channels may lead us to reconsider diagnostic and therapeutic approaches to hereditary and acquired arrhythmia syndromes. The aims of this project are: 1) To determine the specific locale and nature of mRNA elements that affect efficiency of hERG channel translation and trafficking. 2) To determine co- and post-translational mechanisms for mRNA-sequence- specific regulation of hERG channel protein translation and trafficking. 3) To investigate how hERG mRNA- sequence-specific elements impact the pathogenesis of LQT2."
"9606142","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Early intervention to identify and treat chronic disease and modify behavioral risk factors among women of reproductive age has the potential to significantly reduce their morbidity and mortality and improve their pregnancy outcomes. Lack of health insurance has been a major barrier to early intervention and preventive care among low-income women of reproductive age. However, the 2014 expansion of Medicaid under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) will make millions of low-income women newly eligible for Medicaid and preventive health services. An integrated data system is essential to evaluate the impact of this expansion on the health of women of reproductive age and their infants. Research using this data system will inform future program planning and identify best practices and areas of greatest need. We propose to create an integrated data system that links Oregon Medicaid data with birth and death certificates and hospital discharge data. Further, we will include data on the quality of Medicaid services that are not available to other states. The proposed study is a collaborative effort between Oregon State University and the Oregon Health Authority. Oregon is an ideal state in which to conduct the proposed study because of its ongoing commitment to Medicaid health care delivery reform and the commitment of state leaders to collaborate across divisions and programs to ensure this project's success. The project also has the support of key state stakeholders in maternal and child health and women's health. The specific aims of the proposal are to1) develop a research agenda, in collaboration with key stakeholders, to evaluate the expansion of Medicaid on the health of Medicaid-eligible women of reproductive age, mothers, and infants in Oregon; 2) link Oregon Medicaid data for female enrollees ages 15-44 and their infants to statewide datasets, including (but not limited to) live birth, fetal death, infant death, and hospital discharge data, beginning with 2008 and continuing until 2016, as data become available; and 3) conduct planned analyses and disseminate findings. The research agenda will include key research questions that assess the effect of Medicaid expansion on Medicaid enrollment and access to care for low-income women; utilization of services by women and infants enrolled in Medicaid; general health behaviors, risks, and outcomes for these women; and pregnancy complications and poor birth outcomes. We will also measure disparities that remain after Medicaid expansion, to inform strategies to mitigate those disparities on an ongoing basis. We will use results of these analyses to construct simulations that extend this study's findings into implications and lessons for policy makers and stakeholders in other states that are expanding Medicaid. Results of these analyses and simulations will provide valuable information to support health reform efforts, both in Oregon and across the U.S, to reduce the public health burden and improve population health among women of reproductive age, including pregnancy and infant health outcomes."
"9453611","ABSTRACT Mycoplasma genitalium (MG) is an important reproductive tract pathogen associated with nongonoccocal urethritis (NGU), cervicitis, endometritis, pelvic inflammatory disease, preterm birth, and tubal factor infertility, and notable for its extremely reduced genome. MG is more prevalent than Neisseria gonorrhoeae in many settings and is a risk factor for HIV acquisition. MG may persist for months to years in infected individuals, increasing the risk of transmission and the potential for serious reproductive tract sequelae. These findings highlight the urgency of understanding the molecular pathogenesis of this novel pathogen while the emergence of antibiotic resistance and threat of untreatable strains of MG underscore the need to devise alternative prevention and treatment regimens for this underappreciated and underfunded pathogen. Over the past decade our laboratory has focused on the variability and antigenicity of two key proteins required for MG pathogenesis, the adhesins MgpB and MgpC. This research has demonstrated that MgpB and its accessory protein, MgpC, undergo phase and antigenic variation via a unique system of homologous reciprocal recombination between the mgpBC expression site and partial copies archived in the chromosome. Although MgpBC antigenic variation may allow MG persistence and re-infection, paradoxically the non-variable C- terminus contains both the adhesin domain and the dominant epitopes targeted by antibody-mediated complement killing. It is imperative to understand how MG persists in the face of a pronounced antibody response that targets a highly conserved region of the immunodominant adhesin. To this end, the experiments proposed will characterize the interactions between bacteria and host cell receptors, in addition to more accurately defining and comparing the epitopes within the C-terminus responsible for attachment and/or antibody-directed complement killing. This proposal utilizes an innovative combination of experimental techniques including Surface Plasmon Resonance to investigate the thermodynamics and kinetics of MgpB- receptor and MgpB-antibody interactions in experimentally infected/immunized animals and persistently infected men in addition to those techniques that have been historically successful in Mycoplasma research including hemadsorption, hemagglutination, and complement-mediated killing. The identification of biologically active immunogenic epitopes and the localization of functional domain(s) within the conserved C-terminus of MgpB are key to understanding the pathogenesis of MG infection. The data generated by this application, along with approaches that pioneer new experimental protocols in the difficult field of Mycoplasmology, will lead to future studies developing novel MG treatment and prevention strategies, including vaccines, to combat this increasingly antibiotic-resistant and important STD pathogen."

"9387396","Project Summary/Abstract  The USC Norris Protocol Review and Monitoring System (PRMS) has two organizational components, the  Clinical Investigations Committee (CIC) and the Scientific Progress and Accrual Monitoring Subcommittee.  During the project period, PRMS has been significantly improved, resulting in reduced turnaround time and  fewer low accruing trials. Members of the CIC now represent a broad range of scientific disciplines and the  clear majority is senior investigators. To assure quality reviews, we have clarified member selection criteria and  term limit policies. We have also increased the frequency of CIC meetings and attendance rates, enhanced  scientific review and prioritization processes, improved written communications with PIs, and added maximum  PI response times to reduce delays. A new operational and financial review process has been added and  integrated into the PRMS workflow to assure operational feasibility without increasing turnaround. These and  other improvements have improved quality in the initial scientific review process and halved time to PRMS  approval, which averages four weeks. To enhance scientific monitoring of approved trials and to close trials  that are not achieving their enrollment targets more quickly, we formed a dedicated Scientific Progress and  Accrual Monitoring Subcommittee. The resulting structure completely separates scientific review and quality  assurance. With this organizational change, an existing accrual monitoring policy was tightened so that we can  close trials that are consuming institutional resources and are not enrolling at a reasonable pace. In summary,  the current PRMS process is highly effective in selecting and supporting investigator initiated trials and recent  changes having a very positive impact on both quality and efficiency. Additional improvements will be achieved  as OnCore is fully implemented and longer-term results are realized."
"9397569","Project Summary The ability to produce new myocytes within the heart would revolutionize our ability to treat cardiovascular disease, and new strategies for generating new cardiac muscle cells (cardiomyocytes) after injury, such as myocardial infarction (MI), are needed. Adult mammalian cardiomyocytes (CM) are generally considered to be post-mitotic, hence previous nongenetic strategies to stimulate resident CM proliferation have to date been insufficient to overcome CM loss with injury. However, recent reports demonstrate that adult differentiated CMs in humans and mice have the ability to proliferate, albeit at low frequency, suggesting that these rare events could be harnessed at a larger scale if the underlying mechanisms were fully understood. Developmental studies show that the transcription factor Tbx20 promotes CM proliferation in the fetal and neonatal heart. Tbx20 overexpression (Tbx20OE) in adult CMs induces fetal-like characteristics, including proliferation, smaller size, mononucleation, and fetal contractile protein expression. We hypothesize that induction of adult CM proliferation via a Tbx20-dependent pathway requires both partial dedifferentiation, mediated by increased BMP signaling, and repression of cell cycle inhibitors, including Btg2. The Aims are: 1) Determine if transient or exogenous Tbx20 expression is sufficient to promote adult CM proliferation and repair in vivo. 2) Determine if BMP signaling promotes CM dedifferentiation necessary for induction of adult CM proliferation in vivo. 3) Determine if loss of cell cycle inhibitors Btg1/2 promotes CM proliferation and repair after injury. The ability to induce resident adult mammalian CMs to proliferate by physiologic reversion to a fetal-like state would be an important advance in efforts to generate new myocardium after cardiac injury."
"9587430","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Despite the enrichment of VA suicide prevention services and implementation of the national suicide hotline, Veteran suicide completions have risen to 22 per day and suicide attempts numbered over 15,000 in 2012. These data underscore the urgency of developing additional interventions targeting suicidal Veterans. The construction of a Suicide Safety Plan (SSP); a best practice, is mandated throughout the VA system, and a vital component of the VA's coordinated effort at suicide prevention and recovery. Our pilot data on patterns of SSP use in suicidal Veterans over a 30 day time frame demonstrates that only 65% of Veterans used their safety plans, coping strategies listed on the plan were often mismatched or inadequate to the individual's needs, and limited access to the SSP during times of stress negatively impacted its utility. To our knowledge, there are currently no recommended guidelines or mechanisms for refinement of the SSP in adult populations beyond its initial development. Project Life Force (PLF), a novel suicide safety planning group intervention has been designed to fill this critical gap and provide a mechanism to develop and enhance suicide safety planning over time. PLF, a 12-session, group psychotherapy intervention, combines Dialectical Behavioral Therapy (DBT) skill based and psychoeducational approaches, to enhance suicide safety planning development and implementation. Veterans revise their plans over several weeks while learning distress tolerance, emotion regulation, and friendship building/interpersonal skills to incorporate  into their safety plans and also receive lessons on gun safety and minimizing access to lethal means. Sessions are augmented with 1) training in the use of a suicide safety planning mobile App to promote accessibility and maximize implementation, and 2) didactic information to bolster recovery, including fostering improved connection with the treatment team, and Veteran's family. Importantly, the group format mitigates loneliness and fosters increased belongingness, both key risk factors for suicide. Additionally, PLF's weekly format facilitates VA-mandated monitoring for any Veteran placed on the suicide high risk list.  Data from this project will test the intervention's feasibility, acceptability and preliminary efficacy and provid pilot data for a larger randomized clinical trial. The project is comprised of two phases. In Phase  1, we will finalize the PLF intervention and accompanying manual and handouts. In Phase 2, we will conduct an open label trial of PLF in 50 suicidal Veterans to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of the intervention. We will also test whether PLF affects outcomes of suicide ideation, depression, hopelessness, and outpatient compliance by examining clinically meaningful differences in these measures before and after PLF."
"9391195","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hypertension (HTN) is considered to be the single most important risk factor for adverse cardiovascular events, including stroke, myocardial infarction and death. It has been estimated that 70% of the 68 million American adults with HTN receive pharmacological treatment, but only 46% have their blood pressure (BP) adequately controlled. Patients with BP that remains above goal (systolic blood pressure >140 mm Hg and/or diastolic blood pressure >90 mm Hg) despite the concurrent use of 3 or more classes of antihypertensive medications, including a diuretic, are considered to have resistant hypertension (RH). With the growing prevalence of HTN in this country, RH is a major public health concern, affecting more than 7.5 million Americans. Patients with RH are at high risk for CVD-related events, and there is a need to develop effective management strategies to help lower BP and reduce risk in these individuals. Surprisingly, there have been no randomized clinical trials (RCTs) evaluating whether an adjunctive lifestyle intervention that combines exercise, weight loss, and optimal nutrition featuring the DASH diet may help control BP and reduce CVD risk in patients with RH. This proposed RCT is designed to evaluate whether RH patients can achieve clinically significant BP lowering and improve other biomarkers of CVD risk through a lifestyle intervention delivered in a center-based cardiac rehabilitation facility (C-LIF) compared to a standardized education and physician advice control condition (SEPA). One hundred fifty men and women with RH will be randomized in a 2:1 design to C-LIFE or SEPA. We hypothesize that C-LIFE participants will (1) exhibit greater improvements in aerobic fitness, greater adherence to the DASH diet, and greater weight loss after 4 months compared to SEPA controls; (2) exhibit lower clinic BP and ambulatory BP after 4 months compared to SEPA controls; (3) exhibit greater regression of LV hypertrophy and greater improvements in CVD risk biomarkers including arterial stiffness, baroreceptor reflex sensitivity, insulin resistance, and inflammatory markers after 4 months compared to SEPA controls; (4) exhibit lower clinic BP and ABP, and improved CVD biomarkers at 1 year follow-up compared to SEPA controls. We also hypothesize that greater aerobic fitness, better adherence to the DASH diet, and greater weight loss will be associated with greater reductions in clinic BP at 4 months and at 1 year follow-up. I successful, the lifestyle intervention described in this application could be adopted by cardiac rehabilitation programs nationwide, and provide a viable non-pharmacologic treatment for managing patients with RH."

"9391007","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Circadian rhythmicity is a fundamental aspect of human physiology. Disruption of circadian rhythm is a significant health burden, impacting sleep, cardiovascular, metabolic and psychiatric disorders. Understanding how circadian modulation of the body's physiology contributes to human health and disease requires a basic understanding of how circadian rhythms are generated and expressed. The overall goal of the proposed research is to identify the basic mechanisms of that encode circadian rhythmicity in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), the brain's clock. The SCN circuit undergoes synchronized daily oscillations in action potential (AP) firing, and circadian behavioral and physiological characteristics are established by this SCN circuit rhythm. Daily modulation of ion channel activity is a critical basis for generating the circadian rhythm in neuronal activity in the SCN. Oe such ion channel, the BK calcium- and voltage-activated potassium channel (Kcnma1) is a central regulator of circadian rhythm. Daily modulation of BK current magnitude drives SCN circuit rhythmicity, and loss of BK channel function disrupts circadian behavioral and physiological rhythms. The day-night difference in BK current level is mediated by the ?2 subunit, which causes inactivation of BK channels during the day. The circadian variation in BK current properties based on ?2 function is unique, but it is not clear how ?2 regulates AP activiy to shape the rhythms in SCN neuronal activity. The proposed studies test the hypothesis that ?2-mediated inactivation is the critical property required for the BK channel's dynamic role in SCN AP firing, and that this process is central to circadian behavior. This hypothesis will be investigated using electrophysiological recordings of BK currents and APs in acute SCN brain slices, providing data to correlate changes in AP waveforms with inactivating properties of the ?2 subunit. Furthermore, the consequences for inactivation of BK currents that stem from circadian changes in BK's calcium source will be investigated. Lastly, the impact of a human epilepsy-linked mutation and other single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that vary BK/?2 current properties will be tested and the relevance to SCN and behavioral rhythmicity will be determined. The outcome of this project will be an understanding of how the daily regulation of BK currents governs SCN excitability, providing new physiological and translational insight into the mechanisms that influence human BK channel activity."
"9386766","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Atrial stretch, caused by pressure and volume overload, contributes to development of atrial fibrosis, in patients with ventricular dysfunction such as mitral regurgitation or congestive heart failure. Atrial structural remodeling-including fibrosis- is a major component in development and progression of atrial fibrillation (AF). Prophylactic treatments which reduce stretch-mediated atrial remodeling exist, and would benefit patients, but the appropriate selection of patients is unclear, because atrial structural remodeling is difficult to assess clinically. This work introduces a new approach, which relies on several innovative ideas in cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR). We propose to increase the robustness and reliability of late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) using a sequential acquisition order, with acceptable fat-suppression, and a REPAIR pulse, designed to reduce artifacts in 1RR LGE acquisitions, in the presence of arrhythmias or RR variability. Further, we propose to quantify atrial collagen fraction, by suitably adapting T1 mapping methods to this high resolution application, with dark blood preparation. Extracellular volume fraction (ECV), based on T1 mapping, will be a more precise measure of the presence of collagen. Inflammation will be investigated using a fluid and fat-suppressed T2-mapping method. We will also evaluate 3D atrial strain. This atrial strain measurement would be extraordinarily challenging with conventional tagging methods, because of the thin walls of the atrium. However, we will develop 3D cine atrial imaging which can be processed, based on the expertise of our collaborators, with shape tracking to estimate atrial strain. We will then study these methods in an animal model of mitral regurgitation, and in patients with mitral disease. We will validate our in-vivo LGE and ECV measurements vs. histology in animals, and in the explanted hearts of heart-transplant recipients. Mitral regurgitation is a major risk factor for boh AF and atrial fibrosis development. We will test the major hypothesis that abnormal atrial stretch (low or high) -measured via strain measurements-generates inflammation and, at later time-points, atrial fibrosis. The project carries a health benefit to a broad spectrum of patients, by potentially permitting early treatment with anti-fibrotic medications or interventions in appropriae patients at risk for atrial-fibrosis related AF."

"9392184","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Heart failure (HF), the final manifestation of most cardiovascular pathologies, is a devastating disease with poor prognosis. Pathologic cardiac remodeling (hypertrophy, fibrosis) is a known predictor of clinical outcome. We and others have demonstrated that pathologic activation of the cardiac fibroblast (CF) (support cell) after cardiac injury releases various pro-hypertrophic/inflammatory mediators that target both cardiomyocytes (CM) (functional cell) and fibroblasts to exacerbate remodeling. Elucidating mechanisms of this pathologic communication may hold therapeutic promise. Mixed Lineage Kinases (MLKs) are a family of stress-activated dual-specificity MAPKKKs upstream of JNK and p38 MAPKs. MLK3 in particular has been directly implicated in HIV-associated neurodegeneration (HAND), where it mediates microglial (support cell) activation neuronal (functional cell) damage. The similar pathogenic mechanisms of HAND and HF, namely deleterious support cell-functional cell communication, suggest a similar pathologic role for MLK3 in HF. However, the functional role(s) of MLKs in the heart remain largely unknown. We have generated global MLK3-/- and CF-targeted conditional MLK3fl/fl mice, in which we have found no basal cardiac phenotype; however, they are protected following myocardial injury. We have synthesized MLK3-specific inhibitory compounds, including URMC-099 (CNS-penetrant) and URMC-128 (CNS-impenetrant). URMC-099 reduced pathologic CF activation in vitro; it significantly attenuated cardiac hypertrophy and reduced interstitial fibrosis in pharmacologic and surgical models of HF, with no additive benefit in MLK3 global or conditional null mice. Our hypothesis is that MLK3 plays an important role in pathologic CF activation and HF progression and that its inhibition holds therapeutic promise for HF. To address our hypothesis, we propose the following Aims: Aim 1: Determine the therapeutic efficacy and specificity of MLK3 inhibition or ablation in clinically-relevant HF models in wild type, MLK3-/- and inducible CM or CF MLK3-/- mice. This aim will investigate the therapeutic efficacy and specificity of MLK3 pharmacologic inhibition (using our structurally distinct CNS-penetrant or -impenetrant compounds) and/or ablation (global, inducible CM, inducible resident or activated CF-restricted null mice) in ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) HF. Aim 2: Elucidate the cellular mechanisms underlying MLK3 inhibition and provide validation of MLK3 as a therapeutic target in both mouse and human HF. This aim will test the hypothesis that MLK3 inhibition or ablation will attenuate pathologic CF activation and subsequent CF/MF-CM pathologic crosstalk, using primary rodent CF and CM (Aim 1) subjected to pathogenic insults. Importantly, similar assays will ensue in human HF cardiac cells. MLK3 gain of function studies in vitro and in vivo will complement these studies. Our results may elucidate a new approach for treating HF and a novel paradigm of pathologic support cell-functional cell cross talk in the pathophysiology of multiple disease states."
"9392581","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Acute respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation is an enormous clinical and financial burden on the health system, affecting over 750,000 patients in the United States each year. These patients experience substantial morbidity and mortality, particularly in small hospitals with low annual caseloads. To improve outcomes for these patients, many experts propose a regionalized approach to mechanical ventilation, analogous to the United States trauma system. Under regionalization, mechanically ventilated patients admitted to small, resource-poor hospitals would be systematically triaged to large regional referral hospitals. Regionalization has potential to save lives and increase access to high-quality critical care for patients requiring mechanical ventilation. Yet, implementation efforts face significant barriers, most notably the lack of empirical data demonstrating that centralizing care in regional hospitals of excellence actually improves outcomes. Although many studies demonstrate that mechanical ventilation outcomes are better at high-volume hospitals compared to low-volume hospitals, these studies fail to fully uncover the implications of regionalized care, which involves not only increasing case volume at some hospitals but also decreasing it at others. Prior to moving forward, clinicians and policy makers require empirical data on the implications of regionalized critical care in real-world settings. The overall goal of this project is to empirically evaluate the outcome benefit of regionalized critical care for patiets with acute respiratory failure. In Aim 1 we will define novel critical care referral regions as a geographic foundation for quantifying regional care delivery. In Aim 2 we will identify regional factors associated with greater centralization of care for acute respiratory failure. In Aim 3 we will determine the association between centralized critical care and outcomes for patients with acute respiratory failure. Completion of these Aims will both advance our knowledge of the relationship between regionalization and outcomes for acute respiratory failure, as well as provide a scientific foundation for future efforts to centralize care for other high-risk patients.The research plan will be augmented by intensive mentoring by experts in the field and didactic research training at the University of Pittsburgh and Carnegie Mellon University. Together, the research project, mentoring and coursework described herein will provide the primary investigator with essential career development in the areas of: (1) spatial epidemiology and health care geographical information systems analysis, (2) advanced hierarchical statistical modeling and (3) organizational science and health care market analysis. Ultimately, this work will set the stage for research evaluating centralized care of other time-sensitive conditions in a comprehensive R01-funded project and uniquely position the primary investigator as a future leader in the use of geographic modeling to improve outcomes for critically ill patients."

"9397542","TMD (Temporomandibular joint disorders) affect 5-10% of the population in this country, with severe TMD requiring surgical repair. The cause for TMD is often hard to determine, and the pathophysiology underlying this affliction remains unclear, as the mandibular condylar cartilage (MCC) differs considerably in its development and structure from both a growth plate or an articular cartilage. However, the regulation of TMJ development and growth has been under-studied. Chondrogenesis in the TMJ or limbs has been considered a linked but separate process from osteogenesis during endochondral bone formation. How can the inherited message be transmitted from chondrocytes, which supposedly undergo cell death before bone formation, to the cells that form bone? The answer to this question may lie in recent studies indicating that a direct transformation of chondrocytes to osteoblasts occurs. Yet, the following key questions remain: how is this cell transformation linked to bone growth and remodeling? What is the underlying molecular mechanism? Which genes are required for cell transformation? We propose that chondrogenesis and osteogenesis are one continuous process in which chondrocyte-derived bone cells (CBC) define the overall pattern of MCC-ramus and contribute to bone remodeling via Bmpr1a (BMP receptor 1a, a key receptor for BMP2 and BMP4) and ?-catenin. This hypothesis is based on: 1) Published data from our lab and others demonstrating that direct cell transformation occurs in MCC and limbs; 2) Deleting Bmpr1a or ?-catenin in chondrocytes leads to drastic changes in the condyle and limbs during growth and bone remodeling, though deletion of either gene in bone cells has little impact on the skeletal pattern; and 3) The molecular regulation of cell transformation is highly dependent on the skeletal elements, developmental stage, and different genes. We will test this hypothesis using the following highly related but independent Aims: 1) To determine molecular regulation of cell transformation by Bmpr1a during growth and bone remodeling. Working hypothesis: the CBC defines the overall morphology of the condyle and limbs via BMPR1A that plays variant roles in different elements of the skeleton; and 2): To determine molecular regulation of cell transformation by ?-catenin during growth and bone remodeling. Working hypothesis: ?-catenin plays variant roles in the condyle vs. limbs in defining skeletal pattern and bone remodeling in a manner that differs from Bmpr1a; and 3): To determine how chondrocytes demineralize cartilage matrices and form bone cells ex vivo, and shift expression profiles of genes directly linked to bone cells in vitro. Working hypothesis: HCs, which migrate, play a dual role in removing calcified cartilage and cell transformation. We expect that CBC is responsible for most endochondral bone formation and remodeling, regulated by Bmpr1a and ?-catenin. We predict that this phenomenon also occurs in limbs, although differentially regulated by these genes. Finishing this project will likely revise the current dogma, provide new knowledge in this understudied area, and form a basis for developing novel approaches to prevent, diagnose, and treat TMD, as well as other skeletal diseases."
"9385708","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Atherosclerosis and associated cardiovascular disease (CVD) are the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the US. Atherosclerosis is characterized by the accumulation of lipids in the artery wall, and is an inflammatory disease in which several immune effectors including macrophages play a central role. Obesity, insulin resistance, diabetes, and dyslipidemia are all major risk factors for CVD, but the mechanisms that link disordered metabolism to inflammation and the development of atherosclerosis remain to be elucidated. Our published work and preliminary data demonstrate that the double stranded RNA activated protein kinase, PKR, is activated in the context of obesity, where it plays a critica role in driving inflammation and the deterioration of glucose homeostasis. In macrophages, exposure to lipotoxic signals and lipoproteins activate PKR. In addition, PKR is a critical component for the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, and stress signaling pathways such as JNK, which are implicated in the pathogenesis of both diabetes and atherosclerosis. In addition, in supporting data presented in this proposal we demonstrate a significant protection against atherosclerotic plaque development in PKR-deficient mice. Based on these findings our overarching hypothesis is that by modulating inflammatory activity, insulin action, and protein synthesis, PKR links cellular stress and metabolic signals to chronic inflammation and atherosclerosis. The experiments described in this proposal will test that hypothesis by determining the role of PKR in the activation and function of macrophages, and by assessing the whole body and macrophage-specific requirement for PKR in the development of atherosclerosis in vivo. This contribution will expand our understanding of the link between nutrient stress and the development of cardiometabolic disease. The innovation of this work lies in investigating a novel approach to atherosclerosis therapy by identifying the mechanistic link between dyslipidemia and inflammatory activation of immune cells."
"9311515","Project Summary The brain has the remarkable capability to change in response to experience. This plasticity is essential for learning and memory, and is an important feature of the auditory cortex, especially for learning the significance of sensory signals such as speech, for the use of devices such as cochlear implants, and for recovery after short- term deafness. These changes are thought to occur primarily at synapses, basic units of information processing and plasticity. Long-term synaptic plasticity requires sensory experience and activation of neuromodulatory systems which convey behavioral context to local cortical circuits. However, little is known about the interactions between synaptic inputs and release of neuromodulators in vivo, making it challenging to relate perceptual learning to plasticity in the auditory cortex or other brain areas. Recently we developed an approach to measuring dynamics of synaptic modifications for hours, coupled with imaging techniques enabling us to monitor the same cells over days during training, directly monitoring and manipulating activity in behaving mice. These approaches allow for a close examination of links between modulation, cortical plasticity and auditory perceptual learning.  Specifically, we will study how auditory perceptual training activates the cholinergic vs noradrenergic modulatory systems. These two modulators are principally involved in selective attention towards behaviorally- important stimuli, general arousal, and learning. However, there may be important functional differences in these systems in terms of when they are active during different phases of training or consequences of cholinergic and noradrenergic modulation on auditory neurons for contextual information processing. This proposal describes a series of imaging, recording, optogenetic, and behavioral experiments that will compare and contrast the effects of locus coeruleus activation and norepinephrine release vs the effects of nucleus basalis activation and cholinergic modulation on the primary auditory cortex of behaving mice. Many studies have highlighted the importance of recording in awake animals during behavior, and we will first examine how ensembles of excitatory and inhibitory neurons are affected by learning over the entire duration of training, as animals go from nave and poor performers, to having reliable performance on an auditory detection and recognition task we have used in the lab for years. Next, we determine when and how cholinergic and noradrenergic modulation affect behavioral and neural responses. Finally, we will make some of the first direct measurements of modulatory neuron responses, asking how these systems are activated by task-relevant variables such as sounds linked to reward.  In summary, here we use in vivo recording and imaging methods to ask how behavioral training engages and modifies noradrenergic and cholinergic systems, to collectively affect auditory cortical processing and persistently improve auditory perceptual abilities in behaving mice."
"9402648","SUMMARY Neovessel guidance in angiogenesis Vascular connectivity between adjacent vessel beds within and between tissue compartments is an essential aspect of any successful neovascularization process. To establish new connections, growing neovessels must locate other vascular elements during angiogenesis, often crossing matrix and other tissue-associated boundaries and interfaces. This is perhaps best highlighted in situations of tissue grafting (e.g. tissue free flaps) during which the vasculature of the graft must cross the graft-host tissue interface before connecting to the surrounding host circulation in order for the graft to survive. An inability for a tissue graft vasculature to connect to the host vasculature is the primary cause for tissue graft failure and necrosis. How growing neovessels traverse any tissue interface, whether part of the native tissue structure or secondary to a grafting procedure, is not known. In a series of preliminary experiments, we have determined that actively growing neovessels are unable to spontaneously cross a stroma-stroma interface during angiogenesis. Our published findings that tissue stromal biomechanics, specifically the biophysical aspects of the matrix, has a profound influence on the direction and branching of growing neovessels suggests that this interface is biomechanically incompatible with interface invasion. In addition, we have evidence that a sub-population of tissue-resident, stromal macrophages facilitates neovessel invasion of the stromal interface during angiogenesis through a VEGF-A-dependent process. Importantly, it appears that stromal cells need to migrate across the interface in order to promote interface invasion by the neovessels, suggesting that spatial gradients of VEGF-A are required. Based on these observations, we hypothesize that the graded angiogenic factor signals overcome the biomechanical barriers to directed angiogenesis caused by a stroma-stroma interface to promote interface neovascular invasion. The project will involve a combination of in vitro and computational models of angiogenesis across tissue-tissue boundaries to test this hypothesis and determine the mechanism by which stromal cells use VEGF-A signaling to regulate neovessel behavior in coordination with stroma biomechanical dynamics. These studies will provide new insights into a poorly understood aspect of vascular biology and tissue-vascular dynamics as well as create opportunities for therapeutic strategies to facilitate tissue healing, improving angiogenesis-based treatments, and tissue grafting/transplantation."
"9387402","Project Summary/Abstract  The overall goal of the Gastrointestinal Cancers (GI) Program is to rapidly translate basic, population, and  clinical research findings into more effective prevention and treatment strategies for patients with GI cancers.  We have built a successful translational team through the close collaboration of GI clinical investigators with  basic and population scientists. The Program is based on Team Science and, as a result, 27 members from  nine academic departments in two schools are organized around the causes, prevention, and treatment of GI  cancers, effectively facilitating bed to bench and bench to bedside research. Our clinician investigators are  members of NCI task forces and PIs of national clinical trials in gastric, colon, and biliary cancer. Program  members have $11M in peer-reviewed funding (direct costs), of which 45% is from NCI, 36% is from NIH, and  3% from other peer-reviewed funding sources. They interact regularly via a series of weekly and monthly  seminars/meetings that facilitate exchange of recent research findings and interdisciplinary collaborations  between Program investigators. These structured forums have fostered a large number of collaborative  projects across the basic, population science, and clinical spectrum. During the last five years, the Program  has generated 626 GI cancer related publications, of which 31% were inter-programmatic, 18% were intra-  programmatic, and 50% inter-institutional. Heinz-Josef Lenz and Michael Kahn are Co-Leaders of the  Program. Dr. Lenz is a physician-scientist internationally known for his work on pharmacogenomics and drug  development in GI cancers. Dr. Kahn is a basic scientist and expert on signal transduction pathways and drug  development. He is internationally known for his work in Wnt signaling, which has led to the development of the  novel Wnt signaling modulator PRI-724, developed by Prism Pharma. PRI-724 completed a Phase Ia human  clinical trial in 2012 and is currently in multiple Phase III trials. Other Program investigators have played pivotal  roles in advancing the knowledge base in GI carcinogenesis and treatment outcomes. They include: 1)  Stephen Gruber, an authority in colon cancer genetics and PI of the GWAS efforts in colon cancer; 2) Anthony  El-Khoueiry and Syma Iqbal, who lead biomarker-driven clinical trials and early drug development in GI cancer;  and 3) James Ou and Keigo Machida, who have made significant progress in understanding the role of HBV  and HCV liver cancer and of tumor initiating cells in hepatocellular carcinoma. One of the strengths and  signatures of the Program is that it has developed an infrastructure and a community of national and  international collaborators that allow rapid transition of new findings from the bench into the clinic. The  Program's scientific priorities, grant strategies, and clinical protocols are driven by the specific needs of our Los  Angeles catchment area, focusing specifically on colorectal, cholangio, and gastric cancer in Hispanics, and  hepatocellular carcinoma in Asians."
"9431554","PROJECT SUMMARY The goal of this proposal is to describe a 5-year plan to prepare Ashley Steed, MD, PhD, for independence as a physician-scientist studying the role of the microbiome in antiviral immunity. She graduated with distinction from Duke University with a degree in Biology and obtained her medical and research graduate degree from Washington University School of Medicine's Medical Scientist Training Program. After completing her residency and during her pediatric critical care fellowship, she joined Dr. Thaddeus Stappenbeck's laboratory, where she has demonstrated that elevated basal interferon type I signaling is protective to the host during influenza infection. This finding resolves a controversy in the influenza field. She has extended these studies to investigate the role of the enteric microbiome in driving systemic interferon levels and the consequences for viral infection. These findings serve as the basis for the aims in this proposal. Washington University School of Medicine is an exemplary location for Dr. Steed to develop her research platform with its longstanding history of NIH funded research and breadth and depth of resources. There is frequent crosstalk among departments, as Dr. Steed's mentoring committee and collaborators demonstrate, combining the expertise from the departments of Microbiology, Immunology, Pediatrics, and Medicine. Dr. Stappenbeck is a leader in the field of host-microbial interactions at mucosal surfaces; thus he is an ideal mentor for Dr. Steed because of his ability to decipher mechanisms of pathogenesis and his strong track record in training young scientists. His laboratory is a training hub of intellectual energy with a diverse group working on broad and creative projects. Dr. Steed will have multiple opportunities to present her work locally and in the larger scientific community. She will take graduate level classes to enhance her knowledge in microbiology and genomics and develop key technical skills with her collaborators. Dr. Steed's immediate goal is to fulfill the aims outlined in this proposal. While it is clear that the enteric microbiome is important for resistance to influenza pathogenesis, molecular understanding of this interaction remains obscure. She recently discovered a microbially-associated metabolite, desaminotyrosine, that enhances type I interferon signaling. This finding suggests that a specific microbial metabolite may mediate the protective effect of the microbiome. By completing the proposed aims, Dr. Steed will 1) test the hypothesis that desaminotyrosine protects from influenza pathogenesis by enhancing systemic interferon signaling, 2) define the mechanism by which desaminotyrosine augments interferon signaling, and 3) identify components of the microbiome that produce desaminotyrosine. Her laboratory's initial focus will be to further delineate these mechanisms such that insight from her research will translate to strategies aimed at improving resistance to viral pathogenesis and enhancing antiviral immunity."
"9394032","Summary  Endothelial cells play a critical role in multiple aspects of lung development and homeostasis, yet the precise mechanisms that regulate vasculogenesis and how endothelial cells signal to other cell types to orchestrate lung development have not been well defined. Accurate regulation of these processes is critical to ensure proper lung development and prevent bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), a lung disease of premature infants that often results in life-long complications. Hallmarks of BPD are impaired vasculature and arrested lung development. We created three-dimensional (3D) co-culture systems in which lung endothelial cells (LuMECs) drive the putative lung stem cells, BASCs, to produce bronchiolar or alveolar organoids. These organoid cultures provide an opportunity to model interactions that occur between endothelial cells and alveolar cells during lung development. Using this system, we discovered a novel BMP4-NFATc1- Thrombospondin (TSP1) pathway in endothelial and epithelial cells in the adult lung. We showed that TSP1, known as an anti-angiogenic factor, is required for the development of alveolar organoids. We also identified R-spondin2 (Rspo2), which regulates Wnt signaling in other systems, as a BMP4-regulated protein that may be downstream of TSP1 in endothelial cells. The mechanisms underlying TSP1 regulation of lung vascular development and alveolarization are unknown. We hypothesize that endothelial-derived TSP1 induced by BMP4-NFATc1 signaling inhibits pulmonary vascular development and is required for proper lung development. Further, we posit that vascular lung injury, such as that seen with hyperoxia exposure, impairs TSP1 signaling, thereby altering vasculogensis and blocking alveolar development. In Aim 1, we will determine how TSP1- CD47 interactions regulate vasculogenesis and lung development. Defective lung endothelial cells from mice exposed to hyperoxia will be used in lung organoid co-cultures to test the impact of impaired endothelial cell signals on alveolarization. Similarly, cells from knockout mice will be used in neonatal lung organoid cultures to determine the effect of CD47 deficiency on alveolar development. CD47-knockout mice and endothelial- specific TSP1-knockout mice will be used to test the role of TSP1-CD47 interactions in the response to neonatal hyperoxia-mediated lung vascular injury in vivo. In Aim 2, we will define the mechanisms by which TSP1-dependent Rspo2 mediates pulmonary vascular development by evaluating ligand response in vitro and after neonatal hyperoxic injury in vivo. Recombinant Rspo2 will be used in neonatal lung organoid cultures and in assays for endothelial cell proliferation, migration and tube formation. We will determine if lung endothelial cell secreted factors, and more specifically, Rspo2, is sufficient for prevention of neonatal hyperoxia-mediated lung injury. These studies will elucidate mechanisms by which lung endothelial cells drive critical outcomes in development. This work will determine if defective TSP1-dependent signaling is a mechanism of interrupted lung development in premature infants with BPD, leading to new ways to direct therapy for BPD."
"9441102","Although mechanical ventilation (MV) is a life-saving intervention in patients suffering from respiratory failure, prolonged MV is often associated with numerous complications including problematic weaning which increases patient morbidity and mortality. Prolonged MV results in a severely diminished blood flow and O2 delivery to the diaphragm at rest and during contractions, which limits O2 uptake and cripples contractile function. The latter would force reliance on anaerobic metabolism and lead to premature diaphragm fatigue and weaning failure. The mechanisms for the progressive reduction in diaphragm blood flow and the impaired hyperemic response during contractions with MV are unknown, but likely result from impaired microcirculatory function. To date, there are no studies investigating how prolonged MV affects respiratory muscle microcirculatory function in healthy individuals, let alone in aging or in patients with underlying pathologies. Our central hypothesis is that mechanical ventilation results in vascular dysfunction within the diaphragm and compromises the ability to augment O2 delivery and support contractile function to the diaphragm during weaning. Two integrated yet independent specific aims are proposed to test this central hypothesis. In Specific Aim 1, we will determine whether prolonged MV a) alters a vascular mechanical force in the diaphragm, which affects both endothelium responses and mechanical alterations (i.e., shear-stress), and b) impairs endothelial and/or smooth muscle function of the diaphragm resistance vasculature with MV and whether this is related to diminished NO signaling or oxidant production. For Specific Aim #2, we will employ two interventions designed specifically to target the unique environment of the diaphragm with MV and determine, in vivo, whether such interventions can preserve the blood flow and force generating capacity of the diaphragm after prolonged MV to facilitate weaning. We will use a combination of in vivo and in vitro approaches in these studies that will allow students to engage in semester long to multi-year projects in the laboratory. We predict that several of these projects will also provide the foundation for graduate and post-graduate studies of the students involved. This proposal is novel because it challenges the widespread assumption that diaphragm O2 delivery during MV is sufficient, and weaning difficulties are not due to vascular dysfunction. Information derived from this project could be rapidly translated to MV operational care to reduce the morbidity, mortality and health-care burden associated with MV and weaning difficulties."
"9395932","Project Summary/Abstract The applicants' long-term aim is to gain insights into mechanisms and therapies of heart failure (HF). In this study, we will examine the way that cellular architecture and calcium (Ca) handling proteins involved in excitation-contraction coupling are modified in human HF. Further studies will be performed on patients that undergo implantation of left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) to establish (1) a microstructural basis for functional remodeling in HF cells, and (2) if microstructure of HF cells can predict long-term sustainability of cardiac recovery by LVAD unloading. Our studies are motivated by the finding that nearly 20% of our patients respond to unloading with cardiac recovery and that recovery in patients required integrity of the transverse tubular system (t-system) before unloading. In Specific Aim 1, three-dimensional reconstructions of the t- system and associated ryanodine receptor (RyR) clusters will be obtained with scanning confocal microscopy. We will investigate ventricular tissues from normal donor hearts and hearts from patients in end stage HF. The studies are based on the hypothesis that structures in control myocytes are altered in HF cells. We found that human cells exhibit a very different phenotype in HF than previously described in animal models. In particular, we found that the t-system remodels to axial, sheet-like invaginations of the sarcolemma in HF. We will then establish the extent to which RyR clusters are not associated with sarcolemma (primarily t-system) for control and HF cells. Findings in intact tissue will be compared with isolated cells. In Specific Aim 2, we will study the changes in Ca transients that produce contractions as a consequence of alterations in the t-system and proteins associated with EC coupling. This includes measuring Ca movements in normal and HF cells with rapid two-dimensional confocal microscopy. We will test the hypothesis that Ca transients in HF are disorganized compared to control. We will measure L-type Ca currents and calculate the gain of EC coupling. We expect that remodeling of the t-system leads to decreased gain in HF cells. Also, we will measure Ca extrusion from the cell and Ca uptake into the sarcoplasmic reticulum, and relate those to t-system remodeling. In Specific Aim 3, we will test the hypothesis that alterations that we observe at the time of LVAD implantation predict cardiac recovery. Integrity of t-system and improvement of functional properties induced by LVAD unloading are expected to underlie cardiac recovery. We will investigate whether LVAD unloading can reverse effects of HF on protein densities, t-system, Ca release, gain of EC coupling and decline of Ca transients. Finally, we will test the hypothesis that microstructural alterations observed at time of LVAD implantation predict long-term sustainability of recovery in patients undergoing LVAD explantation. Together, the proposed studies constitute a crucial step towards understanding effects of human HF and LVAD unloading at the cellular level. Clinical applications of our results and conclusions include the identification of patients that are likely to be sustained responders based on cardiac biopsies that are acquired at time of LVAD implantation."
"9438536","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Intraocular pressure (IOP) and age were found to be the most consistent independent risk factors for development and progression of glaucoma in all of the major prospective clinical trials, even though IOP has not been shown to increase with age in most populations. Glaucoma is also much more prevalent in persons of African ancestry. Lowering IOP is the only clinical treatment that has been shown to retard the onset and progression of glaucoma, but once damaged, the optic nerve head (ONH) is thought to be more susceptible to further glaucomatous progression even after clinical intervention has lowered mean IOP to `normal' levels. We have previously interpreted these findings to mean that the ONH is increasingly vulnerable to glaucomatous injury with advancing age, African ancestry, and prior damage. There is a plausible alternative explanation, however. Our telemetric IOP data show that the eye is subjected to about 7,000 IOP spikes >5 mmHg per hour during waking hours. Also, IOP spikes >1 mmHg above baseline are responsible for up to 15% of the total IOP insult the eye must absorb during waking hours on average. This is an extraordinary finding, in that IOP spikes represent a previously unknown and potentially highly injurious component of the IOP total insult that has yet to be characterized or considered in previous animal or clinical studies.  We hypothesize that greater IOP and ocular perfusion pressure (OPP) fluctuation independently contribute to the onset and progression of glaucoma in addition to mean IOP. We will test this organizing hypothesis by elucidating the age- and disease-related changes in IOP, OPP, and their fluctuations as they relate to retinal ganglion cell (RGC) axon loss and elevated IOP-induced ocular coat stiffening.  Support for the fluctuation hypothesis would lead to an entirely new understanding of the importance of IOP and OPP fluctuation in the increased age- and disease-related susceptibility to glaucoma and provide strong rationale for totally new clinical diagnosis and treatment modalities that employ IOP and OPP fluctuation reduction through modification of ocular coats stiffness or intraocular damping of IOP fluctuations. If our results do not support the fluctuation hypothesis, the knowledge we gain about the natural fluctuations of these variables will redefine the appropriate IOP measurement frequency in patients and inform patient care."
"9397563","Project Summary: Obesity increases the incidence and severity of asthma, but an incomplete understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying obesity-related asthma make it difficult prevent and treat this phenotype. Parasympathetic nerves mediate one mechanism of airway hyperreactivity. These nerves provide dominant autonomic control of airway tone and release acetylcholine (ACh), which activates M3 muscarinic receptors on airway smooth muscle, causing contraction and bronchoconstriction. ACh release is controlled by inhibitory M2 muscarinic receptors on these nerves. Thus, airway hyperreactivity results from decreased neuronal M2 receptor function and subsequent increased ACh release. Our preliminary data show that obesity is associated with increased bronchoconstriction in response to parasympathetic nerve stimulation, with reduced neuronal M2 receptor function, and that these effects are mediated by insulin even in the absence of inflammation. Thus, our hypothesis is that increased insulin, as seen in obesity, binds to insulin receptors on airway parasympathetic nerves resulting in airway hyperreactivity by reducing M2 muscarinic function on parasympathetic nerves (thus increasing ACh release). We propose to test how insulin reduces M2 receptor expression and function, identify which insulin receptor and signaling pathways mediate neuronal M2 dysfunction and test whether manipulating insulin (with diet, oral anti-glycemic drugs and with an insulin binding antibody) protects M2 receptor function and inhibits obesity induced airway hyperreactivity. This research is significant because it has the potential to explain why obese patients with increased insulin, are more prone to asthma and identify novel strategies, including control of insulin, and M3 selective muscarinic antagonists, that may treat obesity-related asthma."
"9390833","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal describes the five-year mentored training program devised to facilitate the career development of Olujimi A. Ajijola MD PhD, into an independent physician scientist, capable of high-level scientific investigation. The important role of the intrinsic cardiac nervous system (ICNS) in the beat-to-beat regulation of cardiac contractile and electrophysiologic function is increasingly recognized, yet, it remains poorly understood. In the long term, the candidate seeks to develop a scientific and clinical niche in the field of intrinsic- neurocardiology, initially in the basic aspects, and in the future, bedside application of fundamental findings from studying ICNS physiology in normal and diseased states. The end objective of this career track is to develop therapeutic strategies modulating the ICNS (and higher cardiac neuro-regulatory centers) for patient care. The short- to intermediate-term goals of the candidate are to develop an expertise in neuroscience, and to expand his skill sets to include neuroscientific research methods and techniques, building on his expertise in cardiac structural biology and electrophysiology, and foundations in neuroscience. The career development plan for Dr. Ajijola have the following key elements: 1) mentorship by two well-recognized and invested experts in the fields of neuroscience (including ICNS physiology) and cardiac electrophysiology; 2) didactic and hands on training in developing an expanded knowledge base, scientific research tools, and techniques in neuroscience; 3) continued expansion of cardiac electrophysiologic expertise; and 4) a pathway for tracking the candidate's overall development, and the gradual assumption of independence, expected to be fully realized by the conclusion of the grant period. The proposed track has already been initiated, with preliminary data reinforcing the scientific aims of the proposal. The research objectives of the present proposal are to identify the mechanisms by which a clinically successful neuromodulatory therapy, bilateral cardiac sympathetic decentralization (BCSD), imparts antiarrhythmic benefits. Imbalances in neuro-hormonal activation resulting from neuronal remodeling within the cardiac neural-axis occur following significant cardiac injury. These imbalances lead to excessive and destabilizing efferent cardiac sympathetic neurotransmission. BCSD, the resection of the lower pole of the stellate ganglion and the sympathetic ganglia at the 2nd through 4th thoracic levels, likely eliminates these efferent cardiac sympathetic inputs from reaching the heart, however, the mechanistic translation of this effect to cardiac neuro- regulation, especially in infarcted myocardium, is unknown. We hypothesize that the intrinsic cardiac nervous system (ICNS), as the final integrator of cardiac afferent and efferent neurotransmission, is the end-target for BCSD. Specifically, BCSD mitigates the abnormal integration and processing of neurotransmission, to and from the heart, and remodeling of structural and functional elements within the ICNS, induced by enhanced sympathetic inputs originating from higher neural centers. By so doing, BCSD, via the ICNS, attenuates cardiac action potential duration heterogeneity, and enhanced myocyte automaticity, two known mechanisms of arrhythmogenesis under states of enhanced sympathetic tone. We plan to exploit this clinically beneficial antiarrhythmic therapy to understand how cardiac information is processed within the ICNS, and the cardiac electrophysiologic consequences of stochastic ICNS signaling patterns before and after BCSD. Combining high resolution cardiac electrophysiologic mapping with in vivo recordings of neuronal signals within the ICNS, this proposal will identify novel interactions within the cardiac nervous system and their electrophysiologic consequences. In specific aim 1a, we will determine how information is processed within the ICNS in normal and infarcted hearts, before and after BCSD performed immediately after infarction, or delayed till remodeling changes have set in. In aim 1b, we will examine how ICNS structural and neurochemical (i.e. neuropeptide) properties are altered by infarction, and impact of stabilizing efferent input by BCSD. In aim 2, we will assess how post-infarct ICNS signaling impacts cardiac electrophysiological properties by performing high resolution focal and global electrophysiologic mapping in infarcted hearts with an without BCSD; and further the differences between immediate post-infraction BCSD, and delayed BCSD. Cardiac and neuronal electrophysiologic mapping of this nature has not been previously performed. Impactful findings derived from these animal studies will form the basis for future bench to bedside studies aimed at developing novel or improving current neuromodulation therapies for treating ventricular arrhythmias."
"9392161","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The increased prevalence of obesity among the children of military personnel has paralleled that observed in the civilian population. Disordered eating, especially binge or loss of control (LOC) eating, is common among adolescents and is a salient risk factor for obesity and the development of exacerbated disordered eating and depressive symptoms. The goal of this proposal is to test the effectiveness of interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT) to slow the trajectory of weight gain in adolescent boys and girls at high-risk for adult obesity by virtue of elevated body mass index (BMI) percentile and LOC eating. IPT targets the difficult social functioning and stressful events that are associated with LOC and highly relevant to the adolescent youth from military families. Male and female adolescent military dependents will be randomized to receive either the IPT weight gain prevention program or a health education (HE) control condition, for 12 weekly group sessions. Adolescents' weight status, eating behaviors, and mood will be assessed at baseline, immediately following the prevention program (12-weeks), and at 1-year follow-up. At 2-year and 3-year follow-up time points, participants' BMI and physiologic data will be collected via the Military Health System's electronic medical record system. It is hypothesized that adolescents who receive the IPT group program will show significantly less weight gain (or more weight loss) relative to those randomized to HE at 3-year follow-up. Additionally, it is hypothesized that adolescents receiving IPT (as compared to HE) will demonstrate improvements on secondary outcomes of interest, including the presence and frequency of classic binge eating episodes, as well as obesity-related physiological measures of health (e.g., fasting insulin). The overall goal of the proposal is to prevent excess weight gain and adult obesity, and to prevent worsening disordered eating and metabolic functioning among overweight military dependents at risk for adult obesity and binge eating disorders."
"9420706","PROJECT SUMMARY Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) is a significant cause of chronic kidney disease, has few effective treatment options, and usually progresses to end-stage renal disease (ESRD). FSGS has a substantive genetic component. Study of gene mutations that cause FSGS has provided invaluable insight into normal glomerular function and the disease pathogenesis of FSGS. Mutations in TRPC6 are a known cause of FSGS. In addition, TRPC6 levels are often increased in more common forms of kidney disease, implying that TRPC6 activity may impact both acquired and genetic forms of FSGS. TRPC6 is an ion channel found on the surface of cells, making it an attractive pharmacologic target. However, two key questions about TRPC6 and the development of FSGS remain unanswered. Is it simply that excess TRPC6 activity is detrimental to glomerular function, or is TRPC6 like Goldilocks, with either too much or too little detrimental? Which of the multiple signaling pathways intersecting with TRPC6 are relevant to the development of glomerular pathology? We have created novel animal models - mice with the equivalent of a human FSGS mutation in Trpc6 and others with a dominant negative (DN) Trpc6 mutation - to be able to address these questions. Our experimental plan has three Specific Aims with the goal of providing answers to the above questions: (1) To ascertain whether mice with FSGS- or DN-mutations in Trpc6 develop FSGS with age or require a ?second hit? to manifest disease. (2) To characterize the effect of TRPC6 mutations on podocyte behaviors known to be affected in FSGS, focusing on regulation of their actin cytoskeleton, calcineurin-NFAT signaling, and cell death. (3) To determine the genes necessary for mutant TRPC6-induced cell death. Our proposed studies have the potential to significantly enhance our understanding of FSGS. They will help us understand how increased and decreased TRPC6 activity alters glomerular response to stress, and will clarify which of the known signaling pathways activated by TRPC6 mediate pathology. The research has the potential to uncover novel molecular mechanisms involved in regulating TRPC6 and promoting FSGS. Ultimately, the results will help determine whether blocking TRPC6 activity might be a potential, and much needed, new therapeutic approach for the treatment of FSGS."
"9386764","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The lung is a common portal of pathogen entry, and respiratory pathogen such as influenza and Mycobacterium tuberculosis are major global health problems. Thus, a major challenge of pulmonary vaccinology is to develop an approach that will provide long-lasting and durable immunity in the lung. One approach to this problem is the development of vaccines designed to promote the generation of lung-resident T cell memory. In animal models and human studies, memory T cells have been shown to significantly reduce viral loads after influenza challenge, leading to faster viral clearance and decreased disease severity. A key finding from these and other studies was that the protective efficacy of memory T cells directly correlated with the number of memory T cells present in the lung at the time of influenza challenge; as the number memory T cells in the lung declined, so did protection from pathogen challenge. Therefore, generating memory T cells that reside in the lung parenchyma and lung airways is a promising strategy to enhance cellular immunty to influenza or other respiratory pathogens. However, we still lack a basic understanding of how to generate and maintain tissue-resident memory T cells at the site of infection (the lung) where they are uniquely positioned to rapidly respond to a respiratory infection. Furthermore, we do not know the effector mechanisms that lung resident-memory cells use to provide protecitive immuniy. To improve cellular immunity against respiratory pathogens we must first acquire a better understanding of the mechanism(s) that underlie the generation, maintenance, and recall of tissue-resident memory T cells in the lung airways and lung parenchyma. This is the goal of the current proposal."

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Among the congenital cardiomyopathies, dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), and left ventricular non-compaction (LVNC) are the most prevalent forms. These cardiomyopathies cause either dilated (systolic) or restrictive (diastolic) physiology, life-threatening arrhythmias, and increased risk or thromboembolism. It is well known that many genetic causes are overlapping among DCM, HCM and LVNC; however, the prediction of specific phenotype is not yet possible because of lack of understanding on their molecular mechanisms. To overcome the problem, in this R01 grant, we will generate human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (iPSC-CMs) from patients with inherited DCM, HCM and LVNC as well as matched family controls and healthy unrelated controls. In order to clarify the detailed genotype-phenotype correlations, we will elucidate structural, electrophysiological, developmental, transcriptome, and mechanistic analyses using these patient-specific lines as well as genome-edited isogenic iPSC lines. Importantly, we will also perform studies among groups that manifest (a) same disease phenotype but different mutation genes, and (b) different disease phenotype which have different mutant alleles in the same genes. Collectively, these studies will uncover not only phenotype- specific underlying pathogenesis but also the mutation-specific pathogenesis in common genetic causes of congenital cardiomyopathies."
"9391685","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The mucosal surfaces (i.e., gut, mouth) of vertebrates are continuously exposed to endogenous and exogenous microbes. Throughout evolutionary time, specific immunoglobulin (Ig) isotypes have become specialized to protect such mucosal sites. In mammals and birds, IgA predominates at mucosal surfaces, whereas IgG and IgM provide systemic protection. Although mucosal Igs were thought to evolve in four legged (tetrapod) species, during the previous funding period, we discovered that fish contain an Ig isotype, IgT, that is specialized for gut mucosal immunity. Thereafter we discovered extraordinarily similar IgT responses occurred in other mucosal sites, including the skin and gills. Based on these results, we hypothesize that IgT responses in all fish mucosal areas (gut, gills and skin) operate under the guidance of primordially conserved principles. Thus, the overarching goal of this renewal is to test the hypothesis that pathogen-specific IgT responses are locally induced (Aim 1) in a T cell-dependent fashion (Aim 2), and lead to the generation of effector IgT+ B cells that generate protective IgT responses and maintain tissue homeostasis through the production of IL-10 (Aim 3). In addition, as we have found bacterial microbiota from gill, gut and skin prevalently coated by IgT, we hypothesize that commensal microbiota induce local T-cell independent IgT responses (Aim 2) and, that this IgT homeostatically regulates the microbiome at mucosal sites (Aim 3). Delineating strategies of immunoglobulin-based mucosal immunity in our model will not only illuminate unresolved paradigms of mucosal immune responses in non-tetrapods, but will also provide insights into responses. More specifically, our proposed studies are expected to: a) provide novel insights into the extrafollicular pathways by which IgA production is regulated in response to pathogens and microbiota; b) contribute towards the understanding of the roles of CD4+ T cells in generating IgA responses to pathogens and microbiota; c) provide ground-breaking knowledge on the mechanisms by which mucosal Igs control microbiota and its composition (microbiome) at multiple mucosal sites. Thus, the aims of this renewal are: AIM 1. To investigate the inductive and effector sites involved in the generation of IgT responses and, to analyze the existence of a common mucosal immune system (CMIS) in fish. To uncover the IgT inductive and effector sites, in vivo pathogen-induced B and T cell proliferative responses along with the visualization of B-Tcell interactions will be assessed in all MALTs and the spleen, using normal fish and a novel splenectomized fish model. Here we will also assess the existence of a common mucosal immune system (CMIS) by determining whether B/T cell responses induced at one mucosal site lead to effector responses at other distant mucosal areas. AIM 2. To investigate the T-cell dependency of IgT responses to pathogens and microbiota. Using an innovative CD4-T cell depletion fish model, we will assess fish mortality rate, pathogen load, B cell proliferative and pathogen-specific Ig responses. We will also evaluate the effect of CD4-T cell depletion on the composition of all gut, gill and skin microbiomes and the percentage of bacterial microbiota coated with IgT and IgM. To gain insight into the mechanisms by which IgT responses are modulated in the absence of CD4+ T cells, we will also    investigate the effect of CD4+ T cell depletion on the IgT sequence repertoire of all mucosal sites of na?ve and infected fish. AIM 3. To investigate the requirement of IgT+ B cells for the control of pathogens and bacterial microbiota. The goals of this aim will be accomplished using a powerful and novel IgT+ B cell depletion fish model. Fish mortality rates, tissue damage, pathogen load, complement activation and pathogen-specific systemic and mucosal Ig responses will be assessed in IgT+ B cell depleted fish upon pathogen challenge. Using the same fish models we will also evaluate changes in the microbiome composition of all mucosal sites and the percentage of bacterial microbiota coated with IgT and IgM."
