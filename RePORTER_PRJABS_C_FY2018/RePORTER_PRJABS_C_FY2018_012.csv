"9402541","Project Summary/Abstract: Genes in highly identical segmental duplications (SDs) play critical roles in human evolution and disease. SDs themselves mediate pathogenic duplications, deletions, and other rearrangements whose effects range from neurodevelopmental conditions like autism to syndromic congenital diseases. The genes contained within SDs, once duplicated, are fertile ground for adaptive tinkering, and may provide innovations that underlie the evolution of human-specific traits. However, the duplicate nature of these genes has always presented extra challenges to their study. They are found in regions of the genome that are some of the most difficult to sequence and assemble; they suffer from incomplete and inaccurate annotation due to the difficulty of correctly assigning and assembling sequenced fragments of transcripts; and related to this, for many duplicated genes it is not known if they are functional?i.e., if they encode a translated and functioning protein. This project seeks to annotate segmentally duplicated genes at the level of transcription and translation and proposes a strategy to address these challenges. We will leverage a haploid genome to better discriminate between highly identical copies of genome sequence, we will combine single-molecule long-read sequencing technology with a custom cDNA enrichment strategy to accurately determine transcription of SD genes, and we will take advantage of new developments in mass spectrometry technology to identify paralog-specific peptides and determine which of these genes are translated. The goal of this study is identify functional, protein-coding genes among segmentally duplicated regions of the human genome. The generalizable approach developed in this study can be applied to duplicated space in other genomes as well. These genes will serve as candidates for future studies of human evolution and disease. If successful, this study will shed enormous light onto one of the oldest and most challenging problems in the study of the human genome."
"9445961","Project Summary Despite intense efforts, the long-term cure rates of childhood and adult solid tumors such as rhabdoid tumors are not satisfactory. Resistance to intensive chemotherapy is nearly universal, and targets for molecular therapies are largely undefined. For example, inactivating mutations of SMARCB1 cause rhabdoid tumors, but their molecular pathophysiology and genetics remain poorly understood. We have now found that the majority of childhood and distinct adult solid tumors, including rhabdoid tumors, express PGBD5, a DNA transposase- derived human gene. We have now found that human rhabdoid and numerous solid tumors are characterized by previously unknown somatic deletions and inversions involving PGBD5-specific signal sequences (PSS) at their breakpoints. Remarkably, PGBD5's DNA transposase enzymatic activity is both necessary and sufficient for cell transformation, and induces recurrent and site-specific genomic rearrangements, leading to cooperative inactivation of tumor suppressor genes. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that defining the genetic and epigenetic mechanisms PGBD5-induced tumorigenesis will identify fundamental causes of PGBD5-induced solid tumors and refractory rhabdoid tumors in particular. The applicant will test this hypothesis by investigating the molecular mechanisms of PGBD5-induced cell transformation and rhabdoid tumorigenesis using primary human and genetically-engineered mouse tumors. Aim 1 will elucidate genetic and epigenetic mechanisms of PGBD5-induced cell transformation, with the goal of identifying PGBD5 targets that are necessary for malignant transformation, and molecular mechanisms that control their induction. Aim 2 will pursue the preliminary evidence that PGBD5-induced genomic rearrangements cooperate with SMARCB1 mutations in rhabdoid tumors and determine the function of PGBD5 using developmentally faithful mouse rhabdoid tumor models in vivo. Successful completion of this project is expected to yield essential molecular mechanisms of PGBD5-induced tumorigenesis, thus providing key insights into a fundamental biological and clinical problem, which should have broad and lasting significance for understanding and treating solid tumors."
"9398036","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The cause(s) of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) remain unknown, as well as the factors that result in the progression of this disease. No established medical treatments have yet been shown to benefit patients with this disease, and IPF continues to have a worse prognosis than many common malignancies. Recent findings of our research group, as well as others, show that autoantibodies are associated with IPF progression. Results of an early ongoing pilot study further indicate that specific treatments aimed at reducing pre-existing autoantibodies and/or minimizing their future production improve lung function among very ill IPF patients who are having disease exacerbations. We hypothesize that antibody-mediated autoimmunity can play an important role in IPF progression. The presence of autoimmunity could explain the refractoriness of this disease to current therapy, since many autoantibody lung diseases are resistant to treatment with corticosteroids. However, focused treatments targeted at autoantibodies or the lymphocytes that produce these immunoglobulins often have greater efficacy for these diseases than steroids or other nonspecific therapies.  Accordingly, we propose here a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase II clinical trial to explore the efficacy and safety of rituximab (anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody) vs. placebo, among patients with IPF. Fifty-eight (58) ambulatory IPF subjects at four participating U.S. medical centers will be randomized (1:1) to either the experimental arm (rituximab) or placebo. The primary end-point is a global assessment of circulating autoantibodies. Secondary end-points are measures of a specific autoantibody that is associated with clinical progression (anti-heat shock protein 70), as well as a measure of lung function (forced vital capacity), and adverse event rates. We anticipate the novel experimental treatment will show targeted efficacy for reduction of autoantibodies, a favorable safety profile, and possibly stabilization of lung function.  Results of these investigations will establish the efficacy and pharmacokinetics of rituximab treatment in IPF patients. Ultimately these studies could challenge current paradigms of IPF pathogenesis, and substantially alter treatment approaches to patients afflicted with this morbid, refractory disease."
"9413919","Project Summary Type 2 diabetes (T2D) afflicts 9% of the global population and is projected to affect 30% by 2050 if current trends continue. Recent reviews by the National Toxicology Program and World Health Organization indicate that this rise in T2D cannot be attributed solely to the increasing rate of obesity. Exposure to obesogenic and/or diabetogenic chemicals, alone or in conjunction with other environmental and lifestyle factors, may play a contributing role. Numerous population studies have found an association between exposure to inorganic arsenic (iAs) in drinking water and an increased incidence or prevalence of diabetes. These studies also indicate that metabolism of iAs (i.e. that facilitates clearance of iAs from the body) influences individual susceptibility to adverse effects of iAs exposure. Metabolism of iAs in humans occurs through enzymatic methylation, catalyzed by arsenic methyltransferase (AS3MT). Polymorphisms in AS3MT are associated with differences in iAs metabolism and with indicators of T2D. Methylation of iAs utilizes S-adenosylmethionine for methyl groups and folate is a dietary micronutrient that is required for SAM synthesis. Population studies find that high folate intake is associated with a more efficient iAs metabolism and decreased iAs toxicity. Thus, the efficiency of iAs metabolism, modifiable by polymorphisms in AS3MT or folate intake, may play an important role in the diabetogenic effects of iAs exposure. The proposed research will examine the role of iAs metabolism in the diabetogenic effects of iAs exposure, by studying As3mt-KO mice that cannot methylate iAs and restricting folate intake to decreased efficiency of iAs metabolism in wild-type mice. Additionally, this project will probe underlying mechanisms of iAs-associated diabetes, investigating effects on insulin secretion, insulin resistance, and promoter methylation of diabetes- associated genes. Preliminary studies found that As3mt-knockout mice, that do not methylate iAs, developed insulin resistance and obesity after exposure to moderate levels of iAs (~80-139 ppb) through laboratory diet. These data suggest that impaired iAs metabolism results in a diabetogenic phenotype. Thus, the specific aims of this project are to: 1. Compare the diabetogenic effects of low (~10 ppb) and moderate (~80-139 ppb) iAs exposures in As3mt-  knockout mice. 2. Characterize iAs metabolism and the diabetogenic effects of iAs exposure in wild-type mice with restricted  folate intake. Data on the role of iAs metabolism in the diabetogenic effects of iAs exposure and underlying mechanisms will facilitate risk assessment of iAs-associated diabetes and will inform strategies for prevention or treatment (such as dietary supplementation) of this disease in susceptible populations."
"9422761","The overall goal of this ancillary study is to determine if iron deficiency in frequent whole blood donors adversely affects their neurocognitive function. Over 15 million red blood cell units are donated annually in the United States. Despite fulfilling all requirements for blood donation, almost two-thirds of the women, and half of the men, who are regular blood donors are iron deficient. The overall intent of this study is to develop a chain of evidence linking iron repletion in iron-deficient donors to (i) increases of iron in specific brain structures to (ii) improved processing speed and memory with improved efficiency and connectivity in related functional networks by functional MRI to (iii) improved performance on neurocognitive testing. To this end, we will recruit from a prospective, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled parent trial of iron-deficient regular blood donors. In Aim #1, we will determine whether iron repletion of iron-deficient blood donors improves neurocognitive test performance. In Aim #2, we will determine whether iron repletion improves processing speed and episodic memory by altering activity and connectivity in specific functional networks at resting state. In Aim #3, we will determine whether iron repletion increases iron concentrations in specific brain structures. The neurocognitive impact of iron deficiency due to frequent blood donation has not been rigorously examined and this critical knowledge gap is addressed by this proposed ancillary study. Completing this study will provide definitive evidence for the presence or absence of iron deficiency-induced neurocognitive and neurological functional deficits in frequent blood donors. Our results will lead to improved policies and practices regarding iron supplementation, iron monitoring, and donation frequency."
"9456165","PROJECT SUMMARY  In recent years, the human fungal pathogen Candida albicans has become the fourth leading cause of hospital-acquired bloodstream infections, with close to 50,000 cases reported yearly in the United States. The number of yearly deaths in the U.S. due to systemic C. albicans infection now exceeds the number of deaths due to HIV. In a mouse model of systemic candidiasis that mimics disseminated candidiasis in humans, progressive sepsis accompanied by renal failure was identified as the cause of death.  Recently, we evaluated mice lacking the proteins Sts-1 and Sts-2 for susceptibility to systemic C. albicans infection. In striking contrast to wild-type mice, which succumb to pyelonephritis within days of infection, Sts-/- mice were profoundly resistant to infection. The Sts-null phenotype was associated with enhanced pathogen clearance, sharply diminished levels of many inflammatory molecules beginning at 24 hours post infection, a reduction in kidney leukocyte infiltrates, and an absence of inflammatory lesions.  The Sts proteins are characterized by a distinctive C-terminal histidine phosphatase domain, making them structurally and enzymatically very distinct from other phosphatases. Their singular enzymatic properties suggest they are attractive therapeutic targets. We hypothesize that drug-mediated inhibition of Sts enzyme activity will generate a unique host response that will support rapid reduction in host fungal burden and prevent the destructive inflammation that accompanies systemic C. albicans infection. Our long-term goal is to develop a small molecule drug to be used in combination therapy for the treatment of life threatening C. albicans infections. Critical to this effort is demonstrating that the Sts proteins are valid biological targets whose inhibition will enhance host immune responses.  In this study, we will establish the Sts proteins as viable drug targets and conduct a 100,000 compound drug discovery effort. We will accomplish our objectives by completing the following Specific Aims: 1) Establish the feasibility of selectively inhibiting Sts phosphatase activity with small molecules. 2) Establish the feasibility of targeting the Sts enzymes to treat systemic candidiasis. This proposal is innovative because it exploits a novel and potentially highly effective mechanism to treat C. albicans infections. The proposed studies are significant because their successful completion will establish a new paradigm for anti-fungal combination therapy. The long-term success of this work has the potential to significantly reduce the morbidity and mortality attributed to systemic Candida infections."
"9399676","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The design of the Collaborative Pediatric Critical Care Research Network (CPCCRN) is to investigate the efficacy of treatment and management strategies to care for critically ill children and understand the basic pathophysiological mechanisms of critical illness. CN has been part of the CPCCRN since its inception as an active and successful enrollment site, a constructive and creative presence in the development of CPCCRN research directions and protocols, and has lead in protocol development. The first goal of this proposal is to renew the participation of Children's National in the CPCCRN and participate in a manner that brings innovative, diverse, and unique skills to the CPCCRN. To achieve this goal, CN has restructured its leadership team to include leading researchers in outcomes research, cardiac critical care, and trauma and critical care. This team is also exceptionally experienced at both collaborating in, and leading multi-site studies. To better utilize the full scope of expertise in the Children's Research Institute, the leadership plan is explicit in its intent to collaboratively and constructively involve this expertise, internally thrugh the CN organizational structure and to the CPCCRN when it is appropriate to offer the expertise. Second, Children's National intends to improve the outcomes of critically ill children by both leading as well as participating in studies of the development of morbidity and mortality. As a demonstration of this commitment and expertise, we have presented the concept proposal The Association of PICU Care-Team Performance with Morbidity and Mortality. This proposal conceptually outlines the framework for answering the question: Can improving ICU care-team performance improve patient outcomes such as morbidity and mortality? The proposal outlines the process for measuring and testing the important components of team performance. It would develop generalizable methodology and reach conclusions that would be applicable to areas of medicine where team- based care is important. The concept proposal also demonstrates the intent to utilize interdisciplinary and network expertise."
"9445083","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Compulsive behaviors are prominent, disabling, and often treatment-resistant symptoms of several neuropsychiatric disorders, including obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD). Dysfunction within fronto- subcortical brain structures is thought to underlie compulsive behaviors, but the precise circuits involved remain unknown. Currently, chronic (> 4 weeks) treatment with serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SRIs) provides the only effective pharmacological monotherapy for compulsive behaviors; yet, approximately 50% of OCD patients do not respond to SRIs. We have shown that serotonin 1B receptors (5-HT1BRs) regulate the expression of compulsive behaviors. 5-HT1BRs are located on axon terminals of serotonin-containing neurons (presynaptic), and neurons containing other neurotransmitters (postsynaptic)(3), where they inhibit neurotransmitter release when activated. Furthermore, 5-HT1BRs signal through both a canonical G protein- mediated pathway, and a noncanonical G protein-independent pathway. Canonical 5-HT1BR-mediated Gi- signaling requires direct interaction of 5-HT1BRs with glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta (GSK3?). On the other hand, the intracellular scaffolding protein beta arrestin-2 (?-arrestin2) mediates noncanonical 5-HT1BR signaling. We recently found that activation of 5-HT1BRs within the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) is necessary and sufficient to induce compulsive behaviors in mice. The OFC contains both pre- and postsynaptic 5-HT1BRs, including those on dorsal raphe-OFC and basolateral amygdala (BLA)-OFC projections, respectively. We propose to develop and use a two virus, in vivo CRISPR-Cas9 system to dissect the role of 5-HT1BR density and canonical versus noncanonical signaling within these two circuits in modulating compulsive behaviors. In Specific Aim 1, we will either overexpress or knockout 5-HT1BR expression within these two projections. We will infuse 1) a Cre recombinase (Cre) dependent adeno-associated virus (AAV) which expresses either 5- HT1BR, or the S. aureus Cas9 (SaCas9) gene plus a guide sequence against 5-HT1BR, into the dorsal raphe or BLA, and 2) a Cre-expressing retrograde canine adenovirus (CAV2-cre) into the OFC. In Specific Aim 2, we will also use the two virus, in vivo CRISPR-Cas9 system, but will infuse a Cre-dependent AAV expressing SaCas9 and a guide sequence against either ?-arrestin2 or GSK3? into the dorsal raphe or BLA. Mice will be evaluated for 5-HT1BR agonist-induced compulsive behaviors in the open field, a delayed alternation task, and an operant paradigm assessing both acquisition and persistence of habitual lever pressing. The proposed work could establish a novel in vivo CRISPR-Cas9 system for manipulating gene expression within specific neural circuits, and could lead to innovative therapeutic strategies for treating compulsions."
"9402080","Project Summary/Abstract Visual systems must be matched (via evolution and learning over the lifespan) to the natural tasks organisms perform to survive and reproduce. Thus, it is of fundamental importance to analyze visual systems with respect to natural tasks and with respect to the statistical properties of natural stimuli relevant to performing those tasks. In our lab we call this ?natural systems analysis.? This novel approach to vision science is composed of several steps: (1) identify natural tasks, (2) measure the natural scene statistics relevant for those tasks, (3) determine how to optimally use those statistics to perform the tasks, given appropriate biological constraints, and (4) use the first three steps to formulate principled hypotheses which are tested and refined in behavioral or physiological experiments. Using a unique suite of measurement devices, computational tools, and psychophysical paradigms developed in our laboratory, we propose to tackle (within the framework of natural systems analysis) several fundamental tasks involving estimation of local properties in natural scenes: (Aim 1) detection of occluding and partially-occluded targets in natural images, (Aim 2) detection of depth edges created by occluding surfaces and estimation local 3D surface orientation at the non-depth edge locations within those surfaces, and (Aim 3) estimation of disparity and local 2D motion. Many of the proposed studies will be the first to precisely characterize the statistical constraints in natural images underlying the visual system's ability to perform these tasks accurately. Many of the proposed studies will also be the first to measure performance in these fundamental tasks using natural stimuli. The product of the studies will be not only unique new measurements, but principled new models that can predict human performance under natural conditions and guide future neurophysiological studies of the underlying mechanisms. Strong preliminary results have been obtained in the previous project period for many of the proposed studies.  "

"9403239","Abstract Epidemiological, clinical and animal model research has shown that tobacco cigarette smoke (TCS) is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD) and metabolic disorders such as hypertension, coronary heart disease, dyslipidemia, and diabetes. Nicotine (NIC), the addicting chemical of TCS, is believed to play a major role in much of the damage induced by TCS. Chronic NIC inhalation has been observed to play a pathogenic role in the induction and progression of CVD. NIC can induce direct coronary spasm and ischemia. It also stimulates both autonomic ganglia and nerve terminals and upregulates numerous vasoconstrictors, inflammatory mediators, cytokines and oxidative markers that play a role in inducing cardiovascular disease. Vascular endothelial dysfunction (VED) and inflammation with enhanced reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation have been detected in many cardiovascular and metabolic disorders associated with NIC exposure. However, fundamental questions remain regarding: 1) the underlying mechanisms by which NIC inhalation (NICI) induces CVD; 2) the correlation between disease and the dose of NIC delivered during exposure; 3) the temporal effects of the dose of NIC delivered on the progression of disease; and 4) possible pharmacological approaches to minimize, arrest or reverse NICI-induced disease. Our research plan will provide answers to these questions using a controlled mouse model with available genetic modifications to explore the disease mechanisms. There are 3 specific aims: 1) To determine the duration and dose intensity required to induce NICI-mediated CVD and VED in a controlled mouse NICI model. The effects of NIC on heart rate, blood pressure, heart structure and function, vascular reactivity, endothelial nitric oxide (NO) production that is critical for normal vascular function, endothelial NO synthase (eNOS), leukocyte activation and ROS formation will be determined. 2) With the doses and duration of NICI that produce CVD and VED, the molecular mechanisms involved will be elucidated. The basis for the alterations in NO production will be determined by investigating the effects of NICI on eNOS levels and functional state, as modulated by its critical cofactor tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4), eNOS redox modification by S-glutathionylation, and its oxidative degradation. The role of leukocyte or tissue NADPH oxidase will be determined with superoxide production from this enzyme measured along with the expression and cellular localization of its subunits. Mice will be studied with knockout of critical NADPH oxidase subunits to assess the role of this critical enzyme in CVD and VED. Superoxide dismutase (SOD) over-expressing transgenic mice will be used to assess the role of superoxide. 3) With the knowledge obtained on the mechanism of NIC-induced CVD, we will evaluate interventions aimed at preventing or ameliorating NICI-induced CVD and VED. This research will provide important insights toward understanding the process and mechanisms of NIC inhalation-induced CVD and identify approaches to minimize or reverse it."
"9397572","PROJECT SUMMARY Plakophilin-2 (PKP2) is a component of the desmosome. Recent studies have demonstrated that PKP2 also acts as a scaffold for an intracellular signaling complex, and as part of the microtubule anchoring platform at the site of cell contact. Mutations in PKP2 associate with about 50% of cases of arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) of known genetic origin. ARVC is an inherited disease characterized by replacement of ventricular mass with fibrous and fatty tissue, and an increased susceptibility to ventricular arrhythmias and sudden death in the young. Our long-term goals are to: 1) establish the cellular origin of the fibroblasts and adipocytes that populate the ventricular wall in an ARVC-affected heart, and 2) define the molecular mechanisms that act on the progenitor cell population to bring about the disease phenotype. We focus on epicardial cells, a cardiac-resident pluripotent stem cell population that gives rise to various non- myocyte cardiac cells, including fibroblasts. Our central hypothesis is that, in epicardial cells in situ, PKP2 deficiency disrupts the structure of intercellular junctions and their associated intracellular signaling nodes; this disruption alters cellular function and leads to a pro-fibrotic, pro-arrhythmogenic phenotype. Our Specific Aims are: 1) To define the molecular anatomy of intercellular junctions, and the structure/function of the corresponding intracellular signaling platforms in epicardial cells. Hypothesis: We postulate that in epicardial cells, PKP2 is a functional component of: a) the intercellular junctions, b) the anchoring platform for the microtubule plus-end, and c) the scaffolding of an intracellular signaling hub that includes beta-catenin, PKC?, and RhoA. We further propose that in epicardial cells, loss of PKP2 expression leads to separation and loss of components of both the intercellular junction and the signaling node, thus driving ?among other events- Rho-dependent MRTF activity, with the consequent activation of the motile gene program that facilitates the fibrotic phenotype. 2) To characterize the consequences of PKP2 deficiency on epicardial cell function, and their impact on cardiac anatomy and electrophysiology. Hypothesis: We propose that PKP2 deletion in epicardial cells in vivo drives excessive mobilization of epicardium-derived progenitor cells and their subsequent differentiation into fibro-fatty tissue both during development and in response to cardiac injury. We further propose that expansion of the epicardium-derived fibroblast population upon injury creates heterogeneously-distributed anatomic obstacles for propagation of the electrical impulse, and that these obstacles differ in dimensions depending on PKP2 expression."
"9457570","Damage to or loss of the peripheral axons of primary sensory neurons is associated with two clinical syndromes: peripheral neuropathic pain and peripheral neuropathy. Treatment for neuropathic pain is typically ineffective or associated with side effects, and there is no treatment for peripheral neuropathy. To remedy this, it is essential that the mechanisms responsible for both are understood and targets identified that could be amenable to development of novel therapeutics. My goal is to dissect out at an individual neuron level the transcriptional and functional changes that occur over time in response to physical axonal injury, ion channel mutations and exposure to neurotoxic cancer chemotherapeutic agents, and explore the extent to which hyperexcitability and axon degeneration are linked. This will involve combinations of several different approaches: correlating single cell profiles and disease related functional changes, identifying disease susceptibility in patient stem derived neurons, high content phenotypic screens, population imaging in intact animals, genetic editing, and interrogation at high temporal and spatial resolution of behavioral surrogates of pain and sensory loss. The project will focus on neuropathic pain due to physical disruption of peripheral sensory axons, small fiber neuropathies due to voltage-gated sodium channel mutations and chemotherapy- induced peripheral neuropathy, and will examine if these syndromes are distinct or part of a spectrum of sensory neuron pathologies with overlapping risk factors and mechanisms."
"9446146","Project Summary / Abstract Vascular occlusive disease remains a critical cardiovascular health issue with about 500,000 percutaneous coronary and 50,000 peripheral balloon angioplasties performed annually in the US alone. Hemodynamically relevant restenoses through neointimal hyperplasia occur in 10 to 30% of patients. Vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) migration significantly contributes to neointimal hyperplasia after vascular injury. VSMC migration is a Ca2+-dependent process; migrating cells must maintain cytosolic Ca2+ gradients and create local Ca2+ pulses near the leading edge likely to accomplish dynamic cytoskeletal turnover. Mitochondria are one of the major buffers of intracellular Ca2+ in VSMC and participate in localized Ca2+ responses. In other cell types, cell migration is dependent upon mitochondrial localization to the leading edge. Thus, we propose that mitochondria provide localized control of Ca2+ transients, serving to facilitate VSMC migration. Previous work from our group established that the multifunctional Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) is a key regulator of VSMC cell migration and proliferation. In more recent studies, we discovered that CaMKII is present and active in the mitochondrial matrix, where it is believed to promote mitochondrial matrix Ca2+ influx. In preliminary studies, mitoCaMKII inhibition in VSMC in a novel transgenic model developed in our laboratory blocks neointimal hyperplasia in vivo. Moreover, mitoCaMKII inhibition blocks mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake, mitochondrial mobility and VSMC migration. These data position mitochondrial CaMKII (mitoCaMKII) as a gatekeeper of mitochondrial function and of key VSMC phenotypes relevant for neointimal hyperplasia. In this this application, we will directly test our working hypothesis that mitoCaMKII inhibition blocks mitochondrial matrix Ca2+ uptake, thereby affecting mitochondrial mobility and VSMC migration and ultimately neointimal hyperplasia. We will test our working hypothesis in two aims: 1. Determine whether mitoCaMKII in VSMC controls neointimal formation through regulation of mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake and 2. Dissect the pathways and mechanisms by which mitoCaMKII controls VSMC migration. Studies will include in vivo analysis of neointimal formation using novel transgenic models of mitoCaMKII inhibition or overexpression and in vitro imaging of localized Ca2+ dysregulation, including ER/mitochondrial Ca2+ transition, Ca2+ waves and flickers as well as analysis of cytoskeleton and focal adhesion turnover. Moreover, novel pathways that link mitochondrial matrix Ca2+ uptake to VSMC migration will be tested. It is anticipated that the successful completion of the proposed studies will provide mechanistic insight into how changes in mitochondrial function lead to VSMC migration and neointimal formation. Such knowledge could lead to first-in-class, mitochondria- targeted therapies for vascular disease, in particular neointimal hyperplasia."
"9393689","PROJECT SUMMARY The central goal of the Wake Forest Translational Alcohol Research Center (WF-TARC) is to employ animal models and human subjects research to study behavioral and neurobiological substrates associated with vulnerability (and resilience) to alcohol use disorder (AUD). This Center builds on a highly productive translational alcohol research program at WFSM that was recently established with NIAAA developmental program project (P01) support. The WF-TARC will have four research projects and two cores. An administrative core will provide the leadership and infrastructure needed to ensure integration across all research projects, provide biostatistical support, and promote interactions and communication between this Center and the many other addiction- related research and educational programs at Wake Forest School of Medicine (WFSM). A pilot project core will be established to advance the goals and objectives of the WF-TARC. This core will fund four projects each year to attract new investigators to bring their talent and expertise to the study of AUD vulnerability. The unifying research focus of the WF-TARC will be to leverage the strengths and advantages of animal models and human subjects research to study behavioral correlates of AUD vulnerability and identify neurobiological adaptations that contribute to this heightened risk of developing AUD. Studies will employ cutting-edge, multidisciplinary experimental approaches spanning molecular, cellular, circuit, and whole-brain analyses. Importantly, each project will evaluate novel interventions targeted at the reversing the maladaptive neural adaptations that promote AUD vulnerability. The highly-integrated conceptual framework and research design will facilitate backward and forward interactions between the projects, facilitating the rapid translation of therapeutic discoveries from animals to humans. The WF-TARC takes advantage of a well-established, extremely collaborative translational alcohol research program at WFSM and will benefit from a strong and growing institutional focus on alcohol and drug addiction research. This Center will further enhance the outstanding educational environment at our institution, providing unique training opportunities for the students and postdoctoral who will become the next generation of translational alcohol researchers. Finally, the innovative research that will be supported by the WF-TARC may lead to better evidence-based therapies for individuals who are at greatest risk of developing AUD, individuals who are particularly ill-served by current AUD treatment options."

"9469995","The long-term goal of the principal investigator?s research is to elucidate the interactions between the mosquito vector and Zika virus (ZIKV) and Dengue virus (DENV), to identify transmission-blocking targets suitable for the development of disease control strategies. During their journey through the vector, the viruses engage in intimate interactions with the mosquito midgut and other tissues, relying on numerous mosquito-derived agonists (host factors). ZIKV and DENV can be impaired in the vector by agonist deletion through gene editing, depletion through RNA interference, or blocking / interference / inhibition through antibodies. Hence, an obvious advantage of studying virus agonists for disease control is that they can be targeted through multiple means. The recently developed CRISPR/CAS9-based gene editing in Aedes mosquitoes provide new and promising opportunities for the study of agonist function through gene deletion, and could be used to develop novel ZIKV and DENV control strategies. Here we will focus on 10 virus agonists to assess their potential for disease control and further our knowledge of their involvement in ZIKV and DENV infection. In Aim 1, we will validate 6 putative DENV agonists for ZIKV blocking potential in Ae. aegypti using RNAi-mediated gene silencing. In Aim 2, we will develop CRISPR/CAS9-mediated conditional bloodmeal-inducible midgut-specific gene KO mosquitoes for selected ZIKV and DENV agonists. In Aim 3, we will assess these KO Ae. aegypti lines for resistance to virus infection and their fitness impact in terms of mosquito longevity and fecundity."

The conference will be held February 25 ? March 1, 2018 in Austin, Texas. This symposium will primarily focus on integrating current knowledge concerning the cellular and molecular regulation of memory T and B cell responses with their role in mediating protection against infections. In addition to the significant impact these cell populations have on vaccination, emphasis will be placed on their therapeutic and pathogenic roles in cancer, autoimmunity and chronic infection. The innate immune response has a profound influence on the regulation of effector and memory T and B cell responses, and recent discoveries in this area bring forth a greater understanding of the major signals that govern both the formation and the long-term maintenance of these populations. These conceptual advancements will be a major part of the symposium. Recently, it has become clear that there is marked phenotypic and functional heterogeneity of T cell responses; how this affects immunological protection will be discussed. Finally, this symposium will include discussion of recent advances in assessing memory T and B cell responses in a sensitive manner in human and non-human primates, as well as murine systems, to enable better elucidation of the state of the immune response during infection and vaccination, which will lead to more rationale vaccine design."
"9456554","Coccidioides posadasii and Coccidioides immitis are both filamentous fungi and the causative agents of coccidioidomycosis, commonly known as Valley Fever. Over the past several decades, valley fever cases have increased dramatically, and the endemic range has expanded with recent verification of the organism in soil in Eastern Washington. These fungi are primary pathogens that can be responsible for morbidity and mortality in otherwise healthy patients, and disease can vary from asymptomatic to lethal. The underlying reasons for disease variation, and the role fungal genotype plays, represents a major gap in our knowledge. Our overall knowledge of the biology of Coccidioides is limited. The proposed project will define an entirely new life cycle stage, with high impact both for disease as well as understanding evolutionary potential. The existence of an ascospore that could be infectious, and have differential infection dynamics would explain at least in part, disease variation in human patients. Ascospores are also often resting structures in the environment that may provide environmental refugia for the fungus. Finally, recombined offspring may have novel phenoytpes that can adapt to new hosts and environments. The project will use standard mycological media and techniques to validate our preliminary results. Our approach will be focused on using genomic sequencing to define recombination patterns and frequency. Gaining an understanding of the mechanism of recombination, and potential new infectious spore type could greatly affect how disease prevalence and complications are viewed. This strategy will elucidate differences among recombinant Coccidioides strains for phenotypes such as stress tolerance, antifungal resistance, and pathogenicity, and determine if this is a mechanism of disease variation. The outcomes will fundamentally change our understanding of Coccidioides biology. The knowledge gained will allow for new genetic and mechanistic studies of Coccidioides."

"9394816","SUMMARY  Women with delayed menopause and those who give birth to children later in life show less cardiovascular disease and live longer than other women. Women with constitutively long leukocyte telomere length (LTL) have delayed menopause, show less cardiovascular disease and also live longer than other women. The central hypothesis of this proposal is a logical extension of these findings. It posits that women who bear children later in life without the use of assisted reproductive technologies might have a constitutively long LTL. A corollary of this hypothesis is that offspring of these women might have a long LTL as well, given that LTL is highly heritable. Moreover, children born to older women are typically conceived by older men. As the offspring's LTL is positively associated with paternal age at the time of conception of the offspring, LTL of offspring conceived by older women might be constitutively longer than average due to the joint effects of heritability of a longer LTL from the mothers and being conceived by older fathers. This central hypothesis and its corollary will be tested in the Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort Study (MoBa) ? a pregnancy and birth cohort with a Biobank of leukocyte DNA samples and a comprehensive dataset. The aims of the study are: 1) measure LTL in 1700 mothers who gave birth at ages 18 years or older, including 1000 mothers who gave birth at the age 35 years and older; 2) measure LTL in 300 mothers who gave birth at the age of 35 years and older with the aid of in-vitro fertilization; 3) measure LTL in the 2,000 fathers (the sexual partners) of the mothers in aims 1 and 2); and 4) measure LTL in newborns of these parents and perform an instrumental variable analysis, further exploring the relationship between maternal LTL and fecundity. Learning about LTL using the mother-father-newborn study design will broaden our understanding of the familial framework of female fecundity and of having long (and short) LTL. This understanding is vital for public health, given that LTL is associated with a host of aging-related disorders and with longevity in contemporary humans.  "

"9423686","ABSTRACT Biosynthetic metabolic pathways provide the building blocks required for cell growth and generate important cell signaling molecules, including reactive species. When dysregulated, these pathways can contribute to brain pathologies including brain tumors. We determined that one biosynthetic pathway involving GTP cyclohydrolase I (GCH1) as the rate-limiting step contributes to the growth of brain tumors and is elevated in the neoplastic stem cell subpopulation. In patient sample datasets, increased levels of GCH1 also correlate with poor outcomes. These data suggest the importance of understanding the biological and molecular roles of GCH1. We have therefore proposed to determine if GCH1 is critical for regulating reactive species balance in glioma and maintaining neoplastic stem cell characteristics. Potential novel downstream mediators of GCH1 effects will be validated. Pharmacologic and genetic inhibition of GCH1 will determine if targeting of GCH1 is sufficient to decrease glioma growth alone or in combination with standard of care. We anticipate these studies will determine if GCH1 or another molecule in the same biosynthetic pathway should be a further investigated as a biomarker for either outcome or therapeutic response. We hope that our studies will provide a greater understanding of the mechanisms through which metabolism is altered in brain disease and inform future novel treatment strategies."
"9402542","PROJECT SUMMARY Recent advances in genome sciences have allowed for early applications of precision medicine. While the genes causing over 4,000 Mendelian diseases have been identified, many leading to new diagnostics and therapeutics, most diseases prove more complicated. For over a decade, researchers have looked for genetic variation that is linked to these more complex diseases through genome wide association studies. While this avenue of research has generated over 18,000 unique variants linked to disease, the interpretation of these variants, and therefore their application to clinical medicine, remains unresolved. Recently, several groups have identified that many of these variants overlap enhancer elements, regions of DNA responsible for the spatiotemporal expression of genes. In this proposal, I aim to functionally validate and interpret the roles of thousands of these variants in complex disease. To do so, I am developing novel technologies with broad application to genome sciences and proteomics. I am developing methods to generate complex libraries of DNA to test, in which I can program specific variation. This same technology has been adopted by others to design proteins with novel functions. I am also developing a novel assay to test the effects of thousands of these variants on enhancer function with unprecedented sequence and chromosomal context. Together, these methods permit the simultaneous analysis of thousands of predefined enhancer variants. This study will provide insight into the genetic basis of complex traits and may guide the development of novel diagnostics and therapeutics."

"9404036","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Most membrane and secreted proteins are decorated with mucin-type O-glycans which serve diverse biological roles. The mechanisms behind their biological roles and more specifically what governs O-glycan site selection and subsequent O-glycan elongation are largely unknown. The objective of this project is to elucidate the processes governing O-glycan site selection and O-glycan elongation at the enzyme and peptide substrate level in order to address the molecular mechanisms and biology of O-glycosylation. Mucin type O- glycosylation is vital to animal reproduction and development and increasingly linked to a wide range of rare to common disease states (such as hormonal/metabolic dysfunction, impaired host defense, inflammatory and cardiovascular diseases and even cancers) where it serves to modulate diverse biological functions including cell-cell interactions. Many disorders are linked to changes in expression or mutation of individual members of the large family (20 in man) of polypeptide-GalNAc transferases (ppGalNAc Ts) that initiate O-glycosylation by adding GalNAc to polypeptide Ser or Thr residues. O-glycosylation is absolutely required for embryonic development of the mouse and fly, relying on the Core 1 elongating transferase (T-synthase) in the mouse and several individual ppGalNAc T isoforms in the fly. How individual ppGalNAc T isoforms in this large family (or even T-synthase) can play such critical biological roles is unknown as the substrate specificity of these transferases have not been sufficiently characterized. That ppGalNAc T site selection is also modulated (positively or negatively) by prior glycosylation underscores its complexity and how much more needs to be learned of its specificity. The detailed characterization of ppGalNAc T isoform and elongating transferase specificity proposed in this project will lead to our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the biological roles of O-glycosylation and will eventually lead to novel strategies to treat diseases of aberrant O- glycosylation. The AIMS of this project are to (1) expand the innovative use of a library of novel random peptide and glycopeptide substrates to fully characterize the specificity and basic enzymology of the transferases that initiate and elongate mucin type O-glycosylation, (2) to use these data to further develop sophisticated web based O-glycan predictive tools that include ppGalNAc T isoform and elongating transferase peptide and glycopeptide specificity, and (3) to develop a novel method for identifying in vivo isoform specific glycosylation targets using tissues from transferase knock-out animal models. These basic studies together with those of colleagues at other institutions will advance our understanding of the properties of these transferases, their targets (and resultant glycan structures) and ultimately the mechanisms of their biological role and function. These studies will significantly advance the field and will allw the development of novel specific inhibitors for potential use as targeted therapeutics."
"9402115","PROJECT SUMMARY Following myocardial infarction (MI), patients have an increased risk of ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death. Remodeling of the cardiac sympathetic nervous system (SNS) occurs post-MI and recent experimental and clinical studies suggest that both sympathetic hyperinnervation and denervation are associated with ventricular arrhythmias. Adverse electrophysiological (EP) remodeling also occurs post-MI and includes changes to ion channels, gap junctions, and Ca2+ handling that can lead to both the trigger and substrate for ventricular arrhythmia. Individually, many SNS and EP factors have been linked to ventricular arrhythmias. However, the precise mechanisms by which post-MI SNS remodeling contributes to ? and interacts with ? EP remodeling have never been systematically investigated. The overall objective of this project is to determine the individual and interacting roles of SNS and EP remodeling in producing the triggers and substrate for ventricular arrhythmias post-MI, which may unveil novel anti-arrhythmic strategies. To meet this objective, an innovative set of methodologies has been developed, including novel approaches for modulation of cardiac innervation combined with dual optical mapping of Vm and intra-sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca2+ in the intact, fully innervated Langendorff-perfused rabbit heart. Aim 1 will focus on acute effects of SNS stimulation in the normal heart and how SR and intracellular Ca2+ handling play a role in mediating arrhythmogenic changes. Experiments will address the hypothesis that SNS-dependent effects on SR Ca2+ and Ca2+i generate triggers for arrhythmia and modulate repolarization to create the substrate for reentry. The impact of non-classical neurotransmitters in mediating these effects will also be examined. Aim 2 will determine the impact of chronic SNS remodeling (hyper- or denervation) on arrhythmogenesis, including the role of Ca2+ handling in mediating these effects. Here, hyper- or denervation will be created independent of MI, allowing for the separation of MI-induced changes from SNS remodeling. The contributions of acute SNS stimulation and circulating catecholamines to hyper- or denervation-induced arrhythmias will be examined. Aim 3 will focus on the interplay between SNS remodeling and EP remodeling in the post-MI rabbit heart and novel anti-arrhythmic strategies aimed at preventing SNS remodeling will be tested. The results of this study will provide unprecedented mechanistic insight into the individual and synergistic contributions of SNS and EP remodeling in post-MI arrhythmogenesis and will determine whether targeting key nerve-heart interactions represents a novel therapeutic approach."
"9447407","Summary Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), one of the most aggressive types of cancer that manifests resistance to virtually all conventional targeted therapies and hormonal treatments (e.g. tamoxifen, TAM), is particularly en- riched in a high content of cancer stem cells (CSCs), a sub-population of cancer cells account for cancer pro- gression, therapy resistance, and recurrence. In recent years, a widely prescribed diabetes drug, Metformin (metformin hydrochloride), has shown promise in treatment of breast cancer, including TNBC. However, the molecular target(s) and the key mechanism underlying metformin mediated anti-tumor effects, particularly for the regulation of CSCs, still remain elusive.  Our preliminary data for this study provides novel evidence showing that metformin treatment in TNBC cells leads to activation of selective microRNAs (MI-miRs: miR-200c, miR-152, miR-448, miR-377) that to- gether target and suppress PKC?, a cell polarity protein that plays a central role in maintenance of the self-re- newing stem cell fate decision. Inhibition of PKC? by metformin in turn directs luminal differentiation of the TNBC-CSCs with re-expression of ER?, which allows for sensitization of TNBC cells to TAM in vitro. Further- more, the pilot findings also reveal that a metformin-resistant CSC population would emerge under long term metformin treatment and exhibit significantly enhanced expression of histone methyltransferase EZH2, which potentially mediates silencing of the MI-miRs to sustain PKC? expression and thereby promotes the resistant CSC pool and tumor progression. Based on the evidence, it is our expectation that a precise delineation of the underlying mechanism governing CSC response (self-renewal vs. differentiation) to metformin likely holds the key to the development of an effective and stratified therapeutic strategy that can be used to eradicate TNBC. To test the hypothesis, we propose to first determine the mechanism(s) governing metformin-induced CSC differentiation and TAM sensitization (Aim 1) by delineating PKC?-mediated signaling regulation underlying TNBC response to metformin-induced luminal differentiation and TAM sensitization. Next, we will determine strategies to overcome metformin resistance and enhance the therapeutic effect of metformin on TNBC (Aim 2) by testing whether metformin combined with TAM will be effective in abrogation of TNBC stemness as well as tumor growth in TNBC patient-derived xenograft mouse models. We will also examine whether a clinical trial tested selective EZH2 inhibitor, tazemetostat, can re-direct metformin-resistant CSCs to metformin-induced differentiation and re-sensitize resistant TNBC to TAM in vivo. Furthermore, using a newly-established TNBC animal model (Brca1f/fp53+/-;Ezh2) and the annotated patient specimens from a phase III metformin trial in breast cancer, we will determine the role of metformin-induced signaling cascade in TNBC development and treatment response (Aim 3), leading to novel stratification biomarkers with clinicopathological and prognostic relevance to ensure effective metformin/TAM treatment regimens. "

"9472077","PROJECT SUMMARY Carcinoma progression depends on the interactions of epithelial tumor cells with their surrounding stroma. Fibroblasts represent a principal component of this stroma, which modulates tumor cell behavior through diverse mechanisms, including the synthesis of growth and angiogenic factors, cytokines, extracellular matrix components and proteases. Indeed, many solid tumors exhibit striking histological evidence of fibroblast proliferation and activation, termed desmoplasia. Although desmoplasia in human cancers tightly correlates with poor prognosis, the molecular mechanisms that generate and maintain this desmoplastic response remain unknown. In preliminary studies, we have uncovered that autophagy in stromal fibroblasts is crucial for promoting both desmoplasia and tumor progression. Autophagy is a tightly regulated lysosomal degradation process that promotes tumor cell survival and metabolic adaptation. There is great interest in targeting autophagy against cancer due to its well-established effects on tumor cell survival; however, the potential pro- tumorigenic functions of autophagy in the host stroma remain unknown. We hypothesize that autophagy in stromal fibroblasts is critical to initiate and maintain a desmoplastic fibrotic response and to facilitate tumor progression. Using powerful immune-competent mammary cancer models and tools uniquely developed in our laboratory, we will rigorously scrutinize the functions of stromal fibroblast autophagy during cancer progression in vivo. In Aim 1, we will determine how autophagy in stromal fibroblasts modulates tissue stiffness and ECM remodeling. In Aim 2, we will dissect how autophagy-dependent secretion by stromal fibroblasts promotes carcinoma progression and influences the tumor microenvironment. In Aim 3, we will corroborate the effects of stromal fibroblast autophagy in mammary cancer progression and metastasis using autochthonous tumor models. These studies will provide unique conceptual insight into whether and how the autophagy pathway in host fibroblasts can be modulated to abolish the stromal response required for cancer progression."
"9591100","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This R21/R33 application is a test of concept study and potentially able to facilitate the development of novel non-traditional therapeutics that provides alternative treatment for infected patients.  Emerging antibiotic-resistant strains of bacteria pose a significant threat to general health and welfare. Phagocytosis, along with other innate immune responses, exerts crucial impacts on the outcomes of the patients suffered from bacterial infections. In this proposal, we will use macrophages as a cellular model to develop a novel approach in order to enhance the myeloid cell-mediated phagocytosis and clearance of antibiotic-resistant bacteria.      Based on our published and preliminary data, we found that miR-15a/16 attenuates phagocytosis and bacterial clearance by targeting on the TLR4-associated pathways in vitro. Deletion of miR-15a/16 (miR- 15a/16-/-) in myeloid cells significantly decreases the bacterial infection-associated mortality in septic mice. Consistently, miR-15a/16 deficiency (miR-15a/16-/-) results in augmented phagocytosis and generation of bactericidal reactive oxygen species (ROS) in macrophages. Our preliminary data further showed that bacteria and their derivatives robustly enhanced the release of exosomes. Interestingly, many secreted miR-15a/16 were released via exosome-shuttled manner (preliminary data). We therefore propose to develop miR-15a/16 inhibitor-enriched exosomes and hypothesize that these miR-15a/16 inhibitor-enriched exosomes can significantly enhance phagocyte-mediated bacterial clearance and improve the outcomes after bacterial infection. This high-risk/high-reward approach is fundamentally different from traditional microbicidal strategies that target the bacteria themselves, and is expected to be highly complementary with direct antibiotic approaches.     R21 phase aims are to confirm the effect of miR-15a/16 deficiency on the clearance of antibiotic-resistant bacteria and to generate the miR-15a/16 inhibitor-enriched exosomes     R33 phase aims are: to characterize the uptake of miR-15a/16 inhibitor-enriched exosomes by phagocytes in vivo and to assess the toxicity and inflammatory effects of miR-15a/16 inhibitor-enriched exosomes."
"9390957","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The plasma level of apolipoprotein B100 (apoB100) is among the strongest risk factors for coronary artery disease, making the regulation of its production by the liver a significant pursuit. We and others have shown that apoB100 production by the liver is regulated primarily by post-translational degradation, with 2 major intracellular proteolytic systems involved, namely the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (UPP) when lipid ligands in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) for apoB100 are limiting, and autophagy, when hepatic cells are incubated with dietary n-3 fatty acids (FAs). In this proposal, we plan to establish the mechanisms and sites of action for chaperone-like holdases and for regulators of the Sec61 translocation channel that regulate apoB degradation by the UPP (Aim 1). Under Aim 2, we propose to pursue promising preliminary data to test in vitro and in vivo the hypotheses that autophagy, in addition to its role in n-3 FA-stimulated degradation, also is a regulator of apoB100 degradation under basal metabolic conditions, as well as under conditions relevant to obesity and insulin resistance (e.g., chronic exposure to high levels of common dietary FAs, and insulin- stimulated apoB100 degradation). Because apoB-lipid bodies form in hepatic cells in some of the metabolic settings under study, including, as we show, in human primary heptocytes, we will monitor their formation and turnover and seek their relationship to apoB100 degradation by the proteasome and autophagy. Under Aim 3, we plan to focus on the role of the over-expression of sortilin 1 (sort 1) in directing apoB100 to degradation in hepatic cells, based not only on its establishment in GWAS studies that hepatic over-expression of sort1 is asssociated with decreased plasma levels of LDL and apoB, but also on strong supporting data showing that its effects are dependent on autophagy. These studies will be conducted in vitro (including in primary human hepatocytes as warranted) and in vivo, using novel mouse models, and will examine the role and cell biological mechanisms by which sort1 participates in the autophagic degradation of apoB100 autophagy."
"9403204","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Heart failure (HF), a leading cause of mortality in patients with myocardial infarction (MI), is especially progressive in the 20-25% of post-MI patients with ischemic mitral regurgitation (IMR). IMR drives a vicious cycle of left ventricular (LV) dilatation and MR caused by leaflet tethering to the LV walls. Ongoing remodeling drive leads to frequent failure of standard annuloplasty ring therapy, indicating the need to treat the ventricle as well as the valve. Our prior work has shown that post-MI LV remodeling is exacerbated by the added MR-induced volume overload, with downregulation of SERCA2a, a key calcium cycling pump, and increased fibrosis. Upregulating SERCA2a with intracoronary adeno associated virus (AAV) reduces remodeling when given early and also with late MR repair. Fibrosis can be reduced by AAV.CCN5, which reverses functional deterioration in HF induced by pressure overload. This proposal considers two clinical scenarios: acute MI, with potential to limit early remodeling as stimulus for progressive remodeling and IMR; and later remodeling, to improve long- term results from surgical repair of IMR by addressing myocardial remodeling as well. The central hypothesis is that LV remodeling in an IMI-induced model of progressive heart failure with IMR can be reduced at both early and late stages through a synergistic approach improving both myocardial and interstitial components of heart failure. We will test the following hypotheses: 1) Early administration of SERCA2a, CCN5 or both at the time of ischemia-reperfusion injury can prevent the remodeling that occurs despite revascularization. This is supported by recent evidence for transgene uptake in this context, and by our preliminary evidence that early preventive therapy with the combined vectors safely reduces both local infarct deformation and the ensuing cycle of MR and global remodeling. This aim simulates the scenario of patients with acute MI undergoing primary percutaneous intervention (PCI). 2) Upregulating SERCA2a, CCN5 or both can prevent or reverse remodeling in an established inferior MI model that produces important MR, simulating the clinical situation of treatment after remodeling has occurred, either early or late relative to compensatory pathway activation or exhaustion. 3) SERCA2a, CCN5 or both can prevent ongoing remodeling leading to recurrent MR when given during annuloplasty repair in an inferior MI model. LV remodeling and MR will be compared for ring alone, myocardial therapy alone (Aim 2), and the combination. In these aims we will address mechanistic hypotheses regarding CCN5 inhibition of fibrosis by decreasing post-MI endothelial-to-mesenchymal cell transformation and pro- fibrotic myofibroblast formation; SERCA2a reduction of remodeling by increasing contractility and decreasing apoptosis; and reduction of localized infarct deformation by early therapy in addition to reduced progression of global remodeling. The collaborative team combines strengths in surgical physiologic modeling, imaging and pathology of fibrosis, and myocardial biology with gene therapy. Results can support clinical studies of these strategies in patients undergoing mitral valve repair for ischemic MR and primary PCI for acute MI."
"9421607","Nitro-fatty acids are endogenous adaptive signaling mediators detected in animal and human urine, and plasma under basal conditions. Dietary supplementation with conjugated linoleic acid and nitrite/nitrate leads to gastric nitration and increased systemic and urinary levels. Moreover, in mice and rats, tissue levels are found to be elevated not only by gastric formation, but also by mitochondria driven in situ formation. Nitro fatty acids are pleiotropic signaling modulators that have demonstrated protective effects in a variety of pathological conditions including acute and chronic kidney disease, hypertension, heart and kidney ischemia reperfusion, sepsis, metabolic syndrome, diabetes and pulmonary hypertension amongst others. These modified fatty acids are electrophilic and exert their signaling actions by reacting with target proteins to activate Nrf2 and heat shock protein expression, inhibit NF-?B inflammatory signaling and associated fibrotic events. Despite the recent advances nitro fatty acid pharmacology, highly promising preclinical animal model data and undergoing clinical trials, our understanding of formation, absorption, distribution and protein targets is lagging behind. The main reasons for this slow pace were technical challenges associated with analyzing and characterizing biochemical aspects of this reactive species. Based on new evidence, we hypothesize that free NO2-CLA in plasma and tissues is a minor component of the total endogenous pool, represented by glycerol esterified and protein bound forms. These lipid and protein pools are dynamic, bioavailable and dictate transport, storage, signaling and metabolism. To demonstrate this hypothesis, the following Specific Aims are proposed: Aim #1 Define the gastric formation, intestinal absorption and lipoprotein-dependent systemic distribution of NO2-CLA. Aim #2 Evaluate the role of proteins on NO2-CLA transport, storage, plasma and tissue levels. Aim #3 Establish the cardiac tissue distribution of exogenous and endogenous NO2-CLA and its functional protein targets in a rodent model of heart ischemia reperfusion. Overall, this proposal will provide quantitative information on NO2-CLA formation, mechanism of absorption and transport, spatial distribution and protein targets. The findings will directly impact not only the ongoing clinical programs but also how we understand the pharmacology of dietary electrophilic fatty acids."
"9390786","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this project is to understand the mechanisms by which mutations in the Inverted Formin 2 gene INF2 cause focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) in humans. We and others have identified numerous FSGS-segregating mutations, demonstrating that INF2 mutations are the most common autosomal dominant form of FSGS. INF2 is unique for a formin family member in that it accelerates both actin polymerization and depolymerization. Formins autoinhibit their activity by an interaction between two domains, the N-terminal DID (diaphanous inhibitory domain) and the C-terminal DAD (diaphanous autoregulatory domain), and are generally activated by binding of a small GTPase to the N-terminus near the DID. INF2 has two major splice variants, one associated with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) via a C-terminal prenyl group, and another lacking the prenyl group. In the first period of this grant, we have made significant progress towards understanding how mutations in INF2 cause human kidney disease. We have defined roles for INF2 in cells and organelles. We have shown that INF2 binds to and modulates the activity of the diaphanous formin (Dia) family of RhoA effectors. We have developed mouse and zebrafish models for the in vivo study of INF2 and its associated mutations. In contrast to essentially all other actin regulatory proteins, INF2-DID mutations are a relatively common form of human FSGS, suggesting that INF2-DID possesses unique and non-redundant functions in the podocyte. Our long-term goal is to understand these functions and, ultimately, exploit them for therapeutic benefit. Now, we aim to: (1) Define the specific biochemical effects of representative disease-causing mutants. We will test the hypothesis that the 30+ known INF2 mutations can each lead to disease through four possible defects: 1. Destabilization of INF2 protein structure, leading to instability/degradation; 2. Disruption of auto- inhibition of INF2 through the DID/DAD interaction; 3. Altered regulation of Dia family formins through interaction of INF2-DID with Dia-DAD; 4. Disruption of other inter-molecular interactions. (2) Define the effects of FSGS mutations on INF2 cellular function. We will: 1. Define INF2 and Dia protein localization and isoform expression in podocytes; 2. Determine cellular effects of FSGS mutations on INF2 and Dia function; 3. Assess the influence of Dia proteins on FSGS mutant effects (3) Correlate in vitro and cell-based studies with in vivo models (zebrafish, mouse). We will: 1. Use a zebrafish INF2 knockdown model to compare the direct phenotypic effects of a range of different perturbations in INF2 (knockdown, transgenesis) in response to changes in RhoA/Rac/Cdc42 signaling; 2. Use the results from these studies to guide experiments in mouse point mutant (knockin) and knockout models, investigating the molecular mechanisms of injury in a mammalian kidney."
"9386064","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Allergic diseases affect an increasing number of people in the United States and worldwide. Among these diseases, allergic asthma is particularly concerning because of its high morbidity and financial burden. While medical science has made profound advances in the treatment of asthma symptoms, a true cure for the disease remains elusive. Many researchers seeking a cure for asthma have focused their attention on the immune system. In asthma, the immune system reacts inappropriately to common, harmless products (allergens) in the environment, such as house dust mite (HDM). Normal individuals do not experience an immune response when encountering such allergens and are said to be tolerant to the allergen. However, asthma suffers lack this tolerance and experience a damaging inflammatory response. Understanding how tolerance develops and why it is lacking in asthma is critical for development of a true cure. The immune system possesses regulatory elements that help control immune responses. Previous work has shown that one of these, the regulatory T cell (Treg), plays a key role in the establishment of tolerance to allergens. However, the mechanisms by which Tregs are generated and prevent asthma in healthy people remains unknown. One possible influence on the immune system is the microbiome, the community of microorganisms that live on and within each of us. Over the past decade, researchers have discovered that the microbiome can exert regulatory effects on the immune system, including induction of Tregs. Many studies have shown that loss or disruption of the microbiome promotes allergy and asthma; thus, the microbiome may have a key influence on tolerance development. This proposal hypothesizes that the microbiome promotes tolerance to allergens like house dust mite (HDM) through promotion of Treg formation. The overall goal of this proposal is to determine the effect of HDM exposure on the microbiome and the relationship of the microbiome to allergic disease and tolerance. Overall Impact: Completion of the proposed aims may reveal new opportunities for microbiome-based therapies that could provide curative treatments for asthma."
"9472091","Limitless replicative potential is a key hallmark of cancer and critically depends on telomere maintenance. Many cancers thus aberrantly reactivate the telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT), a catalytic subunit of the telomerase complex that elongates telomere. It has been recently discovered that this common path to immortality in multiple cancers is through two activating point mutations in the TERT promoter (TERTp), found in more than 50 different cancer types, often at strikingly high frequencies, e.g. roughly 83% in glioblastomas (GBM) and 71% in melanomas. In the previous funding period, the PI has identified the molecular function of these highly recurrent mutations, demonstrating that the transcription factor (TF) GABP binds the mutant TERTp with exquisite specificity, but not the wild-type TERTp. The high prevalence of TERTp mutations across multiple cancer types and the selectivity of GABP recruitment to mutant TERTp thus provide an unprecedented opportunity for treating a large number of cancer patients with minimal toxicity to healthy cells. Despite the clear significance of this opportunity, however, several important questions surrounding the molecular functions and modulators of TERTp mutations remain poorly understood, hindering the development of effective and safe therapeutic strategies.  Our long-term goal is to establish a rigorous computational framework for understanding the aberrant transcriptional and epigenetic networks in cancers and to apply the resulting knowledge to devise novel therapeutic strategies that account for the genetic background of individual patients and that can a priori predict and avoid potential resistance mechanisms. The objective of our current renewal proposal is to develop powerful computational methods for transforming our knowledge about the non-coding TERTp mutations into an effective and safe molecular target. At the same time, the resulting methods will help resolve several outstanding challenges in the field of transcriptional gene regulation and have broad applications in cancer genomics. We will accomplish our objective my pursuing the following Aims: (1) Develop and test a computational framework for inferring sequence features that determine the distinct and shared binding patterns of paralogous TFs; (2) Develop and validate integrative tools for discovering the molecular basis of genetic interactions between germline variations and oncogenic mutations; (3) Develop and apply computational methods for studying the role of DNA helical phase between adjacent binding motifs in recruiting ETS factors to chromatin; (4) Perform a systematic genomic characterization of the effects of knocking out GABPB1L in TERTp-mutant cancer cells and healthy cells. The results of this proposal will have a broad impact on cancer research by providing powerful tools for studying paralogous oncogenic TFs and revealing novel insights into a highly promising therapeutic strategy."
"9456055","PROJECT SUMMARY Molecular imaging has been a dream of biomedical imaging scientists for decades, and governments and industries around the world have invested billions in this area. However, most existing molecular imaging techniques require exogenous molecular probes or reporters to be introduced into a subject in order to obtain molecule-specific information, thereby limiting their practical utility. Magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) has long been recognized as a potentially powerful tool for non-invasive, label-free molecular imaging. Proton (1H) MRSI, in particular, allows for the observation, identification and quantification of a large number of biologically important molecules (neurotransmitters and metabolites), and provides a unique capability to study brain metabolism and neurodegenerative diseases. However, clinical and research applications of 1H-MRSI have been developing very slowly due to several long-standing technical barriers, including long data acquisition time, poor spatial resolution, low signal-to-noise (SNR), and overwhelming nuisance signals. The primary objective of the proposed project is to bring a new MRSI technology, known as SPectroscopic Imaging by exploiting spatiospectral CorrElation (SPICE), into practical use for rapid high-resolution metabolic imaging of the brain. SPICE is based on a new approach to MRSI, which contains several key innovative features, including combined ultrashort-TE/short-TR acquisitions without water and lipid suppression, rapid sampling of (k, t)-space, constrained image reconstruction, and statistical spectral quantification using both physics-based spectral bases and spatial constraints. Our preliminary results have shown an exciting potential of SPICE to achieve an unprecedented combination of resolution, speed, and SNR for MRSI. This project will further develop and optimize SPICE data acquisition and processing and validate its performance to lay a solid foundation for clinical investigation. We believe that SPICE, when fully developed, will transform noninvasive, label- free metabolic imaging of the brain."
"9410569","The Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) is common, costly, and responsible for high mortality and long-term morbidity. An estimated 200,000 Americans develop ARDS each year, of which more than 74,000 die from the disease. There is a significant unmet clinical need both for early rapid detection and diagnosis as well as clinical trajectory monitoring of ARDS. Current methods of detection include various scoring systems that have unacceptably low positive predictive values, and tools such as chest radiographs and gas exchange metrics, which temporally lag the acute, dynamic inflammatory processes responsible for ARDS. This prevents early recognition and treatment of ARDS, resulting in increased mortality. Exhaled breath contains volatile organic (VOCs) that could potentially be used noninvasively to predict the onset and severity of various diseases and to guide therapy. Real-time monitoring of VOCs could produce point-of-care (POC) breathomic signatures capable of rapidly detecting lung and systemic disease processes such as ARDS and sepsis. Such POC monitoring of lung and systemic metabolomics could prove transformative in managing the dynamic physiology in critical care and emergency medicine. Unfortunately, no vapor analyzer exists to detect these exhaled biomarkers with the part-per-billion (ppb) sensitivity and rapid response time necessary to allow for POC testing. This project proposes to develop a portable, fully automated, high-performance multi-dimensional micro-gas chromatography (GC) device that can be attached to a mechanical ventilator and is capable of rapidly and continuously detecting exhaled VOCs specific to ARDS. Our objectives are to identify breathomic patterns for the early detection, stratification, and trajectory monitoring of ARDS. In this project, we propose 2 specific aims: Aim 1: Refine the GC device and expand VOC targets. We will refine and evolve our current 1x4-channel 2- dimensional (2-D) GC device to a 1x2x4-channel 3-D device capable of detecting and quantifying additional important inflammation related VOCs. A 3-D VOC reference library will be created for in-situ analyte identification and quantitation. Aim 2: Identify exhaled breath biomarkers related to the onset, severity, and resolution of ARDS. Under IRB approval, we will use the portable GC to study mechanically ventilated patients with and without ARDS in a time series manner to collect GC, physiologic, and demographic data allowing for detection and analysis of breathomic signatures associated with the onset, severity, and trajectory of ARDS.  The potential to identify breathomic patterns used for early diagnosis, disease trajectory tracking, and outcome prediction monitoring of ARDS would have significant impact on changing practice and improving patient outcomes. The same device and methods developed in the proposed project can also be extended to other diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and pneumonia, and to other clinical settings outside of the intensive care unit."
"9457827","Abstract Cystic Fibrosis (CF) is a common lethal autosomal recessive disorder, occurring in 1 per 2,500 to 3,500 U.S. births annually. The disease is caused by defects in the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR). Mutations that change the CFTR coding sequence alter integrity of peptide folding and lead to disease. In this project, we show that CFTR codon alterations?including both non-synonymous and synonymous polymorphisms on background of the common F508del variant?can perturb ribosome dynamics, consequent mRNA utilization, translational rate, and protein biogenesis. The critical relationship between protein folding and translational velocity is a topical area with ramifications ranging from basic CFTR trafficking to disease phenotype and intervention. Mechanistic underpinnings for this application are derived from genome-wide phenomic screening with the Saccharomyces cerevisiae deletion strain library to identify novel modulators of F508del CFTR maturation, leading to discovery of specific ribosomal protein modules that impact F508del CFTR folding. We have established that suppression of Rpl12, along with other 60S proteins comprising the ribosomal stalk, improve F508del CFTR processing and activity at the mammalian cell surface to levels (in primary airway epithelia) predicted to confer clinical benefit among CF patients and comparable in magnitude to lumacaftor, a new agent recently approved for this purpose. Our preliminary data indicate that improved folding and activity of F508del CFTR are attributable to effects on translational kinetics. We propose three Specific Aims to develop an innovative model relevant to CF pathogenesis: 1) Define ribosomal domains and functional pathway interactions that govern ?F protein biogenesis, and expand the analysis to include other CFTR variants and complex alleles, 2) Ascertain the mechanism by which Rpl12 suppression rescues F508del CFTR function, including relevance of translation rate to disease causing CF mutations and other CFTR polymorphisms, 3) Determine in vivo significance by development of RPL12 conditional knockout or haplosufficient mice. Our team combines multidisciplinary and mutually reinforcing expertise in CFTR biochemistry, transport physiology, ribosome profiling, translational velocity, yeast phenomics, and molecular genetics to mechanistically address a fundamental hypothesis regarding ways the ribosome utilizes mRNA to influence folding and functional quality of resulting gene products. We will establish translation control as a novel and critical mediator of Yor1 and CFTR maturation, identify specific ribosome modules that influence the CFTR biogenesis pathway, and evaluate relevance and safety of repressing this target in a murine disease model. Such results will improve understanding of CF molecular mechanism, suggest novel approaches for personalized treatment of CF patients with the most common forms of the disease, and indicate clinical significance of an important new observation relevant to aberrant protein translation and a fatal genetic illness."
"9470108","Project Summary/Abstract Although fetal alcohol syndrome was discovered over forty years ago and is entirely preventable, the incidence of fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) has not diminished. The type and severity of alcohol-induced alterations following prenatal alcohol exposure is strongly impacted by genetics. Dr. Kristin Hamre has demonstrated in BXD recombinant inbred mouse strains with differential vulnerability to FASD that genetics is a principal factor defining susceptibility to alcohol-induced neuron death in the fetal hippocampus, one of the regions central to FASD cognitive deficits. However, the mechanisms behind the genetic contribution has not been identified. Research by Dr. Cynthia Kane has shown that alcohol exposure in the developing brain of C57BL/6J (B6) mice (a parental strain of the BXD lines) produces neuroinflammatory responses that lead to neuron death, including production of pro-inflammatory molecules and glial activation in the hippocampus. Her lab has also found that administration of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-y agonist, pioglitazone, reduces alcohol-induced neuroinflammatory responses in the developing central nervous system. However, the role of genetics in neuroinflammatory responses to developmental alcohol exposure has not been determined. We hypothesize that differential fetal vulnerability to FASD is mediated, at least in part, by genetic differences leading to variation in the neuroinflammatory response to alcohol in the developing hippocampus. Experiments outlined in this proposal will: 1) determine whether alcohol-induced neuroinflammatory responses contribute to the differential genetic vulnerability to alcohol-induced cell loss in the developing hippocampus in Specific Aim 1 and 2) investigate whether administration of the anti-inflammatory drug, pioglitazone, protects highly sensitive BXD strains from hippocampal cell loss by suppressing alcohol-induced neuroinflammatory responses in neonatal mice in Specific Aim 2. The effects will be determined by examining expression of mRNA, expression of protein, percentage of cell loss, and activation of microglia and astrocytes in the hippocampus of neonatal mice exposed to developmental alcohol. This research will result in a further understanding of 1) the genetic contributions to the severity of FASD, 2) the genetic influence of alcohol-induced neuroinflammatory responses, and 3) whether pioglitazone is equally effective at inhibiting alcohol-induced cell loss across animals of differing genetic backgrounds."
"9390486","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application seeks to improve basic understanding of the molecular mechanisms that mediate cytoprotective actions of coagulation proteases on cells. Available therapeutic solutions for vascular, thrombotic, and inflammatory diseases are limited and mortality rates remain unacceptably high. Activated protein C (APC) has beneficial effects of in a broad spectrum of injury and disease models where ischemia and inflammation contribute to pathogenesis. The cytoprotective activities of APC are responsible for these beneficial effects of APC in vivo and involve the endothelial protein C receptor (EPCR), protease activated receptor (PAR) 1, and PAR3. The cytoprotective effects of APC on cells contrast with proinflammatory effects of other coagulation proteases (e.g. thrombin) on cells and initiated novel perspectives on how the same receptor (PAR1) can mediate such different opposing effects. The EPCR-dependent non-canonical activation of PAR1 at Arg46 and PAR3 at Arg41 are newly discovered mechanisms of biased PAR signaling. The functional selectivity of thrombin versus APC is thus determined by the proteolytic activation sites in PAR1 and PAR3 that give rise to the new N-terminal tethered-ligands. The immediate goal of this application is to gain novel insights into the molecular mechanisms of non-canonical biased PAR signaling and the extent to which the canonical/non-canonical PAR profile determines the functional selectivity of proteases. Major focus will be on structure-function studies of PAR3 non-canonical signaling mechanisms and of PAR canonical/non- canonical proteolysis profiles of coagulation proteases. Furthermore, several conceptual key aspects of the non-canonical PAR activation and biased signaling paradigm will be tested in vitro and in vivo using engineered EPCR variants that are expected to augment cytoprotective mechanisms. The long-term objectives of this application are to contribute to diagnostic and therapeutic progress for vascular, thrombotic, and inflammatory diseases by advancing knowledge through both basic and translational research. Novel hypotheses will be tested using biochemical and cellular biology methods and validated by studies in mouse models in vivo. The specific aims are: 1) To characterize the structure-activity-function determinants for EPCR- dependent non-canonical PAR1 and PAR3 activation, and 2) To provide proof-of-concept for optimized engineered EPCR variants with improved characteristics. Successful completion of the proposed studies will increase our knowledge and understanding of vascular, thrombotic, and inflammatory diseases and may provide a platform for the development of novel therapeutic strategies for a variety of disorders in which thrombosis, apoptosis and inflammation contribute to pathogenesis."
"9464811","Project Summary  Among the commercially available systems for single cell isolation and next generation sequencing (NGS) sample preparation, none are capable of automating both imaging and NGS sample preparation at high throughput. While single cell genomic analysis has improved in sensitivity and throughput, concomitant improvements in detailed phenotypic characterization of cells has not been integrated into automated workflows, nor have they been scaled beyond a few dozen cells per run. Currently, the only means of biomarker- based sorting of cells prior to single cell sequencing is either fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) or imaging cells on a microscope which is separate from an automated sample preparation instrument (e.g. Fluidigm C1, WaferGen ICELL8). For example, 10X Genomics? technology relies on upfront FACS purification of cell populations, and still cannot connect these relatively superficial phenotypic observations to downstream NGS data. Fluidigm?s C1 system allows imaging of the approximately 800 cells loaded on a microfluidic device on a separate microscope, but this method results in significant rates of multiplets and requires investigators to construct their own imaging methods, equipment and software, independent of the C1 system. Fluidigm?s Polaris allows both imaging and NGS sample preparation in one instrument but is limited in throughput to 48 cells per run and represents a significant capital expense. To address the unmet need for integrated imaging and NGS sample preparation in a single, high-throughput, cost-effective system, Cell Microsystems proposes here the development of the AIR-FLOW? System. Using our core CellRaft Technology, the AIR-FLOW? will allow multi-channel fluorescent imaging, isolation of single cells and RNA-Seq library preparation. The AIR-FLOW? System will allow multi-channel automated imaging of surface markers, morphology and even subcellular features, while integrating a microfluidic sample preparation method developed by Peter Sims, PhD of Columbia University to construct next generation sequencing (NGS) transcriptomic libraries. Dr. Sims? sample preparation technology is highly complementary with the CellRaft technology: both rely on microwell arrays, fluorescence imaging and the same biocompatible materials. This approach employs optically barcoded beads for mRNA capture and sample preparation, allowing the resulting sequencing data to be directly linked to imaging data on a cell-to-cell basis. Also, by integrating these two technologies, throughputs of several thousand cells per 4-5 hr run will be easily achievable. Based on our Phase I data, Cell Microsystems? core CellRaft Technology, provides key advantages over existing microfluidic technologies, effectively eliminating cell-to-cell cross-contamination, reducing sample input requirements and providing a less stressful environment which reduces transcriptomic artifacts. During this Phase II program, we will integrate Dr. Sims? technology with the core CellRaft Technology in the AIR-FLOW? System."

"9378723","?     DESCRIPTION: (provided by applicant)          Military Veterans suffering from posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) have been shown to exhibit increases in anger and aggressive behavior. Dysregulated anger and aggression can create fear and distress in spouses, family members, and friends resulting in deteriorated relationships, and can have a detrimental impact on Veterans' social, occupational and other important areas of functioning. Standard Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)-based interventions for anger and aggression are limited in part because they do not directly target the specific PTSD symptoms most strongly associated with aggression, namely increased hyperarousal and physiological reactivity. Further, they do not assist individuals in achieving awareness and insight into their anger states, which is necessary for effective management of anger and aggression. Mindfulness involves the self-regulation of attention on one's immediate experience and adopting an orientation of acceptance toward one's present experiences. Research studies conducted with civilians have found mindfulness to be effective in reducing anger and aggression. To date, no research has examined the effectiveness of mindfulness in decreasing anger and aggression among Veterans with PTSD. The proposed study aims to examine the initial efficacy of an established mindfulness intervention, Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) in decreasing trauma-related anger and aggression in Veterans with PTSD. The proposed project also aims to examine potential mechanisms of action accounting for its effects. Dr. Kachadourian is a postdoctoral fellow in the Clinical Neurosciences Division o the National Center for PTSD at the West Haven VA who has conducted basic research on alcohol, PTSD, anger, and aggression. Her current interests include conducting clinical trials to test novel therapeutic approaches like mindfulness meditation in treating anger and aggression among military Veterans with PTSD. TRAINING GOALS: The objectives for this CDA-2 application include advancing Dr. Kachadourian's expertise in conducting clinical trial research and advanced statistical analyses, and increasing her proficiency in mindfulness interventions. This will be accomplished through a rigorous program of formal didactics, collaboration with researchers experienced in clinical trials research and in mindfulness, PTSD, anger, and aggression, and a randomized controlled pilot study examining the initial efficacy of MBSR in decreasing anger and aggression among Veterans with PTSD. METHODS: Sixty Veterans with PTSD experiencing problems with anger and aggression will be randomly assigned to participate in a PTSD psychoeducational course (Trauma Recovery Education Class or TREC) or MBSR. All participants will attend a baseline, post-treatment, and 3-month follow-up session to assess changes in self-reported anger and aggression over time. At the post-treatment session, participants will also engage in a trauma-imagery procedure using trauma narratives developed at the baseline session. They then will participate in a laboratory paradigm designed to assess provoked aggression. In addition to examining whether participation in MBSR decreases self-reported levels of anger and aggression, this study will examine whether MBSR decreases aggression in participants after being exposed to trauma reminders in vivo. The extent to which mindfulness reduces physiological reactivity and increases emotion regulation will also be examined. The key question in this study is whether mindfulness decreases anger and aggression in Veterans with PTSD. Through this award, Dr. Kachadourian will be able to achieve her long-term goal of becoming an independent VA scientist with expertise in testing novel clinical interventions to treat problematic anger and aggression in military Veterans with PTSD."

"9446480","ABSTRACT: Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome (HPS) is a rare form of pulmonary fibrosis that results from mutations in genes that regulate the function of lysosomes and lysosomal-related organelles. Although mutations in the alveolar epithelium have been linked to the development of HPS lung fibrosis, the mechanisms by which these mutations enhance susceptibility of the lung to injury are unknown. In recent work, we uncovered a novel mechanism by which epithelial-specific HPS mutations promote fibrotic remodeling in the lung. We have found that deficiency in the AP3 protein (a known HPS gene) leads to marked reduction in expression of p53 in the alveolar epithelium by increasing ubiquitin-proteasome degradation of this protein. Further, we uncovered that expression of p53 is essential for regulating antioxidant and barrier defenses in the lung epithelium and we also found that strategies which increase p53 expression can effectively restore epithelial homeostasis and reduce fibrotic remodeling in the lungs of bleomycin-exposed AP3 deficient mice. Based on these observations, we propose the following central hypothesis regarding the pathogenesis of pulmonary fibrosis in HPS: We hypothesize that AP3 deficiency enhances susceptibility to pulmonary fibrosis by decreasing p53 expression in the distal lung epithelium, and strategies that augment p53 expression can both attenuate lung injury and reduce fibrotic remodeling to bleomycin in the HPS mouse lung. This central hypothesis will be tested in 3 Specific Aims. In Specific Aim 1, we will test the hypothesis that AP3 deficiency reduces p53 expression by enhancing ubiquitin-proteasome degradation. We will determine whether genetic and pharmacological approaches that block the degradation of p53 enhance antioxidant and epithelial barrier defenses and reduce fibrotic remodeling in the bleomycin-exposed lung. In Specific Aim 2, we will confirm that expression of p53 is critically important in maintaining antioxidant and barrier defenses in the lung by performing various in vitro and in vivo loss- and gain-of-function studies in wild-type and AP3 deficient injured and uninjured tissues. Lastly, in Specific Aim 3, we will test the hypothesis that decreased macroautophagy in the alveolar epithelium of AP3 deficient mice contributes to accumulation of the ubiquitin ligases which target p53 for degradation. We will further test whether strategies augmenting macroautophagy can reduce p53 degradation, augment anti-oxidant and epithelial barrier defenses and ameliorate bleomycin-induced fibrotic remodeling in the lung. In summary, this proposal will establish the mechanisms by which AP3 deficiency enhances susceptibility to pulmonary injury/fibrosis and lay the foundation for future clinical investigations testing whether therapeutic strategies targeting these mechanisms can attenuate the onset or progression of pulmonary fibrosis in HPS."
"9393542","Project Summary: Corticostriatal processing of alcohol-paired cues in aversion-resistant drinking (CAPD) Treatment resistant alcoholism is characterized by a loss of control over drinking where individuals persistently use in spite of negative consequences. Currently approved treatments for alcoholism (e.g. disulfiram) aim to reduce drinking by making alcohol consumption aversive. However, this approach is problematic as the hedonic properties of alcohol may no longer motivate drinking behavior in advanced stages of the disease. Rather, when drinking has advanced to a stage that is resistant to aversive consequences, the control of behavior is thought to transition from neural circuits that mediate higher cognitive functions to those that mediate compulsions and habits. Two prominent factors that influence the transition to this stage of drinking are history of alcohol use and genetic risk for alcohol abuse (e.g. family history). Preliminary data from Indiana Alcohol Research Center (IARC) investigators demonstrate that certain rodent models of genetic risk for excessive drinking also tend to quickly form habits and compulsive behaviors. Therefore, a critical need exists to understand how alcohol exposure and genetic factors influence the computational properties of brain regions necessary for the cognitive control of motivated behavior. The long-term goal of this project is to understand the heritable changes in neural computation that facilitate the transition to a loss of control over drinking. Following this transition, alcohol associated cues retain extreme incentive motivational properties even when associated with aversive consequences. A method commonly used to assess aversion resistant drinking (ARD) in rodents is measuring their willingness to consume alcohol adulterated with a bad taste - the quinine devaluation procedure. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that the genetic predisposition to allocate cognitive resources in a stimulus-dependent manner interacts with chronic alcohol use to facilitate ARD. Electrophysiological recordings will be obtained from the medial prefrontal cortex and ventral striatum of awake behaving alcohol preferring (P) and Wistars rats performing a Pavlovian cued access drinking procedure. This approach will allow the representation of alcohol-paired cues to be measured at the individual neuron and ensemble levels to determine how they are processed differently during ARD. Rigorous statistical procedures will be use to quantify the representation of alcohol-paired cues in corticostriatal circuits, and how they are influenced by alcohol history and genetic risk. Aim 1 will examine changes in the representation of alcohol-paired cues following alcohol exposure to determine if drinking history and genetic risk enhances the encoding of alcohol-paired cues in corticostriatal circuits. Aim 2 will determine if drinking history and genetic risk impair the ability of corticostriatal circuits to remap representations of alcohol-paired cues. Finally, Aim 3 will determine if drinking history and genetic risk enhance corticostriatal representations of alcohol-paired cues in Aversion-Resistant Drinking. These data will shed light on the changes in corticostriatal function that underlie ARD, and are therefore consistent with the overarching goals of the IARC."
"9389528","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Vascular smooth muscle cells (SMCs) are highly specialized cells that express high levels of SMC-specific proteins, such as smooth muscle myosin heavy chain (SMMHC/Myh11) and smooth muscle-?ctin (?A/Acta2)1. Under pathological conditions, however, SMCs are capable of undergoing profound phenotypic and functional changes resulting in a proliferative, inflammatory phenotype. An important paradigm shift in recent years suggests that vascular progenitor cells (VPCs) reside in a specialized niche within the adventitia of postnatal vessels. Adventitial VPCs express several stem cell markers, including Sca1 and CD34, have the capacity to differentiate in vitro into multiple lineages in response to specific signals, and potentially contribute to intimal lesions in vivo. However, important unanswered questions remain, including their origin, their degree of pluripotency and/or heterogeneity, and their contribution to vessel maintenance, repair, and pathological lesion formation. Using an innovative in vivo fate-mapping approach to genetically label mature Myh11- expressing SMC, we definitively established that mature SMCs give rise to the majority of intimal SMCs in response to wire-induced injury. Quite unexpectedly, we made the observation that some mature SMCs reverse migrate into the adventitia, exhibit no detectable expression of SM markers, but gain expression of Sca1 and CD34. We established that a distinct subpopulation of AdvSca1 progenitors arise from mature SMCs through a process we are calling endogenous adventitial reprogramming and suggest these cells play important roles in arterial homeostasis and disease. Our preliminary findings suggest SMC-derived AdvSca1 cells reside in the adventitia and contribute to a heterogeneic population of resident VPCs that possess distinct biological properties and fate decisions. Our overall hypothesis is that mature SMCs are reprogrammed during the later stages of vascular development to a subpopulation of functionally distinct VPCs; reprogramming is dependent at least in part on induction of the transcription factor, Klf4 and loss of the tumor suppressor, PTEN. After vascular injury, mobilization and recruitment of these cells contributes to intimal lesion formation and vessel repair. Our data could have a profound impact on defining the endogenous molecular mechanisms underlying the formation and maintenance of resident VPCs, which could lead to the potential to manipulate these cells in situ to improve therapeutic applications in settings suc as atherosclerosis/restenosis, aneurysm formation, ischemic tissues, and tumor angiogenesis. Mature macrovessel SMCs, as the source of resident VPCs, involving more than SMC dedifferentiation, but reprogramming to a functional progenitor phenotype, has not been described. Three Aims are proposed to define the differentiation potential and response of SMC- derived VPCs to vascular injury (Aim One), to define the role of Klf4 and PTEN on SMC reprogramming and identify essential endogenous pathways involved in SMC reprogramming (Aim Two), and define the in vivo fate and function of SMC-derived VPCs in response to vascular injury (Aim Three)."
"9448965","Project Summary/Abstract Traumatic brain injuries (TBI) frequently result in persisting post-traumatic neurological consequences, including hypersensitivity to light, with limited effective treatments. Vision is a primary sensory modality in humans, similar to whisker sensation in rodents. Primary sensory modalities incorporate a large portion of the brain for processing, making them susceptible to diffuse TBI. The goal of this proposal is to employ an experimental rodent model of diffuse TBI that highlights sensory deficits to evaluate delayed alterations in glutamate signaling as a universal consequence of TBI and its potential for modulation. Using this model in preliminary results the PI has demonstrated that TBI induces late-onset sensory hypersensitivity to whisker stimulation by post-injury day (PID) 28 that persists to PID 56. This injury-induced sensory hypersensitivity is measured using the established Whisker Nuisance Task (WNT), where whisker stimulation results in active evasion and aberrant responses in injured rats compared to ambivalence or curiosity in uninjured rats. Since the whisker circuit is glutamatergic, this research team implemented electrochemical microelectrode array technology, capable of real-time measurements of glutamate neurotransmission in vivo, for recordings within the relays of the whisker circuit in anesthetized rats. The PI reported that WNT scores positively correlate to the magnitude of potassium (KCl)-evoked glutamate release in the somatosensory thalamus and cortex. Evoked-glutamate release was sensitive to ?-conotoxin, indicating hypersensitive presynaptic glutamate release as a potential mechanism for whisker hypersensitivity. Also, 3D reconstruction of neuron morphology shows increased numbers of terminating dendrites within the thalamus at PID 28, providing a potential source for increased glutamate release. KCl-evoked glutamate responses are required in anesthetized studies since whisker stimulation-evoked glutamate responses are suppressed by anesthesia. Thus, real-time recordings of glutamate neurotransmission in the awake, freely-moving rat permits the evaluation of whisker stimulation- evoked glutamate responses during the WNT. This has led to the central hypotheses that TBI-induced sensory hypersensitivity arises from altered glutamate signaling in sensory circuits and that early rehabilitation will restore circuit function and alleviate behavioral symptoms. To test these hypotheses adult male and female rats will be subjected to diffuse TBI by midline fluid percussion and evaluated for: 1) the influence of sex on late-onset sensory hypersensitivity to whisker stimulation and glutamate neurotransmission; 2) whisker stimulated-evoked glutamate release in awake, freely-moving rats, with respect to time post-diffuse TBI, and 3) evidence that circuit-directed rehabilitation, focused on the whiskers, can mitigate hypersensitive glutamate release and concurrent behavioral sensory hypersensitivity. Impact: Coupling this model of circuit disruption with electrochemical recordings in awake, freely-moving rats allows for evaluation of glutamate signaling as a biomarker for injury-induced persisting neurological deficits for evaluation of therapeutic approaches."

Aberrant LPLA2 activity may also be involved in development of autoimmune disease and atherosclerosis. LPLA2 is 50% identical in sequence to lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT), a key enzyme in reverse cholesterol transport from arterial plaque macrophages via high density lipoproteins (HDL). Genetic mutations in LCAT are responsible for Familial LCAT Deficiency (FLD), a devastating disease characterized by low serum cholesterol ester levels and renal failure. There are no reported atomic models for either LPLA2 or LCAT, which do not have significant homology to other proteins of known structure. Thus, the molecular bases for their substrate selectivity, regulation, and disease phenotypes remain poorly understood. In this proposal, we address this critical gap in knowledge via functional analysis of our new 1.8 ? crystal structure of LPLA2, determination of the atomic structure of LCAT, imaging LCAT bound to HDL particles by electron microscopy, mapping somatic mutations known to cause genetic disease, and investigating the structural basis for differences in acyl acceptor selectivity. In support of our aims, we provide multiple high resolution structure of LPLA2 in various ligand states, negative stained images of LCAT-HDL complexes, and a low resolution crystal structure of fully glycosylated LCAT. The expected outcome of these studies is a better mechanistic understanding of a structurally uncharacterized family of eukaryotic enzymes that play key roles in lipid metabolism. Our structural and functional studies will help explain the molecular basis for genetic disease and ultimately assist in the design of improved biotherapeutics and small molecule LCAT activators to treat lipid-related disorders such as atherosclerosis and LCAT deficiency."
"9567649","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The long-term goal of this project is to develop novel targeted therapy for human pancreatic cancer (pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, PDA). PDA is a devastating disease with low survival rate and short survival time. The current systemic therapy has only marginal benefit to PDA patients. There is an urgent need for the development of effective and safe therapy for PDA. The loss of tumor suppressor (e.g., p53) and/or the overexpression of oncogenes (e.g., MDM2 and ß-catenin) have been linked to resistant to treatment and poor prognosis in PDA patients. The oncogene MDM2 is a negative regulator of p53 and has been suggested to be a valid molecular target for cancer therapy. Up to date, the majority of small molecule inhibitors (SMIs) of MDM2 have been designed to block the MDM2-p53 binding, reactivating the p53 function. However, the majority of PDA harbors mutant p53 and has high levels of MDM2; these MDM2 SMIs are expected to have low or no efficacy against PDA. Therefore, it is highly desirable to design novel MDM2 SMIs that have direct effects on MDM2 and exert their anticancer activity, independent of p53 status. Based on this new conceptual framework, the applicants have designed a series of novel, highly selective MDM2 SMIs, i.e. 1-aryl and 1- heteroaryl pyrido[b]indole derivatives and generated preliminary data to provide a basis for further development of the lead compounds as novel therapeutics for PDA treatment. These SMIs directly bind to MDM2, induce MDM2 degradation, inhibit cell growth, and induce apoptosis in PDA cells. One of the lead compounds, SP141, has significant in vitro activity, in vivo efficacy, and minimal host toxicity. When investigating its mechanisms o action, the applicants discovered a secondary target of SP141: inhibiting ß-catenin expression and its transactivation activity in PDA cells. In this proposal, the applicants will test the centrl hypothesis that SP141 is a novel effective and safe therapeutic agent for the treatment of human PDA and exerts its anti-PDA activity through targeting both MDM2 and ß-catenin. Four hypothesis-driven specific aims are proposed: 1) to demonstrate the in vivo efficacy of SP141 in various PDA models, including orthotopic, transgenic, and primary tumor-derived models; 2) to demonstrate that targeting MDM2 is the major mechanism of action for SP141-mediated anti-PDA activity; 3) to elucidate the role of ß-catenin inhibition in SP141- mediated anticancer activity; and 4) to characterize the pharmacological and toxicological properties of SP141 in PDA-relevant models. Upon completion of these proposed studies, the anticipated results will provide information on the therapeutic efficacy and safety of SP141 and the validation of the novel drug design strategy of targeting both MDM2 and ß-catenin in PDA. It is expected that this project will generate in a novel clinical candidate for PDA therapy, which would have a major impact on patient care and public health and that the mechanistic studies will shed more lights on the role of MDM2 and ß-catenin in PDA development, progression, and therapy."

"9398144","Abstract  In mammals, fetal cardiac myocytes (CMs) proliferate robustly, contributing to the growth of the heart in utero. Postnatally, cell cycle genes are dramatically down-regulated and the ability of CMs to enter the cell cycle is lost after postnatal day 7. The lack of cell cycle gene expression in adult CMs (ACMs) suggests these genes are stably silenced and no longer able to respond to growth stimuli. As a result of this very limited proliferative potential, the mammalian heart has long been thought of as a non-regenerative organ. This has been challenged by increasing evidence demonstrating that postnatal CMs do proliferate and contribute to myocardial renewal but at a very low rate. The lack of cell cycle gene expression in ACMs is reminiscent of other biologic processes such as senescence or cell cycle checkpoints where epigenetic mechanisms stably silence gene transcription through the formation of heterochromatin. This proposal hypothesizes that cell cycle genes are stably silenced in ACMs through a highly regulated process that involves trimethylation of histone H3 on lysine 9 (H3K9me3), which then recruits the epigenetic machinery at cell cycle promoters leading to stable gene silencing. The corollary of this model, if true, is that manipulating this epigenetic process and the proteins that mediate heterochromatin formation could promote cell cycle re-entry in ACMs, a first step towards cardiac proliferation and myocardial regeneration.

In addition, the Core houses and genotypes mice,  backcrosses mice onto inbred strains, maintains animal protocols, and organizes histological studies on  mouse models.  The Core also produces purified proteins for biochemical studies and for generating polyclonal and  monoclonal antibodies; this has been an essential function, since our PPG has focused on newly discovered  molecules, for which few reagents exist. During the prior funding period, Drs. Bensadoun, Fong and Young  produced multiple antibody reagents for this PPG.

"9388977","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We have shown that inhibition of Notch signaling leads to regeneration of hair cells and provide partial functional recovery in the adult ear with hair cells damaged by noise-exposure. We have recently discovered that Wnt signaling provides a required stimulus for pushing both embryonic progenitor cells and adult stem cells to a hair cell fate. Wnt signaling is necessary for induction of Atoh1 in cells exposed to Notch inhibition, as demonstrated by an absence of Atoh1 upregulation when Wnt signaling is blocked. This suggests that Wnt signaling is required for hair cell differentiation in the cochlea in response to Notch inhibition. Similar to Notch inhibition, gene expression controlled by Wnt stimulates hair cell dfiferentiation, but it also appears to stimulate genes that lead to the replacement of supporting cells. One of these downstream targets, Lgr5, appears to mark cochlear progenitors capable of postnatal transdifferentiation into new hair cells. Our current knowledge of signaling pathways, and our development of the models needed for their manipulation allow a crucial series of experiments to test hypotheses on the nature of the signaling pathways required to elicit hair cell regeneration and recovery of function.  Although our recent work has provided an important proof-of-principle for hair cell replacement in the adult, regeneration was limited and the transdifferentiated supporting cells were not replaced. Here, we assess the response of both the newborn and adult cochlea to inhibition of Notch after hair cell damage. We hypothesize that Wnt signaling after hair cell death leads to a partial regenerative response in the newborn cochlea and that signaling through these pathways does not reach levels necessary to initiate regeneration in the adult cochlea. In Aim 1, we test our hypothesis about Wnt signaling in the newborn cochlea by both gain and loss of function studies for a role of Wnt in regeneration in response to Notch inhibition. In Aim 2 we test whether Notch inhibition or ?-catenin upregulation in the damaged cochlea in adults, where we can measure hair cell regeneration, is accompanied by gene expression changes characteristic of regeneration. In Aim 3, we test our hypothesis that forced activation of Wnt in combination with Notch inhibition will drive both supporting cell proliferation and transdifferentiation of new hair cells. We further test the idea that the regeneration we see after damage and inhibition of ?-secretase can only occur if Wnt signaling is active."
"9457110","Unlike sight, taste and smell, mechanical senses extend beyond a single sensory organ, and encompass processes as diverse as hearing, somatosensation, and interoception. Despite their physiological importance, the molecular identity of mechanotransduction channels is largely unknown. Our lab discovered the first vertebrate mechanically-gated cation channels, Piezo1 and Piezo2, and have shown that Piezo2 plays a critical role in detecting touch, proprioception and lung stretch, but not noxious mechanical stimuli. However, big questions remain: what other mechanosensory systems depend on Piezos, and what is the identity of the remaining noxious mechanosensors? We will explore the role of Piezo2 in various forms of internal-organ mechanotransduction (interoception), including satiety and baroreception - processes crucial for normal physiology and pathophysiology. Beyond Piezo2, unknown mechanosensors mediate the transduction of noxious mechanical forces leading to the perception of pain, and are anticipated to be important therapeutic targets. We will use high-throughput screens and functional genomics approaches to find these receptors. Identifying these elusive sensors will break open the pain field, as Piezo2 has done for touch."
"9394815","Project Summary  Transendothelial migration (TEM) of leukocytes is a critical step in the inflammatory response, since most of the damage due to unwanted inflammation occurs after leukocytes cross blood vessels. TEM is regulated by molecules such as platelet/endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 (PECAM, CD31) and CD99 expressed on both the leukocytes and at endothelial cell (EC) borders. On EC, these molecules also reside in an interconnected membrane reticulum of membrane called the lateral border recycling compartment (LBRC) that is ?targeted? to the site of TEM. Homophilic interactions between leukocyte PECAM and EC PECAM control the start of diapedesis. Homophilic interactions between leukocyte CD99 and EC CD99 are important for the completion of TEM. In this proposal, we will build on the knowledge gained in the last cycle to test the overarching hypothesis that these leukocyte/endothelial cell interactions recruit the LBRC to promote efficient TEM and that their distribution on the leukocyte is responsible for the sequence in which leukocyte/EC interactions trigger signaling pathways that promote TR to facilitate TEM.  In Aim I we will test the hypothesis that the distribution of PECAM and CD99 on the leukocyte is responsible for the sequential regulation of TEM. Preliminary data show that during TEM, PECAM is concentrated in the front of the leukocyte and CD99 at the rear. We suspect that this concentration is critical to clustering PECAM and CD99 on the endothelial cell. We will test our hypothesis in vitro by switching the cytoplasmic domains of PECAM and CD99 to reverse their distribution on the leukocyte and determine whether this affects the order in which they regulate TEM. We will also test whether they regulate TEM sequentially in vivo using spinning disc confocal intravital microscopy to study the process in real time.  CD99L2 (L2) is a molecule we recently discovered to play an important role in TEM. In Aim II we will identify how L2 functions to regulate TEM. L2 is diffusely distributed on the leukocyte surface. We will test the hypothesis that it regulates a step between those regulated by PECAM and CD99 using the ?sequential block? assay that we have developed and published. We will identify the signaling pathways used by L2 to carry out its function and determine whether it plays a significant role in ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury. We will study response to I/R injury by intravital microscopy in the cremaster muscle circulation over hours and in a mouse model of myocardial infarction over days.  We recently identified the long-sought mechanism by which endothelial cell CD99 signals in TEM. It resides in a multimolecular complex that activates protein kinase A (PKA). In Aim III we will identify the CD99 signaling pathways downstream of PKA. Based on preliminary data we hypothesize that Rac1 is a critical downstream effector of PKA to promote targeted recycling. We will test the role of CD99 in I/R injury in the two models as above."
"9435714","PROJECT SUMMARY    Recent levels of pertussis in the US are at their highest in 60 years. However, the currently used acellular pertussis vaccine is inadequate and no effective therapies exist for treatment of pertussis. Since antibiotic therapy is ineffective, host-targeted therapeutics are needed. However, we still have a very poor understanding of the pathogenesis of pertussis disease and therefore it is unclear which host targets are appropriate for therapeutic intervention. In RNAseq transcriptomics analysis, we found that the type I interferon (IFN) receptor subunit IFNAR1 was the most significant upstream activator of mouse lung genes differentially expressed in response to Bordetella pertussis infection. Type I IFNs are key cytokines in immune responses and antiviral defense, but they also exacerbate inflammation and pathogenesis in a variety of disease models. Type I IFNs have diverse effects on a variety of bacterial infections, being protective for some and deleterious for others. Our preliminary data suggest that type I IFNs are expressed in the lungs of B. pertussis-infected mice and exacerbate lung inflammatory pathology.  We have also been studying sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) receptor ligands as candidate host- targeted therapeutics for pertussis. An S1P receptor ligand drug, FTY720, is used in humans as a therapy for relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis, and other similar drugs are in clinical trials for various inflammatory disorders, demonstrating the translational potential of these drugs. In published studies, we found that administration of a single dose of S1P receptor ligands to B. pertussis-infected mice significantly reduced lung inflammatory pathology. Furthermore, our new preliminary data suggest that S1P receptor ligand treatment reduces inflammation by downregulating type I IFN responses in B. pertussis-infected mice, consistent with the hypothesis that type I IFNs exacerbate lung inflammatory pathology.  Therefore, the specific aims of this R21 exploratory/developmental proposal are to test the hypotheses that (i) type I IFNs contribute to lung inflammatory pathology and pathogenesis of B. pertussis disease, and (ii) S1P receptor ligands attenuate lung inflammatory pathology in B. pertussis- infected mice by inhibiting type I IFN signaling. We will use a combination of mouse infection and cell culture studies to test these hypotheses, and we will take advantage of genetically altered mice that impact type I IFN receptor signaling. Identification of host targets and development of novel therapeutics for individuals suffering from debilitating and sometimes fatal pertussis will have a major public health impact on this disease."

In the past 15 years, more than 9,500 articles have been published in food allergy. Nonetheless, these developments have yet to change the standard of clinical care for food allergy: complete avoidance of the allergenic food. The pressing need for effective therapies for food allergy can only be met by developing a deeper and more comprehensive understanding of immune mechanisms. We aim to amplify the increasing momentum of research advances in food allergy with this new GRC focused specifically on its basic and translational aspects from diverse disciplinary perspectives. Leading researchers from around the world with expertise in immunology, molecular and cell biology, and computational biology who are interested in understanding healthy and food-allergic immune function will be featured, including those who study emerging problems such as the role of the microbiome in food allergy, and the mechanisms of desensitization achieved through emerging therapies such as oral immunotherapy. This five-day international scientific conference encouraging free discussion?often of unpublished research?aims to provide cross-fertilization and collaboration among researchers in relevant fields, and will help to develop and integrate this rapidly evolving field. Our Specific Aims are: 1) Establish and maintain a dedicated forum to integrate the efforts of researchers across fields and across the globe; 2) Build a diverse, global community of scientists in a variety of disciplines whose research advances basic and mechanistic research in food allergy; and 3) Mentor early career investigators, postdoctoral scholars, and graduate students, women and minorities, in food allergy research. The inaugural, innovative Food Allergy Gordon Research Conference is designed to meet these aims, to promote cross-fertilization and collaboration among researchers in a variety of disciplines around the globe, towards integrating the emerging field of food allergy research.

"9435525","PROJECT SUMMARY Determination of the molecular structures of B cell epitopes recognized by protective antibodies provides essential insights to guide rational vaccine design. Obtaining atomically-resolved maps that comprehensively cover the surface of the antigen represents an ideal goal that would provide invaluable information to guide vaccine development. While X-ray crystallography can provide atomically-resolved maps of epitopes, at the present time, it does not have sufficient throughput for deep analysis of the diversity of the antibody repertoire. Hydrogen exchange-mass spectrometry (HX-MS) is emerging as an effective tool for epitope mapping. While promising, the method is limited both by data analysis bottlenecks and limited spatial resolution that prevent it from achieving its full potential for high resolution, high throughput epitope mapping. This collaborative research between Dr. David Weis and Dr. Jeffrey Gray brings together their complementary expertise in HX-MS and protein modelling to produce new software tools to improve the accuracy, resolution, and throughput of HX-MS-based epitope mapping. The outcome will enable epitope-mapping pipelines capable of generating 10-20 atomically-resolved epitopes per week, allowing researchers to more fully define the repertoire of antibody responses to infectious agents and toxins. This research is significant because it will yield new tools to accelerate the rational design and testing of much-needed vaccines to counteract emerging infectious diseases and biothreat agents within NIAID's portfolio. The specific aims of this proposal are to develop new algorithms and software for (1) rapid, fully-automated processing of HX-MS data, (2) fully-automated classification of HX-MS results, and (3) obtaining atomically- resolved epitopes from HX-MS data. The product of the proposed research will be new software tools that implement innovative algorithms. To accomplish Aim #1, algorithms that treat HX-MS data as two-dimensional images and adapt image comparison algorithms to identify and extract the shifted mass spectra will be developed. To accomplish Aim #2, significance testing based on the volcano plot method and classify the results using k-means clustering will be used. To accomplish Aim #3, medium-resolution HX-MS-mapped epitope will be used to constrain computational protein docking between the solved antigen structure and the modeled antibody using the Rosetta protein modeling suite. Through an existing collaboration with Dr. Nicholas Mantis sponsored by NIAID, the team has access to VHHs and an expanding library of solved structures of these VHHs bound to ricin toxin. The solved structures present a unique opportunity to independently refine and validate the epitope mapping pipeline based on solved structures."
"9433809","PROJECT SUMMARY Memory CD8+ T cells are essential cells of the immune system, retained post infection to protect from subsequent immunological insults. Many transcriptional regulators and some proximal signaling cascades associated with both naive and memory T cells have been described and have greatly informed the process by which immunological memory is formed. Despite clear differences in transcription factor expression and cytokine requirements, how global signal transduction induced by antigen binding differs between naive and memory CD8+ T cells is completely unknown and thus represents a significant gap in our knowledge base. One key signaling event that occurs in response to TCR stimulation is the activation of kinases that phosphorylate tyrosine residues on downstream signaling proteins. Therefore, comparing the phosphotyrosine signaling networks between naive and memory T cells will identify targets for modulation of the CD8+ T cell immune response to positively influence response to disease and vaccine efficacy. The objective of this specific proposal is to determine the intracellular signaling pathways that are unique to restimulated memory CD8+ T cells. Our central hypothesis is that distinct signal transduction pathways regulate the memory CD8+ T cell response. The rationale and scientific premise for the proposed work is that understanding at a global proteomic level the changes that occur in T cells as they differentiate from naive to memory T cells will enable more efficacious vaccine and drug treatment design to combat disease and infection. We will test our central hypothesis with the following specific aims: 1) Determine the TCR signal transduction changes that occur in CD8+ naïve and memory T cells. To profile kinase signaling networks, we will utilize a highly sensitive quantitative mass spectrometric assay we developed on naive, effector and memory CD8+ T cells. Based on a preliminary screen, we identified that Jak2 is hyperphosphorylated, indicating it is a key mediator of the recall response. We will test the hypothesis that Jak2 hyperactivation is critical for memory recall responses. Together, the completion of Aim1 will identify novel signaling networks that contribute to CD8+ memory recall responses and 2) Defining phosphorylation of CREB binding protein (CBP) as a molecular switch that regulates transcriptional networks in memory CD8+ T cells. Given our preliminary data in which we uncovered unique signaling pathways associated with CD8+ memory T cell formation, we hypothesize that in memory CD8+ T cells, increased Jak2 activation drives phosphorylation of CBP to promote a unique transcriptional landscape versus a naïve T cell. We will identify how phosphorylation of CBP regulates binding of transcription factors such as CREB and MYB. Additionally, we will take a genetic approach to determine how CBP functions in the formation of CD8+ memory cells and CD8+ memory recall responses. Together, data obtained in this Aim2 will establish a novel mechanism that explains how changes in tyrosine kinase activity associated with CD8+ T cell memory formation drive unique transcriptional programs."
"9447402","Abstract Lower-income and minority groups face significant health disparities with respect to obesity, cancer, heart disease and other diet-related chronic conditions. Poor diets, low in fruits and vegetables (F&V) and high in saturated fat, sodium and sugar, contribute to many of the health problems faced by vulnerable groups. While socioeconomic status and other individual level factors (i.e., food preferences, time and skills to prepare healthy food, etc.) can lead to reduced F&V consumption, these must be viewed in an environmental context. Compared with higher-income neighborhoods, lower-income and minority neighborhoods are less likely to have stores that sell a variety of F&V and other healthy foods. And when stores are available, produce may not be affordable, high quality or culturally appropriate. Farmers' markets and mobile produce markets (MM) have become increasingly popular strategies to alleviate food access concerns in underserved communities. However, it is unclear if these programs have the necessary components to have an appreciable impact on diet. Our research team recently completed one of the first randomized controlled trials of a MM program called the Veggie Van. Veggie Van was run in partnership with our team and a small non-profit organization in North Carolina; it delivered boxes of fresh, locally grown produce and food-focused education to communities with significant barriers to F&V consumption including availability, affordability, quality and knowledge. In this small cluster-randomized trial in 12 communities (N=201), we saw impressive changes in F&V intake with intervention participants eating almost 1 more cups per day of F&Vs than the control group. Intervention participants also reported increases in perceived access to healthy foods and Veggie Van customers attributed many dietary changes to the MM program. While these results are very promising, we believe it is important to test the effectiveness of the Veggie Van program when implemented by different organizations in multiple communities. If shown to be effective, we can create a research-tested intervention toolkit which can be disseminated to communities across the country. For this research, we will use a request for proposals process to identify 8 organizations nationwide that are well-qualified to implement the Veggie Van model. Organizations will identify appropriate sites for MM deliveries (32 total) and we will randomize them to either an implementation or planning condition. With the help of our team's technical assistance and provided funding, partner organizations will engage community members in the process and initiate a MM program. We will use a Type 1 Hybrid Effectiveness-Implementation to measure effectiveness (diet, BMI, dermal carotenoids) and implementation (customer reach and sales, process measures, qualitative interviews with MM staff). We will also examine sustainability of MM financial models and determine implementation standards (i.e., dose needed to maintain impact) for inclusion in our MM toolkit for future dissemination."
"9443176","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is a lethal disease whose incidence is on the rise. It is categorized into various subtypes, with clear cell RCC (ccRCC) representing about 85% of all RCC tumors. Current targeted molecular strategies, including tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), have resulted in a doubling of progression-free survival and significant gains in overall survival in ccRCC patients. Despite the therapeutic progress, complete and durable responses have been noted in only a few cases. Moreover, about one quarter of the ccRCC patients are primarily refractory to treatment with TKIs. It is well established that TKIs have a direct cytotoxic effect on tumor cells in addition to the inhibition of tumor angiogenesis. We have applied CRISPR/Cas9 based high- throughput loss-of-function screening to identify new genes involved in the resistance to sunitinib, one of the most commonly used TKIs given to RCC patients. This screen identified farnesyltransferase (FTase)- dependent proteins regulating endosomal/lysosomal formation as important factors contributing to sunitinib resistance. Several studies indicate lysosomal sequestration as a novel mechanism of drug resistance. In addition, the farnesylation of Rheb is required for activation of mTORC1 signaling. Importantly, inhibition of mTORC1 reinstates sensitivity to TKIs in tumor cells of various origins. Excitingly, treatment with a clinically relevant FTase inhibitor (FTIs), lonafarnib, completely reinstates the sensitivity of RCC cells to sunitinib both in vitro and in vivo. In addition, combinatorial treatment with sunitnib + lonafarnib was well tolerated in vivo, highlighting the potential promise in the clinic. The proposed studies will test a novel hypothesis that lonafarnib enhances the antitumor activity of sunitinib, at least in part, through two potential mechanisms: (1) dysregulation of lysosomal sequestration of sunitinib, and (2) suppression of Rheb-mediated mTORC1 activation. To test our hypothesis and to validate the therapeutic value of combined treatment with lonafarnib and sunitinib, we propose the following Specific Aims: (1) To identify mechanisms underlying the synergistic antitumor activity of TKIs and FTIs; (2) To evaluate the antitumor efficacy of combined sunitinib and lonafarnib treatment using direct human-to-mouse xenograft model of ccRCC."
"9392880","Is there a form of benign brain amyloidosis in aging? Although relatively rare, the identification of aged individuals with significant amyloid pathology (lacking tauopathy) that are cognitively normal is one of the lines of evidence that argues against the notion that amyloid-? (A?) deposition is a direct mediator of cognitive decline. Our study seeks a potential explanation for cases of amyloidosis that appear benign by testing the hypothesis that the brains of these pathologic aging (PA) individuals, as compared to Alzheimer disease (AD) brain, contain a distinct conformer of A? assembly that is essentially benign. One potential explanation for amyloid pathology that is benign, in regard to cognition, is that A? may assemble into structures that are conformationally distinct, with some conformations possessing an activity that diminishes cognitive function while others do not. To address this question, we will take advantage of recent studies that have shown that rate and character of amyloid deposition in vulnerable transgenic mice can be greatly influenced by injecting homogenates from human Alzheimer?s disease (AD) brains into their brains. Our preliminary studies, presented below, demonstrate that we have extended this model system to include brain homogenates of PA brains. As expected, we observed robust acceleration of A? pathology in transgenic APPswe/ind mice that were injected with two different AD brain homogenates. Although less consistent, we similarly observed accelerated amyloid pathology in mice injected with brain homogenates from 4 PA cases, with one seeding comparably to AD brain. We propose to seed the brains of two distinct lines of transgenic mice that develop amyloid pathology late in life with homogenates from AD and PA brains, and then assess whether pathology induced in these animals causes cognitive impairment. If PA represents a form of A? amyloidosis that is benign, then we would expect that only the mice seeded with AD homogenates will develop cognitive deficits. Apart from clarifying the distinction between PA and AD, our study may have therapeutic implications. If there are forms of A? amyloidosis that are benign, then it might be possible to chemically modulate the conformer of A? that is associated with cognitive decline to favor the benign forms and thus reduce the burden of A? assemblies that diminish cognitive function."
"9388382","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Severe asthma is a significant health care concern with patients having poorer asthma control, frequent asthma attacks, and increased heath care costs compared to milder asthma phenotypes. Boys have an increased prevalence of severe asthma compared to girls. This increased prevalence of severe asthma switches from boys to women around puberty, suggesting a role for sex hormones. However, it remains unknown how gender and ovarian hormones affect severe asthma pathogenesis. IL-17A, a cytokine secreted by CD4+ T cells and ?? T cells, is increased in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of patients with severe asthma compared to milder asthma phenotypes. IL-17A is also associated with increased airway inflammation, airway responsiveness (AR), and mucus production. Our preliminary data show increased IL-17A protein expression in Th17 differentiated cells from women compared to men. We also show 17?-estradiol (E2) and progesterone (P4) administration in ovariectomized female mice increased Th17 differentiated cell expression of IL-17A. We hypothesize that female gender, via ovarian hormones, increases Th17 cell differentiation and IL-17A secretion from Th17 cells and ?? T cells. We further hypothesize that in vivo 17?-E2 and P4 administration increases Th17-mediated airway inflammation, AR, and mucus production in mice. In Aim 1, we will differentiate Th17 cells from healthy women and men and determine the role of gender in Let-7f regulation of IL-23 receptor (R) and IL-17A protein expression on Th17 differentiating cells. In Aim 2, memory T cells will be isolated to determine if women with severe asthma have increased IL-17A secreting memory CD4+ T cells compared to men with severe asthma. In Aim 3, we will delineate the mechanisms by which in vivo administration of 17?-E2 and P4 increases IL-17A-mediated airway inflammation in mice. Our results will be the first to determine the role of gender and ovarian hormones on IL-17A-mediated airway inflammation in severe asthma. Our findings may also be helpful in designing future clinical trials by determining if women and men with severe asthma have differential IL-17A production and responses to therapeutics in clinical trials for moderate to severe asthma."
"9410102","PROJECT SUMMARY Elderly patients are the largest consumers of prescription and non-prescription medications and have been reported to account for $887 million in treatment costs for medication errors likely due to altered pharmacokinetics, polypharmacy, decline in cognition, and lower health literacy. As a result of this confluence of issues that affect the aging population, medication management tools designed to accommodate the particular needs of older adults can be greatly beneficial. While there have been many advances made in mobile health technologies to assist with aspects of medication management such as adherence reminders and access to drug labeling information, few products are designed to enable facile identification and verification of a patient's prescribed medications. The innovation proposed in this Phase I SBIR addresses this gap in medication management tools designed for older adult patients. We will use a combination of innovative mechanical and software engineering techniques to build the Scriptmate system, which will be designed to assist older adult patients with easy identification and verification of medications using a pill scanner and facilitate medication consolidation, and access to medication information via patient-facing mobile application. The goal of this Phase I SBIR is to assess the feasibility and usability of Scriptmate. Three substudies will be conducted with older adult patients and pharmacists using a user-centered design framework to address the project goal: a formative assessment (N=20), prototype walkthrough interviews (N=10) and one-on-one usability testing sessions (N=10)."
"9439250","ABSTRACT  Amyloid precursor-like protein 2 (APLP2) is a type I transmembrane protein that is highly conserved across mammalian species. Data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (NCI TCGA) shows that pancreatic adenocarcinoma patients whose tumors exhibit lower (compared to higher) levels of APLP2 have significantly better survival. By in vitro experiments and in vivo xenograft approaches, we found that APLP2 increases the growth, migration, and metastasis of pancreatic cancer cells. New RNA-Seq analysis also supports APLP2?s identity as a master regulator in the development of pancreatic adenocarcinoma. We showed that APLP2 is elevated in human and mouse pancreatic adenocarcinoma tissue samples, and that APLP2, as well as the fragments of APLP2 that are produced by the cleavage activity of the beta-secretase enzyme, are over expressed in pancreatic cancer cell lines. Chemical inhibitors of beta-secretase have been synthesized by multiple pharmaceutical companies because beta-secretase cleavage of a protein related to APLP2 (called amyloid precursor protein) is a step in the production of the beta-amyloid peptide implicated in Alzheimer?s disease progression. Several of these beta-secretase inhibitors are now in Phase III clinical trials for Alzheimer?s disease patients. These beta-secretase inhibitors also block APLP2 processing. We have found that treatment of pancreatic cancer cells with beta-secretase inhibitors results in APLP2 cleavage inhibition and decreased pancreatic cancer cell growth (without affecting growth of a non-transformed pancreatic cell line). In this project, we will test a beta-secretase inhibitor (in combination with standard pancreatic cancer chemotherapy) for therapeutic efficacy in orthotopic xenograft pancreatic cancer mouse models and in a genetically engineered mouse pancreatic cancer model, and we will investigate the mechanism underlying the efficacy of the therapeutic regimen. Our central hypothesis is that beta-secretase inhibitors (in combination with chemotherapy) will be effective against pancreatic cancer by influencing APLP2-linked pathways. Our Specific Aims are to: (1) evaluate in vivo the therapeutic effect of a beta-secretase inhibitor as a pancreatic cancer treatment in combination with chemotherapy, and (2) assess the role of an APLP2-linked signaling mechanism in beta-secretase inhibitor reduction of pancreatic cancer growth. We anticipate that the accomplishment of our Aims will contribute to the generation of novel treatments targeting APLP2 that will increase pancreatic cancer patient survival."
"9461178","PROJECT SUMMARY  Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the US and worldwide. Studies provide strong evidence that long-term exposures to many air pollutants (e.g. particulate matter < 2.5 microns in diameter (PM2.5), ozone, nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and weather variables (e.g. summer temperature variability, heat and cold waves) are associated with CVD. However most of these studies estimate the impact of long-term exposure to only one environmental agent at a time, only infrequently adjusting for the potential confounding effects of the others. In reality we are exposed to these air pollutants and weather variables simultaneously. Therefore without rigorous approaches to estimate the health effects associated with multiple exposures, the health burden will likely be underestimated. In addition to a rigorous and comprehensive quantification of these health effects, it is important to characterize susceptibility and identify modifying factors so the health consequences of multiple exposures can be prevented and reduced. While inherent characteristics, lifestyle, and contextual factors are hypothesized to either exacerbate or mitigate adverse health effects, very little is known regarding their potential interaction with multiple exposures. Specifically, very little is known regarding 1) which lifestyle factors (e.g. physical activity, diet, smoking) can mitigate or further exacerbate adverse effects of both air pollution and temperature; 2) which contextual measures (e.g. walkability, green space) can mitigate these risks; and 4) whether multiple exposures also affect survival after a non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI). Furthermore, no study has been able to consider the real-world situation of the simultaneous effects of multiple modifying factors.  The goals of this proposal are to comprehensively address these gaps of knowledge. We have access to an unprecedented collection of five large US-based cohorts with a wealth of time-varying information on lifestyle factors, residential addresses, and medical record confirmed cases: the Nurses' Health Study (NHS), the Nurses' Health Study II (NHSII), the Health Professionals' Follow-up Study (HPFS), the whole cohort of Medicare enrollees (MC), and the Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey linked to Medicare Claims data (MC- MCBS). Our specific aims are to develop new methods to assess multiple exposures in the context of multiple confounding and effect modification; to assess the association between long-term exposure to multiple environmental agents (air pollution and weather) on risk of CVD, mortality, and survival after a non-fatal MI; and to characterize interactions between multiple environmental exposures, inherent characteristics, contextual and lifestyle factors."
"9387459","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Sensitization to fungi, such as the mold Aspergillus fumigatus, is increasingly becoming linked with asthma severity. Over the last several years, our laboratory has identified protective roles for Dectin-1 mediated beta-glucan recognition and Dectin-1 dependent IL-17A and IL-22 production during acute challenge with A. fumigatus (invasive aspergillosis, IA). Unexpectedly, in a chronic A. fumigatus exposure model of fungal asthma (A. fumigatus associated asthma, AFAA), we recently reported that the absence of Dectin-1 or IL-22 resulted in markedly improved lung function in the presence of reductions in multiple pro-allergic and pro- inflammatory mediators (Lilly et al., J Immunol 189:3653; 2012). Our studies further suggested that reduced severity of AFAA observed in the absence of Dectin-1 or IL-22 correlated with lower levels of the pro-allergic and known asthma susceptibility cytokine IL-33 (IL-1F11). Indeed, preliminary data from mice deficient in IL- 33R show reduced AFAA severity. However, a link between IL-22 and IL-33 is not known. In preliminary data, we show that during AFAA, production of IL-1?IL-1F1) is dependent on IL-22. We further show that the novel IL-1 family member IL-36? (IL-1F9) was upregulated in the lungs more than 100-fold during IA, yet significantly reduced in Il22-/- mice during both IA and AFAA. IL-36? can induce IL-1?n the lungs and IL-1?as been recently reported to induce IL-33 production by epithelial cells, suggesting a possible IL-22 IL-36? IL-1?L-33 axis in immunopathogenesis during fungal asthma. In new preliminary studies, we show that the absence of IL-36R signaling or neutralization of IL-1?eads to lower CCL17 levels during AFAA. We further show that chronic exposure to an A. fumigatus trehalose-6-phosphate phosphatase mutant (orlA), which has elevated cell wall alpha-glucan levels, resulted in more severe AFAA (higher induction of IL-22, IL-33 and CCL17). These results suggest that recognition of moieties in the A. fumigatus cell wall affects severity of fungal asthma. Finally, in collaboration with the NHLBI-sponsored Severe Asthma Research Program (SARP), we have identified multiple SNPs in Il23, Il17a and Il22 in fungal skin-test (+) asthmatics that correlated with asthma severity. In new pilot studies, we show feasibility of measuring cytokines and chemokines in sputum or BAL fluid from skin test (+) vs. skin test (-) asthmatics and our ability to correlate them with asthma severity. Further studies are required to determine the magnitude by which IL-23, IL-17A and IL-22 levels are modulated in these individuals as well as whether the levels of IL-36?, IL-1?nd IL-33 are also modulated. Collectively, our central hypothesis is that IL-22-induced IL-1 family members contribute to immunopathogenesis during fungal asthma. To address this hypothesis, we have proposed the following three independent, interrelated Aims: (1) elucidate IL-22-dependent mechanisms contributing to immunopathogenesis during fungal asthma, (2) examine the contribution of specific fungal cell wall moieties in IL-22 induction and fungal asthma severity and (3) define the IL-23/IL-17A/IL-22 axis in human asthmatics that are skin-test (+) for fungi."
"9402033","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Over 60% of adults age ? 65 years have high blood pressure (BP), but optimal management of high BP in the elderly remains controversial. Contrary to evidence in middle age that lowering BP is clearly beneficial, data in older adults are inconsistent and high BP may not be a risk factor in all elders. We recently reported that, among participants in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey age e65 years, high BP was a risk factor for all-cause and cardiovascular (CV) death only among persons in better health status (defined as fast walking of a 20-ft walk test). In contrast, high BP was not a risk factor among slow walkers. Additionally, the benefit of lowering BP in all elders remains an issue of debate; a recent meta-analysis in persons age 80 years and older reported no benefit of BP treatment on mortality, and significant heterogeneity across trials. Finally, there is growin concern for potential harms associated with treatment to lower BP. Excessive lowering of BP, particularly diastolic, has been associated with increased risk for death and cardiovascular events in some studies. In the proposed research, we propose a novel paradigm where the associations of BP with adverse outcomes in older persons are considered in the setting of the complex aging process. Our long-term goal is to reliably identify elderly persons in whom BP treatment is beneficial and those in whom treatment is ineffective or even harmful, by defining subpopulations of similar health status. Specifically, aim 1 proposes to elucidate factors from four domains (functional, cognitive/mental, self-rated health, and physiologic) that can identify elderly persons in whom high systolic BP is strongly associated with higher risk for death and CV events, and those in whom it is not, using data from three NIH-funded cohorts: Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS), Health Aging and Body Composition (Health ABC) and Sacramento Area Latino Study of Aging (SALSA). In aim 2, we will evaluate the role of diastolic BP across level of health status. Finally, based on findings from these observational cohorts, in aim 3 we will evaluate whether these factors can identify elderly persons in whom treatment to lower BP is of maximum benefit in two randomized controlled trials: the Systolic Hypertension in the Elderly (SHEP) and the Secondary Prevention of Small Subcortical Strokes (SPS3). Since participants in trials are healthier than the U.S. population, we will also evaluate the effect of treatment in the observational studies, using state-of-the-art causal inference methods, which can correct for the bias of standard analytic approaches. Completion of these aims will substantially advance our understanding of the importance of high BP in older adults; will improve our ability to identify elderly persons who will benefit from BP treatment; will allow a systematic understanding of groups in whom evidence for BP treatment is lacking; and will guide design of future trials of hypertension in elderly adults."
"9448890","Summary Epigenetic regulation of vascular functions has been found to play crucial roles in cardiovascular diseases. Vascular endothelial cells (ECs), which are exposed to different flow patterns, regulate vascular homeostasis. Differential epigenetic changes, e.g. histone modifications, caused by different flow patterns regulate EC gene expression profile and hence functional consequences. The coupling of histone phosphorylation, methylation, and acetylation have recently been identified to regulate gene expressions through the distinct chromatin remodeling complexes, which would alter the consequential phenotypic outcome. However, there is a paucity of study in the flow-regulation of histone modifications in vascular cells. We hypothesize that the coupling among epigenetic histone phosphorylation, methylation, and acetylation may serve as a transducing mechanism to regulate EC gene expressions under different patterns of flows. We will develop a directed evolution strategy for the systematic optimization and tuning of FRET biosensors with distinct colors to simultaneously monitor different histone modifications with high sensitivity and specificity. These biosensors will be used to track multiple histone modifications simultaneously in the same live cell and unravel the evolving multiplex landscape of histone modifications under different flows. We will further employ the endonuclease-deficient Cas9 (dCas9), small guide RNAs (sgRNAs) and split FPs to track the dynamics of histone modifications at the specific loci of EC phenotype marker genes. Our epigenetic manipulation system will then be employed to modulate epigenetics at these specific loci and determine their effects on gene expressions and consequent cellular functions in single live cells under different flows. The identified epigenetic profiles will then be modulated in vivo, and the consequent gene expression and phenotypic outcome examined. Four specific aims are proposed: 1) Develop and optimize FRET biosensors to visualize the dynamic histone modifications in single cells, 2) Unravel the spatiotemporal coupling of histone phosphorylation-methylation-acetylation in regulating EC functions under different flows, 3) Establish the roles of locus-specific histone modifications in regulating EC gene expression under flows, 4) Elucidate the effect of histone modifications on gene expression and lesion formation in vivo. The simultaneous tracking of the spatiotemporal dynamics of histone modifications in the nucleus in conjunction with cell proliferation and inflammation in a single live cell will allow the elucidation of the spatiotemporal transducing mechanism in regulating epigenetic modulations and pathophysiological consequences upon the exposure of ECs to hemodynamic cues. The mechanistic insights obtained should allow us to identify the potential molecular targets and facilitate the design of pharmaceutical interventions for pathologic processes. As such, the project should have transformative impact in the field of vascular mechanobiology, particularly related to the molecular regulations of cell cycle and inflammation in mediating the development of atherosclerosis."
"9596249","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Refugee children and families who are resettled in the United States face dramatic disparities in the incidence and treatment of mental health disorders. Resettlement stressors (poverty, limited access to care) and acculturative challenges (differences in cultural norms, discrimination) often exacerbate risks due to war- related trauma exposure. Commonly, refugee mental health services are limited-usually with a narrow focus on clinical treatment of PTSD-and rarely respond holistically to the needs or priorities of refugee communities; few interventions are designed for use across diverse cultures and refugee groups, despite rapidly evolving refugee demographics. Consequently, mental health service usage is low in resettled refugee populations. For refugee children and adolescents characterized by risk factors such as parental trauma, intergenerational conflict and other acculturative and resettlement stressors, preventive interventions hold great promise but are exceedingly rare. Cross-cultural application of community-based participatory research (CBPR) methods can increase understanding of risk and protective factors in refugee communities and contribute to development of responsive, flexible, interventions to promote healthy family functioning and child mental health and help prevent mental health disparities. We propose a CBPR-driven hybrid implementation effectiveness trial that builds upon ongoing collaborative research and community awareness-raising within Somali Bantu and Lhotshampas Bhutanese refugee communities in New England. Preliminary research and CBPR-based needs assessments with these groups has identified numerous cultural and community strengths as well as ongoing problems of difficult parent-child interactions, poor communication, and family conflict which interact with ongoing stressors to increase risks for child emotional and behavioral problems. Using a CBPR approach, a family based prevention model, the Family Strengthening Intervention for Refugees (FSI-R) was adapted from a tested model used in Africa and designed for delivery by refugee community health workers with through a process involving stakeholder consultation and local refugee Community Advisory Board input. Pilot data on the FSI-R demonstrates strong feasibility and acceptability, but further data are needed on effectiveness as well as barriers and facilitators to implementation by community health workers embedded in refugee-serving social services agencies. Specific aims are to (1) examine the impact of a family-based preventive intervention on outcomes of parent-child relationships, family functioning, and child mental health using a Hybrid Type 2Effectiveness-Implementation Design (families with children aged 7-17 in a two-arm randomized controlled trial); (2) identify barriers and facilitators to implementation of the FSI-R by community health workers by conducting a process evaluation concurrent with the delivery of the intervention; and (3) strengthen the science of community engagement to address health disparities by fortifying CBPR-based pathways of change via collaborative partnerships between refugee communities, service providers, and academic stakeholders."
"9607658","To address persistent cost and quality challenges, US policymakers have pursued multiple delivery and payment reforms. Alternative payment models (APMs), a key component of the latest proposed reforms under MACRA, build on the delivery and payment reforms that we have experimented with over the past 5 years. These include: 1) Medicare and Medicaid Electronic Health Record Incentive Programs, also known as ?Meaningful Use? (MU), which pay providers for adopting and using certified electronic health records for core clinical documentation; 2) Patient-Centered Medical Home (PCMH) programs that target care processes that ensure that primary care is accessible, well-coordinated, and team-based; and 3) Accountable Care Organization (ACO) programs that align financial incentives of primary care providers, hospitals, and other providers to improve quality and value. Each of these programs has an associated body of evidence that examines its effectiveness. However, research to date has not identified the patterns of primary care provider participation, and how the combination and sequencing interact to affect the magnitude of resulting gains. Our project is focused on capturing participation patterns and near-term effects of MU and PCMH programs in the context of ACO efforts because these are key components of APMs. They are also all voluntary programs, and voluntary participation is expected to be emphasized by the new Administration. We propose to examine a set of outcomes that are expected to improve under these programs: adherence to evidence-based care, reductions in avoidable hospital utilization (e.g., ambulatory-care sensitive admissions), and reductions in spending. We plan to use secondary data sources that capture primary care provider participation in MU, PCMH, and ACO programs along with Medicare claims data on patient outcomes to (1) Identify patterns of primary care practice participation in delivery system reform efforts (MU and PCMH) and payment reform (ACOs), and whether patterns vary by practice characteristics; (2) Test the impact of primary care practice participation in delivery system reform efforts (MU and PCMH) on outcomes targeted by these programs; and (3) Test the extent to which primary care practice participation in payment reform (ACOs) impacts the magnitude of gains from engagement in delivery system reform efforts. Our study is significant because it systematically assesses the impact of the major policy efforts to improve primary care. Our study is innovative because it explores the interactions between the varied delivery and payment reform efforts in order to inform the likely impact of APMs and guide the design of future policies."
"9389530","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cardiovascular diseases exert a massive burden on human health, and our long term objective is to attenuate the excessive accumulation of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) that is central to many of these diseases. The tunica media of the normal artery is composed of alternating circumferential layers of VSMCs and elastic lamellae. Diverse arterial disorders, including atherosclerosis, restenosis, pulmonary hypertension and supravalvular aortic stenosis (SVAS) are plagued by defective elastic lamellae as well as hypermuscularization. SVAS, a devastating human disease characterized by an increased VSMC burden that occludes large arteries, is caused by heterozygous null mutations in the elastin gene ELN. Similarly, elastin mutant mice develop hypermuscularization and stenosis of large arteries, such as the aorta. Major vascular surgery is the only current treatment for SVAS as no effective pharmacological options are available. A major obstacle to developing effective therapies for vascular disorders is the poor understanding of the cellular source(s) of excess VSMCs; indeed no prior studies have traced the lineage of any cell populations in elastin mutants. In addition, the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying aortic hypermuscularization in elastin mutants are not well defined. Our initial studies indicate that integrin ?expression and integrin signaling is robustly upregulated in the elastin mutant aorta and that reduction of ?levels or activity attenuates the excessive muscularization. Furthermore, reduction of the dosage of the gene encoding ? Itgb3, extends the viability of Eln(-/-) pups which is unprecedented for any genetic or pharmacological intervention. A potentially attractive strategy for reducing arterial hypermuscularization in SVAS is attenuating the increased ?expression. Although little is known regarding regulation of ?expression, the growth arrest-specific homeobox (Gax) transcription factor is expressed in VSMCs and Gax overexpression reduces ?levels, proliferation and migration. We hypothesize that in elastin mutants, Gax downregulation induces integrin ?expression in pre-existing aortic smooth muscle resulting in aberrant VSMC orientation, proliferation and migration and thus aortic stenosis. This proposal utilizes studies of transgenic mutant mice, VSMCs isolated from the murine aorta and human SVAS aortic tissue and cells to test this hypothesis in three specific aims: 1) in the elastin mutant aorta, identify the cellular source(s) of excessive VSMCs; 2) in elastin deficient mice, murine VSMCs and human SVAS-derived smooth muscle cells, elucidate the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying integrin ?induced excess aortic muscularization; and 3) elucidate the role of Gax in mediating enhanced integrin ?expression and hypermuscularization in elastin mutants. Taken together, our proposed studies will delineate mechanisms underlying the identified link between elastin deficiency, integrin ?and aortic hypermuscularization and thereby provide concrete steps towards developing novel therapeutic strategies for SVAS and other vasculoproliferative diseases."
"9430963","Project Summary/Abstract  Endothelial cell (EC) migration is essential to heal arterial injuries such as those that occur during balloon angioplasty or bypass grafting. Oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL) and lysophosphatidylcholine (lysoPC), a product of LDL oxidation and the major lysophospholipid in oxLDL, accumulate in atherosclerotic arteries and at sites of arterial injury, and inhibit EC migration. Limited EC healing contributes to thrombogenicity, smooth muscle cell proliferation, and eventual restenosis. Rapid EC healing has been shown to limit intimal hyperpla- sia after angioplasty or prosthetic graft implantation.  Lipid oxidation products cause a prolonged rise in intracellular free calcium ion concentration ([Ca2+]i) that inhibits EC migration. We discovered that oxLDL and lysoPC activate canonical transient receptor potential 6 (TRPC6) channels, and this initiates a series of events leading to activation of TRPC5 that is responsible for the prolonged increase in [Ca2+]i that inhibits EC migration. The importance of the TRPC6 to TRPC5 activation cascade in vivo is shown by: 1) the activation of TRPC6 and TRPC5 by a high cholesterol diet, and 2) the inhi- bition of arterial healing in wild-type mice on a high cholesterol diet, but dramatically less inhibition in TRPC6-/- or TRPC5-/- mice. Unfortunately, no TRPC6 inhibitor has been developed for clinical use. We have discovered, however, that TRPC6 activation requires influx of calcium through arachidonic acid-regulated calcium (ARC) channels. Based on our preliminary data, we postulate that lipid oxidation products activate TRPC6 channels by activating phospholipase A2 (PLA2) to release cellular arachidonic acid that opens ARC channels. The Ca2+ that enters through the ARC channels activates a Src kinase that leads to the opening of TRPC6 chan- nels. To test this hypothesis we will determine the mechanism of the initial lysoPC-induced increase in [Ca2+]i, investigating the role of PLA2 activation and ARC channels and the specific type of PLA2 involved. We will also explore the mechanism by which the increase in [Ca2+]i activates TRPC6, investigating the specific Src kinase that is activated. The effect of PLA2 and Src kinase inhibitors on TRPC6 activation and EC migration in vitro will be studied, and the ability of these inhibitors to block TRPC activation and promote EC healing and inhibit intimal hyperplasia will be explored in animals on a chow or high fat diet using a mouse carotid injury model and a rabbit vascular graft model.  The proposed studies will lead to a better understanding of the mechanisms by which lipid oxidation prod- ucts inhibit EC migration and promote intimal hyperplasia. This will allow development of targeted interventions to inhibit TRPC6 activation and promote EC migration into angioplasty sites or onto cardiovascular implants to improve the outcome after vascular interventions in patients with cardiovascular disease."
"9572761","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): How visual information is processed and transformed in the nervous system is a fundamental question in vision research. Given its clear importance in visually-guided behaviors and the available genetic tools, the mouse superior colliculus (SC) holds great promise for understanding visual signal transformation and its mechanisms. The SC is a layered structure important for multimodal integration and sensorimotor transformation, and its superficial layers are purely visual and receive direct retinotopic inputs from the retina. In his proposal, the investigators will study the brain circuitry and synaptic mechanisms underlying the important transformations that take place in the retinocollicular pathway, especially the processing of motion direction. First, 2-photon calcium imaging will be performed to determine the direction selectivity of individual SC neurons and their spatial organization. These experiments will establish whether there is a depth-, region-, and/or cell type-specific organization of direction selectivity in the superficial SC, thereby forming a foundation for the following aims. Second, the investigators will determine the response properties of the retinal input that project to the SC. Genetically-encoded calcium indicators will be expressed in retinal ganglion cells and 2- photon imaging will be performed to visualize their axonal terminals in the colliculus. Third, the methods of imaging retinal terminals and collicular neurons will be used in a line of transgenic mice where retinocollicular projections are spatially altered, in order to determine whether direction selective retinal input is required for the direction selectivity in th SC. Finally, the investigator will perform in vivo whole cell recording to study visually-evoked responses in the SC. These experiments will be performed in transgenic mice where excitatory SC neurons can be silenced by optogenetic stimulation, thereby exposing the retinal input to the recorded cells. By comparing the selectivity of the total and retinal input to individual SC neurons, these experiments will start to reveal the synaptic mechanisms underlying the processing and transformation of direction selectivity in the retinocollicular pathway.  Together, these experiments will generate important data needed for a complete understanding of visual processing in the brain. Because normal visual processing is compromised in a number of neurological and psychiatric disorders, such as dyslexia, schizophrenia and autism spectrum disorders, these studies will provide insights for the understanding and treatment of these disorders."
"9453861","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Arsenic contamination of groundwater remains a widespread public health crisis, affecting an estimated 150 million people worldwide, including 13 million in the United States. Even at low doses, chronic arsenic exposure leads to multiple morbidities and mortalities. A growing body of literature demonstrates the health impacts of in utero arsenic exposure resulting in long term increases in morbidity, a prime example of which is increased risk for chronic respiratory disease (CRD). Whereas many of the mechanisms are unclear, it is known that in utero arsenic exposure leads to pulmonary hypoplasia, or decreased lung growth. Using a microfluidic ex vivo culture model of the embryonic lung, we can culture lung explants in a physiologically relevant mechanical environment and simultaneously interrogate molecular and mechanical events with high temporal and spatial resolution. Our findings have demonstrated that branching is regulated by coordinated airway smooth muscle (ASM) contractions and dysregulation has major functional consequences on lung development. Additionally, we determined that arsenic alters expression of core Hippo pathway components that are known to regulate organ size. We hypothesize that fetal arsenic exposure impairs airway morphogenesis through two independent mechanisms: dysregulation of active smooth muscle contractions that guide development and hyperactivation of the Hippo growth control pathway within the airway epithelium to cause hypoplasia. We will investigate this hypothesis using our novel microfluidic embryonic organ explant culture model in two independent aims.  In our first Aim, we test the effect of arsenic on the coordinated ASM contractions that are tightly coupled to airway branching and lung growth. Whereas the function of ASM contractions are incompletely understood, it is known that ASM contractions require Ca2+ signaling. Ca2+ signaling is disrupted by arsenic in other smooth muscle tissues. Our preliminary data support dysregulated Ca2+ signaling in the ASM to cause a hypercontracted phenotype and hypoplasia. In our second Aim, we test the importance of Hippo signaling as a mediator of lung growth, using a combination of molecular signaling perturbation and morphometric techniques. Hippo signaling has been implicated in controlling organ size in a variety of systems, and improper activity can lead to dramatic hypoplasia. However, Hippo signaling has been minimally investigated in lung development. Additionally, arsenic induced activation of Hippo has been shown in mouse epidermis. In both Aims, we will target our hypothesized mediators of arsenic toxicity using either an FDA approved compound (isoprotenerol) or the recently developed small-molecular inhibitor (XMU-MP-1), potentially offering a path to prophylactic treatments for at-risk populations. In aggregate, these studies will increase understanding of the effects of arsenic exposure on early lung development, inform new policies and EPA exposure limits for expectant mothers, and hold promise to rapidly translate these findings to improve prenatal health."
"9443434","Project Summary Intrauterine exposure to ambient particulate matter (PM) air pollution has been associated with increased lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) in infants. Despite the known sensitivity of the fetus to environmental pollutants and epidemiological evidence correlating prenatal PM exposure and LRTI morbidity, mechanisms of PM enhanced pathogenesis are relatively unexplored in immunologically immature populations. Preliminary data from our novel intrauterine murine exposure model demonstrate the reduced ability of immature offspring exposed to PM in utero to develop a robust inflammatory response. Based on these data and similar results in our neonatal (i.e., <7 days of age) exposure model indicating increased respiratory infection severity following early life exposure to air pollution, we hypothesized this window of immunosuppression correlates with offspring susceptibility to severe respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) disease. RSV infection represents a significant cause infant respiratory morbidity and mortality. Its pathogenesis is known to be impacted by similar pathways affected by PM-induced oxidative stress, namely the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related transcription factor (Nrf2) antioxidant response pathway. Polymorphisms impacting maternal Nrf2 signaling have recently been reported to increase LRTI risk in infants exposed to PM in utero. Thus, to test our hypothesis and clarify the impact of maternal ability to respond to oxidative stress on offspring RSV disease severity, we will carry out two specific aims in the proposed project. In Aim 1, we will combine our novel intrauterine exposure model with our well-characterized neonatal mouse model of RSV infection to characterize RSV infection severity. Specifically, we will determine how altered pulmonary T cell profiles influence offspring adaptive immune responses. In Aim 2, we will use Nrf2-deficient and wild-type mice to investigate the role of maternal Nrf2 expression on offspring pulmonary oxidative stress responses to intrauterine PM and RSV susceptibility. We will further probe the protective role of Nrf2 through maternal dietary supplementation with a known Nrf2 inducer. Outcomes from this research will provide important insight to understand interactions between genetic and environmental determinants of immunopathogenesis of RSV infection. These findings will aid in identifying susceptible subgroups of children and establish the proof-of-principle for targeting the Nrf2 response pathway in mothers exposed to air pollution for the protection against childhood respiratory disease, a pervasive public health problem affecting millions of children worldwide."
"9464905","Nociception describes how potentially harmful stimuli are encoded, modulated, and conveyed to the sensory cortex. Noxious stimuli cause firing of primary sensory neurons, which synapse on secondary neurons in the dorsal horns of the spinal cord gray matter. Further transmission via the spinothalamic tract (STT) is modulated in the dorsal horn by a descending inhibitory pathway arising from the periaqueductal gray (PAG) and the rostral ventromedial medulla (RVM). If modulatory control of nociception is damaged, pain can be experienced without an appropriate cause, profoundly affecting quality of life. This neuropathic pain is a common but poorly- understood consequence of many neurological disorders, including multiple sclerosis and cervical spondylotic myelopathy. The overall hypothesis of this project is that dysfunction of this descending modulatory circuit, mediated by the loss of microstructural integrity in spinal cord white matter tracts, is a root cause of neuropathic pain. To investigate this, we will optimize functional and diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI and dMRI) methods for use in the brainstem and spinal cord at 7 T, quantify the blood oxygenation level- dependent (BOLD) signal in the cervical spinal cord gray matter in response to noxious thermal stimuli delivered to the arm, and identify white matter tracts in which abnormalities in diffusion MRI parameters (indicating microstructural degradation) correlate with abnormal pain modulation, as measured by quantitative neurosensory testing, clinical examination, and fMRI. This combination of functional and diffusion MRI measurements and quantitative neurosensory testing will provide new insight into the location of the white matter tracts carrying descending modulatory drive from the brainstem to the spinal cord, and allow us to investigate whether and how damage to these tracts impacts pain levels.  This career development project also includes a training plan designed to refine and address gaps in the applicant?s technical and scientific knowledge and experience, develop his research career skills, expose him to the neuroimaging community, and lay the groundwork for his career as an independent scientist. The training plan encompasses: coursework in in biostatistics, pathophysiology of neurological and psychiatric disorders, clinical neuroscience, research grant applications, and budget management; presentation of his work at technical MRI and neuroscience conferences; delivery of formal classroom lectures and small-group teaching sessions; mentorship of research volunteers; organizing a research symposium; and hands-on training during the conduct of the research project. The Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai is the ideal environment for this career development project. The combination of the Translational and Molecular Imaging Institute?s state of the art imaging resources and expert faculty, the Mount Sinai Hospital?s world-class clinical centers and their respective clinical and research faculties, and the school?s strong emphasis on translational research all contribute to this project?s enormous training potential and very high probability of success."
"9444775","PROJECT SUMMARY Depression is a heterogeneous condition with varying degrees of severity and different etiologies that contrib- ute to variability in course trajectory and psychosocial functioning. About a third of adolescents with depression exhibit manic symptoms and as such, this substantially increases the risk for psychosocial impairment and sui- cidality. Yet, few studies have examined the pathophysiology of manic symptoms in adolescent depression and how alterations in key neural systems may be associated with changes in emotional, cognitive, and behavioral functioning. This project will address this important gap by employing a dimensional approach and a longitudi- nal design to examine neural, emotional, cognitive, and behavioral substrates of manic symptoms in (non- bipolar) depressed adolescents. Given evidence that manic symptoms implicate dysregulation of emotion and behavior, the current project will test the overarching hypothesis that alterations in connectivity of fronto- striatal-limbic (FSL) circuitry underlying cognitive control of positive emotion and reward and associated altera- tions in RDoC domain-related (emotional, cognitive, behavioral) measures of functioning in Cognitive and Posi- tive Valence Systems could differentiate depressed adolescents with from those without co-occurring manic symptoms. We aim to test this model in a longitudinal study of 180 mid-/post-pubertal adolescents (12-17 years old), including 140 adolescents with clinically significant depressive symptoms varying in manic symp- toms and 40 age- and sex- matched healthy youth. In accordance with the NIMH RDoC initiative, all depressed adolescents will be recruited from treatment settings based on the presence of clinically significant depression symptoms, irrespective of their categorical depressive disorder diagnosis. The project includes at baseline: a) fMRI paradigms measuring functioning of FSL circuitry associated with cognitive control of positive emotion and reward, b) resting state and diffusion tensor imaging, and c) out-of-the scanner neurocognitive tasks (e.g., approach-avoidance). RDoC domain-related emotional (e.g., elated mood), cognitive (e.g., delay discounting), and behavioral (e.g., impulsivity) functioning and levels of arousal will be assessed using a multi-method ap- proach (e.g., computer tasks in the lab and ecologically-valid web-based mood and actigraphy measures) at baseline and repeated bi-annually over 2 years post-scan. In addition, using machine learning algorithms, ex- ploratory analyses will be performed to identify patterns of baseline neuroimaging data and trajectories of RDoC domain-related (emotional, cognitive, behavioral) measures that can predict levels of mood symptoms and functional impairment at 2 years. Findings from this study could help distinguish subgroups of depressed adolescents based on brain-behavioral relationships, improve early detection of manic symptoms in depressed youth, and inform personalized interventions (e.g., antidepressant vs. mood-stabilizer, type of psychotherapy)."
"9393234","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): K+ is concentrated in all cells and essential for many physiological processes. In bacteria, fungi, plants and protists, membrane proteins from the Superfamily of K+ Transporters, or SKT proteins, mediate homeostasis of K+. The focus of the current proposal is the SKT family member TrkH, which, together with its closely related homologs TrkG and KtrB, forms the largest sub-family of SKT proteins. TrkH/TrkG/KtrB proteins are required for cell growth and are potential targets for antibiotics. The long-term goal of the project is to understand mechanisms of operation for the SKT proteins. Previously, my lab obtained structures of TrkH from Vibrio parahaemolyticus in isolation and in complex with TrkA, a cytosolic protein comprising two Regulate- Conductance-of-K+, or RCK domains. We also measured the first single-channel currents from the TrkH-TrkA complex, and demonstrated that nucleotides binding to TrkA regulate the function of the channel. Based on these exciting results, I propose the following two Specific Aims: to unravel the mechanism of TrkA-controlled gating of TrkH; and to examine the structural basis of ion selectivity and conduction in TrkH. We will also assess how perturbations to TrkH gating, ion selectivity and conduction affect its abilit to rescue E. coli in low K+ concentrations. Combined, results from these experiments will provide new knowledge of structural underpinnings of ion permeation and gating in TrkH, and will eventually lead us to a better understanding of basic mechanisms of SKT proteins. Aim 1. To investigate the mechanism of gating in the TrkH-TrkA complex. Aim 2. To examine the mechanism of ion selectivity and permeation in TrkH."
"9433135","The host response to a viral infection initiates with the synthesis of interferons (IFNs) and antiviral factors that combat infection. The ability to resolve these responses and return to homeostasis is important, as unrestrained production of IFNs results in tissue damage. The post-transcriptional regulation of immune genes has been implicated in the resolution of IFN responses. Proteomic screens and RNA immunoprecipitation (IP) experiments revealed that zinc-finger antiviral protein short isoform (ZAP-S) negatively regulates IFNL3 mRNA. The long isoform of ZAP, ZAP-L (long), has been characterized previously as a viral restriction factor. Since ZAP is expressed as a long and a short isoform and there is currently no known function of ZAP-S, this raises the possibility that ZAP isoforms have distinct cellular functions. We hypothesize that ZAP-L functions as a viral restriction factor by degrading viral RNA, while ZAP-S binds to host interferon mRNA to resolve host antiviral responses. To test this, we will characterize the unique cellular roles of long and short isoforms of ZAP in antiviral immunity and interferon regulation. Describe the distinct subcellular localizations of ZAP isoforms and if this dictates their distinct functions. This proposal has the potential to identify a novel regulatory mechanism of IFN resolution that could have important implications for antiviral immunity and IFN mediated autoimmune diseases."
"9440757","Aphasia is an acquired impairment of language abilities resulting from damage to the left hemisphere from stroke, head trauma or other neurological conditions. It can affect any aspect of spoken and/or written language processing and can range from mild to severe. As language provides us with a unique form of communication, aphasia can have profound adverse effects on one's quality of life. Although aphasia is more common in older populations, it can occur at any age, and many people with aphasia want to find ways to return to their premorbid lifestyles, including active careers, to the extent that this is possible. Clearly, there is a need for effective clinical tools to diagnose and treat aphasia, but a third factor makes the possibility of meeting this need a reality: More than 30 years of rehabilitation research provides strong evidence that even in chronic stages of aphasia, behavioral interventions lead to improved language function and changes in neural activity of cortical areas known to support language. This project aims to translate a theory-driven and empirically supported diagnostic battery for aphasia (Temple Assessment of Language and Short-term memory in Aphasia, TALSA) to a clinically feasible test battery that can be used for screening or in-depth measures of a language impairment. Importantly, the TALSA is based on a theoretical model of language that incorporates a role of verbal short-term memory (STM) in language processing. Language and verbal STM impairments commonly co-occur in aphasia, and this model attributes that co-occurrence to a common impairment of processes that support access and retrieval of words: weak activation and/or the inability to maintain activation of linguistic representations during word processing. This level of diagnosis is needed to guide impairment-based treatment approaches that directly stimulate access and retrieval processes. The TALSA is unique in that it includes language tests that add memory load and processing time, variables which are sensitive to these processing impairments.  The research version of the TALSA is administered on a computer but is lengthy and not practical in a clinical setting. Our aim is to develop a computerized adaptive test version for clinical use. This project will use a Milestone based approach to develop this innovative clinical tool. In the first two years, we will develop the clinical version using focus groups and item response theory to identify the best items and subtests to use in the clinical version of this test (Milestone 1). Goals to meet Milestone 2 will include (1) assessment of participating clinicians' views of current and best practices in aphasia rehabilitation and (2) training participating clinicians on the concepts behind the TALSA, as well as specifics about its administration and interpretation. Milestone 3 will involve implementation of the clinical version in the clinical settings and assessment of clinicians' responses to its usefulness and validation of the clinical version, in relation to the original version. Plans for dissemination of the final clinical version of the TALSA will include development of a secured website enabling access to the preliminary version (in Years 3-5) and arrangements for publication of the final version in Year 5."
"9388337","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of this project is to elucidate the cellular mechanisms by which the PDZ scaffolding protein NHERF1 regulates parathyroid hormone receptor (PTHR)-mediated signaling and function in bone. Mice with targeted deletion of NHERF1 exhibit a bone phenotype including an increased fracture rate, as do patients with NHERF1 mutations. We showed that these effects are a direct consequence of the absence or diminished abundance of NHERF1 in osteoblasts. It is not known how NHERF1 expression is regulated or how its conformations affect biological function. NHERF1 can assume open and closed conformations but it is unknown how these conformations are regulated or how they affect biological function. We demonstrate that vitamin D upregulates NHERF1 mRNA and protein in primary osteoblasts. Such an action could help explain the beneficial skeletal effects of vitamin D. Further, NHERF1 is a phospho-protein that assembles a macromolecular complex with the PTHR and ezrin. PTH-induced NHERF1 phosphorylation dissembles the PTHR-NHERF1-ezrin complex permitting PTHR endocytosis and termination of PTH action. The unifying hypothesis guiding this proposal is that the dual events of vitamin D stimulation of NHERF1 expression and of PTH-induced phosphorylation regulate the assembly and disassembly of functional NHERF1 macromolecular complexes. Three specific aims are developed to assess this idea. Aim 1 tests the hypothesis that vitamin D upregulates NHERF1 and defines the gene locus of this action; Aim 2 explores PTH-regulated NHERF1 phosphorylation and associated conformations; Aim 3 analyzes the proposition that by upregulating NHERF1 expression in intact mice, vitamin D increases membrane-delimited PTHR, thereby augmenting the effect of PTH on mineralization and bone growth. Biophysical, genetic, biochemical, and structural biological approaches will be applied to characterize these effects. Innovative chemical biological and genetic experiments along with high-content modeling will be performed. The outcomes will reveal new details of the regulation of osteoblast function and the role of NHERF1 in normal bone remodeling and in mineral bone disorder associated with chronic kidney disease (CKD-MBD). The results will help define potential therapeutic targets for improved treatment of osteoporosis and other metabolic bone diseases."
"9405848","Metabolic reprogramming is a hallmark of many cancers. First observed by Warburg, tumor cells switch from mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (MOP) to aerobic glycolysis (AG). AG is less energy efficient than MOP, but it appears to confer advantages to rapidly proliferating cells through formation of metabolic by- products that can be incorporated into membrane lipids, signaling molecules, amino acids and nucleotides. Enzymes that contribute to de novo lipogenesis, the synthesis of fatty acids from acetyl-CoA, have been shown to be overexpressed in a number of human cancers. Fatty acid synthase (FASN) catalyzes the synthesis of palmitic acid from acetyl-CoA and malonyl-CoA and in recent years has been shown ex v ivo to be overexpressed in cancers, including breast, prostate, colorectal and glioma, and to contribute to drug resistance. Overexpression of FASN is associated with a poor prognosis. As e xpression of FASN in normal tissue is very low, and FASN appears to play an i mportant role in tumor proliferation and malignancy, it has been proposed as a therapeutic target in various cancers. Inhibition of FASN has been shown to induce apoptosis, reduce tumor growth and impart chemosensitivity in multiple cancers including breast and prostate. Clinical diagnosis of prostate cancer involves prostate-specific antigen blood screening and biopsy. Patients are typically stratified according to clinical T-score, PSA count and Gleason score. At present, it remains difficult to distinguish between patients with aggressive and indolent forms of the disease, and new biomarkers for prostate cancer are necessary to better predict outcome and response to therapy. FASN has been proposed as a promising candidate biomarker, but its relevance has not been assessed in vivo by non-invasive means. Positron emission tomography (PET) imaging is a r apidly growing diagnostic field that enables the non- invasive study of disease. This project proposes to develop a small series of FASN inhibitors labeled with carbon-11 or fluorine-18 for imaging FASN expression in prostate cancer cell lines and mouse xenograft models. To assess FASN expression, a series of novel tracers labeled with 11C or 18F will be synthesized based on the most potent FASN inhibitors reported to date. To our knowledge this project represents the first attempt to study FASN expression via molecular imaging using inhibitors of the enzyme. If successful, this program will provide new radiolabeled probes to identify and quantify FASN expression in vivo using non-invasive PET imaging. This capability will provide a tool to study FASN biology, identify FASN positive tumors and identify patients who may benefit from anti-FASN therapy. Significant prognostic value may be attained by noninvasive monitoring of FASN expression during disease progression and over the course of therapeutic interventions. This is particularly intriguing in light of the recent reports of FASN therapies in tumor bearing animals and promising antitumor effects in early clinical trials."
"9418445","ABSTRACT The clinical use of pro-angiogenic growth factors could greatly impact the treatment of critical limb ischemia (CLI), a condition characterized by arterial blockages in the extremities. With CLI, 40% of patients are ineligible for available therapies and even with intervention, the 6-month risk of limb amputation is 25-40% with an annual mortality of 20%. In preclinical models of CLI, collateral blood vessel formation and perfusion restoration are observed in the ischemic limb following the administration of angiogenic growth factors. However, attempts at clinically translating these promising preclinical results, via the use of at-site or systemic injections of angiogenic growth factors, has remained a challenge. The delivery of growth factors via injection or using conventional scaffold-based approaches does not afford active control of the dose, timing, or spatial localization at the intended site of collateral vessel formation. Furthermore, no consensus exists regarding what range of these parameters, including what combination of growth factors, are required for effective therapeutic angiogenesis. Thus, there is an urgent need to develop a safe and effective delivery system for multiple angiogenic growth factors that recapitulates critical aspects of endogenous growth factor signaling and facilitates identification of these crucial parameters. Our long-term goal is to develop implantable biomaterials for the delivery of regenerative molecules, where delivery can be manipulated spatiotemporally in an externally-regulated, on-demand manner. The modulating mechanism is megahertz-range ultrasound, which is clinically translatable since it can be applied non-invasively, focused with sub-millimeter precision, and delivered in a spatiotemporally defined manner to sites deep within the body. The objective of this proposal is to develop an implantable scaffold where the released dose, sequence, and localization of two growth factors involved in angiogenesis - basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) and platelet derived growth factor-BB (PDGF- BB) - are non-invasively controlled. The scaffold, termed an acoustically-responsive scaffold (ARS), is doped with two ultrasound-sensitive emulsions that each contain a growth factor. The central hypothesis driving this project is that ultrasound can spatiotemporally pattern angiogenesis in and around an ARS by controlling the sequential release of bFGF and PDGF-BB. The rationale for the proposed research is that an ARS enables the study of how various doses and spatiotemporal gradients of bFGF and PDGF-BB affect the development of blood vessels, which can be used in the translation of therapeutic angiogenesis for the treatment of CLI. The hypothesis will be tested via three specific aims: 1) enhance selective release of growth factors from the ARS; 2) use an ARS to demonstrate the impact of spatiotemporally-generated gradients of bFGF on angiogenesis; and 3) demonstrate restoration of perfusion in a murine hind limb ischemia model using an ARS. Successful completion of the proposed research is significant since it will elucidate how microenvironmental factors ? such as growth factor doses, spatiotemporal profiles, and sequence ? affect angiogenesis."
"9445569","The usage of metabolic pathways is tailored to meet the specific functions and demands of a given cell type. Of particular interest is how metabolism supports the survival and antibody secretion of long-lived cells, the primary cell type that is responsible for humoral immunity. Using plasma cells as a model system, we will define how glucose and amino acid uptake supports long-term persistence of these antibody-secreting cells. In preliminary data, we demonstrate that long-lived plasma cells import far more glucose than do their short-lived counterparts. Glucose is primarily used to glycosylate antibodies, but a portion of this glucose can be used for glycolysis, and the resultant pyruvate imported into the mitochondria. Short-lived plasma cells do not have this capacity. We propose to define the metabolic fates of pyruvate and explain why this pathway is important in long-lived plasma cells. We also propose to define how long-lived plasma cells balance enhanced antibody production with nutrient uptake and ER stress. Finally, we seek to define the physiological signals that promote plasma cell metabolic programs following vaccination. The application heavily emphasizes new genetic and in vivo approaches to define, report, and functionally test critical metabolic pathways in a cell type critical for humoral immunity."
"9426249","Given the increasing evidence that RNA binding proteins (RBPs) serve as genetic causes or predisposing risk factors underlying a wide spectrum of neurological diseases, a pressing need exists to understand their specific cellular functions in developing and mature brains. Similar to transcription factors, RBPs could be master regulators of certain cellular processes owing to their coordinated target sets. Unlike widely-studied transcription factors, the physiological functions of RBPs are historically underexplored. Most of the dozen RBPs found to exhibit tissue-specific expression are involved in regulating neuronal alternative splicing. We and others have revealed the large-scale genetic programming of alternative splicing during embryonic brain development, resulting in neuron-specific alternative isoforms in mature brains. We show many of these splicing changes are mediated by a nuclear RBP, polypyrimidine tract-binding protein 2 (PTBP2). PTBP2 exhibits dynamic temporal expression during neuronal differentiation and may orchestrate the developmental programming of alternative splicing in order to accomplish the prolonged and continuous neuronal morphological transformations. Our previous study shows that downregulation of PTBP2 prior to synaptogenesis is necessary for spine formation. Our newest data show that PTBP2 has additional functions in early differentiating neurons prior to synapse formation. Guided by strong preliminary data, we hypothesize that PTBP2 governs neuron-specific splicing to control the initiation of neuronal polarity. This proposal will address multiple critical barriers to the study of neuronal polarity and provide a new framework for functional analysis of alternative splicing. Our long history of researching alternative splicing and PTBP2 in the brain places us in a unique position to advance these fields. Our team, with complementary expertise in genetics, neurobiology, and molecular cellular biochemical and computational biology, has demonstrated successful collaborations. We have generated new tools and resource to thoroughly determine the cellular and molecular defects caused by Ptbp2 knockout in cortical neurons. Completion of this project will allow us to further our long-term goal of revealing new genetic, molecular and cellular controls of neuronal polarity and morphogenesis that enables neural circuit formation."
"9437235","PROJECT SUMMARY Diseases of small joints such as arthritis and tendon abnormalities are prevalent, which leads to not only lasting patient suffering but also heavy healthcare cost. Musculoskeletal ultrasound imaging is an invaluable tool for diagnosing these diseases. However, current rigid and planar ultrasound probes have limited contact area with the highly curved irregular surfaces of the small joints, which leads to poor acoustic coupling and limited sonographic window. Also, the rigid probes require experienced professionals to scan the joints back and forth, with different scanning positions and orientations, which is labor-intensive and time-consuming. In addition, this causes anisotropic artifacts in the acquired images and is thus highly operator-dependent. In this project, a thin and soft ultrasound probe is proposed to allow conformal and intimate integration with the small joints for comprehensive, rapid, and artifact-free examinations. The approach is to explore an innovative ?island-bridge? structure that integrates an array of high performance rigid ultrasound transducers with an elastomeric polymer matrix, so mechanical properties of the resulting system will be similar to those of the human skin. Advanced imaging processing algorithm based on phased-array control mechanism will be developed. The acquired images will be high resolution in both axial and lateral dimensions. The final device will be tested on cadaver finger joints, and the collected results will be verified with these from conventional ultrasound probes. The soft ultrasound probes may suggest a transformative technology that holds promise for the next generation of wearable diagnostic devices for the small joints.     "

"9425498","Project Summary Glioblastoma, the deadliest form of brain cancer, is defined by the invasive nature of its cells. Invasion in the brain follows distinctive routes that correlate with interstitial and bulk flow pathways. In brain cancer, increased interstitial fluid flow develops due to the increase in interstitial pressure in the tumor bulk interfacing with the relatively normal pressure of the surrounding brain tissue, or tumor microenvironment. This differential leads to fluid transport specifically across the invasive edge of the tumor where cells are prone to both interact with the surrounding brain tissue and to evade localized, transport-limited therapies. To examine how interstitial fluid flow affects the invasion of brain cancer cells, we have developed in vitro and in vivo methods to examine fluid flow responses. In vitro, we have found that interstitial flow enhances invasion of brain cancer cells using both cell lines and patient-derived glioma stem cells in tissue-engineered models of the brain-tumor interface via the chemokine/receptor pair CXCL12/CXCR4. In vivo, we have seen interstitial flow and increase invasion of implanted cancer cells through the brain in part through this same mechanism. By conducting in vivo measurements of interstitial flow using MRI we have correlated regions of interstitial fluid flow, glioma invasion, and glial gene expression of the receptor sphingosine-1-phosphate 3. In this proposal, we will examine the role of interstitial fluid flow as a driving factor of glioma invasion. To make a case for the importance of interstitial flow in regulating GBM invasion first, we will elucidate the true nature of interstitial flow in the in vivo GBM microenvironment. We will accomplish this utilizing clinically relevant imaging and computational tools to probe the prevalence of flow as the tumor develops, and determine regions in which flow is the highest. Second, we will determine the contributions of interstitial flow at the level of cancer cell invasion. We will observe invasion patterns of multiple patient-derived glioblastoma stem cells in the specifically interrogating the mechanism of CXCR4/CXCL12-mediated autologous chemotaxis, a novel mechanism of invasion only possible under flow. Finally, we will use our unique ability to tissue engineer the glioblastoma microenvironment to examine the role of glial-expressed S1PR3 under flow on glioma invasion. Altogether, these reports will advance the importance and strategies for mitigating interstitial flow and its effects in GBM and offer modalities by which to study further effects of flow on therapeutic response. Understanding the impact of interstitial flow will ultimately help predict areas of GBM progression and recurrence."

The program will comprise a partnership between Duke University, the University of North Carolina, and North Carolina Central University (the nation?s first liberal arts college founded for African Americans) to enhance the diversity of the clinical research workforce, thereby ensuring that health concerns of underrepresented minorities remain a part of the national research agenda. Students will be exposed to a hands-on research experience that will encourage future research careers, and they will obtain career development tools to foster professional success. The program will expand and complement NIH-sponsored training resources already in place at Duke University under the leadership of the principal investigators, Dr. Kevin Thomas and Dr. Vivian Chu. This leadership structure synergistically combines scientific expertise and connections in cardiovascular disease (Dr. Thomas) with clinical research and career development curriculum expertise (Dr. Chu). In addition, the Duke Clinical Research Institute (DCRI) offers formal educational and support programs for junior faculty, fellows, residents, medical students, undergraduates, and high school students, with funding from internal DCRI resources as well as the NIH. The proposed program represents a unique piece in a continuum of NIH-supported training at the DCRI that runs the gamut from the high school-level to mid-career faculty. While the proportion of gap-year students is increasing, there are limited opportunities for these students to engage in a meaningful, career development experience. This program will be ideally positioned to fill this need using an established educational infrastructure with a track record of successful trainees. The program will take place over 6 months. Each participant will be paired with a senior Duke faculty mentor and will be integrated into the work of the mentor?s team for a collaborative research experience. Participants will work on an individual scholarly project, which will be original and hypothesis-driven. For the first 3 weeks of the program, trainees will work with their faculty mentors to develop a solid knowledge base of a specific clinical question based on a thorough review of the literature. During weeks 4-22, the trainees will develop a 6- page thesis consisting of a description of the research question, specific aims, methods, and figures/tables for the study. Throughout the program, didactics will focus on clinical research methods, research ethics, and writing skills and will be taught by Duke faculty and a dedicated medical writer. Trainees will work with their mentors throughout the course of the program to review their progress and the scientific validity of their work. At the conclusion of the program, trainees will present the results of their work to the faculty and staff at the DCRI. Finally, trainees will be followed for 10 years using a web-based database to assess the effectiveness of the training program. The proposed program will result in an improved, more diverse pipeline of future scientists whose practical experience in clinical research will facilitate their entry into research careers."
"9393321","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Like many neural circuits of the brain, the retina is composed of a network of cells with greatly varying anatomical and physiological properties. The most diverse types of cells, both in the retina and cortex, are inhibitory interneurons. Retina amacrine cells comprise over thirty types and influence the responses of ganglion cells, the output cells of the retina. Although the anatomy and physiology of amacrine cells have long been studied, there is little understanding as to whether they have specific and distinct roles, rather than each serving a similar, general function. A substantial barrier to the understanding of inhibitory interneurons has been technical limitations on studying single cells among a diverse population. This proposal seeks to characterize the population of inhibitory amacrine cells using a novel approach to optically record the visual responses of the amacrine cell population while simultaneously recording populations of ganglion cells using an electrode array.  This project focuses on responses to moving visual stimuli, which are ecologically important and critical to behavior and perception. The first aim of this proposal will measure the responses of a nearly complete amacrine population to moving stimuli and compare these with simultaneously recorded responses in the ganglion cell population. By measuring the similarity in responses between amacrine and ganglion cell populations, these experiments will test the hypothesis that amacrine cells are divided into two broad classes: one that resembles the more simple bipolar cell representation and one that is more tightly correlated with specific retinal ganglion cells. Te second aim of this proposal uses optical imaging and simultaneous intracellular and multielectrode recording to test the hypothesis that amacrine cells inhibit ganglion cells that the are correlated with under visual motion, despite the wide variation of preferred visual stimuli across amacrine cells. Finally, the third aim of this proposal will take advantage of our novel approach of directly perturbing individual interneurons intracellularly to test whether many types of amacrine cells act to reduce correlations in the ganglion cell population for different types of natural stimuli, thus creating an efficient representation of the visual scene.  These studies will not only add to the knowledge of how an inhibitory population represents and transforms visual information, but will also test general principles applicable to all neural circuits. The results wll have immediate applicability to the emerging field of retinal prostheses. The objective of a retinal prosthesis system is to treat prevalent diseases such as age-related macular degeneration and retinitis pigmentosa by replacing the function of the damaged retina with a high-resolution electronic circuit. Measurements of the retinal neural code and the computations that are performed will be directly useful for incorporation into these prostheses systems."

We eluted peptides from wild-type C57BL/6 and DO-knockout thymus, and found alterations in the spectrum of peptides presented by MHCII molecules. We examined CD4 T cell development in DO-deficient mice, and found alterations in Treg number and function, and increased sensitivity to viral infection. The overarching hypothesis of this proposal is that DO regulates antigen presentation by restraining the peptide editing activity of DM in order to allow a broad representation of peptides presented at the cell surface, and this activity is essential for proper thymic selection of self-tolerant conventional and regulatory T cells. There are two specific aims. Aim 1 is to evaluate the role of DO-dependent antigen presentation in selection of CD4 Tconv and Treg populations. We will identify peptides differentially presented in the thymus in the presence or absence of DO, follow individual TCR clonotypes as they undergo thymic selection in WT and DO-KO TCR-restricted mice, combine these results to identity DO-peptides responsible for Treg skewing, and finally characterize functional effects of Treg dysregulation in DO-KO mice. These experiments will test the hypothesis that narrowing of the peptide repertoire presented by MHCII molecules induced by deletion of DO results in altered thymic selection and peripheral regulation of regulatory T cells. Aim 2 is to determine the role of HLA-DO / H2-O in regulating Tconv and Treg populations in an infection model. We will evaluate the functional consequences of DO-induced changes in the TCR repertoire and activation state of CD4 T cell populations in the response of BL/6 mice to primary influenza infection. Tregs have been shown previously to regulate CD4 and CD8 T cell responses and recruitment of innate effector cells, and we observe alterations in these effects in DO-KO mice, suggesting a dysregulation of Tregs in the absence of DO. We will test this hypothesis, using a FoxP3-DTR system to swap Treg compartments between mice. A second part of this aim is to evaluate the functional consequences of DO- induced alterations in antigen presentation and TCR repertoires using the influenza infection model. The long- term goals of this project are to define how control of DM-mediated peptide editing by DO regulates selection of self- and pathogen-derived peptides displayed on MHCII, and to decipher the impact of DO-regulated peptide presentation on the development and function of the CD4 T cell repertoire. 1"
"9453505","Previous work from our lab and others has revealed that T cell development, once thought to be completed within the thymic microenvironment, continues for several weeks after cells have left the thymus and entered the lymphoid periphery. We have developed a model that allows unambiguous identification of the youngest peripheral T cells (recent thymic emigrants or RTEs) from mice that carry a GFP transgene driven by the RAG2 promoter. Using these reporter mice, which enable the retrieval of live, untouched RTEs from unmanipulated mice, we have shown that RTEs occupy a phenotypically and functionally distinct transitional T cell compartment. Compared to their mature counterparts, RTEs encountering antigen in the absence of inflammation exhibit diminished proliferation, reduced cytokine production, reduced expression of early activation markers, and increased expression of genes associated with dampened function or anergy. Based on solid preliminary data, we hypothesize that metabolic reprogramming, which accompanies and fuels the switch from quiescent to activated T cells, is altered in RTEs and serves as the mechanistic basis for their unique immune function. The goal of our proposed experiments is to test this novel hypothesis and to generate data that will serve as the foundation for a new direction of investigation in the field of RTE biology. Our first aim is to characterize the metabolic phenotype of RTEs by determining whether they have an altered metabolic function relative to mature T cells, comparing the metabolic profiles of resting and activated CD4 and CD8 RTEs and mature T cells, dissecting the signals responsible for altered metabolic reprogramming in RTEs, and determining whether RTEs and mature T cells differ in their capacity for exhaustion in the context of an anti- tumor response. Our second goal is to determine the relevance of altered metabolic reprogramming to the distinct function of RTEs by investigating whether cell-extrinsic factors correct RTE metabolism and function and dissecting the causal relationship between an altered metabolic profile and RTE function."
"9443275","ABSTRACT Why do eukaryotic membrane proteins express so poorly in E. coli? This issue has created a significant barrier in the effort to study mammalian membrane protein structures. E. coli is the tried-and-true over- expression system for protein purification, which has made structural biology accessible to countless laboratories. Still, there are only a handful of eukaryotic membrane protein structures determined so far and the major reason for this is the lack of an economical and easy expression system like E. coli. If expression could be carried out in E. coli, then this would improve our ability to investigate mammalian membrane protein structures, especially in light of recent revolutionary developments in single-particle cryo-electron microscopy. There is ample evidence that eukaryotic membrane proteins do express in E. coli, but that in most cases the yields are incredibly low and it is uncertain if the protein is functionally folded. However, by tagging targets with GFP at the C-terminus, it is possible to observe single-molecule protein expression directly in E. coli by oblique-angle fluorescence microscopy using sensitive EM/CCD detectors. With this approach, we can determine if expression occurs in the membrane vs. the cytoplasm or inclusion bodies based on single-particle tracking to measure diffusion. Furthermore, isolation of vesicles from E. coli membranes allows for single- vesicle functional measurements even with low levels of expression. Thus, it is possible to study the remarkably low-levels of expression of eukaryotic membrane proteins in E. coli and interrogate whether the production of functionally folded protein can be optimized through genetic manipulation. One reason why eukaryotic sequences may fail is due to improper coding of co-translational folding, i.e. a hidden genetic code that couples the timing of translation with partitioning and folding in the lipid bilayer. On target systems, we will investigate changes in expression and function while comparing: (a) codon usage including E. coli optimized vs. native codons and conservation of rare codon clusters, (b) N-terminal protein sequences and (c) conservation of pause sites such as Shine-Dalgarno elements (prokaryotes) or Alu motifs (eukaryotes). For each of these variables, we will generate chimaeras between homologues that express and those that fail in order to identify which elements lead to successful expression. We will examine three distinct membrane protein families that already have structures for both prokaryotic and eukaryotic homologues: (i) the CLC family of Cl-/H+ transporters and Cl- channels, (ii) Aquaporin water channels and (iii) 7TM receptor family of membrane proteins, including GPCRs. Finally, we will design a standalone program that will allow for simple alignment of gene sequence, protein sequence and structural elements simultaneously. The end goal of this project is to develop an optimization algorithm that will allow any scientist to take a poorly expressing eukaryotic membrane protein in E. coli, and increase expression to yields that will facilitate biochemistry studies such as structure determination by cryo-EM."
"9591423","Project Summary Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a common, frequently fatal, neuromuscular disorder caused by mutations in the Survival of Motor Neuron 1 (SMN1) gene and, consequently, a paucity of the SMN protein. In humans, an almost identical copy gene, SMN2, is unable to fully compensate for loss of SMN1 owing to a splicing defect and thus an inability to express sufficient protein to stave off disease. In the two decades that we have researched SMA much progress has been made, from the identification of the disease gene and the description of its protein to the generation of pre-clinical models and, most recently, the approval of Spinraza, a promising drug that raises SMN levels and thus thwarts the inevitable paralysis and frequent death associated with SMA. While Spinraza, in particular, raises considerable optimism for SMA patients, significant challenges remain and, in our minds, stem from two crucial deficiencies. First, despite the milestones achieved, how low SMN protein evolves into the SMA phenotype, selectively triggering motor neuron death and preferentially disabling the neuromuscular system remains a singular mystery. This is especially perplexing considering SMN?s most widely-cited function of orchestrating the splicing cascade. Identifying mediators that provide a logical explanation for why splicing defects cause SMA or, uncovering additional, more disease-relevant SMN functions is therefore not only mechanistically but also therapeutically relevant. Second, while it is clear that administering Spinraza provides immediate benefit to patients, it is premature to make a determination of the long-term outcome of such treatment; the drug is selectively delivered to the CNS, raising questions about the effects of chronic low SMN in the periphery. Besides, the strategy of raising SMN appears inadequate in the symptomatic patient. Here we describe 3 related sets of experiments that address the deficiencies identified above. Aim 1 proposes to define disease-relevant mechanisms by exploiting a novel line of SMA mice in which early mortality, motor neuron loss and a severe phenotype are replaced by prolonged survival, intact motor neurons and a decidedly mild phenotype. We hypothesize that a spontaneous mutation in a chaperone protein that the mice express suppresses the SMA phenotype. We will confirm and extend this finding to determine how the chaperone modulates the effects of low SMN. In aim 2, we will examine the potential long- term adverse effects of persistently low levels of SMN in muscles of model mice expressing normal protein in the CNS. Such rodents represent a pre-clinical model of SMA patients administered Spinraza. We propose that chronic low SMN in skeletal muscle has profoundly serious consequences for the health of the tissue and contributes to the overall SMA phenotype. In aim 3, we will determine if the disease-causing effects of low SMN in muscle can nevertheless be mitigated upon restoring protein post-symptomatically. Reversing such defects will inform the manner in which current treatments may have to be modified to prove more potent. Our study thus addresses important mechanistic as well as clinical aspects of SMA."
"9607661","PROJECT SUMMARY This R03 proposal stems directly from studies and career development activities outlined in my current K01 award and represents a new research direction that will enhance my advancement towards independence. This award will allow me to obtain additional skills in combining genetic mouse models of disease with systems biology approaches in order to define novel mechanisms of autophagy regulation in the intestine and colon with direct relevance to Inflammatory Bowel Disease and colorectal cancer. This will be achieved with the guidance of my research mentor, Dr. Rustgi, my K01 interdisciplinary advisory committee of Drs. Wu (Chair), Kaestner, Lengner, and Lynch, as well as new collaborator Dr. Premal Shah. Autophagy is a mechanism by which cells adapt and survive in response to stress under certain conditions. During homeostasis, autophagy can be protective in the intestinal epithelium following acute injury, which is underscored by recent studies describing defective autophagy in Crohn's disease patients. Post-transcriptional regulation of intestinal epithelial homeostasis via RNA-binding proteins (RBPs), including IMP1 (IGF2 mRNA- binding protein 1=IMP1), represents a critical, acute layer of gene expression control through modulation of target transcript splicing, stability, localization and translation. Our preliminary data demonstrate phenotypic and functional alterations in the autophagy pathway in mice with intestinal epithelial cell (IEC)-specific deletion of Imp1 (Imp1?IEC), where autophagic flux is enhanced during homeostasis. Imp1?IEC mice exhibit enhanced regeneration following injury, which can be reversed with autophagy inhibition. RNP-immunoprecipitation (RIP) assays have unraveled specific autophagy transcripts bound by IMP1, previously unknown. These data support the scientific premise that IMP1 may normally suppress intestinal epithelial autophagy via direct biochemical binding. Despite these functional links between IMP1 and autophagy, it remains unknown whether high IMP1 expression directly downregulates autophagy and whether this could contribute to disease phenotypes in Crohn's patients. We will therefore test the hypothesis that intestinal epithelial IMP1 functions to suppress autophagy directly and promote susceptibility to inflammation-induced injury. Specifically, we will utilize our newly generated mouse model in which Imp1 is conditionally overexpressed in the intestine and colon epithelium (Imp1OE, OE=overexpression) combined with targeted and unbiased approaches (RNA-sequencing and ribosome profiling) to dissect the direct mechanism of autophagy regulation by IMP1. The long-term objective of these studies (to be achieved through future NIH R01 funding) is to understand fundamental intestinal epithelial biology via regulation of RNA-binding proteins and evaluate IMP1 as a new therapeutic target for enhancing autophagy in patients with defective autophagy (including Crohn's disease)."

Collectively, current and future planned studies would provide a diverse, creative, well-funded, and supportive research environment to train junior IM investigators."
"9434124","Title: DNA Responses in Wild-derived Mice A central scientific question of this proposal is understanding the mechanism of host responses to cytosolic DNA using genetic approach. We used evolutionary divergent wild derived mice of MOLF strain to map, identify and characterize novel mutations at the N-terminal domain (NTD) of STING, one of the main DNA-sensors and mediator of responses to DNA. These mutations confer low production of IFN in MOLF macrophages. Despite defective IFN-production, MOLF exhibit high levels of IL6 in response to DNA thus revealing the complexity of STING-mediated responses. The novelty of these studies in that i) they highlight for the first time functional importance of NTD of STING while recent studies focused exclusively on the C-terminal region of STING; ii) they describe novel model of DNA-response that is polarized from IFN towards other cytokines; iii) they show that the mutant allele is inherited in a dominant manner thus alluding to a possible mechanism of STING- mediated signal transduction; iv) they present evidence of other (novel) sensors of DNA that could be identified via unbiased genetic approach. Accordingly, our 2-aim plan addresses characterization of the mutant STING allele (Aim 1) and identification of other loci conferring DNA-responses in MOLF mice (Aim 2). Together, the Aims provide a comprehensive analysis of DNA responses in MOLF. Given our expertise and track record in mapping and positional cloning as well as broad knowledge of mechanisms of activation of innate immune responses, it is likely that we will find novel components of cytosolic DNA sensing pathway(s), which is very important in protection of the host against viruses and bacteria. Thus, the scientific impact of this proposal is defined by a possibility of identification of novel components regulating responses to host- and pathogen- derived DNA. Most importantly, the identification of these genes will be insightful for translational research relevant to human health. ! !"
"9591096","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Widespread antibiotic use continues to be a public health problem worldwide. In addition to driving development of antibiotic resistance, another consequence of antibiotic use has been an increase in Clostridium difficile infection (CDI), now the most common cause of nosocomial diarrhea. CDI results in significant morbidity and mortality with over 500,000 cases and 14,000 deaths due to CDI annually in the US alone. Antibiotics administered for other infections decrease the diversity of the normal gut microbiota resulting in a loss of gut colonization resistance which enables C. difficile, a toxin-producing anaerobic pathogen resistant to most antibiotics, to proliferate without having to compete with normal intestinal microbes. The microbial ecosystem of the intestine plays a critical protective role against CDI, well-illustrated by the high success rate reported for fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) for the treatment of recurrent CDI. However, while very successful, FMT is not a palatable procedure, concerns exist about donor transmission of infection, and mechanisms of action remain poorly understood.  To address these issues, we developed a defined Microbial Ecosystem Therapeutic (MET-1), prototype that we have already used successfully to cure two patients with recurrent C. difficile infection (CDI) that was refractory t all other antibiotic treatment. Consistent with the concept of a core microbiome that encompasses key functions required for normal intestinal homeostasis, Microbial Ecosystem Therapeutics, is a means of replacing a dysfunctional, damaged ecosystem with a healthy ecosystem. Now that we have demonstrated feasibility of the MET approach, the current application proposes to extend our studies, using novel methods of rational design, to develop new MET formulations to treat C. difficile infections caused by hypervirulent strains that do not respond to traditional antibiotics. We hypothesize that utilization of selected microbial communities will be effective at protecting the host against CDI. These formulations can be designed to be resilient enough to withstand further antibiotic insults and additional CDI relapse. Our overall objective is to optimize MET formulations based on rational design, and to determine the mechanisms whereby MET decreases the incidence and severity of CDI  In the R21 phase, we will develop new and improved MET formulations to treat CDI, using novel methods of rational design (Aim 1). Both the in vitro and in vivo readouts will be employed to test efficacy of the new MET formulations and to further investigate mechanism (Aim 2), using our MET-1 prototype as a comparator control. Once the defined milestones of the R21 grant are met, we plan to transition to an R33 phase to further develop the MET product into a FDA approved commercial product for the treatment of recurrent CDI. The focus of the R33 phase will be to create reliable manufacturing processes (Aim 3) and quality control systems (Aim 4) to ensure that the product being manufactured is consistent from batch to batch and to ensure that we have a product that will meet the standards required to submit an IND."
"9430997","Project Summary EoE is a newly recognized chronic, antigen driven allergic disease that causes tissue remodeling. Esophageal remodeling includes fibrosis and smooth muscle hypertrophy/dysfunction that leads to esophageal rigidity and dysmotility. Clinical symptoms include vomiting, poor growth, dysphagia, food impactions, and strictures. My patient oriented research (POR) program focuses on elucidating the mechanisms and clinical impacts of esophageal remodeling in children. Herein I propose to become an outstanding POR mentor to a diverse group of undergraduate/graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, and junior faculty trainees from multiple disciplines and to continue and extend my research to understanding EoE as a disease of both inflammation and ?mechanotransduction?. In the Research Plan, I test 3 hypotheses on the fundamental mechanisms of EoE. The first is a potentially paradigm shifting central hypothesis that a rigid matrix alters the function of esophageal fibroblasts and smooth muscle cells to propagate EoE together with, and independently of, inflammation. This has the clinical implication that there is a pressing, unmet clinical need for therapies that target inflammation- independent remodeling. The second hypothesis, an extension of my current POR, is that the adherens junction protein, E-cadherin, is pivotal in the loss of esophageal epithelial cell barrier function and that super resolution microscopy is a cutting-edge tool that will aid our understanding of the interaction between barrier function and E-cadherin localization at the nanometer level. The third aim is to evaluate gender differences in EoE severity with the hypothesis that male fibroblasts are intrinsically more biased to esophageal inflammation and remodeling. Together with my collaborators and our co-mentees, I have developed and utilized innovative primary human models that transition from single cells and intact multicellular and functional ex vivo human mucosal platforms to an in vivo analyses of esophageal rigidity and motility in children. With our large, well- phenotyped EoE population, we are able to continuously translate our findings back to the patient. I have involved mentees in each of my aims, developed a formal plan to train junior investigators in the lab, clinic and career path, created a formal mentoring plan and team for my mentees and myself, and integrated the unique resources at UCSD including the CTSA funded Clinical and Translational Research Institute. I have a strong record of funded POR and training mentees but require the protected time and further education to become the inspiring mentor I envision. This is an important goal for sustaining research and creating a legacy of investigators in eosinophilic gastrointestinal disorders (EGIDs). My past and current group of mentees are from Allergy/Immunology, Gastroenterology, and Bioengineering, all of whom are dedicated to, and united by, the singular goal of unraveling mechanisms of EGIDs and bringing the findings back to the patient. The combination of a multidisciplinary mentee team, an outstanding research and institutional environment, and a strong mentoring plan are key to the success of this proposal."
"9588860","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Metabolic disorders including obesity, dyslipidemia and diabetes appear to be associated with monocyte dysfunction, yet the molecular mechanisms underlying monocyte dysfunction in vivo are only poorly understood. Our recent studies showed that metabolic stress promotes the dysregulation and hyper-activation of monocyte responses to chemokines and that monocyte dysfunction is a critical and rate-limiting step in the development and progression of atherosclerosis. We have now found that dietary supplementation with ursolic acid, a triterpenoid with anti-inflammatory properties, attenuate monocyte dysfunction and macrophage recruitment and protects diabetic mice from atherosclerosis. In addition, we have elucidated key steps in a novel mechanism through which hypercholesterolemia and hyperglycemia promote monocyte dysfunction, and have identified several novel potential targets for the anti-atherogenic and anti-inflammatory activity of ursolic acid and its analogues. Based on these data, we hypothesize that ursolic acid protects against monocyte dysfunction and atherosclerosis by preventing metabolic stress-induced protein-S-glutathionylation, inactivation and degradation of mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatases (MKP) in monocytes. To test our hypothesis and to identify both the structural features of ursolic acid responsible for the anti- atherogenic properties and the molecular mechanisms involved in monocyte protection, we propose two Specific Aims: Specific Aim 1: To determine the protective mechanisms through which ursolic acid and its analogues prevent monocyte dysfunction induced by metabolic stress. Specific Aim 2: To determine the mechanism by which dietary ursolic acid and its analogues protect against atherosclerosis.

"9379808","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     The VA recognizes pain as the 5th vital sign in healthcare delivery, encouraging advancements in the assessment and management of pain in Veterans. Due to both ongoing military conflicts and common chronic diseases such as diabetes, a growing number of Veterans are living with amputations. Among this group, many report a phenomenon called phantom limb pain, a form of pain experienced in the amputated limb of the Veteran that is often chronic, debilitating, and resistant to standard biomedical pain therapies. Developing effective alternative treatments for phantom limb pain can potentially improve the quality of life and functional status of these Veterans. In a previous VA-funded clinical trial, this team of investigators completed the first comparativeness effectiveness study for phantom limb pain that evaluated mirror therapy, a behavioral treatment with promise for the treatment of phantom limb pain. In the current proposal, we aim to advance mirror therapy to the next stage of development by developing an immersive virtual reality treatment that incorporates the effective components of standard mirror therapy while also addressing the known weaknesses of mirror therapy. For example, in standard mirror therapy, only patients with unilateral amputations can perform the exercises and the person needs to carry the mirror in order to perform the therapy. Using a virtual reality platform, we can circumvent these limitations by immersing Veterans in a highly portable simulated environment in which they can perform mirror therapy exercises irrespective of amputation pattern. We will also address important questions about the relative benefits of virtual reality treatments for pain in this study. At present, it is unknown if it is te nonspecific elements of virtual reality that produce pain reduction benefits or if it is more speciic features of the virtual reality environment. We will evaluate these questions using a protocol in which patients are randomized to either the virtual reality equipment over one month treatment periods or to a matched standard behavioral mirror therapy treatment. The objective of this two year study is to develop an develop a portable and user friendly virtual reality treatment platform for treating phantom limb pain and evaluating its feasibility among a group of Veterans."

"9421467","PROJECT SUMMARY Neonatal stroke is an important cause of death and disability, resulting from multiple pathways of cell death and dysfunction that evolve over a prolonged period of time. There is insufficient knowledge regarding the role of angiogenesis in the response to focal ischemia-reperfusion injury that is the most common cause of early stroke. Angiogenesis and neuronal repopulation occur in close proximity, with paracrine factors supporting neuron-endothelial cell interactions that are critical for repair. Modulating this neurovascular niche may be a potential target for enhancing outcomes after ischemic brain injury in the newborn period. Cell-based therapies have emerged as a promising treatment for CNS disease, although the mechanism of repair has been controversial. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) play a role in vascular formation and secrete pro-angiogenic factors, express a number of growth factor receptors, and may preferentially differentiate into cells capable of building new blood vessels after injury. MSC treatment has been shown to improve histological and functional outcomes after ischemic injury, even when therapy was delayed, but it is only partially reparative. Modifying MSC in a way that enhances effects on the neurovascular unit may provide additional benefit. Our overall objective is to determine the mechanism of regeneration and repair with delayed cellular therapy for neonatal stroke by focusing on the vascular response in the injured brain. In Aim 1, we will test the hypothesis that MSC pre-exposed to EPO will enhance angiogenesis and vascular remodeling following neonatal focal ischemia-reperfusion injury in the rat more than MSC or EPO therapy alone. In Aim 2, we will clarify to what extent this modified cellular therapy modulates long-term repair by using a number of techniques to quantify cell fate, gross histology and long-term sensorimotor and cognitive outcomes. Finally, in Aim 3, we will define the roles of specific downstream signaling pathways on angiogenesis and repair following ischemia- reperfusion injury and cellular therapy. This will determine critical, modifiable pathways important for angiogenesis in the developing brain and following focal injury, which can be further studied to enhance long- term repair. Our primary hypothesis is that delayed treatment with MSC pretreated with EPO will promote vascular growth and remodeling, increase neurogenesis, and improve long-term histological and functional outcomes after neonatal stroke. This will provide a late treatment option for a common cause of early brain injury, where diagnosis is often delayed."
"9388989","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Type 1 diabetes (T1D) results from a complex cascade of events that breaks immune tolerance and culminates in the destruction of islet ß cells. B lymphocytes (B cells) play a critical role in disease. This project focuses on the role ofa central B cell signaling protein, Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK). We have defined the role of BTK in supporting autoreactive B cells that present antigen to autoreactive T cells, and shown that BTK can be targeted to protect against development of T1D. We now extend those findings to mucosal immunity, and have discovered that BTK-deficient nonobese diabetic (NOD) mice have greatly reduced numbers of Peyer's Patch B cells, important for production of IgA. Accordingly, IgA is also reduced. We therefore tested the hypothesis that IgA in gut mucosa selects the resident microbes. Genetic sequencing of intestinal microbiota showed that Btk-/-/NOD mice have strikingly altered microbial populations compared with wild type NOD mice. Furthermore, exposure to different microbes in the neonatal period abrogated disease protection in Btk-/-/NOD mice.  The hypothesis underlying this proposal is that B cell signaling via BTK supports production of IgA, which shapes a microbiome that promotes T1D in genetically susceptible hosts. To understand BTK contributions to the microbiome in relationship to T1D, we propose to: 1) determine the mechanisms by which BTK regulates the microbiome, by using cell-specific targeted deletion to define the effects on gut immune structures including Peyer's Patches. The impact of BTK actions on IgA production and gut immune responses will be investigated and effects of BTK inhibitors on mucosal immunity assessed, 2) determine the kinetics of BTK-targeting in modifying the microbiome. The developmental stages from neonate to adult when the microbiome is sensitive to the functions of BTK will be identified. Timed excision of BTK or drug administration will assess the potential to halt the progression of T1D in the NOD model and determine if microbiome modification is required for a successful outcome. Experiments will also determine how reconstitution with PP B cells affects microbial modification and disease outcome, and 3) determine disease contributions of the microbiome that is supported by BTK. Btk-/-/NOD mice will be rederived into a germ-free facility to separate autoimmune disease effects of BTK-signaling from that of the microbiome. Fecal transfer will be used to directly test microbiome contributions to T1D.  This project has direct clinical importance in understanding how BCR-signaling supports the selection of commensal flora that influences the outcome of T1D as a necessary step in developing therapeutic interventions."

"9552457","Sirt-1-mediated regulation of NeuroAIDS In the post anti-retrovirals (ART) era, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection is no longer a deadly condition. Rather, HIV+ individuals age with the chronic infection. Therefore, the consequences of HIV infection overlap and synergize with normal senescence in various organs, especially the brain. It is accepted that HIV infection triggers in the Central Nervous System (CNS) several hallmarks of aging, such as cognitive and motor disorders and dementia, regardless of CD4 levels1. However, the molecular aspects underlining this accelerated aging process in HIV-infected brains are poorly understood. Here, using the non-human primate model of neuroAIDS, SIV infection of rhesus macaques, we will provide preliminary evidence that the infection triggers molecular markers that were previously associated to aging in humans. We propose to explore the hypothesis that the virus causes a disruption of an epigenetic pathway that regulates aging and lifespan, which can be responsible for enhancing molecules that aggravate the inflammatory phenotype associated with CNS functional decay, ultimately represented by encephalitis. In this proposal we will address an important problem of how HIV promotes a rapid aging of the brain though a potential dysregulation of transcription, centered and orchestrated by the levels and function of Sirt-1, which is a molecule with profound implications to lifespan and in aging models. We studied the dynamics of Sirt-1 binding to chromatin in microglia from control and SIV-infected macaques, and identified a network of genes regulated by Sirt-1. Narrowing our analysis to in-promoter Sirt-1 binding sites, we generated a list of molecules that may have a critical role in the development of an inflammatory phenotype in the brain. In this application, we aim at examining the role of this network of molecules in depth, integrating CNS dysfunction and age, to understand the molecular and mechanistic basis for deep changes in the inflammatory environment that are common to aging and to HIV infection, and that synergize to aggravate neurological syndromes, even in the post- ART era."

"9443994","Summary Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) is an aggressive disease with few survivors. Progression of pancreatic oncogenesis requires immune-suppressive inflammation in cooperation with oncogenic mutations. However, the drivers of tumor-promoting inflammation in PDA are poorly understood. Dectin-1 is a member of the C-type Lectin family of pattern recognition receptors and is required for the innate immune response to fungal pathogens. However, Dectin-1 does not have an established role in sterile inflammation or in promoting oncogenesis. Non-pathogen- derived Dectin-1 ligands have not been well-characterized. Our preliminary data showed that Dectin-1 in highly expressed in both the inflammatory and epithelial compartments in PDA in mice and humans. Moreover, Dectin-1 ligation accelerated PDA development whereas Dectin-1 deletion was protective. Further, we discovered that Galectin-9, a lectin with affinity for ?-galactosides, is ubiquitous within the PDA tumor microenvironment and avidly ligates Dectin-1. Mechanistically, we found that Dectin-1 signaling in tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) induces their reprogramming into immune-suppressive M2-like macrophages leading to Th2 and Treg differentiation of CD4+ T cells in vivo. Based on these data, we postulate that Dectin-1 ligation of Galectin-9 is a pivotal switch which drives immune-suppression in the pancreatic TME. In Aim 1 we will determine the consequences of Dectin-1 activation in PDA and test whether targeting Dectin-1 or Galectin-9 are protective and extend survival in diverse murine models of PDA. We will also determine the specific compartment (epithelial vs inflammatory) in which Dectin-1 signaling is oncogenic. In Aim 2 we will test our overriding hypothesis is that Dectin-1 signaling in myeloid cells induces the differential expansion of immune-suppressive macrophage subsets which have the proclivity to generate pro-tumorigenic T cells leading to tumor-permissive anergy. We also will delineate the biochemical mechanism of Dectin-1-dependant adaptive immune anergy in PDA and test our translational hypothesis that targeting Dectin-1 will have synergistic efficacy with checkpoint-receptor directed immunotherapeutic regimens. Collectively, Aim 2 will define the cellular and biochemical mechanisms of Dectin- 1 promotion of PDA and provide guidance for the development of novel strategies for experimental therapeutics. Aim 3 will be dedicated to elucidating the immune-suppressive effects of Dectin-1 signaling in human PDA and studying the implications of the Dectin-1?Galectin-9 axis on suppression of adaptive immunity and clinico- pathologic disease features and outcome in patients. We anticipate that Dectin-1 activation via Galectin-9 is a principal driver of immune-suppressive myeloid cell programming in PDA leading to CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell anergy. We believe our work has high translational value and will suggest that Dectin-1 and Galectin-9 may be attractive targets for experimental therapy in patients. Moreover, this work is likely to have far-reaching implications for a role for Dectin-1 in other cancer subtypes and in sterile inflammation."
"9450759","Project Summary / Abstract  Encoding of environmental location and navigational behavior in mammals involves large ensembles of specific neuron types across multiple interacting brain regions. ?Place cell? and ?grid cell? mapping of spatial location in the CA1 region of hippocampus and medial entorhinal cortex (EC), respectively, is thought to be fed forward to associative cortical brain regions including the posterior parietal cortex (PPC) and retrosplenial cortex (RSP) to map conjunctions of egocentric and external spatial relationships. This notion implies that the hippocampal-neocortical pathway involves a gradual transformation of spatial cognition to action along with encoding of specific route information at intermediate processing stages. While the characterization of this hippocampal feedforward output to the neocortical system has been conceptually useful for our understanding of spatial navigation processes, it is now time to consider the role of the largely unexplored ?top-down? neocortical inputs from RSP to the hippocampus. The subiculum (SUB) is an under-investigated brain structure well positioned to mediate circuit interactions between the hippocampal and neocortical systems. Based on our recent discoveries, we hypothesize that specific subsets of SUB neurons receive significant direct ?top-down? inputs from RSP and that these inputs yield specialized SUB encoding of multiple spatial relationships including the axis of travel, boundary vectors, and route sub-spaces. These SUB neurons are expected to overlap with the population of CA1-projecting SUB neurons that exert direct feedback regulation of hippocampus-associated spatial mapping and learning. We propose to study the synaptic circuit organization and functional implications of this ?top-down? pathway from RSP cortex, to SUB, to hippocampal CA1, using recent technological advancements. To test the hypothesis, in Aim 1, we will map brain-wide circuit input connections of CA1-projecting SUB neurons and compare these to EC-projecting, and RSP-projecting SUB neurons using new viral tracing and optogenetic stimulation mapping. A combinatorial viral and genetic strategy will be used to selectively label projection-specific SUB neurons for circuit studies and physiological characterization. In Aims 2 and 3, we will link circuit connection mapping to neurophysiological function and behavior. Tetrode recordings and in vivo GCaMP6-based calcium imaging of CA1 at single-cell resolution in freely moving animals will resolve how RSP inputs and projection-specific SUB neurons modulate CA1 place cell activities and how they contribute to spatial learning and navigation. The studies will be conducted in conjunction with behavioral analyses addressing how animals learn object-place associations and routes through environments having multiple interconnected pathways. Genetically targeted neuronal inactivation will be used to establish the causality of circuit connections and function. The proposed studies are aligned with the specified goals of Targeted Brain Circuits Projects, and will contribute to a mechanistic understanding of how dynamic patterns of specific SUB neural activity are transformed into spatial navigation and cognition."
"9444220","The primary focus of this research proposal will be the identification, discovery, and elucidation of novel biochemical pathways for the metabolism of complex carbohydrates in the human gut microbiome. Currently, more than one thousand different bacterial species have been identified in the human intestinal tract and the total number of genes contained within these bacteria exceeds the number of human genes by more than two orders of magnitude. Moreover, it has been demonstrated that the composition of the human gut microbiome and the associated metabolic diversity contained within these bacteria contribute significantly to the maintenance of human health and physiology. Unfortunately, a significant fraction of the enzymes and corresponding metabolic pathways contained within the bacteria found in the human gut have an uncertain, unknown, or incorrect functional annotation. This uncertainty suggests that a substantial fraction of the metabolic potential contained within the human gut microbiome remains to be properly characterized. Our proposed experimental approach for the discovery and elucidation of novel metabolic pathways for the metabolism of complex carbohydrates will involve the concerted and synergistic utilization of bioinformatics, computational biology, three-dimensional protein structure determination, metabolomics and physical screening of focused compound libraries. The determination of the substrate and reaction diversity contained within the newly discovered enzyme-catalyzed reactions will provide unique insights into the molecular mechanisms for the evolution and development of novel enzymatic activities and will provide potential targets for therapeutic intervention."
"9453149","The colonic microbiome has been implicated in colorectal cancer (CRC) pathogenesis but the exact mechanisms underlying these observations remain incompletely understood. We have observed striking associations between specific host microbes and aberrant DNA methylation in CRC. For example, Fusobacterium species are substantially enriched in cancers affected by the CpG Island Methylator Phenotype (CIMP). Preliminary data based on sequencing and qPCR validation also show enrichment of bacteria that have been linked to disease in humans or mouse models (E.coli sp., Klebsiella sp. etc.). High levels of these pathogenic bacteria are associated with recurrences in CIMP+ colon cancers. This unexpected link between colonic microbiota and epigenetic control was also seen in an analysis of DNA methylation genome wide in the colonic mucosa of germ free (GF) mice compared to conventionalized mice, where we found that reintroduction of bacteria led to hypermethylation of normally unmethylated CpG island sites (the main anomaly seen in CIMP+ cases). Thus, our preliminary data support a new hypothesis, that the GI microbiota affects colonic neoplasia through inducing or modulating aberrant DNA methylation and epigenetic control. Mechanistically, we propose that multiple parallel mechanisms may be contributing to this link including DNA damage associated recruitment of silencing complexes, and metabolic disturbances whereby bacteria secrete metabolites and/or toxins that diffuse into colonic epithelial cells and affect DNA methylation directly (e.g. 2-hydroxyglutarate [2-HG], which inhibits the TET DNA demethylase enzymes) or indirectly (e.g. butyrate, which is known to modulate epigenetics through inhibition of histone deacetylases). To test these hypotheses, we propose three specific aims: (1) Define the microbiome across the spectrum of CIMP+ tumors. We will use 16S RNA genomic sequencing in an extensive tumor (cancer, precursors and adjacent normal) set simultaneously characterized for CIMP, mutations and gene expression. (2) Impact of CIMP+ associated bacteria on tumorigenesis and DNA methylation in mice. GF Il10-/-;Apcmin/+ mice will be colonized with bacterial candidates (e.g. E.coli, F.nucleatum, K.pneumonia) and tumor incidence, severity, survival as well as DNA methylation and gene expression in normal and tumor tissues will be evaluated. We will also test whether drugs targeting DNA methylation are effective in prevention of bacteria-associated tumorigenesis. (3) Study metabolites by which bacteria influence DNA methylation profiles. We will use metabolomics on cultures of bacteria associated with CIMP and on lysates from CIMP+ and CIMP- cancers to identify metabolites that potentially modulate DNA methylation. These (e.g. 2HG, butyrate) will be tested for effects on DNA methylation (in cell culture and in GF mice) and tumorigenesis (in mice). The proposed research tests a new mechanism for microbiome-associated tumorigenesis and has important implications for detection, prevention and treatment of CRCs."
"9594436","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Progress in neural recording is critical to understanding the brain and developing treatments for brain disorders. Current neural recordings can, at best, capture a few hundred interacting neurons. The number of recorded neurons is relatively small because current neural recording devices, such as electrodes, amplifiers, lasers, and cameras, are macroscopic. The objective of our research is to create neural recorders at the molecular scale, by writing neural activities onto DNA, like a molecular ticker tape. The device will consist of an engineered DNAP polymerase that can be cheaply synthesized and easily delivered to neurons, where it will write the temporal dynamics of activity of each neuron onto local DNA molecules, which can later be analyzed via increasingly cheap genome sequencing technologies. The long term goal of our research is to enable a paradigm shift, making recording instrumentation-free, easy to use, and scalable to arbitrary numbers of neurons. We will obtain the nanoscale recording device using three pipelines: (1) Polymerase design pipeline. We will search through different DNA polymerases to find a polymerase that makes many replication mistakes when ion concentrations increase, and thus when neurons are active. We will use directed protein engineering to add ion-sensitive domains. Lastly we will use high throughput protein directed evolution, to produce a polymerase with desirable properties. (2) Template design pipeline. We will design and deliver an engineered DNA template to the cell to be copied. We will utilize transfection, which is feasible but might not be convenient in some neuroscientific experiments, moving later towards viral template delivery methods, which may be simpler. (3) Statistics pipeline. The resulting DNA sequences need to be converted back into signals of neurobiological meaning. Such conversion needs to be precise, robust to various problems such as biological polymerase noise, and error-correcting. The approach is innovative, because it reinvents the concept of recording using molecular engineering to produce a device that is orders of magnitude smaller and arguably more versatile than comparable devices. The proposed research is significant, because it allows a whole range of new electrophysiological experiments. The approach will complement other emerging approaches that promise to lead to large dataset based neuroscience, e.g. connectomics. The resulting technique will be easyto- use and inexpensive, yet will promise to allow recording simultaneously from potentially arbitrary numbers of neurons, with temporal precision comparable to existing state-of-the-art calcium imaging. It promises massively increased amounts of neural data and entirely new approaches to asking deep questions about the way the brain works and how to cure disease of the brain."

"9426526","Abstract  Ischemic stroke is a leading cause of death and long-term disability. Current drug treatment is limited to tPA, which has a low success rate and potentially severe side effects. Acidosis is a common feature of neurological disorders such as brain ischemia, and it has been shown to play a critical role in stroke. The mechanisms, however, remained elusive. The discovery that protons activate a distinct family of cation channels, the acid-sensing ion channels (ASICs), has shed new light on acid-signaling and acidosis-mediated brain injury. The studies in our laboratories in the past 10 years have provided convincing evidence suggesting that activation of ASIC1a contributes markedly to acidosis-mediated ischemic brain injury. Following our initial report, others have demonstrated an important role for ASIC1a activation in spinal cord injury, traumatic brain injury, and axon degeneration. Thus, ASIC1a represents a novel therapeutic target. Despite its well-established role in neurological disorders, the detailed mechanisms underlying ASIC1a-mediated neuronal injury in stroke remain unclear. We now have strong evidence suggesting that, besides the well-documented Ca2+ toxicity, a combination of increased ASIC1a surface expression, Zn2+ toxicity, and an ion conducting independent cell death pathway participate in ASIC-mediated neuronal injury in ischemia. The objective of this application is to investigate the detailed molecular mechanisms and pathways underlying ASIC-mediated neuronal injury. Given the limitations of currently available pharmacological inhibitors that target these channels, e.g. the non-specificity of amiloride and large molecule nature of PcTX1, the proposed studies may disclose novel and alternative therapeutic strategies for ischemic brain injury."

"9448313","7. Project Summary/Abstract Myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) are chronic blood disorders that that can cause severe symptoms and early death. New treatments have become available recently that help ameliorate symptoms, but they do not reliably slow or halt disease progression. We seek to better understand what drives disease development and progression in MPNs, so that we can develop better therapies for patients with these diseases. Our preliminary data indicates that a signaling pathway called the NFkB pathway is abnormally activated in MPNs. We hypothesize that this pathway contributes to the development and progression of MPNs. Therefore, we have proposed a combination of mouse and human studies to determine how the NFkB pathway contributes to MPN pathogenesis, and to evaluate whether inhibition of NFkB signaling may have potential therapeutic benefits for MPN patients."
"9445329","Project Summary  There is growing evidence that non-smokers who were exposed to second-hand smoke (SHS) are at an increased risk of mild cognitive impairment (MCI), often a preclinical form of dementia. Patients with MCI have a significantly higher rate of exposure to SHS than dementia patients and most MCI patients eventually develop dementia. Environmental factors ranging from previous head trauma to educational level to one's early life experiences (e.g., altered brain growth and development), including exposure to toxins through the diet (e.g., nitrosamines) or by inhalation (e.g., cigarette smoke), are major risk factors for the sporadic forms of dementia. It is becoming increasingly clear that environmental factors play an important role in the etiology of dementia, but which of them is poorly understood. SHS might be an important environmental trigger of MCI and dementia. Studies that focus on exploring the influence of SHS on cognitive function and the underlying metabolic processes could advance understanding of the etiopathogenesis of MCI and sporadic dementia and possibly reveal novel approaches for their effective treatment. MCI is characterized by a dysfunction in brain glucose metabolism as well as the accumulation of pathological proteins (e.g., tau, amyloid), biomarkers that correlate with disease severity. Tau misregulation is an important underlying mechanism of the progressive cognitive and neuropathological changes that develop in patients with MCI or dementia. Smoke inhaled through a cigarette (active or mainstream smoking) is an important risk factor for MCI and dementia. SHS doubles the risk for dementia among individuals who never smoked and it is 2-6 times more toxic and tumorigenic to humans than mainstream smoke. Thus, SHS might have a greater effect on brain metabolism and cognitive function than mainstream smoking. Studies strongly suggest that SHS increases the risk of MCI or dementia by perturbing brain metabolism (i.e., insulin signaling, oxidative stress) and the accumulation of pathological proteins (i.e, tau, amyloid). We hypothesize that chronic exposure to SHS induces changes in brain metabolism that lead to tau misregulation, amyloid accumulation and cognitive injury. We also hypothesize that these SHS-induced cognitive and pathological changes will be accelerated in susceptible individuals (i.e., those with misregulated tau such as htau mice). These hypotheses will be tested by comparing the effect of chronic (12-month) SHS exposure on cognitive function of wild-type and htau mice. Following behavioral and cognitive testing, brain areas pertinent to the behavioral and cognitive changes will be assessed for metabolic changes, tau and amyloid pathology, and neuronal loss. These studies will provide important information about the role of SHS in the cognitive injury and early metabolic changes in MCI. Importantly, this animal model may be especially useful for developing therapeutic agents to counteract the metabolic, pathological and cognitive changes following human exposure to SHS."
"9437219","At least 25% of Americans over the age of 65 have type 2 diabetes (T2D), which, in addition to its well- recognized complications, is accompanied by a high fracture risk, particularly in elderly patients. Importantly, these fractures are associated with worse outcomes than fractures in the general population. Standard explanations, namely low bone mass and high bone turnover, do not explain how T2D adversely impacts the aging skeleton. Rather, low bone turnover, specifically reduced formation of new bone, likely predisposes to a high fracture risk. This is compounded by altered material properties of bone that together diminish bone strength and increase its propensity to fracture. Both etiologies ? reduced bone formation and altered bone material properties ? are increasingly thought to arise from the accumulation of advanced glycation endproducts (AGEs). Hence, preventing the accumulation of AGEs in bone tissue in T2D patients is a potential therapeutic strategy with likely effects in reversing bone fragility in T2D. One novel intervention is pyridoxamine, a metabolite of vitamin B6 pyridoxal phosphate. Preclinical data show that pyridoxamine has specific molecular features which provide a unique multi-pronged effect to inhibit glycation reactions and the formation of AGEs. Pyridoxamine is also a potent inhibitor of AGE accumulation and improves bone material properties in diabetic animals. Notably, while it also reduces AGEs in patients with T2D with nephropathy, there are no clinical data on possible skeletal benefits in T2D. The objective of this application is to determine whether, in a short intervention study, pyridoxamine reverses bone fragility in patients with T2D, and to use this pilot data set as a foundation for larger and longer fracture studies. Our preliminary data show strong correlations between AGE accumulation and both bone formation and bone material properties. Namely, we have shown that skin autofluorescence (SAF), a marker for tissue AGE accumulation, correlates strongly with decreased bone formation. Likewise, using a novel impact microindentation device that provides an in vivo index of cortical bone material properties, namely bone material strength index (BMSi), we show that older T2D women have increased AGE accumulation and decreased BMSi. Furthermore, T2D women with the lowest pyridoxamine stores had the highest SAFs and lowest bone formation and BMSi. Together, these data underscore our central hypothesis: that pyridoxamine treatment in older T2D patients will increase bone formation and bone material strength by inhibiting AGE accumulation. If it is confirmed that pyridoxine does improve bone formation and/or bone material properties, this data set will form the framework for large scale testing to advance the development of pyridoxamine as a therapeutic agent that should reduce fractures in aging T2D patients. In this way, this project could have a positive impact on the large and ever growing population of elderly type 2 diabetic patients."
"9395865","PROJECT ABSTRACT It is well established that regular physical activity, including endurance (aerobic) exercise training and resistance exercise training has important effects on the prevention and treatment of numerous chronic diseases. Determining the molecular mechanisms or ?map? of the exercise response has become an important focus of biomedical research. The Molecular Transducers of Physical Exercise in Humans Consortium (MoTrPAC) will define the molecular footprint that underlies the enormously beneficial effects of exercise in humans. This application is for a Preclinical Animal Study Site (PASS). This Investigative team has the potential to play an important role in the design and execution of the MoTrPAC project based on our extensive experience and strong record of collaboration. The aims of Phase 1 are: 1) To provide outstanding intellectual contributions and advice, and work in a highly cooperative and collegial manner with the other members of the Steering Committee, to design the best possible experiments for the PASS studies. 2.) To use the wide variety of expertise in the laboratory to carry out highly controlled and accurate exercise studies and collection of animal tissue and blood samples. For this Phase, the rat has been identified as the animal model that most closely mimics humans and the most feasible to study. An emerging concept in exercise biology is that physical exercise activates tissue-to-tissue communication throughout the organism, and this tissue cross- talk can mediate some of the beneficial effects of exercise on health. The goal of Phase 2 is to carry out mechanistic studies to investigate newly and Consortium-identified circulating molecules involved in exercise- regulated tissue cross-talk, including identification of the function and source of the molecules. Skeletal muscle-derived myokines and adipose tissue-derived adipokines will be studied. The Specific Aims of Phase 2 of this project are: 1) To identify novel exercise-regulated adipokines and myokines based on data generated by MoTrPAC; 2) To determine the physiological targets and functions of candidate myokines and adipokines; 3) To determine if exercise-regulated myokines and adipokines can have beneficial effects on metabolic health in normal and metabolically compromised animals; and 4) To determine if putative exercise-induced myokines and adipokines are secreted from skeletal muscle and adipose tissue. These highly innovative studies will dramatically increase our understanding of the mechanisms by which physical activity improves human health and may provide the basis for future therapeutics to combat many chronic diseases."

"9390057","The objective of Project 3 is to define novel molecular pathways that controi adipocyte differentiation and  function. Elucidating signaling pathways that govern adipocyte differentiation and triglyceride storage in  adipose tissue pathways is expected to uncover new opportunities for therapeutic intervention in human  metabolic disease. During the current grant period, we discovered three previously uncharacterized proteins  that control lipid metabolism in adipocytes (TLE3, PSPC1, and IDOL). Building on our work in the current  grant period, we propose a series of molecular, cell biological, and mouse studies to investigate hypotheses  regarding the roles of these novel regulatory factors in physiology and disease. Specific Aim 1 is to elucidate  the mechanism of action of TLE3 in white versus brown adipose tissue phenotypic specification. We have  discovered that mice overexpressing TLE3 in adipose tissue show profound alterations in adipocyte function,  including a phenotypic shift from brown to white adipose tissue. Shifting white adipose tissue towards a  more brown character is associated with improved metabolism and resistance to diabetes. A better  understanding ofthe molecular pathways that control adipocyte phenotype would be highly significant and  may have therapeutic implications. Specific Aim 2 is to determine the function and mechanism of action of  the putative RNA-binding protein PSPC1 in adipocyte differentiation. PSPC1 was identified along with TLE3  in our initial high-throughput cDNA screen as a new promoter of adipocyte differentiation. Deciphering the  mechanism of action of this novel factor is likely to uncover new modes of action for regulatory factors in the  control of adipocyte gene expression. Specific Aim 3 is to define the role of the LXR-IDOL axis in  triglyceride metabolism and lipid storage. Preliminary analysis of Idol knockout mice points to an unexpected  function in the control of triglyceride metabolism and lipid storage. We hypothesize that LXR-dependent  regulation of IDOL in adipose tissue is an important determinant of peripheral lipoprotein receptor activity  and that IDOL provides a mechanism to link alterations in diet and sterol metabolism to lipid uptake and  metabolism in these tissues.  RELEVANCE (See instructions):  Altered adipose tissue function or mass is associated with cardiovascular metabolic disease, underscoring  the fundamental importance of adipocytes in metabolism. Elucidating signaling pathways that govern  adipocyte differentiation and triglyceride storage in adipose tissue pathways is expected to uncover new  opportunities for therapeutic intervention in human metabolic diseases (e.g., obesity, diabetes mellitus)."
"9445134","PROJECT SUMMARY  The overall goal of our program has been to improve the standard of care for brain tumor patients with a specific emphasis on glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). Towards this end, we initially developed oncolytic herpes simplex virus vectors (oHSV) to kill glioma cells, including the so-called glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs), and revealed the synergistic importance of viral oncolysis combined with immune stimulation (in situ oncolytic tumor vaccination). We demonstrated the advantage of blocking tumor-induced immune suppression and inducing anti-tumor immune responses during the process of in situ oncolytic tumor vaccination. Our studies of immune mechanisms demonstrated synergy of an oncolytic virus expressing a cytokine (IL12) with immune checkpoint inhibitors that forms an exciting avenue of research exploration for our next grant cycle, as well as for improved future clinical trials. Therefore, in this next grant cycle, we have designed studies to answer several important unmet needs in the immunovirotherapy of GBM: 1, How can a virus be better designed to stimulate an immune response to the tumor; 2, How can an oncolytic virus be used to overcome tumor-induced immunosuppression; and, 3, How can understanding tumor lymphocyte actions and macrophage reprogramming be utilized to improve therapeutic efficacy.  We are taking advantage of this iterative process of oHSV development to continually improve outcomes. In the novel studies we have proposed, we are exploring the combined use of uniquely designed oHSV to overcome the current limitations of immune therapy by combined local intra-tumoral expression of co- stimulatory ligands in concert with cytokine stimulation of an in-situ oncolytic tumor vaccine response. This approach should eliminate distant tumor cells, while minimizing toxicity and be amenable to additional combinations. Our studies explore several hypotheses leading to improvement in vector design and efficacy. These studies will then be used to make novel oncolytic viruses incorporating the advantageous features learned from each of the aims in this grant proposal. We expect that this will lead to an improved immunovirotherapy approach to take into clinical trial for GBM. This strategy is not only novel and unique but we emphasize that it could save costs by shortening the length of treatment and also would apply to other tumors both in the brain and in the periphery.  "
"9446530","PROJECT SUMMARY Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is characterized by lower limb arterial obstruction due to atherosclerosis. There are 8.5 million people with PAD in the U.S over the age of 40. Over the past 14 years, our multi-disciplinary team of investigators has developed several novel magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) endpoints for clinical trials for PAD patients with intermittent claudication (IC). Creatine chemical exchange saturation transfer (CrCEST) is a novel non-spectroscopic imaging method that allows measurement of creatine kinetics in a spatially localized manner at 3T that could increase the applicability of the measure and allow spatial matching to muscle perfusion. We hypothesize that CrCEST kinetics will distinguish PAD and normals in a highly reproducible manner and will correlate with PCr kinetics. Thus, Specific Aim 1 is to demonstrate that CrCEST kinetics distinguishes PAD patients from age-matched normal subjects and reproducibly measures calf muscle energetics with exercise. We will study 23 patients with PAD compared to 23 normal controls. We will also study reproducibility and examine correlation with PCr kinetics. Critical limb ischemia (CLI) presents as rest pain, ischemic ulceration, or gangrene due to the inability of resting blood flow to meet tissue metabolic demands. We plan to study CLI patients to both improve understanding of its pathophysiology and expand the reach of these novel methods beyond their application to IC. In recent years, endovascular revascularization has increased while surgery has declined and outcomes have improved. We hypothesize that catheter-based revascularization improves perfusion and energetics to a greater extent and sooner than surgical intervention. Therefore, Specific Aim 2 is to compare the effects of catheter-based and surgical revascularization on the time course of change in calf muscle perfusion and energetics in PAD. 120 patients (30 patients in each of 4 groups (IC with catheter-based or surgical revascularization, CLI with catheter-based or surgical revascularization) will be studied. Prognosis of CLI is significantly worse than IC with a combined mortality and amputation rate of 25-33% at 1 year. We hypothesize that lower calf muscle perfusion and worse energetics leads to worse outcome in CLI. Thus, Specific Aim 3 is to correlate muscle group specific perfusion and energetics with amputation- free survival in non-revascularized CLI. 65 patients with CLI that do not subsequently undergo revascularization will be studied and cuff/occlusion hyperemia measures of tissue perfusion with ASL before and 8-12 weeks after revascularization. Amputation-free survival will be tracked over 1-3 years."
"9391983","ABSTRACT  The primary goals of the Molecular Therapeutics (MT) Program are to study and evaluate cancer targets,  develop novel chemical probes that will lead to new therapies, and devise more effective delivery systems to  treat cancer. MT has highly integrated basic science and translational themes in five areas: chemical and  structural biology; drug discovery and development; drug delivery and nanotechnology; systems  pharmacology; and oncogenic signaling. MTs objective is to combine these elements to develop novel  therapeutics and to translate innovative discoveries into applications relevant to LCCC-initiated human trials.  Interactions of MT?s members with LCCC basic, translational and clinical faculty enables many of the scientific  steps needed for the discovery and development of promising therapies. This includes: (1) Discovery and  validation of new targets for cancer therapies, (2) Development of chemical probes to modulate and further  validate identified targets, (3) Development of faithful animal cancer models for the testing of novel  therapeutics, (4) Discovery and application of novel surface chemistry and nanoparticle synthesis for delivery  and formulation of promising therapeutics, (5) Characterization of PK/PD of novel therapeutics involving  preclinical models and patient clinical trials. The focused development of MT during the past five years  provides the requisite infrastructure and knowledge-base to truly do drug discovery in an academic setting. A  major strength of the program has been the enhancement of chemical biology that has benefited virtually  everyone involved in cancer research at UNC and in the Cancer Center. Examples of this success are  represented by LCCC investigator lead startups developing clinical-candidate MER inhibitors with potent anti-  tumor activity entering phase 1 trials, and the discovery of pharmacological quiescence where a lead  compound will begin Phase II testing in small cell lung cancer in early 2015. Leadership for Molecular  Therapeutics is provided by Stephen Frye, Director of the Center for Integrative Chemical Biology and Drug  Discovery (CICBDD) and Fred Eshelman Distinguished Professor in the UNC School of Pharmacy and Gary  Johnson, the Kenan Distinguished Professor and Chair of the Department of Pharmacology in the School of  Medicine. The program fosters a strong integrated research effort through the establishment, use and  advancement of core facilities and promoting highly interactive collaborations with Cancer Center investigators.  The Molecular Therapeutics Program consists of 42 members associated with the Schools of Medicine,  Pharmacy and Arts & Sciences. During the last funding period, program members have published 700 cancer-  related articles (30% collaborative). In 2014, our program members held 89 grants and $22M (total cost) in  annual extramural funding, including 36 grants and $8.8M (total costs) from the NCI."
"9438789","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Colorectal cancer (CRC) remains the third leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the United States. Despite important improvements in therapeutic strategies, the overall 5y survival remains around 65%. Thus, a large number of patients receive negligible benefit from current treatments. Consequently, there is a dire need to establish novel prognostic markers that can identify patients who will fail to benefit from the standard of care; 5- fluorouracil (5FU)-based chemotherapy. Here we seek to validate our exciting preliminary findings indicating that the ribosomal protein, Rpl22-Like1 (Like1), prognosticates poor survival in patients with stage III CRC. Alterations in ribosomal proteins have long been associated with increased cancer risk, but neither the mechanism by which they confer risk nor their utility as prognostic markers has been assessed. We have determined that Like1 promotes development and progression of T-acute lymphoblastic leukemia, when its expression is induced by loss of its paralog and antagonist, Rpl22. Rpl22 loss causes Like1 induction because Rpl22 normally acts to post-transcriptionally repress Like1 expression. Like1 induction upon Rpl22 loss not only facilitates cancer progression in leukemia, but also appears to do so in CRC. Indeed, in a small pilot study of 23 patients, we found that 20% of patients with stage III CRC express high levels of Like1 protein. Importantly, these patients exhibit low overall 5y survival (25%), compared to patients with low Like1 expression (95%). Preclinical studies conducted in parallel indicate that Rpl22-deficient (Like1-high) mice are highly resistant to weekly, myeloablative treatments with 5FU. We seek to test our hypothesis that patients with Like1-high CRC tumors exhibit reduced overall 5y survival, due to resistance to the 5FU-based chemotherapy used in treating CRC. Our rationale for positing 5FU-resistance as a possible mechanism of Like1 action is that Rpl22-deficient (Like1-high) mice are highly resistant to weekly, myeloablative treatments with 5FU. We will test our hypothesis in two Aims. In the first Aim, we will assess the level of Like1 expression in samples from a large cohort (338) of stage III CRC patient samples and then evaluate its relationship to overall survival (OS), disease free survival (DFS), and other variables such as stage (IIIa, IIIb, IIIc), histological grade, and microsatellite instability (MSI) status. In Aim 2, we will assess the molecular basis for Like1 induction and then identify the pathways (e.g., NFkB/Lin28b) that are dysregulated in association with Like1 induction, as these are likely to facilitate the aggressiveness of Like1-high CRC. Identification of these pathways is critical, as they may serve as novel therapeutic vulnerabilities in Like1-high patients, for whom standard 5FU-based chemotherapy regimens appear to be ineffective. Through these efforts, we expect to determine if Like1 induction is prognostic for reduced OS and DFS in stage III CRC and identify the pathways coregulated with Like1 that may be responsible for the chemoresistant behavior of Like1-high tumors. This is particularly critical for stage III CRC, where there is a dearth of prognostic biomarkers to guide clinical care."
"9395863","Project Summary S. aureus is a potent, opportunistic human pathogen that has evolved in a symbiotic relationship with its hosts and is notorious for its ability to cause life-threatening diseases such as sepsis, pneumonia and endocarditis. In 2005 S. aureus was responsible for more death in the US than any other microbial pathogen. S. aureus is unique in that the organism produces over a dozen fibrinogen (Fg) binding cell wall anchored proteins (MSCRAMMs) or small secreted proteins. Many of these proteins act as potent virulence factors and can recruit Fg and assemble a Fg containing coat surrounding and protecting the bacteria from phagocytosis and clearance. We believe that this Fg containing shield represents a key to understand the unique features of S. aureus virulence including the organism?s demonstrated resistance in several active and passive vaccination trials. Consequently, we propose to characterize the staphylococcal Fg binding proteins, their interactions with Fg and the conformational changes leading to the formation of the shield. We will use X-ray crystallography of complexes formed between the bacterial proteins/peptides and Fg fragments/peptides complemented by extensive biochemical studies to characterize the Fg interactions and determining interactive sites. Preliminary results show that the MSCRAMMs use a combination of a primary and a secondary synergistic site to bind Fg with high affinity whereas a common linear Fg binding motif present in two of the secreted proteins exhibits an amazingly high affinity for Fg. The conformational changes induced in Fg upon binding to different staphylococcal proteins will be identified by crystallographic analysis of intact Fg in complex with staphylococcal proteins/peptides and further analyzed in a mouse septicemia model. Based on the detailed information of staphylococcal protein/Fg interactions, we will identify MSCRAMM variants with altered affinity for Fg and explore the possibility that these exhibit altered virulence potentials. Finally, with comprehensive knowledge of staphylococcal Fg interactions, we will generate mAbs that can inhibit Fg binding to staphylococcal proteins. In the future, these mAbs could be developed to useful therapeutic agents."
"9390055","The objective of Project 1 (Function of GPIHBPI in Triglyceride Metabolism) in our Program Project Grant (PPG) is to define the function of GPIHBPI, a member of the Ly6 family of proteins, in plasma triglyceride metabolism and in the delivery of lipid nutrients to adipose tissue and muscle. This objective is closely aligned with the theme of our PPG?to understand new molecules and mechanisms underlying triglyceride delivery to parenchymal tissues, triglyceride synthesis, and adipogenesis.  Over the past 5 years, our PPG team showed that GPIHBPI transports lipoprotein lipase (LPL) from the interstitial spaces (where it is secreted by adipocytes and myocytes) to its site of action within the capillary lumen. This discovery solved a longstanding mystery in plasma lipid metabolism but simultaneously highlighted other lingering mysteries within the field. For example, no one has yet defined the mechanisms by which triglyceride-rich lipoproteins (TRLs) marginate within capillaries, so that lipolysis can proceed.  Other mysteries include the mechanism by which TRL-derived lipids move across endothelial cells and the precise structures governing LPL-GPIHBP1 interactions and interactions of TRLs with the LPL-GPIHBP1 complex. Also, it is unclear whether other members of the Ly6 protein family, aside from GPIHBP1, contribute to metabolism and obesity. Recently, Project 1 investigators have shown that knockouts of several Ly6 genes near Gpihbp1 are associated with protection from obesity and lower plasma lipid levels.  For the next 5 years. Project 1 investigators will pursue three Specific Aims. Specific Aim 1 is to define mechanisms for the margination of TRLs in capillaries. As part of this aim, we will investigate the functional relevance of a newly discovered endothelial cell organelle, nanovilli, in TRL margination and in the transport of LPL across endothelial cells. Specific Aim 2 is to better define interactions between GPIHBP1 and LPL  and to further elucidate the features of the LPL-GPIHBP1 complex required for interactions with TRLs.  Specific Aim 3 is to investigate how the inactivation of a cluster of Ly6 genes (Slurpl, Slurp2, Lypd2) near Gpihbp1 affects energy balance in mice and protects against adiposity."
"9433834","Project Summary Title: Personalized target selection for TMS therapy using functional vs. structural connectivity MRI Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is an FDA-approved treatment for major depressive disorder (MDD). Remission rates are estimated to be around 30%, similar to other antidepressant therapies yet still suboptimal. A key reason for the variability in response is the lack of an individualized approach that identifies the cortical therapeutic target for each patient. A proposed strategy is to use functional connectivity MRI to identify the topography of functional networks relevant to MDD. In this project, we propose a novel strategy to personalized identification of TMS targets by using diffusion MRI (dMRI) to identify the white matter bundles that connect two critical nodes affected by MDD: the left prefrontal cortex (PFC) and the subgenual cingulate (SGC). We will study 500 subjects from the Human Connectome Project (HCP) and 20 patients with MDD who were treated with TMS. We will use state-of-the-art functional connectivity and diffusion MRI data and analyses. Our goal is to quantify and compare, for the first time, the reliability of these methods to identify cortical targets for TMS therapy. In addition we will study the clinical efficacy of dMRI-guided TMS by retrospectively analyzing the relationship between therapeutic response and location of the stimulated TMS target in relation to the optimal dMRI node. Last, we will use sophisticated dMRI metrics to assess the changes in white matter microstructure induced by TMS and how they relate to clinical efficacy (therefore defining anatomical mechanisms of action and therapeutic targets). Results from this project will support future prospective trials aiming to confirm target engagement and therapeutic response using individualized dMRI-guided TMS in MDD and other neuropsychiatric conditions."
"9392187","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term goal of this grant is to establish a comprehensive understanding of post-transcriptional controls critical to mammalian erythroid differentiation. Erythroid differentiation is marked by a set of dramatic morphologic and functional changes, much of this process occurring in a transcriptionally-silent environment. For this reason erythroid differentiation is heavily dependent on post-transcriptional controls. RNA binding proteins (RBPs), the major regulators of post-transcriptional controls, impact on transcript processing in the nucleus as well as the stability and function of the mRNA in the cytoplasm. RBPs vary widely in their structures, binding specificities, and cellular compartmentalization and can modulate RNA functions by direct actions and/or via the recruitment of effector complexes. Identification of RBPs, their mRNA targets, and corresponding post-transcriptional controls have advanced our understanding of numerous developmental processes and have revealed unanticipated pathophysiologic pathways. By defining post-transcriptional controls in erythroid differentiation, we will expand our understanding of inherited and acquired disorders of erythropoiesis and establish a template for similar investigations in other systems. To achieve this goal, we will carry out a novel and state-of-the-art transcriptome-wide analyses to reveal the full range of mRNA-protein (mRNP) interactions that accompany the dynamic process of erythroid terminal differentiation. This approach combines biochemical methodologies with innovative informatic pipelines specifically designed for comprehensive descriptions of complex RNA-protein interactions. This unbiased analysis will be combined with a series of targeted in-depth mechanistic studies that focus on two sets of mRNA/protein interactions that we have identified to play central roles in erythroid differentiation. The combined output of these complementing approaches will establish the unique network of post-transcriptional controls in this developmentally robust and clinically relevant model system. This proposal encompasses three Specific Aims. Aim 1. Characterize the roles of the polyC-binding proteins, ?1 and ?2, as post- transcriptional integrators of erythroid differentiation. Aim 2. Identify the critical role(s) of the polyA binding protein, PABPC, in defining and sustaining the erythroid transcriptome. Aim 3. Map the global structure of mRNA/protein interactions in erythroid cells and define the dynamic nature of these interactions in the differentiation process. Combining transcriptome-wide analyses with targeted mechanistic studies will generate a powerful access to the complex array of RNA/protein interactions that constitute critical determinants of erythroid differentiation. Success in these studies will fundamentally alter our understanding of this intensively studied pathway; serve as a prototype for investigations of post- transcriptional controls in other systems, and present novel targets fo future diagnostic and therapeutic innovations."
"9444587","Project Summary/Abstract  The overall objective of the proposed research is to optimize and further the development of a vaccine directed against Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) using a novel platform, the Multiple Antigen Presentation System (MAPS) developed by the Malley laboratory at Boston Children?s Hospital (BCH). Most current bacterial vaccines are based on enhancing the immunogenicity of polysaccharide (PS) capsular antigens (which determine serotype in many bacteria) by chemical conjugation to proteins. These vaccines suffer from limitations including an inability to elicit CD4+ Th1 or Th17 responses to antigens and high complexity of manufacture. For several organisms, T cell responses (either alone or in conjunction with antibody responses) are deemed necessary for mucosal or systemic protection. To overcome these limitations, we have developed MAPS, a vaccine platform that confers comprehensive immunity by eliciting antibodies to the PS and proteins, and CD4+ Th1 and Th17 responses to proteins. The technology is based on our discovery that proteins and PS linked via the affinity interaction between biotin and rhizavidin behave like a conjugate protein-PS vaccine, with the added benefit of generating robust CD4+ Th1 and Th17 responses to proteins.  In preliminary studies, we have developed a TB MAPS vaccine composed of several Mtb proteins scaffolded onto a non-Mtb PS (pneumococcus type 1) which shows significant protection against pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) in a mouse model, particularly when combined with the live BCG vaccine; protection elicited by the combination of TB MAPS and BCG given concurrently at separate sites followed by 2 TB MAPS boosters is significantly greater compared to BCG or TB MAPS alone. Here, we will examine if protection by this TB MAPS construct can be augmented by the inclusion of one of three Mtb-specific PS. Our preliminary data strongly support the feasibility of this approach. To meet our goals, we have assembled a group of investigators that are experts in vaccine development (Dr. Malley from BCH and Dr. Pavliak from the International Vaccine Institute (IVI) in Korea, our industry partner) and tuberculosis research and animal models (Dr. Rubin from Harvard School of Public Health and Dr. Kaushal from Tulane University). The project will thus be a collaborative effort between investigators from academic institutions and a nonprofit agency with extensive experience in vaccine development (IVI). In the proposed experiments, we will evaluate whether the addition of Mtb PS to our current TB MAPS vaccine enhances protection in the mouse model, select the optimal TB MAPS vaccine (i.e. with or without Mtb PS, the proteins having been already selected) and then evaluate whether the combination of BCG given concurrently (at separate sites) with TB MAPS then followed by two booster doses of TB MAPS is superior to BCG alone in a nonhuman primate model of tuberculosis. A Product Development Plan has been prepared, which IVI will lead. These experiments, if successful, will pave the way for further development of this vaccine strategy for the prevention of TB."
"9448089","KSHV is the causative agent of all forms of Kaposi?s sarcoma (KS). KS is the most common form of cancer in males in sub-Saharan Africa and HIV-AIDS patients. KSHV is also responsible for several lymphoid disorders, including pleural effusion lymphoma (PEL) and Castleman?s disease. Long-term latent infection in B- lymphocytes and persistent infection in endothelial cells is thought to be a major driving force for KSHV oncogenesis. KSHV pathogenesis depends on viral persistence and highly regulated gene expression during latent infection. We have focused on epigenetic and chromatin organizing factors that regulate viral gene expression and maintain stable latency in KSHV infected tumor cells. Here, we expand our studies on the X- ray crystal structures of KSHV encoded LANA to explore its propensity to form higher-order oligomeric complexes that are necessary for episome maintenance. We investigate the relationship between LANA oligomerization and chromatin organization mediated by cellular factors, including the chromatin organizing factors CTCF and cohesins and the heterochromatin regulatory factors DAXX and EZH2. We also investigate how the bromodomain proteins BRD2 and BRD4 bind to the basic patch of the LANA DNA binding domain, and how these BET-proteins function to facilitate LANA chromatin binding, and epigenome architecture. We discovered that small molecule inhibitors of BET proteins, like JQ1, are potent activators of KSHV lytic gene expression, and investigate how disruption of BRD2 or BRD4 function alters the KSHV epigenome. Finally, we analyze transcriptomic data from KS lesions to reveal a central role of the Unfolded Protein Response (UPR) in regulating KSHV latency. We find that inducers of the UPR disrupt KSHV latency through a mechanism involving the rapid proteolytic cleavage of the Cohesin subunit RAD21. We propose that RAD21 cleavage functions as a rapid release trigger for lytic reactivation, and therefore represents a novel chromatin- conformation sensor mechanism for UPR stress. The potential mechanistic relationship between UPR and the RAD21-BRD2/4-LANA axis will be investigated. Finally, we explore how pharmacological inhibition of UPR may modulate KSHV gene expression to ameliorate KS progression and pathogenesis. These studies will advance our knowledge of KSHV infection opportunities for therapeutic intervention in KSHV-associated disease."
"9458066","Basic research can inform on mechanisms relevant to late onset neurodegenerative disease and suggest avenues of treatment. Healthy aging of the brain requires meticulous maintenance of protein synthesis/folding/degradation systems, and this capacity is often disrupted in neurodegenerative disease. Recently it has come to be appreciated that diseased neurons can produce toxic products like aggregated proteins that can be taken up by neighboring cells?there is speculation that this mechanism might be involved in disease spread within the brain. How neurons generate and send out extracellular material in vivo is a question that must be addressed as we consider therapeutic intervention. We study the aging nervous system in the simple animal model C. elegans, in which individual neurons, as well as labeled protein aggregates within them, can easily be visualized in the living organism. We have unexpectedly discovered that some C. elegans neurons can extrude large packets we call ?exophers?. The contents of these dramatically expelled exophers can contain introduced human disease protein aggregates. Multiple approaches to exaggerating protein-folding stresses in those neurons, including over-expressing human Alzheimer?s disease fragment Ab1-42 or Huntington?s disease-associated polyQ protein, and genetically or pharmacologically impairing branches of protein homeostasis, increase exopher formation. Aggregated proteins extruded in exophers travel through a neighboring cell, which we think attempts to degrade the expelled neurotoxic aggregates, but the non-degradable trash can pass through to be taken up by distant cells. We hypothesize that exopher production is a previously unrecognized alternative route for adult neurons to clear protein aggregates. We speculate that this mechanism, and the associated mechanism of release and uptake by surrounding cells, is conserved across species and may be analogous to currently unknown mechanisms operating in human brain relevant to neurodegenerative disease. We propose to exploit the considerable advantages of the C. elegans model system (transparent body, easy genetic manipulation, exquisitely defined nervous system, powerful cell biology, short lifespan) to advance understanding of exopher biology. Our goals are to: 1) define the genetic and cell biological events that are critical for exopher formation by probing motors, cytoskeletal factors and membrane trafficking agents that we know are important; 2) learn about the exodus of the extruded exopher as it transits though neighboring tissues, defining how the invading exopher is recognized, reacted to, and, if resistant, thrown out again. Our work should inform on a novel pathway of proteostasis control relevant to both healthy brain aging and neurodegenerative disease, defining a new area for study and for development of clinical interventions."
"9445087","Project Summary: Title: Synthesizing Image-derived Heterogeneity with Genomic Measurements for Assessing Disease Aggressiveness in Lower Grade Gliomas WHO Grade II low grade gliomas (LGGs) are a type of brain tumor with an average incidence of 1/100,000 person-years within the population. Approximately 4000 people are diagnosed with this disease each year. It has been observed that even after the first line of therapy (surgery, chemo-radiation), this disease inevitably recurs. Further, it eventually transforms to a higher grade (WHO Grade III/IV) over time, a process referred to as malignant transformation (MT). Even though MT is almost inevitable, the time-to-MT can be quite variable. In aggressive cases, the LGG can undergo MT quite early in disease course, while in other (less aggressive) cases, the duration to MT is much longer. This variability in time-to-MT can spell very disparate prognoses for the patient. Such uncertainty in the disease evolution of LGGs also creates significant challenges for treatment man- agement. Apart from creating uncertainty for the oncologist as how to appropriately manage the disease, this also creates an anxiety-ridden scenario for the patients and their caregivers who try to understand their individual condition. A rational strategy to understand and characterize the aggressiveness of LGGs can provide valuable insight into the appropriate approach of treatment and surveillance for these patients. In this proposal, we will address three specific aims that build a comprehensive, integrative statistical model, which incorporates novel, complex imaging predictors, in addition to standard clinical and genomic characteris- tics, for informing time-to-malignant transformation of LGGs. This tool can provide an assessment of anticipated disease course that will help the patient and physician make suitable treatment decisions as well as to design appropriate monitoring methods to track the progression and status of the tumor. Such a tool can also help ameliorate some of the uncertainty and anxiety for the patients and their caregivers who will be better equipped to understand their individual disease, in addition to enabling a more effective collaboration between patient and physician to determine the most appropriate treatment approach. In particular, we will develop novel tumor het- erogeneity objects, which efficiently capture inter- and intra-tumor variation in morphology and intensity-distribu- tion characteristics. These objects are functional in nature and lie on nonlinear spaces. This introduces a signif- icant challenge in statistical analysis such as defining association measures between the tumor heterogeneity objects and genomic covariates, or incorporating these objects as predictors in an integrative statistical model. To address these goals, we will use data on WHO Grade II LGG patients treated at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center to identify imaging, genomic and clinical characteristics of malignant transformation. This dataset is unique because, aside from imaging (radiographic) and genomic information, there is carefully curated clinical data about the disease course of every patient (such as overall survival and time-to-malignant transformation)."
"9402650","PROJECT SUMMARY Asthma is a common lung disorder whose activity is strongly influenced by time. Asthma symptoms vary with the season (reflecting rates of respiratory viral infection), and they also vary by the time of day, such that many patients experience their worst symptoms in the middle of the night. The latter suggests that the circadian clock, a collection of genes that produce circadian rhythms, is connected to asthma. While viruses and circadian rhythms are both known to affect asthma symptoms, these two aspects of disease have never been mechanistically linked. Here, we discovered that a circadian clock gene called bmal1 may impact asthma by regulating the lung?s response to common respiratory viruses. We show that disruption of the clock gene bmal1 in mice produces an aberrant antiviral response to parainfluenza and influenza A viruses, resulting in severe lower respiratory tract infection. The antiviral actions of bmal1 appear localized to airway epithelial cells, where this gene orchestrates interferon responses during acute viral illness. After the acute infection resolves, we show in mice that bmal1 deficiency exacerbates post-viral chronic airway disease, including features that are characteristic of asthmatic lungs. Finally, we found that bmal1 expression is down-regulated in airway samples from asthma patients. Based on these data, we hypothesize that the circadian clock regulates the antiviral responses of airway epithelial cells through bmal1, and thereby controls the severity of acute and chronic viral lung pathology. We further hypothesize that circadian clock function is defective in the airway epithelial cells of asthmatics, leading to reduced bmal1 expression, and potentially explaining the heightened susceptibility that these patients have to respiratory viruses. To determine the mechanism by which bmal1 mediates antiviral defenses in the respiratory system we propose the following Specific Aims: 1) Determine how bmal1 in airway epithelial cells controls interferon gene expression and the severity of acute respiratory viral illness in mice; 2) Determine how bmal1 deficiency promotes post-viral chronic airway disease in mice; and, 3) Determine the nature of the circadian clock dysfunction in the airway epithelium of asthmatic patients. We will address Aim1 by using airway-conditional bmal1 knockout mice and in vitro culture of bmal1- null mouse tracheal epithelial cells to delineate how this gene regulates the interferon response to respiratory viruses (Sendai and Influenza A viruses). We will address Aim 2 by using tamoxifen-inducible bmal1 knockout mice to define when in the course of infection bmal1 is needed for the regulation of post-viral lung disease. We will address Aim 3 by using a luciferase reporter system to analyze circadian clock function and bmal1 expression in cultured human airway cells, derived from normal and asthmatic subjects."
"9319618","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Common treatments for osteoporosis include bisphosphonates, which inhibit osteoclast activity. Newer treatments such as PTH focus on enhancing osteoblast activity. However, due to the crosstalk between osteoblasts and osteoclasts an increase of osteoblast activity may lead to increased osteoclast activity and therefore increased bone turnover. In the clinic this is circumvented by administering bisphosphonates in addition to PTH. A single therapeutic that enhances osteogenesis and decreases osteoclastogenesis and/or osteoclast activity is currently unavailable, but is desperately needed. We propose to determine the mechanism of a new peptide CK2.3 that enhances osteogenesis and decreases osteoclastogenesis and osteoclast activity in vitro and in vivo. Addition of CK2.3 to cells leads to the activation of BMP2 signaling pathways and mineralization. Injection of CK2.3 into calvaria, as well as in the tail vain of mice, increases boe mineral density (BMD). In sharp contrast to BMP2, stimulation of cells with CK2.3 or CK2.3 injection into the tail vain of mice inhibits osteoclast activity in vivo and in vitro. The therapetic CK2.3 stimulates distinct pathways of a powerful growth factor BMP2. CK2.3 is designed to block the interaction between the BMP type Ia receptor (BMPRIA) and Casein Kinase 2 (CK2) leading to activation of specific BMP2 signaling pathways. However, the exact mechanism of the peptide must be explored. A major drawback of the use of BMPs as osteoporosis treatment is the long term affect that causes increased bone turnover. Additionally, BMP2 is known to stimulate osteoclastogenesis. The response of patients to BMP2 shows several side effects and BMP2 is not very effective as a treatment. Based on our published and preliminary data CK2.3 maybe a unique therapeutic that can be used for the treatment of osteoporosis. The goal of this proposal is to determine the mechanism of CK2.3. Even if CK2.3 may not be suitable as a therapeutic for osteoporosis it opens new ways to decipher new pathways and targets for osteoporosis treatment. New therapeutics are desperately needed."
"9421286","Abstract Our objective is to investigate a new, minimally-invasive regenerative nanotherapy to arrest or regress growth of small (<5.5 cm diameter) abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs). AAAs are localized expansions of the abdominal aorta that ultimately rupture. Early surgery on small AAAs provides no treatment benefit and no other proven therapies exist. While reinstating homeostasis of the structural extracellular matrix (ECM; collagen and elastic fibers) in the AAA wall is critical to stop or reverse AAA growth, this is impeded by a) their chronic breakdown in the aorta wall by upregulated matrix metalloprotease (MMPs) enzymes and b) lack of approaches to overcome intrinsically deficient and defective elastic fiber regenerative repair by adult vascular smooth muscle cells (SMCs). Oral dosing of doxycycline (DOX) has been shown to inhibit MMPs in the AAA wall to slow AAA growth, but has systemic side effects and inhibits elastin biosynthesis at the high doses. To avoid this, we have formulated biodegradable polylactic-co- glycolic acid (PLGA) nanoparticles (NPs) for steady, sustained release of doxycycline (DOX), an MMP inhibitor within the AAA wall following one-time, catheter-wise infusion to a transiently flow-occluded AAA segment. At the much lower release levels (<10 ?g/ml), DOX was found to maintain its MMP inhibitory effects, but also to beneficially stimulate elastic matrix neoassembly (elastogenesis). We also uniquely surface-functionalized our NPs with cationic amphiphiles that have pro-elastogenic & anti-proteolytic separate from the effects of the released DOX. Building on this promising preliminary data, we now propose to confirm the signaling mechanisms underlying the unique pro- matrix regenerative and anti-MMP effects of DOX at sub-oral doses, identify DOX-NP formulations that provide a significant stimulus to biomimetic and stable elastic fiber assembly, design and test a magnetic guidance system for efficient NP delivery to the AAA wall, and demonstrate efficacy of the DOX-NPs in regressing already formed small AAAs in a preclinical (rat) model. Our aims will test hypotheses that 1) pro-elastogenic effects of DOX are mediated by JNK decreases which trigger increases in TGF-?1, 2) quantity and quality of elastic fiber assembly can be regulated by modulating severity of JNK inhibition by DOX, 3) DOX is more effective than SP600125 (at their IC50 doses for JNK) in stimulating elastin since it also directly inactivates MMPs, and 4) regenerative stimuli due to DOX-NPs will restore matrix homeostasis in the AAA wall to arrest its growth. Aim 1 will correlate severity of DOX inhibition of JNK to downstream elastogenesis and anti-MMP outcomes in rat AAA SMC cultures. Aim 2 will generate DOX-NP formulations with superior pro-elastogenic & matrix reparative properties. Aim 3 will develop a magnetic system to target DOX-NPs to the AAA wall in a rat model. Aim 4 will assess therapeutic efficacy of magnetically-responsive DOX-NPs in rat AAAs. If successful, our approach will be validated in larger animal models to rationalize future clinical trials. Our approach can prospectively reduce or delay need for future surgery in high risk elderly AAA patients."
"9389524","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have recently identified a region of chromosome 9p21 as the most important source of heritable cardiovascular risk. This locus is independent of traditional risk factors such as smoking, hypertension and hyperlipidemia, suggesting it potentiates disease via a novel mechanism. The most predictive 9p21 variants account for more than 20% of an individual's lifetime risk for coronary artery disease. Despite being implicated in the leading cause of death in the Western world, the mechanism(s) by which these polymorphisms lead to vascular disease remain unclear.  In this proposal, the investigators seek to elucidate the relationship between a leading candidate gene at the 9p21 risk locus, CDKN2B, and vascular disease. Specifically, they will query the role of this gene in angiogenesis, and the concept that CDKN2B may regulate disease via a paradoxical and antagonistic effect on blood vessel sprouting, and blood vessel maturation. This proposal will bring together recognized experts from several fields, deeply phenotyped human tissue samples and unique mouse models with the objective of fully describing the vascular biology of CDKN2B. This application includes three specific aims which will: 1) Map the molecular mechanism by which CDKN2B regulates blood vessel stabilization; 2) Employ novel cell-specific Cdkn2b knockout animals to specifically determine which cell type regulates the pathologic response to ischemia, and whether the process is reversible; and 3) Determine whether the angiogenic defect also promotes atherosclerotic plaque vulnerability and myocardial infarction in human carriers of the 9p21 risk allele. The objective of these studies is to 'reverse translate' the biology of the 9p21 locus and contribute to the field of cardiovascular genetics in the post-GWAS era.

In this paradigm, the association between an initially neutral sensory stimulus with an aversive event (footshock) leads to the transformation of the neutral stimulus into a conditioned stimulus (CS) that elicits fear responses in the form of immobility, potentiated startle, changes in heart rate, etc, which were not evoked by the neutral sensory stimulus. Ample evidence indicates that the CS must be transmitted through the modality-specific sensory thalamus to reach emotional processing centers in the amygdala, where the association with the aversive stimulus occurs and an output drives the conditioned responses. In contrast, little is known about the neural circuits involved in active avoidance behavior. In this paradigm, subjects learn to avoid an aversive event by producing an appropriate behavioral response (avoidance) during an interval signaled by the presentation of a CS. Understanding active avoidance behavior is important because it is present in most forms of pathological anxiety. Using optogenetics and chemogenetics, we recently found that the output of the basal ganglia through GABAergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr) fully controls active avoidance. SNr excitation blocks active avoidance without interfering with the ability to escape the harmful event, while SNr inhibition facilitates avoidance or can drive it in the absence of an external CS. With this work as a backdrop, we have developed a hypothetical model of the neural circuits involved in the performance (expression) of active avoidance behavior. Here we propose to test key aspects of this model. Our hypothesis is that SNr mediates active avoidance behavior though its projections to specific portions of the midbrain that drive the locomotor responses needed to avoid. Moreover, specific regions of the striatum control SNr activity during avoidance via striatonigral connections. We will employ a combination of behavioral, electrophysiological, optogenetics, chemogenetics, pharmacological and histological procedures to test these ideas. The long term objective of this research project is to reveal the neural substrates of active avoidance behavior, which has direct relevance to many psychiatric disorders."
"9446315","Project Summary Emerging evidence suggests that inappropriate matrix metalloprotease (MMP) activity may underlie the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis and vascular inflammation. Despite data that MMPs contribute to atherosclerotic lesion remodeling and poor outcomes, essentially nothing is known regarding the role of MMPs as active signaling molecules in controlling the behavior of vascular cells in the context of atherosclerotic disease. We recently made the unanticipated discovery that MMP-1 cleaves and activates protease-activated receptor-1 (PAR1) signaling in blood vessels. This is of major import as it was the first report of a direct signaling function of the principal collagenase in blood vessels. Notably, we found that MMP-1 activates PAR1 by cleaving the receptor at a distinct site from the canonical thrombin cleavage site which generates a longer tethered ligand that is biased towards a different spectrum of G protein signaling pathways. The studies in this proposal will focus on the completely unexplored role of MMP1-PAR1 in the development of atherosclerotic plaques. Furthermore, the involvement of PAR1 in atherosclerosis (regardless of the protease agonist) as a chronic evolving inflammatory disease, is essentially unknown. The central hypothesis to be tested in aim 1 is that endothelial MMP-1 first acts as an active signaling molecule via PAR1 to trigger endothelial inflammation and monocyte entry into early plaques. In advanced lesions, MMP1 from macrophages autostimulates PAR1 to perpetuate a chronic inflammatory and mitogenic state by secretion of MCP-1 and other mediators. We will use both cell-based experiments, and hyperlipidemic mouse models with genetic deficiency of Mmp1a or Par1. We will determine the requirement of MMP1a and PAR1 in mouse endothelial cells for monocyte adhesion and transmigration under shear flow conditions in vitro using mouse heart endothelial cells isolated from of Mmp1a-/- and Par1-/- mice, and monocytes from ApoE-/- mice after high fat diet. Aim 2 will examine the role of the MMP1-PAR1 system on circulating monocytes in subjects with coronary artery disease and acute coronary syndromes undergoing percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI). Monocytes from patients at baseline prior to PCI and from those being treated with a novel PAR1 pepducin, PZ-128, will be used in Parallel Plate (arterial-shear) flow chambers to determine transmigration through endothelial monolayers. We will determine whether subjects with a super-active Mmp1 promoter polymorphism exhibit higher expression of MMP1 that contributes to a `MMP1-PAR1' phenotype vs `TF-PAR1' phenotype on their monocytes. Aim 3 will use adoptive transfer of bone marrow-derived cells from Par1-/-ApoE-/- and Mmp1a-/-ApoE-/- mice to help define the cell- type specific pathobiology (e.g. endothelium vs leukocytes) of the MMP1-PAR1 system in atherogenesis. Our understanding of the pathophysiologic relevance of MMP1-PAR1 signaling on endothelium and monocytes/ macrophages, and the mechanism linking these events to atherosclerotic plaque development will provide a framework to advance future therapies that could halt or reverse the progression of atherosclerosis."
"9453564","Summary/Abstract  Recent work, including that from our group, has highlighted a role for microglia, innate immune cells of the CNS, in mediating diet-induced dysfunction in the hypothalamus, a brain region controlling energy intake and expenditure. The objective of this proposal is to identify specific microglial populations responsive to diet- associated signals, and determine how they transduce this response to influence hypothalamic control over metabolic function. The goal is to use this information to target microglia in order to produce new, powerful, and specific ways to limit diet-induced obesity and its metabolic consequences. To reach our objective, we have developed innovative mouse models to identify subsets of microglia in confined areas such as the mediobasal hypothalamus, and to specifically measure the genome-wide transcriptional impact of dietary excess on hypothalamic microglia, infiltrating macrophages, and neurons critical to metabolic control. We will combine these tools with others allowing us to manipulate the number and polarization of microglia, in order to determine how microglia modulate the function of neuronal circuits controlling energy balance. The following aims are proposed: (1) Identify the diversity of hypothalamic microglia that are responsive to signals linked to dietary excess; (2) Determine the molecular mechanisms by which A20, a key regulator of inflammatory function, restricts the diet-induced inflammatory activation of hypothalamic microglia; and (3) Determine the mechanisms by which hypothalamic microglia modulate neuronal gene expression. Completing the proposed work holds promise to reveal new and unexpected strategies to mitigate obesity and its consequences.  The Candidate, Dr. Martin Valdearcos, is training in the lab of Dr. Suneil Koliwad at the University of California San Francisco (UCSF). Dr. Valdearcos' work on microglia has led him to create a research niche focused on immunologic determinants of hypothalamic function that is distinct from that of Dr. Koliwad. The career development goal of this proposal, therefore, is to optimally foster Dr. Valdearcos' emerging research program and forge a path towards academic independence. To achieve this, he will in addition to receiving career-focused mentorship from Dr. Koliwad, also receive intensive mentorship from Dr. Allison Xu, a leader in hypothalamic physiology and Dr. Katerina Akassoglou, an expert in neuroinflammation and microglial function. Dr. Valdearcos' career development plan also involves formal courses in immunology, hypothalamic physiology and genomic technologies. Finally, he has a strategically designed advisory committee that includes Drs. Ajay Chawla, Averil Ma, Zachary Knight and Mark Ansel, who each bring a wealth of content- specific expertise designed to guide Dr. Valdearcos' in gaining exactly the expertise he will need going forward."
"9393294","Using the formation of a virus particle (virion) from SV40 minichromosomes as a model for the generation of repressive chromatin by nucleosome remodeling, we will characterize how the combination of nucleosome location and associated histone modifications controls gene expression. Our central hypothesis is that the nucleosome location and the histone modifications associated with the nucleosome directly contribute to reorganization. The specific aims are (1) To characterize the changes in nucleosome positioning and corresponding histone modifications during the encapsidation of minichromosomes late in infection and (2) To determine which transcriptional regulatory sequences direct nucleosome positioning and histone modifications during encapsidation. For comparison purposes bulk nucleosome locations will be determined from micrococal nuclease digestion of chromatin from minichromosomes and disrupted virions. The location of nucleosomes containing specific histone modifications along with all of the other nucleosome positions in each sample of chromatin will be obtained using our modified ChIP-Seq procedure, which we developed. Intact SV40 chromatin will be immune selected with antibody to a particular histone modification bound to agarose, the ChIP chromatin purified on the agarose, and fragmented by micrococcal nuclease digestion. The DNA present in the agarose-bound chromatin fragments and the free fragments will be separately purified, libraries prepared, and paired-end sequenced using an Illumina MiSeq. The location of nucleosomes will then be determined from a bioinformatics analysis of the sequencing reads in the parallel libraries. SV40 chromatin will be obtained from wild-type and mutant minichromosomes and encapsidation intermediates and recombinant constructs containing specific regulatory elements within a defined chromatin reporter region. The changes in nucleosome location and histone modifications will then be correlated with the process of encapsidation and the presence of specific DNA elements. The proposed studies are innovative because for the first time we will be characterizing both nucleosome location and histone modifications in the same nucleosomes while remodeling to repress transcription is occurring as part of virion formation. The work is also significant since linking histone modifications to nucleosome location would advance our understanding of how nucleosome location is regulated. Because SV40 is also a model for closely related human pathogens understanding epigenetic repression by nucleosome positioning may lead to novel therapeutic approaches to address the disease caused by the pathogens."
"9473711","Leptospirosis is the most widespread neglected zoonotic disease in the world. It affects vulnerable populations such as rural subsistence farmers and urban slum dwellers. Urban epidemics are reported in cities in developing countries and will likely increase as the world?s slum population doubles to 2 billion by 2030. An unexpected outbreak was reported in New York City recently and climate change may account for its re-emerging status. A recent review of published cases estimated that leptospirosis causes ~1 million cases a year resulting in ~5-10% death rate. The gold standard for serodiagnosis of Leptospirosis is the MAT assay, which is 100 years old. MAT cannot be used for rapid case identification since it requires analysis of paired serum (acute and convalescent) in a reference laboratory with highly trained personnel and expensive equipment. Thus, MAT is rarely performed routinely even by diagnostic laboratories. Currently, there are no rapid quantitative assays on the market for serodiagnosis of Leptospirosis. In this Phase I SBIR, we propose two specific aims to develop a new diagnostic testing device for detection of antibodies against multiple L. interrogans antigens at the Point-of-Care. This low-cost portable device is a quantitative rapid assay that can perform POC testing as accurately as a laboratory ELISA. The test will be inexpensive (about 10 cents in material) and can be performed in 20 minutes, allowing for early diagnosis of Leptospirosis and treatment in the first visit to the doctor?s office. The technology can be adapted to a smartphone-based reader in a subsequent Phase II application to allow for serodiagnosis in remote field locations."
"9378733","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):          Alzheimer's disease (AD) affects more than 5 million Americans, and this number is expected to nearly triple to more than 13 million by 2050 due to the growing population of older adults in our society. In Veterans, the overall prevalence of dementia among those treated at VA medical centers has been estimated at 7.3%. AD is the most common cause of dementia in Veterans aged 65 and older. Veterans may be at increased risk for AD relative to the general population due to the demographics of the Veteran population (e.g., older age) and the high prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors (e.g., hypertension, diabetes) which can increase risk for cognitive decline and dementia. As the number of Veterans diagnosed with AD increases dramatically in the coming years and decades, the costs associated with dementia care will also rise at alarming rates. The process of AD is believed to begin many years prior to the clinical diagnosis, and there is a need for enhanced detection and characterization of early phases of AD (i.e., mild cognitive impairment [MCI]). Previous studies have shown that AD and MCI are heterogeneous disorders that involve multiple underlying neuropathologies, including coexisting AD and cerebrovascular disease pathologies. Although there has been an increased focus on identifying sophisticated biomarkers indicative of early AD, methods of characterizing cognition in prodromal AD have remained relatively coarse. It has recently been established that the conventional method of diagnosing MCI is highly susceptible to diagnostic errors, while a novel actuarial neuropsychological method for MCI diagnosis significantly improves diagnostic accuracy. The goal of this Career Development Award (CDA-2) is for the candidate to develop the necessary skills to become an independent clinical scientist investigating cognitive and biomarker profiles associated with prodromal AD in Veterans. The application contains a research project aimed at identifying accurate and inaccurate MCI diagnoses in 84 older adult Veterans and characterizing participants in terms of their unique vascular and AD biomarker profiles. [The project will also examine preclinical AD, an asymptomatic phase of AD in which individuals are classified as cognitively normal yet test positive for biomarkers/cognitive markers  associated with AD.] All participants will undergo a multimodal assessment at baseline and repeat neuropsychological evaluation at one-year intervals. Vascular biomarkers will include cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) markers of blood-brain barrier breakdown (i.e., cyclophilin A, matrix metalloproteinase 9, and a CSF/plasma albumin quotient ratio), and neuroimaging evidence of vascular pathology (i.e., white matter hyperintensities, cerebral microbleeds, reduced cerebral blood flow). AD biomarkers will include CSF concentrations of beta-amyloid, tau, and hyperphosphorylated tau, and neuroimaging markers of cortical thinning. This study is highly innovative in that it is the first to examine vascular and AD biomarkers of both accurate and inaccurate diagnosis using novel definitional criteria for MCI in a Veteran population. [The use of  actuarial criteria to define subtle cognitive decline using individual test scores in preclinica AD is also novel.] This CDA-2 application includes a comprehensive training program which builds upon the applicant's background and existing skills in neuropsychological assessment/diagnosis, cognitive aging, and cognitive profiles of MCI. The training plan is focused on building additional competencies in CSF and neuroimaging biomarkers associated with vascular and AD risks, longitudinal data analysis, and developing expertise in the integration of neuropsychology and biomarkers. The multidisciplinary mentoring team includes expertise in all aspects of the proposal including cognitive profiling of MCI, CSF biomarkers, neuroimaging biomarkers, and longitudinal statistics. The proposed project and the exceptional training opportunities available at the VA San Diego Healthcare System and the University of California San Diego will assist the applicant in accomplishing her long-term career objective of transitioning into an independent VA clinical scientist conducting patient-oriented research in the  field of neuropsychology and dementia risk."

"9429329","SUMMARY Due to the intensifying threat of the Zika virus to human health, the development of point-of-care methods to screen for the Zika virus represent an area of urgent need. Current approaches for the clinical testing of the Zika virus rely on conventional biochemical, genetic, and immunological laboratory assays that require complex instrumentation and expensive reagents (e.g., antibodies and fluorescent labels). While these methods are effective, the requirements of these methods, which also often involve multiple steps, making detection cumbersome, are prohibitive for point-of-care testing. The overall aim of this proposal is to develop a label-free screening platform for the detection of Zika by integrating stimuli-responsive and optically diffracting materials. Specifically, in this approach, we will investigate an optical biosensing platform comprised of a hydrogel material that swells in the presence a protease that is specific to Zika and is impregnated with a crystalline colloidal array (CCA). To develop such materials, polystyrene particles that self-assemble into a CCA will be co-polymerized into a polyacrylamide film that contains peptide crosslinks that may be cleaved by the protease (NS2B-NS3). Cleavage of the crosslinks by the protease is expected to physically alter the crosslinking density of the hydrogel network, thereby eliciting an increase in the volume of the hydrogel. As a result of swelling, the lattice spacing of the CCA will be altered, thereby triggering a change in optical diffraction of the hydrogel that can be detected at visible wavelengths without exogenous labels. The central hypothesis of this work is that the change in lattice spacing of the CCA-containing hydrogel, and thus the shift in wavelength of peak diffraction, will correlate with the proteolytic activity of NS2B-NS3. To directly test this hypothesis, the specific aims of this proposal are to: 1) characterize the optical response of CCA-containing hydrogels with peptide crosslinks in the presence of NS2B- NS3 (Aim 1) and 2) investigate the selectivity of the CCA-based sensing platform to NS2B-NS3 from the Zika virus (Aim 2). The sensitivity, including detection range and response time, of the films will be determined by treating the films, which will be prepared in multi-well plates that allow for high-throughput parallel detection, with different amounts of NS2B-NS3 and for different times. Additionally, a theoretical model of the swelling and optical responses will be developed, which will permit rational modification of the hydrogel properties to improve the overall sensitivity to NS2B-NS3. In aim 2, the selectivity of the screening platform towards the Zika homologue of NS2B-NS3 will be characterized by quantitatively comparing the optical response elicited by NS2B-NS3 from Zika with that from genetically related viruses. Furthermore, we will explore avenues to increase the selectivity of the sensing approach for Zika NS2B-NS3 by altering the peptide crosslinking sequence. In addition to point-of-care testing, the advantages of this label-free platform present new opportunities for screening for novel inhibitors of NS2B-NS3, which have immense therapeutic potential."

"9448077","PROJECT SUMMARY The Strong Heart Study (SHS) is a multi-center, longitudinal resource designed to better understand cardiovascular disease in American Indians, identify significant risk factors, promote new research and deliver better health care. To achieve these goals, SHS data should be accessible to interested and qualified researchers, while no harm is done to the study participants who contribute their data. Thus private information in the data and the identity of the participants should be protected, and SHS tribal sovereignty and agreements that include tribal review and approval of all SHS data use requests should be respected. Our study aims to address these issues using advanced technologies and scientific computing toolkits to enable shared, but protected, data access, as well as to understand the data sharing preferences of SHS participants. The first aim is to develop an innovative, secure data-centric service to protect computation on SHS data according to governance practices that are acceptable to participating SHS tribes, SHS investigators, and the NIH. Specifically, we will build a system for secure analysis on protected data through a virtual private network, in which only approved operations and outputs are permitted. The proposed framework will allow researchers to easily and securely perform specific statistical analysis on SHS data and meta-analyses. The second aim is to develop novel federated computing models to support the SHS Coordinating Center and Genetics Center to analyze data in a distributed manner. The methods for achieving the second aim rely on new, practical federated data analysis technology. For example, in the case of vertically partitioned data, different data from the same SHS participants may be stored at different sites, such as genomic data and phenotype data that are currently stored at the SHS Genetics Center and the SHS Coordinating Center, respectively. The third aim is to understand the data sharing expectations and preferences of SHS participants to inform the implementation of the data sharing models. This aim will be carried out through qualitative and quantitative methods, which include the use of individual interviews and surveys of SHS participants."

"9359996","Project Summary/Abstract Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a silent epidemic, which recently has been labeled the signature injury of current combat operations, a population often exposed to stressful stimuli and emotional trauma. While TBI is typically known to impair learning and memory for neutral events, traumatic fear memories are enhanced after TBI, consistent with increased prevalence of comorbid TBI and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Mechanisms that underlie the complex TBI-PTSD comorbidity and associated emotional consequences are poorly understood. Although categorized separately from the emotional consequences of TBI, common physical symptoms including phonophobia, hyperacusis, and sensory sensitivity in other modalities may interact and influence emotional and stress responses. Given the highly conserved and redundant connectivity between auditory and limbic networks, and their vulnerability to TBI, alterations in sensory processing after diffuse TBI may result in otherwise neutral stimuli adopting aversive properties and impacting the encoding of traumatic memories. Our findings demonstrate that diffuse TBI causes dynamic changes in plasticity within amygdala neurocircuitry known to underlie stress, emotion, and fear learning processes and that TBI-induced changes within auditory fear circuitry correspond to robustly enhanced contextual fear when footshocks are paired with white noise auditory stimuli, but not low frequency pure tones. This proposal will test the hypothesis that auditory sensitivity following diffuse TBI underlies enhanced fear learning to white noise. We will first determine whether diffuse TBI heightens sensitivity in emotional-auditory networks in a series of convergent and novel anatomical, immunohistochemical, and behavioral approaches. Second, using novel viral mediated technology that allows direct manipulation of activity in specific target projections, we will causally determine the involvement of auditory-amygdala network function during white noise fear conditioning on the observed enhanced fear phenotype after TBI. Findings from these studies could uncover a novel interaction between common TBI sequelae that has not been considered previously. Translational research on the underlying contributing mechanisms of posttraumatic stress after TBI is a critical line of work in need of immediate investigation to determine targets for treatments and preventions for human patients in both military and civilian contexts."
"9421285","PROJECT SUMMARY: Our laboratory studies the essential process of mRNA decay in the model Gram- positive bacterium, Bacillus subtilis. Rapid turnover of mRNA fragments is required to replenish ribonucleotide pools and to avoid non-productive translation on mRNA fragments. Relative to what is known about bacterial transcription and translation, much less is known about mRNA decay. All bacterial species contain a 3'-to-5' exoribonuclease, which degrades mRNA fragments that are generated by a decay-initiating endonuclease cleavage. Much evidence suggests that the key 3'-to-5' exonuclease in B. subtilis is polynucleotide phosphorylase (PNPase), encoded by the pnpA gene. RNA-Seq data show that 5'-proximal RNA fragments for hundreds of genes accumulate in a pnpA deletion strain. The current proposal aims to understand the specificity of mRNA turnover by PNPase and what compensates for PNPase in a pnpA deletion strain.  Structural studies suggest that RNA is threaded from its 3' end into a central channel of PNPase, which can only bind single-stranded RNA. Thus, efficient decay of mRNA that contains secondary structure may depend on RNA helicase activity. Preliminary data show that the major B. subtilis RNA helicase, CshA (encoded by the cshA gene) is required for rapid decay of some mRNA fragments. We propose to use new RNA-Seq protocols in B. subtilis ?pnpA and ?cshA strains to discover the nature of mRNA sequences that determine susceptibility to PNPase and dependence on CshA. The results of RNA-Seq experiments will guide genetic and biochemical experiments that probe the requirements for efficient PNPase-mediated decay. Available tools will be used to explore the relationship of PNPase-mediated decay to RNase Y (the major decay-initiating endonuclease), to ribosome flow, and to the ribosome rescue system. In addition, a unique screening method for determining susceptibility to decay is proposed. The screen promises to give insight into the nature of RNA sequences that are efficiently degraded by PNPase, and when there is a need for helicase activity.  Despite considerable accumulation of RNA fragments, a pnpA knockout strain grows well, indicating that some 3' exonuclease compensates for the loss of PNPase. The other three known 3' exoribonucleases of B. subtilis are likely not significantly involved in mRNA turnover. In preliminary experiments, we detect at least one 3' exonuclease activity in an extract of a strain that is missing all four of the known 3' exonucleases. The identity of this activity will be pursued using a biochemical approach, and its function in mRNA turnover will be studied. Discovery of an additional processive 3' exonuclease, which is not predicted from genome sequence, will impact greatly on our understanding of bacterial RNA processing and decay. RELEVANCE: Degradation of messenger RNA is an essential function of bacteria. A thorough understanding of the mechanism of mRNA decay will enable design of antimicrobial agents that disrupt this process and thereby interfere with bacterial cell growth."
"9604664","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The multi-PI proposal is to investigate how LRP4 regulates the formation of the neuromuscular junction (NMJ), a synapse that has contributed greatly to understanding of synaptogenesis and of neuromuscular disorders. NMJ formation requires precise interaction between motoneurons (MNs) and muscle fibers. In advance of MN arrival, muscle fibers are prepatterned with small, primitive AChR clusters, which are believed to be critical for NMJ formation although genetic evidence is lacking at the moment. In an established pathway, MNs release agrin to promote postsynaptic development. It binds to LRP4 which acts in cis to stimulate the receptor tyrosine kinase MuSK; and ensuing signaling events lead to AChR clustering. However, little is known of how signals are transduced from agrin to MuSK. In preliminary studies, we solved the first crystal structure of an agrin-LRP4 complex, which provides insight into the initial step of the agrin signaling cascade. Our studies of cell-specific knockout (KO) and double KO mice revealed novel functions of LRP4 in NMJ formation. For example, muscle LRP4 may be critical for presynaptic differentiation during initial steps of NMJ formation. On the other hand, MN LRP4 may serve as agrin's receptor in trans to induce AChR clusters. Many of these findings are unexpected and raise critical questions. How does LRP4 relay the signal from agrin to MuSK? Is MN LRP4 sufficient to induce NMJ formation? Is muscle fiber prepatterning critical for NMJ formation? Is the synaptogenic activity critical for NMJ formation? How does muscle LRP4 regulate motor nerve terminal differentiation? To address these questions, we will 1) understand how signal is transduced from LRP4 to MuSK by solving the structure of the agrin- LRP4-MuSK complex; 2) determine if MN LRP4 is sufficient to induce NMJ formation and if muscle fiber prepatterning is necessary for NMJ formation; and 3) investigate mechanisms by which LRP4 in muscle cells controls presynaptic differentiation. The research represents a synergistic strategy that leverages complementary expertise, strengths and existing resources of the two labs. Results will provide a better understanding of cellular as well as molecular mechanisms of mammalian NMJ formation. Pathogenesis of neuromuscular disorders is known to involve abnormal NMJ structure and function. In fact, mutations of agrin/LRP4/MuSK signaling proteins have been implicated in congenital myasthenic syndrome (CMS). Recent evidence from various laboratories including ours indicates that patients with myasthenia gravis (MG) develop antibodies against MuSK and LRP4. Therefore, our research will contribute to a better understanding of pathogenic mechanisms of these neuromuscular disorders."

The mission of the Cancer Data Sciences Program is to fulfill this potential across the spectrum of the efforts of the DF/HCC consortium. DF/HCC has a broad spectrum of research activities, a majority of which are data-intensive and require intellectual input and innovative contributions from Cancer Data Sciences Program members. As a consequence, the mission of the Program needs to be both broad and adaptable to the needs of the DF/HCC cancer research community. The program has 57 members, representing seven DF/HCC institutions and 11 academic departments. In 2014 peer-reviewed grant funding attributed to the Program was $5.4 million in total costs from the NCI and $4.4 million from other sponsors. During the current funding period, Cancer Data Sciences Program members published 1,259 cancer-relevant papers. Of these 45% were inter-institutional, 9% were intra-programmatic and 62% were inter-programmatic collaborations between two or more DF/HCC members. Overall, when counted once, 27% of DF/HCC publications were inter-programmatic collaborations."
"9417948","Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a popular brain stimulation technique used by clinical and nonclinical researchers because it is noninvasive and relatively simple to implement. This fact is reflected by over 250 active clinical trials1 to treat various neurological2?4 and psychiatric diseases, as well as innumerable studies with healthy human subjects. The motor system is a common target in these studies, and research suggests that tDCS can improve recovery following stroke2?6, boost motor learning7?10, and increase motor cortex excitability11,12. In addition, tDCS is now being used to probe the brain on the assumption that it can modulate specific networks depending upon the electrode montage13. Despite its popularity, tDCS remains controversial because results are highly variable14,15, and basic understanding about the mechanism of action is lacking16. Due to overwhelming adoption in human trials and basic research, it is more important than ever to understand the physiological effects of tDCS. Some animal experiments have worked towards this goal by pairing tDCS with intracortical recordings17?19. However, these studies apply tDCS in rodents at currents far outside the range seen in human trials, and often under general anesthesia. We plan to build on this with two basic improvements: we will use monkeys trained in a motor task to study the effects of tDCS on the active and resting cortex, and we will deliver tDCS at levels similar to those used in human studies. Our experiments are designed to explore three fundamental physiological predictions drawn from behavioral effects. 1) We will test the hypothesis that cathodal and anodal tDCS have opposite modulatory effects on cortical activity, and that these effects persist for hours after tDCS is turned off. To measure these changes, we will record the spike activity of dozens of single neurons (single unit activity, SUA) and 96 channels of network activity (local field potential, LFP) in the motor cortex before, during, after tDCS. We will also use a novel, battery- powered computer called the NeuroChip to record SUA and LFP for at least 12 hours after tDCS is turned off. 2) We will test whether different tDCS electrode montages can alter functional connectivity of the cortex by measuring the responses, called the cortically-evoked potential (cEP), across cortical sites during tDCS. 3) We will determine whether tDCS enhances cortical plasticity by tracking Hebbian changes in cEP induced by paired- pulse conditioning of two cortical sites. This question is important because tDCS modulation of plasticity is presumed to be the main way that tDCS boosts efficacy of traditional therapy for neurological disease20. Confirmation of these predictions stemming from human trials would not only encourage the continued use of tDCS, but provide critical information about its mechanism of action and inform future human studies."
"9471671","Project Summary: The cardiac thin filament is the essential regulator of cardiac contractility and relaxation at the molecular level. It is comprised of five discrete proteins: cTnC, cTnI, cTnT, actin and tropomyosin that have co-evolved to sustain efficient cardiac performance at rest, during exercise and, importantly, to respond to pathologic stressors. Mutations in genes encoding each of these proteins have been definitively linked to the development of a range of human genetic cardiomyopathies, including hypertrophic (HCM) and dilated (DCM) forms. Despite 25 years of study to define the direct link(s) between the biophysical insult and the resultant complex cardiomyopathy, many questions remain and significantly limit our ability to use genotype to prognosticate and inform patient management. Recent clinical studies based on genotyped cohorts have established that the earliest stages of pathogenic remodeling precedes the development of overt cardiac hypertrophy or dilatation. This seminal observation raises the possibility that early therapeutic intervention focusing on the earliest molecular ?triggers? may prove successful in slowing the natural history of these complex disorders. To test this hypothesis, the current application builds on our prior funding period where we developed an innovative integrated approach to probing thin filament-linked HCM and DCM that incorporates computation, biophysics and whole-heart physiology. We have identified two distinct, common pathogenic pathways to study. In Aim 1 we will delineate the dynamic role of the Tropomyosin overlap domain and the coupled allosteric regulation by the cardiac Troponin T N terminus on the differential cardiac remodeling that defines hypertrophic and dilated cardiomyopathies linked to known mutations in the flexible tropomyosin overlap. And in Aim 2 we will define the potential modulatory role of altered cTnC Ca2+ dissociation kinetics in the activation of CaMKII signaling as a nodal point in the pathogenesis of sarcomeric hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. The successful completion of these Aims will both reveal novel disease mechanisms and directly test the potential for altering the natural history of genetic HCM and DCM."
"9453447","Project Summary Recent studies have shown a beneficial effect of cardiosphere-derived cell (CDC) therapy on regeneration of injured myocardium following myocardial infarction (MI). While paracrine signaling by CDC secreted exosomes (CDC-exo) is hypothesized to be the principal mediator of improved function, the contribution of exosomes secreted from grafted cells and their mechanisms of action have not been established. Our central hypothesis is that exosomes released by engrafted CDCs directly contribute to cardioprotection. We have previously shown that human CDC-derived exosomes have a primarily anti-apoptotic effect on cardiac myocytes and antiproliferative effect on cardiac fibroblasts. Furthermore, we found that macrophages primed with CDC-exo are polarized towards an anti-inflammatory phenotype with high expression of Arg1. Together, our studies support a role for exosome secretion as a paracrine mechanism of stem cell-mediated cardiac repair in vivo. Using a novel genetic lentiviral knockdown strategy to inhibit neutral sphingomyelinase 2 (nSMase2), a crucial enzyme in exosome secretion, we will test constitutive inhibition of CDC exosome secretion in vivo, enabling us to achieve our long term goal of determining the functional relevance and mechanism of cardiosphere-derived cell exosomes on the restoration of cardiac function. We will define the role of physiologically secreted CDC-exo on cardiac function post MI, elucidate the contribution of CDC-exo-modulated macrophage polarization on cardioprotection, and define the functional role of exosomal miRNA in CDC-exo mediated effects. In doing so, we aim to identify novel therapeutic approaches to stimulate cardiac muscle regeneration that do not require the administration of stem cell preparations and can potentially enhance the care of patients with both heart failure and prior myocardial infarction. Success in achieving our specific aims is of high impact as there are few pharmacological targets capable of influencing cardiac regeneration. The following proposal details a five-year career development and training plan for Dr. Jennifer Lang, a new Assistant Professor in the Department of Medicine at the University at Buffalo, under the mentorship of Dr. John M. Canty, Jr. Her proposal is strengthened by her strong institutional commitment, as evidenced by their financial support and allocation of dedicated research space, technical assistance and access to all core facilities. Her career development plan further leverages the extensive resources offered by the University, the Department, and UB?s CTSA Program to bring together strong practical and didactic training as well as a mentorship committee of experts in animal physiology, myocardial remodeling, nanoparticles, and magnetic resonance imaging. Receipt of an NIH K08 Award will allow Dr. Lang to obtain the necessary support and training needed to develop expertise in the skills essential for her to achieve her long-term career goal of becoming a successful independent investigator."
"9591101","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The objective of this work is to create and validate a platform for engineering phage-based antimicrobials that share a common scaffold and are generalizable to target a broad range of bacterial pathogens, which we call phagebodies. Our phagebody technology will be used to create efficacious, well-defined, and targeted antimicrobials against carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE). CRE are resistant to nearly all antibiotics, and thus there is a tremendous unmet clinical need for new anti-CRE treatment strategies.  Bacteriophages enact targeted killing of specific bacteria without affecting neighboring bacteria. These narrow-spectrum agents differ significantly from most chemical antibiotics, which exhibit broad-spectrum activity and can therefore generate undesirable side effects such as Clostridium difficile overgrowth and selection for antibiotic resistance. Furthermore, the antibiotic pipeline for pathogens such as CRE is dwindling.  However, for narrow-spectrum agents such as phages to be useful in clinical settings, technologies for the extensible and high-throughput creation of targeted phage therapeutics are critically needed. In conventional phage therapy, cocktails of naturally isolated phages are constructed to cover a broad set of a given target bacteria. This approach poses several difficulties for the use of phage therapy in Western clinical settings. Natural phage cocktails are often composed of phages from diverse families, thus posing challenges for characterization and manufacturing under conditions needed for clinical application. In addition, natural phage isolation protocols are reliant on environmental sampling and screening, which can be laborious and challenging to scale to cover a broad range of perpetually evolving bacterial targets.  Here, we will create and optimize a novel strategy for engineering well-defined and customizable phagebodies as antimicrobials. In preliminary studies, we have shown that common phage scaffolds can be retargeted against new bacterial hosts by modular tail fiber swapping or mutagenesis of host-recognition domains within tail fiber tips. We will extend these findings to create highly diversified phage banks that will be screened against panels of carbapenem-resistant E. coli and K. pneumoniae to identify efficacious phages that kill these bacteria. These phages shall be validated and optimized within in vitro and in vivo models of infection.  This work is significant since it will provide an extensible technological platform to discover effective phage-based antimicrobials that can be further advanced into preclinical and clinical development against urgent threats, such as CRE and other pathogens. This work is innovative since it involves the novel creation of tailored phagebody antimicrobials that overcome prior challenges associated with natural phage therapy."
"9397506","Abstract Exercise is a powerful and pleiotropic physiological stimulus that helps prevent many chronic diseases and is used as a therapeutic for disease. While the beneficial effects of exercise are extensively acknowledged there is still very little understood about the molecular transducers of the systems-wide effects. The goal of this University of Florida Molecular Transducers of Physical Activity Preclinical Animal Study Sites application (UF PASS) is to conduct experiments in animals that will provide tissues/blood (i.e. biospecimens) to the Chemical Analysis Sites for identification of molecular transducers induced by defined models of physical activity from tissues that cannot be obtained from humans as well as to conduct mechanistic studies that can support screening of novel transducers to quickly move the field forward. In Phase 1, UF PASS proposes to collect biospecimens for the Chemical Analysis sites following endurance (run-training) or resistance exercise protocols on male and female Fischer 344xBrown Norway rats (F344-BN) at three different ages. To better capture the dynamics of the exercise/adaptation responses we propose to: 1) Collect biospecimens at 5 selected timepoints following an acute bout of exercise on naïve and trained rats; 2) Collect biospecimens following short duration training (after 5 bouts) and 3) Collect biospecimens following long-term (8 weeks) training. For Phase 2, our hypothesis is that factors released from muscle (i.e. myokines) are the molecular transducers that function throughout the system to improve the well-established stress tolerance. The goal of these studies will be to employ high throughput screening technologies to test up to 1500 myokines. We will then use secondary screening techniques to test 100 candidates from which we will select up to 3 candidates for in vivo testing. The results of the experiments in Aim 3 will provide molecular evidence identifying a set of transducers, released from muscle, that are necessary for exercise induced systemic health. The goals of the UF PASS will be pursued by the following Specific Aims: Specific Aim 1: Center Coordination Phase. Specific Aim 2: Phase 1 Studies. To perform endurance and resistance exercise using male and female F344BN rats at 3-4, 16-18, and 27-29 mo. Specific Aim 3: Phase 2 Studies. The goal in Aim 3 is to test myokines as the exercise transducers for improved stress tolerance."
"9446695","Project Summary Low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) is a major risk factor for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), the leading cause of death. However, strategies to improve atheroprotection by raising HDL-C levels have failed to improve outcomes. Macrophage- specific cholesterol efflux is the first critical step of reverse cholesterol transport, a key atheroprotective pathway. Cholesterol efflux is inversely associated with incident ASCVD events; however, the mechanisms that underlie variation in cholesterol efflux are unknown. There is a critical need to identify factors that regulate cholesterol efflux to advance understanding of the reverse cholesterol transport pathway, a biological process that has broad implications across a variety of disease states including atherosclerosis. The overall objective of this proposal is to systematically ascertain the genetic and molecular factors governing variation in cholesterol efflux. We propose to carry out our objective by using two large, population- based multi-ethnic cohorts, the Dallas Heart Study (DHS) and the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) to pursue the following aims: 1) determine the contribution of genetic factors to inter-individual variability in cholesterol efflux and whether these factors are causally associated with ASCVD; and 2) identify the metabolite and protein signature of cholesterol efflux in a sex- and ethnicity-specific manner. We expect to characterize the genetic, metabolic, and protein regulators of cholesterol efflux to support future studies targeting manipulation of the reverse cholesterol transport pathway."

"9464331","Project Summary/Abstract In silico toxicology is an important alternative approach to animal testing that provides a fast and inexpensive prediction of toxicity. It uses computer models to predict whether a chemical is safe or if there is a potential hazard. In silico methods are particularly valuable when a decision needs to be made quickly, such as for an emergency response to a chemical spill or when there is little or no test material available such as for an assessment of metabolites. Unfortunately, there are a number of obstacles to performing such analyses. Although running the models is fast, the whole process of making predictions, including selecting and acquiring the models, interpreting the results, performing an expert review, and documenting the results, can be time-consuming. It is also difficult to defend the results, primarily due to a lack of published procedures for performing an in silico assessment. To support the development of such protocols, a 44-member international cross-industry consortium has been assembled. This consortium is led by Leadscope and includes representatives from international regulatory agencies and government research laboratories in the United States, Canada, Japan and Europe, as well as large companies from various industrial sectors e.g., pharmaceutical, food, cosmetics, agrochemicals , academic groups and other stakeholders. This consortium will publish in silico protocols for seven major toxicological endpoints: 1 skin/respiratory/oral sensitization, 2 repeated dose toxicity, 3 carcinogenicity, 4 reproductive and developmental toxicity, 5 endocrine activity and disruptors, 6 liver toxicity and 7 persistence, bioaccumulation and environmental toxicity. The protocols will ensure any in silico assessments are performed in a consistent, repeatable, well-documented and defendable manner. This proposal also outlines the development of a first to market software platform Leadscope® Rapid Response that will make toxicity assessments based upon these generally accepted and published protocols. For each major endpoint, a five step methodology for incorporating assessments into the rapid response platform is outlined. This process starts with the development and publication of the protocol. An exercise to understand the structure-activity relationships SAR across public and proprietary databases will be initiated, without revealing any confidential information. A specialized database containing the necessary information on specific studies, as defined in the protocols, will be created. This database and SAR knowledge are then used to build and enhance different computational methodologies and these models and decision frameworks, as outlined in the published protocols, will be integrated into the platform. The platform will be commercialized and made available broadly at a low annual cost, with separate subscription licensing of the models, databases and other tools for integration of proprietary data and knowledge. There will also be a pay-as-you-go pricing option to ensure access for smaller organizations. The successful deployment of this technology provides a significant commercial opportunity for Leadscope Inc. and will support increased productivity for those companies involved in chemical research and development e.g. pharmaceutical companies, agrochemical companies, cosmetics, industrial chemicals and a significant reduction in animal tests."
"9598068","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The 3rd most commonly mutated gene in lung adenocarcinoma is the kinase LKB1 (STK11), where ~25,000 patients have this mutation. Patients that are co-mutated for LKB1 and KRAS have significantly shorter overall survival compared to either mutation alone and have no effective targeted therapies. In a genetically engineered Kras mouse model, co-mutation of Lkb1 is sufficient to promote metastasis of lung adenocarcinoma, and primary tumors and metastases show aberrant activation of both EMT and adhesion signaling. In agreement with these data, we have published three reports that LKB1 regulates lung cancer motility and when present, restrict the activity of a key adhesion signaling molecule, focal adhesion kinase (FAK). Moreover, our preliminary data show that Lkb1-deficient tumor cells invade as a collective pack in vivo, and in doing so, remodel the collagen ECM of the tumor microenvironment, a phenomenon that is dependent on the activity of FAK in vitro. These metastatic tumors from the mouse model show aberrant FAK activation within collective invasion packs of the primary tumors. Therefore, we hypothesize that LKB1-mutant cells use EMT to initially invade through the basement membrane, which is followed by defective FAK-based adhesion signaling that allows cells to navigate the collagen microenvironment during metastasis. To test this, we will take a multi-model approach that combines the power of Drosophila and mouse genetics, and our large clinically annotated human lung adenocarcinoma tumor bank to i) test the mechanism and signaling pathway used by Lkb1-mutant cells to traverse the basement membrane, ii) determine whether altered adhesion signaling drives in vivo cell escape through collagen remodeling, and iii) determine whether LKB1-mutant human lung adenocarcinoma exhibits altered adhesion signaling that correlates with collagen remodeling and predicts poor outcome. We propose that this comprehensive approach can overcome the shortcomings of traditional in vitro systems and address our goal of defining the biological consequences of LKB1 mutations in lung cancer patients."
"9397565","Project Abstract Heart disease is a major cause of morbidity and mortality, much of it due to ischemic injury. Mitophagy and biogenesis (mitochondrial turnover) are essential for ischemia tolerance and appropriate recovery during reperfusion. Factors that affect mitochondrial turnover include age, sex, time of day, comorbid conditions such as age and metabolic syndrome, nutritional status, exercise, and a long list of drugs and natural products. The overarching hypothesis is that monitoring mitochondrial turnover will allow us to infer a patient?s response to ischemic stress, and that normalizing turnover will improve outcome. In this proposal we develop tools to measure mitochondrial turnover (Aim I), define the regulation of mitochondrial turnover (Aim II), and leverage the knowledge gained to monitor mitochondrial turnover in the human heart during cardiopulmonary bypass (Aim III). Additionally we will measure mitochondrial function in endomyocardial biopsies of heart transplant patients, where it will be possible to relate mitochondrial function to cardiac contractility. In Aim I we will use our novel MitoTimer mice and organelle flow cytometry to develop a proteomic signature of mitophagy and biogenesis. The protein profiles will be used to create a mass spectrometry assay (multiple reaction monitoring, MRM) to infer mitochondrial turnover in tissue extracts including human heart biopsies. This index of mitophagy and biogenesis will be used to assess mitochondrial turnover in rodents in Aim I and in human heart biopsies in Aim III. In Aim II, we will delineate the regulation of mitophagy by PINK1, Parkin, and optineurin; and the regulation of mitochondrial biogenesis by PGC-1alpha, PARIS, and translational machinery. We have established polysome profiling to interrogate translational control of mitochondrial biogenesis. In Aim III we will use paired atrial biopsies (before and after cardiopulmonary bypass) to characterize mitophagy and biogenesis in the human heart?s response to ischemic stress; we will use paired atrial and ventricular biopsies to gain much-needed information about the differences in mitochondrial function and cardiac proteome; and we will correlate mitochondrial respirometry, mtDNA damage, and MRM assays of mitochondrial turnover to correlate with clinical parameters, specifically postoperative atrial fibrillation. These studies will establish the molecular signatures of appropriate mitochondrial turnover during cardiac surgery, providing markers of target engagement that will position us to evaluate therapeutic interventions. Importantly, understanding this pathway will reveal new therapeutic targets that regulate mitochondrial turnover and influence function of the human heart recovering from ischemia."
"9442207","Project Summary Our long term goal is to identify cellular and molecular mechanisms responsible for fasting-induced cardioprotection. Excessive calorie intake leads to increased risk for cardiovascular disease. On the contrary, intermittent fasting and caloric restriction can enhance cardiovascular health. Intensive research has focused on developing drugs that mimic the health-promoting effects of fasting without actually reducing food intake. However, the cardioprotective mechanisms remain speculative, making it hard to design mimetics for harnessing the full benefits of fasting. Mitochondrial autophagy or mitophagy is the process in which mitochondria are specifically delivered to and degraded in the lysosomes. Mitophagy has been shown to play an important role in maintaining cardiac homeostasis under various conditions. However, it remains completely unknown whether mitophagy is beneficial to the heart during fasting. Our preliminary studies showed that fasting accelerated mitophagy flux in the heart as determined by multiple measurements including a novel dual fluorescent mitophagy reporter. Although cardiac function was normal after 1-day fasting, it was impaired by 2-day starvation. Together, these results not only demonstrate the ability of fasting to induce mitophagy in the heart but also suggest a potential role of mitophagy in modulating cardiac function during fasting. We hypothesize that an appropriate level of mitophagy is essential for maintaining cardiac homeostasis during fasting-induced energy crisis. This hypothesis will be tested in two specific aims. Using genetically modified mice with reduced mitophagy in the heart, Aim 1 will investigate whether reducing cardiac mitophagy will lead to an accumulation of dysfunctional mitochondria, exacerbating fasting-induced cardiac injury. A novel mitophagy reporter will be used to directly visualize and quantify mitophagy in the heart. The relative importance of two mitophagy pathways, namely, Parkin and FUNDC1, in maintaining cardiac homeostasis during fasting will be determined. Using transgenic mice overexpressing Parkin or FUNDC1, Aim 2 will determine if increasing mitophagy is sufficient to enhance the degradation and recycling of dysfunctional mitochondria, rendering the heart resistant to fasting-induced injury. Successful completion of the proposed study will provide novel insight into the signaling mechanisms that mediate the cardioprotective effects of fasting and facilitate the targeted-design of effective mimetics to harness the power of fasting for preventive and therapeutic intervention in heart disease. This R15 grant will also have a very positive impact on the research environment and student learning at our institution by supporting the conduct of significant research and by engaging students of all levels in the research activities."
"9447277","Gangliosides are glycosylated sphingolipids with essential but enigmatic function in brain development and neural stem cell (NSC) maintenance. A critical barrier to our knowledge on ganglioside function in the brain is the absence of a systematic approach targeting key regulatory mechanisms in NSC differentiation instructed by gangliosides. Our group has pioneered research on the importance of gangliosides for growth factor receptor signaling and epigenetic regulation of NSCs. The overall goal of this project is to further elucidate the functional roles of gangliosides in NSCs based on contemporary concepts and technologies. The primary localization of glycosphingolipids (GSLs) on cell-surface microdomains and the drastic dose and composition changes during neural differentiation strongly suggest that GSLs are not only important as biomarkers but also are involved in modulating NSC functions. Many stage-specific GSL antigens in NSCs are now known, but less is understood about the mechanisms for their biological functions in modulating NSC cell fate determination. Here we will perform cellular and molecular biological analyses to elucidate the expression patterns of gangliosides, the functional roles of gangliosides in growth factor activation, and the mechanisms in regulating glycosyltransferases (GTs) during neural differentiation. The overall goal will be achieved by the following three specific aims: 1) To determine the expression of gangliosides in NSCs and the functional roles of specific gangliosides in relation to specific growth factors and their receptors for regulating NSC cell fate determination, such as self-renewal, proliferation, differentiation, migration, and survival. This will be achieved by investigation of stage-specific gangliosides in growth factor-mediated cellular events in normal and GT knockout mice; 2) To determine the regulatory mechanisms of GT expression in NSCs that account for the dramatic changes of ganglioside expression (?pathway switch?) during differentiation. In particular, we will study the post-translational regulation of GT expression by a novel enzyme complex formation mechanism at key metabolic branching points of their biosynthesis; and 3) To determine a novel epigenetic regulatory mechanism of GT expression in neuronal differentiation, particularly during postnatal neurogenesis. We will test the hypothesis that nuclear GM1 is associated with gene regulation in neuronal cells. Since GSL expression profiles are associated not only with normal development but also with pathogenic mechanisms of diseases, the proposed studies will significantly enhance the understanding of the functional role of GSLs in neurogenesis and the molecular mechanisms underlying the differential expression of stage-specific GSLs. This information will be extremely useful in providing novel strategies for disease treatment and neural regeneration by NSCs."

"9444875","The marked increase in cardiovascular disease (CVD) in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) demands an integrated approach to cardiometabolic disease. A major goal of the PI's lab is to elucidate common mechanisms in distinct cell types that contribute to both insulin resistance and atherosclerosis. We have shown that obesity/insulin resistance and atherosclerosis activate a CaMKII/MK2 kinase pathway in hepatocytes (HCs) and macrophages (M s), respectively. In HCs, this pathway disrupts insulin receptor signaling, leading to systemic insulin resistance, and also down-regulates tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), which predicts higher risk of atherosclerotic CVD. In M s, the pathway promotes plaque progression by impairing apoptotic cell clearance (efferocytosis) and inflammation resolution. We have evidence that part of the mechanism involves CaMKII-mediated suppression of LXR . Additional data suggest that the HC pathway, by inducing hyperinsulinemia, amplifies the lesional M pathway, which predicts exacerbated plaque progression. In this context, the overall objective is to investigate the mechanisms and consequences of the CaMKII/MK2 pathways in HCs and M s in metabolism and atherosclerosis. In Aim 1, we will investigate the role of M CaMKII in advanced atherosclerosis and its exacerbation by insulin resistance. We hypothesize that the CaMKII/MK2 pathway in M s promotes advanced atherosclerosis by impairing resolution and by down- regulating LXR , which disrupts MerTK-mediated efferocytosis. To test this hypothesis, we will use WD-fed Ldlr-/- mice with myeloid-CaMKII KO, with or without other alterations, e.g., suppressed myeloid LXR and MerTK. We will also feed the mice an atherogenic/diabetogenic diet to test the hypothesis that the M CaMKII pathway will be exacerbated by insulin resistance via suppression of M IR signaling (above) and that suppression of myeloid-CaMKII KO will dampen this exacerbation and its consequences. In Aim 2, we will test the hypothesis that activation of the CaMKII/MK2 pathway in HCs in obesity promotes atherosclerosis by at least two mechanisms. First, hyperinsulinemia down-regulates insulin signaling in M s, elevates cytoplasmic calcium, and activates CaMKII, which is a direct link to Aim 1. Second, we have exciting new in vivo data that the HC pathway suppresses circulating tPA activity, and low tPA is a risk factor for atherosclerotic CVD, with relevance to T2D. We will test the hypothesis that silencing the CaMKII pathway in HCs in insulin-resistant Ldlr-/- mice will lessen advanced atherosclerosis by suppressing the M pathways outlined in Aim 1 and also by increasing tPA. Then, based on our recent publication, we will treat the mice with a specific inhibitor of the pathway to (a) intervene in a temporal manner to study the role of the pathway in atherosclerosis progression and regression; and (b) as a proof-of-concept test of the therapeutic potential of our discoveries. In summary, successful completion of this proposal will offer new mechanistic insight and potential therapeutic targets related to the integrated problem of cardiometabolic disease, which is a deadly and expanding epidemic."
"9457203","The ultimate success of immunotherapy for brain malignancies, such as malignant glioma, will require integration of in-depth understanding of immunology with solutions for the following long-standing challenges: 1) paucity and heterogeneous expression of glioma-specific antigens; 2) poor homing and persistence of effector cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs); and 3) glioma-induced immunosuppression. My laboratory has been contributing to critical discoveries in each of these areas, and integrated our findings into novel immunotherapy clinical trials for glioma patients.

We hypothesize that integration of novel cell-engineering and antigen-targeting approaches will allow us to develop safer and more effective immunotherapy strategies by overcoming heterogeneous expression of antigens and unique challenges in brain immunology. We will evaluate the following strategies: 1. Novel glioma neoantigens for safe and effective immunotherapy. We will leverage our current NINDS awards (R01NS096954 and R21NS093654) and characterize T-cell receptors (TCRs) specific to neoantigens derived from both pediatric and adult gliomas. 2. Sequential chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)/TCR system for targeting multiple antigens. As a way to safely target glioma-associated antigens (GAAs) in the tumor microenvironment without damaging normal cells outside of the brain, we will evaluate the novel sequential Synthetic Notch (synNotch) CAR/TCR system, in which antigen signaling through the first CAR or TCR against a tumor-specific antigen induces the second, anti-GAA CAR/TCR to trigger the CTL activity at the tumor site. 3. Targeting the glioma immune environment by creating tertiary lymphoid organs (TLOs). The absence of lymphatic organs and professional antigen presenting cells are thought to be major reasons for insufficient immune responses in the brain. We will evaluate whether induction of TLOs in the brain tumor site will facilitate efficient and long-lasting glioma antigen-specific immune responses in the brain tumor site. These 3 strategies will be logically integrated into combination approaches. Novel antigens and TCRs will be adopted into the synNotch CAR/TCR system, and the TLO approach would also be most beneficial when combined with the synNotch CAR/TCR system. As expected per the purpose of the NINDS R35 mechanism, these strategies may involve high risks. However, based on our proof-of-principle preliminary data, we will persistently pursue our goals with the long-term support by the R35 mechanism, and flexibly and swiftly adopt new technologies. These studies will also integrate with other areas of ongoing studies in our lab. For example, oncolytic virus-mediated expression of target antigen and CTL-attracting chemokine (?payload? approaches) would help us to overcome the paucity and heterogeneous expression of antigens as well as tumor homing of CTLs to the glioma tissue. The R35 would allow these integrations."

"9443499","ABSTRACT Several interventions for mental health problems are efficacious and effective, but few are routinely offered to college students, who represent 59% of young adults. This is regrettable because college students are at high risk for mental health problems (e.g., depression, substance abuse, eating disorders), and college counseling centers lack sufficient clinicians to offer individual therapy to all afflicted students and are not well positioned to deliver prevention programs. One solution for this service shortfall is to have peer educators deliver scripted group-based prevention programs, which can more efficiently reduce the burden of mental illness than individual therapy. Targeting college students is a cost-effective tactic for delivering prevention programs and has vast potential reach because 85% of colleges have peer educator programs. Peer educators have effectively delivered several prevention programs, sometimes producing larger effects than clinicians, as was the case in a preliminary trial of a group-based prevention program with a particularly strong evidence-base. Guided by Wandersman et al. (2012), we propose to evaluate 3 levels of implementation support (training, technical assistance, and quality assurance/improvement) for the delivery of a prevention program. We will randomize 45 colleges to: (1) a Training condition where experts provide an intensive discrete 2-day initial train-the-trainer workshop that simultaneously trains peer educators to deliver the intervention and campus supervisors to train and support future peer educators, plus the facilitator guide and facilitator support website; (2) a Training + Technical Assistance condition, adding a ½ day implementation training to articulate goals, needs, leadership structure, adoption options, recruitment strategies, and communication; or (3) a Training + Technical Assistance + Quality Assurance/Quality Improvement condition adding 1 year of technical assistance, coaching, and quality assurance to enhance implementation skills and sustainability. We will test whether greater implementation support is associated with graded increases in fidelity and competence in delivering the scripted prevention program (Aim 1), student attendance of the intervention and effectiveness of the program on pre-to-post changes in outcomes compared to usual care data collected before implementation (Aim 2), and reach and sustainability of the program (Aim 3). We will test whether Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) indices of perceived intervention characteristics, outer and inner setting factors, peer educator attributes, and process factors after the initial training correlate with fidelity, competence, attendance, effectiveness, reach, and sustainability over the implementation period and test whether at the end of the initial 1-year implementation period the 3 conditions differ on relevant CFIR indices and on the progress and timing of implementation (Aim 4). We will evaluate the prevention program delivery cost in the 3 conditions and the relative cost-effectiveness of each condition in terms of attaining intervention fidelity, competence, attendance, effectiveness, reach, and sustainability, as well as general cost-savings at the clinics (Aim 5)."
"9391982","ABSTRACT  The Immunology (IM) program is devoted to enhancing our understanding of the function of the innate and  adaptive immune system in the pathogenesis of malignant disease. There are three broad themes in the  program?(1) innate immunity and the role of checkpoint innate sensors in the initiation of malignant disease;  (2) adaptive immunity and the role of effector and regulatory T cells and B cells in the biology of malignant  disease and graft-versus-host disease (GVHD); and (3) tumor vaccines and translational immunotherapy. The  last theme focuses on nanoparticle delivery and vaccine development and a new area using modified T cells  for adoptive cellular therapy. Significant highlights of the program have been seminal discoveries regarding  the negative immunoregulatory role of innate sensing proteins and their role in cancer development, the  generation of a novel mouse model to investigate viral induced carcinogenesis in the liver, completion of the  largest clinical trial combining an antibody and tumor vaccine approach given with chemotherapy for the  treatment of women with metastatic breast cancer and novel findings regarding the function of  immunosuppressive pathways and immune cells in the growth of solid tumors. The third programmatic area,  translational immunotherapy, is greatly enhanced by the building in 2015 of the sole cellular expansion GMP  facility in the state of North Carolina and plans for genetically modified autologous T cell infusions for the  treatment of patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, multiple myeloma and Hodgkin lymphoma in 2016.  Five high profile recruits, including three junior faculty members, Edward Miao PhD, Maureen Su MD PhD, and  Yuliya Pylayeva-Gupta PhD, and two senior recruits from the Cell and Gene Therapy Program at Baylor  University of Medicine, Gianpietro Dotti MD and Barbara Savoldo MD PhD have joined the program since the  last submission. The program is led by Jenny Ting PhD Kenan Professor of Genetics and the leader of the  Translational Immunology Center at the University of North Carolina who is a world's expert on the function of  proteins that mediate innate immune responses, and Jonathan Serody MD Thomas Professor of Medicine,  Microbiology and Immunology and the Associate Director for Translational Sciences in the Cancer Center who  is an expert on the biology of GVHD and tumor vaccines and the tumor microenvironment. There are 19  program members from five different departments in the Medical School. During the last funding period,  program members have published 406 cancer-related articles (28% collaborative).

"9436400","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Parkinson?s disease (PD) is a severe, second most common neurodegenerative disorder which is still poorly understood and has few current treatment options. The clinical phenotype of PD is caused by the selective degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta in the ventral midbrain. Early- onset PD accounts for 4-10% of all PD patients and autosomal recessive mutations in DJ1 have been associated with some of these PD cases. DJ1 is a mitochondrial protein encoded by the PARK7 gene, and plays a role in transcriptional regulation, kinase activity regulation, protein ubiquitination and oxidative stress. Mutations in DJ1 have been associated with mitochondrial dysfunction seen in PD, however the exact mechanism of how DJ1 mutations contribute to PD pathogenesis remains unclear. Recently, human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-based PD models generated insight into the pathobiology of mutations in a number of other PD- associated genes, such as LRKK2, SNCA, Parkin and PINK1. However, no such human in vitro model exists for studying the impact of DJ1 mutations on mitochondrial function and PD etiology. Here we propose to combine hiPSC-technology with TALEN- and CRISPR/Cas9-based gene editing approaches to; 1) generate a cohort of isogenic DJ1 mutation containing lines with either the c.317_322del or c.T497C mutation; generate 2 different mitochondrial function iPSC reporter lines (GFP-LC3B and HyPer-GFP) to assay mitophagy/autophagy and mitochondrial morphology/ROS production. Upon dopaminergic (DA) differentiation of gene edited isogenic lines, samples will be collected at iPSC, midbrain floorplate progenitor and mature DA neuron stage, and used for transcriptional profiling. Assays analyzing ROS production, mitochondrial movement and morphology will be used to evaluate mitochondrial function in gene edited DJ1 mutation and control iPSC-derived DA neurons. DA neuron differentiation of mitochondrial reporter lines with gene edited DJ1 mutations will provide additional insights into the impact of DJ1 mutations on mitochondrial function in PD. The outcome of this work will not only provide new insights into DJ1 function in mitochondrial function, but also provide a powerful new resource for probing mitochondrial function in neurodegenerative disease."
"9423472","Summary  In the United States, perinatal brain injury (PBI) is a major cause of infant mortality and long-term disability in children. For a large proportion of infants with PBI, central nervous system (CNS) injury begins in utero with inflammation (chorioamnionitis/CHORIO) and/or hypoxia-ischemia. CHORIO contributes to preterm CNS injury, and is also a common, independent risk factor for brain injury in term infants, including perinatal stroke. However, the molecular mechanisms mediating inflammation in the placenta-fetal-brain axis that cause PBI remains a gap in knowledge. The chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 1 (CXCL1) and its receptor (CXCR2) have been clinically implicated in CHORIO, and are essential to neutrophil recruitment, neural cell development and adult CNS injury, although their specific role in PBI pathophysiology is completely undefined. We propose to use our established and unique model of CNS injury associated with CHORIO to delineate how in utero inflammation precipitates PBI. Our central hypothesis is that CXCL1 secreted by the choriodecidua during CHORIO enters fetal blood, transcends the placenta-fetus-fetal brain axis, and through interactions on CXCR2+ neural cells and neutrophil recruitment, confers injury in the developing CNS. We posit that CHORIO is defined by excess CXCL1/CXCR2 signaling, which is toxic to neural cells over an extended neurodevelopmental period. To investigate this hypothesis we will: 1) Test that CHORIO disturbs CXCL1/CXCR2 signaling throughout the placenta-fetus-fetal brain axis during a critical period of late gestation CNS development; 2) Test that placental CXCL1 translocates to the fetal brain and modulates neutrophils and microglia; and 3) Test that attenuation of CXCL1/CXCR2 signal transduction protects neural cells following CHORIO. Using multiplex electrochemiluminescent immunoassay (MECI), flow cytometry (FC), and qPCR we will investigate whether CHORIO induced CXCL1/CXCL2 signaling is a unifying inflammatory signal transduction mechanism through the placenta-fetus-fetal brain axis. Using in vitro assays, including exosome analyses, placental explants and acute brain slices, we will drive CXCL1/CXCR2, and define the major molecular mediators of damage to the placenta-fetus-fetal brain axis. Using immunoneutralization, microRNA, pharmacological (SB225002), and genetic (CXCR2 KO) approaches, we will delineate whether CXCL1/CXCR2 is necessary and sufficient for immune cell recruitment to the CNS following CHORIO. We predict creating a transient CXCR2 deficiency following CHORIO will attenuate microglial activation and neutrophil recruitment, mitigate white matter and neuronal injury, and improve microstructural coherence on magnetic resonance imaging. These investigations will be the first to connect aberrant CXCL1/CXCR2 signaling in the placenta- fetal-brain axis to chronic injury and impaired neurodevelopment, and will define novel targets for directed therapies for infants at high risk for PBI. !"
"9391961","ABSTRACT  Developmental Funds support the Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center (LCCC) mission directly through  the provision of resources and indirectly by leveraging institutional and philanthropic assets. Collectively, these  resources expand and enhance cancer research across LCCC in the basic, clinical, population and  translational sciences. During the last five years, these funds have been used to make key recruitments, to  launch innovative ideas, and to make technical advances within our Shared Resources. Through these  expenditures, the LCCC bolstered interdisciplinary and translational research efforts. By objective criteria, e.g.  extramural grants funded, and junior faculty garnering national awards, our recruitment and retention efforts  have been a stunning success. Our range of pilot project awards have initiated new research across the  clinical, population, translational, and basic spectrum, again yielding success in seeding extramural grant  funding, broad collaborations, and cancer related publications. The funds provided for Shared Resources have  developed new techniques, particularly those translating fundamental discoveries into clinical applications. A  decision by NCI three years into this cycle allowed expenditures of Developmental Funds for projects outside  the borders of the United States. We were please to utilize this capability to fund pilot projects in our initiatives  in sub-Saharan Africa that have led to significant NCI grant funding. While we retained the capability of using  Developmental Funds for bridge funding, we did not utilize any Development Funds for this in the last cycle.  As has been the case over the last decade, Developmental Funds have been key in the growth of the Center's  scientific and clinical impact. LCCC requests $50,000 increase in this category, to $700,000 per year, in this  renewal application, justified by past success and needs for a growing Center. We will continue to use these  funds in recruitment, pilot projects, and Shared Resource development and retain the potential for interim  (bridge) funding."
"9466872","Summary Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are known to be diagnostic for human health. However, the ability to effectively diagnose and classify a disease state using only patient exhaled breath is the subject of great debate. A recently published ACS Nano (Dec. 2016) multi-national clinical study on breath diagnostics by Nakhleh et al., titled ?Diagnosis and classification of 17 diseases from 1404 subjects via pattern analysis of exhaled molecules,? had the conclusion that an ?artificially intelligent nanoarray? which evaluated 1404 subjects in nine clinical settings composed of blind experiments could achieve 86% accuracy for blind experiment discrimination between diseases. This was based on the fact that each disease displayed a unique volatile molecular signature compared to healthy controls and other diseases. The results highlighted the need to continue the development of new compact VOC measurement systems that employ methods for quantification of individual components in complex mixtures of VOCs (e.g. exhaled breath). The critical barrier for development of a low-profile vapor environment monitoring device is the introduction of new solid-state transducer arrays that can quantify transient VOC doses and analyze the response profile without requiring bulky benchtop processes such as chromatography columns and associated vacuum detectors necessary for methods such as mass spectrometry. To accomplish this goal, Nanohmics Inc. proposes to develop a multiplexed VOC detetection platform based on direct electrical detection from metal oxide semiconductor arrays patterned using the method of NanoImprint Lithography (NIL) for high sensitivity signature profiling of breath-borne VOC biomarkers that will accelerate the discovery of potential new methods for disease state monitoring."
"9449016","ABSTRACT CD36, or scavenger receptor B2, is highly conserved through evolution and has metabolic and immune functions. Our findings together suggest that CD36 has five major functions in the gut: 1) FA uptake by the proximal intestine, 2) initiation of chylomicron synthesis and chylomicron input into the lymph, 3) mounting of a full immune response to enteric pathogens, 4) facilitating neutrophil clearance and 5) extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling and tissue repair [40]. Based on our recent findings we propose that low or dysfunctional gut CD36 can be a susceptibility gene for dietary fat induced gut inflammation. Our hypothesis is that abnormal ECM remodeling will induce gut inflammation and together with impaired immune cell function will lead to progression of gut inflammation to the systemic level involving multiple organs with development of whole body insulin resistance. Indeed, subclinical inflammation appears present in obese subjects carrying the minor allele of a coding SNP that reduces CD36 level by 50%. The studies we propose in aim 1 will examine CD36?s role in dietary fat induced alterations of ECM remodeling and immunity in the gut and will yield information relevant to etiology of major complications of obesity. We will also conduct immune cell profiling of subjects with CD36 deficiency. Another way by which the gut influences systemic homeostasis is through secretions of the preabsorptive phase. This phase in people is important for optimal nutrient processing and energy metabolism. However, little is known about its regulation and why it is blunted in type-2 diabetes. Our preliminary data indicate blunting of preabsorptive secretions in individuals with partial CD36 deficiency. We propose in aim 2 to study the components of the preabsorptive phase in CD36-/- mice and to determine if it is mediated by CD36 expression on vagal neurons using a new mouse generated by deletion of CD36 in preganglionic parasympathetic neurons using the Phox2b-Cre. In aim 3 we will study the role of CD36 in the stomach. Expression of CD36 in the stomach is among the highest in the mouse (data not shown) and although it was demonstrated in 2001 any role of CD36 in the stomach has not been examined. Our preliminary data indicate CD36 is highly expressed on endothelial cells (EC) and parietal cells (PC) in the stomach and CD36 deletion alters PC morphology and function. We will examine how CD36 deletion in EC or PC impacts PC metabolism and function and the impact on ECM remodeling and response to injury from high fat diet, high tamoxifen treatment or H pylori infection. Overall the studies in aims 1-3 are will increase our understanding of gut homeostatic functions, how they are altered by excess dietary fat and the associated systemic implications. The information obtained could help design novel therapeutic approaches to alleviate gut inflammation and its systemic impact."
"9391189","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    More than 400,000 sudden cardiac deaths occur in the USA annually. Among survivors of cardiac arrest (CA), brain injury is the biggest impediment to functional recovery. Induced hypothermia is currently the only form of therapy that improves both survival and neurological outcome for CA survivors. However, for decades, hypothermia delivery has been blindly directed toward faster cooling, and without objective indicators of the brain's response to temperature. So far, there is no monitoring methodology to guide hypothermia therapy and to improve its efficiency. A major hindrance for more beneficial results of this therapy is that optimal level and duration of hypothermia is unknown. The detail mechanisms underlying the protective effect of hypothermia are also largely unknown. Aim 1: Our first goal is to develop and evaluate novel, non-invasive, quantitative EEG (qEEG) marker of functional outcome after CA. We test the hypotheses that a) qEEG analysis, based on our novel entropy based algorithms, will capture electrophysiological recovery to pre-CA baseline, and b) sequential recovery in subbands will have highly differentiated entropy level, and correspondingly show greater sensitivity to different phases of recovery after injury and effects of therapeutic hypothermia. Aim 2: We will use the qEEG marker to obtain feedback on brain's response to the a) depth (temperature level) and b) duration of hypothermia delivery. We will test the hypothesis that electrophysiological monitoring by qEEG will serve as a biomarker of the brain's recovery and, thus, will provide objective guidance for hypothermia delivery. Aim 3: Our last broad goal is to provide an objective analysis of hypothermia's effect on spatio-temporal pattern of glucose utilization (via small animal positron emission tomography (PET) imaging and electrophysiological recovery (EEG)) after CA. We test the hypotheses that hypothermia will increase the glucose re-utilization and change the spatial pattern in subcortical and cortical brain regions, which contribute to corresponding EEG changes signaling recovery with an earlier return of normalization, to improve the functional outcome after CA. The significance of this project is three fold: 1) development and systematic evaluation of simple and objective qEEG monitoring tools of brain injury after CA, 2) the expected benefits of improved functional and electrophysiological outcomes with dynamic hypothermia titration, and 3) expected discovery of the protective mechanism behind therapeutic hypothermia and consequent glucose utilization and cortical electrophysiological function. The innovation in this project lies in 1) comprehensive and novel quantitative algorithm to systemically monitor and predict arousal after CA, 2) for the first time, guiding hypothermia delivery by the qEEG markers of brain's response to temperature, and 3) unique dual monitoring approach (PET and EEG) after CA to uncover hypothermia's protective mechanism. The approach to assess the improvement using glucose metabolic and electrophysiological recovery (EEG) patterns will be highly important to understand the mechanisms and develop a rational approach to hypothermia treatment. Our experimental model and the proposed technical approaches readily lend themselves to clinical translation: for example qEEG markers could easily be incorporated in a clinical bedside monitor. Like ubiquitous external defibrillator revolutionized heart protection, our novel monitoring and titration of hypothermia we hope will enter clinical practice."
"9421963","PROJECT SUMMARY AND ABSTRACT The vascular access is the lifeline for the hemodialysis patient. The most common etiology of vascular access dysfunction in hemodialysis patients is failure of an arteriovenous fistula (AVF) to mature successfully for dialysis use (AVF maturation failure). At present, there remains a very high rate of AVF maturation failure in the United States and there are no effective treatments to enhance AVF maturation. On a radiologic level, AVF maturation failure is most commonly characterized by a stenosis at the venous anastomosis, and at a histological level it is characterized by a combination of aggressive neointimal hyperplasia and poor outward remodeling. The poor outcomes following AVF creation reflect our limited understanding of the mechanisms leading to AVF maturation failure; and the lack of therapies to treat this clinical problem represent an unmet clinical need. The objective of this proposal is to understand the role of the endothelial nitric oxide synthase (NOS3)/nitric oxide (NO) system in AVF development. Preliminary work from our rodent AVF models has demonstrated: (1) impaired endothelial-dependent vasorelaxation (decreased NOS3-derived NO bioavailability) at the AVF anastomosis, (2) poor hemodynamic adaptation and biological responses in the setting of NOS3 dysfunction, (3) increased AVF neointimal hyperplasia and matrix metalloproteinase production in the setting of chronic kidney disease, and (4) reduced neointimal hyperplasia and improved vascular biological responses to a NO-releasing bionanomatrix gel applied directly at the AVF anastomosis during AVF creation. Based on these preliminary studies, the central hypothesis of this proposal is that the NOS3/NO system plays a critical role in successful AVF maturation by regulating local vascular hemodynamic adaptation and vascular biological responses after AVF creation; and locally delivered NO therapies applied at the AVF anastomosis can improve these two processes. Using our murine and rat AVF models, we will test our central hypothesis with two specific aims: (1) To determine how the NOS3 system modulates hemodynamic adaptation and biological responses during AVF maturation and (2) To evaluate the effect of a nitric oxide- releasing nanomatrix gel administered locally at the AVF anastomosis during AVF creation on enhancing AVF development. We believe our proposed research is significant because: (1) it addresses a very important clinical problem in hemodialysis patients, AVF maturation failure, where there are presently no effective therapies and (2) examines a fundamentally important system in AVF development, the NOS3/NO system. Successful completion of these aims will identify important targets for developing innovative therapies that aim to modify the NOS3/NO system in order to enhance AVF maturation. Our results will also have broad implications for other vascular conditions such as peripheral arterial disease, coronary artery disease, and postangioplasty restenosis."

"9453235","Project Summary/Abstract  The current proposal requests support for a mentored career development award for Dr. Matthew Karafin, a junior faculty member in transfusion medicine. Dr. Karafin's long-term goal is to be an independently-funded clinical scientist in transfusion medicine with a focus on sickle cell disease (SCD). In this proposal, a structured career development plan, which includes focused didactic and laboratory experiences, complements three aims to address a critical question: whether older red cell units are harmful to an adult with SCD.  Little is known about how the biochemical changes associated with prolonged red cell storage (the ?storage lesion?) impact patients with SCD.1 While randomized trials in other patient populations have not associated older units with adverse clinical outcomes,2-6 adults with SCD have a unique pathophysiology and may be susceptible to an older unit's altered biology. Murine models suggest that a bolus of older stored red cells, which have increased levels of surface phosphotidlyethanolamine (PE), phosphatidylserine (PS), and increased concentrations of microparticles,7-10 overwhelms macrophages and results in marked increases in inflammation and non-transferrin bound iron (NTBI), which facilitates increased virulence of microbial pathogens and fatal sepsis.11-13 To address this knowledge gap, we have conducted a series of preliminary studies in adults with SCD that demonstrated: 1) there is equipoise among blood bank directors about the effects of older units in adults with SCD,14 2) greater than 25% of adults with SCD at our own institution are predominantly transfused with older red cell units (?33 days),15,16 3) red cell surface exposure of PE and PS, and microparticle concentration, increases 20-fold, 6-fold and 4-fold from 7 to 35 days of storage, respectively,10 4) transfusion of red cell units stored ?14 days is associated with significant CD62L+ activation of macrophages in adults with SCD, and 5) in adults with SCD, receipt of older units is associated with an increased risk for infection that requires a hospital admission.15 Since storage changes, such as PS exposure, promote phagocytosis of red cells by macrophages,17-19 we hypothesize that older red cell units trigger phagocytosis and activation of circulating macrophages with a downstream immunomodulatory cascade and release of excess NTBI that leads to increased rates of infection in adults with SCD.  To test this hypothesis, we will perform a randomized prospective clinical trial. In aim 1, we will determine the biochemical differences between ?30 day-old versus ?10 day-old units. In aim 2, we will determine the physiologic effects of the transfused blood in a patient with SCD. Lastly, in aim 3, we will explore the clinical implications of receiving older red cells over a 3 month period."
"9389526","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Microvascular disease associated with hypertension and peripheral vascular disease is becoming increasingly common in the aging population of the Western world. Remodeling and loss of micro vessels (MV) distal to renal arterial obstruction leads to irreversible injury, which is magnified by coexistence of the metabolic syndrome (MetS). However, no effective clinically applicable strategies are currently available that are capable of improving MV structure and function and restoring renal viability. Low-energy shock wave therapy (SWT) is a novel non-invasive experimental strategy, which elicits biological responses in the cardiovascular system, including stimulation of endogenous reparative capacity and formation of new MV. In rodent models SWT can enhance recruitment of endothelial progenitor cells (EPC) to sites of hind-limb ischemia. Yet, the potential of this novel therapeutic platform t improve MV viability in renovascular diseased (RVD) associated with MetS has not been investigated. We have developed and characterized novel swine models of RVD and MetS that allow translational studies highly relevant to clinical medicine, as well as unique imaging techniques ideally suited for probing MV injury and viability. We have also shown the efficacy of using autologous EPC delivered into a stenotic renal artery to improve distal function. These tools now afford an opportunity to test the ability of SWT to enhance renal MV function and structure in RVD and promote recruitment of EPC to improve MV regeneration. The working hypothesis underlying this proposal is that SWT in RVD/MetS decreases injury, improves MV viability, and promotes recruitment of circulating EPC in the post-stenotic kidney. To test this hypothesis, we will study the effects of SWT using cutting-edge multi-detector CT (MDCT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and micro-CT tools. Furthermore, the ability of SWT to improve renal recovery prospects will be tested in PVD pigs undergoing revascularization and stenting. Three specific aims will be pursued: Specific Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that SWT activates mechano- transduction signaling and improves renal MV density and function in RVD associated with MetS. Specific Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that this tactic would boost kidney MV viability after revascularization of RVD/MetS. Specific Aim 3 will test the hypothesis that SWT promotes recruitment and local retention of endogenous and exogenous EPC, respectively, in the post-stenotic kidney. Noninvasive improvement of the MV network using SWT is a promising, cutting edge technique, which will likely contribute significantly towards management of MV disease. The proposed studies may have broad ramifications and establish this novel, clinically feasible therapeutic strategy for RVD, MetS, and hypertension."
"9463031","ABSTRACT  Although the mechanism of Cd(II)-induced carcinogenesis remains to be investigated, recent studies have indicated that autophagy plays a significant role. Our preliminary studies have shown that exposure of human lung bronchial epithelial BEAS-2B cells to Cd(II) generates reactive oxygen species (ROS), which are responsible for Cd(II)-induced malignant cell transformation. We have also shown that Cd(II) is able to induce autophagy in normal BEAS-2B cells. The activation of autophagy by Cd(II) is likely to be a cell self- defense mechanism against Cd(II)-induced oxidative damage. Our preliminary studies have also shown that Cd(II)-transformed BEAS-2B cells exhibit autophagy deficiency (autophagy incompetence), resulting in accumulation of autophagosomes and increased level of p62 protein. The increased p62 causes a constitutive activation of Nrf2, which in turn upregulates its target antioxidant proteins, superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) and superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2), and anti-apoptotic proteins, Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL, most likely due to increased binding of Nrf2 to antioxidant response element (ARE) sites of these target proteins. The upregulations of these antioxidants (decrease ROS) and anti-apoptotic proteins result in development of apoptosis resistance of Cd(II)-transformed cells. The constitutively elevated p62 and Nrf2 are responsible for survival advantage of Cd(II)-transformed cells. Natural compound sulforaphane increased autophagy in normal cells exposed to Cd(II) and restored autophagy competence in Cd(II)-transformed cells. The central hypothesis of this application is that autophagy is a cell defense mechanism in Cd(II)-induced malignant cell transformation and that autophagy deficiency is responsible for tumorigenesis of Cd(II)-transformed cells. Aim 1 will investigate the protective role of autophagy against Cd(II)-induced malignant cell transformation. The hypothesis of this aim is that autophagy protects against Cd(II)-induced malignant cell transformation by decreasing ROS through facilitating mitochondrial turnover in normal cells and that sulforaphane enhances autophagy and decreases the cell transformation. Aim 2 will demonstrate that autophagy deficiency in Cd(II)- transformed cells increases cell survival through constitutive activation of p62/Nrf2 signaling. The hypothesis of this aim is that Cd(II)-transformed cells are autophagy deficient, resulting in accumulation of autophagosomes, constitutive activations of p62/Nrf2, elevated levels of antioxidants, Bcl-2, and Bcl-xL, decreased levels of ROS, and acquisition of apoptosis resistance. Aim 3 will investigate roles of autophagy deficiency, elevation of p62, constitutive activation of Nrf2, and apoptosis resistance in tumorigenesis of Cd(II)-transformed cells and protection by sulforaphane in vivo. The hypothesis of this aim is that autophagy deficiency in Cd(II)-transformed cells promotes tumorigenesis through elevation of p62, constitutive activation of Nrf2, and acquisition of apoptosis resistance and that sulforaphane restores autophagy competence and inhibits tumorigenesis."
"9393534","Project Summary: Overall Indiana Alcohol Research Center (IARC)  The Indiana Alcohol Research Center (IARC) has devoted three decades to understanding how genetic factors and responses to alcohol contribute to the risk of developing an alcohol use disorder (AUD). We continue these efforts by now examining why certain immoderate drinkers transition into a stage in which they become insensitive to the aversive outcomes associated with heavy drinking. The IARC will therefore address the critical need to understand the genetic, behavioral, and neurobiological paths by which ?aversion-resistant drinking? develops. The rationale for our centered approach is that working in close association across several scientific disciplines and spheres of expertise permits our investigators to achieve insights that are not possible when working in isolation. The IARC's central hypothesis is that aversion-resistant drinking arises through a combination of inherited behavioral and neurobiological vulnerabilities, as well as progressive changes in fronto-striatal neurotransmission in response to drinking history.  The objective of this next IARC cycle is to therefore apply coordinated, multi-disciplinary efforts to understand the brain and behavioral mechanisms through which aversion-resistant drinking arises. Using the IARC's selected animal lines, our specific aims are to determine how aversion resistant drinking may arise through: (1) Changes in medial prefrontal glutamate systems, (2) unique impulsive endophenotypic behaviors and associated differential functioning in medial prefrontal cortex, (3) forms of cognitive inflexibility and alterations in glutamate receptors in the brain's dorsal striatum, and (4) drinking history and genetic influences on the corticostriatal encoding of alcohol-paired cues. Accompanying these preclinical animal studies will be (5) a novel translational paradigm in humans to determine how aversion-resistant alcohol seeking behaviors relate to drinking history, alcohol use disorder symptoms, and brain physiology. The IARC will also (6) provide a pilot mechanism to develop new investigators and research directions, and support promising directions related to the IARC's research components. Finally, the IARC will expand existing educational, implementation, and outreach for primary care providers and the legal profession. The IARC will thus function in a coordinated way to integrate human and animal research on how genetic risk, alcohol exposure, and endophenotypic behaviors contribute to the important problem of compulsive drinking.   "
"9397715","Alzheimer?s disease (AD) is the most prevalent neurodegenerative disease of aging, with one in eight older Americans diagnosed with AD. It is also the most frequently diagnosed type of dementia within the Veterans Affairs (VA) Medical System, and one of the major causes of morbidity and mortality among veterans. The Department of VA estimates that 600,000 veterans suffered from severe AD and other forms of dementia in 2000, and this number is increased significantly today, because of the increasing proportion of older veterans and the increased prevalence of dementia in veterans that suffer from traumatic brain injury (TBI) and/or post- traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Therefore, AD research studies are particularly important to veterans. Currently no treatment is available to slow or stop AD. There is a great need for identification of more efficacious therapies for AD, which is among the priorities of VA RR&D research directions.  Synaptojanin 1 (synj1), the main phosphoinositol biphosphate phosphatase [PIP2 degrading enzyme] in the brain and synapses, has been recently linked to AD. More importantly, we have demonstrated that synj1 regulates lysosomal clearance of A? and that the increased synj1 expression links to ApoE4-induced phospholipid dysregulation and cognitive deficits. Down-regulation of synj1 promotes A? clearance, reduces tau hyper-phosphorylation and ameliorates ApoE4 pathogenic effects. Subsequently, reduction of synj1 attenuates AD-related pathological changes and behavioral deficits in AD mouse models. These findings suggest that reduction of synj1 has potential therapeutic benefits for AD. Our initial screening of 89 top hits out of a library of compounds (~3,600 small molecules) with the potential to reduce synj1 protein levels using ?The Connectivity Map?, identified a FDA-approved drug nimodpine with synj1- and A?-lowering effects in both wild- type and ApoE4 neuronal cultures. Further administration of nimodipine for one month, is capable of reducing brain content of synj1 and A?, as well as improving cognitive functions in an AD transgenic mouse model and an ApoE4 KI mouse model. However, chronic administration of nimodipine failed to reduce brain A?42 levels (particularly insoluble fractions), or to improve cognitive function. Our data suggest that the effects of nimodipine on reduction of synj1 expression are independent of its inhibitory effects on calcium channel activities. We then designed and synthesized first-generation nimodipine structural analogs using medicinal chemistry to reduce its calcium channel activity, and identified a novel compound, SynaptoCpd#9, with attenuated inhibition of calcium channels and increased potency against synj1 and A?42 compared to nimodipine both in vitro and in vivo. Oral administration of SynaptoCpd#9 in APPSwe/PS1?E9 and ApoE4 mice for 3-6 months improved cognitive function and reduced AD-related pathologies (insoluble A?42 particularly). RNA-sequencing and qPCR studies of treated ApoE4 neurons identified three candidate genes involved in nimodipine- or SynaptoCpd#9-mediated effects. We posit that continued exploration of SAR of nimodipine derivatives and further dissection of their mechanisms of actions will provide new insights regarding AD pathogenesis and may lead to identification of novel targets for AD therapies.  In this application, we propose to refine structural modifications of nimodipine derivatives to increase their potency at lowering synj1 and improving cognitive function in AD mouse models (aim 1: medicinal chemistry modifications, in vitro test funnel assays and in vivo proof of concept animal studies). In parallel studies, we propose to dissect mechanisms of actions of these novel compounds (aim 2: mechanistic studies), which will provide new insights regarding mechanisms of AD pathogenesis and advance therapeutic strategies for AD. Information obtained from our proposed studies will lead to development of novel potent AD therapies, and better understanding of AD pathogenesis through mechanistic investigation. Therefore, our studies will directly benefit Veterans, and improve the quality of service provided within the VA health care system."

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is a competitive renewal of NIH T32 HL-07910 entitled: Basic Science Studies on Gene Therapy of Blood Diseases which is currently in its 15th year of funding. The discipline of gene therapy has had its ups and downs, but to continue to advance the field, we must train the next generation of investigators in this area. The aim of this program is to continue to train this next generation of scientists in the clinically-relevant medical area of gene transfer for effective modulation of normal and abnormal cell growth and for gene therapy to correct blood diseases. We request 4 pre- and 5 post-doctoral slots, an increase of 1 pre-doc slot. We have an outstanding group of 23 very productive, interactive, and well-respected investigators as mentors with their primary and/or secondary faculty appointments in 8 departments of the medical school. These mentors have over their career trained a total of 169 pre-doctoral PhD and 284 post-doctoral students. Since the competitive renewal of this program in 2009, we were able to train and/or are in the process of training 11 pre- and 13 post-doctoral students, who have published 112 papers [37 (Pre-Doc) and 75 (Post-Doc)]. The Program Director (PD) has trained 17 pre-doctoral and 55 post- doctoral/clinical fellows, has published over 720 papers and been continuously funded by the NIH since 1978. He is a recognized authority on hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells, the regulation of hematopoiesis, and has had his work translated into clinical utility. The Co-PD, is also a well-recognized and well-funded productive investigator who has trained numerous students and fellows, and has had his work translated for clinical benefit. The PD and Co-PD have extensive administrative experience and have worked for many years in the area of gene transfer in efforts to enhance approaches to gene therapy. The vast majority of our trainees, since initial funding of this grant in 1999, have gone on to careers in academia and other research intensive areas of employment. Training of our pre- and post-doctoral students entails one-on-one interactions, committee and group mentorship, lab meetings, special seminars in the area of this training program, didactic courses, ethical training, presentations at scientific meetings and high expectations for the trainees to publish in respected scientific and medical journals, and to continue in their career development leading them to become productive independent investigators whose work will benefit healthcare in general and gene transfer/gene therapy in specific.

"9405325","PROJECT SUMMARY Spatial and temporal control of gene expression is crucial for the development of multicellular organisms. Improper gene expression leads to many abnormalities including developmental disorders and cancer. In addition to genetic information and chromatin structure, the three dimensional spatial organization of the eukaryotic genome within the nucleus significantly contributes to genome function. Critical to this organization is a developmentally essential architectural protein, CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF). CTCF exerts its insulator function by forming looping interactions between nonadjacent segments of DNA. CTCF binds to a highly conserved motif on DNA that is enriched at the borders of topologically associating domains (TADs), which are the building blocks of genome organization. Currently, we know neither how CTCF functions as a barrier between distinct chromatin domains, nor how it forms loops between distant loci. CTCF binding and function at many loci can be regulated in several ways; possibly through methylation of DNA, posttranslational modifications of CTCF, interactions with other proteins (i.e. cohesin), interactions with RNA, and multimerization of CTCF. Although CTCF constitutively binds to numerous loci across cell types, it can exert distinct functions depending on the cellular context. These variations cannot be explained by CTCF binding alone. CTCF can bind to the same regions in different cell types although it acts as a barrier in one cell type but not in the other. In our model system, a CTCF binding event within the HoxA cluster has no affect on transcription in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs), while it functions as a chromatin insulator upon differentiation into motor neurons (MNs). This suggests that CTCF binding is necessary, but not sufficient to mediate its insulation function. Rather, downstream regulatory events must be required to achieve specificity. These events could include modification to CTCF or association with secondary proteins, among other possibilities. Therefore, we hypothesize that CTCF interacts with other factors to function as an insulator. Here, we describe genetic and biochemical screens to identify factors that affect the ability of CTCF to perform its insulator function. Both approaches can independently reveal crucial factors for insulation function, which will be further analyzed to explain their mechanism of action. Ultimately, the proposed project will have an impact on gene regulation, with the results being fundamentally important for developmental and diseased processes such as developmental defects (i.e. human limb malformations), neurological disorders, and cancer."
"9430961","PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT This K23 application for Dr. Jiwon Kim will enable her to develop as an independent clinical investigator focused on the use of novel imaging strategies to improve risk stratification among patients with heart failure and coronary artery disease (CAD). A K23 award will allow Dr. Kim to attain expertise in 3 areas: (1) new cardiac MRI (CMR) approaches for improved tissue characterization of the right ventricle (RV), (2) advanced echocardiography techniques to be applied for the RV in population based studies, (3) principles of clinical investigation needed to initiate independent design and execution of sophisticated research protocols. To pursue these goals, Dr. Kim has assembled a multidisciplinary mentoring team. Her primary mentor, Dr. Weinsaft, is the principal investigator of the R01 to which this K23 is paired and has extensive research experience in CMR assessment of myocardial tissue properties. Dr. Wang is a co-mentor with an established track record in high-resolution CMR pulse sequence development. Dr. Devereux is a secondary co-mentor with expertise in cardiac ultrasound and epidemiology. The goal of Dr. Kim's K23 research is to identify myocardial tissue-based markers of RV dysfunction among CAD patients. RV dysfunction occurs in up to 40% of patients with CAD and has been shown to independently increase risk of death. Altered myocardial tissue properties is a potential causative substrate for RV dysfunction but has not yet been studied in this context due to limited ability to visualize infarction in the thin RV wall. New high-resolution techniques (3D navigator CMR) including those that have the possibility to be tailored for the RV (RV epicardial fat navigator) may improve RV tissue characterization. To test these concepts, 150 patients with CAD undergoing stress CMR pre- and post- revascularization will be studied. Stress CMR will be used to determine relationships between left and right ventricular tissue properties (ischemia and infarction) and RV function (Aim 1). To optimize RV myocardial infarction (RV-MI) detection, the RV will be assessed using standard 2D CMR and new 3D CMR technologies (RV epicardial fat navigator) (Aim 2). To test the concept that revascularization may improve RV function, RV-MI will be studied as a marker for irreversible RV dysfunction: RV-MI will be used to predict RV functional improvement following coronary revascularization (Aim 3A). Lastly, to study the impact of RV-MI on functional consequences, RV-MI will be studied in relation to effort tolerance on cardiopulmonary exercise testing (Aim 3B). This training and research plan will leverage existing multidisciplinary collaborations and institutional resources including Dr. Weinsaft's R01 from which imaging data will be drawn and the Cornell Clinical Translational Science Center through which a Master's degree will be obtained in Clinical Investigation. Finally, this research will inform future R01 applications, which will test new high resolution approaches for RV coronary perfusion and study RV functional response to coronary revascularization in viable but ischemic RV."
"9393322","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Support is requested to continue a productive collaboration aimed to develop, test, and extend computational models of eye movement control in visual decision making and visual search. Our research program is guided by converging constraints from computational, behavioral, and neurophysiological perspectives that link detailed patterns of behavior in humans and monkeys performing visual saccade tasks with patterns of modulation in neurons recorded in monkeys through the use of computational models that predict behavioral and neural dynamics. We propose new computational modeling of existing monkey behavioral and neurophysiological experiments and new computational modeling of new human experiments that mirror and significantly extend experiments previously conducted with monkeys. Our theoretical foundation is a class of stochastic accumulation of evidence models that mathematical psychologists and systems neuroscientists have converged upon as a general theoretical framework to understand and explain the time course of visual decision making; these include an interactive race model and a gated accumulator model we proposed previously. Unlike most approaches, (1) we quantitatively test alternative model architectures (including race, diffusion, competitive, gated accumulators) on detailed behavioral data in both humans and monkeys, including response probabilities and distributions of correct and error response times for saccades, (2) we constrain model mechanisms and model parameters based on neurophysiological recordings, specifically neurons in frontal eye field (FEF) hypothesized to represent the evolving time-course of task-relevant visual evidence, (3) we quantitatively test model architectures on how well they predict the recorded dynamics of neurons involved in make a visual decision, specifically neurons in FEF that determine when and where the eyes move. Aim 1 will develop and test the gated accumulator model against alternative models of countermanding and control of saccadic eye movements. Aim 2 will develop and test the gated accumulator model against alternative models of speed-accuracy control of saccadic eye movements in visual search. Aim 3 will investigate how to scale the broad class of stochastic accumulator models, including gated accumulator, from a single accumulator associated with each response to ensembles of thousands of accumulator neurons associated with each response. To understand normal behavior as well as illness, disability, and disease, abstract computational models, like stochastic accumulation of evidence models, can be a just right theoretical level in that best-fitting parameters of these models can characterize well individual differences in behavior and provide theoretical markers for understanding brain measures - our models provide that just right theoretical level. Yet to the extent that certain neurological conditions have a biophysical basis at the level of individual neurons and neural circuits, we also need to understand how these abstract computational models map onto neural circuits - making this mapping is also core to our proposed work."

"9407708","ABSTRACT  Gene expression, which encompasses a series of reactions from initial gene activation to final protein folding, is an inherently noisy process for any cell population under study. As each step in the process is subject to independent regulatory pressures, small between cell differences in the levels of these regulators can produce substantial transcriptional heterogeneity, which may then propagate into substantial functional diversity. It is therefore challenging to understand how complex multi-cellular tissues faithfully develop given the number of genes that must be coordinately expressed to establish cellular identity. Master regulatory transcription factors (TF) are the proposed solution to this teleological dilemma. These molecules have been shown to control cohorts of genes required for normal cell function, and achieving the appropriate level and stoichiometry between different TF appears to be critical for fate decisions during normal tissue development. Moreover, the deregulation in either the expression or function of these factors appears to play a substantial role in malignant transformation. TF have been extensively studied in hematopoiesis, the highly arborized differentiation network that robustly and dynamically produces a spectrum of functionally distinct blood cell populations responsible for hemostasis, gas exchange, and immune function. In order to achieve this complex cellular output, hematopoietic differentiation is postulated to occur as a series of nodal fate decisions in increasingly oligopotent stem and progenitor cell compartments (HSPC), each with distinct gene expression programs governed by TF. Understanding how HSPC achieve the appropriate dose and activity of these TF is therefore vital to our understanding of steady state blood differentiation and may expose novel therapeutic windows in hematological disease. Complicating these efforts, however, is the finding that HSPC are functionally and transcriptionally heterogeneous, which have limited the field's ability to uncover definitive regulation of TF based on ensemble measurements. This project is intended to quantify the origins of that heterogeneity with single molecule, quantitative techniques to uncover the regulation and expression of a master hematopoietic TF, PU.1. Our proposal is to (1) determine how PU.1 mRNA and protein production is dynamically changed during differentiation in single primary HSPC from mice by RNA FISH/IF and to (2) independently measure how a highly conserved cis regulatory element (URE) controls the rate, magnitude, and dynamics of PU.1 transcription. Our preliminary findings have indicated that not only is our experimental approach feasible, it has already revealed intriguing findings about PU.1 mRNA synthesis that were previously unknown. Using these tools and sophisticated analytical techniques, this proposal will provide the highest resolution, quantitative study to date of the regulation and activity of a master regulatory transcription factor in primary HSPC. We anticipate that our approach will provide novel and fundamental insight into the molecular paradigms regulating hematopoiesis and leukemogenesis.  "
"9417730","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Ticks transmit many pathogenic viruses and bacteria and in the United States are responsible for more human disease than any other arthropod group. Alarmingly, the severity and incidence of disease transmission has been steadily increasing. For instance Lyme disease (LD) caused by Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato genospecies, first identified in the 1970s in a small number of cases in Connecticut, is now the most commonly reported arthropod-borne disease in the US. Early detection leading to antibiotic treatment is usually curative, but if left undiagnosed, LD frequently develops into disseminated disease that can affect neurologic, cardiac and muscoskeletal systems. Unfortunately, early diagnosis is often confounded by non-specific symptoms and lack of risk awareness. Since increased infected tick density is correlates well with human disease incidence, B. burgdorferi surveillance can help estimate disease endemicity and risk of spread, which in turn can be used to raise awareness, heighten prevention and engender aggressive monitoring of early clinical signs and molecular markers of LD. However, current molecular surveillance techniques, mostly based on polymerase chain reaction (PCR), require technical expertise, complex instruments, and extensive infrastructure typically only available in centralized laboratories. Innovative molecular diagnostic tools are critically needed to improve vector surveillance across states in geographically remote or resource-limited areas.  To fill this critical need, we propose to develop a low cost point-of-care (POC) nucleic acid diagnostic that will identify Ixodes scapularis and B. burgdorferi sensu stricto, the principal vector and pathogen, respectively, responsible for LD. Our one-pot assay designed for field-use will generate clear `Yes/No' answers with minimal user intervention or data analysis. Our POC surveillance platform will rely on several molecular innovations: adapting a chemically-modified, high amplification efficiency version of loop-mediated isothermal amplification, coupling isothermal amplification with nucleic acid logic processing to improve diagnostic surety, developing wavelength-shifting TAO probes to color code specific amplicons, optimizing assays and probes to generate fluorescence amplitude that can be readily imaged with smartphones, and proofing diagnostic performance with field-caught ticks supplied by our partner, Dr. Maria Esteve-Gassent at Texas A&M University.  R21 funding will propel our research to the point where we can apply for Early Translational Research Awards and begin to partner for larger scale manufacturing and field trials. Moreover, development of this simple-but-robust approach to fast and accurate pathogen detection can be readily diversified for surveillance of a wider array of vectors and pathogens. We envision that by reducing cost and increasing end user accessibility, our POC diagnostic platform will facilitate greater geographic and demographic penetration of surveillance while enabling rapid reporting of epidemiological data via cloud networks."
"9433994","PROJECT SUMMARY  The Asian tiger mosquito Aedes albopictus is the world?s most successful invasive mosquito species that in the last four decades has invaded all continents except Antarctica. Ae. albopictus is a competent vector of various arboviral illnesses including dengue fever?the leading arboviral disease of the 21st century?and Zika fever?the disease that caused an epidemic outbreak in Brazil in 2015 with 1.5 million cases of the disease and more than 5 thousand cases of uncommon microcephaly in newborns. As a competent vector of Zika virus, Ae. albopictus has the potential to spread this dangerous disease further north because of its remarkable ability to develop a photoperiodic diapause in the temperate climate. This project will develop a chromosome- based reference genome assembly for Ae. albopictus and will test if adaptations to the temperate climate are associated with structural variations in the Ae. albopictus genome. Toward this end, we propose the following specific aims: 1) develop a high-quality genome assembly for a North American strain of Ae. albopictus using PacBio sequencing, 2) construct a physical map for the Ae. albopictus genome based on fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) on mitotic chromosomes, and 3) determine structural genome variation in temperature and tropical strains of Ae. albopictus using 10X Genomics sequencing and FISH. Our long-term goal is to understand the genetic basis of the incredible phenotypic plasticity of Ae. albopictus that helps this mosquito to rapidly spread around the globe. We envision that the availability of the high-quality reference genome assembly for the North American strain of Ae. albopictus will stimulate further genetic studies aimed at preventing mosquito-borne disease transmission."
"9393537","Project Summary: Animal Production Core Alcohol and other substance abuse continue to be enormous public health issues with total costs in the US approaching a half billion dollars a year. Although there are major attempts at prevention, a better understanding of the genetic and environmental factors that increase the risk of alcohol use disorders, the neural circuits that underlie this risk, and the ability to regulate these circuits therapeutically are all still critically needed. In addressing this critical need, this Animal Production Core will continue to provide the P/NP and HAD/LAD rats, as well as the HAP/LAP and cHAP mice that have been selectively bred for a high vs low alcohol preference, to investigators in the Indiana Alcohol Research Center (IARC) or on the Indiana University?Purdue University at Indianapolis (IUPUI) campus. This Core is the outgrowth of over 30 years of experience with selective breeding, maintenance of breeding colonies, and solving problems arising with the logistics and nature of running an operation of this magnitude. We are therefore uniquely qualified in the coming funding period to continue to provide these animals to alcoholism and addiction researchers, to coordinate the use of the animals to avoid scientific overlap, and to manage issues that could affect their phenotype and associated behaviors. Addiction has become a disease of co-abuse, with the majority of individuals dependent on alcohol often being dependent on other licit or illicit substances as well. Given this, there are likely common environmental and genetic factors that result in a broad predisposition to the abuse of many substances, as well as alcohol specifically. The Animal Production Core will continue to characterize these lines (high vs low preference) as animal models of addiction, and promote their use in examining the genetic and neurobiological substrates of substance use, abuse and dependence.  "

"9468119","Project Summary  Hsp104 is a hexameric AAA+ protein disaggregase from yeast that can rapidly disassemble disordered aggregates, preamyloid oligomers, amyloids, and prions. These activities have allowed yeast to harness beneficial prions for adaptive purposes. However, humans and metazoan lack a direct Hsp104 homologue, and are vulnerable to protein misfolding, which underpins several fatal neurodegenerative diseases including Parkinson's disease (PD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). We previously engineered potentiated Hsp104 variants that antagonize misfolding of several proteins associated with neurodegenerative disease (TDP-43 implicated in ALS and ?Syn implicated in PD). However, these variants lack substrate specificity and can be toxic in some circumstances. Thus, understanding how Hsp104 selects substrates remains an important objective. Hsp104 homologues are found in all nonmetazoan eukaryotes and eubacteria. However, the vast majority of these homologues remain unexplored. I have established that Hsp104 homologues from diverse lineages, including protozoa, fungi, and plants, are selective modifiers of TDP-43 and ?Syn proteotoxic misfolding. Based on my preliminary findings, I hypothesize that differences in substrate recognition and binding among Hsp104 homologues underpins their substrate selectivity. To test this hypothesis, I will leverage molecular evolution algorithms to identify sequence motifs that modulate Hsp104 substrate-selectivity. I will use pure protein biochemistry to evaluate the ability of substrate-selective Hsp104 orthologues and engineered variants to disaggregate protein aggregates in vitro, and to gain direct mechanistic insight into and define parameters of Hsp104 substrate selection. Finally, I will evaluate the therapeutic potential of the selective Hsp014s I identify and engineer by (1) introducing the ?Syn-selective Hsp104s into a C. elegans model of Parkinson's disease and monitoring protection of dopaminergic neurons in the worm and (2) introducing TDP-43-selective Hsp104s into a D. melanogaster model of TDP-43-opathy and monitoring the lifespan and motor neuron function of lies. These studies constitute an important step toward evolving enhanced disaggregases to combat protein misfolding in neurodegenerative disease."
"9452529","Project Summary/Abstract Evidence demonstrates that sleep deprivation causes impaired cognitive function and is associated with impaired health (e.g. altered immune and cardiovascular function). Yet these conclusions largely derive from correlational relationships or studies of acute sleep deprivation lasting only a few days in sleep labs. Further, research on sleep in disadvantaged populations and sleep disparities is limited, despite severe environmental challenges to sleep among the poor. Moreover, the potentially bi-directional relationship between poor sleep and poor decision-making, a possible mediator of the income-health gradient, remains largely unexplored. In short, while poor sleep could be an important contributor to health disparities and accelerated aging, we know relatively little about the causes and impacts of sleep deprivation in low SES populations and how to address these disparities, a gap that is especially acute in ?real-world? settings with extended time frames. This K01 application will provide key training for career advancement and begin to close this gap in knowledge. To accomplish this goal, a randomized field experiment with 400 participants, each enrolled for over one month, in Chennai, India, will (1) objectively measure sleep and key environmental factors to provide preliminary evidence on the role of environmental causes of sleep deprivation in an urban environment, (2) rigorously evaluate two simple scalable interventions to reduce sleep deprivation among low-income adults in their natural environments, (3) estimate the causal effect of improved sleep on cognitive function, decision- making, health outcomes and behaviors (e.g. blood pressure, alcohol consumption), and earnings, and (4) utilizing questions regarding sleep asked of both RCT participants and a 50,000 person nationally-representative sample, estimate the extent of sleep deprivation and its impacts more broadly in urban India. The training aims underpinning the research aims and the applicant's long-term research goals are to expand knowledge and skills in: (1) cognitive psychology and the measurement of cognitive function, (2) aging, and (3) machine learning and predictive modeling. This training, accomplished through multiple avenues including coursework, directed study, and mentorship, will directly facilitate the proposed research and extend the scope and impact of the applicant's long-term research career studying health disparities and interactions between health and decision-making which may impact both cognitive and physical health as individuals age. Notably, while this application focuses on the impacts of sleep deprivation, the potential for health to shape decision-making is much broader. Constant exposure to other aspects of poor health associated with poverty, such as pain, also have the potential to exert a mental tax, leading to impaired cognition and poor decisions. Such a negative feedback loop between these factors and decision-making has the potential to further exacerbate health disparities. The far-reaching applicability of this idea beyond the direct scope of this proposal opens the door to high public-health significance through a wide variety of channels."
"9447654","Project summary: Consolidating transient sensory experiences into long-lasting memories is a fundamental function of the brain, linked to synaptic plasticity. The importance of sleep for promoting this process, and the disruptive effect of sleep deprivation on it, have been appreciated for nearly a century. However, it remains unclear how sleep-associated changes in the activity of specific brain circuits contribute to sensory plasticity. Using a combination of longitudinal recordings of neuronal activity in freely-behaving mice, recently-developed optogenetic strategies, novel computational tools for characterizing network activity patterns, we will test the necessity and sufficiency of sleep-associated patterns of thalamocortical activity in consolidating a simple form of experience dependent plasticity. We will test the hypothesis that coherent firing during network oscillations unique NREM sleep plays a causal role in promoting plasticity between the thalamic lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) and the primary visual cortex (V1) following presentation of a novel visual stimulus. Here we will selectively manipulate cortical, thalamocortical and corticothalamic neuronal populations in a state specific manner. We will measure both response changes in individual V1 and LGN neurons to the presented stimulus, and behavioral responses to the presented stimulus in the context of a visual discrimination task. We will test whether neurons that are selectively responsive to the visual stimulus play a critical role in guiding network activity patterns during subsequent sleep, acting as an instructive mechanism for circuit plasticity. Finally, we will test whether following visual experience, sleep-dependent communication between V1 and the perirhinal cortex (essential for visual recognition memory) is responsible sleep-dependent discrimination learning."

Despite recent developments in preclinical irradiators for providing IGRT and more accurate dose calculations, a critically important component in modern radiotherapy, IMRT, is still missing. Without IMRT, the animal studies are unable to represent the dosimetric quality of state of the art human treatments, particularly with current trend of employing more complex, concave or simultaneously boosted dose distributions. As a result, successful translation from animal studies and human trial is rare. Previous efforts to develop IMRT and better mimic state of the art human radiotherapy have been unsuccessful due to the difficulty of miniaturizing multileaf collimator (MLC) and providing a planning system that is intuitive to use by biologists. To overcome these challenges, we will develop a global convex optimizer for beam orientation selection and rectangular aperture optimization so high quality IMRT treatment plans can be automatically and efficiently created using only rectangular apertures. We then propose a novel small animal IMRT dose modulator enabled by a breakthrough in plan optimization to efficiently deliver uncompromised IMRT plans with higher achievable resolution than a theoretically miniaturized MLC. We will make the hardware design and software open source to the research community. To achieve the goal, we propose the following aims: Aim 1. Develop a preclinical treatment planning system that automatically selects beam orientations and optimizes intensity modulation using multiple rectangular apertures. Aim 2. Design, fabricate and validate a sparse orthogonal collimator (SOC) to deliver the optimized rectangular segments."
"9393540","Project Summary: Behavioral Endophenotypes for Differential Ethanol-Seeking and Drinking (BESD) A body of findings from the I-ARC converges in suggesting that the selected lines of alcohol preferring rodents represent different genetic and behavioral models of alcoholism risk. While both the P and HAD2 rats are high drinkers, only P rats show poor impulse control and extreme ethanol (EtOH)-seeking behaviors (Beckwith & Czachowski, 2014; 2016). New preliminary data further show that EtOH naïve P rats also differ from HAD2 rats in their rapid habit formation for a non-EtOH reinforcer (persistent seeking of a novel flavored solution, even after its devaluation). Conceptually, habit formation indicates a general decreased attention to the outcomes of behavior while drinking despite adverse consequences (aversion-resistant drinking; ARD) indicates insensitivity specifically to aversive stimuli paired with reinforcement, and both are types of behavioral inflexibility. With regard to ARD, when EtOH consumption itself becomes insensitive to aversive consequences, individuals may be at risk for developing more extreme, compulsive drinking. There is thus a critical need to understand the varied behavioral and neurobiological paths by which ARD develops.  The central hypothesis of this proposal is that there are different genetic and behavioral paths to compulsive drinking and our long-term goal is to understand the relationship between behavioral inflexibility and EtOH- seeking and drinking in order to develop pharmacological interventions that target the risky phenotypes as a way to control or prevent compulsive drinking. The objectives of this application are to: 1) expand the identification of the unique risk endophenotypes to habit formation and ARD in the selected rat lines in both sexes, and 2) determine the differences in functionality of the underlying neural circuity of these genetic lines and behaviors.  The positive impact of our proposed work is the capacity to understand the genetic, behavioral, and neurobiological factors that contribute to the development of ARD, when alcoholism becomes harder to treat. By understanding these factors, we can better understand how to develop appropriate interventions."
"9446526","Glioblastoma (GBM), the most common and deadly adult primary brain tumor, is notoriously resistant to therapy, not only because of its unique biology, including Glioma Stem-like Cells (GSCs), but also because of the delivery challenges imposed by the blood-brain and blood-tumor barriers. Thus, there is an urgent need to identify effective GBM-specific therapeutics and to elucidate strategies for delivering these new agents. A promising new approach is treatment with microRNAs (miRs), which are small, noncoding RNAs that are powerful regulators of gene expression. We have shown that restoration of tumor suppressor miRs is capable of killing GSCs and, therefore, treatment with miRs is potentially a new paradigm in GBM therapy. However, it is currently unknown which miRs will be most effective against GBMs and how these miRs should be delivered. This grant is significant because it directly addresses both of these problems by identifying the most effect anti-GBM miRs and by developing exosomes derived from bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) as a new delivery strategy for these miRs. Exosomes are naturally occurring nanovesicles that function as intercellular transport vehicles. We hypothesize that miRs can be used as effective therapeutics against GBMs, and that exosomes derived from cultured MSCs can be used to systemically deliver these antiglioma miRs. Aim 1 will identify miRs that are most effective against GSCs. In an in vitro high-throughput screen (HTS) of 578 miRs against a panel of GSCs, we have already identified 50 antiglioma miRs that effectively kill GSCs in vitro. This aim will use an in vivo HTS to determine which of the 50 top candidates is most effective against orthotopic GSCs in mice, and it will define the most effective miR combinations. Mechanistic studies will identify the target(s) responsible for the anti-GBM effects. Aim 2 will develop MSC-derived exosomes as novel delivery vehicles of antiglioma miRs. We have shown that after transduction with lentiviruses containing antiglioma miRs, MSCs package the miRs into exosomes (called Exos-miRs) and secrete the Exo-miRs into the culture medium. These Exo-miRs can be isolated and delivered systemically, after which they home to GSCs and inhibit target genes. This aim will define the optimal dose/schedule of Exos-miRs using bioluminescence imaging and a novel TET-reporter system. This dose/schedule will be used to test the efficacy and safety of the best antiglioma miRs or miR combinations identified in Aim 1. Aim 3 will elucidate the mechanisms underlying the ability of Exos-miRs to home to GBMs. By using proteomic analyses to compare strongly homing exosomes (MSC-Exos) with poorly homing ones (fibroblast-Exos), we have identified candidate homing proteins. In this aim, we will perform functional analyses to determine the extent to which the identified proteins mediate the homing of Exo-miRs to GBMs. Successful completion of this grant will result in a new and integrated agent/delivery paradigm that uses miRs to treat GBMs and MSC-derived exosomes to deliver these miRs, and that has the potential to improve the survival of the estimated 15,000 people who die of GBM each year due to the current lack of effective therapy for this disease."
"9442434","PROJECT SUMMARY  Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in the United States. Millions of vascular bypass, angioplasty and stenting procedures are performed each year to repair or replace diseased blood vessels. Up to 15-50% of angioplasties, 16-30% of saphenous vein bypass grafts, and up to 90% of synthetic coronary bypass grafts fail due to intimal hyperplasia within 1-3 years. Intimal hyperplasia, triggered by endothelial injury and/or mechanical injury to the vessel wall induces platelet activation and stimulates secretion of SMC mitogens such as platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF). PDGF stimulates smooth muscle cell (SMC) proliferation, migration and extracellular matrix (ECM) synthesis; ultimately leading to vessel occlusion. Intimal hyperplasia can be prevented with medications that inhibit platelet aggregation and SMC proliferation, but there are currently no approved drugs that arrest or reverse intimal growth.  A major obstacle to the development of new, more effective drugs is the lack of experimental models that mimic the characteristics of human intimal hyperplasia initiation and progression. Human vascular disease research predominantly depends on mouse models, although IH lesions in mice do not mimic human disease. As a result, drugs that succeeded in animal studies have failed in clinical trials. Cell culture and 3D tissues have been used as in vitro and ex vivo models to test vascular therapies. However, these systems are either in limited supply (e.g., human blood vessels), or fail to replicate the complex cell-cell, cell-ECM, and mechanical interactions characteristic of human blood vessels with intimal hyperplasia.  To meet the need for vascular disease models for drug screening, our lab developed a novel, modular tissue fabrication approach that allows spatial customization of engineered tissue structure and function, giving us the unique ability to create 3D in vitro human vascular tissue that mimics the structural and mechanical features of human intimal hyperplasia. In the proposed project, we will fabricate tissue tubes from modular ring- shaped units of self-assembled human smooth muscle cells. We have also shown that gelatin microspheres can be incorporated within tissue rings during self-assembly to achieve growth factor delivery. To stimulate intimal hyperplasia in our vascular tissue model, PDGF-loaded microspheres will be incorporated within tissue rings to stimulate SMC proliferation. PDGF-loaded ring units will be fused with control SMC rings to form tubes. The tubes will be transferred to a custom bioreactor, seeded with endothelial cells and exposed to luminal fluid flow. The model will be validated by treating model human blood vessels with approved drugs to treat intimal hyperplasia. We will measure SMC proliferation and collagen synthesis, and the resulting effects on vascular tissue wall thickness, cross-sectional area and regional wall mechanics. We hypothesize that PDGF-loaded microspheres incorporated within engineered tissue rings and tubes will stimulate SMC proliferation and ECM synthesis in spatially defined regions that mimic the structure and function of human intimal hyperplasia."
"9408975","Abstract An estimated 3 million Americans have chronic Hepatitis C (HCV) infection, and of those, up to 25% are co- infected with HIV. Of the new HCV infections, 80% occur in people who inject drugs (PWID) and successful treatment strategies for this core group are required to break this epidemic. Directly acting antiviral agents (DAAs) are new non-immune based therapies to treat HCV and are effective in treating HCV with HIV co-infection; still individuals with co-infection have more rapid progression of hepatic fibrosis and worse clinical outcomes than those with HCV mono-infection. PWID with HIV infection have significantly higher rates of re-infection and liver disease progression even after achieving sustained virologic response (SVR). It is critical to investigate the long- term durability of SVR in these high-risk populations in order to identify probable factors that contribute to HCV recurrence. Our group has been studying HCV treatment responses (including HIV positive PWID patients) in Baltimore and District of Columbia. We showed that in patients achieving SVR with DAA therapy, HCV specific T cell immunity is recovered in contrast to those with relapse of HCV. We are seeking to identify immune correlates of successful treatment response, especially in high-risk groups, with the goal of identifying persistent defects in virus specific immune recovery that may hamper durability of SVR. In this proposal, we will seek to 1) investigate the improvement in liver disease with SVR and HCV re-infection rates post SVR in HIV/HCV co- infected patients with or without current injection drug use 2) explore the impact of HIV/HCV co-infection and current injection drug use on recovery and maintenance of HCV-specific peripheral CD4 and CD8 T- cell responses after DAA therapy and 3) characterize the persistence of hepatic immune defects after SVR in HIV/HCV co-infected high-risk patient groups. Through these specific aims, we will elucidate the immune mechanisms and factors that drive re-infection in HIV/HCV co-infected PWID. We hypothesize that DAA-based eradication of HCV will result in augmentation of virus specific adaptive immunity, the lack of which may be associated with adverse outcomes in HIV/HCV co-infected patients and current PWID. We will employ standard and novel research techniques, including measuring soluble and cellular markers of inflammation and immune activation, conventional flow cytometry and novel mass cytometry for immunophenotyping diverse lymphocyte populations in periphery and liver and hepatic transcriptome sequencing to quantify HCV-specific immunity in these patients. Our proposal will provide valuable insights in protective immunity against HCV in HIV/HCV co- infected PWID who are at highest risk of reinfection and disease progression and are at the core of HCV epidemic. This will help us identify patients that may require additional intervention, and pave the way for development of innovative preventive strategies targeting HIV infected PWID enabling us to disrupt the ongoing HCV epidemic."
"9434763","Campylobacter is a major human pathogen that infects an estimated 2.5 million people each year resulting in an estimated $1.9 billion economic loss in the U.S. Campylobacter jejuni is a common human enteric pathogen that causes acute enterocolitis and increases the risk of developing long-term intestinal dysfunction such as post- infectious irritable bowel syndrome. The innate immune mechanisms responsible for intestinal pathology in C. jejuni-induced colitis are still poorly understood. Innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) are a heterogeneous family of novel regulators of both protective and pathogenic responses in the gut. However, the cellular and molecular mechanisms of protective versus pathogenic responses mediated by distinct populations of ILCs are scantily understood. This gap of knowledge severely limits the development of novel therapies to treat the disease. Therefore, a deeper understanding of the role of ILCs in the pathogenesis of infectious colitis and associated sequelae is needed to develop better therapeutic approaches that control intestinal inflammation and protection against mucosal pathogens. Our exciting preliminary data strongly suggest that a unique population of IFN?- producing ILCs that lack natural cytotoxicity receptors (NCR) promotes colitis in a mouse model of C. jejuni infection. Intriguingly, we revealed that the transcription factor ROR?t plays a critical role in the development and/or maintenance of these NCR-ILC1s. The overall objective of this proposal is to understand the role of these ILCs in promoting infectious colitis. Our working model is that during the course of C. jejuni infection, ILC3s undergo conversion to a unique population of IFN?-producing NCR-ILC1s, which promotes intestinal pathology. To test this hypothesis, we propose three specific aims. In Aim 1, we will determine the developmental origin of pathogenic IFN?-producing NCR-ILC1s using a genetic cell fate-mapping approach. In Aim 2, we will determine the colitogenic potential of NCR-ILC1s using an adoptive cell transfer approach. In Aim 3, we will determine the relevance of these NCR-ILC1s to human disease in mice with a reconstituted human immune system. Completion of these aims will lead to a better understanding of the ILC-dependent mechanisms that control intestinal inflammation. The research proposed is significant because it will address a critical gap in our understanding of the role of ILCs in promoting intestinal inflammation. Together, this knowledge will guide future efforts to identify targets to rationally design therapeutic strategies that limit intestinal inflammation. These studies will also generate new knowledge in basic ILC biology in a tractable murine model of a major bacterial pathogen."
"9508210","Parasitic helminths exhibit the remarkable ability to establish chronic, often lifelong, infections by triggering multiple mechanisms to dampen the host immune response. These immunoregulatory pathways protect the host from excessive infection-induced tissue damage, and can be exploited for new therapies to treat inflammation. Using transgenic mice that express human resistin (hRetn) and Nippostrongylus brasiliensis as a mouse model of geohelminth infection, we identified hRetn as an immunomodulatory protein that impaired helminth expulsion but was critically protective in a mouse model of sepsis involving injection of a fatal dose of LPS. Mechanistically, hRetn bound the LPS receptor TLR4 and inhibited LPS binding and signaling. Based on these results, we hypothesize that the function of helminth-induced resistin is to dampen excessive LPS-induced inflammatory responses, which may arise from helminth- induced tissue damage or sepsis. We propose to elucidate the mechanism by which helminth- induced hRetn protects against sepsis and generate new hRetn fusion proteins to treat LPS- induced inflammation. In Aim 1, we will examine how helminth-induced hRetn regulates LPS- induced pathogenesis and if this regulatory pathway is dependent on TLR4. In Aim 2, we will generate new hRetn proteins fused with human Fc immunoglobulin and hRetn peptides that can be used therapeutically to treat sepsis."
"9391966","ABSTRACT- Structural Biology (STRBIO) Shared Resource  The Structural Biology shared resource is a ?super core? in the basic group that provides an integrated  platform of expertise, education, and infrastructure that creates an accessible environment for LCCC  researchers to undertake structural biology projects. The Core specializes in three major branches of structural  biology: high-resolution studies using X-ray crystallography, multi-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance  spectroscopy and structural bioinformatics and computational methods. These areas are complemented by our  recent investments for the streamlined production of purified and functional proteins for structural work. The  Core provides state-of-the-art equipment and specialized expertise to guide users through any and all stages  of structure determination projects: homology modeling, construct design, protein expression & purification,  crystallization, structure determination, structure analysis, biophysical studies, molecular dynamics studies,  presentation & publication. These services are being used by LCCC researchers to understand fundamental  cellular processes that contribute to cancer. From a more translational perspective, the STRBIO is also  instrumental for the support of LCCC researchers undertaking efforts to develop drugs and macromolecular  therapeutics. This support derives from our capacity to produce atomic-resolution structures of macromolecular  targets bound to lead compounds, as well as our capacity to produce large amounts of protein reagents for  high-throughput screens and biological studies. The Core is led by a team of highly experienced structural  biologists with proven track records in cancer-related research. During the fiscal year ending July 2014, the  STRBIO was used by 35 LCCC members which was 85% of total usage and an 80% increase in users relative  to the equivalent period in 2009 to 2010 and corresponding to the last competitive renewal of this application.  Highlights for the STRBIO during the last funding period include extensive expansion of our protein production  and purification services, the integration of these services with our macromolecular X-ray crystallography core  in newly renovated space, and the acquisition of an 850 MHz NMR spectrometer necessitating the relocation  of our NMR facilities into the newly built Marsico Hall. These studies include high-impact research published by  LCCC members in top-tier journals, including: ACS Med. Chem., Science, Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol., PNAS, Nat.  Chem. Biol., and Sci. Signal. For 2015, the LCCC requests $81,088 to support proteins expression and  purification efforts. CCSG funds are projected to be 14% of operating costs."
"9389368","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Under-perception of asthma symptoms in children is a major risk factor for emergency department visits, hospitalizations, and near-fatal/fatal asthma attacks. Puerto Rican and Black children have greater asthma morbidity and mortality rates than all other racial/ethnic groups. Interventions targeting asthma symptom perception and medication adherence may help close this asthma health disparities gap. There are no RCT studies to date designed to improve asthma symptom perception in ethnic minority children. This R01 study builds upon this new investigator PI's prior grants. We demonstrated that children who did not receive peak expiratory flow (PEF) feedback under-perceived asthma symptoms 42% of the time vs. 15% for the PEF feedback group and had lower controller medication adherence (27.5% vs. 48.8%).  The proposed randomized controlled trial consists of two arms: PEF feedback (N = 130) versus control feedback (N = 130). Latino and Black adolescents with asthma ages 10-17 years old and their caregivers will be recruited from clinics in the Bronx, NY. The primary aims are to examine the efficacy of PEF prediction with feedback versus control feedback on 1) under-perception of asthma symptoms 2) controller medication adherence and 3) asthma control and emergency health care use. These aims will be examined across a 1- year follow-up. An exploratory aim examines the hypothesized pathway that the PEF intervention reduces under-perception of symptoms, shifts illness representations toward the professional model and increases adolescents' and parents' asthma management self-efficacy, resulting in greater medication adherence and improved asthma control. The baseline visit for all families consists of standardized asthma education followed by 3 weeks of PEF prediction without feedback using a programmable, electronic spirometer. Participants then will be randomized to intervention group and their spirometer reprogrammed, showing either the actual PEF and daily asthma management messages (PEF feedback group) or a brief, positive message (control feedback group). For the next 6 weeks, all adolescents will predict their PEF, which will be locked in before blowing into the device. Families will return at mid-intervention and post-intervention to receive verbal individualized feedback on symptom perception and problem-solving skills training (PEF feedback group) or supportive counseling (control feedback group). All adolescents will play Quest for the Code to reinforce the baseline asthma education. At the post-intervention visit, the spirometer will be reprogrammed for all adolescents to provide no feedback for the next 4 weeks. These symptom perception data will be downloaded at 1-month post-intervention. Controller medication adherence will be monitored by electronic devices. Post-intervention sessions will take place at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months to collect adherence data and conduct spirometry. Physicians will be blinded to group assignment and rate asthma control using national guidelines. A 12-month retrospective medical record abstraction will compare emergency health care use for asthma between groups."
"9465990","Project Summary/Abstract: The objective of this proposal is to perform proof-of-concept experiments on a new hand-held surgical instru- ment that provides dexterity at the tip of a rigid bronchoscope. This approach is less invasive than traditional open surgery, and will be safer than the current rigid bronchoscopic approach, which lacks dexterity in port-delivered instruments. Our new system will feature needle-sized manipulators deployed through the bronchoscope's port and will enable lateral tool motion for independent tissue manipulation, laser aiming, and visualization, which we hypothesize will make central airway obstruction surgery more accurate and ef?cient. Clinical signi?cance comes from the many patients affected by central airway obstruction ? over 80,000 per year in the USA alone [5, 7] ? as well as the severity for individual patients, since lack of an adequate airway is fatal. Existing surgical approaches are challenging because instruments deployed through bronchoscope ports lack lateral dexterity, and consequently complication rates are high (32% of patients will have complications including broken teeth, cervical spine injury, hemorrhage, and even death). Innovation comes from using elastic interactions in curved tubes to create needle-size manipulators that can bend and elongate. This enables us to make manipulators small enough to pass through the port in a clinical bronchoscope to provide tentacle-like dexterity at its tip. Our system will also be innovative because it will be the ?rst commercial robotic system designed for central airway surgery, and because it will be a small hand-held tool rather than a large, complicated system in which the surgeon sits at a console remote from the patient and teleoperates a large multi-arm robot that surrounds the patient. Our new hand-held paradigm is advantageous from both a work?ow and cost perspective, because it is compact with dramatically fewer mechanical and elec- tronic components, and so has the potential to be an order of magnitude less expensive than the surgical robots on the market today. Our approach in Aim 1 is to create a hand-held unit that clips onto the back of the bronchoscope and enables the surgeon to control our proposed needle-sized, tentacle-like instruments. Accomplishing this will require hardware adaptations to an existing concentric tube actuation unit prototype developed in an academic laboratory (technology that will be transferred to Virtuoso Surgical via this project), as well as the design and manufacturing of tubes customized for the requirements of central airway obstruction surgery. In Aim 2, we experimentally validate the feasibility of removing central airway obstructions in anthropomorphic phantoms and an ex vivo insuf?ated porcine lung model. The end result of this Phase I STTR project will be experimental validation of the feasibility of resecting central airway tumors with our new hand-held robot paradigm. This will set the stage for the development of a sterilizable, biocompatible product in the context of a follow-on Phase II project."
"9445903","PROJECT SUMMARY The monoamines, which include dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin, are evolutionarily conserved neurotransmitters that modulate the activity of excitatory and inhibitory neurons throughout the entire brain, and are thus essential for diverse aspects of physiology and behavior. Abnormalities of monoamine systems contribute to numerous brain disorders including schizophrenia, depression, and Parkinson's disease. We recently developed viral-genetic tools to determine the input, output, and input?output relationships of a given neuronal population at the scale of the entire mouse brain, and discovered contrasting input?output architectures between locus coeruleus norepinephrine neurons and midbrain dopamine neurons. Here, we apply these tools to study the organization and function of the dorsal raphe (DR) serotonin system, which provides major serotoninergic input to the forebrain to regulate diverse  . functions and brain states including mood, impulsivity, anxiety, as well as hunger and thirst.  Using rabies-mediated trans-synaptic tracing, we previously defined the input architecture to the entire populations of DR-serotonin and DR-GABA neurons However, our unpublished work revealed considerable heterogeneity within the DR serotonin system and suggests that it consists of parallel sub- systems that differ in input, output, and neurotransmitter phenotypes. We propose that each DR serotonin sub-system may carry out a specific subset of the diverse functions ascribed to the DR-serotonin neurons.  We plan to complete our characterization of the anatomical organization of the DR serotonin sub- systems, addressing the questions of how axons of each sub-system divide up the projections of the entire DR serotonin system, and what is the input?output relationship for each DR serotonin sub-system. These will lay a foundation for all future studies of DR-serotonin neurons. We also propose to identify behavioral functions of a subset of these sub-systems by manipulating and recording serotonin neuron subtypes in anxiety- and depression-like states known to involve serotonin, as well as new behavioral paradigms. Finally, because previous studies and our own unpublished data suggest a strong link between serotonin and thirst, we will explore the circuit and cellular mechanisms by which serotonin regulates thirst-motivated behavior using quantitative and sensitive assays we have established based on a technique we developed to gain genetic access of thirst-activated neurons. The integration of anatomical, physiological, and behavioral studies on genetic-, projection-, and activity-defined neuronal populations proposed here will help dissect the complex serotonin system into specific sub-systems and advance our understanding of how serotonin modulates diverse physiological functions and behaviors."
"9387439","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Patients with type 1 diabetes (T1D) suffer excess mortality and morbidity from cardiovascular disease (CVD), but the underlying mechanisms are not fully explained by known CVD risk factors. We have recently discovered that experimental myocardial infarction (MI) in NOD mice, a model for T1D, triggers a chronic post- MI autoimmune syndrome (PIA) characterized by myocardial lymphocytic infiltration, infarct expansion, high- titer cardiac autoantibodies (AAb) and T cell responses against cardiac myosin. We further showed that PIA could be prevented by inducing T-cell tolerance to cardiac myosin. Extending these findings to T1D patients and modeling on the biochemical assays that are widely used for islet AAb detection, we developed a panel of fluid-phase assays for cardiac AAb detection and demonstrated positivity in 83% of post-MI T1D patients. We further identified shared AAb signatures between post-MI T1D patients and myocarditis patients without T1D, and confirmed the presence of myocarditis by cardiac MRI in T1D patients. We have recently found that positivity for these AAb signatures is associated with markedly higher post-MI mortality in T1D patients. We hypothesize that PIA represents a 'missing' pathogenic process that contributes to worse CVD outcomes in patients with T1D. However, while these findings are strongly suggestive of a PIA syndrome in T1D, these studies were cross-sectional and could not establish causality between MI and cardiac autoimmunity. In addition, we have recently observed a relationship between high HbA1C levels and expression of cardiac AAb in a young adult cohort without clinical heart disease. Here, we propose to use the DCCT/EDIC biosamples and clinical data to: 1. Define the relationship between MI and cardiac autoimmunity in T1D by measuring the time course of appearance and specificities of cardiac AAb in longitudinally collected pre- and post- MI samples from DCCT/EDIC. Determine whether there is an association between expression of cardiac AAb and poor post-MI CVD outcomes; 2. Examine the association between glycemic control and cardiac autoimmunity by comparing the frequencies of cardiac AAb in subjects from the DCCT Primary Prevention conventional cohort with mean HbA1c ?9.0%, to subjects in the intensive cohort with mean HbA1c ?7.0% and; 3. Determine whether CMRI-defined myocardial scar correlates with positivity for cardiac AAb and whether the presence of cardiac AAb is associated with CMRI evidence of cardiac dysfunction. These studies will be the first to immunologically characterize the DCCT/EDIC cohort that has been deeply phenotyped with respect to diabetic complications. To this end, I have assembled an outstanding team with expertise in diabetic heart disease (Beckman), CMRI of the DCCT/EDIC cohort (Bluemke) and biostatistics (Keenan). The wealth of samples and clinical data in the NIDDK Repository provides a unique opportunity to test our hypothesis that cardiac autoimmunity contributes to the burden CVD in T1D. These results could open a new window on the etiology of CVD in T1D, and have important diagnostic and therapeutic implications for this major cause of T1D mortality."
"9453481","SUMMARY: CONSEQUENCE OF AGE-INDUCED SHIFT IN B CELL SUBSETS With age the generation of naive helper T cells and follicular B cells, that are both needed for the generation of high affinity antibody (Ab), become compromised and current vaccines for the elderly that depend on inducing these, become ineffective. Thus the elderly, though protected by Ab already in place for pathogens encountered earlier in life, are highly susceptible to new strains of virus and newly emerged pathogens. We noted the generation of an unusual population of antibody-secreting B cells to live influenza infection in aged mice, that is derived by stimulation of recently described age-associated B cells (ABC). These induced ABC (iABC) are generated independently of CD4 T cell help, but seem to depend on stimulation by pathogen- associated danger signals. Live Influenza infection induces substantial iABC making influenza-specific Ab indicating this pathway may contribute significantly to protective immunity to influenza. If so it is important to define how ABC develop, and what signals optimally drive them to become iABC -producing Ab and possible some kind of long-lived memory. Here we will determine if the ABC response can indeed be harnessed to provide protective Ab responses against influenza in aged mice. Have developed transfer approaches that allow us to evaluate whether ABC or the Ab produced by ABC in response to by influenza A virus can provide protection against lethal virus, and can effective neutralize or otherwise clear infection with influenza especially in the contest of the elderly host. If we find the aged ABC make a strong contribution to immunity in otherwise compromised aged hosts, it will justify a major effort to define the pathways that effectively induce ABC response so they can be harnessed in future to improve vaccines and therapies for the aged."
"9457917","ABSTRACT  Changes in the abundance and phenotypes of adipose tissue immune cells are a major determinant of systemic inflammation and insulin resistance during excess weight gain. Adipocyte expression of the class II major histocompatibility complex (MHCII) occurs early during high-fat diet (HFD) challenge and parallels pro- inflammatory changes in MHCII-activated CD4+ adipose resident T cells (ARTs) implicating the adipocyte as an instigator of obesity-induced inflammation. Adipocyte-specific MHCII null (aMHCII-/-) mice created to test this hypothesis 1) developed substantially less visceral adipose tissue (VAT) inflammation than their wild-type (WT) littermates when challenged with HFD, despite identical changes in body weight and %body fat, 2) had markedly more VAT regulatory T cells (Tregs), but not in other peripheral sites; 3) were more insulin sensitive with better glucose homeostasis and 4) when bred into an atherosclerosis prone LDLR-/- background, attenuated accelerated atherosclerosis without affecting plasma cholesterol and triglyceride levels. Tregs are a major component of the CD4+ ART population in lean mice, where they suppress inflammation to maintain normal VAT metabolism, but dramatically decrease during HFD-challenge. However, VAT Tregs are preserved in HFD-fed aMHCII-/- mice, which likely explains the improved metabolic and cardiovascular phenotype in these mice. The aMHCII-/- mutation, thus, provides a unique opportunity to specifically alter adipose inflammation, independent of obesity, dyslipidemia, and changes in peripheral T cells to investigate its impact on obesity- induced complications, particularly atherosclerosis. We hypothesize that decreased adipose inflammation attenuates atherosclerosis even in the presence of obesity. Specific Aims will address: 1) the effect of A) aMHCII-deficiency and B) visceral adipose tissue (VAT)-specific Treg depletion (via cells with defective VAT Treg homeostasis or an IL-33 receptor blocking antibody which inhibits IL-33-induced VAT Treg proliferation) on diet-induced atherosclerosis; 2) whether A) constitutive, adipocyte-specific MHCII overexpression promotes adipose inflammation to enhance atherosclerosis, and B) administration of IL-33 attenuates atherosclerosis through a VAT Treg-dependent mechanism; and 3) changes in the immune cell composition and molecular phenotypes in aortic lesions in mice with and without aMHCII mutations using T cell flow analyses of aorta, laser capture microdissection of plaque macrophages, and investigation of macrophage trafficking from VAT to aorta. The results of this investigation using adipocyte MHCII knock-in/knock-out models and several novel approaches to specifically alter VAT, but not peripheral, Tregs will determine the contributions of adipose tissue inflammation and VAT Tregs to the pathogenesis of obesity-associated atherosclerosis. This mechanistic insight sets the stage for development of better immune-based therapeutic strategies to combat CVD in the setting of obesity."
"9378084","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a severe progressive neurodegenerative disease characterized by degeneration of motor neurons in the brain and spinal cord, resulting in neurogenic muscle wasting, paralysis, and death. Nearly 95% of ALS cases have pathology featuring ubiquitinated and hyperphosphorylated inclusions of the TDP-43 protein in neurons and glial cells. Similar inclusions of TDP-43 are hallmarks of another neurodegenerative disease, frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD-TDP), which is a major cause of mid- to late-life dementia. An understanding of the mechanisms controlling TDP-43 pathology in ALS and FTLD-TDP is critical to the design of neuroprotective strategies. TDP-43 is directly phosphorylated by the kinase CDC7, and this phosphorylation drives TDP-43 neurotoxicity and resultant neurodegeneration. This proposal describes experiments exploring the cellular and molecular changes that promote TDP-43 targeted CDC7 kinase activity, with a focus on the development of therapeutic interventions for the treatment of TDP-43 proteinopathies such as ALS and FTLD-TDP.  Disease specific changes in CDC7 may promote TDP-43 phosphorylation. In fact, increased CDC7 protein levels and post-translational modifications of CDC7 are observed in parallel with pathological TDP-43 phosphorylation in a mammalian cell model of TDP-43 phosphorylation. CDC7 protein levels, localization, post-translational modifications, and gene expression will be evaluated in mouse primary neuron culture, mammalian cell culture, and transgenic C. elegans models exhibiting TDP-43 phosphorylation using molecular biology, biochemistry, and genetics techniques. Characterizing disease-relevant changes in CDC7 will further our understanding of the causes of TDP-43 pathology in ALS and FTLD-TDP.  To identify pathway(s) controlling CDC7 kinase activation in neurons, CDC7 kinase regulators, pathway genes, and co-factors have been surveyed for effects on TDP-43 phosphorylation. The DNA damage response (DDR) pathway was identified by this screen as a key regulator of TDP-43 phosphorylation. Components of the DDR pathway will be evaluated in detail using mouse primary neurons, C. elegans and mammalian cell models of TDP-43 proteinopathy. The determination of the genes and gene pathways regulating TDP-43 targeted CDC7 kinase activity will provide insight into disease pathobiology, and potentially identify novel therapeutic targets for intervention.  CDC7 is a promising therapeutic target for th inhibition of pathological TDP-43 phosphorylation that is observed in ALS and FTLD-TDP. However, small molecule inhibitors specific for CDC7 with appropriate pharmacokinetics in vivo are not commercially available. Therefore, a targeted library of small molecules structurally similar to CDC7 inhibitors will be assembled. These small molecules will be surveyed for specific inhibition of CDC7 kinase activity, and tested in vivo in C. elegans and in mammalian cell culture models for protection against TDP-43 driven neurodegeneration. This is a critical step towards developing viable treatments for ALS and FTLD-TDP."

"9447992","Heart failure (HF) is a major cause of death, yet understanding of the underlying mechanisms is still limited and treatment options are few at best. This proposal focuses on the elastic protein titin, a recently revealed major player in heart failure, and addresses the basic biology of the poorly understood but clinically important A-band segment of the molecule, the mechanistic basis of its contribution to heart failure, and its potential as a therapeutic target. Titin, the largest known protein, comprises the third myofilament of muscle and spans from the Z-disk to the M-band of the sarcomere. Titin?s I-band region is known to function as a complex molecular spring that is a dominant contributor to passive myocardial stiffness. The A-band segment is the least well- studied part of titin and its functions are largely obscure. Yet several recent landmark sequencing studies in large groups of patients revealed that the A-band segment of titin is particularly important in familial dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), a common type of heart failure with a prevalence of up to 1:250. Many of the DCM mutations in TTN are truncation variants (TTNtv), most of these are found in the A-band segment of titin, with a phenotype that appears to be more severe the closer the mutation occurs to titin?s C-terminus. In Aim 1 we propose to critically examine the biology of the A-band segment of titin with a focus on where most disease- causing mutations are located, titin?s D-zone and C-zone. Mouse models were created for this purpose in which these regions within the A-band segment of titin were targeted. We propose to study in these models the ultrastructure of the A-band region of the sarcomere, transcript and protein expression (titin, cMyBP-C) and posttranslational-modification (PTMs), as well as heart function. Pilot studies with a novel C-zone deletion model reveal deranged thick filament length and the development of DCM, which provides a unique opportunity to study mechanisms of titin-based DCM. Additional models will be investigated in Aim 2 in which disease-causing TTNtvs were introduced in different regions of titin?s A-band segment. These models will be studied at baseline and when stressed; the severity of their phenotype will be studied as a function of the location of the TTNtv. In parallel, protein expression and structural and functional studies will be conducted on biopsies from DCM patients with TTNtvs. Aim 3 will investigate the new concept in the titin field that TTN is a modifier gene in which disease severity can be explained by a combination of mutations in TTN and other genes. This will be studied by crossing the TTNtv models with mice that carry clinically relevant mutations in other sarcomeric genes. Finally, through excision of the mutated titin exons, we will test the therapeutic potential of exon skipping for treating titin-based DCM. With its basic science and translational goals and its in-depth and integrative approach, this application seeks to continue our track record of cutting edge titin research. Powerful techniques and novel mouse models are in place and pilot data are supportive of our guiding hypotheses. The proposed research is likely to enhance insights in the function of titin titin, including its potential as a therapeutic target.  "
"9427283","PROJECT SUMMARY:  Cardiogenic shock develops in 7-10% of patients with acute Myocardial Infarction (MI), and has a high mortality ranging 50-70%. Short-term Left Ventricular (LV) unloading is a new concept that became a reality with the recent emergence of powerful percutaneous Left Ventricular Assist Devices (pLVAD)s, which offers significant promise for improving the outcomes of the patients with cardiogenic shock. Several clinical and pre- clinical studies demonstrated clear improvement in hemodynamics using these devices, however no clinical studies have so far shown improvement in 30-day clinical outcome. Current data suggest that pLVADs improve hemodynamics and very acute clinical outcome (~24hr), but the functional recovery of injured heart during LV support is often not sufficient to maintain the hemodynamics after the devices are removed, resulting in only slowing of the death.  Large amount of research focus on short-term LV unloading is on the acute changes in hemodynamics and when, how, and to whom we introduce these devices. In contrast, little is studied on how we exit from these device therapies. Here, in order to maximize the benefit of pLVADs use for cardiogenic shock, we propose to study key elements that may influence functional recovery of native heart after LV unloading with pLVADs. Specifically, we propose to study 1) impact of LV re-loading, 2) impact of cardiac molecular alterations associated with LV unloading, and 3) adjunctive approach to boost cardiac functional recovery.  Our central hypothesis is that initiation of LV unloading as well as re-loading negatively influence cardiac function, and additional therapy is required to improve the clinical outcomes of patients with cardiogenic shock treated with pLVADs. To test our central hypothesis we propose below Specific Aims. Specific Aim 1. Define the impact of LV re-loading Specific Aim 2. Define the impact of LV unloading on post-translational modification in key cardiac proteins Specific Aim 3. Use gene therapy to promote myocardial recovery  Our study will increase the understanding of molecular changes in the heart after LV unloading and re- loading. As we foresee increase in pLVADs use for patients with cardiogenic shock, identifying the potential harm and developing ways to improve current low survival with short-term LV unloading has a significant clinical impact."
"9324718","Dementia is a devastating clinical syndrome that affects millions of elderly individuals worldwide. Treating patients with dementia is challenging because of the myriad number of pathologies underlying its clinical manifestation and progression. Therefore, it is imperative to better understand the various mechanisms of dementia-inducing diseases in order to correctly diagnose and treat dementia patients. The focus of my proposed project is to study a common, but relatively underappreciated and under-studied, mechanism of dementia characterized by vascular abnormalities, hippocampal shrinkage, and abnormal protein accumulation (TDP-43) in the brain. Our lab has published several studies on two dementia-associated pathologies: hippocampal sclerosis of aging (HS-Aging) and brain arteriolosclerosis (B-ASC). HS-Aging is a common neurodegenerative pathology seen in up to 25% of individuals < 85 years at autopsy. B- ASC is a cerebrovascular pathology that increases in frequency and severity with advanced age. We have identified a common genetic risk variant in the ABCC9 gene with a polymorphism that changes risk for both B-ASC and HS-Aging pathologies. This phenomenon is exciting because it may point the way to a novel future therapeutic intervention related to ABCC9-modulating drugs. As a key step to better understanding the pathogenetic mechanism, new experiments are required. My overall hypothesis is that genetic and pharmacological perturbations in ABCC9 or its gene product lead to B-ASC pathology, which in turn, lead to HS-Aging/TDP-43 resulting in the clinical presentation of dementia. We will address this hypothesis through the following specific aims: 1) Test the hypothesis that a SNP, ABCC9.rs704180, is associated with altered vascular structure in aged individuals and 2) Test the hypothesis that chronic pharmacologic inhibition of ABCC9 gene product will cause B-ASC, thus in turn, exacerbating HS-Aging/TDP-43 pathology. In Aim 1, we will use human tissue samples from the University of Kentucky Alzheimer's Disease Center brain bio-bank to quantify vascular structures in individuals with varying ABCC9 SNP status. In Aim 2, we will treat mice with clinical and pathological HS-Aging characteristics (age-related TDP-43 pathology) to determine the effects of ABCC9 modifying drug treatment in these animals. Successful completion of this project will provide insight into a novel mechanism of dementia. In addition, it will provide opportunities for me to diversify my skillset as I prepare for a future career as a physician-scientist in the field of translational neuroscience research."
"9463308","PROJECT SUMMARY  Viruses, especially DNA viruses, elicit DNA damage responses (DDRs) in infected cells which are innate, critical barriers that can either impede or facilitate virus replication, and so must be successfully negotiated for infection to succeed. Replication of the parvovirus minute virus of mice (MVM) induces a sustained cellular DNA damage response (DDR) which the virus then exploits to enhance its infection in host cells. The Parvovirinae are small non-enveloped icosahedral viruses that are important pathogens in many animal species including humans. They are the only known viruses of vertebrates that contain single-stranded linear DNA genomes, and thus, present novel replicative DNA structures to cells during infection. They rely extensively on cellular processes for replication. This F32 application proposes a comprehensive and intensive training program whose scientific objective is to further investigate how MVM exploits the cellular DDR to prepare the nuclear environment for effective parvovirus takeover, focusing on the following aims:  Aim 1: Identify where MVM establishes infection and characterize how its proximity to the host- genome changes temporally. Successful MVM replication leads to the formation of viral replication centers in the nuclear environment. It is not known where in the nucleus the virus establishes its replication bodies, and what part of the cellular genome it interacts with. We propose to identify the interactome of MVM replication bodies using chromosome conformation capture assays and how this association evolves throughout infection.  Aim 2: Determine how MVM-NS1 aids in the establishment of viral replication centers. The MVM non-structural protein NS1, essential for viral replication, forms a core component of viral replication centers. Our preliminary data indicates that NS1 binds to cellular DNA at specific sites, perhaps assisting viral genomes as they establish replication centers at these cellular sites. Thus, we propose to identify the binding sites of NS1 throughout the cellular genome, and test the role of NS1 as a mediator of MVM-host interaction  Aim 3: Determine how cellular DNA damage affects virus localization and replication. MVM infection elicits a DDR, leading to cell-cycle defects and the generation of cellular DNA breaks. Accumulation of DDR proteins at cellular sites can serve as hotspots for viral replication to occur. If this is true, engineered DNA breaks at selected sites would be predicted to recruit viral genomes. We propose to test the recruitment of MVM to engineered DNA breaks in a cell-line model, how genome recruitment changes temporally with DNA break induction, and characterize how DDR proteins accumulate over time at these sites.  This work will add fundamental knowledge into how a small DNA virus negotiates the nuclear environment to initiate infection, and provide important information concerning how cells respond to the insult of incoming viral single-stranded DNA. Understanding these processes will elucidate how parvoviruses infect cells and ultimately how they cause disease, persist as gene therapy vehicles, or act as anti-cancer agents."
"9392879","7. Project Summary/Abstract Astrocytes are vital to brain metabolism and help to optimize synaptic function and promote neuronal health. Direct coupling of astrocytes to the extracellular milieu via unapposed hemichannels (uHCs)?made up of connexin 43 (Cx43) proteins?appears to be increased under a variety of pathological conditions. Elevated levels of amyloid-? (A?) peptides and pro-inflammatory cytokines, characteristic of Alzheimer?s disease (AD), lead to greater uHC permeability?which, in turn, impairs neuronal function and viability. In this project, we will test the novel hypothesis that A?-dependent changes in uHCs are mediated, in part, by aberrant activation of the protein phosphatase calcineurin (CN), shown by our lab and others to drive several critical components of the activated astrocyte phenotype. Aim 1 will use a combination of adenoviral vectors and pharmacological agents, in addition to Western blot, ethidium bromide uptake, patch-clamp electrophysiology, and a variety of biochemical assays, to determine whether CN and Cx43 are necessary and sufficient for the effects of A? on the functional status of HCs in primary astrocytes. In addition, this aim will determine the feasibility of using a novel peptide-based reagent, 43Gap52, to selectively disrupt CN/Cx43 interactions without inhibiting CN activity per se. This aim will establish whether aberrant CN/Cx43 interactions in astrocytes are a direct outcome of A? pathology. Aim 2 will use adeno-associated virus (AAV) bearing astrocyte-specific promoters and CN activators (active CN fragment) or CN inhibitors (CN-autoinhibitory peptide or 43Gap52) to selectively modulate astrocytic CN/Cx43 interactions in an intact mouse model of AD. The functional status of astrocytic uHCs will be investigated in acutely prepared brain slices using an EtBr uptake assay, as described for Aim 1. In addition, slice electrophysiology will be used to assess the impact of CN/Cx43 interactions on hippocampal synaptic strength and plasticity. This Aim will validate Aim 1 results in a commonly used animal model of AD, en route to determining the extent to which CN/Cx43 interactions in astrocytes disrupt synaptic function during the progression of A? pathology. These studies will shed light on the role of astrocytic HCs in AD pathophysiology and determine whether disruption of the CN/Cx43 interaction is a feasible strategy for ameliorating neurologic dysfunction due to AD and other types of neurodegenerative disease."
"9471147","ABSTRACT. Tobacco use remains the leading cause of preventable death in the U.S., responsible for more than 440,000 deaths annually, of which 41,000 are attributable to environmental tobacco smoke (ETS). The federal Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) recently passed a rule that will require all public housing agencies (PHAs) to implement smoke free policies in their developments. There is a strong rationale for the new housing policy. Compared to the general public, residents in public housing are at excess risk for ETS exposure for two reasons: (1) Despite overall declines in smoking over time, major disparities persist by income level, education and race/ethnicity. Thus smoking rates among residents living in public housing, a predominantly minority, lower income population, tend to be higher than in the general population. (2) Most public housing residents live in multiunit housing (MUH), an environment that places all residents at elevated risk for involuntary ETS exposure due to smoke accumulation compared to residents living in detached housing. While prohibition of smoking in homes has promising implications for improving health, initiatives to mandate smoke-free housing are still nascent. No empirical studies have objectively evaluated the impact on health outcomes among residents. Estimated health consequences of such policies are currently based on mathematical models, and only a few studies have measured change in resident ETS exposure before and after implementation of housing-wide bans. These studies have mostly been small, with short follow-up periods, and they have given only limited attention to studying the implementation process. To fill this gap, we propose a large-scale natural experiment to examine the impact of the HUD policy on reducing ETS exposure and improving health outcomes. The New York City Housing Authority (NYCHA) is the largest housing authority in the United States, with more than 400,000 residents. Using a quasi-experimental longitudinal design, we plan to monitor ETS before and after policy implementation (tracking every 6 months for 2.5 years post-policy) in 200 apartments of non-smokers and common areas of 10 select high-rise NYCHA buildings, and compare to ETS changes in 200 apartments in 10 demographically matched high-rise buildings in another housing program, not subject to the smoke-free policy. Using geocoded administrative data, citywide NYCHA resident health outcomes will be compared to residents in matched low-income census blocks. Finally we will use survey data, qualitative interviews and focus groups to explore multilevel factors that influence the implementation process and outcomes. This study leverages a strong, ongoing partnership of academic and municipal government investigators, including experts at New York University School of Medicine, senior staff at NYCHA, and leaders from the NYC Department of Health and Mental Hygiene. Findings will be used to develop guidance for implementing SFH policies in public or private MUH settings nationally."
"9461890","From a blood safety perspective, transfusion-transmitted infections involving Babesia spp. have become increasingly problematic world-wide, with increased numbers of cases causing morbidity and mortality reported each year. Therefore the study of this blood-borne parasite should be considered as a priority for transfusion medicine. Our purpose is to identify key erythrocyte proteins and their parasite binding partners that mediate invasion of B. divergens into the human red blood cell (RBC), with the ultimate aim of exploiting parasite molecules found to play key roles in invasion as diagnostic and blood screening tools. The major goal of this application is to take advantage of the progress that has been made in the in vitro production of cultured red blood cells (cRBCs) by expansion of hematopoietic CD34+ cells, coincident with the progress made in the genetic characterization of blood group proteins, to manipulate cRBCs by shRNA mediated knock-down of specific transcripts and to engineer iPSCs by CRISPR/Cas9 knock-out of specific genes to decipher the receptors involved in Babesia invasion. Invasion of the human RBC is the central pathogenic step in the life- cycle of Babesia. Interruption of this step in the cycle would halt infection. This proposal describes how we will (1) generate antigen deficient cRBCs using use shRNA-mediated knockdown of gene expression in CD34+ cells and CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knockout of gene expression in iPSCs. After inducing ex vivo erythropoiesis, B. divergens invasion assays will be carried out in the engineered antigen deficient reticulocytes to identify RBC determinants important for parasite invasion (2) identify cognate parasite ligands using pull down assays and validate the receptor-ligand interactions biochemically and functionally and characterize their role in invasion in the parasite (3) determine the immunogenicity of these ligands using human and animal sera to design suitable ELISA assays for potential use in blood centers. This proposal uniquely will advance basic science methods to enhance production of mature cRBCs in the laboratory, provide insight into developmental regulation of antigen expression and provide a biological target for assessment of host molecules needed for Babesia invasion."

"9385391","Project Summary: Neutrophilic dermatoses, characterized by neutrophil infiltrated inflamed skin, comprises of several diseases that include Sweet's syndrome, pyoderma gangrenosum, subcorneal pustular dermatosis and hidradenitis suppurativa. In a mouse model of neutrophilic dermatosis (Ptpn6spin mutant mice), we showed that IL-1R- mediated inflammatory disease is inflammasome and IL-1? independent; requires IL-1?, and is potentially driven by RIPK1. However, our current understanding of the roles and regulation of IL-1? in inflammatory disease is severely limited. Our preliminary studies show that RIPK1 and TAK1 signaling drive disease and skin inflammation in Ptpn6spin mice. Furthermore, our data suggest that microbiota may play a significant role in regulating IL-1? expression/production by the radioresistant cells that ultimately provokes disease. Thus, the overall goals of this project are to define the upstream events that regulate the mechanisms of IL-1? production in inflammatory disease. In Aim 1, we propose to examine the role of microbiota in directly regulating IL-1?-mediated skin inflammation in Ptpn6spin mice and further identify the specific cell population that are responsible for IL-1? production in the radioresistant compartment. In Aim 2, we will investigate the molecular mechanisms of SHP1-mediated disease induction in Ptpn6spin mice. In brief, we will elucidate how SHP1 regulates myelopoiesis (hallmark of disease), IL-1? induced signaling and RIPK1/TAK1 to regulate skin inflammation. The studies proposed here will break new ground in this area, and will help to uncover novel biomedical targets that function in these understudied inflammatory pathways."

"9588790","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Epithelial ovarian cancer is the fifth leading cause of cancer-related death among woman and has the highest case-fatality rate among gynecologic cancers. High throughput genomic technologies such as gene expression profiling have provided new biomarkers and potential novel therapeutic targets for ovarian cancer. However, comprehensive functional validation studies on both the biological and clinical levels are needed to better understand the mechanistic basis for these biomarkers and realize their clinical significance and application. Fibroblast growth factor 18 (FGF18) has been recently identified as an aberrantly expressed gene within an expression signature predicting poor rate of survival in patients with advanced stage serous ovarian cancers. In addition, genomic amplification of both FGF18 and FGFR4 has been shown to predict for poor overall survival among women with advanced stage high grade serous ovarian cancers. However, the exact role of FGF18/FGFR4 in the clinicopathologic properties of ovarian cancer has not been determined. Preliminary studies demonstrate that FGF18 promotes the in vitro migration and invasion of both ovarian cancer cells and endothelial cells. In SCID mice xenograft models, FGF18 expression in ovarian cancer cells results in increased tumor formation. Microarray analysis demonstrated up-regulation of a large number of proinflammatory cytokines by FGF18 which may mediate the increases in angiogenesis and infiltration of macrophages seen in FGF18 expressing xenografts. This proposal hypothesizes that FGF18/FGFR4 amplification and overexpression significantly modulates both the malignant epithelial and tumor stromal cells which subsequently leads to poorer patient survival. This project will validate the prognostic value of FGF18/FGFR4 axis using a large collection of multi-center clinical trial specimens (GOG218) and delineate the functional role and signaling network of FGF18 in ovarian tumor cells and ovarian tumor stromal cells in vitro and in vivo. Finally, the recently developed FGF trap proteins (from Five Prime Therapeutics Inc.) will be used as proof of principle to target FGF18 as a novel therapeutic intervention against epithelial ovarian cancer."
"9395795","Project Summary/Abstract  Obesity affects more than one out of every three U.S. adults and even higher proportions of African Americans and Latinos. While behavioral weight management interventions tend to have limited scope and are associated with only temporary small weight loss, environmental interventions, such as the provision of infrastructure to support physical activity, have the potential to reach large portions of the population and foster lasting weight control. Active transportation infrastructure (ATI) consists of physical structures that support safe walking and bicycling and include sidewalks, bicycle lanes and paths, and intersections with painted pedestrian crosswalks or pedestrian signals. To date, little is known about the relationship between neighborhood ATI and individual body mass index (BMI). Using secondary data from multiple sources, the proposed observational study will determine whether (a) adults who live in a neighborhood with greater ATI have healthier BMI and (b) adults who live in a neighborhood with greater ATI lose more weight in a weight management program than those living in a neighborhood with less ATI. It will also examine whether these relationships differ by race/ethnicity. The sample will consist of an urban subsample (n=232,000 adults) of the Weight And Veterans Environments Study (WAVES) I, which is a nationwide, retrospective longitudinal study of over 3.2 million veterans receiving healthcare from the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs between 2009 and 2015 (R01CA172726). Using OpenStreetMap data, innovative neighborhood ATI measures will be constructed, including availability and density of sidewalks and bicycle lanes or paths and pedestrian intersection safety. Multivariable regression will estimate associations between ATI and BMI. This study will provide important evidence about whether enhancing ATI through policies and environmental modifications is likely to help people achieve or maintain a healthier body weight. In addition to supporting the completion of the proposed study, this fellowship will support additional research training for the principal investigator including in statistical analysis (e.g., secondary, longitudinal, and spatial data analysis). These experiences and skills will provide a strong foundation for an independent research career focused on enhancing urban environments to improve population and individual health outcomes."
"9395944","Summary/Abstract Aberration of vascular smooth muscle cell (SMC) phenotypes cause structural defects and impaired mechanical properties of artery wall, leading to artery stiffness, which correlates with high blood pressure and is an independent risk factor for the resistant hypertension. It is well-known that arterial wall stiffens with aging. In addition to hypertension, vascular aging is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular diseases including coronary artery disease, stroke and heart failure. However, the factors and mechanisms that control vascular aging, especially SMC aging and artery stiffness, remain largely unknown. Our exciting preliminary data demonstrate that Smad2 plays a critical role in maintaining SMC and vascular homeostasis and blood pressure. SMC-tissue specific deficiency of Smad2 (Smad2sm-/-) in mice causes alterations in elastin and collagen content and structure in the vessel wall, resulting in decreased artery distensibility, increased pulse pressure (indicator of artery stiffness), and increased mean artery pressure. The vascular wall remodeling/stiffness in Smad2 SMC- deficient mice appears to be caused by a premature SMC aging with an elevation in p53 level. In fact, the increase in p53 level along with the decrease in Smad2 expression in artery SMC correlates with the aging in mouse and human. Importantly, the correlation of decreased Smad2 with increased p53 is also closely associated with the onset of hypertension in human. These data strongly support a novel hypothesis that Smad2 maintains vascular homeostasis and blood pressure by inhibiting p53 expression and/or activity in SMC. Using primary culture of SMCs, in vivo Smad2 and p53 SMC-specific knockout mouse models combining with molecular, cellular, histological, and pharmacological approaches, we will 1) test if Smad2 is essential for maintaining the vascular wall elasticity and blood pressure homeostasis; 2) elucidate the mechanism by which Smad2 regulates SMC homeostasis through inhibiting p53 expression/activity; and 3) determine if blockade of p53 attenuates Smad2 deficiency-caused artery stiffness and hypertension. Successful completion of the proposed study will establish a novel mechanism regulating SMC aging and blood pressure homeostasis. It will also allow us to identify potential novel approaches that may be used to develop effective therapeutics for treating aging or artery stiffness-related hypertension."
"9424137","Project Summary About 80 million U.S. adults have hypertension, and hypertension treatment costs the nation about $80 billion annually. Effective and inexpensive antihypertensive medications are available, but many patients remain inadequately treated. The Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial (SPRINT) showed that in high CVD risk patients intensive treatment to a lower systolic blood pressure (SBP, <120 mm Hg) reduced CVD risk and all- cause mortality compared to standard treatment (SBP <140 mm Hg). We estimated that 16.8 million adults in the US meet the SPRINT eligibility criteria. Given this large number of eligible patients and the additional resources (e.g., health care provider time, laboratory visits) required to deliver intensive treatment, we need a method for selecting ?high-value? patients most likely to benefit safely from intensive SBP treatment. Optimize-SPRINT is a SPRINT ancillary study. Optimize-SPRINT will apply predictive modeling methods to SPRINT to build a clinical decision tool that will be able to select optimal patients (e.g., high absolute benefit and cost-effectiveness) for intensive SBP treatment both at the point of care (for health care providers and patients) and in the population (for private health system and government payers). Our innovative predication modeling methods will identify the highest benefit patients underlying the average summary treatment effect reported from SPRINT, while preserving the advantages of SPRINT's randomized design. We aim to: ? Develop and validate a predictor of clinical benefit with intensive SBP treatment (SPRINT Clinical Benefit Tool) using baseline characteristics. ? Determine cost-effectiveness of intensive versus standard SBP treatment in SPRINT overall and by level of predicted SPRINT clinical benefit, and predict cost-effectiveness of intensive SBP treatment based on baseline characteristics. ? Determine the population health impact of implementing intensive SBP treatment based on predicted SPRINT Clinical Benefit and cost-effectiveness.

This study will inform treatment choice decisions by health care providers and patients, and improve implementation strategies for private and government payers."
"9405389","Early Phase Clinical Research Support Project Summary / Abstract Dana-Farber/Harvard Cancer Center has a proven track record of success in designing, conducting and completing high-impact early phase clinical trials (Pilot, Phase I, Phase I/II). The development and conduct of such trials, which have the potential to transform the care of cancer patients, are challenged by the availability of funds rather than the lack of patients or novel concepts, particularly concepts arising from DF/HCC laboratories. Early Phase Clinical Research Support (EPCRS) funds are used to support research nursing and clinical research coordinator time for approved early phase trials as well as costs associated with the generation of preliminary data through other early phase clinically related activities. Preliminary data may come from pharmacodynamic studies (e.g. measurements of immune perturbation, repeat tumor biopsies, target protein levels, circulating tumor cells or DNA) for important unfunded or under-funded Early Phase trials, with a focus on facilitating the translation of new treatment or biomarker concepts from the laboratory to clinic. By supporting collaborations between laboratory and clinical investigators, EPCRS decreases time from discovery to clinical testing of new agents and approaches thus enabling the conduct of trials that might otherwise either not be conducted or else delayed."
"9432945","The purpose of ?UNC Neuroscience Center Research Cores? (P30 NS045892-14) is to provide NINDS-funded and other NINDS-priority investigators with research capabilities that cannot be supported or sustained by individual laboratories. For the past 13 years, the Cores funded by NS045892 supported almost all NINDS- funded research at the UNC?Chapel Hill School of Medicine. During this time, UNC neuroscientists utilized these Cores to facilitate breakthrough discoveries in NINDS priority areas of neurogenetics, pain, neurodegeneration, and systems neuroscience. For our competitive renewal, we propose two Cores: Microscopy and Bioinformatics. We regularly upgraded our Microscopy Core to take advantage of increased sensitivity, scanning speeds, tiling capabilities, and now super-resolution capabilities. In addition to a Zeiss LSM 780 and other scopes, our Microscopy Core will house a new Zeiss LSM 880 with Airyscan and Fast module. The Core will also provide IT infrastructure and a pipeline for computationally intensive image processing and analysis of light sheet microscopy data. For the Bioinformatics Core, we will fund two bioinformaticians to analyze high-throughput sequencing (HTS) data, including exome and genome sequencing, bulk and single-cell RNA-seq, bulk and single-cell ATAC-seq, Hi-C, and ChIP-seq data. Access to advanced microscopic imaging and bioinformatics support is essential to the performance of cutting- edge research in NINDS-priority areas. With continued support, our NINDS-funded and other NINDS-priority investigators will have their transformative ideas enabled via convenient and affordable access to these key technologies."
"9449013","SUMMARY Personalized medicine, based on the genomic context of a patient?s disease, has become a leading strategy to treat cancer. However, despite the promising results from customized treatments, targeted therapies affect the same signaling pathways in non-cancerous cells, often leading to dose-limiting, ?on-target? toxicities. One such example involves PI3K inhibitors. In head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), the 6th most common cancer worldwide, 34%-56% of tumors harbor mutations or amplifications in PIK3CA, the gene coding for the p110? subunit of PI3K. PI3K? inhibitors carry a significant toxicity profile, however, that limits their therapeutic window, specifically in patients who develop intractable hyperglycemia. Using a targeted drug delivery approach, we have identified a strategy to address this need. The PI developed a new class of nanoparticles targeted to P-selectin which allows the incorporation of a wide variety of therapeutic molecules, including targeted therapies (Shamay, Sci Transl Med 2016). We built a collaborative research team that employed this technology to target tumors expressing endothelial P-selectin, either at baseline or radiation-induced (Mizrachi, Nat Commun 2017). The strategy effected a significantly improved therapeutic index and survival, while minimizing the side effects of targeted therapeutics. Notably, we found that PI3K inhibitors, targeted using our nanoparticle vehicle, resulted in prolonged pS6 inhibition and anti-tumor efficacy, while minimizing acute and chronic effects of hyperglycemia. The objective of this project is to investigate, in the context of HNSCC, the nanoparticle-mediated delivery of PI3K therapies via P-selectin, expressed spontaneously or induced by radiation. This proposal?s goals are to understand the modulation of drug pharmacology, efficacy, toxicities, interactions with HNSCC tumor microenvironment, and the impact of ionizing radiation on these parameters. We plan to pursue the following specific aims: 1) Assess P-selectin-mediated targeting to the tumor microenvironment. We will measure the localization of the nanoparticle and encapsulated drug in the tumor microenvironment from the organ to cellular levels. 2) Enhance nanoparticle localization via radiation-induced endothelial activation. Based on our understanding of radiation-induced expression of P-selectin, we hypothesize that external beam radiation can increase localization of a P-selectin-targeted PI3K inhibitor in disseminated tumors due to the increased availability of the target. 3) Assess efficacy of P-selectin-mediated targeting of PI3K inhibitors. We will assess the relationship between drug delivery mechanism and treatment response. We hypothesize: (i) that the P-selectin-based targeting will improve PI3K inhibitor-mediated efficacy and apoptosis in tumors, (ii) that radiation may increase the relative efficacy of the inhibitor, (iii) that nanoparticle-mediated P-selectin targeting will mitigate PI3K-mediated hyperglycemia, and (iv) that nanoparticle-delivered therapeutic combinations will improve synergistic effects while attenuating toxicities that arise from systemic administration of multiple inhibitors. The outcomes will inform IND and clinical studies."
"9543154","Project Summary/Abstract The Medical Device Innovation Consortium (MDIC), a 501(c)3 Public-Private Partnership will continue its work in bringing together device manufacturers, payers, regulatory agencies, patient groups, physicians, providers and other relevant stakeholders to develop a National Evaluation System for health Technology Coordinating Center (NESTcc). Our approach is to develop a CC that oversees the development and operations of a collective modernized decentralized medical device evidence generation system. We leverage and develop standards for data procurement, signal detection, data processing, and reporting. The CC and governance system will be anchored on diverse stakeholder inclusion, highest ethical standards, patient-centered outcomes, and a business culture of efficiency and accountability to create the foundational principles of trust, transparency, scalability, sustainability and accountability. AIM 1: Launch the inaugural 15-member multi-stakeholder, patient-focused, expert, Governance Committee to provide direction and support for the NESTcc. AIM 2: Continue to establish scope, strategy (decentralization, stakeholder engagement, independence from bias, open science and data sharing, objective prioritization), structure (primary data processes and secondary data and results dissemination), standards (data, methods, reporting, and data access, audit and certification), in a decentralized and federated NEST that will be built around a sustainable business model. AIM 3: Manage NEST demonstration projects that develop, verify and operationalize methods of evidence generation and data use, demonstrate scalability across healthcare systems and device types and manufacturers, and prove out principles of NEST sustainability. AIM 4: Lead state-of-the-art methods development work in critical areas for uses of patient-centered Real World Data and Real World Evidence that are inclusive of the latest technological developments (mHealth etc.) MDIC will continue to establish the NESTcc and create a sustainability plan for continued operations. This will allow the use of real-world data in an efficient manner to accelerate patient access to safe and effective devices quickly identify new safety problems for devices on the market and optimally and appropriately rely on real-world evidence to support product approvals of public health importance, to potentially shift premarket data collection to the postmarket setting, and to meet postmarket data collection commitments through a modern system that leverage electronic health information generated in the clinical and home setting."
"9605872","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)    Highly insoluble urate in the human body leads to both gouty arthritis and renal damage. Humans (and some other species) are uniquely susceptible to urate because we do not synthesize a functional uricase enzyme responsible for converting insoluble urate to more soluble molecules that can be easily excreted from the body. Crystallization during urate build- up causes both severe inflammation in the distal joints and kidney malfunction. Despite its clinical relevance, little is known about how or why the enzymes and transporters that produce and relocate urate in the body evolved in primates. For instance, why do humans not have an active uricase enzyme? Did other components of the urate pathway co-adapt to the loss of functional uricase? We will apply evolutionary analyses to reveal the molecular paths that shaped the evolution of gene families responsible for urate metabolism. Our research focuses on uricase, xanthine oxidoreductase and urate transporter-1 proteins from both modern and ancient organisms. Research will consist of sequencing these genes from modern organisms, inferring and synthesizing ancestral forms of these genes, and performing biochemical and cellular assays in order to reveal how the functions of these proteins have changed during evolutionary history. This multidisciplinary approach will expand our basic understanding of enzyme evolution and metabolic co-adaptation, and allow us to improve uricase therapeutics. Current uricase therapeutics are highly limiting due to poor solubility at plasma pH and strong immunogenicity when presented to human patients. Our preliminary data demonstrate that particular ancient uricases are substantially more soluble in rodent models and less immunogenic when presented to activated human T-cells. We are confident that our novel uricases will lead the development of next-generation therapeutics that treat gout and prevent tumor lysis syndrome."
"9389529","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains a leading cause of morbidity and mortality despite recent advances in pharmacological therapy and acute patient care. Hypertension is the major risk factor for CVD and contributes to 95% of CVD deaths. Salt-sensitive hypertension (SSH) is a major form of human primary hypertension. Central mechanisms involving the lamina terminalis and the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) of the hypothalamus play an important role in the development of SSH. In particular, the angiotensin II (Ang II) type 1 receptor (AT1R) in the PVN mediates increases in sympathetic tone and blood pressure (BP) in response to high salt. The (pro)renin receptor (PRR) is a newly discovered component of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS). Binding of renin or prorenin to the PRR promotes Ang II formation and also activates Ang II- independent mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling. Our preliminary data show that PRR expression levels are elevated in the PVN of hypertensive human subjects; however, the significance of this elevation during hypertension is not known. Our central hypothesis is that hypertensive stimuli increase PRR expression epigenetically in the PVN, which promotes local Ang II formation through activation of prorenin, leading to sympathoexcitation and hypertension. To test this hypothesis, we will apply PVN microinjection and telemetry recording techniques to a mouse model of experimentally SSH. Central to these studies is a PRR conditional knockout mouse strain (Nefh-PRRKO) that we generated by breeding mice expressing Cre recombinase under the control of a neuron-specific neurofilament-H (Nefh) promoter, produced in our laboratory, with PRR-floxed mice. Our objectives are to delineate the functional importance of PRR signaling pathways in the PVN in hypertension and elucidate the epigenetic mechanisms leading to PRR elevation. The following specific aims will be addressed: 1) Test the hypothesis that PRR activation in the PVN mediates the development of hypertension. 2) Test the hypothesis that mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling downstream of the PRR is mandatory for the development of hypertension. 3) Identify the epigenetic mechanisms responsible for elevated PRR expression in the PVN in hypertension. The proposed research will uncover the role of the PVN PRR in hypertension and elucidate the underlying signaling mechanisms. By establishing the importance of the PRR in hypertension and describing novel therapeutic targets, these studies will have a direct impact on cardiovascular biology and may open the door to the development of a new category of antihypertensive drugs."
"9472767","Revised Project Summary.   This project will create two specialty homicide databases in the United States (2000-2018) using resources previously developed. These specialty homicide data will be merged with several unique public data sources that collect information on local crime statistics, other measure of the local environment, and socio-demographic Census data. This specialty database can then be used by the project team and other researchers to test the correlates of certain types of homicides. Homicide is a major source of mortality for adolescent and young adult men and is therefore a major public health issue. This project will also create a GIS database which geo-codes certain types of homicides for other researchers to study the independent effect of these homicides on population health, health disparities, and community well-being."
"9390068","?    DESCRIPTION: Sustained release antiretrovirals (ARVs) for HIV prevention have tremendous potential to reduce rates of new infections, especially among high-risk individuals. Long-acting injectable (LAI) ARVs for PrEP have the potential to address several key barriers inherent in daily oral PrEP, including obviating the need for daily adherence and reducing disclosure concerns. Following successful protection experiments in the macaque model, Phase II trials of the LAI formulation of GSK-744 will begin in 2014, to be followed by Phase III efficacy trials in 2016. The proposed project is based on the premise that identifying key structural, behavioral, and social dynamics of LAI PrEP products and programs can make a significant impact on the future success of the prevention strategy and the speed with which an effective product is rolled out to the highest risk populations. This proposal builds on the investigators' expertise and involvement in both daily oral PrEP trials and LAI PrEP trials in the US to focus on structural, behavioral, and social factors that might inform optimal delivery of long- active ARV formulations for prevention. The project takes a multi-modal approach to identifying relevant healthcare system delivery factors, provider dynamics, and patient preferences that might impact long-acting ARV intervention delivery, including gathering data from three sources: a) patients participating in Phase II and Phase III LAI PrEP trials; b) patients and providers participating in an demonstration-implementation project for oral PrEP; and c) participants and providers from a population most likely to be targeted for LAI PrEP -- young men who have sex with men (YMSM) of color at highest risk for HIV infection. By triangulating data from these three sources, this project will provide vital information to guide both demonstration projects and broader-scale implementation efforts. The specific aims of this project are to: 1) Identify structural, behaviora, and social factors that might influence patient-level factors relevant to implementation of LAI ARV formulations for HIV prevention, such as uptake, persistence, and adherence to follow-up; 2) Identify structural, behavioral and social factors that might influence systems-level factors relevant to implementation of LAI ARV formulations for HIV prevention, such as provider training, protocol development, access, referral, prescription, and monitoring; and 3) Identify specific barriers and facilitators to the implementation of an LAI PrEP HIV prevention program for one of the top priority populations in the US -- highest-risk young men who have sex with men (YMSM). Our proposed deliverables are time-linked to product development milestones and include: 1) recommendations for social and behavioral measures to include in Phase III trials; 2) empirically-based guidelines that can form a blue-print for future demonstration and implementation efforts; and 3) specific recommendations for provider education, clinical guidance, and strategies for optimizing delivery of LAI PrEP to the populations at highest risk for infection. The proposed project will ensure that we are ready to fully realize the potential of new LAI ARV technology, maximizing its ability to make a significant and sustained impact on the epidemic."
"9404996","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Tissue reconstruction and closure of incisions and wounds is pertinent to almost all surgical interventions and traumatic injuries. This project aims to develop a medical sealant that reduces cost, inflammatory response and disease transmission risk, while improving procedural outcomes. Current clinical options suffer from a combination of high cost, poor material properties, and biocompatibility issues. Utilizing a technique called solution blow spinning, polymer fibers can be deposited directly onto any surface. Solution blow spinning has the potential to be a powerful tool in surgery and in biomaterials fabrication. The overall objective of this proposal is to investigate the use of solution blow spun polymer blends of poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) and poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) for use as a surgical sealant in an intestinal anastomosis model. The hypothesis for this research is: solution blow spun PLGA/PEG blends will have advantages over existing sealant strategies, leading to better surgical procedure outcomes. This proposal has been designed to utilize the complementary expertise and facilities at the University of Maryland's Functional Macromolecular Laboratory (UMD) and the Sheikh Zayed Institute for Pediatric Surgical Innovation at Children's National. The Specific Aims of the proposed research are: 1. Adhesive optimization, characterization, and in vitro assessment 2. Polymer functionalization for improved adhesion and in vitro characterization 3. In vivo pre- clinical efficacy and biocompatibility of blow spun polymer sealants in acute and chronic pre-clinical models. This work aims to correlate material properties and deposition conditions to in vitro and in vivo efficacy, and will lead to greater insight into the development of effective surgical materials. Ultimately, successful development of the direct deposition of polymer fiber constructs using solution blow spinning onto any surface could lead to clinically translatable approaches in a diverse variety of surgical applications and in biomaterials fabrication."
"9445258","Abstract Every year about 3 million children in the United States experience significant anxiety prior to surgery and pain following surgery. Not only are these high levels of pain and anxiety emotionally traumatic to the child and family, but also recent data indicate that high levels of anxiety and pain will lead to impaired psychological and clinical recovery following the surgery. Over the past 2 decades, a number of hospital-based interventions have been shown to be effective in the treatment of perioperative anxiety and pain. Unfortunately, use of these interventions has decreased significantly over the past decade, most likely due to both the dramatic shift toward low-cost outpatient surgery and other cost-containment efforts. The recent healthcare reform and poor financial performance by hospitals over the past few years have further accelerated this process. The growing emphasis on health technology provides an opportunity to transform preparation and management of surgery with the use of mobile-based, tailored interventions. Previously, the NICHD awarded the PI of this application a 2-year grant to focus on the development of a web- based tailored intervention (WebTIPS) directed at children age 2-7 years who are undergoing outpatient surgery and their family as well as the involved healthcare providers. To date, the PI has developed the intervention and has demonstrated through a formative evaluation process high usability and likeability of the intervention. The PI also conducted a feasibility RCT and demonstrated, using a usual care control group, that WebTIPS is effective in reduction of preoperative anxiety and postoperative emergence delirium. The purpose of this R01 application is to examine the efficacy of WebTIPS in a large scale clinical trial using an attention control RCT design and validated 30-days outcome measures that are framed within the recently introduced conceptual framework of the ?Triple Aim?. This framework calls for new interventions to be evaluated within the context of: better clinical outcomes, better patient satisfaction and lower resource utilization. We submit that WebTIPS has the potential to transform current perioperative care of millions of children and their families with an enhanced perioperative journey."

"9595015","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Broad, long-term objectives: The research objectives stated herein, and in future studies that would build upon these findings, seek to reveal general scientific principles in the mechanisms that drive spillover and adaption of zoonotic RNA viruses. Significance: RNA viruses contribute to more than half of all human infectious diseases that have originated as zoonoses. Wildlife studies to form a complete understanding of RNA viral- host interactions, especially those that directly test the impact of ecological pressures on viral spread during contact and the first adaptive steps of the virus during spillover can provide important insights. Specifically, the study of the emergence and adaption of hantaviruses can provide critical data for: (1) models for prediction of RNA viral emergence and mitigation; (2) identification of viral and host targets for therapeutic intervention; and (3) a basic understandin of the selective pressures that modulate viral-host interactions and viral genetic variation. Specific aims: We propose field and laboratory studies using South American hantaviruses as a model system to test specific selective pressures to reveal evolutionary mechanisms of RNA virus adaption in reservoir (HR) and spillover host (HS) host systems. The three Aims proposed will: (1) define viral emergence within host reservoirs and sympatric rodent species during extrinsic (environmental) pressure; (2) reveal the relationship of extrinsic (environment & ecological) pressures on preexisting intrahost genetic variation in wild rodent populations; and, (3) define viral fitness, virulence, and genotype during adaptation to new host species in vitro. Research design and methods: The proposed field site for Aim 1 lies in eastern Paraguay, where two hantaviruses co-circulate, and where elevated seroprevalence levels of hantaviruses are associated with anthropogenic alteration of land use. We propose to assess effects of: (1) increased food resources and (2) reduced predation on virus prevalence (Aim 1) and intra- and interhost genetic variation in rodents within native and disturbed forest areas (Aim 2). In Aim 3, we focus on the fitness and virulence of these viruses and the genetic changes that lead to adaptation. Using primary endothelial cell culture-based approaches, we will define the impact of intrinsic (host) selective pressures occurring when a new host species, HS, interacts with virus as it replicates, adapts to a new host host."
"9448930","Abstract  The need for user-friendly and rapid assays for enantiomeric excess (ee) is increasing due to the advent of high-throughput parallel synthesis protocols, directed enzyme evolution, and bead-based catalyst creation. If enabled with rapid protocols for ee, one can envision accommodating such routines involving thousands of reactions. Current HPLC-based protocols for ee analysis cannot accommodate such numbers.  Due to the rapid nature and utility of our assays, we are fortunate that many chemists from around the world have contacted us to exploit our capabilities. However, under the guise of this NIH project, we focus on four collaborations that push various aspects of our methods. With Scott Miller (Yale) we will develop methods for bead-based catalyst screening. With John Hartwig (UC Berkeley) and Adrian Keatinge-Clay we will generate protocols that can readily analyze directed evolution of enzymatic catalysis. With chemists at Merck Rahway, we will facilitate base-metal reaction discovery. In each project, we will use our one-of-a-kind circular dichroism (CD) spectropolarimeter, along with methods of sample triage and standard workflow procedures.  On a more basic science level, but still focused on translation to the synthetic community, we will explore multi-parameter fitting protocols (analogous to linear free energy relationships) that will remove the necessity of having enantioenriched samples to generate calibration curves. Second, for many of the collaborations, we will generate not only ee assays, but also techniques to determine diastereomeric ratio (dr) and reaction yield in a rapid parallel fashion. Further, to facilitate bead-based catalyst discovery, we will use microlithography to generate quartz plates for use in our spectropolarimeter.  Hence, this project is translational while retaining hypothesis driven aspects. Our collaborative efforts will test the utility and generality of our methods, while also highlighting the power of supramolecular chemistry and physical-organic insights, to assist synthetic organic reaction discovery."
"9442553","Francisella tularensis (Ft), Yersinia pestis (Yp), and Bacillus anthracis (Ba) are considered Category A bioweapons due to ease of transmission, low infectious dose and high mortality associated with pneumonic forms of disease, and the fact that all have been intensively studied and developed in bioweapons programs in several countries. There are currently no vaccines against tularemia or plague approved for general human use, rendering mankind at significant risk from the illicit use of Ft and Yp. Our prior studies have shown that a Ft subsp. novicida (Fn) FPI mutant (Fn-iglD) can protect against a pulmonary challenge of Ft subsp. tularensis (Ftt), in both rat and non-human primate (NHP) models of tularemia. This is an extremely promising result, because Fn is naturally avirulent toward humans, and thus a safer basis for a human vaccine. Antibodies against the Yp F1 capsular and LcrV virulence antigens fused into a single polypeptide (F1V) have been shown to be protective against Yp pulmonary challenge in several animal models, including NHP. Moreover, antibodies against the Ba protective antigen (PA) protect against Ba pulmonary challenge. The studies outlined here are designed to optimize the Fn-iglD vaccine platform to provide protection against Yp and Ba by expression of F1V and PA. The Fn-iglD vaccine strain will be engineered to present F1V on its surface and to secrete PA. The efficacy of this vaccine to protect against pulmonary challenge with Ftt and/or Yp, as well as challenge with anthrax lethal toxin (LT) will be measured in the rat model. The result of these studies will be a vaccine with broad efficacy against multiple biothreat agents. The collaborative team at UTSA and UTHSCSA has extensive experience in tularemia, plague, and anthrax vaccine development that will propel the further development of this biothreat vaccine platform. The R21 mechanism is intended to fund ?early and conceptual stages of project development?; upon completion of the experiments outlined in this proposal, this project will be poised for the submission of a well-developed RO1 proposal directed at an effective multivalent biodefense vaccine."
"9391988","ABSTRACT ? Clinical and Translational Research Program (CR)  The objective of the Clinical and Translational Research Program (CR) is to organize and support human  studies conducted by UNC Lineberger faculty. Twenty years ago, with the growth of the research-active  clinical faculty in medical, surgical, radiation, pediatric, and gynecologic oncology, UNC Lineberger made the  decision to perform clinical studies through a Cancer Center CR Program. The clinical research faculty in  oncology was built over this time as the Center played a key role in the recruitment of every UNC oncologist,  selecting physicians with clinical science training and providing all of the startup and infrastructure for their  research. This and the physical proximity to translational scientists (given that the Lineberger building serves  as a virtual bridge between the Cancer Hospital, the Physicians' Office Building, and the basic and public  health sciences) engenders collaborative research across our clinical disease-specific groups. While several  clinician-scientists are appointed or co-appointed in basic or population science programs, the non-breast  cancer clinical trials and human correlative science efforts are concentrated in CR. During the past five years,  the program has incorporated outstanding faculty in drug development, statistical trial design and novel  imaging modalities. The latter has and will continue to grow because of LCCC recruitment, a recent $20M  investment in imaging instrumentation, and the opening of 3 new floors for imaging research in Marsico Hall.  Since the prior funding cycle, the program has two new co- leaders, Claire Dees and Neil Hayes, exceptional  clinician-scientists with complementary research skills. CR's national stature is illustrated by recent success in  obtaining an NCI National Clinical Trials Network (NCTN) Lead Academic Participating Site (LAPS) grant, a tri-  cancer center UM1 award establishing UNC within the Experimental Therapeutics Clinical Trials Network  (ETCTN, with Dees as UNC PI), and one of 5 NCTN Integrated Technology Science Center (ITSC) grants  (with Hayes as PI). CR has two overarching themes: Novel Therapies / Approaches and Tissue-Based  Research. Highlights of program members' research over the past five years include leadership in many high-  impact TCGA analyses, initiation of LCCC1108, Development of a Tumor Molecular Analyses Program and Its  Use to Support Treatment Decisions (NCT01457196)?, also called UNCseq?, which has enrolled over 1,000  patients over the past 2 years. In 2014 LCCC had 198 open therapeutic trials including 124 early phase trials,  24 of which are investigator-initiated trials (IITs). In 2014, 1731 UNC patients were accrued to interventional  trials including 604 to treatment trials, many featuring innovative, correlative science relying on UNC  Lineberger expertise in genomics, proteomics and drug delivery. The addition of affiliate sites raises the totals  to 1990 all interventional and 720 treatment accruals. Over the past 5 years LCCC investigators have  completed 215 early phase clinical trials, including 28 IITs, in addition to a number of consortia and cooperative  group studies. CR has 64 members from 14 departments and had >1,500 publications over the prior funding  period (36% collaborative). In 2014, our program members held 179 grants and $25.2M (total cost) in annual  extramural funding, including 31 grants and $8.4M (total costs) from the NCI. A growing emphasis on  immunotherapy stimulated by faculty recruitment and GMP facility construction are key future directions."
"9449944","Summary Multimodal sensory information is converged through poly-synaptic pathways to the hippocampus to form integrated representations and encode memories of the world, which in turn guide our future behavior through multiple poly-synaptic downstream pathways. It is well known that each of the brain regions in this circuit consists of various neuronal cell types or groups which are distinct in connectivity and functions. Yet we cannot construct a long-range poly-synaptic wring diagram among these specific neuronal groups without efficient tools to continuously track the multiple orders of synaptic connections in a controlled and directed manner. Similarly, it is not clear if the wiring of this pathway is subject to dynamic modifications by learning, memory or brain disorders due to a lack of tools to continuously monitor the neuronal connectivity over time. Here we propose to develop novel methodology to embrace these challenges. In the first part we will modify viral vectors for trans-neuronal tracing which can spread across synapses in a controlled, stepwise manner. With the new tool we will test the hypothesis that distinct neuronal groups in the CA1 or CA3 regions of the hippocampus receive distinct poly-synaptic inputs and send out distinct poly-synaptic outputs. In the second part we will conduct functional imaging and functional manipulations of the specific CA1 or CA3 neuronal groups to test the hypothesis that these neuronal groups, defined by their specific poly-synaptic inputs and/or outputs, receive distinct sensory information and in turn adjust different aspects of behavior. In the third part we will develop novel technology to trace in the same animal the connectivity of neurons of interest at two time points--before and after a learning process--to examine if learning and memory alters neuronal connectivity. Together, these studies will demonstrate whether the distinct neuronal groups at each brain region in the memory circuit are selectively connected with specific neuronal groups in other brain regions to form functional ?channels? which bridge different sensory information to the different aspects of behavior. The novel tools to be developed/optimized in this study will find wide use in neuroscience research helping us to map out the functional network in the brain."
"9464306","Essential tremor (ET) is one of the most common neurological disorders. It is characterized by an action tremor that most commonly affects arms but also other body parts, impacting the life quality of tens of millions of American people. Despite its high prevalence, the underlying neural mechanisms of ET are poorly understood, and as a result, current medications and surgical treatments are of limited effectiveness. The major obstacle to the study of ET etiology is the absence of a genetic animal ET model. The proposed study aims to elucidate the neural mechanisms underlying ET using a novel genetic mouse ET model. Synaptotagmin 2 (Syt2) has been previously characterized as the fast calcium-sensing protein that facilitates synaptic release. Homozygous Syt2 conditional knockout (cKO) mice crossed with parvalbumin (PV)-cre positive mice (referred to as Syt2-PV mice) exhibit specific action tremor behavior and are potentially a great mouse ET model. Combining mouse genetics, mouse behaviors, viral manipulation and circuit tracing techniques, the proposed study will validate Syt2-PV mice as a great ET animal model and utilize Syt2-PV mice to identify the specific brain region, cell type and projection pathway that generate ET-like behavior (aim 1). The identification of neural circuit components underlying ET will allow investigation of the synaptic mechanisms of ET (aim 2), using slice physiology, viral manipulation and optogenetics. These experiments will seek to establish a more faithful mouse ET model, reveal the neural circuit components and synaptic mechanisms underlying ET and shed lights into the therapeutic interventions of ET."
"9397534","PROJECT SUMMARY As a major metabolic organ, the liver catalyzes dietary sugar, primarily encompassing glucose and fructose. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) enhances glycolysis regardless of the oxygen supply. However, whether HCC, in contrast with normal liver tissue, has altered fructose metabolism and, if so, whether this altered carbohydrate metabolism contributes to tumorigenesis are unknown. Our preliminary results revealed that normal hepatocytes, which have high fructose metabolism rates, express the high-activity fructokinase (KHK) isoform KHK- C, a rate-limiting enzyme in fructose metabolism. In contrast, HCC cells have a much lower fructose metabolism rate, and this stitch of KHK isoform expression is mediated by heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein H1/2-dependent alternative splicing of the KHK gene, resulting in a switch from high-activity KHK-C to low-activity KHK-A isoform expression. Importantly, we demonstrated that KHK-A expression is required for production of nucleotides and nucleotide acid derived from glycolysis. We hypothesize that aberrant splicing of KHK coordinates the regulation of fructose metabolism and glycolysis-dependent de novo nucleic acid synthesis to promote HCC development. To test this hypothesis, we will pursue three specific aims: 1) determine the role of alternative splicing of KHK in the regulation of HCC metabolism, 2) determine the role of alternative KHK splicing and the significance of KHK-A? mediated PRPS1 phosphorylation in hepatocellular tumor growth, and 3) determine the role of fructose metabolism in hepatocellular tumor growth. The proposed research is significant because it may lead to pharmaceutical approaches to interrupting HCC metabolism by blocking the function of KHK-A. In turn, this would improve the efficacy of HCC treatment."

Understand the status of exclusive breastfeeding and other infant feeding practices from the  perspective of mothers in a 6-cluster area of Belagavi District, Karnataka, India,  ? Assess the acceptability of the use of peer counselors and their effect on exclusive breastfeeding  rates and other breastfeeding practices,  ? Assess institutional needs for creating a successful peer counseling model to optimize breastfeeding practices,  ? Understand the barriers as well as facilitating factors associated with recruiting and retaining  community-based peer counselors,  ? Facilitate the design of an effective and culturally-appropriate training curriculum for mothers with  breastfeeding experience to prepare them to counsel and support pregnant women and  breastfeeding mothers during the BEST4Baby pilot-testing phase,  ? Generate information to determine how a mobile technology (mHealth) platform can support peer  counselors and promote their effectiveness and retention over an extended period of time. Based upon the exploratory research, technological expertise will be applied to the design and implementation of a breastfeeding training program for peer counselors, which will include multimedia content to aid counselors in educating and supporting mothers to increase their commitment to exclusively breastfeed their infants to six months and adopt other recommended breastfeeding practices. Orientation to the use of mobile health (mHealth) technology will be integrated into peer counseling training of 24 mothers with breastfeeding experience?or 4 from each of the 6 clusters participating in BEST4Baby. The mothers recruited for training must consent to training, serving as counselors, and assessing usability and acceptability of the BEST4Baby mHealth platform. After completing training, each counselor will be assigned to 5 pregnant women who consent to receiving breastfeeding counseling. Two counseling sessions will be scheduled prior to delivery, and then peer counselors will visit mothers post-delivery in their homes. Research staff will also visit mothers to collect data on breastfeeding practices and to obtain feedback on the benefit of BEST4Baby and mHealth tools used during the course of the project. A comparison group of mothers will be utilized to evaluate the influence of peer counseling on breastfeeding practices."

"9393541","Project Summary: Behavioral Inflexibility and Dorsal Striatal AMPA Receptors (BIDSAR) Alcohol use problems may emerge from behavioral inflexibility, including difficulties processing information about conflicting goals such as seeking alcohol's rewarding effects while avoiding its aversive ones, and/or shifts towards habitual, stimulus-bound drinking. However, unknown is the extent to which behavioral inflexibility predisposes an individual toward risky alcohol drinking, if chronic voluntary alcohol drinking mediates shifts in behavioral flexibility, or by what neural mechanisms behavioral flexibility is mediated. In short, there remains a critical gap in our understanding of the genetic and neural mechanisms underlying inflexible alcohol drinking. There is a critical need to understand the mechanisms underlying both an innate proclivity towards, and the effects of alcohol on, behavioral inflexibility, with a long-term goal of developing novel treatments for excessive drinking behavior. The objectives of this application are to (1) to determine whether innate differences in inflexible behavior generalize to consumption of other reinforcers (e.g. saccharin) and to other cognitive domains (i.e., attentional set-shifting); (2) assess whether long-term alcohol drinking to intoxication in susceptible populations facilitates inflexible and compulsive-like behavior; and (3) determine whether either innate or acquired inflexible behavior is associated with altered AMPA receptor expression and pharmacology in the dorsolateral versus dorsomedial striatum, consistent with the idea of heightened glutamatergic tone. We will achieve the objectives by exploring these relationships using genetic mouse models of excessive alcohol drinking. Our central hypothesis is that cognitive inflexibility (compulsivity) is both an endophenotype and consequence of chronic alcohol consumption, mediated by altered prefrontal cortical glutamatergic input to the dorsal striatum."
"9427316","Project Summary: This proposal outlines the vision of a systematic, ongoing effort directed towards the fundamental understanding of catalytic asymmetric reactions and its application to the development of more selective catalysts and discovery of novel concepts in asymmetric organocatalysis. Our research program, since its inception in September 2013, has accumulated a vast body of mechanistic information including experimental kinetic isotope effect (KIE) studies and transition state analysis of several important organocatalytic reactions with a special emphasis on proline-enamine catalysis. This proposal describes our current efforts in utilizing this information to design more selective catalysts and to develop novel concepts in enamine catalysis.  These efforts have met with some initial success and we have successfully developed a general strategy to obtain synthetically useful enantiodivergence ? access to both antipodes of a target molecule using the same enantiomer of chiral catalyst ? in proline-enamine catalysis. In this proposal, we are extending the application of this concept to develop two novel concepts in proline-enamine catalysis ? chemodivergent and diastereodivergent enamine catalysis. The latter concept, diastereodivergent catalysis, provides access to complementary diastereomers of a chiral molecule in high enantiopurity using the same chiral catalyst ? a phenomenon that has no precedent in asymmetric catalysis.  Finally, we are seeking to expand the physical organic toolkit available to the synthetic organic community by developing probes for the rapid elucidation of reaction mechanisms. We have developed a novel methodology ? intramolecular designed reactant (IDR) ? for the rapid determination of 13C KIEs at natural abundance. We propose to apply the IDR method to conduct a high-throughput mechanistic study of several palladium catalyzed cross-coupling reactions. Cross-coupling reactions are the most-utilized carbon-carbon bond-forming strategy in medicinal chemistry and the mechanistic information gleaned from this study is expected to have a significant impact on process development in the pharmaceutical industry."
"9427404","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Heart failure (HF) is characterized by markedly elevated levels of catecholamines that bind to adrenergic receptors (ARs) in the heart. The toxic effects of excessive beta (?)-AR stimulation are well described, and drugs that block ?-ARs are cornerstones of contemporary HF therapy. Cardiac alpha (?)1-ARs have received less attention, however data from cell and animal studies indicate that they protect against the development of HF. There are two ?1-AR subtypes in the heart: ?1A, and ?1B. The ?1B mediates cardiac hypertrophy induced by non-selective ?1-AR agonists like phenylephrine. Activation of the ?1A protects against cardiomyocyte death and increases contractility in the failing heart, though the mechanisms underlying these adaptive effects are poorly understood. We recently showed that an oral selective ?1A agonist drug, dabuzalgron, preserves ATP content and mitochondrial function in mouse HF models. These protective effects were abrogated by trametinib, a MEK-ERK1/2 inhibitor used to treat melanoma. Our recent preliminary data expand upon these novel findings by suggesting that ?1A activation may improve cardiac energetics through increased glucose utilization, coupling augmented glycolysis to glucose oxidation through enhanced oxidative phosphorylation. The overarching hypothesis of this proposal is that ?1A-ARs protect the failing heart through an ERK1/2-mediated increase in glucose metabolism that counteracts the deleterious metabolic effects of chronic ?1 hyperstimulation in HF. In Aim 1, we will use a cardiomyocyte-specific ?1A-AR knockout mouse in two mouse models of pathological hypertrophy and HF to confirm the requirement of cardiomyocyte ?1As for the cardioprotective effects of dabuzalgron. In Aim 2, we will find if ?1A-AR activation enhances glucose utilization to provide energy for the failing heart using transverse aortic constriction in vivo coupled with in vitro studies using selective pharmacology and gene silencing to identify key metabolic processes and signaling pathways affected by ?1A activation. Aim 3 will define the role of ERK1/2 activation in ?1A-mediated metabolic cardioprotection, using both trametinib and genetic modification of MEK-ERK axis to provide new insights on the role of ERK1/2 signaling in the regulation of glucose metabolism and mitochondrial function. Collectively the proposed experiments will expand our understanding of cardiac ?1A-ARs and challenge the prevailing paradigm that chronic catecholamine surge exerts uniformly deleterious effects in the failing heart."

"9472216","PROJECT SUMMARY  Our published work and preliminary data using mouse models and in vitro cell cultures show that extracellular matrix (ECM) molecules such as versican accumulate in lungs following exposure to viruses and bacteria. The creation of a specialized versican-enriched ECM coincides with invasion and retention of leukocytes in lungs during the immune response to influenza virus. We have found that two cellular sources synthesize versican in response to Toll-like receptor (TLR) agonists: macrophages and fibroblasts. Studies identify two distinct signaling pathways directing versican synthesis in these two cell types - the ?-catenin/T-cell factor (TCF) pathway in stromal cells such as smooth muscle cells and fibroblasts and the TLR/Trif/Type I interferon (IFN) receptor pathway in macrophages. However, the cellular specificity of these signaling pathways is not known. Using two novel strains of genetically engineered mice in which the versican gene is deleted in a cell- and time-specific manner, our published and preliminary data shows that versican has a dramatic effect on leukocyte phenotype. When treated with polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid (poly(I:C)), mice with a global deficiency in versican have decreased recovery of leukocytes in bronchoalveolar (BAL) fluid suggesting that versican is pro-inflammatory and required for leukocyte migration into lungs. In contrast, mice lacking versican in macrophages have increased recovery of leukocytes in BAL fluid suggesting that macrophage-derived versican is anti- inflammatory and suppresses leukocyte migration into lungs. Both strains of versican-deficient mice had significantly decreased recovery of Type I IFNs and IL-10 in lung tissue or BAL fluid when compared to controls. Our in vitro studies attribute this to decreased production of these anti-inflammatory cytokines by versican-deficient macrophages. The differences observed in these novel versican-deficient mice are the basis of our central hypothesis that the formation of a versican-enriched ECM by macrophages and stromal cells provides critical contextual cues and extracellular-control of the innate immune response to viral lung infection. We propose three aims to test this hypothesis. Aim 1 defines the role of versican derived from macrophages and/or Type I IFN signaling in providing extracellular-control of the innate immune response in lungs of mice exposed to influenza virus. Aim 2 determines if stromal cells and/or ?- catenin/TCF signaling promote the generation of a versican-enriched ECM that provides fine-control of the innate immune response to influenza virus. Aim 3 identifies the mechanisms and signaling pathways whereby macrophage- versus fibroblast-derived versican provide contextual extracellular-control of the innate immune response. Understanding the contextual settings in which versican provides fine-control of the innate immune response to influenza virus is critical for the design of therapeutic strategies for improving the immune response to viral lung infection."
"9447537","Whole genome sequencing has provided unprecedented information about human genetic variation. There is growing awareness that interactions between variants play a major role in determining phenotype. Yet, we lack an understanding of how genetic variation translates into genetic interactions that affect an individual. A key to solving this problem requires an understanding of the rules governing genetic networks. During our current funding period, we used the Synthetic Genetic Array method, which we developed to automate yeast genetics, to complete a reference genetic interaction map for yeast. This network provides a global view of the functional organization of a cell and reveals a hierarchical model of cell function. The reference network enabled our efforts to explore biological network dynamics in response to environmental and genetic perturbations, including genetic suppression and triple mutant interactions. Our work underscores the potential of genetic interactions to impact the inference of phenotype from genome sequence information. Although gene editing approaches offer the promise to accelerate similar studies in other systems, many types of important genetic interactions remain relatively unexplored, and can only be mapped on a genome-scale in yeast. Thus, we propose continued analysis of complex genetic interaction networks in yeast, which we will use as a model for designing informative experiments to explore genetic interactions in human cells. Aim 1: An iterative computational-experimental approach to map a condition-specific genetic network. We will test specific gene-condition combinations expected to yield many genetic interactions. Based on preliminary analyses, we estimate that a systematic analysis of condition-specific interactions will expand the global genetic interaction network by ~3-fold, providing a resource to explore the influence of environment on genetic network wiring. Aim 2: Large-scale mapping of suppressor genetic networks in yeast. We will map extragenic and dosage suppression genetic interaction networks for yeast essential genes. This analysis will uncover novel relationships between genes and provide a template for similar studies in more complex systems. Aim 3: Elucidating the landscape and principles of complex genetic interactions. We will map Complex HaploInsufficiency (CHI) interactions between heterozygous alleles of essential genes in a diploid strain and also test the potential of genetic interactions involving naturally occurring genetic variants to modify phenotype. These studies will offer insights into how ploidy and natural variation shape the penetrance of mutant phenotypes and complex traits. Aim 4: Translating insights from the global yeast genetic interaction network to human cells. Applying our knowledge of the yeast reference network, we will select and screen an informative set of query gene mutants to efficiently map a scaffold genetic network for a human cell. This network will identify genetic network properties that are generally conserved and provide a resource for annotating human gene function."
"9342597","Project Summary TB remains one of the leading causes of death from infectious disease worldwide, and treatment adherence a persistent challenge. This is particularly pressing in high-burden, low- resource settings such as Cambodia, where approximately two-thirds of people carry the TB bacterium, one of the highest rates in the world. We propose to develop and pilot a novel smartphone-based intervention to improve TB treatment adherence, integrating video-enabled Directly Observed Therapy (VDOT) with transfers of mobile money and phone ownership to compliant patients. This intervention aims to directly address two of the key barriers to TB treatment adherence in low resource settings where DOT is costly or impractical. First, the video component has the potential to substitute direct in-person observation with time-stamped videos of patients taking their medication. Second, our proposed intervention incorporates incentives to patients for treatment adherence and equipment preservation in the form of mobile money and eventual phone ownership upon treatment completion. In partnership with the National Tuberculosis Program (NTP), we will assess the feasibility of this intervention and of a future randomized study in two districts of Cambodia. First, we will extend and adapt an existing platform for video-enabled medication monitoring (Mobile Interactive Supervised Therapy (MIST)) to incorporate mobile cash payments conditional upon compliance. We then identify and address outstanding technical and usability issues with the platform by conducting an initial 1-month test of the intervention with 10 TB patients. Finally, we conduct a 6-month demonstration study among 50 households in our study locations to assess the acceptability, implementation, and potential for scale up of the intervention. We also aim to assess the practicalities and challenges of a future randomized controlled effectiveness and cost-effectiveness trial. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to examine a mHealth intervention for TB that integrates both adherence monitoring and patient incentives into a single platform. The results will be of immediate relevance to the NTP as well as other TB control programs seeking new alternatives to improving adherence, especially where traditional DOT may be infeasible or costly. These results will also be of interest outside the area of TB where adherence to treatment is critical, such as HIV. More generally, the study will provide key insights into mHealth programs in a setting relevant to other developing countries. This project will involve building new capacity in Cambodia for behavioral research, mHealth, and communications through training to the study personnel and general training on conducting TB and/or mHealth research to study partners and other stakeholders in the country."
"9447400","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT. Bacteria on and within the body (the microbiota) influence human physiology, therapeutic responses, and dis- ease states. Cyclomodulins are bacterial toxins and effectors that modulate eukaryotic cell cycle progression, proliferation, differentiation, or apoptosis, and may be genotoxic. Certain strains of E. coli in the human gut contain a gene cluster (referred to as ?clb?) that encodes small molecule cyclomodulins known as precolibac- tins. Evidence suggests precolibactins are prodrugs that are converted to cytotoxins (colibactins) by a dedi- cated peptidase (colibactin peptidase, ClbP). clb+ E. coli induce DNA double-strand breaks in mammalian cells in vitro and in vivo, suggesting these molecules are trafficked (by an unknown mechanism) to eukaryotic cells, and initiate tumor formation in colitis-susceptible mice treated with azoxymethane. Several independent stud- ies have demonstrated that the clb cluster is epidemiologically correlated with colorectal cancer in humans. As colibactins are unstable, all isolation efforts have employed clbP deletion strains to facilitate accumulation of the more stable precolibactins. We developed convergent high-yielding syntheses of linear precolibactin bio- synthetic precursors and showed they transform to unsaturated imines after ClbP deacylation; these imines alkylate DNA by nucleotide addition to an electrophilic cyclopropane. Structure?function studies established distinct DNA recognition and prodrug domains. Of equal significance, our data indicate that the use of clbP deletion strains results in the production of alternative, non-genotoxic structures, such as precolibactins A?C. Precolibactin-886 is the most complex clb isolate known and is the first that contains an ?-aminomalonate resi- due, which is believed to be important for cytopathic effects. We hypothesize that the unusual macrocyclic structure of precolibactin-886 also derives from employment of a clbP deletion strain. To test this we will pre- pare precolibactin-886 and key synthetic derivatives/biosynthetic precursors and elucidate their chemistry. We will determine if deacylation of the linear precursor to precolibactin-886 leads to production of similar electro- philic imines. We will evaluate the potency, cell cycle effects, and DNA-damaging abilities of synthetic colibac- tins and controls in a zebrafish model. Using enzymology, genetic deletion studies, and X-ray crystallography, we will elucidate the roles of the enzymes ClbL, ClbO, ClbM and ClbS, which are encoded in the clb cluster but do not have well-defined functional roles. The latter two enzymes phenotypically contribute to colibactin re- sistance and their study may illuminate methods to inhibit clb+ E. coli-associated colorectal cancer. This grant employs four investigators with non-overlapping expertise in chemical synthesis, natural products biosynthesis and isolation, preclinical studies of clb+ E. coli in vitro and in vivo, and enzymology and protein crystallography. This work will establish a mechanistic model that accounts for all known precolibactins, define the molecular mechanisms by which certain E. coli induce carcinogenesis, and inform strategies to inhibit clb+ E. coli-driven tumorigenesis. These studies will provide insights into the functional roles of non-proteiogenic cyclomodulins."
"9457971","Neural tube closure is a morphogenetic process that involves complex behaviors of polarized neural plate cells. With more than 200 genes implicated in this process in genetic models, neural tube abnormalities are among the most common human birth defects. Nevertheless, mechanisms of neural tube closure remain poorly understood and the available vertebrate models are limited. Our preliminary experiments have identified a unique polarization of several proteins in the plane of the Xenopus neural plate and demonstrated that this polarity requires the functions of both planar cell polarity (PCP) and apical-basal polarity proteins. The proposed studies will carry out live imaging of the neural plate using a novel fluorescent sensor. New molecules that physically associate with the PCP complex will be identified using a novel proximity- and complementation- based biotinylation approach combined with mass spectrometry. The involvement of the apical-basal polarity proteins in PCP signaling during neural tube closure will also be evaluated. Xenopus embryos are easily accessible at any developmental stage and are uniquely suited for these studies, allowing rapid analysis of protein localization and function through a combination of biochemical, embryological and cell biological approaches. These experiments will shed light on basic signaling mechanisms that underlie normal development of the central nervous system. The proposed studies are highly relevant to human health, because misregulation of these signaling pathways leads to brain and neural tube defects and a variety of neurological disorders.    .  "
"9435987","PROJECT SUMMARY This R21 project will use potent chemical inhibitors of bacterial quorum sensing to develop new materials and explore innovative approaches to the attenuation of bacterial infections in skin wounds. These objectives will be accomplished by the pursuit of two focused and integrated Aims: (1) development of polymer-coated wound dressings that promote the local release of synthetic quorum sensing inhibitors that target virulence factor and biofilm production in the common and notorious human pathogen Staphylococcus aureus, and (2) characterization of the ability of these dressings to attenuate bacterial load and promote the healing and repair of wounds using a mouse model of bacterial skin infection.  Bacterial infections pose persistent and costly threats in myriad health settings. These problems are now urgent because the current arsenal of conventional antibiotics has been almost completely depleted by the emergence of drug-resistant bacterial strains. The importance of the growing resistance threat and its potential impacts on society are nearly impossible to overstate; new approaches to treat bacterial infections and move beyond conventional strategies are desperately needed.  One promising alternative approach to prevent unwanted bacterial colonization in wounds that does not involve killing bacterial cells is to target non-essential pathways that control virulence in bacteria. Such non- bactericidal `anti-virulence' strategies can circumvent resistance and represent a potential paradigm shift for the clearance of biofilms and the treatment of infections. Bacterial cell-cell signaling (or `quorum sensing', QS) is one of the most attractive targets in the emerging anti-virulence field because it controls many of the primary mechanisms that underlie bacterial infection, including toxin production, adhesion, and biofilm formation. Our laboratories have developed several of the most potent chemical inhibitors of QS currently known. These compounds and their ability to strongly inhibit virulence in S. aureus are the focus of this proposal.  The proposed work is based on two broad propositions: (i) that inhibition of QS in bacteria can prevent undesirable behaviors that lead to infection in vivo, and (ii) that inhibition of QS in surface-associated bacteria can be accomplished most effectively through the design of surfaces and interfaces containing agents that target QS pathways. This innovative and cross-disciplinary research seeks to explore these new ideas and test hypotheses that will create a foundation for the development of anti-virulence treatments in the specific and clinically relevant?and increasingly urgent?context of preventing infections in skin wounds through the design of novel wound dressings that prevent bacterial QS and virulence. Our research plan unites a team of four established and actively collaborating investigators at the UW?Madison with a unique mix of expertise in quorum sensing, chemical biology, materials engineering, microbial pathogenesis, and clinical wound care to demonstrate the feasibility of this new, materials-focused anti-virulence approach."
"9329162","Project Summary/Abstract. Breast cancer is among the most frequently diagnosed cancers. It accounts for nearly a quarter of all cancer diagnoses worldwide every year. Metastasis typically occurs early in breast cancer, and it is the most significant cause of mortality. The current treatment and staging for breast cancer are based on the TNM prognostic markers: tumor size (T), presence of lymph nodes (N), and metastasis (M). Increasing evidence indicates that breast cancer development is correlated with significant changes in the extracellular matrix (ECM). An important change is the excess accumulation and deposition of collagen, termed desmoplasia, which results in increased linearity of fibrous protein in the tumor-associated ECM, as well as stiffening of the matrix. These changes are highly correlated with and, based on increasing evidence, causative of metastasis. A key player that is responsible for this restructuring of the ECM is matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), a zinc-dependent family of proteases which break down proteins in the ECM. There have been efforts to therapeutically combat this propensity for metastasis through the use of MMP inhibitors as a form of cancer therapy. One highly promising investigational drug is Batimastat, an MMP inhibitor which progressed through Phases I, II, and III clinical trials, before being eliminated due to poor solubility and problematic routes of administration. The key limiting factor of Batimastat was in delivery. To improve this, this study proposes to develop a water-soluble polymer as a vehicle for delivery of Batimastat. N- (2-hydroxypropyl)methacrylamide (HPMA) copolymers are water soluble, non-toxic, non-immunogenic, multifunctional polymer platforms, which have been studied extensively for drug delivery. Collagen mimetic peptide (CMP) is collagen-resembling peptide that was rationally designed to bind to denatured collagen in the same hallmark triple helical form as endogenous collagen. As collagen is the most abundant protein in mammals and is the most concentrated molecule in the ECM, the presence of excessive denatured collagen in the remodeling tumor-associated ECM provides an excellent opportunity for tumor-selective targeting. We hypothesize that through the incorporation of CMP as a targeting moiety in the side chains of HPMA copolymers, we can improve the delivery and efficacy of the therapeutic, Batimastat as well as imaging agents. To test this hypothesis the following Specific Aims will be pursued:  1) to design and characterize a multifunctional HPMA-CMP conjugate with the ability to bind to tumor-associated ECM; 2) to characterize the ability of the polymer conjugate systems to modulate tumor cell migration and invasion, [collagen remodeling, and MMP activity] in vitro; and 3) to evaluate the ability of the polymer conjugate to accumulate in tumor regions and affect tumor growth [and metastasis].  "
"9395941","Project Summary/Abstract  Preventing the onset of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and its recurrence, and reducing the morbidity and mortality associated with AMI, remain of significant public health and clinical concern. Monitoring contemporary trends in AMI incidence, treatment, and in-hospital and long-term outcomes is of considerable importance given periodic national updates of treatment guidelines, emphasis on reducing hospital readmissions, and revised definitions and classifications of AMI. Continuously supported by the NHLBI, we have conducted more than 35 years of population-based surveillance of AMI incidence and attack rates, hospital management practices, and the in-hospital and long-term prognosis associated with AMI among residents of central MA hospitalized at all central MA medical centers. We have a highly experienced team of cardiologists, epidemiologists, clinical informatics, and health services researchers who will build on multi- decade long trends (1975-2011) in our principal study endpoints examined previously in this study to the two new study years of patients hospitalized with AMI at all central MA medical centers in 2014 and 2017.  To sustain our efforts into the era of electronic medical records (EMRs), and after implementation of the ICD-10 system in 2015, we will develop a new automated AMI surveillance system that efficiently utilizes EMRs by taking advantage of state-of-art natural language processing (NLP) methods that will be compatible with ICD-10 (Aim 1). We will use the new NLP method to streamline traditional chart review-based collection of socio-demographic, clinical, treatment, and hospital and post-discharge outcomes data in patients hospitalized with AMI at all 11 central MA medical centers in 2014 and 2017. The data extracted from NLP-streamlined chart reviews will be used to validate and refine the NLP system. Issues related to changes from ICD-9 to ICD- 10 will be carefully addressed. The new NLP-enriched EMR-based surveillance system will eventually be implemented in all participating central MA hospitals. Using the NLP-enriched and EMR-based surveillance data, we will monitor the contemporary clinical epidemiology of AMI, and out-of-hospital deaths due to coronary disease, and changing landscape, over a more than 40 year period (1975-2017) (Aim 2).  The new EMR-based and NLP-enriched system will enhance the population-based surveillance of acute coronary disease. This new system will be cost-effective, more efficient and near-real time, have greater accuracy and precision, and can be readily updated to accommodate changes in information technologies and broadly applicable to other hospital systems. It will support our continued efforts to provide unique community- based observational data on several populations that are often excluded from clinical trials, and that are increasing in numbers, namely the elderly and patients with multiple morbidities. Furthermore, it will generate critical data to inform more national clinical guidelines on the enhanced prevention and management of AMI. If successful, the system can serve as a model and be implemented statewide in MA and elsewhere in the US."

"9444006","PROJECT SUMMARY Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a growing public health burden. The syndrome itself is occurring in more diverse contexts and the long-term sequelae of AKI include chronic kidney disease (CKD). More than ever then, AKI research must identify candidate pathways that can be assessed and targeted in humans. In the first four years of this award, the applicant's laboratory has found that the mitochondrial biogenesis regulator, PGC1? (PPAR?-coactivator-1?), confers robust resistance to simple, common acute stressors that culminate in AKI such as acute systemic inflammation and renal ischemia. Moreover, we have observed that renal PGC1? expression is markedly suppressed in human AKI. Finally, we have implicated a novel downstream effector pathway for PGC1??biosynthesis of the energy carrier nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+). Based upon these results, we hypothesize that the PGC1?-NAD+ pathway may be a critical determinant of metabolic defense against diverse renal tubular insults. To test this concept in ways that advance both our fundamental understanding of this emerging candidate and that catalyze translational efforts, we propose three parallel aims: (1) identify when in the CKD-AKI spectrum tubular PGC1? induction is most beneficial; (2) critically evaluate the role of NAD+ biosynthetic pathways in experimental AKI downstream of PGC1?; and (3) dissect the relative contributions of mitochondrial biogenesis versus NAD+ biosynthesis in the metabolic protection conferred by PGC1?. To accomplish this, our team is composed of individuals possessing complementary expertise with a proven track record of collaborating to investigate metabolism in AKI. We have developed a suite of tools ranging from metabolomics and lipidomics applications to gene-edited cells to function- ultrastructure analysis of mitochondria. The output from the proposed aims will advance our understanding of how renal tubular metabolism bridges CKD and AKI; identify specific contexts in which PGC1?-NAD+ should be pursued clinically; and deepen our fundamental understanding of PGC1? and NAD+ in renal health. In concert with a growing number of outstanding groups investigating renal metabolism, it is our hope that the proposed studies help expand this new frontier in renal biology."
"9454687","Project Summary Chlamydia trachomatis is the leading cause of preventable blindness and the most commonly acquired sexually transmitted infection of bacterial origin, with over 4 million new cases in the United States and an estimated 92 million cases worldwide each year. Importantly, there are substantial ethnic and gender disparities associated with chlamydial infection, where the majority of undiagnosed chronic infections are subclinical in women and linked to an increased risk for developing pelvic inflammatory disease, infertility, cervical cancer, stillbirths, and premature deliveries. While the precise mechanisms responsible for these clinical manifestations remain largely undetermined, we do know that Chlamydial infections require establishment and maintenance of a unique intracellular replication niche for completion of a complex biphasic lifecycle. However, many of the host factors involved in this process are not known and this gap in our knowledge limits our understanding of the C. trachomatis lifecycle and pathogenesis associated Chlamydia infections. The long-term objective of our research is to determine the molecular mechanisms that Chlamydia employs to establish an infection. We hypothesize that C. trachomatis relies on a subset of genes in the human genome for successful completion of the bacterial lifecycle and knock-outs of these host genes will perturb the Chlamydia lifecycle and prevent cell death. To test this hypothesis, we are using a CRISPR-Cas9 based high- throughput genome wide knock-out screen to identify novel genes and microRNAs that are resistant to C. trachomatis infection. Additionally, we will generate individual gene knock-outs to investigate the role of specific host genes in the cytoskeleton and vesicle transport pathways. Specifically, this proposal aims to (1) identify mutations in genes or microRNAs that are essential for the C. trachomatis lifecycle (2) knockout individual genes in specific host pathways and determine their role in C. trachomatis entry and inclusion germination and maturation.  "
"9392931","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project involves the development of new statistical methodologies and computational tools for network-based integrative analysis of epigenetic risk factors of cardiovascular diseases (CVD). While the advent of omics data from new technologies has facilitated the study of epigenetic factors, existing methodologies often do not account for complexities of biological data  such as correlations due to interactions of genes/proteins as part of biological pathways  and fail to e?ciently integrate diverse omics data sets  for instance genetic variation, DNA methylation and gene expression. The methodologies proposed in this project, and the software tools that will be developed to implement them, address these shortcomings, and facilitate further research by the biomedical community to gain a better understanding of the underlying biology of CVD, and to develop new diagnostic biomarkers and potential targets for therapies. The proposed methodologies are motivated by the study of epigenetic data from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA), and include (i) a network-based pathway enrichment analysis method that incorporates available knowledge of interactions among genes and proteins while complementing and re?ning such information (Aim 1A), as well as its extension for analysis of multiple types of omics data (Aim 1B), and (ii) an integrative analysis framework to identify associations among gene expression levels and DNA methylation (Aim 2A) and identify common epigenetic factors of multiple CVD phenotypes through integrated analysis of DNA methylation and mRNA expression data (Aim 2B). We will develop e?cient and user-friendly software tools for the proposed methods (Aim 3), which will be made freely available to the public after extensive tests using both simulated data, as well as real data from MESA."
"9457793","During the previous two decades it has become apparent that genomic rearrangements are often the type of mutation that underlies neurological disease. This is so not only for neurodevelopmental disorders such as intellectual disability (ID) and different recognizable patterns of human malformation (e.g., Potocki-Lupski syndrome), but also for late-onset adult neurological disorders such as Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease. Moreover, genomic rearrangement can often underlie complex traits and sporadic diseases such as Parkinson?s, Alzheimer?s disease and other neurodegenerative processes. Contrary to prior interpretations, experimental evaluation of disease associated genomic rearrangements has often documented that they can be much more complex than anticipated. Complexities can occur at individual loci and give specific patterns for complex genomic rearrangements (CGR) as observed on genome-wide array CGH; such as duplication-normal-duplication (DUP-NML-DUP), or a triplication embedded within duplications (DUP-TRP-DUP). Furthermore, complexities can occur on a genomic level leading to complex chromosomal rearrangements (CCR) and the phenomena of chromothripsis observed both in cancer and neurodevelopmental disorders, as well as an unusual experimentally observed pattern of multiple de novo copy number variants (CNVs) spread apparently randomly throughout the genome. The elucidation of mechanisms that can generate such complexities is an emerging field. We propose to further characterize CGR that have been found in association with neurological disease. Specifically, we will investigate: 1) CGRs that consists of: i) a DUP-NML-DUP pattern and ii) a pattern of a triplicated segment in inverse orientation embedded within a duplicated segment of the genome (DUP-TRP/INV-DUP); these are newly observed types of CGR with one proposed mechanism elucidated in our previous application; 2) The mechanism for recurrent triplications; 3) Elucidate the underlying molecular characteristics and breakpoint junctions of CGR that are accompanied by long genomic stretches of absence of heterozygosity (AOH), and resulting in both genomic (CGR) and genetic (AOH) alterations; 4) Alu-Alu rearrangements and their role in genomic instability and disease and 5) We will attempt to isolate a gene important to the phenomena of multiple de novo CNV seemingly randomly distributed throughout the genome. The experimental approaches to be utilized to accomplish each one of these specific aims are now within our reach. These studies predominately require genomic approaches that enable genomewide assays of variation such as array comparative genomic hybridization, genomewide SNP chips, whole exome sequencing (WES), whole genome sequencing (WGS), and other mapping and molecular approaches for the delineation of specific breakpoint junctions. It is anticipated these studies will characterize these novel types of rearrangements and lend further insight into basic molecular mutational mechanisms driving gene and genome evolution and that can cause the myriad of neurological diseases."
"9419512","Understanding human brain function requires knowledge of its connectivity: how one structure causally influences other components of the network. A wide range of neurological and psychiatric disorders prominently involve dysfunction of connectivity, including neurodegenerative diseases, autism, and mood disorders. Yet current methods provide only indirect measures of connectivity, and none can directly test how one brain structure causally influences another at the level of the whole brain. A unique opportunity to obtain such measures in the human brain comes from using experimental manipulation of activation through direct electrical stimulation, coupled with the whole-brain field-of-view of fMRI (es-fMRI). Our group has obtained IRB approval, and obtained strong initial data of concurrent es-fMRI in a series of 20 neurosurgical patients over the past two years. Here we intend to leverage this unique approach to the application of important open research questions in emotion, and to dissemination of protocols to a wider community of possible performance sites through this U01 mechanism.  Three Aims progress through initial validation and quantification of the approach, mapping of brain networks involved in emotion processing (with a focus on the amygdala and medial prefrontal cortex), and convergent measures with ECoG and rs-fMRI. These Aims offer a mix of immediate implementation based on strong pilot data, more exploratory implementation during the grant, strong validation components, and future planning.  The research focus of all Aims is on how emotion is caused by activity in brain networks. This is the topic with the strongest link to readily accessible brain structures for electrical stimulation in neurosurgical epilepsy patients (amygdala and prefrontal cortex). The work would have immediate implications for deep brain stimulation to treat diseases like depression, and long-term implications for eventually mapping out the effective functional connectome of the human brain. We will aim to provide the research community with short, feasible protocols that could be adopted by many other sites in a concerted effort to map effective connectivity in the human brain, eventually accumulating a database for understanding how individual differences in emotion, in health and disease, arise from differences in network connectivity."
"9456065","Most antibiotics and chemotherapies target the products of essential genes that are necessary for proliferation or survival of cells in vitro. The effectiveness of such therapeutics also depends on the repertoire or drug- resistance genes that help defend against such assaults. To improve the effectiveness of current antibiotics, and to facilitate development of novel antibiotics, high-throughput methods for comprehensively identifying essential genes and genes affecting drug susceptibility are sorely needed. Here we will implement a new method termed HIP (Hermes Insertion Profiling) in the pathogenic yeast Candida glabrata and a new deep- sequencing pipeline termed QIseq to identify all essential genes in this organism as well as all of non-essential genes that influence resistance to several classes of antifungals in clinical use today.  HIP involves mobilizing a marked transposon to insert almost randomly at very high density throughout the small genome of C. glabrata, and then deep-sequencing millions of independent insertion events in the resulting pool of mutants. Essential genes will be identified based on their inability to tolerate insertions within the coding sequences, and this first complete essentialome in a pathogenic fungus will be compared to those of the model yeasts in order to reveal the core essential genes and potentially to improve essentialome predictions in other pathogens. Similarly, we will exploit HIP and QIseq to quantify enrichment/depletion of insertions in pools exposed to moderate concentrations of three clinical antifungals: amphotericin B, fluconazole, and caspofungin. Such insertions will define all the non-essential genes that regulate drug resistance, and modifications of this experiment will be used to define all genes that regulate the epi-genetic phenomena of drug tolerance and persistence, where small numbers of ?persister? cells become transiently refractory to the drugs even though they do not contain drug-resistance mutations.  This project provides immediate insights into how C. glabrata generates and maintains resistance to, and tolerance of, several classes of clinical antifungals. It produces a very useful pool of bar-coded C. glabrata mutant strains to the research community for broader genome-wide studies of gene functions, and it serves as a model for how new drug targets and drug resistance mechanisms can be comprehensively evaluated in other pathogenic eukaryotes at low cost and high speed and accuracy using HIP-like approaches."
"9464602","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The candidate is an MD/PhD trained clinical ophthalmologist with the career goal of investigating the mechanisms of glaucoma pathogenesis, using oculocerebrorenal syndrome of Lowe as a model disease. The career development plan will be jointly mentored by Dr. Jeffrey Travers and Dr. Zhong-yin Zhang, whose laboratories focus on the molecular signaling pathways of lipid mediators and protein phosphatases. The candidate's long-term aim is to understand the roles of phosphoinositide signaling in the eye, specifically regarding aqueous production and filtration, in order to identif novel targets for therapeutic development. Glaucoma is the second leading cause of irreversible blindness in the world and is the leading cause of blindness in African Americans. Elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) has been known to be a strong risk factor and remains the only target for intervention, but the mechanisms causing elevated IOP remain poorly understood. We have found evidence of an important regulator of vesicular trafficking in the eye that may control IOP. Lowe syndrome (OCRL1) is an X-linked disorder characterized by glaucoma and congenital cataracts, as well as brain and kidney diseases. The OCRL1 protein is an inositol polyphosphate 5-phosphatase that controls the levels of phosphoinositides, which in turn are important in vesicular trafficking. We propose to study the mechanism of OCRL1-mediated vesicular transport by examining the interaction between OCRL1 and kinesin motor proteins. Our aims are to (1) characterize the distribution and expression of OCRL1 in human and mouse eyes, (2) determine whether OCRL1 mediates vesicular trafficking along microtubules by binding to kinesin family members, and (3) determine whether OCRL1 is required for the trafficking of apical membrane proteins in trabecular meshwork epithelium. The funding of this proposal will ultimately facilitate the discovery of new glaucoma therapies that can reduce the burden of blindness."

"9402568","Summary A common theme in bacterial evolution is how the acquisition of antibiotic resistance can rapidly change the epidemiologic landscape of major human pathogens. Carbapenem Resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (CRKp), first documented in 1996, is now epidemic in New York City (NYC) hospitals and is reported globally. CRKp infections often result in poor therapeutic indices; thus curbing the incidence of CRKp infections is now a national priority. Currently, three overlapping CRKp epidemics with three different classes of carbapenemases are spreading in different continents. Accelerating these epidemics is the ability of carbapenemase genes, harbored on conjugative plasmids, to spread across the Enterobacteriaceae family. A critical, poorly understood aspect of the CRKp epidemic is the relative contribution of plasmid-mediated transfer and clonal dissemination to driving the regional and global epidemiology. Previously, we used whole genome sequencing (WGS) to dissect the molecular epidemiology and evolution of the main US epidemic CRKp sequence type (ST) 258. Interrogating strains and resistance harboring plasmids within our network of NYC hospitals we found that the majority of ST258 CRKp strains harbor one of three common plasmids carrying a particular class of carbapenemase enzyme, KPC. These data suggest the spread of CRKp is likely the consequence of plasmid-mediated gene transfer and subsequent clonal spread. We therefore hypothesize that this epidemic is primarily due to transmission of resistance harboring plasmids uniquely adapted to specific host genetic backgrounds. In Aim 1, we expand our NYC network to include a large US consortium and to examine the genomic epidemiology of CRKp strains and plasmids across the US. Aim 2 builds on the insights and techniques developed in our previous studies to interrogate the global epidemiology of CRKp via a large clinical isolate collection from over 62 countries, with the goal of constructing a phylogeographic map of strains, plasmids and carbapenemase genes. In this Aim we will also directly test the basis of CRKp strain-plasmid association by comparative transmission efficiency studies of different carbapenemase gene-harboring plasmids into diverse strain backgrounds. Using robust CRKp genomic data obtained in Aims 1 and 2, we will develop a rapid molecular detection assay to identify and track CRKp strains and plasmids in clinical settings. Aim 3 will characterize non-carbapenemase factors that contribute to high-level carbapenemase resistance in CRKp isolates, such as mutations in outer membrane proteins, which result in very poor clinical outcomes. Based on this characterization, some of these highly carbapenemase resistant strains will be selected to build a new, well-curated panel of strains for testing novel antibiotic agents. Taken together, ours is an innovative approach with the potential to make a substantial impact in the field of CRKp epidemiology, develop critically needed diagnostic platforms, and explore efficacy of novel antibiotics against these organisms."
"9430648","7. PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT  Staphylococcus aureus is a major bacterial pathogen worldwide, and this is compounded by multiple drug resistance including methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) and vancomycin-intermediate S. aureus (VISA). We have discovered that when S. aureus is grown ex vivo in serum and likely in vivo in an infection, straight-chain unsaturated fatty acids (SCUFAs) are incorporated directly into cellular lipids and become major components of the total fatty acids. SCUFAs are not found in cells grown in laboratory media, in which the fatty acids are a mixture of straight-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and branched-chain fatty acids (BCFAs). Bacterial glycerolipid fatty acid composition is a major determinant of membrane biophysical properties, which thus impacts all aspects of cell physiology including susceptibility to membrane active antimicrobials, pathogenesis, and response to environmental stress. It is shocking to realize that all aspects of S. aureus membrane structure and function studied thus far have been done with cells with the ?wrong? fatty acid composition, i.e., they lack SCUFAs as a major component. Although both BCFAs and SCUFAs increase membrane fluidity, indications are they are not exactly functionally equivalent in membrane structure or in conferring fitness on an organism. Furthermore, laboratory media-grown cells present the wrong face to the host in that incorporation of SCUFAs into glycolipids and lipoproteins increases their reactivity with host defence systems. We propose to redress these severe omissions in staphylococcal biology. We will carry out a refined and detailed investigation of how the presence of SCUFAs in the growth environment impacts the fatty acid composition of individual classes of lipid- containing molecules in the cell, i.e. phospholipids, glycolipids, lipoteichoic acid, lipoproteins, and carotenoids. The biophysical and functional aspects of the membranes with extreme differences in the proportions of BCFAs, SCFAs, and SCUFAs, including cell physiology, membrane fluidity, antimicrobial susceptibility and virulence factor expression will be determined. This will show if the alterations of the membrane lipid profile following growth in serum is a key adaptation in S. aureus in response to host-pathogen interactions. Cells grown in serum, Tryptic Soy broth (TSB) and Mueller-Hinton (MH) medium, and cells with fatty acid compositions manipulated by feeding fatty acid auxotrophs different mixtures of fatty acids, will be studied. Detailed biophysical investigations of membranes with or without SCUFAs will be carried out through studies of the temperature-dependent fluidity of total lipids and individual lipid components. Membrane integrity will be probed through studies of peptide interactions with total lipids and individual lipid classes. The carotenoid staphyloxanthin is a further unique membrane lipid component. A carotenoid-deficient mutant will be used to study the impact of this component on membrane structure and function. Because the cytoplasmic membrane is such a critical aspect of cell function these studies are important to the fundamental biology of S. aureus including antibiotic susceptibility, pathogenesis and overall physiology. It may be possible through supplementation of medium to devise culture conditions that yield a membrane composition that resembles that of cells growing in vivo. These considerations are important in antibiotic susceptibility testing, expression of virulence factors, and attempts to develop inhibitors of fatty acid biosynthesis as antistaphylococcal drugs."
"9390056","The lipin proteins (lipin-1, lipin-2, and lipin-3) are critical for triacylglycerol (TAG) metabolism, a key theme of  our Program Project. Lipin proteins have phosphatidate phosphatase (PAP) enzyme activity and catalyze  the penultimate step in TAG synthesis, converting phosphatidic acid to diacylglycerol. Lipins also interact  with transcriptional regulators to modulate gene expression. Lipin-1 expression levels and activity influence  adiposity, insulin resistance, liver and muscle lipid homeostasis, energy expenditure, and peripheral nerve  myelination. The physiological roles of lipin-2 and lipin-3 are much less well characterized. Human lipin-2  deficiency causes Majeed Syndrome, which is distinguished by bone inflammation and anemia. The  mechanism for this disease is unknown and highlights the need for a better understanding ofthe physiology  and pathophysiology of lipin proteins. Virtually nothing is known about the physiological role of lipin-3.  Our proposal is based on three discoveries that we have made regarding the biological roles of lipin-2  and iipin-3 using our lipin-deficient mouse models. The first is that lipin-2 knockout mice have abnormalities  in the bone growth plate, and lipin-2 is localized to cells that populate the growth plate?the chondrocytes. In  Aim 1 we will define the role of lipin-2 in chondrocyte differentiation and determine the mechanisms  underlying bone abnormalities associated with lipin-2 deficiency. The findings may provide fresh insights  into the pathogenesis of bone abnormalities in Majeed syndrome. A second discovery is that adipose tissue  PAP activity and TAG accumulation are determined not only by lipin-1, but also by lipin-3. We have mapped  a physical interaction between lipin-1 and lipin-3, suggesting a mechanistic basis forthe requirement of both  lipins in adipose tissue. Our findings regarding the role of lipin-3?and the interaction between lipin-1 and  lipin-3?in adipocyte function are likely to be relevant to human adipose tissue biology, since the balance  between lipin-1 and lipin-3 may influence the differential susceptibility of lipin-1-deficient mice and humans  to overt lipodystrophy. A third discovery is that lipin-2 and lipin-3 each contribute to PAP activity in the small  intestine, and that the loss of both proteins leads to a dramatic accumulation of cytosolic TAG droplets in  enterocytes. We propose that lipin-2 and lipin-3 PAP activities are important for intestinal lipid homeostasis  and chylomicron assembly. The implication of lipins in this process is novel given that intestinal TAG  synthesis has been attributed primarily to the monoacylglycerol pathway. Our studies will shed new light on a  fundamental process of lipid metabolism in the small intestine.  ."
"9433964","The development of nanotechnology has allowed the identification of unique properties in nanomaterials that have, in turn, led to the development of commercial applications in many fields, such as chemical catalysis, semiconductors, water purification, cosmetics, microelectrodes, biosensors, the food industry, biomedicine, etc. In 2009, developers generated more than $1 billion from the sale of nanomaterials, and the market for nanotechnology is expected to grow to 75.8 billion by 2020 with several hundreds of thousands of jobs. Thus the levels of human exposure to anthropogenic nanoparticles will substantially increase. As an important transition metal, nickel nanoparticles (Nano-Ni) have wide ranging applications in the fields of batteries, electrical conductors, permanent magnets, magnetic fluids, magnetic recording media, solar energy absorption, fuel cell electrodes, and catalysts. In addition, due to structural and inherent chemical and physical properties, nickel alloy nanomaterials have received special interest in biomedical applications. In this proposal, we selected Nano-Ni as a model metal nanoparticle because of its wide industrial interest and biological and medical applications. Based on our preliminary data, our working hypothesis is that Nano-Ni can cause oxidative stress and DNA damage in lung epithelial cells, and long-term exposure to Nano- Ni results in DNA repair deficiency by down-regulating Rad52, increased genomic instability and cell transformation through up-regulation of miR-210, and nuclear accumulation of the hypoxia inducible factor 1? (HIF-1?). The following two Specific Aims will be pursued. Specific Aim 1. Examine the role of HIF-1? pathway in Nano-Ni-induced genotoxic effects in vitro and in vivo. We will first examine whether exposure to Nano-Ni will induce DNA damage in normal human lung epithelial cells BEAS-2B and in mice by measuring the phosphorylation level of ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) at Ser1981 and p53 at Ser15, and expression level of Rad52 and phosphorylated histone H2AX (?-H2AX). We will then investigate the role of HIF-1? in Nano-Ni-induced DNA damage by using: (1) HIF-1? - specific siRNA; and (2) HIF-1? knock-out cells. Specific Aim 2. Examine whether exposure to Nano-Ni causes down-regulation of Rad52 through up-regulation of miR-210 induced by HIF-1? activation during Nano-Ni-induced cell transformation. We will first determine whether long-term exposure to low doses of Nano-Ni will induce normal BEAS-2B cells to transform. We will then measure the levels of Rad52, miR-210 and HIF-1? in cells with long-term exposure to Nano-Ni and in Nano-Ni-transformed cells. Finally, we will explore the role of Rad52 in Nano-Ni-induced cell transformation through overexpression or knockout of Rad52."
"9395916","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Local recurrence is the most common pattern of failure for retroperitoneal, abdominal, and pelvic (RAP) sarcomas. Despite a macroscopically complete resection, surgical margins are typically positive due to large tumor size and anatomic complexity, resulting in 5-year local recurrence rates of 50% to 90%. Mortality is due to locoregional rather than distant failure and therefore, strategies to improve survival must reduce locoregional failure rates. Trials evaluating perioperative and/or intraoperative external beam radiation therapy, single-dose hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy, and systemic chemotherapy have failed to demonstrate benefit.  We recently developed a novel, flexible, tissue-conforming, biocompatible polymer film (Biomacromolecules, 2012, 13, 406-411) that can be placed intraoperatively over the entire tumor resection bed to slowly elute the chemotherapeutic drug paclitaxel (Pax-films) locally and kill residual tumor cells. When utilized in our mouse surgical model of recurrent sarcoma, Pax-films markedly increased local tissue paclitaxel levels, avoided systemic toxicity, reduced locoregional recurrence rates, and improved overall survival without healing complications (Annals of Surgical Oncology, 2012, 19, 199-206.). Utilizing an organotypic in vitro culture method that preserves tumor architecture and microenvironment, enables pharmacodynamics profiling of a given tumor's response to chemotherapeutic drug delivery providing the means to predict which specific histologies, or potentially which specific patients, benefit the most from Pax-films. Lastly, we have established mouse xenograft models capable of rapid local tumor recurrence after surgery which allows us to evaluate efficacy of anti-neoplastic therapy against a variety of human sarcomas in vivo. With these skill sets and resources in hand, we can now address the following three specific aims:  SPECIFIC AIM 1: Investigate efficacy and pharmacodynamic profiling of the Pax-film response against resected patient-derived sarcomas in vitro.  SPECIFIC AIM 2: Define the pharmacodynamic profile and mechanism of action of Pax-films in the prevention of locoregional recurrence of human sarcoma xenografts in vivo.  SPECIFIC AIM 3: Assess safety, feasibility, and perioperative morbidity of Pax-film implantation in a pre- clinical large animal model of surgical resection. Successful completion of this proposal will answer the hypothesis that prolonged exposure to paclitaxel-loaded polymer films will: 1) reduce tumor cell viability in vitro for human-derived sarcoma cell lines and patient tumor samples as assessed via organotypic culture; 2) reduce locoregional recurrence rates and improve survival in mouse surgical models of human sarcoma; and 3) prove to be safe and feasible for locoregional drug delivery, achieving high local tissue drug levels with low systemic delivery, when implanted in a large animal along tissue planes and vital structures commonly exposed during clinical extirpative sarcoma surgery."
"9593197","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) play a central role in regulation of cell response during development and homeostasis, and dysregulation contributes to diseases such as cancer. RTK-targeted therapies have been applied successfully in cancer treatment though with limited effectiveness as activity of non-targeted RTKs can enable cells to become resistant. While redundant signaling is now appreciated as a common mechanism of acquired and innate resistance, the exact signaling that is essential to resistance, and whether it is conserved or varies across cancer contexts, has not been addressed. RTKs lead to a common set of downstream signals, but in vastly different quantitative combinations, and differ in their ability to confer resistance in a context-dependent manner. A fundamental, rigorous understanding of resistance is necessary if we are to develop better therapies to overcome this redundancy. TAM receptors (Tyro3, AXL, MerTK) are a family of RTKs that have attracted interest for their widespread roles in tumor resistance and metastasis. However, while the ligands for these receptors have been identified, we lack even a basic understanding of the contexts that lead to activation of these receptors. RTKs work by auto- and trans-phosphorylation, recruiting adapter proteins, and then phosphorylating those adapters and other associated proteins. Systems biology has concentrated on easily measurable factors such as phosphorylation, but comparisons of signaling between receptors are not easily accomplished, as phosphosites between receptors do not readily equate. The amount of receptor-bound adapter molecules is one quantity that should be directly comparable however. Thus, I plan to develop techniques to measure RTK interaction quantitatively and across the multiple potential interactions within a cell simultaneously with the intention of more completely capturing signaling from these receptors. I will use these techniques combined with quantitative modeling to examine interactions during receptor activation and understand how different RTKs can provide redundant signaling leading to targeted cancer treatment resistance. These resistance and interaction models will then be applied to more specifically understand resistance conferred by the TAM family of RTKs. Through development of mechanistic models for ligand-dependent and independent signaling, linked to adapter interaction, downstream signaling, and tumor cell resistance, I plan to develop an integrative understanding of resistance. This will provide necessary information to develop therapies bypassing this problem."
"9457871","PROJECT SUMMARY (ABSTRACT) Risk for ischemic stroke, a leading cause of death and disability in the United States, is primarily assessed to- day by degree of carotid artery stenosis. However, insufficiencies in stenosis degree as a biomarker for stroke risk commonly lead to unnecessary surgical revascularization by carotid endarterectomy (CEA). It is estimated that, among patients with clinical indication for CEA, only 1 out of 14 with 50-69% stenosis experiencing neuro- logical symptoms, and 1 out of 22 asymptomatic patients with 70-99% stenosis, would have had a stroke if CEA was not performed. There exists an urgent yet unmet need to improve differentiation of patients at low risk of embolic stroke from those in need of CEA to prevent it. This need could be met by a technology capable of noninvasively interrogating biomarkers that have been established to confer increased risk of stroke and transient ischemic attack (TIA), namely: thin or ruptured fibrous cap (TRFC), lipid-rich necrotic core (LRNC), and intraplaque hemorrhage (IPH). These carotid plaque features have been delineated by MRI and associ- ated with current and future risk for stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) in several clinical studies; how- ever, MRI is prohibitively expensive for screening and routine monitoring. The lack of a low-cost, noninvasive imaging method that reliably delineates carotid plaque structure and composition and is suitable for wide- spread diagnostic application represents a major gap in improving stroke risk stratification. To fill this gap, our group has spent the first five-year funding cycle of this grant award developing Acoustic Radiation Force Im- pulse (ARFI) ultrasound for delineating the structure and composition of human carotid atherosclerotic plaque, in vivo, with spatially-matched histological validation. Our research has demonstrated that ARFI delineates LRNC/IPH, collagen/calcium deposits, and TRFC in human carotid plaque, in vivo, with TRFC thickness meas- urement as low as 0.49 mm - the mean thickness associated with carotid plaque rupture. The success of our investigations thus far motivates further advancement of ARFI technology to enhance carotid plaque imaging. Specifically, we will exploit ARFI Variance of Acceleration (VoA) imaging22,23, higher center frequencies24, and harmonic imaging25 to newly enable separate discrimination of TRFC, LRNC, and IPH and accurate feature size measurement. We will determine the association between advanced ARFI?s plaque characterization and recent history of ipsilateral stroke or TIA. We hypothesize that advanced transcutaneous ARFI ultrasound de- lineates TRFC, LRNC, and IPH in human carotid atherosclerotic plaques in vivo, and these ARFI-derived plaque features are associated with recent ipsilateral stroke or TIA. The research team is exceptionally well prepared to pursue this work; the PI and all Co-Is previously collaborated on the successful completion of the first five years of this research program, and skilled support for the design and execution of clinical trials is available through the North Carolina Translational and Clinical Sciences (NCTraCS) Institute at UNC Chapel Hill."
"9390404","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Of the estimated 24 million people in the United States with COPD, approximately 25% have or will suffer from the unintentional and pathologic loss of skeletal muscle. These 6 million people will have an approximate 50% reduction in median survival. There are several possible causes of this process including systemic inflammation, disuse atrophy, hormonal insufficiency, hypoxemia, and oxidative stress. The multitude of these conditions collectively results in the cachexia observed in smokers and it is not unexpected for more than one to be present in a given individual. Because of the differential loss of fat free mass (FFM) and the reciprocal tendency for increased adiposity with age, a simple measure such as body mass index (BMI) may be insensitive to these processes until it is at its latter stages when it is less amenable or even refractory to therapeutic intervention. The challenge to clinicians and investigators is not the detection of an individual's degree of oxidative stress or systemic inflammation but rather the detection and diagnosis of cachexia itself. The purpose of this investigation is to validate and apply a computed tomographic based measure of body composition in smokers. We will do this by refining and applying our image based assessment of the pectoralis and erector spine muscles and adjacent subcutaneous fat as well as diaphragm muscle thickness in two large observational studies, COPDGene and ECLIPSE. We will begin in Aim 1 by exploring the association of these measures with mortality and other clinically relevant metrics of disease severity in the Round 1 COPDGene Study. We will then replicate and expand upon these observations using both cross sectional and longitudinal data obtained in ECLIPSE. Finally, in Aim 3 we will examine the change in CT measures of body composition and change in lung function and other clinically relevant measures of disease. We will do this by completing our analysis of all of the Round 2 COPDGene CT scans"
"9435575","PROJECT SUMMARY This study will leverage nationally-representative survey data to determine the current prevalence, severity, geographic distribution, and determinants of food allergy among the US population. In 2016, we collaborated with an expert panel of primary care physicians, allergists, epidemiologists, biostatisticians and health services researchers to develop and administer comprehensive population-based cross-sectional surveys assessing the current prevalence of food allergy among 80,000 U.S. households. The surveys were administered by the independent research organization NORC at the University of Chicago, and population-weighted results are now available for analysis. This study will analyze and interpret these nationally-representative survey data in order to determine the prevalence, distribution, and determinants of food allergy and the development of tolerance to previously allergenic foods among adults and children in the US, and to assess recent trends in childhood food allergy prevalence since our prior 2009-2010 pediatric prevalence survey. These data will be the first to characterize food allergy among adults, including adult-onset food allergy, and the development of tolerance. These data will also provide a much-needed update to our landmark 2009-2010 study of childhood food allergy, the estimates from which remain the most widely cited estimates of childhood food allergy prevalence in the US. Furthermore these data will permit a comprehensive look into current FA diagnosis and management trends, and will determine the degree to which current clinical and self-management practices are consistent with those recommended by the 2010 NIAID-sponsored Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Management of Food Allergy. Findings from the present study will increase our understanding of the interplay of socio-environmental and individual factors on the development of new-onset food allergy and the development of tolerance among adults and children. By characterizing current FA, we will inform the context of future food allergy research regarding diagnosis, management, and treatment of this rapidly emerging, multi-generational health concern."
"9582212","Abstract Th17 cells are an Interleukin-17-producing subset of CD4+ T effector cells that are centrally implicated in many human inflammatory and autoimmune diseases, from inflammatory bowel disease to multiple sclerosis. The retinoid orphan receptor gamma t (ROR?t), a nuclear hormone receptor, programs Th17 cell development and function. With the ultimate goal of modulating inflammatory T cells in disease settings, we undertook chemical and genetic screening to identify ROR?t target genes that drive human Th17 cell function. Intriguingly, our results implicated a group of genes in a novel pathway that would link lipid metabolism, ROR?t activity and Th17 cell functions. We will thus test the hypothesis that Th17 cell function is controlled in large part, by ROR?t target genes, via lipid droplets (LDs) (cellular organelles associated with lipid metabolism). We will take the following approaches: First, we will determine if LD- related genes ? specifically, HILPDA and BNIP3 ? are necessary, sufficient and specific regulators of human Th17 cell functions. Second, we will elucidate the molecular mechanisms by which LDs modulate Th17 cell differentiation. Third, using autoimmune disease models in mice, we will determine the physiological significance of LDs in inflammation and autoimmune pathologies. Our results may shed a light on novel lipid-regulatory mechanisms that control Th17 cell responses in inflammatory diseases."
"9431959","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  My long-term career goal is to be an independent investigator with a multidisciplinary program of research in the treatment of obesity. As a clinical psychologist, my prior training has focused on identifying and reducing harmful psychosocial consequences of obesity, including weight-based stigma. However, in order to achieve my goal of conducting research to reduce adverse health consequences and improve quality of life for persons with obesity, it is essential that I have additional training in the clinical treatment of obesity. The K23 award would enable me to devote 90% of my effort to filling critical gaps in my training and to conducting research that will facilitate my becoming an independent clinical investigator in obesity.  The proposed training plan will support my career goals by addressing three fundamental areas: 1) conducting clinical trials in obesity treatment; 2) assessing and promoting study participants' engagement in physical activity; and 3) understanding biological mechanisms that increase risk for cardiometabolic disease. I will obtain training in these areas by: receiving guidance from expert mentors in the field; completing coursework and attending seminars; and engaging in related research activities. This training plan will give me the knowledge and skills needed to prepare a successful R01 application by the end of the K23 award period.  My research project will complement my training objectives while also building upon my prior stigma- related research efforts. In a randomized controlled trial, I will test the effects on long-term weight loss of a novel clinical intervention designed to help individuals with obesity cope with weight stigma, combined with . standard behavioral weight loss. I believe that reducing WBI will improve long-term weight loss by increasing physical activity, a behavior consistently associated with greater long-term weight loss. This research project will also incorporate assessments of cardiometabolic risk to determine whether reducing WBI helps to improve physical health. The proposed research project could have significant clinical implications for enhancing the treatment of obesity and reducing the negative effects of weight stigma.  The environment at the Center for Weight and Eating Disorders at the University of Pennsylvania (Penn) is ideal for supporting my training and research needs. The Center will provide practical resources for data management and participant recruitment, assessment, and treatment. I will receive mentorship primarily from Dr. Thomas Wadden, the Center's director. Additional mentorship and research resources will be provided by Dr. John Jakicic (director of the Physical Activity and Weight Management Center at the University of Pittsburgh School of Education) and Dr. Daniel Rader (director of the Penn Preventive Cardiovascular Program). Outside of these specific centers, I will have access to several other academic programs at Penn to support my training needs, including the Institute for Diabetes, Metabolism, and Obesity. Penn provides a remarkably rich environment that will enable me to achieve my research and training goals."
"9405406","Kidney Cancer Program Project Summary / Abstract The Kidney Cancer Program performs innovative basic research into the molecular basis of kidney tumors. Scientific efforts within the current funding period have focused on identifying meaningful biomarkers for early detection and prognosis, underlying mechanisms of disease biology and novel therapeutic targets for the various kidney cancer populations, and improved preclinical models for preliminary validation of these findings. The specific aims of the program are to 1) Identify and validate novel targets in kidney cancer, and establish pre-clinical models for testing new agents; 2) Identify molecular and biologic predictors of response and toxicity to therapy; 3) Leverage Program and SPORE infrastructure to facilitate drug and device development; and 4) Identify factors that increase the risk, predict the development and recurrence of kidney cancer.

Of these 36% were inter-institutional, 14% were intra-programmatic, and 51% were inter-programmatic collaborations between two or more DF/HCC members. Overall, when counted once, 27% of DF/HCC publications were inter-programmatic collaborations."
"9573577","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): It is increasingly clear that olfactory perception is impaired in a wide variety of neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders. However, this growing clinical appreciation for the human sense of smell is offset by a poor scientific understanding at the physiological level. Indeed, much of our basic knowledge about the human olfactory system is inferred from studies in rodents and insects, but whether the cortical computations established in animals are relevant for humans is largely unknown. The major aim of this research project is to elucidate the spatiotemporal mechanisms of odor processing in the human olfactory system. In collaboration with the Comprehensive Epilepsy Center and Functional Neurosurgery teams at Northwestern, we will record odor-evoked patterns of electroencephalographic (EEG) activity directly from the human brain in patients with medically intractable seizures. The highly accurate placement of high-density invasive electrodes around the medial temporal and orbital frontal lobes during standard surgical exploration offers a unique window into the functional anatomy of the olfactory system with unparalleled temporal and spatial resolution. Studies are designed to compare odor-evoked oscillatory activity profiles in the olfactory bulb, olfactory (piriform) cortex, and orbitofrontal cortex, and to understand how these different brain regions interact to support olfactory categorical perception and coding. Work proposed here will yield a more comprehensive basic research understanding of human olfaction, particularly with regard to its temporal dynamics, and will provide a direct link to non human animal studies. From a clinical translational perspective, this project may help in diagnosis and prediction of functional outcome in epilepsy patients, and open up new avenues for monitoring disease onset and progression in other neurological disorders involving the sense of smell."
"9473326","ABSTRACT Antibody-antigen complex (IC) deposition within and outside blood vessels that is associated with neutrophil infiltration is pathogenic in many human immune mediated disorders. The objective of this competing renewal remains the delineation of receptors and intracellular signals that regulate IC-mediated neutrophil recruitment and associated organ damage. Fc?Rs have emerged as key mediators of inflammation in a range of IgG-mediated diseases from glomerulonephritis, arthritis and vasculitis to fatal anaphylaxis. Our studies in mice expressing the uniquely human activating Fc?R, Fc?RIIA selectively on neutrophils of mice lacking their own activating Fc?Rs have shown that Fc?RIIA is a key molecular link between IC deposition, neutrophil influx and tissue damage. As such, this receptor must be tightly controlled. In the last funding cycle, we identified two major pathways regulating Fc?RIIA function. First, surprisingly, the neutrophil CD18 integrin Mac-1, known to promote inflammation, inhibited Fc?RIIA mediated neutrophil capture by immobilized ICs under flow by cis interaction of its ligand binding domain with Fc?RIIA's ectodomain. This may have relevance for human disease as the non-synonymous Mac-1 small nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) R77H associated with lupus and systemic sclerosis risk impaired Mac-1's affinity for its known ligand, complement C3 and for Fc?RIIA. Second, we showed that Fc?RIIA signaling to Abl-1/Src kinase and subsequent F-actin polymerization was required for rapid neutrophil arrest on IgG and the strengthening of Fc?RIIA-IgG bonds under shear flow in vitro. Accordingly, in vivo, 2- photon intravital microscopy (IVM) of the kidney revealed that in glomerular capillaries, intravascular ICs directly captured neutrophils via their Fc?RIIA without evidence of prior neutrophil rolling. This recruitment was inhibited by a Abl/Src inhibitor suggesting that it is an active process requiring intracellular signaling. Two related questions arise from these findings that are the basis of the current proposal. First, how is the interaction of Fc?RIIA-Mac-1 ectodomains regulated, does R77H perturb this interaction and how does this lateral interaction inhibit Fc?RIIA affinity for ligand? Second, what Fc?RIIA mediated intracellular pathways are engaged to promote capture of circulating neutrophils by deposited IgG? These questions will be addressed using knock-out mice, IVM and models of disease combined with fluorescent lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) analysis, biochemical assays and in vitro assays that mimic neutrophil recruitment to IC-coated endothelial cells under flow. We anticipate that the information provided by the proposed studies will give insights into how Fc?RIIA mediated neutrophil recruitment is regulated and thus identify important therapeutic leads for the prevention of Fc?RIIA mediated neutrophil accumulation, potentially one of the earliest events in IgG mediated inflammatory disorders."
"9421103","Summary Acute ischemic injury, such as myocardial infarction (MI), is a major contributor toward the development of heart failure (HF), a progressive disease affecting millions of patients and costing billions of dollars annually. Leukocytes are rapidly recruited to the heart after ischemic injury where they regulate a wide variety of responses including cardiomyocyte survival, fibrosis, infarct stabilization and revascularization. Initially, inflammatory and phagocytic leukocytes are recruited to degrade dead cells and damaged matrix, followed by reparative leukocytes to stabilize the myocardium and resolve the injury. As such, modulation of the balance between leukocyte-dependent inflammation and resolution processes within the heart after ischemic injury is at the forefront of recent efforts to diminish prolonged adverse post-ischemic remodeling and persistent inflammation associated with chronic HF. The sympathetic nervous system can influence leukocyte processes, in part via stimulation of ?-adrenergic receptor (?AR) signaling, and becomes activated after cardiac injury. We recently showed that, compared to normal mice, chimeric mice lacking ?2AR expression in cells of hematopoietic origin (?2ARKO BMT mice) displayed 100% mortality via cardiac rupture following MI, which was associated with decreased leukocyte recruitment to the heart. Mechanistically, we have demonstrated that ?2AR acts in a signaling pathway-biased manner to regulate leukocyte responses to cardiac injury via G protein coupled receptor kinase (GRK)/?-arrestin (?arr)-dependent ?2AR signaling. Arising from this work are questions related to the extent to which ?2AR signaling regulates inflammatory versus reparative leukocyte populations and their survival following cardiac injury, and whether biased ?2AR signaling offers a novel approach to regulate these processes to improve cardiac remodeling outcomes. Further, since ?2AR deletion negatively regulates leukocyte functions, the possibility exists that clinically used ?-blockers may similarly impact leukocyte responsiveness to ischemic injury and survival within the injured myocardium. Therefore, we aim to 1) define the ?2AR expression-dependent alterations in leukocyte survival following acute cardiac injury, 2) evaluate the impact of ?-blocker treatment on mouse and human leukocyte function and survival, and 3) differentiate the effects of leukocyte-specific biased ?2AR signaling on cardiac remodeling and survival following injury. Overall, we will attain a fundamental understanding of the mechanisms and influence of ?2AR signaling on the early immune response to cardiac injury and determine whether ?2AR-selective therapeutics would offer fine-tuned strategies to regulate ischemic injury-induced remodeling and survival outcomes."
"9382854","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The trans differentiation of pancreatic acinar cells to a duct-like, pluripotent progenitor cell type (ADM, acinar-to- ductal metaplasia) is an initial step leading to the development of pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN) and pancreatic cancer. ADM can be initiated after activation of the epidermal growth factor receptor, acquisition of activating mutations of Kras and macrophage-secreted cytokines. However, the common signaling mechanism driving ADM downstream of these inducers are largely unknown. It is our hypothesis that activation of a PKD1 signaling is a common feature of inducers of acinar-to-ductal metaplasia, driving the formation of PanINs and the progression to pancreatic tumors. To test this we will: Determine if activation of PKD1 is a common mechanism for different inducers of ADM (Specific Aim 1); identify PKD1 downstream signaling pathways that drive ADM and the formation of duct-like pancreatic progenitor cells (Specific Aim 2); determine if expression and/or activity of PKD1 indicate progression of ADM to PanINs and PDA in vivo (Specific Aim 3); and use genetic animal models to define the role of PKD1 in development of pancreatic cancer (Specific Aim 4). Successful completion of our project will identify PKD1 as a common feature of processes that initiate the development of pancreatic cancer. It also will define the signaling events up- and downstream of PKD1 that facilitate PanIN formation and contribute to development of pancreatic cancer. Early diagnosis and early targeting are key for successful intervention of pancreatic cancer. Our results will provide the basis for both, since PKD1 is a targetable kinase and can be a molecular signaling marker for early events."
"9456169","Project summary / Abstract Identification of uridylated RNA important for germline maintenance in C. elegans Fertility depends on formation and maintenance of a healthy germ line. In animals, the germ line typically derives from a very limited set of precursor cells that divide to expand the population before undergoing meiosis and gametogenesis. Maintenance of the germ line, as well as formation of high quality gametes, depends on mechanisms that ensure genome integrity as well as epigenetic processes that convey information via histone modification and small RNAs. This proposal addresses the role of poly(U) polymerase (PUP) activity in germ line maintenance and development. Poly(U) polymerases are nucleotidyl transferases that add uridine residues to the 3' end of RNA molecules. 3' uridylation is one of several post-transcriptional modifications known to modulate RNA stability. We have identified a redundant requirement for expression of two such enzymes, PUP-1 and PUP-2, in germ line survival and development in the model organism, C. elegans. PUP-1 and PUP-2 are implicated in modifying and destabilizing certain classes of small RNAs, as are their mammalian orthologs, TUT4 (ZCCHC11) and TUT7 (ZCCHC6). TUT4 and TUT7 also are known to modify mRNA, however it is not known if PUP-1 and/or PUP-2 have this activity. In this proposal, we will perform RNA sequencing experiments to identify uridylated small RNAs and mRNAs in wildtype and pup single and double mutant strains. This information will allow us to identify unique and common targets of PUP-1 and PUP-2 activity and to correlate the loss of uridylation with changes in RNA abundance. Our central hypothesis is that PUP activity modulates the abundance of small RNAs and mRNAs to ensure germ line maintenance and prevent transgenerational replicative aging of germ cells, as well as to ensure production of healthy gametes."
"9432203","Abstract:  Brucella infections can cause debilitating disease with relapses of an undulating fever and lifelong complications, including arthritis, endocarditis, and possible neurological complications, even with antibiotic treatment. Moreover, in many parts of the world, brucellosis remains problematic, and it is estimated that approximately 500,000 new cases occur annually, making brucellosis one of the most common zoonotic diseases globally. In humans, Brucella spp. causes a chronic infection that in some cases may be lifelong and permanently debilitating. However, mechanisms underlying Brucella?s ability to cause chronic infection remain largely unknown. The overall goal of this project is to better understand the role of B cells in the pathogenesis of chronic brucellosis. In our preliminary data, we found that B cells contained >90% of viable, recoverable, intracellular Brucella from infected wild-type mouse spleens. In the proposed studies, we will investigate the role of B cells as a reservoir of chronic Brucella infection and determine what genes Brucella requires to chronically infect B cells in vivo. In Aim #1 of this proposal we will determine what splenic B cell subsets harbor viable Brucella during acute and chronic infection. The role of specific B cell subsets (B1a and marginal zone B cells) in the pathogenesis of chronic brucellosis will also be assessed. In addition, we will determine if Brucella residing in B cells are resistant to T cell and/or vaccine-mediate immunity. In Aim #2 we will determine what Brucella genes are required to persistently colonize B cells in vivo. Collectively, our results will enhance our knowledge of the pathogenesis of chronic brucellosis and should also have implications for future rational design of Brucella vaccines."

"9428329","Abstract The foremost objective of my career is to become an independent and successful physician-scientist in the field of cardiovascular complications of chronic kidney disease (CKD). My passion to achieve this objective has helped me since my training began as a medical student in Hungary. To enrich my experience, knowledge and skills I pursued a PhD degree and worked relentlessly to establish the beginning of my career in U.S. Continuing on the same path, I was selected in the ABIM research pathway at UAB, a competitive combined program for residency, fellowship and research training. To fully achieve the goals of my career with an overall emphasis on improving the health of patients with kidney diseases, I will need further training and mentorship that will also serve as a fundamental requisite for successful completion of the following scientific premise:  Calcification of the vasculature is commonly found in patients with advanced CKD and is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. There is hence an urgent unmet need to find answers to etiologic and mechanistic questions in order to introduce novel therapeutics. Advanced CKD often results in phosphate retention and iron deficiency anemia. Whether such iron deficiency in advanced CKD patients promotes vascular calcification has not been elucidated. We previously reported that iron and 3H-1,2-Dithiole-3-thione (D3T) induced expression of intracellular ferritin heavy chain (FtH) mitigates transformation of vascular smooth muscle cells into osteoblast like cells. Based on our preliminary findings, we hypothesize that derangements in iron metabolism with subsequent decrements in intracellular FtH expression, accelerate CKD associated vascular calcification. In support of this concept, we hypothesize that parenteral iron administration may be considered to correct anemia and to prevent vascular calcification in CKD patients. We will also examine the exciting potential of D3T (a chemo-preventive agent and FtH stimulant), as a therapeutic/preventive agent against vascular calcification. In this study, we will utilize novel transgenic mice with conditional deletion of FtH in the vascular smooth muscle cell compartment to test this hypothesis in a model of CKD and hyperphosphatemia. Additionally, to fully understand the inhibitory role of FtH, we will utilize an unbiased analysis of gene expression using RNA seq and examine pathways that are involved in the vascular protective effects of FtH.  Of equal importance, this proposal will serve as a comprehensive strategy intended to transition me from trainee to independent investigator. I present a curriculum designed to enhance 1) knowledge base in vascular biology, bioinformatics and biostatistics, 2) technical repertoire with a focus on translational techniques, 3) professional development through peer mentoring and gaining skills in laboratory management. This training will be under the guidance of accomplished and respected mentors in a high quality environment for scientific discovery and career development. I plan to take full advantage of this training award with the overall objective of providing meaningful contributions to improve health and outcomes of patients with CKD."
"9392193","Abstract Autosomal dominant hereditary neutropenia (cyclic neutropenia and severe congenital neutropenia (SCN)) is usually caused by heterozygous mutations in ELANE (formerly known as ELA2), encoding the neutrophil granule serine protease, neutrophil elastase (NE). Two competing theories had been proposed to explain how mutant neutrophil elastase causes neutropenia. The ?mislocation? hypothesis holds that mutations disrupting NE's subcellular trafficking misroute proteolytic activity to the wrong destination. A competing ?misfolding? hypothesis posits that mutations activate the ER stress and unfolded protein response (UPR), leading to cell death. Both theories are supported by molecular and genetic data. Recent identification of ELANE translational start site mutations suggests a third, ?mistranslation? hypothesis, in which mutations force translation, either by loss of the canonical start site or by activating an internal ribosome entry site (IRES), to initiate from downstream in-frame ATG codons, producing amino-terminally truncated proteins bypassing `pre-pro' sequences directing trafficking and regulation of proteolytic activity. Thus, aberrant transport, protein folding, and proteolysis may contribute to pathogenesis. Heretofore, experimentally distinguishing among hypotheses has proven challenging, because patient samples are scarce, the affected cell type (neutrophil) is in low abundance, and mouse knock-in models fail to develop neutropenia. Here we show that patient-derived, induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) faithfully recapitulate clinical and molecular phenotypes and that CRISPR/Cas9 gene-editing of ELANE corrects patient germline mutations while reversing biochemical and developmental defects in iPSC, thus providing the first direct human model in which to study ELANE mutations after more than 15 years following their discovery. We propose to employ gene-editing of iPSC to target alterations in ELANE that each theory predicts would complement germline mutations. In the first aim, we specifically focus on removing internal translation initiation sites from ELANE in order to test the mistranslation hypothesis. In the second aim, we will inactivate NE's catalytic site in order to determine how aberrant proteolysis, central to at least two of the three hypotheses, contributes to pathogenesis. These studies will help elucidate mechanisms responsible for hereditary neutropenia, as well as normal granulopoiesis."
"9598253","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Gastric cancer is the second most common cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. There is growing evidence suggesting that cancer signaling networks are wired in a complex manner. This complexity is translated into poor clinical outcome, a common feature of gastric cancer. This wiring is not only important for maintaining cancer cell survival but also for providing supportive properties such as angiogenesis. The molecular targets that govern this interaction between the molecular signaling pathways that drive gastric tumorigenesis remain largely uncharacterized. Therefore, the identification of critical molecular targets, located at the hub of the signaling networks that bridge cancer signaling pathways, is a key step in understanding the biology of gastric cancer and improving our currently limited diagnostic, preventive, and therapeutic approaches. In the present proposal, we plan to pursue our novel finding that shows DARPP-32 at the interface of two key signaling pathways, NF-kB and STAT-3; thus playing a crucial role in the development and progression of the gastric tumorigenesis cascade. The proposal examines a novel hypothesis that transcription up-regulation of DARPP-32 by NF-kB connects cancer cell signaling pathways leading to activation of STAT3, thereby placing DARPP-32 as a bridge between two important signaling pathways amplifying their oncogenic signals promoting angiogenesis and tumorigenesis. We propose three specific aims to test our hypothesis. The first aim will test the transcription regulation of DARPP-32 by NF-kB and examine the mechanisms by which DARPP-32 regulates STAT3 signaling. These studies will define the role of DARPP-32 as a bridge between two important oncogenic signaling pathways, NF-kB and STAT3. In Aim 2, we will examine the biological outcome of the NF-kB - DARPP-32 - STAT3 axis, explore its role in regulating angiogenesis, and determine the therapeutic potential of targeting the DARPP-32 signaling axis. The third aim, will determine the role of DARPP-32 in promoting gastric tumorigenesis using genetic mouse models of DARPP-32 overexpression and knockdown. We will also explore the histopathological and clinical significance of overexpression of NF-kB - DARPP-32 - STAT3 in fully annotated de-identified human gastric cancer tissue samples. Our studies are conceptually innovative and of critical significance given the fact that the overall 5-year survival for gastric cancer is only 20%. Upon completion of our studies, the results will have a significant impact on understanding the biology of gastric cancer affecting our diagnostic, prognostic, and possibly clinical management of this disease."
"9468917","The goal of my research is to identify pathophysiological mechanisms and risk factors of Sudden Unexpected Death in Epilepsy (SUDEP) using transgenic mouse models. It is estimated that SUDEP accounts for up to 17% of all deaths in patients with epilepsy, making it the most common cause of premature mortality in epilepsy. Although the exact mechanism of death in SUDEP remains poorly defined, the MORTality in Epilepsy Monitoring Units Study (MORTEMUS) reported 10 cases of SUDEP where cardiorespiratory dysfunction occurred following a generalized tonic-clonic seizure, which led to central apnea followed by cardiac arrest. Serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine; 5-HT), an important modulatory neurotransmitter in the brain, has a well- characterized role in the control of breathing and defects in the 5-HT system have been linked to both respiratory dysfunction and SUDEP. For example, mice lacking the 5-HT2C receptor have spontaneous and audiogenic seizures that lead to premature death. Although the cause of death has not be quantitatively studied, anecdotal observations report death results from respiratory arrest. The epileptic phenotype of this strain has been poorly defined and the cause of seizures and premature death remains unclear. 5-HT2C receptors are distributed throughout the brain and a majority of the cells that express this receptor are GABAergic neurons. GABA is the predominant inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain and disruption of GABAergic signaling is strongly linked to hyperexcitability and seizures. In addition, GABA has an important role in both breathing and cardiovascular control. The Noebels laboratory has previously demonstrated that SUDEP mouse models are at higher risk for brainstem spreading depression, which mediates cardiorespiratory arrest and death. Therefore, I hypothesize that the loss of 5-HT2C receptors causes increased excitability via decreased GABAergic signaling in the brain and an increased risk for brainstem spreading depression. This proposal aims to study the role of 5-HT2C receptor signaling in GABAergic neurons and how the loss of 5-HT2C receptors leads to seizures and cardiorespiratory dysfunction. To achieve these goals, we propose the following research aims: 1) Determine the progression of epilepsy and cause of death in loxTB 5-HT2C mice, and 2) Define the role of 5-HT2C receptor signaling in GABAergic interneurons in CNS excitability and brainstem cardiorespiratory control. The first aim will investigate the cause of death in loxTB 5-HT2C mice and determine whether they have cardiorespiratory abnormalities at baseline and between seizures. The second aim will investigate whether loxTB 5-HT2C mice are at a higher risk for brainstem spreading depression and if 5-HT2C signaling in GABAergic neurons is sufficient to prevent seizures, cardiorespiratory dysfunction, and death in this transgenic line. The experiments proposed in this application will elucidate the role of 5-HT2C signaling in GABAergic neurons in neuron excitability and cardiorespiratory control."
"9567800","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The approximately 1.3 million new cases of nonmelanoma skin cancers diagnosed each year in the USA have a tremendous impact on public health and healthcare expenditures. Therefore, safe and effective chemopreventive strategies are urgently needed. Overexposure to solar ultraviolet (UV) radiation is a primary risk factor and that UV-induced immunosuppression plays a critical role in skin carcinogenesis. It is well established that UV irradiation induces inflammatory mediators, impairs the function of dendritic cells (DC) and effector T cells and induces suppressor T cells. UV-induced epigenetic modifications, such as DNA hypermethylation, seem to play an important role in photodamage of the skin. A model is now emerging that suggests that epigenetic modifications, including DNA hypermethylation, are induced by UVB-induced inflammatory mediators, such as cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2)/prostaglandin E2, and act as a mechanistic link between the inflammatory mediators and compromised DC function. We have demonstrated that topical administration of honokiol, a phytochemical from the Magnolia plant, prevents both photocarcinogenesis and UVB-induced immunosuppression in mice. Our preliminary data further indicate that honokiol can correct or inhibit DNA hypermethylation in UV-exposed dendritic cells and that this restores dendritic cell-mediated activities including stimulation of  cells. We propose to test the innovative hypothesis that inhibition of UVB-induced DNA hypermethylation by honokiol is critical for its chemopreventive effects on UV- induced immunosuppression. We propose three inter-related Specific Aims to test the hypothesis in a mouse model: (1) Determine whether honokiol-induced inhibition of UV-induced immunosuppression occurs through DNA demethylation in UV-exposed skin and whether the inflammatory mediators play a role in this; (2) Determine whether honokiol inhibits the development of UV-induced tolerogenic DCs and whether this is mediated through inhibition of DNA hypermethylation; and (3) Determine whether honokiol inhibition of UV- induced immunosuppression occurs through enhancement of T cell activation and whether this is mediated through inhibition of DNA hypermethylation. A combination of approaches will be utilized to verify the results including the use of COX-2 deficient mice. Innovation: The proposed studies will: (1) Identify the mechanisms by which topical or oral administration of honokiol acts to correct UV-induced immunosuppression and prevent photocarcinogenesis, thereby providing data needed for further clinical development of this promising phytochemical; and (2) The data generated will provide critical insights into the mechanisms that elicit UVB- induced DNA hypermethylation in DC and establish whether targeting of these mechanisms is sufficient to prevent UVB-induced immunosuppression. Impact: The development of new early intervention strategies using honokiol may help to reduce the risk of skin cancer in humans, as the risk of skin cancer is a major public health concern."
"9472719","ABSTRACT The basal ganglia are critical for the learning and subsequent selection of motor programs. In health, adaptive plasticity in the basal ganglia enables easy execution of complex motor tasks through formation of habits. Conversely, in disease, repetitive behaviors, addictions and compulsions are thought to derive from maladaptive plasticity involving basal ganglia circuitry. The efficacy of medications and deep brain stimulation targeting the basal ganglia to treat Parkinson disease offer examples of the benefits to be gained by understanding the mechanisms by which this circuitry modulates behavior. However, major gaps in our understanding of the functional principles of the basal ganglia limit more widespread and more effective targeting of this circuitry to alleviate other ailments deriving from dysfunction of this circuitry, such as addictions, compulsions, and dystonia. Historically, there have been wide gaps in the levels of analysis of brain plasticity mechanisms, typically involving isolated study of particular candidate synapses ex vivo and regional activity in awake behaving animals. However, emerging technologies to image and selectively manipulate brain circuitry now provide several key opportunities to bridge these levels of analysis. These opportunities can reveal how plasticity is organized across the local microcircuitry and enable finer levels of monitoring and perturbing activity in the awake behaving animal. In this mentored career award, an accomplished investigator in the field of synaptic plasticity and the basal ganglia, Dr. Calakos, proposes to undertake career enhancement activities to acquire new expertise in in vivo physiology and familiarity with the latest cutting-edge opportunities to evaluate and manipulate activity in vivo. In collaboration with key mentors, the research objectives will be to develop an approach to simultaneously image both classes of striatal projection neurons in vivo and to use that approach to evaluate the novel variable of relative latency to fire between the two neuronal classes of striatal projection neurons as a driver of habitual behavior."
"9378099","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Schizophrenia is a devastating neurodevelopmental disorder that often emerges in young adulthood, interfering with normal social development. The diagnosis is present in 1-2% of the population and cuts across socioeconomic, demographic and national lines, affects veterans as well as civilians, shaters families, and costs society billions in lost income due to social disability. The social deficits associated with schizophrenia wreak havoc on the lives of individuals who develop the disorder, and these deficits independently predict worse clinical, functional, and occupational outcomes above and beyond positive symptoms and other cognitive deficits. Despite their clinical importance, social deficits are poorly understood and resistant to available treatment options. Furthermore, abnormal neural and autonomic responses to social stimuli appear to underlie these deficits in schizophrenia. For example, patients demonstrate decreased activity of the parasympathetic nervous system (PNS), increased activity of the amygdala, and decreased activity of the ventral prefrontal cortex (vPFC) when performing certain social tasks. The neuropeptide oxytocin plays an important role in social behavior in animals and humans, increasing pro-social behavior and improving social cognition in healthy and autistic individuals. Oxytocin has also been shown to have positive effects on neural and autonomic responses in healthy individuals. Despite its potential as a new treatment for social deficits and for remediation of neurophysiological abnormalities, few studies have examined the effects of oxytocin on social cognition and behavior or on neural and autonomic responses to social stimuli in patients with schizophrenia. We propose a series of experiments aimed at both investigating the underlying neurophysiological mechanisms of oxytocin's pro-social effects and quantifying the potentially clinically useful effects of oxytocinin patients with recent-onset schizophrenia. In order to accomplish these important goals, we will first examine the effects of a single dose of exogenous oxytocin on behavioral and psychophysiological responses using validated social cognition measures in 45 patients with recent-onset schizophrenia and 45 matched healthy comparison subjects. We will also assess PNS activity as indexed by respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) in order to test the hypothesis that oxytocin promotes social behavior by increasing PNS tone. Next, we will examine if oxytocin administration normalizes neural responses to social stimuli by decreasing activity of the amygdala and increasing activity of the vPFC, using a well-studied fMRI social cognition paradigm in 36 of these patients and 36 of these healthy comparison subjects. If successful, these experiments will: 1) Provide novel and important data on the neurobiological factors that underlie social deficits in patients with schizophrenia; 2) Lead to larger clinical trials of oxytoin to improve clinical outcomes in young individuals with recent-onset schizophrenia; and 3) Provide a deeper understanding of the functional and mechanistic relationships linking interrelated neurophysiologic systems that support socially meaningful behavior in healthy and schizophrenic individuals. Studying young adult patients with recent-onset schizophrenia minimizes potential confounds of chronic illness including social isolation, drug abuse and neuroleptic use and maximizes the potential long-term impact of this intervention. Overall, this work has the potential to uncover mechanisms of social dysfunction in schizophrenia, and to identify a novel treatment for the difficult-to-treat social deficits of the illness."

"9425719","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (DESCRIPTION) Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is an autosomal dominant genetic disorder characterized by the development of potentially life-threatening vascular anomalies in several organs in the form of arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). HHT mutations are mostly found in the ALK1 and ENG genes and lead to a loss-of- function in the BMP9/10-ALK1-ENG signaling cascade. Evidence suggests that HHT arise from aberrant reactivation of angiogenesis and endothelial cell (EC)-driven hypervascularization. The overall goal of this program is to implement a screening and characterization strategy aimed at identifying FDA-approved drugs with disease-modifying properties and therapeutic potential in novel cellular and mouse models of HHT. We have screened the NIH clinical collections of FDA-approved drugs to identify molecules capable of activating ALK1 signaling in reporter cells. The immunophilin ligand tacrolimus (FK506) was identified as the most potent ALK1 activator. In preliminary studies, we confirmed that tacrolimus, as well as its analog sirolimus, are potent ALK1 signaling activators in ECs. Of significance, the two analog drugs prevented retinal vascular pathology in the transmammary model of BMP9/10-immunoblocking, an HHT mouse model recently developed in our laboratory. In addition, we determined that tacrolimus efficiently triggered ALK1 activation in primary ECs derived from an HHT patient carrying the well-described disease-causing ALK1-T372fsX mutation. Based on these results, we propose in Aims 1 and 2 of this application to assess and compare the therapeutic potential of tacrolimus and sirolimus in the transmammary model of BMP9/10-immunoblocking and in a new knockin mouse line expressing the HHT ALK1-T372fsX mutation. We will also generate a mini-bank of HHT patient- derived primary ECs, which will be used to delineate the mechanisms by which tacrolimus and sirolimus control ALK1 signaling (Aim 3). We believe that this comprehensive approach in relevant and powerful models of HHT not only will increase our understanding of the molecular underpinnings of the disease, but also will motivate new clinical investigations for HHT."
"9397545","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cataract formation is the most common cause of vision loss, accounting for 51% of cases of blindness worldwide. In the US, cataract operations cost the Medicare system approximately $5 billion annually. Epidemiologic studies show that the pathogenesis of human cataracts involves genetic, environmental, and other disease-associated risk factors. In particular, 50% of childhood cataract cases have a genetic basis. The lens crystallins protein family accounts for 90% of lens proteins and plays a key role in lens transparency. Research has identified point mutations in the genes encoding ?-, ß-, and ?-crystallins, which lead to hereditary human cataract formation either at birth or at an early age. Functional studies on hereditary cataract formation could provide important information about the etiology of age-related cataracts. ?-crystallin is an aggregate of two polypeptides, ?A- and ?ß-crystallin, that are expressed in lens epithelial and fiber cells. Human patients harboring single point mutations in ?A- and ?ß-crystallin genes develop hereditary cataracts. To understand disease etiology in hereditary cataracts, we have used embryonic stem cell-based technologies to generate knock-in mice expressing proteins containing either the ?A-R49C or ?B-R120G mutation in ?-crystallins. These two mutations are associated with human autosomal dominant hereditary cataracts. We are also studying a knockout mouse lacking both ?A- and ?ß-crystallin. These mouse models develop cataracts at an early postnatal age and are important tools for understanding the disease process. Our first aim will test the hypothesis that ?A-crystallin mutation or deletion causes upregulation of histone and metabolic enzyme expression in the developing lens at an early postnatal age. The second aim will test the hypothesis that mutant ?A- or ?ß-crystalline disrupts normal lens protein homeostasis, leading to abnormal protein loss through autophagy. To address these aims, we will use complementary biochemical, cell biological and genetic approaches which are quantitative, objective and not subject to observer bias. The results of our studies will provide new insights into the molecular basis of lens development and cataract formation and promote the development of strategies to delay or prevent cataracts."
"9411765","Project Summary/Abstract  Research indicates that pediatric obesity prevalence is high among all children, but that children from rural areas are disproportionately affected. There are very few interventions specifically targeting pediatric obesity treatment among rural children, a factor that contributes to this health disparity. Previous research from our lab indicates that mHealth is feasible and acceptable for the delivery of pediatric obesity interventions to rural children as this type of intervention lowers child Body Mass Index z score (BMIz) and helps children and families to significantly change their health behaviors. The current application extends this work in a new and innovative direction by moving the mHealth intervention into rural family homes, increasing convenience and dose simultaneously. The intervention is composed of both group and individual family level components, based upon new research that indicates this combination is highly effective. Finally, the composition of the intervention groups is also innovative as they will be composed of children from the same school, making individual level factors as well as factors clustered at the school level addressable in one intervention. The current study proposes to compare the effectiveness of two active interventions: iAmHealthy vs. control (a newsletter control group) using in cluster-randomized design. iAmHealthy is a 32 week behavioral intervention focused on nutrition, behavior and physical activity that engages parents and children in treatment using mHealth technology. It combines family based behavioral groups with individual level child and family support ? all provided directly to homes via mHealth technologies. Children and families meeting inclusion criteria from a total of 18 schools will be randomly assigned by school to condition, with at least 8 families participating at each rural school, for a total of 144 child and 144 adult participants. We hypothesize that: the iAmHealthy intervention will result in significantly greater improvement in food choices than the active control intervention (as indicated by servings of sugar sweetened beverages, number of servings of ?red foods,? and number of servings of fruits and vegetables); the iAmHealthy intervention will result in significantly greater improvement in levels of physical activity than the control intervention (as indicated by change in number of minutes of moderate/vigorous physical activity); and, that the iAmHealthy intervention will result in significantly greater improvement in child BMIz and parent BMI than the control intervention. Aim 2 uses the RE-AIM framework to measure the effectiveness of iAmHealthy. iAmHealthy is an easily scalable, widely disseminable pediatric obesity intervention option for rural children and families, if found to be effective; the results of the current study could significantly alter the way we treat pediatric obesity among high risk and underserved rural children."
"9457790","TITLE: FDC regulation of self-reactive B cells Abstract: Systemic lupus erythematosus (lupus) is a B cell disease characterized by secretion of pathogenic autoantibody specific for nuclear antigens or DAMPS. A hallmark of the disease is spontaneous formation of germinal centers (GC) in spleen and lymph nodes and development of pathogenic long- lived memory B cells. Follicular dendritic cells (FDC) which are stromal derived and important in maintaining the architecture of B cell follicles are essential to formation and maintenance of GC as they are a major source of B cell antigen and survival factors. We propose FDC play a critical role in the regulation of tolerance of autoreactive B cells and their differentiation and secretion of pathogenic antibodies. Using a lupus-prone mouse model, we found that FDC uptake of nuclear antigens via CD21 triggers endosomal TLR promoting B cell loss of tolerance and differentiation. Thus, FDC are not only a critical source of self-antigen; but they are an important source of signals that can ?drive? self-reactive B cells to differentiate into autoantibody producing cells and memory B cells. These findings suggest FDC may be a novel target for therapy in lupus patients. To test this possibility in a pre-clinical model, lupus mice will be treated over a period of 1 month with a blocking antibody to the CD21 receptor expressed by FDC. Our hypothesis will take advantage of several novel murine models such as a human-mouse CD21 chimeric lupus mouse where the FDC express murine CD21 and the B cells express human CD21. Using this novel system, we will test the efficacy of anti-mouse CD21 therapy in the elimination of retention of nuclear antigens by FDC and turning-off TLR signaling and cytokine secretion. Three aims are proposed: Aim 1. Test the hypothesis that the tolerance of self-reactive B cells is regulated by FDCs Aim 2. Test the hypothesis that the maintenance of self-reactive memory B cells is FDC-dependent Aim 3. Test the efficacy of blocking CD21 in lupus mouse models Summary: The successful completion of this study will not only provide valuable reagents and novel tools to push the field forward but it could lead to development of novel strategies and/or blocking therapies for systemic autoimmunity such as lupus."
"9425883","Cancer immunotherapies that exploit ex vivo manipulation of a patient's own cells can generate significant anti- tumor immune responses, but present significant practical limitations. Nanoparticle-based antigen presenting systems provide an alternative approach to generate anti-tumor responses without ex vivo cell manipulation, but the defined antigens will likely need to be personalized to each patient. We have demonstrated a new concept, the use of implantable biomaterials that can localize large numbers of dendritic cells (DCs) from the host, and efficiently activate these cells while loading with antigens derived from a tumor biopsy. This approach demonstrated unprecedented ability to promote regression of established tumors in several pre- clinical models, and we have recently initiated a Phase I trial of this new approach to treat stage IV melanoma patients. However, the antigen in this vaccine is derived from a biopsy, leading to the requirement that each vaccine be manufactured for a specific patient, and the vaccine requires surgical implantation. This project is based on the premise that combining delivery of traditional chemotherapeutic agents and biomaterial- based vaccination will lead to therapeutic immune responses, by generating patient-specific antigen in situ, obviating the need to identify or load antigen onto vaccines prior to placement in the body. Our hypothesis will be tested using the following Aims: (1) Develop cryogels capable of being injected intra and/or peritumorally that recruit DCs through GM-CSF release, and control the timing of release of nanoparticles (NPs) containing toll like receptor ligands from the biomaterial vaccine in order to concentrate and activate DCs within the tumor, and enhance their trafficking to the draining lymph node. (2) Determine the impact of an approach to localize immunostimulatory chemotherapeutic agents to tumors on cancer cell death, and determine the impact of combined chemotherapy and vaccination on tumor growth and the tumor-specific host immune response. (3) Examine the ability of vaccination at the primary tumor to yield therapeutic effects on distant tumors in the body, and combine the biomaterial-based vaccine strategy with checkpoint blockade therapy. These studies will utilize both transplantable tumor models and a transgenic melanoma model. This project will result in the development of a new, patient-specific vaccination strategy that does not require personalized manufacturing. We expect this vaccine strategy will synergize with checkpoint blockade therapy, yielding robust and systemic therapeutic benefit."
"9429209","ABSTRACT  Nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) are ubiquitous organisms that cause chronic pulmonary infection, particularly in individuals with pre-existing lung disease, such as COPD and cystic fibrosis. With an increasing incidence, pulmonary NTM disease has far surpassed that of tuberculosis in the US. Mycobacterium avium (M. avium) is responsible for the vast majority of morbidity and mortality from pulmonary NTM disease, while M. abscessus is one of the most virulent and feared subspecies of NTM, given its high levels of drug- resistance and notoriously poor treatment outcomes despite prolonged antibiotic courses. While there are numerous known mutations that are associated with drug resistance in NTM, their predictive value remains vague. Sadly, antibiotic selection in NTM remains an art and not a science, which should not be the case in the current era of whole-genome sequencing and precision medicine. This application seeks to harness the advances of genomics and personalized medicine to improve the health of patients with NTM disease.  My research to date has revealed new insights into the evolutionary patterns of resistance in M. tuberculosis, as well as novel molecular mechanisms of resistance to cycloserine and beta-lactams. My fellowship research has led to 10 publications, five of which as first-author, including two first-author papers in Nature Genetics, and one first-author paper in PLoS Medicine. My prior experience with mycobacteriology, genomics of drug resistance, and clinical training in pulmonary medicine combined with support from my eminent co-mentors, make me uniquely qualified to undertake these innovative new studies of mechanisms of resistance in clinically relevant NTM.  In this proposal, I will establish a prospective observational cohort of patients with NTM at the Johns Hopkins NTM Clinic. In a longitudinal manner, I will monitor the clinical progress of cohort members as well as collect serial mycobacterial isolates at each clinic visit. Both retrospectively biobanked strains and prospectively collect clinical isolates of M. avium and M. abscessus will be characterized by extensive phenotypic drug susceptibility testing in addition to whole-genome sequencing. Pairing phenotypic and genomic data will enable me to identify genomic elements that highly correlate with resistance. With a focus on macrolides, rifampin, oxazolidonones and beta-lactams, I will perform molecular validation studies using gene replacement to validate that these candidate genetic features do in fact confer phenotypic resistance to their respective drug. In my final aim, I will seek to investigate the yet unknown molecular basis for rifampin resistance in M. avium and M. abscessus and the potential for efflux pump inhibition to restore susceptibility to this key drug. At the end of these five years, these studies have a high probability of leading to rapid PCR- based diagnostics and for drug resistance in these pathogens."
"9391972","ABSTRACT -Translational Cancer Imaging (TCI) Shared Resource  The goal of the Translational Cancer Imaging (TCI) resource is to provide cancer center members with a  comprehensive imaging service that will facilitate basic, clinical, as well as translational cancer research at  UNC. The TCI has expanded from the original Small Animal Imaging Core to include four key units: 1)  Cyclotron & Imaging Probe; 2) Preclinical Imaging; 3) Clinical Research Imaging; and 4) Image Analysis. The  expansion of the imaging core will not only enhance our overall imaging capability, but also greatly expedite  cancer research developed from basic science to clinical application with advanced tools and channels built  within the TCI. The new Cyclotron and Imaging Probe unit contains all the equipment needed to support  radiopharmaceutical development, clinical translation, and probe production for molecular imaging studies.  Key components include state of the art radiochemistry research facility with a high energy (16.5 MeV) GE  PETtrace cyclotron, multiple automated radiochemical processing modules, clean room, hot cells and other  ancillary equipment. The Animal Imaging unit has a new mouse 3,000 cage holding unit and houses eleven  pieces of imaging equipment dedicated for animal studies, including a 9.4T animal MR scanner, one animal  PET/CT scanner, one SPECT/CT scanner, one high resolution microCT for specimens, one microCT systems  for in vivo studies, two high resolution ultrasound system, three IVIS optical imaging systems, and one 3D  tomographic fluorescence imaging system. With all the equipment located in one centralized space, the  preclinical imaging unit is capable of providing non-invasive imaging, longitudinal studies, as well as  multimodality imaging on animal models in various cancer applications. The Human Imaging unit is equipped  with one 3T whole body MRI scanner, one integrated MRI/PET scanner, one PET/CT scanner, and one whole  body 7T MRI scanner, all dedicated for clinical research. Again, they are all located in one centralized space  right above the animal Imaging unit. These dedicated instruments strongly support the translational cancer  research in a seamless fashion. The Image Analysis unit will continue to provide advanced analysis tools,  customized software, and data storage and transfer tools to support imaging studies. For the next funding  cycle, the TCI proposes two major aims, namely 1) to enhance infrastructure for imaging probe services and  translational development; 2) strengthen animal and human imaging support in cancer research. We will  enhance the infrastructure to provide imaging probe development and production services for both preclinical  and clinical usage. Meanwhile, we will continue expanding our imaging capability, improving infrastructures for  translational imaging study, and promoting human imaging research."
"9448061","Ongoing pulmonary capillary hemorrhage (PCH) induced by pulmonary diagnostic ultrasound (PDUS) in mammals is displayed as growing comet-tail artifacts in the image. This phenomenon represents the only clearly demonstrated biological effect of (non-contrast enhanced) diagnostic ultrasound in medicine. When discovered in 1990 using laboratory exposure systems, only harmless incidental diagnostic ultrasound exposure was expected, and no useful safety strategies arose from authoritative reviews in 2000 and 2008. However, direct PDUS now is becoming routine in formal and bedside clinical settings. Point-of-care ultrasonography often involves pulmonary examination by physicians not necessarily aware of PCH or the deficiency in safety. As bedside PDUS becomes routine worldwide, many patients will receive direct lung exposure and suffer a risk of PCH injury. Our objective is to fully understand PDUS-PCH and find solutions for this uniquely important safety issue. Novel and unexpected findings thus far have thoroughly revised our understanding of pulmonary injury by PDUS. PCH thresholds are virtually independent of ultrasound frequency and well below the Mechanical Index safety limit. Physiological factors, such as clinical sedatives, can be as important as physical exposure parameters. These worrisome findings overturn present PDUS safety assumptions and imply that sick people or patients taking certain medications may be most vulnerable to injury. Initial consideration of my hypothesis of acoustical radiation surface pressure for the physical mechanism of PCH only partly explained this bioeffect. Our central hypothesis is that PDUS-PCH arises from the interaction of ultrasound pulses with susceptible alveolar blood-air-barrier structures, generating capillary stress and failure. Our research has set the stage for rapid progress and three specific aims are planned using rigorous scientific method to ensure validity and reproducibility: First, the physiological susceptibility to PDUS- PCH will be determined for inhalation restriction, widely used medications, inflammation by pneumonia and sex. Second, the remaining physics of PDUS-PCH will be characterized, including the relative efficacy of imaging modes, the sites of initiation and progression of PCH in microscopical observations and the temporal evolution of PCH from nanoseconds to minutes. Finally, the propagation and interaction of ultrasound pulses within lung will be characterized by acoustical modeling at the scale of the acinus, by micro-scale finite element analysis of alveolar capillary architecture and blood-air-barrier stresses, and by research in swine, together with chest-wall dosimetry, for realistic translation of risk estimation to human patients. The outcomes expected from achieving these aims are an understanding of lung susceptibility in different patients, the elucidation of the physical mechanism causing PDUS-PCH, and a path to clinical safety assurance, with minimal loss of image quality, suitable for sonographer education and guidance. The overall impact of this project will be the initiation of new safety concepts for PDUS and the proactive solution of this emergent public health problem."

"9418604","Title: Multi-point MR-ARFI for time-efficient volumetric tissue stiffness imaging The ability to detect and characterize changes in tissue properties that are indicative of necrosis is essential for successful control of ablative therapies. As tissue is ablated, changes occur in cell structure, in the distribution of tissue water, and in the nature of the macromolecular structure. Imaging techniques that discriminate and accurately characterize tissue property changes are critically needed to ensure ablative therapy success. Focused ultrasound (FUS), a completely non-invasive and highly promising interventional technology that is able to ablate a range of pathologies, has a critical need for improved methods to detect, monitor, and interpret the resulting changes in tissue properties. MRI guidance of FUS (MRgFUS) procedures provides excellent anatomic images of tissues to be treated and normal tissues to be spared, and can monitor temperature distribution changes in aqueous (non-adipose) tissues to ensure treatment efficacy and safety. Diagnostic ultrasound, when used for guiding FUS (USgFUS) procedures, has poor anatomic image quality and limited ability to measure temperature, but can image tissue stiffness and mechanical properties that change with treatment. Although MRI can measure tissue stiffness in terms of displacement caused by an acoustic radiation force impulse (MR-ARFI), the force is typically applied at a single point, providing only a local measurement of tissue stiffness. Although MR-ARFI could sequentially interrogate multiple positions at a cost of increased acquisition time, there is not a time efficient method to simultaneously interrogate the distribution of tissue stiffness at multiple points.  Our goal in this study is to develop and evaluate a time-efficient MR-ARFI method for volumetric tissue stiffness imaging. This goal will be accomplished with three aims: 1) Implement and evaluate efficiencies in interleaving multiple single-point MR-ARFI measurements; 2) Implement and evaluate simultaneous or near simultaneous multiple-point MR-ARFI methods; 3) Evaluate the accuracy and repeatability of multiple point MR-ARFI displacement measurements.  This new method of volumetric stiffness imaging will enable future studies to measure tissue stiffness properties before, during, and after MRgFUS procedures, and to correlate tissue property changes with other factors such as thermal dose during the procedure and the histologic state of the tissue after the procedure. Assessing tissue displacement in response to the applied force of FUS will allow an effective remote palpation of the evolving thermal lesion formed by the MRgFUS treatment at multiple positions and times during the procedure. If this stiffness change is an indicator of necrosis, this will increase the amount of information available to determine a successful outcome."

"9385352","ABSTRACT: This application is designed to address the scientific goals of RFA-AI-16-053. Using novel and non-invasive optical imaging with mathematical modeling, we will study longitudinal changes in vascular sequalae up to 70 days after radiation, in order to cover acute and delayed effects in multiple organs. We will also examine the role of the Notch-delta-like ligand 4 (Dll4) in regulating vascular changes after radiation. The Notch pathway is key to vascular development and has recently been shown to regulate vascular regression. Radiation is known to induce regression of blood vessels in multiple organs. For detailed mechanistic analyses, we will measure Notch-Dll4 intermediates in the vasculature of two irradiated organs that are the most sensitive to the late effects of radiation, the lungs and kidneys. We will support these studies by measuring perfusion and regression in the same models at the same time points after radiation. Further, we will define the role of a successful mitigator of delayed effects of acute radiation exposure (DEARE), the drug lisinopril, in Notch-Dll4- mediated regression. Lisinopril is an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor that improves survival after radiation in pre-clinical and clinical studies. These aims will be carried out in a whole animal model using wild type and genetically modified rat strains. We will deliver radiation to multiple organs using total body irradiation without or with one leg out of the field of exposure with high doses of 7.5 Gy or 13 Gy respectively. These radiation models are very well established in our laboratory facilitating reliable and robust data collection. The in vivo studies will be supported by ex vivo and molecular methods using isolated organs and blood vessels. We will also use irradiated and control rat and human endothelial cells in culture to compare Notch-Dll4 signaling responses. With strong statistical support, our strategy will ensure a robust and unbiased approach. The cutting-edge technology we have proposed in the application have feasible alternatives, relevant biological variables (female and male rats) and appropriate, quantitative milestones. The strength of our application lies in an integrated team of experts in radiobiology, engineering, mathematical modeling, vascular biology, animal care, clinical medicine, radiation physics and accurate dosimetry."
"9435634","Project Summary/Abstract Numerous species of mosquitoes are vectors of many pathogens that cause devastating infectious diseases, such as malaria, Dengue, yellow fever, and Zika fever. More than 1 million deaths and up to 700 million cases of infections by mosquito-borne vector diseases (nearly 10% of the total world population) are reported each year. The use of chemical insecticides has been a highly efficient method for the disruption of the pathogen transmission cycle by suppressing the vector population, whereas the evolution of insecticide resistance has hampered the efficacy of currently available classes of insecticides. We propose to establish a new approach for the development of a novel class of mosquitocidal compounds. In the era of new biotechnology, the search for small bioactive compounds using high throughput screening (HTS) is now a robust and accessible technology that can offer substantive dividends for users. The target molecule for the HTS assay we propose is a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR), named ecdysis-triggering hormone receptor (ETH-R), which is a receptor for a crucial hormone in the unique biology of arthropods for shedding of their external cuticle during molting and for regulation of another crucial endocrine factor juvenile hormone in mosquito. The ETH-R is an ideal target that will allow for the identification of an effective product with significantly improved selectivity toward mammals and even different orders of insects, which will permit the suppression of the mosquito population without significant environmental damage. Target-based discovery of insecticidal compounds will provide a novel example of a biorational approach for the development of pesticide. In this proposal, we aim to identify compounds that act on ETH receptor of the most devastating malaria mosquito (Anopheles gambiae, AgETH-R) by using HTS. We will also identify the structure of the peptide ligands ETH to understand the chemical interaction of the ligand on the binding pocket of the ETH-R. Four investigators in two different Universities will collaborate for the Specific Aims that require diverse areas of disciplines. The specific aims are: 1) High throughput screening for identifying agonists and antagonists acting on AgETH-R [Drs. Roy and Park], 2) Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy to determine the structures of AgETH and similar peptide ligands [Drs. Prakash and Park], and 3) Cheminformatics to identify the chemical signature of the hits and the chemical clusters for further tests [Drs. Huan and Park]."
"9388345","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Computed tomography (CT) has become a mainstay in diagnostic imaging. The high clinical impact of CT has led to rapidly increased utilization and, at the same time, public concerns about the potential risk to patients. Although many technologies have been developed to reduce radiation dose from CT, significant additional improvements are needed to minimize radiation dose without compromising diagnostic performance. In this U01 project, the interdisciplinary team will develop dose-saving technologies for three key CT imaging chain components and demonstrate their clinical benefits by systematic integration and evaluation. Specifically, the three components comprise (1) a fully dynamic x-ray source that adaptively modulates the radiation incident on a patient; (2) an energy-discriminating photon-counting x-ray detector with small detector pitch, high count-rate, and five energy windows; and (3) an advanced low-dose spectral reconstruction methods in a compressive sensing and statistical reconstruction framework. The proposed source, detector and reconstruction technologies are highly synergistic. These technologies will be integrated into a CT test-bed system to provide high dose efficiency permitting sub-mSv CT scans for common diagnostic procedures, fine spatial resolution nearly doubling what is provided by the state-of-the-art commercial CT scanners, and equally important, spectral imaging capabilities to facilitate or enable material characterization and other applications. The performance of the proposed CT test-bed will be thoroughly investigated in numerical simulation, and validated with physical and ex vivo experiments. The characterized performance will set the stage for the development of future clinical CT scanners. Because the novel technologies developed in this project are compatible with 3rd generation fan-beam/multi-slice CT system geometries, it would be relatively easy for manufacturers to translate them into products for broad clinical use. If the aims of the U01 project are realized, the benefits to the radiological community will be dramatic: general-purpose CT imaging at radiation dose less than 1 mSv, the largest improvement in CT spatial resolution in over 30 years, and powerful spectral CT imaging capabilities with numerous opportunities."
"9405403","Gastrointestinal Malignancies Program Project Summary / Abstract The overarching goals of the Program are to prevent, detect early, and manage more accurately and effectively the treatment of GI malignancies. The Program will take full advantage of cutting-edge genomic technologies to identify genetic and epigenetic changes that are important in initiation and progression of GI cancers, as well as their response to therapy. Given the complexity and heterogeneity of GI malignancies, the Program had historically emphasized pancreatic and colorectal cancers, two of the four leading causes of US cancer deaths. However, with the expanding expertise and accomplishments of the Program in the other GI cancers during the previous funding period, the Program has intensified efforts in hepatobiliary, esophagogastric, and neuroendocrine tumors. The program has 95 members, representing seven DF/HCC institutions and 12 academic departments. In 2014 peer-reviewed grant funding attributed to the Program was $5.9 million in total costs from the NCI and $5.3 million from other sponsors. During the current funding period, Gastrointestinal Malignancies Program members published 2,003 cancer-relevant papers. Of these 33% were inter-institutional, 24% were intra-programmatic, and 45% were inter-programmatic collaborations between two or more DF/HCC members. Overall, when counted once, 27% of DF/HCC publications were inter- programmatic collaborations."
"9391194","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Disruption of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) has an important part in cellular damage in neurological diseases, including acute and chronic cerebral ischemia, brain trauma, multiple sclerosis, brain tumors, and brain infections. A crucial aspect of the design of treatment protocols to reduce BBB disruption in several brain disorders is the dual nature of the molecules targeted for treatment. Indeed, many of those molecules that participate in neural cell death in the early stages of the injury also have a critical role in the recovery period. For example, the benefit derived from the treatment with matrix metalloproteinase inhibitors in the early stages of brain injury may be lost if the same enzymes are blocked in the later stages when they are used in neurogenesis and neurovascular unit (NVU) angiogenesis. Thus, the challenge to modulate BBB in brain diseases involve the identification of novel molecular signals that allow one to repair the NVU injury and modulate vascular brain permeably without interfering with neural recovery. Recently we discovered that miR-107 targets dicer at the post-transcriptional level during hindbrain neurogenesis to preferentially regulate th biogenesis of the pro-neurogenic miRNA, miR-9 (Ristori E., Dev Cell 2015, in press). miR-107-/- fish, that lack miR-107-dicer-miR-9 regulation, have an increased number of glia progenitors and neurons. We also discovered that miR-107 mutants have a disrupted BBB integrity. How the loss of miR-107 induces breakage of the NVU is not known. Here we propose to study the vascular defect in the miR-107 mutants. miR-107 expression is highly conserved in the human brain under physiological conditions. Importantly, miR-107 levels are decreased in neural pathogenesis such as glioblastoma and upon traumatic brain injury in which increase in neurogenesis and the BBB disruption are common hallmarks. Therefore, studies of miR-107-/- model can provide in the long term a unique window into the events that drive neurogenesis and NVU injury in neurological disorders in which miR-107 expression is lost."
"9446206","Project Summary  Drugs targeting the liver stage offer many advantages over drugs that merely target the blood stage. First, drugs active against the liver stage represent true causally prophylactic agents that can prevent all disease symptoms, including death, associated with malaria. Secondly, it has been established that while wild-caught mosquitoes may harbor thousands of sporozoites, only ?10 sporozoites are transferred in a single bite to the human host. Over the next 2-3 weeks the sporozoite reproduces in the liver to produce 10,000-30,000 descendants before the schizont ruptures and parasites flood into the bloodstream where the absolute parasite burden may increase to ten thousand billion (1013) circulating plasmodia. Clearly it is advantageous to strike at the liver stage where parasite numbers are low, to diminish the likelihood of selecting for a drug resistant mutant and before the infection has a chance to weaken the defenses of the human host. Our primary goal in this project is to develop a drug combination that is active against P. falciparum, causative agent of the most virulent, often fatal form of malaria. The drug combination will act synergistically while targeting the parasite in the liver, blood and also the vector stages that are critical for disease transmission. Studies (by us and others) have shown that ELQ-300 targets all 3 of these life cycle stages. The ultimate objective of our proposed work is the development of an inexpensive ELQ-300 prodrug that can be co-formulated with other antimalarials in a synergistic combination to prevent and treat malaria and support the worldwide effort to control and eradicate the disease. This study focuses on the combination of ELQ-300 prodrugs with biguanides including proguanil. We seek a better understanding of the biochemical mechanism that underlies the antimalarial synergism that exists between ELQ-300 and biguanides. A better understanding of this interaction will help to design a biguanide/ELQ-300 prodrug combination that is safe for use in humans for weekly prophylaxis and treatment of malaria."
"9421237","In spite of major improvements in treating high-risk neuroblastoma (NB) over the past 2 decades, greater than 50% of recurrent high-risk NB patients still die of the disease. A critical challenge in developing new drugs for NB is the limited number of patients available for clinical trials. Preclinical models that represent the biological diversity (including drug resistance mechanisms) are needed for biological and preclinical therapeutic studies. The Children's Oncology Group (COG) NB committee has made providing patient samples to our laboratory a major priority, enabling us to establish 200 NB cell lines and a growing number (32 to date) of patient-derived xenografts (PDX) which are freely available to investigators world-wide via the COG Cell Line and Xenograft Repository (www.COGcell.org). To enhance the value of these NB preclinical models to the many labs utilizing them we propose to define the genomic landscape, gene expression profiles, and response to selected drugs in these models. Cell lines providing data that inform xenograft experiments would be a valuable resource and cell line xenografts are necessary for certain animal imaging experiments. We have established cell lines and PDXs from the same patient samples enabling a comparison of cell lines to cell line xenografts, and both to PDXs. Our hypotheses are: 1) A large well-characterized panel of cell lines and PDXs from patients encompassing the spectrum of high-risk NB biology after exposure to current therapies is essential for progress in developing novel therapeutics against recurrent disease. 2) Low-passage cell lines established in physiological hypoxia will yield drug response data both in vitro and as cell line xenografts that will be comparable to PDXs.  The goals of this study are: 1) To characterize panels of NB in vitro and in vivo models, including isogenic pairs, (i.e. both cell line and PDX established from the same patient sample and also pairs established at diagnosis and from the same patient at disease progression) in terms of genomic landscape, genome-wide expression patterns (by RNA sequencing), expression of 200 selected proteins, and response to standard-of-care drugs. 2) To compare drug sensitivity to genomic alterations and genome-wide RNA expression to define molecular mechanisms of drug resistance. 3) To define the similarities or differences between cell line xenografts and PDXs using pairs of cell lines and PDXs established from the same clinical sample. 4) To compare the genomics of PDXs and cell lines to original patient tumor tissue and drug response data with PDXs and cell lines to clinical activity in patients of the same drugs. Our ultimate goal is to characterize a large robust panel of preclinical NB models for specific genomic abnormalities, genome-wide gene RNA expression and selected protein expression, and sensitivity/resistance to drugs commonly used for therapy and to ensure these models are readily available to all investigators studying neuroblastoma.  "
"9392897","PROJECT SUMMARY  Neuropathic pain occurs in epidemic proportions worldwide and none of the currently available therapeutics provides adequate pain relief and all have significant side effects. None are ?disease modifying? as all are simply palliative in targeting symptoms, not cause. There must be a better approach to pain control.  What we have discovered could potentially revolutionize the clinical treatment of trauma and surgical pa- tients, all of whom are at marked risk (~50-70%) for developing neuropathic pain. Our discovery is that 6 wk of moderate voluntary exercise that ceases at the time of nerve trauma appears to permanently suppress the lat- er development of neuropathic pain. Such an effect has never been previously reported.  The core thesis of this proposal is that novel, superior pharmacological and/or herbalism treatment strate- gies will arise from understanding how non-pharmacological voluntary exercise produces dramatic prevention of chronic pain. The critical first step is to understand how VWR prevents chronic pain. This enlightens target- ed, evidence-based steps toward achieving the same dramatic prevention of pain via pharmacological and/or herbal medicine approaches. The mechanisms explored in the present proposal are unique from those of any currently available pain therapeutic. If we can understand and harness prevention of neuropathic pain, this should lead to early drug interventions of broad practical importance.  How 6 wk voluntary wheel running (VWR) could profoundly influence the cascade of neuroimmunological and neuropathological events set into motion by later nerve injury has never been explored. This is critical to understand at a mechanistic level, as prior VWR appears to be the first ?disease modifying? approach to con- trolling whether chronic pain develops. Understanding how this occurs will enable development of novel drug regimens to pharmacologically duplicate these effects without the necessity of exercise regimens that few peo- ple will follow.  We predict that understanding how prior voluntary exercise (VWR) exerts such powerful, and seemingly permanent suppression of neuropathic pain is a tractable research goal, addressable by the multi-disciplinary approach proposed. This would first seek to understand the behavioral, immunological, neuroimmunological, and functional effects of: (a) VWR, (b) nerve injury (classic sciatic chronic constriction injury [CCI] model in male and female rats), and (c) their interaction on the aftermath of nerve injury. Based on these findings, mechanistic studies are proposed so to begin to explore how prior VWR could exert such a positive, pain- preventative effect on later nerve injury. Toward this goal, studies that seek to inhibit and to recapitulate the effects of VWR are both proposed. The long term aim is to capitalize on the understanding of how prior VWR creates such long-lasting suppression of neuropathic pain so to identify clinically relevant approaches to neu- ropathic pain prevention, thereby providing a far superior approach to pain control than currently available."
"9446348","Project Summary/Abstract Because infertility is a growing public health problem, it is imperative that we understand the basic mechanisms and identify the genetic risk factors that give rise to this disease. The most common genetic abnormality that causes miscarriage is aneuploidy, an embryo with an improper number of chromosomes. While increased risk of aneuploidy is strongly correlated with increasing maternal age, significant variation exists in aneuploidy rates at any given age, making age alone an inadequate biomarker for the risk of producing an aneuploid conception. Therefore, we hypothesize that women who produce higher than average levels of preimplantation stage aneuploidy at a given age possess causal variants in genes which predispose them to an early risk of producing an aneuploid conception. To test this hypothesis, we will sequence the exomes of women at the extremes of the preimplantation aneuploidy phenotype. This project requires a significant number of prior achievements, including the creation of a DNA bank from women who have undergone in vitro fertilization (IVF) and comprehensive chromosome screening (CCS) of IVF-derived embryos, and the development and validation of an accurate method of CCS. Both of these hurdles have now been overcome making this proposal feasible. To achieve statistical power to accurately identify disease-causing genes, this study will complete exome-sequencing efforts that were initiated with pilot project funds. Previously identified candidate genes and those identified by sequencing in this project will be evaluated for functional significance in an animal model, because studies involving introduction of mutant genes are not possible in humans. These approaches will shed light on the molecular mechanisms that control chromosome segregation in female gametes. Ultimately, this study could lead to the identification of maternal genetic markers for risk of producing an aneuploid conception, and help prevent infertility by empowering women with necessary and personalized information to better preserve their individual fertility."
"9456151","ABSTRACT Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is a major autoimmune disease that poses significant challenges to afflicted individuals, to the development of effective therapeutic interventions, and to public health initiatives at large. Initiated and perpetuated by a complex interplay of genetic and environmental risk factors, insulin-secreting pancreatic beta-cells are progressively destroyed by aberrant immune responses leading to elevated blood glucose levels as well as serious disturbances of protein, fat and carbohydrate metabolism. At present, no cure or effective prevention is available and despite insulin treatment, serious long-term complications are frequent. Adding further urgency is an annual 2-5% worldwide increase of T1D incidence over the past few decades, a phenomenon that can only be explained by altered environmental exposures and resultant interactions with genetic variants that predispose to T1D development. However, in contrast to genetic risk factors and autoimmune responses, the identities and pathogenic contributions of specific risk factors remain poorly defined. To address this shortcoming, we have developed a research plan that will provide the foundation for arguably the first ?exposure map? of the human pancreas in health and disease. In specific, we will use a combination of advanced immunohistochemistry (IHC) and laser-ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) to conduct an elemental biomaging analysis of healthy as well as pre-diabetic and recent onset type 1 diabetic pancreata. In Specific Aim 1, we will interrogate pancreatic tissue slides from healthy (non-diabetic) donors by IHC to identify microanatomical landmarks and tissue properties that will serve as geospatial referents for complementary LA-ICP-MS analyses that will reveal the identity, abundance and distribution of >20 essential elements and metal toxicants. In Specific Aim 2, we will conduct similar experiments with pancreatic tissues from pre-diabetic and T1D donors. Altogether, and as supported by our preliminary data, these analyses are expected to reveal definable patterns of essential element/metal toxicant distribution that co-localize with microanatomical structures and particular histological tissue properties, and therefore may provide initial evidence for the potential pathogenic involvement of selected metal toxicants or a combination thereof. For the efficient and cost-effective pursuit of these aims, we have established access to rare pre/diabetic and corresponding pancreatic control tissues through the Network of Pancreatic Organ Donors with Diabetes (nPOD), and we have developed a validated workflow for integrated IHC, LA-ICP-MS and advanced image analyses. Thus, we have created what we believe to be a promising conceptual and practical framework that may serve as an important foundation for future exposure analyses that seek to clarify aspects of T1D pathogenesis and to develop effective preventive treatment modalities."
"9424161","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Significant neurodevelopmental delay is emerging as one the most important current challenges for patients with congenital heart disease (CHD). Clinical studies demonstrate that reduced oxygen delivery due to CHD in utero results in subnormal brain development. Newly-developed brain injury after cardiac surgery is also common in neonates whose brains are already dysmature at the time of surgery. However no treatment options are currently available for brain damage in children with CHD. Our series of studies show that potential cell-based interventions for improvement of CHD-induced brain damage include: 1) promoting white matter (WM) regeneration through endogenous oligodendrocyte progenitors; 2) restoring the neurogenic potential of subventricular zone (SVZ) neural stem/progenitor cells; and 3) controlling prolonged microglia activation after cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB)-induced insults. Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) are multipotent, nonhematopoietic cells that possess both immunomodulatory and regenerative properties, and can treat a wide range of diseases including hypoxic brain injury. Various rodent studies have shown that in the brain MSCs: 1) accelerate WM remyelination through the activation of endogenous oligodendrocyte progenitors; 2) promote neurogenesis from SVZ neural stem/progenitor cells; and 3) regulate microglia activation after hypoxic-ischemic brain insults. Multiple clinical trials have also established the safety of MSC-based therapy. These findings have led to our principal hypothesis that: MSC delivery to the early postnatal brain promotes endogenous regeneration of damaged neuronal and glia cells in children with CHD. Pediatric cardiac surgery provides a unique opportunity to control cerebral perfusion of the developing brain though CPB. We are proposing the use of CPB itself as a new MSC delivery system in the CHD population. The proposed project will test the following specific related hypotheses: 1) MSCs govern CPB-induced systemic inflammation and reduce microglia activation in the brain (Aim 1); 2) MSC delivery accelerates WM regeneration through activation of endogenous oligodendrocyte progenitors (Aim 2); 3) MSC treatment promotes cortical regeneration through activation of endogenous SVZ neural stem/progenitor cells (Aim 3). Using our unique porcine hypoxia and CPB model, we will determine: 1) the systemic effect of MSC delivery through CPB during CHD surgery (Aim 1); 2) the effect of MSC treatment on WM oligodendrocyte progenitors (Aim 2); and 3) the effect of MSC treatment on SVZ neural stem/progenitor cells (Aim 3). The goal of the project is to design novel cell-based therapies aimed at regenerating damaged neural and glial cells, and improving neurodevelopment in children with CHD. Since the cellular/anatomical structure and developmental process of the piglet brain closely resemble their human counterpart, the results will also assist in providing new regenerative approaches to a wide variety of perinatal hypoxic/ischemic brain damages."
"9395939","US Hispanics/Latinos are the largest US minority group, constituting over 15% of the US population and growing to one-third of the US population by 2050. Hispanics match or exceed any other race-ethnicity group in having a high burden of diabetes and pre-diabetes. Especially given the relatively young age of US Hispanics, the group with prediabetes (e.g.,fasting plasma glucose 100-125 mg/dl) are of immense public health importance because 15-30% of people with prediabetes will develop diabetes within five years. Physical activity (PA) is an effective preventive behavior in the battle to prevent diabetes as suggested by the Diabetes Prevention Program. In this context, the Hispanic population presents a paradox. Particularly among males, Hispanics have higher moderate-to-vigorous activity levels than non-Hispanics and light intensity PA is higher and sedentary behavior (SB) is lower among Hispanics than other groups. There is also an apparent contradiction (Hispanic paradox) between a high risk of prediabetes/diabetes among Hispanics, while at the same time Hispanics have favorable mortality rates vs. others and may also have lower incidence of cardiovascular disease (CVD). The present application will leverage the Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latino Hispanics as well as the Framingham Heart Study (FHS) Third Generation and Omni Gen 2 (FHS Gen3/Omni2) cohorts of multiple race/ethnic groups. This approach not only increases generalizability of our findings to the US mainstream population, but also helps us understand what is unique about Hispanics. In all, 5500 individuals with confirmed prediabetes will be studied, all of whom had 7-day baseline Actical accelerometry measurements (2008-2011) which will be repeated during 2017-2020. This approach will allow us to understand the relationship among PA, SB, onset of diabetes and CVD in a large, representative population study of prediabetics."
"9403933","PROJECT SUMMARY Phosphorylation related perturbations in cellular signaling pathways are at the root of many human diseases. Protein phosphorylation cannot be observed using DNA or RNA sequencing, which means it is extremely important to develop proteomic technologies and methods that reproducibly and accurately quantify phosphorylation events. Tandem mass spectrometry currently provides an excellent platform to deeply catalog the sites of phosphorylation with respect to disease. However, accurate reproducibility and quantitation are hampered by several acquisition tradeoffs made to provide higher identification rates of low-abundant molecules. I propose an approach to improve quantitative reproducibility in phosphorylation experiments, specifically with regard to positional phosphorylation isomers. I intend to build computational tools that separate the tasks of peptide identification and site localization in proteomic workflows. I will perform site localization using several metrics calculated with entire fragment ion profiles made up of multiple scans, instead of current methods that only use a single scan to localize phosphorylation sites. This should significantly improve accuracy and reproducibility. I will apply this technique to monitor phosphorylation events in the IGF-1 signaling pathway of human cell lines with respect to various stimuli to help elucidate specific networking characteristics between members of that pathway. This project will also greatly benefit the signaling community by providing tools and methods to more reliably discover quantitative changes in the phosphoproteome.  "
"9609575","Abstract  The present research will explore and develop a transgenic approach to producing a bioluminescent reporter strain of Syrian hamster that will be a valuable tool for circadian research. The tau hamster was the first mammalian period mutant to be discovered. Transplantation experiments using tau hamsters established that suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) regulates the daily scheduling of physiology and behavior. Discovery that tau is a gain of function of casein kinase 1? was critical to achieving an understanding of the operation of transcriptional-translational feedback loops that generate circadian rhythms, both in the brain's pacemaker and in peripheral oscillators. We recently discovered duper, a new mutation in hamsters which, like tau, speeds up the circadian clock. Duper is not a change in the coding region of casein kinase or any other known clock gene, and the mutation does not affect clock speed in fibroblasts. Thus duper is unlikely to affect the TTFL, but more probably alters coupling relationships within the SCN. Duper causes a striking reduction in jet lag. Our experiments will validate the reporter strain by comparing luminescent traces with results from qRT-PCR. We will then compare the impact of the tau and duper mutations on circadian rhythms in order to determine whether shortening of period through effects on the pacemaker vs alterations in the TTFL have different consequences for organismal function.  Although hamsters have provided a valuable model for studies of biological rhythms, their potential as a genetic tool has yet to be realized. We have recently contributed to the first draft of the hamster genome and established methods for making transgenic hamsters. We have employed piggyBac methodology to insert circadian reporters into a hamster cell line. This technology will now enable us to study organismal function. In the first application of the reporter strain, we will determine effects of duper upon the core cell-autonomous feedback loops and upon the coordination of pacemaker function. This will shed light on the mechanisms of circadian desynchrony. Unlike the species in which transgenic reporter strains have thus far been produced, hamsters have a particularly regular, circadian-based estrous cycle and a strong photoperiodic response. Thus development of the hamster reporter strain will make possible future applications to investigate neuroendocrine function. Finally, the importance of the hamster as a disease model for several pathologies including MERS and Ebola, and the relevance of jet lag to the incidence of disease in an era of frequent trans-meridian travel, indicate that the reporter strain will be of widespread utility. Given the importance of circadian organization in behavior and physiology, this research will reveal mechanisms that underlie neurologic diseases, sleep deficiencies and metabolic disorders, and lead to development of new therapies."
"9405402","The mission of the Neuro-Oncology Program is to improve the standard of care for brain cancers. The Program features a broad portfolio of research initiatives in the general clinical disciplines (medical, radiation and surgical oncology) and in therapeutically relevant scientific areas (e.g. oncolytic viruses, signal transduction, angiogenesis, tumor immunology). For this CCSG renewal, we will focus on astrocytomas ? the most lethal brain tumor of adults and the most common brain tumor of childhood. We have four specific aims: Aim one is to determine why adult gliomas are unresponsive to signal transduction antagonists that are 1) genetically indicated, 2) brain-penetrant, and 3) effective in other cancers. Aim two is to adapt emerging tools of immunotherapy to the treatment of adult gliomas. Our study plan addresses an important unmet need in this area - namely a broader portfolio of antigenic targets for glioma. We will explore a whole exome sequencing approach (NeoVax) that generates synthetic peptide vaccines corresponding to novel open reading frames encoding cell surface proteins on tumor cells. Aim three addresses IDH mutant gliomas in young adults. Our preclinical work, together with early clinical data, suggests that effects of the oncometabolite R-2HG in glioma will, unlike leukemia, not be reversible on a clinically relevant time-scale. Our study plan draws upon new imaging techniques for visualizing R-2HG in IDH mutant glioma patients and a synthetic lethal approach to drug development based upon actionable metabolic changes that arise as a consequence of IDH1 mutation. Aim four is to develop targeted therapeutics for pediatric gliomas. Activating mutations of the serine/threonine protein kinase BRAF are found in 70-75% of pediatric low-grade astrocytomas (PLGAs). Our study plan addresses the unmet need for effective brain-penetrant RAF inhibitors for PLGA.  The Program is led by Tracy Batchelor MDMGH and Charles Stiles, PhDDFCI. At the time of the last CCSG renewal in 2011 it received a merit score of ?outstanding to excellent?. There are 94 members in the Program drawn from all seven DF/HCC member institutions. Collectively, the members receive over $31 million per year in cancer-relevant funding. Of this total research support package, $11.6 million is NCI funding and another $8.4M is from other peer-reviewed sources including NINDS (which, in a unique relationship, shares the burden of brain cancer research with NCI). The remaining $12M is from non peer-reviewed sources. One prominent component of the support package is a SPORE/P50 grant on glioma, newly awarded since the last CCSG renewal in 2011. Another important grant is a P01 on pediatric astrocytoma - one of just two P01s, nation-wide focused exclusively on pediatric brain cancer. During the project period, Neuro- Oncology Program members generated over 1,000 publications. Of these, 25% were inter-institutional, 26% were intra-programmatic, and 31% were inter-programmatic collaborations between two or more DF/HCC members. Overall, when counted once, 27% of DF/HCC publications were inter-programmatic collaborations."

Treatments  will increasingly be tailored to an individual's genomic constitution and genomic characteristics of their tumor,  mitigating toxicity and enhancing efficacy through individually tailored treatment and precise targeting of the  mutations that drive tumor propagation. We have developed a comprehensive program that includes: (i)  utilizing diverse experimental organisms from yeast, worm and mouse, to cell-based systems and ultimately  human populations with the overarching goal of identifying mechanisms that result in genomic changes and the  specific lesions responsible for cancer phenotypes; (ii) use of Whole Genome, Whole Exome and Whole  Transcriptome Sequencing (WGS/WES/WTS) as effective diagnostic tools; (iii) facilitating the effective use of  genomic information by patients and providers through structured categorization of genomic variation based  upon clinical validity and utility; (iv) a state-of-the-art informatics approach that incorporates generation,  analysis, and management of genomic data with coupling of genomic and clinical information to drive both  clinical testing and translational research; (v) development of ethical and practical policies for the use of WGS  data by both patients and clinicians; and (vi) exploration of massively parallel sequencing in a public health  context through sequencing of selected, highly actionable genes in members of the general population for  cancer-prevention purposes.  Our vision has been realized through value added LCCC resources for strategic recruitment of faculty in  emerging fields, investment in cutting-edge technology, enhanced organizational capability for integrative  analysis and the securing of significant federal funding to enable the application of genomics to diverse  aspects of cancer care and prevention. This unified and integrated effort ensures that insights gained through  basic research do not linger in the lab but will lead directly as possible to application in humans. Such an  integrated approach is critical for understanding the genesis, progression, and treatment of cancer.  There are 29 program members from 10 different departments (6 departments in the School of Medicine, 2 in  the School of Public Health, 2 in the College of Arts and Sciences). During the last funding period, program  members have published 627 cancer-related articles (36% collaborative). In 2014, our program members held  51 grants and $25.7 (total cost) in annual extramural funding, including 12 grants and $4.7M (total costs) from  the NCI."
"9390054","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our Program Project Grant (PPG), New Molecules in Triglyceride Metabolism and Adipogenesis, is guided by a unifying theme-to understand mechanisms for triglyceride delivery to peripheral tissues, triglyceride synthesis, and adipogenesis. The topic of this PPG is highly relevant to obesity and hyperlipidemia, two public health problems that are central to the mission of the NHLBI.   Working as a team over the past 5 years, the Project and Core Leaders of this PPG have studied new molecules with crucial roles in triglyceride delivery to cells, triglyceride synthesis within cells, and adipogenesis. These studies identified new regulators of lipid metabolism and adipogenesis and have uncovered new causes of human disease. For the next 5 years, our PPG team will be guided by the same objective-to understand the mechanisms underlying obesity and metabolic disease.   This PPG is organized into three Component Projects and two Cores. Project 1, Function of GPIHBP1 in Triglyceride Metabolism, will be led by Dr. Stephen G. Young. This project focuses on a novel endothelial cell protein, GPIHBP1, and its role in plasma triglyceride metabolism and the delivery of lipid nutrients to adipose tissue, heart, and skeletal muscle. Project 2, Lipin Protein Family Interactions, Lipid Intermediates, and Disease, will be led by Dr Karen Reue. Dr. Reue's discovery of the lipin family of enzymes set the stage for new studies on the regulation of triglyceride synthesis and the control of adipogenesis. Project 3, Novel Pathways for Triglyceride Storage and Adipogenesis, will be led by Dr. Peter Tontonoz. Dr. Tontonoz identified new molecules controlling lipid metabolism and adipogenesis, including TLE3 and IDOL (inducible degrader of the LDL receptor). Dr. Tontonoz will decipher mechanisms by which these new players in lipid metabolism affect adipogenesis. A Mouse Model and Protein Expression Core (Core A) will create new lines of genetically modified mice and will produce purified proteins for biochemical studies and antibody production. An Administrative Core (Core B) will facilitate the efforts by all three Component Projects, organize advisory board meetings, and ensure compliance with institutional and NIH guidelines."
"9471517","PROJECT SUMMARY Immune signaling plays an important role in initiation of inflammatory responses, resolution of acute tissue damage, and adaptation to chronic stress. Although inflammatory pathways responding to pathogens are well characterized, mechanisms mediating metabolic adaptation to cope with energy demands of various immune functions have just been realized in recent years. Upon activation by inflammatory stimuli, macrophages display a shift in energy utilization in favor of aerobic glycolysis with a diversion of pyruvate toward lactate production and away from further oxidation by mitochondria (known as the Warburg effect). Increased glucose uptake supports the acute energetic needs of activated macrophages. While the adaptation in energy metabolism (in part, regulated by Hif-1?) is essential to mount an effective pro-inflammatory response, this process also rapidly dampens mitochondrial respiration, which may lead to a progressive energy deficit. Consequently, increased macrophage dysfunction and death has been associated with severe sepsis and poor disease outcome in rodent models and humans. Currently, little is known concerning mechanisms that restore mitochondrial metabolic function in inflammatory macrophages and whether this is necessary to limit inflammatory dysfunction. Preliminary results show that in the macrophage pro-inflammatory stimuli, such as acute LPS treatment or Ifn?-primed, chronic LPS challenge (or M1 activation), induce the expression of Bmal1, a master regulator of circadian rhythm. Using myeloid-specific Bmal1 knockout (M-Bmal1KO) mice, our results suggest that this ?resetting? of the molecular clock following inflammatory stimulation facilitates the restoration of mitochondrial oxidative metabolism and cellular function. In addition, Bmal1 physically and functionally interacts with Hif-1?. We will test the hypothesis that crosstalk between Bmal1 and Hif1? serves as a molecular switch that controls energy utilization from glycolytic to oxidative metabolism in inflammatory macrophages. Interestingly, both circadian regulation and Hif-1? accumulation in peripheral tissues are dysregulated in obesity and with age. Therefore, results derived from the research plan may have important implications in obesity- and age-related inflammatory dysfunction."
"9468721","PROJECT SUMMARY Complete and faithful replication of the genome is essential during every cell division cycle in order to maintain genome integrity and prevent disease. Replication forks frequently encounter obstacles such as DNA lesions, difficult to replicate sequences, and protein complexes bound to DNA (such as transcription machinery) that can impede their progress and the completion of DNA synthesis. A large number of proteins and protein complexes are involved in facilitating accurate and complete DNA replication and restoring proper chromatin architecture behind the replication fork. Defects in many of these processes lead to a failure to overcome these obstacles causing genome instability and disease. While most of the essential components of the eukaryotic replication machinery are known, many proteins that have roles in influencing the fidelity and efficiency of DNA replication remain to be identified and characterized. Obtaining a complete inventory of all the proteins that travel with the replication fork, including those involved in DNA replication, chromatin maturation, and the replication stress response, is required to fully understand how genome stability is maintained and what processes present at replication forks contribute to it. Aim 1 of this proposal will utilize iPOND (isolation of proteins on nascent DNA) to provide a comprehensive inventory of the replication fork proteome, and Aim 2 will employ biochemistry and cell biology to functionally characterize one of the novel replication fork associated proteins. The catalog of proteins associated with replication forks generated from these experiments will be a valuable resource for identifying functions of understudied proteins and has the potential to increase our understanding of human diseases."
"9391970","ABSTRACT ? Sequencing and Genomics (GEN) Shared Resource  The Sequencing and Genomics Shared Resource (GEN SR) is a ?super SR? that provides an integrated  platform of technology, expertise, education, and infrastructure creating an accessible environment for LCCC  researchers to design and undertake cutting edge genomics projects. This SR is led by a team of highly  experienced genomic biologists with proven track records in cancer-related research. The SR specializes in  five major technologies: Agilent Microarrays, Affymetrix Microarrays, Illumina bead array genotyping, NextGen  sequencing (Illumina, PacBio, and Ion Platforms) and RNAi screening for functional validation. These areas  are complemented by major LCCC investments in computational infrastructure and analysis. The SR provides  state-of-the-art equipment and specialized expertise to guide users through any and all stages of a project:  consultation, sample QC, data generation, and analysis. These services are being used by LCCC researchers  to understand fundamental cellular processes that contribute to cancer. For example, these facilities have  contributed extensively to the data generated at UNC as part of The Cancer Genome Atlas project.  Additionally, several groups are using these SRs to translate cancer genomic information into actionable  clinical data as part of the NCGENES and UNCseq projects. In addition to an increase in these translational  projects, we expect that the next five years there will be increased demand for integrative genomics projects  that generate data from a variety of sources and SRs and then, working with the Bioinformatics Shared  Resource teams, produce comprehensive analyses of tumor samples.  From the end of June 2013 to July 2014, the GEN SR was used by 96 LCCC members (85% of total use).  Since 2009 use of this combined facility has nearly tripled (measured in terms of grant and recharge dolla rs).  Highlights for the GEN SR during the last funding period include extensive expansion of our NextGen  sequencing services and automation of all array platforms, as well as relocation to a new shared facility space  custom renovated to support the specific infrastructure required to run these systems 24/7. As a result, in  fiscal year 2013-2014 alone this SR made 13,303 genomic libraries, sequenced over 100 Trillion bp,  genotyped 1,945,409,504 SNPs, and ran 13,517 microarray experiments. This work has contributed to over a  hundred publications, including seven in Nature as part of The Cancer Genome Atlas project. For 2015, the  LCCC requests $254,659 to maintain personnel to support genomics efforts and offset service contract costs.  CCSG funds are projected to be 4% of operating costs."
"9391015","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Natural killer (NK) cells and their receptors have been gaining prominence in the HIV field as more connections to HIV acquisition, progression, and viral evolution are being uncovered. One early finding in the field was that HIV-1-infected patients possessing the activating NK cell receptor KIR3DS1 and certain HLA class I alleles have a significantly slower progression to AIDS. Subsequent research has shown that KIR3DS1 triggers NK cell-mediated killing and cytokine production, and work from our group has demonstrated that KIR3DS1- expressing NK cells in co-culture with HIV-1-infected CD4+ T cells have a superior ability to suppress viral replication when certain HLA class I alleles are present. However, no one has been able to show an isolated interaction between KIR3DS1 and HLA class I. This has hampered our mechanistic understanding of how KIR3DS1 confers protection in HIV-1 pathogenesis and leaves open many possibilities as to what is triggering and interacting with KIR3DS1. Thus, the present goal of this study is to discover the KIR3DS1 ligand. To this end, we will implement a battery of unbiased, innovative, and complementary molecular biological and cellular immunological approaches - including use of soluble fusion constructs, reporter cells, and immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry - to robustly identify the KIR3DS1 ligand. In addition, we aim to determine the cellular conditions that induce the expression of KIR3DS1 ligands in HIV-1 and other disease settings in which KIR3DS1 has been shown to be involved (e.g. other viral infections, cancer, autoimmunity, transplantation). This wil provide mechanistic insights as to how NK cell function is regulated through KIR3DS1:ligand interactions and, ultimately, elucidate how KIR3DS1 is able to slow HIV-1 disease progression, providing a new basis for NK cell-centered immunotherapeutic strategies that can help treat or control HIV/AIDS."

"9424285","Heart surgery for both coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) and transplantation often involves cardiac ischemia/reperfusion (I/R), which leads to a switch of the myocardial energy source from fatty acid ?- oxidation to anaerobic glycolysis. As an adaptation, Glut-4, a major isoform of the glucose transporters in the heart, is recruited to the cardiomyocyte surface (also called sarcolemma) to take up glucose and stimulate cardiac ATP production. Nonetheless, such compensatory Glut4 translocation is not sufficient to meet cardiac glucose demands for ATP generation in I/R hearts and thereby, results in an energy crisis. Notably, recent multiple large clinical trials involving infusion of glucose-insulin-potassium (GIK) solution into patients undergoing cardiac surgery have not shown any positive results (or even worse). Therefore, exploring how to augment Glut-4 translocation and glucose utilization, independent of insulin, is desperately needed to counter I/R-triggered cardiac energy loss. We recently made the novel findings that the tumor susceptibility gene 101 (Tsg101), a central component of the ESCRT (endosomal sorting complexes required for transport) machinery, is able to regulate the endosomal recycling of membrane receptors in animal hearts. Our newest data further showed that: 1) Tsg101 binds directly to Glut-4 in adult mouse hearts; 2) forced expression of Tsg101 in cultured myocytes resulted in higher levels of sarcolemma Glut-4 and improved cell survival when challenged with hypoxia/reoxygenation; and 3) Tsg101 up-regulates the expression of Rab11a and FIP3 (Rab11-family interacting protein 3), two key factors involved in endosomal recycling. Most importantly, our pilot data also showed that a group of naturally-occurring nano-vesicles, exosomes, released by bone- marrow stem cells, can effectively deliver Tsg101 into cardiac myocytes. Based on these initial findings, we hypothesize that Tsg101 can reduce or prevent cardiac I/R-induced energy crisis/injury by promoting Rab11a/ FIP3-mediated endosomal recycling of Glut-4. Treatment of mouse hearts with Tsg101-containing exosomes before ischemia or during early reperfusion can elevate myocardial Tsg101, thereby limiting I/R-triggered cardiac damage. The work proposed here will address three specific aims: 1) Define the role of Tsg101 in glucose-dependent energy generation and cardio-protection from I/R injury, using both heart-specific Tsg101-overexpressing and inducible knockdown mouse models; 2) Identify whether Tsg101-induced cardio-protection is dependent on Rab11a/FIP3-mediated endosomal recycling of Glut-4; and 3) Investigate the therapeutic potential of Tsg101 to prevent/reduce I/R-induced cardiac energy stress and injury, using Tsg101-loaded exosomes. The proposed studies are expected to identify Tsg101 as a novel regulator of Glut-4 translocation and as a major cardio-protector against I/R-induced energy stress. If verified, the findings from this proposal should provide new and safe strategies to increase energy generation in I/R hearts and hopefully, minimize surgically induced cardiac I/R injury."
"9434002","PROJECT SUMMARY Around 46% of the World's population lives in risk of contracting a mosquito-borne disease. Our overall goal is to produce mosquito pathogens that can effectively suppress vector borne diseases, and to this end we have engineered the mosquito pathogenic fungus Metarhizium pingshaense (Mp) to specifically deliver insecticidal proteins into mosquito blood. These genetically modified pathogens achieve fast kill at low spore dosages to block malaria transmission. The present challenge is to convert this promising strategy into a validated public health intervention by resolving outstanding issues related to the release of genetically modified organisms. Host specificity is a critical issue in any form of biological control, and a common critique is that introduced biocontrol agents may evolve to attack non target species. The likelihood of such evolution depends on the number of genes involved, how they interact, and the time scale at which host shift events happen. There is currently a dearth of information overall on determinants of host range for most pathogen-host systems, even though specificity and host shifts are of great concern for human, plant and animal health. Fortuitously, mosquito pathogenic Mp strains are an ideal model system as they have close relations that are broad spectrum generalist pathogens, while other lines have specialized to other insects (beetles, other flies etc). To preemptively identify and address concerns about the possibility of mosquito pathogen host shifts, we propose to compare genomes of 14 generalist and specialist strains and analyze correlations between gene divergence and host acceptance. This will: 1) provide the first characterization of the armamentarium of mosquito specific Mp strains; 2) greatly increase our knowledge of the genetics of host specificity; 3) define time lines for host shifts and the appropriate evolutionary distances for addressing various risks; 4) provide a much needed model for how new diseases originate, and 5) provide a timely new approach to risk assessment of biological agents (genetically modified or not) that accounts for past evolutionary host range changes when predicting future evolutionary changes.  4) enable scientists from a developing country to become directly involved in evaluating the potential use and application of transgenic microbes for future disease control."

This is achieved by  providing UNC Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center members with a centralized, coordinated, quality-  controlled, quality-assured facility for the procurement, processing, storage, and distribution of biologic  specimens. The facility procures biologic specimens for biobanking purposes utilizing its own IRB-approved  protocols. In addition, the facility now serves over 75 investigator-initiated IRB approved protocols, with both  blood and tissue being collected Additional services include consultation on biospecimen collection issues,  execution of pilot studies, assay development, and help with grant and publication submissions. The facility is  staffed with experienced personnel with over 30 years of combined tissue procurement, biospecimen  processing, nucleic acid extraction, and biorepository lab experience. The TPFB shared resource has a long-  term relationship with the Department of Surgical Pathology, such that most requests for research tissues are  routed through the core to insure that each project has undergone the appropriate IRB review. This has  resulted in a smooth and seamless centralized collection process for the banking of solid tissues, both fresh  and frozen, and blood products. All aspects of sample processing are tracked from the time the technician is  paged to retrieve the sample to arrival in the lab, through all processing steps, storage location, and ending  with distribution. In the last funding period, the tumor procurement and biospecimen processing efforts of the  facility resulted in over 60 high impact cancer-related publications. The total operating budget of the facility is  $1,001,303 of which we are requesting $299,303 from the CCSG. The previous budget $891,328 for which  CCSG support was 22% resulted in >200,000 specimens collected from 3600 unique cancer patients."
"9403209","Summary. Red blood cell (RBC) alloimmunization remains a significant clinical problem in transfusion medicine, particularly among those patients who require chronic transfusions. For those who are unfortunate enough to generate multiple alloantibodies, provision of compatible antigen negative RBCs can be both time and resource intensive. In rare cases, this can result in an inability to locate an otherwise life-saving therapy. RBC alloantibodies are also responsible for hemolytic transfusion reactions (HTRs), causing substantial morbidity and occasional mortality. HTRs result from two important immunological phenomena. The first is the uniquely evanescent nature of RBC antibodies, whose rapid disappearance leads to false negative screens in alloimmunized patients. The second is the recall antibody response elicited by re-exposure to antigen via subsequent transfusion, where the rapid and robust increase in circulating antibodies drive HTRs. Despite the significant clinical consequences of these phenomena, our understanding of the fundamental molecular and cellular mechanisms regulating anti-RBC antibody generation, maintenance and recall is remarkably limited. Accordingly, there are no effective therapeutic interventions available to alloimmunized patients other than antigen avoidance. Our previous work has identified IL-6 as a key cytokine signal that regulates both the initial alloimmunization response to RBCs as well as early T follicular helper cell (TFH) differentiation. We are now interested in extending our findings to investigate the role of IL-6 signals in controlling RBC alloantibody evanescence and recall responses. Given the pleomorphic nature of IL-6 signaling, we are interested in determining both the cellular targets (B vs. T cell), downstream signaling molecules (STAT3), and cellular consequences (short-lived plasma cell, long-lived plasma cell, memory B cell and memory TFH cell differentiation) regulated by IL-6 and required for RBC alloimmunization. Accordingly, we will employ cutting-edge conditional genetic mouse mutants of IL-6R, STAT3, and BCL6 to directly compare antibody and cellular responses to two different mouse models of RBC alloimmunization as well as standard vaccination approaches. In so doing, we will better understand how the fundamental cellular and molecular immune regulators of RBC alloimmunization vary for different RBC antigen systems, and also how they compare to traditional immune stimulation. Furthermore, we will develop a pre-clinical mouse model system to determine the therapeutic efficacy of targeting the IL-6/IL-6R signaling pathway for the prevention and/or treatment of RBC alloimmunization, serving as key data for the subsequent consideration of IL-6R antibody blocking therapies (such as Tocilizumab) in select, high-risk alloimmunized patients."
"9391991","ABSTRACT  The goal of the Cancer Epidemiology Program is to study environmental, genetic, and molecular risks for  cancer and cancer outcomes with an emphasis on disparities. Because we are a public comprehensive cancer  center and because North Carolina in many ways mimics the American population, the Program addresses  these important questions through multidimensional North Carolina population-based and hospital-based  studies. Notable translational cross-program research and high impact publications have been obtained in an  inter-disciplinary manner with members of the cancer control and prevention, clinical, genetics, breast, cancer,  cell biology and other programs. Program members conduct research with great impact, including population-  based studies in breast, colon, prostate, and head and neck cancer, throughout our catchment area (the state  of North Carolina) and at UNC Hospital; and the program is focused on cancer health disparities, especially  black-white differences. This innovative research model successfully integrates classic risk factor  epidemiology, molecular and genetic epidemiology, tumor biology, clinical factors, and prospective follow-up  for outcomes. For example, the Program?s Carolina Breast Cancer Study has reshaped our understanding of  disparities in breast cancer risk factors, tumor biology, and mortality among African-American women. New  and novel North Carolina-based studies in bladder, head and neck, and kidney cancer are planned. Program  members collaborate in national and international consortia and with other cancer centers. The Program brings  value to the Center through population- and hospital based studies that include systematic collection of  exposure, outcome data, and biospecimens, a unique shared resource (Rapid Case Ascertainment), and its  expertise in epidemiologic methods development and application. The Program effectively obtains value from  the center through UNC Lineberger?s strong support for faculty recruitments, extensive support for important  shared resources and developmental funds, which members leverage. The UNC Lineberger strategic plan  emphasis on optimizing cancer outcomes in North Carolina led to significant investment across the population  sciences including significant faculty recruiting. CE recruited 11 new program members both nationally-  recognized senior investigators and promising junior faculty.  There are 23 members from 7 different departments in the Schools of Public Health and Medicine and the  College of Arts and Sciences. During the last funding period, program members have published 629 cancer-  related articles (38% collaborative). In 2014, our program members held 53 grants and $13M (total cost) in  annual extramural funding, including 25 grants and $6.6M (total costs) from the NCI."
"9395942","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Necroptosis (programmed necrosis) is a newly defined cell death pathway that contributes to the pathology of vascular diseases like atherosclerosis and abdominal aortic aneurysms. However, the causes of endothelial cell necroptosis and its impact on vascular integrity are unknown. The applicant's lab recently generated mice with vascular deletion of the chromatin-remodeling enzymes CHD4 or BRG1 and found that these mutants die at midgestation from endothelial cell necroptosis and vascular rupture. Importantly, transcripts of the necroptosis executor gene Ripk3 were upregulated in Chd4 and Brg1 mutant endothelial cells, and genetic reduction of Ripk3 rescued both mutants from vascular rupture. The objective of this proposal is to exploit these vascular Chd4 and Brg1 mutants to define factors that promote embryonic endothelial cell Ripk3 transcription and necroptosis. The central hypothesis is that CHD4 and BRG1 respectively maintain embryonic blood vessel and lymphatic integrity by indirectly repressing Ripk3 transcripts and endothelial cell necroptosis. This hypothesis is based on the genetic data described above and on the applicant's preliminary evidence that CHD4 and BRG1 indirectly regulate Ripk3 transcription in cultured endothelial cells. Two specific aims will be employed to test the central hypothesis and to identify factors that directly trigger endothelial cell necroptosis. First, the applicant will determine how CHD4 regulates endothelial cell necroptosis in embryonic blood vessels. Cellular, molecular, biochemical, and genetic approaches will be used to test the working hypothesis that plasmin?which is aberrantly elevated in Chd4 mutant embryos?directly triggers Ripk3 transcription and necroptosis in blood vessel endothelial cells. Secondly, the applicant will determine how BRG1 regulates endothelial cell necroptosis in embryonic lymphatic vessels. Cellular and molecular approaches will be used to test the working hypothesis that BRG1 transcriptionally regulates the Ripk3 mRNA-destabilizing complex CCR4-NOT in lymphatic endothelial cells. In addition, Brg1 mutants will be used to identify the lymphatic endothelial cells most susceptible to RIPK3-mediated necroptosis during embryonic development. The proposed research is significant because it will define mechanistic causes and effects of endothelial cell necroptosis for the first time and will fundamentally advance the understanding of how this cell death program influences developmental vascular biology. The results of this work will also set the groundwork for elucidating how endothelial cell necroptosis impacts postnatal pathologies associated with cell death and vascular fragility."
"9459710","PROJECT SUMMARY Muscle injury is often accompanied by disruption of the muscle plasma membrane, and disruption of the muscle plasma membrane leads to muscle injury. The elongated nature of skeletal myofibers, while optimized for muscle contraction, places stress and strain on the sarcolemma through direct and lateral force transmission. Mutations in genes encoding dystrophin and its associated proteins are associated with a fragile plasma membrane that is more susceptible to rupture. Loss-of-function mutations in the dysferlin gene cause muscular dystrophy through abnormal muscle membrane trafficking, which includes defective sarcolemmal repair. An improved understanding of the membrane repair machinery of muscle will not only provide useful information for developing novel approaches to treat dysferlinopathies, but also will provide insight for muscle repair in many forms of muscle injury. Muscle injury occurs with disease, intense exercise, trauma, and surgery, and enhancing muscle repair may benefit each of these needs. Dysferlin, and the highly related myoferlin, are membrane-anchored proteins with multiple C2 domains, domains known to have protein and phospholipid binding properties. We used high-resolution microscopy and real time live imaging to define distinct subcomplexes within the sarcolemma repair machinery. The first subcomplex is the repair cap, which forms within seconds after membrane disruption. The repair cap is enriched for annexins, including annexins A6, A2, and A1. Immediately beneath this cap within the cytoplasm is an annexin-free zone enriched with filamentous actin. The repair cap is surrounded by a ring of shoulder proteins that include dysferlin, EHD proteins, BIN1 and others. The shoulder region is enriched for phosphatidylserine indicating the importance of phospholipid signaling for sarcolemmal repair. The repair cap and the shoulder ring are independent structures. We propose a model in which calcium and phospholipid signaling orchestrate the assembly of the repair complex in muscle by first organizing annexin caps. In this model, phospholipid signaling drives assembly of the ring of shoulder proteins, which requires their membrane-bending capacity. We will test this model of sarcolemmal repair using laser injury and high resolution imaging in isolated muscle fibers. We will also evaluate this model in the context of in vivo muscle disease and injury. The first aim will conduct experiments to delineate annexin assembly with focus on the role of calcium as a trigger for repair cap formation. The second aim concentrates on defining the role of dysferlin and its interaction with BIN1 and EHD proteins in forming the shoulder ring. The third aim outlines experiments to improve muscle membrane repair. These studies will decipher repair complex interactions with the goals of mitigating sarcolemmal injury and improving muscle repair."
"9445676","Project Summary  The signaling lipid sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) plays many roles in the immune response. Most notably, S1P regulates lymphocyte exit from lymphoid organs, where they are initially activated, into circulation, where they can travel to the site of infection. The concentration of S1P is higher in lymph than lymph nodes (LN). This gradient guides lymphocytes out of the LN into lymph and ultimately back to blood. Similarly, the high S1P within blood attracts lymphocytes to exit the spleen into circulation. T cells sense the S1P gradient primarily through the G protein-coupled receptor S1P receptor 1 (S1PR1). FTY720, a drug that targets four S1P receptors including S1PR1, became the first FDA-approved oral therapeutic for multiple sclerosis. By blocking lymphocyte exit from lymphoid organs, FTY720 prevents lymphocytes from accessing the central nervous system. Second-generation drugs that target S1PR1 have also shown promise in Phase II trials for psoriasis and colitis. Unfortunately, use of these drugs is limited because they also target S1PR1 in endothelial cells and cardiomyocytes, resulting in serious side effects. We recently found that the major facilitator superfamily transporter SPNS2 supplies S1P into lymph but not blood, making it a promising new drug target that would enable spatially specific modulation of S1P signaling. Blood S1P levels remain at about 80% of baseline in SPNS2-deficient mice, and these mice exhibit normal lung vascular permeability, unlike FTY720-treated mice. By contrast, S1P levels in lymph are dramatically reduced in SPNS2-deficient mice. In SPNS2-deficient mice, T cells exit the spleen into blood normally but cannot exit LN into lymph, leading to a redistribution of T cells from spleen to LN and a loss of circulating cells. We proposed that targeting SPNS2 could trap T cells in LN without substantial cardiovascular side effects. However, these studies were carried out in homeostasis, and the role of SPNS2 during inflammation or disease is poorly understood. Here, we will investigate how SPNS2 affects T cell function during the effector and memory stages of an immune response. First, we will address whether SPNS2 generates the lymph S1P that guides T cell exit from LN during an immune response, or whether in inflammation other transporters are upregulated and can compensate for SPNS2's loss. This is the key question to determine whether SPNS2 would be an effective drug target. Second, we will test the hypothesis that SPNS2 supplies S1P into the LN parenchyma during an inflammatory response, blunting the gradient that guides exit and slowing (but not halting) T cell transit through an inflamed LN. Third, we will determine whether SPNS2 regulates memory T cell differentiation and survival, extending our surprising finding that SPNS2/S1PR1 signaling regulates mitochondrial content and survival in naïve T cells. The proposed aims will test SPNS2's potential as a target for immunosuppressive therapy, and advance our basic understanding of the role of S1P in the immune response."
"9473452","Summary  Myocardial infarction (MI) causes regional dysfunction placing remote areas of the heart at a mechanical disadvantage resulting in long term adverse left ventricular (LV) remodeling and complicating congestive heart failure (CHF), which remains a leading cause of morbidity and death in the Western world. The current project will focus on evaluating and modulating the critical balance of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) and tissue inhibitors of matrix metalloproteinases (TIMP) which is known to play an important role during remodeling post-MI. A number of pharmacological and surgical therapies have been proposed to limit post-MI remodeling, including; the intramyocardial administration of biomaterials. These polymeric therapies have demonstrated mixed success in reducing infarct size, increasing angiogenesis, improving regional function, and limiting post-MI remodeling in pre-clinical studies, and have been recently translated to patients. We have established novel noninvasive hybrid SPECT/CT approaches for evaluation of changes in regional myocardial perfusion, angiogenesis, MMP activation, along with echocardiographic imaging approaches for quantitative evaluation of regional myocardial strain and ventricular remodeling. The current multi-PI proposal will focus on; 1) development of a novel imageable MMP-responsive theranostic hydrogel for post-MI therapy and tracking delivery and serial evaluation of hydrogel retention, 2) application of multimodality non-invasive anatomical, physiological and molecular imaging approaches for directing and evaluating the percutaneous intramyocardial delivery of MMP-responsive hydrogels, and 3) the evaluation of the mechanisms by which these injectable MMP-responsive hydrogels that release local TIMP alter myocardial mechanics and limit post- MI remodeling. We hypothesize that the intramyocardial delivery of MMP-responsive hydrogels that locally release TIMP-3 early post-MI will result in; 1) modulation of the local MMP-TIMP balance and the inflammatory response within the MI, 2) alteration of regional and global myocardial mechanics, 3) improvement in angiogenesis and myocardial perfusion, and 4) a reduction of adverse global post-MI remodeling. We also hypothesize that our multimodality imaging approach will facilitate optimal delivery of a theranostic hydrogel, and allow tracking of critical anatomical, physiological and molecular events, along with therapeutic efficacy. Accordingly, we propose to specifically: 1) development an imageable MMP-responsive theranostic hydrogels for post-MI therapy, 2) apply multimodality imaging to direct and evaluate percutaneous image-guided intramyocardial delivery these hydrogels using clinically relevant porcine models of post-MI remodeling, and 3) evaluate the mechanisms of therapeutic efficacy. The diagnostic and therapeutic approaches developed in the proposed project will be directly translatable to the management of patients following MI."
"9405394","Cancer Epidemiology Program Project Summary / Abstract The mission of the Cancer Epidemiology Program is to facilitate the conduct of epidemiological research and translation of those findings into prevention strategies to reduce the burden of cancer. A key goal of the Program is the integration of cancer epidemiology research across DF/HCC's clinical-based and discipline- based programs. The Program also is deeply invested in the mission of the training and mentoring of students and postdoctoral and clinical fellows that represent the next generation of cancer epidemiologists. To achieve these goals, the specific aims of the Program are to accelerate science, collaboration, translation and training of its members, in the following areas of research: (1) Primary and secondary precision cancer prevention; (2) Next-generation genomic epidemiology of cancer; (3) Epidemiological studies of metabolism and cancer; and (4) Epidemiological studies of cancer survivorship. The program has 71 members, representing six DF/HCC institutions and 14 academic departments. In 2014 peer-reviewed grant funding attributed to the Program was $22.6 million in total costs from the NCI and $2.3 million from other sponsors. During the current funding period, Cancer Epidemiology Program members published 1,417 cancer-relevant papers. Of these 41% were inter-institutional, 41% were intra-programmatic and 31% were inter-programmatic collaborations between two or more DF/HCC members. Overall, when counted once, 27% of DF/HCC publications were inter- programmatic collaborations."
"9389333","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant: As a cancer of endothelial origin that typically grows under the skin or mucous membranes, KS in AIDS patients mostly manifests as oral lesions. Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV), a member of the gammaherpesvirus subfamily of the Herpesviridae family, has been shown to be an etiologic agent of all forms of KS, primary effusion lymphoma and multicentric Castleman's disease. Central to pathogenesis and spread of KSHV is lytic replication, a process that begins with the assembly of capsids inside host cells and ends with the release of infectious virions into the extra-cellular space for viral propagation. Currently, no drugs specifically targeting lytic replication of KSHV are available and no atomic capsid structures are available needed for rational design of anti-viral drugs and vaccines against KSHV infection. By cryo electron microscopy (cryoEM) in 1999, PI Zhou's group published the first three-dimensional (3D) structure of KSHV capsid isolated from AIDS patient-derived BCBL-1 cells, followed by 7Å-resolution structures of the murine (with PI Sun) and rhesus monkey gammaherpesviruses, revealing molecular interactions among gammaherpesvirus capsid proteins. Recently, the two PIs' collaborative efforts with improved resolution (4.5Å) cryoEM and bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) mutagenesis of KSHV have mapped several important segments of the smallest capsid protein (SCP, ORF65) in cementing the major capsid protein (MCP) of KSHV. These structure results, together with published results from residue-scanning mutagenesis, have led to the hypotheses that the SCP-MCP interactions are vital to KSHV assembly and such interactions revealed in an atomic structure can be targeted for inhibitors against KSHV lytic infections. The studies described in this application will test the above hypotheses by taking advantage of technology breakthroughs in high-resolution cryoEM and KSHV BAC mutagenesis already established in the two PIs' labs. In Aim 1, we will determine the structure of KSHV capsid to ~3Å by cryoEM with the revolutionary direct electron counting technology. From this cryoEM map, we will derive an atomic model of the KSHV capsid and identify amino-acid residues within 6 Å of interacting capsid proteins - particularly those between SCP and MCP - i.e., residues vital to capsid assembly. In Aim 2a, we will refine our structural interpretation of interacting amino acids by correlating existing and new data from site-specific mutagenesis and assess their impact on capsid assembly. Next, key segments and specific bonds identified among SCP-SCP and SCP-MCP interactions will be targeted to design both dominant negative mutants (i.e., cell-expressed) and novel peptides (i.e., chemically-synthesized) to select potent inhibitors that can disrupt KSHV lytic replication (Aim 2b). Results from this research program will inform future development of therapeutics against KSHV infection and spread. The novel approach established will be generally applicable to other viruses and complexes."
"9393329","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Visual prostheses based on electrical stimulation of the retina are an effective approach for treating blindness in individuals with photoreceptor degenerative diseases (e.g., retinitis pigmentosa). The epiretinal strategy, which was pioneered by our team, involves implanting the stimulating electrodes near the inner retinal surface. Compared with other strategies, epiretinal implantation surgeries are easier and are at risk of fewer complications. Epiretinal stimulation electrodes consist of metallic micro-disks of platinum, iridium, or titanium and their oxides, embedded in a flexible insulating polymer substrate such as polyimide, parylene, or silicone elastomer. The electrode array can be monitored with funduscopy and removed or readjusted post-implantation with minimal surgery. Our experience with chronic implantation suggests that mechanical damage to the retina is a significant concern for epiretinal prosthesis patients with electrical stimulation. Furthermore, preclinical studies hae shown that prolonged electrical stimulation can damage the retina. However, detailed knowledge of how this damage manifests in retinal implant patients is currently lacking. Ocular imaging technologies available in the clinic, such as optical coherence tomography (OCT), are useful for patient monitoring but provide only limited information about retinal structure. Thus, there is a need for novel imaging modalities that can measure the fundamental mechanical properties of the retina over time in retinal prosthesis patients. The goal of this study is to develop and characterize novel tools for imaging the elastic properties of the retina under prosthetic electrical stimulation. To address this goal, we propose to use phase-resolved OCT to detect minute displacements induced by acoustic radiation force (ARF) in the retinal tissue layers. This will enable us to generate images depicting local displacements with nanometer resolution, providing details about the elastic properties of the retina that cannot be obtained with current imaging methods. We will also develop ultrasound (US) convex transducer arrays that can monitor retinal detachment and edema through the thin stimulating electrodes in areas where tissue damage is most likely to occur. We'll design and develop two convex single crystal arrays for imaging and an ARF transducer and integrated convex array ARF-optical coherence elastography (OCE) system that enables co-registered OCT, US, and ARF- OCE imaging; Model and measure the elastic properties of the retina with electrode array and conduct ex-vivo and in-vivo rabbit eye imaging to assess performance. Use ARF-OCE to detect retinal damage caused by mechanical stress and electrical stimulation."
"9393538","Project Summary: Pilot Project Component Alcohol use disorders (AUDs) are among the top modifiable factors leading to premature death. Reducing this burden will depend on a combination of changes in regulatory policy, preventive strategies such as health education and SBIRT, and treatment strategies aimed at interrupting the development of hazardous drinking and addiction. There is a critical need to promote the development of new investigators in alcohol research, and in attracting established investigators from other fields, to further these goals. The Pilot Project Component identifies promising investigators and provides pilot funding, mentoring, and collaboration with established alcohol investigators, with a goal of helping them accrue preliminary data leading to success in obtaining larger grants. A secondary goal is to explore areas of long-range relevance to the themes of the IARC. The flexibility inherent in a pilot project allows investigators to respond rapidly to unique scientific opportunities as they arise, and in this cycle we have emphasized the value to the pilot investigators of connecting their work to the themes of the Center (through shared expertise, techniques, and sample use).  "
"9406154","Project Summary The overall objective of the proposal is to lay the preclinical groundwork for first-in-human studies of biological pacemakers (BioP) as alternatives to electronic devices. Gene-based BioP were first described more than a decade ago; somatic gene transfer of various constructs (a dominant-negative mutant of the inward rectifier channel [Kir2.1AAA], wild-type HCN channels, and a transcription factor [Tbx18]) have all been shown to create BioP activity. However, until recently, in vivo preclinical applications have been mostly limited to highly- invasive models. We have developed a clinically-realistic minimally-invasive delivery technique and used it to create BioP in a porcine model of complete heart block. Here, we propose to use this approach to compare two ?finalist? therapeutic candidates with fundamentally different mechanisms of action. The first one is a wild-type ion channel (HCN2) that artificially induces automaticity in ventricular cardiomyocytes by functional re- engineering. The goal is not to create a faithful replica of a pacemaker cell, but rather to manipulate a single component of the membrane channel repertoire so as to induce spontaneous firing in an excitable but normally-quiescent cell. The active principle of the second therapeutic candidate, Tbx18, reprograms ventricular cardiomyocytes into sinoatrial node (SAN)-like pacemaker cells (induced SAN [iSAN] cells). No one determinant of excitability is selectively over-expressed: the entire gene expression program is altered, with resultant changes in fundamental cell physiology and morphology. The proposal utilizes the abovementioned percutaneous delivery method to refine and validate, in a large-animal model of bradycardia, the approaches required for translation to the clinic. We will characterize and compare the pacing efficacy and safety of HCN2 and Tbx18-derived BioP, testing the hypothesis that iSAN cells will provide superior chronotropic support as compared to HCN2. We will go on to perform long-term efficacy, toxicology and biodistribution studies with the more promising therapeutic candidate, and then prepare, and obtain approval of, an Investigational New Drug (IND) application for a first-in-human BioP trial. While the ultimate goal may be to render obsolete the electronic pacemaker, it is important to be realistic in thinking about potential first-in-human applications. Therefore, we have chosen to develop, initially, a bridge-to-device product that will temporarily provide hardware-free chronotropic support in infected patients who are pacemaker-dependent. To make BioP temporary, we deliver the genes in adenoviral vectors, relying on immunological clearance to limit bioactivity. Nevertheless, we will test catheter ablation of the BioP as a backup rescue strategy in case of persistent undesired BioP activity. This research proposal is designed to lay the groundwork for clinical testing of an optimized BioP initially in a needy population."
"9472473","~30,000 new cases of invasive lobular breast cancer (ILC) diagnosed per year make ILC the 6th most common cancer in women. ILC is treated almost identically to the more common invasive ductal cancer (IDC), despite differences in clinical presentation and tumor biology, including the near universal loss of E-cadherin. Although ILCs show better prognostic markers than IDC, such as high rates of estrogen receptor (ER) positivity and low proliferation, patients with ILC often develop resistance to endocrine therapy and in the long term suffer more recurrences than IDC. Our long-term goal is to improve outcome for patients with ILC, a disease associated with limited understanding and representing a great unmet clinical need. To understand mechanisms driving ILC endocrine resistance, we developed endocrine-resistant ILC cell line models, and collected endocrine resistant metastatic breast cancer samples, and unbiased transcriptomic profiling led to the identification of fibroblast growth factor receptor 4 (FGFR4) as the most overexpressed gene. Analysis of publicly available databases lead to identification of hotspot FGFR4 mutations. Lack of consistent overexpression of FGFR1-3 in endocrine resistant models and metastatic tissues strongly suggests a unique and previously unappreciated role for FGFR4 that warrants further study. While FGFR4 overexpression and mutations are observed in both IDC and ILC, they are significantly enriched in ILC. This suggests that the unique genetic background of ILC, including the well-known loss of E-cadherin but also the more recently identified activation of ERBB2/ERBB3, may provide a permissive environment for FGFR4 signaling. Functionally, FGFR4 loss or inhibition results in altered expression of ER target genes and decreased growth and colony formation. Finally, preliminary studies of combined FGFR4 and ER targeting confer synergistic growth inhibition. We therefore hypothesize that the unique genetic background of ILC creates a permissive environment for FGFR4 signaling to mediate endocrine resistance, and that the combination of FGFR4 inhibition and endocrine therapy represents a novel treatment strategy. In the current study, we will i) determine how FGFR4 causes endocrine resistance in breast cancer, and ii) examine whether key genomic features of primary and metastatic breast cancer cross-talk and enhance FGFR4 signaling and activity, and iii) credential FGFR4 as a druggable target in breast cancer therapy by defining biomarkers. Our collaborative team with expertise in molecular biology, biostatistics/bioinformatics, pathology and medical oncology will utilize unique models, valuable clinical samples, promising drugs that are already in trials, and innovative approaches and tools to test our focused hypotheses on a novel role of FGFR4 in endocrine resistance. We expect to gain fundamental knowledge of how the readily druggable ER-FGFR4 axis signals in ILC and!to assess FGFR4 inhibition as a novel treatment strategy in endocrine resistant breast cancers. !"
"9571441","ABSTRACT Bile acids are cholesterol-derived, natural surfactants, produced in the liver. They are critical to lipid digestion, antibacterial defense, and cholesterol synthesis, as well as other aspects of human biology. Importantly, bile acid dysregulation has been linked to intestinal bowel disease. Intestinal inflammation is modulated through a fine balance between the intestinal microbiota and the mucosal immune system. Imbalance can activate immune signaling pathways, leading to uncontrolled, pathological immune responses. Gut-residing bacteria in both the small and large intestines are exposed to a significant amount of bile acids and are known to convert host- derived bile acids into more hydrophobic, and thus, more bioavailable derivatives. We hypothesize that bacteria-produced secondary bile acids directly regulate the differentiation and/or function of key immune cells under inflammatory conditions, providing a communications link between commensal bacteria and mucosal immunity. We propose 1) to dissect the mechanisms of bile acid-mediated immune modulation and identify bile acid immune cell targets, 2) to identify bacteria and their enzymes that generate immune-modulatory bile acids and 3) to identify the novel metabolites of bile acids that regulate mucosal inflammation in vivo, at physiological concentrations. Elucidation of these mechanisms will not only provide novel therapeutic options for inflammatory diseases, but also open exciting avenues to study unique regulatory interactions between gut-residing microorganisms, small molecule metabolites and host immune cells."
"9439298","Project Summary/Abstract  Human Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph+) leukemias are induced by the BCR-ABL oncogene (P190 or P210) and include two distinct diseases: B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) and chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). Compare to CML that responds well to BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), BCR-ABL-positive B-ALL only has a short-lived therapeutic response to available TKIs and has a poor prognosis. B-ALL can be initially induced by P190BCR-ABL and advanced from chronic phase CML often induced by P210BCR-ABL. Less sensitivity of B-ALL to TKIs even in the absence of BCR-ABL kinase mutations suggests that there must be critical pathways whose activation by BCR-ABL is required for B-ALL development but cannot be completely shut down through a sole inhibition of BCR-ABL kinase activity by TKIs. It also suggests that TKIs do not completely eradicate B-ALL-initiating cells responsible for disease initiation and insensitive to chemotherapy. There is an urgent need for developing new therapeutic strategies synergistic with available treatments, aiming at targeting B-ALL-initiating cells to achieve a cure. In this regard, we have obtained preliminary results showing that arachidonate 15-lipoxygenase (Alox15) is a critical gene upregulated in B-ALL cells by BCR-ABL and required for B-ALL development in mice. In theory, B-ALL is derived from B-ALL-initiating cells, leading us to hypothesize that Alox15 represents a critical genetic pathway required for B-ALL and may serve as a target for eradicating B-ALL- initiating cells to more effectively treat B-ALL. Although we previously showed that Alox15 plays a role in BCR-ABL-induced CML, BCR-ABL-induced B-ALL is a distinct disease with a poor response to TKIs compared to CML. Also, BCR-ABL utilizes distinct signaling pathways or share some pathways but utilize them differently during leukemogenesis. More importantly, the role of Alox15 in human B-ALL is totally unknown. It will be critical and necessary to study the role of Alox15 in vivo using primary human B-ALL cells and to propose in-depth mechanistic studies to fully understand the Alox15 pathway that contributes to survival regulation of B-ALL-initiating cells, B-ALL development and TKI resistance. Therefore, we propose the following two specific aims are: 1) To study the role of Alox15 in survival regulation of B-ALL-initiating cells and in TKI resistance using mouse and primary human BCR-ABL-positive B-ALL cells; and 2) To dissect genetic pathways mediating Alox15 signaling and function in B-ALL-initiating cells and during B-ALL development. If successful, the results will have a huge impact on our understanding of human BCR-ABL- positive B-ALL for identifying novel targets in treating human B-ALL that still lacks effective therapies."

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application, Cellular regulation of the IL-22 receptor and its importance in lung immunity, is submitted by me, Dr. Nathaniel Weathington, MD PhD in the University of Pittsburgh Department of Medicine, Division of Pulmonary Allergy, and Critical Care Medicine for a mentored Career Development Award (K08). I have a strong background and commitment to research in pulmonary inflammation biology with aspirations to ultimately direct a center on lung inflammation biology. I propose a research-intensive period of career development with hands-on and didactic training integrated into the activities planned. To complete my primary research Aims, I will gain and extend expertise in protein chemistry, cell biologic, and animal model techniques. I present preliminary data on modulation of the interleukin (IL)-22 signaling axis, which is essential and protective for Type 17 immune responses. Molecular regulation of IL-22 receptor (IL-22R) protein levels is unknown, and I show that IL-22R is degraded by the ubiquitin (Ub) proteasome with identification of a molecular motif for IL-22R ubiquitination. I also observe that the uncharacterized Ub E3 ligase subunit FBXW22 shuttles the IL-22R protein for degradation in lung epithelial cells. Further, the multi-functional kinase glycogen synthase kinase 3? phosphorylates and stabilizes IL-22R in cells. Based on this, I propose to more specifically characterize IL-22R regulation, study abundance of involved proteins in human specimens for disease correlation, and test the hypothesis that stabilization of IL-22R in vivo can protect from pneumonia. My work will proceed under close advisement from my primary mentor and research advisors. I also propose select coursework for enrichment on translational science and personalized medicine. I have an environment of enduring support at the University of Pittsburgh from my advisors, mentor, division, and department, and will be promoted to Assistant Professor of Medicine on completion of my fellowship in summer 2014. With support from the K08 mentored Career Development Award, this project will yield publications and presentations, and I will develop my research to an independent project with a transition to independence and application for an R01 project award in the next five years."
"9442467","ABSTRACT Digital mammography (DM) combined with digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) has emerged as a promising primary breast cancer screening technology with improvements in specificity and sensitivity compared to screening with DM alone. However, the total radiation dose of a combined DM/DBT study is often twice that of screening with DM alone, raising concerns about the cumulative dose over a lifetime of screening. In 2013, the FDA approved synthetic ?2D-like? (s2D) images, derived from data acquired during the DBT acquisition, as a replacement for the conventional ?dose? DM imaging in DBT screening. Our preliminary single site data and early reader studies suggest that s2D/DBT screening may further reduce recall and biopsy rates compared to DM/DBT, while providing high invasive breast cancer detection rates but reduced detection of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). In addition, the mammographic density assignments from s2D/DBT screening changed significantly with less patients deemed ?dense?, which could impact risk assessment and density-based clinical decisions regarding supplemental screening since breast density notification is mandated by laws in more than half of US states. We propose a multi-center observational study with adequate power to comprehensively characterize multiple aspects of s2D/DBT screening performance. We will leverage a natural experiment at early adopter radiology facilities participating in the University of Vermont and University of Pennsylvania PROSPR Research Centers that have transitioned from DM/DBT to s2D/DM for routine screening. Our specific aims are 1) To determine the clinical screening performance (e.g., sensitivity and specificity) of breast cancer screening with s2D/DBT; 2) To evaluate the rates of specific malignant and benign lesions detected by breast cancer screening with s2D/DBT; and 3) To determine the distribution of mammographic breast density assessments on s2D/DBT exams. For all aims, we will compare s2D/DBT screening performance to the performance of DM/DBT screening at the same facilities prior to their adoption of s2D/DBT. We anticipate a sample size of approximately 86,000 s2D/DBT exams and 98,000 DM/DBT exams. The University of Vermont and University of Pennsylvania PROSPR Research Centers have prospectively collected breast cancer screening data since 2011 in a standardized fashion to permit pooled analyses. Our registries contain exam- level breast imaging common data elements, including high quality information on indication of exam (i.e., screening vs. diagnostic), mammographic views, assessments, and breast density, linked to pathology databases and statewide cancer registries thereby permitting investigation of both benign and malignant diagnoses. The results of this project will provide needed evidence for women evaluating screening options, providers assessing whether to adopt s2D/DBT, health care payers considering reimbursement rates, and policy makers debating breast cancer screening recommendations in the context of this new technology."
"9414965","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Since 1998, RAND has hosted a Mini-Medical School for Social Scientists (Mini-Med) in Santa Monica, California, motivated by the recognition that behavioral and social research on aging is better informed-and ultimately more useful-if it has a sound biomedical basis. Traditional training programs in the social sciences-such as economics, psychology, demography, and sociology-often steer clear of biomedical issues. While Mini-Med does not fully remedy this deficiency, it does expose young social scientists to biomedical issues to stimulate them to further investigate the complementarities between their research and the larger biomedical field. Mini-Med consists of a two-day series of lectures by national and international experts on diverse biomedical topics of interest to researchers in aging. The event is held with a second workshop on the demography, economics, and epidemiology of aging. Combining these two workshops both reduces organizational expenses and serves to attract scholars who might otherwise not attend either program. Past participants have included senior and junior faculty at universities, post-doctoral and pre-doctoral trainees in aging, and researchers from non-profit foundations and institutions. Past lectures have covered such diverse topics as the aging process, genetics, and biology, as well as specific conditions that affect the elderly such as cancer, dementia, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes. Each lecture emphasizes medical knowledge that would improve social science research on the elderly."
"9473234","SUMMARY Bordetella pertussis causes pertussis (whooping cough), which is a reemerging global public health threat.  In the 1940s an inactivated, whole-cell pertussis vaccine was introduced that dramatically reduced the mortality caused by pertussis. A new, potentially less toxic acellular vaccine was developed and introduced in the United States and other parts of the world in the 1990s. Although the acellular pertussis (aP) vaccine has fewer side effects, its protective efficacy is lower than that of the whole cell vaccine potentially due to the inability of aP to prevent nasopharyngeal colonization leading to transmission of B. pertussis.  Like many Gram-negative pathogens, Bordetella spp. possess a type III secretion apparatus (T3SA). It resembles a molecular syringe and needle and two protein complexes localize atop the needle: a tip protein and the first translocator protein. These proteins are required for pathogenesis of Bordetella spp. and are 95-98% conserved among Bordetella spp. We have previously fused the Shigella spp. T3SA tip and translocator proteins to create DBF, which was used to successfully develop a novel subunit vaccine antigen against Shigella spp. When administered intranasally (IN) or parenterally (IM), DBF, admixed with the mucosal adjuvant double-mutant labile toxin (dmLT) from Enterotoxigenic E. coli, protects mice against a lethal challenge by S. flexneri and the heterologous pathogens S. sonnei and S. dysenteriae.  We have similarly produced a fusion for Bordetella. In the initial mouse experiment the fusion protected 100% of the mice from a lethal pulmonary challenge with B. bronchiseptica, the causative agent of canine kennel cough. Furthermore, 38% sterilizing immunity was observed in the lungs despite the high bacterial load administered in the challenge.  Thus, we hypothesize that our fusion will elicit a robust immune response that protects against B. bronchiseptica and B. pertussis infection. Additionally, we hypothesize that the fusion will elicit sterilizing immunity in the respiratory tract to break the transmission chain. Thus, the specific aims of this investigation are: 1) Assess the respective humoral and cell-mediated immune responses elicited by the fusion delivered IN and IM and 2) Determine the protective efficacy of the fusion against B. bronchiseptica and B. pertussis challenge."
"9454870","Project Summary The long-term goal of this project is to develop a new class of safe and effective anti-malarial drugs to combat the emergence of resistance to existing treatment of Plasmodium falciparum infection. Our immediate objective is to discover novel small molecular inhibitors of the P. falciparum facilitative glucose transporter PfHT that can be used for subsequent lead optimization studies. Central to our strategy is the identification of compounds with selectivity for the plasmodium transporter over human facilitative glucose transporters (GLUTs). Based upon our established success in elucidating the structural basis for the effects of antiretroviral drugs in clinical use toward human GLUTs and knowledge of sequence homologies between parasite and human orthologues, we hypothesize that PfHT antagonists with high affinity and selectivity for this transporter can be identified. To test this hypothesis, we will utilize a high throughput screening approach combined with hit validation and in vitro testing for compound effects on human GLUTs. Inhibitor screening will be accomplished using a novel cell based assay that uses a FRET-based signal to detect changes in intracellular glucose levels. Hit compound selectivity for PfHT over human GLUT orthologues will be assessed in our unique HEK293 cell lines that over-express individual glucose transporters. Target validation will be performed in blood stage P. falciparum with measurement of compound effects on 2-deoxyglucose transport rates, parasite growth, and with resistance profiling. Taken together, this project will provide a solid foundation for subsequent in-depth characterization of lead compound structure-activity relationships, candidate drug optimization, and eventual human clinical trials."
"9416653","Melanoma Brain Metastasis (MBM) carries a dismal prognosis with a median overall survival of only 4-6 months. If patients develop leptomeningeal disease, the overall survival is even lower. The incidence of MBM has been reported to be up to 43% in clinical settings and up to 75% in the autopsy series. Although notions that Circulating Tumor Cells (CTCs) act as ?seeds? of intractable metastasis are established, there is no knowledge characterizing MBM-colonizing CTCs. Single-cell CTC transcriptional profiling has also demonstrated that CTCs isolated from patients are very distinct from cell lines that are widely used for drug discovery. This is even more compelling considering that significant discrepancies of biomarkers among CTCs and corresponding primary and metastatic tumors have been observed. Moreover, while the presence of CTCs in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) remains the gold standard, the sensitivity of cytology is only 50-56% at time of the first CSF analysis. Therefore, the development of effective therapy approaches - CTC-based tests - could have a tremendous clinical impact to treat MBM. We hypothesize that the neurotrophin receptor p75NTR and Heparanase (HPSE), two markers implicated in MBM models, are novel CTC biomarkers to predict clinical MBM and potential therapeutic targets to prevent MBM. The objective of this application is to demonstrate that the p75NTR/HPSE axis is diagnostic in clinical MBM; and that p75NTR and HPSE are novel therapeutic CTC targets to combat MBM. In aim 1, we will: a) isolate and characterize p75NTR/HPSE CTC subsets from blood and CSF (multiparametric flow cytometry and DEPArrayTM technologies among others), and compare the expression of p75NTR/HPSE combinations in CTCs of melanoma patients diagnosed either with or without MBM; b) directly link patient-isolated CTC subsets, possessing p75NTR/HPSE expression and combinations, to clinical MBM. In aim 2, we will assess effects of regulating functions of p75NTR/HPSE CTC subsets on MBM development by using small-molecule p75NTR and new HPSE inhibitors along with CTC xenografts; and complement these effects with regulatory p75NTR/HPSE gene expression (pINDUCER lentiviral toolkit). In aim 3, we will: a) determine roles of CTC-expressed Merlin as an important integrator of p75NTR/HPSE pathways altering CTC proliferation vs. growth arrest; b) delineate HPSE-induced, syndecan-mediated modulation of Merlin/Hippo signaling to affect CTC properties driving MBM. Uncovering MBM CTC phenotypes offers the opportunity to modify treatment by extending studies directly to human melanoma. This project lead by an inter-disciplinary and well-integrated team will study and validate new and specific CTC biomarkers responsible for CTC-induced MBM. It has high therapeutic impact and is paradigm- shifting. We are uniquely positioned to perform this study not only for having access to an extensive cohort of blood/CSF samples from melanoma patients but also for the extensive expertise interrogating the entire CTC spectrum by combining multiple and complementary CTC technologies unlike other groups in the country."
"9470612","PROJECT SUMMARY Maintenance of proteostasis is central to cellular fitness and is achieved through sophisticated protein quality control (PQC) pathways that remove dysfunctional or unwanted proteins and protein complexes that become cytotoxic if allowed to accumulate. In fact, protein aggregation encouraged by defects in PQC is a hallmark of aging, cancer, and numerous human ?aggregation-prone? pathologies, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Alzheimer?s, Parkinson?s, Huntington?s, and prion-mediated diseases. Consequently, fully understanding PQC could offer new strategies to mitigate protein aggregation and subsequent proteotoxic stress, especially as they relate to these disease states. Recently, ancient and mechanistically conserved PQC pathways were discovered that direct the autophagic elimination of unwanted or inactive proteasomes and ribosomes, termed proteaphagy and ribophagy, respectively. Notably, a selective proteaphagic route triggered by inhibition shares features with amyloidogenic protein removal, including sequestration by the Hsp42 chaperone, ubiquitylation, and subsequent recognition by the autophagic receptors Cue5 or RPN10, suggesting that inhibitor-induced proteaphagy, and likely ribophagy, offer tractable models to dissect features underpinning PQC and protein aggregate clearance. This project aims to characterize proteaphagy and ribophagy induced by inhibition in both Arabidopsis and yeast with the goal of discovering components central to autophagic PQC. Specifically, we will define how, where, and why the yeast ubiquitin (Ub) ligases Hul5, Rsp5, and San1 (and their Arabidopsis orthologs) recognize and ubiquitylate dysfunctional proteasomes, and how this modification triggers autophagy via the Ub-binding Cue5/RPN10 autophagic receptors, using facile confocal fluorescence microscopic and GFP-fusion cleavage assays together with co-localization studies. A special focus will be on the mechanism(s) involving Hsp42 that coalesce inactive proteasomes into large cytoplasmic aggregates similar to those observed for various aggregation-prone proteins. We will determine which proteasome subunits become modified, where the Ubs are attached, which types of poly-Ub chains are assembled, and identify other factors/post- translational modifications that might be important, by mass spectrometric analysis of proteasomes purified before and after inhibition. Using similar methodologies, we will examine how ribosomes are degraded by autophagy after exposure to translation inhibitors, and examine the role(s) of ubiquitylation and the corresponding ligases, Hsp42, and receptors like Cue5/RPN10 in this clearance. We will also confirm proteaphagy in human cells and the involvement of the Cue5 ortholog Tollip in this process, and determine if the pathway(s) used for proteophagy and ribophagy also help clear amyloidogenic proteins. Finally, we will study a new class of autophagic receptors related to RPN10 that might substantially expand the influence of selective autophagy in plants, yeast, and humans. Through this cumulative research, we will define the autophagic routes for proteasome and ribosome clearance that should be relevant to aggregation-associated PQC, and thus will shed light on the roles of various subcellular protein deposits and their effectors in mitigating proteotoxic stress related to numerous aggregation-prone pathologies."
"9405366","Overall Project Summary / Abstract Now in its 17th year of operation, Dana-Farber/Harvard Cancer Center (DF/HCC) was the first consortium model, NCI-designated Comprehensive Cancer Center in the country. The consortium is comprised of 1,100 members from five principal Harvard-affiliated hospitals and two Harvard health science schools: Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (BIDMC), Boston Children's Hospital (BCH, Brigham and Women's Hospital (BWH), Dana-Farber Cancer Institute (DFCI), Harvard Medical School (HMS), Harvard T. H. Chan School of Public Health (HSPH), and Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH). The progress presented in this proposal has required DF/HCC leadership, its combined resources, and, most importantly, its consortium structure. The overarching scientific vision is to unite the members. The research of the Center is carried out in Research Programs that cross both scientific and institutional boundaries. In addition, the Center supports Shared Resources dedicated to enhancing scientific efficiency available to all Center members. The unified clinical research infrastructure has made it easier for members to conduct clinical trials across the Center. Indirect indications of scientific progress are the substantial growth in the Center's grant portfolio, from $233 million in 1999 to $406 million in 2004, to $623 million in 2009, to $683M and the award of multiple translational grants that transcend organizational boundaries (e.g., SPOREs, SCORs, P01s, U01s, and SU2Cs). There is also an array of hypothesis-driven, Early Phase (pilot, I, I-II), and proof-of-concept trials, made possible through the development and execution of the Center, that are conducted daily across the consortium."
"9437925","Project Summary There is only limited information about the newly described type 2 innate lymphoid cell (ILC2) population in the lung, the regulation of these cells, and their impact on protection against acute respiratory infections. We have now found that IFN-? negatively regulates ILC2 immune function and that animals deficient in IFN-? expression demonstrate increased resistance to both primary H1N1 pandemic virus infection as well as secondary pneumococcal infection. Enhanced ILC2 activity in viral-infected IFN-?-/- mice is accompanied by decreased lung tissue inflammation and increased expression of pulmonary IL-5, amphiregulin, and eosinophils, but no change in viral burden. Importantly, the increased protection seen after IFN-? neutralization is not observed in ILC2-deficient mice. Studies in this proposal are designed to now determine the unique role of ILC2s in resistance to influenza and secondary bacterial infections. Based on our preliminary data, we hypothesize that IFN-? signaling diminishes ILC2 innate effector function and leads to decreased tissue homeostasis and host survival. To test this concept, we will exploit several unique resources, including novel strains of mice that are deficient in ILC2s, eosinophil expression, and TGF-?IIR signaling, as well as our extensive experience in studying host-pathogen interactions. The aims are to determine for the first time: 1) the role of ILC2s in mediating resistance to CA04 influenza infection; and 2) the role of ILC2s in regulating susceptibility to secondary bacterial infections following influenza. The ultimate goal is to obtain an understanding of the processes responsible for protection against acute respiratory infection and to exploit the information obtained in order to influence clinical approaches for prevention and treatment of influenza and associated secondary bacterial infections."
"9444163","The overall goals of this project are to develop and validate robust, <20-minute MRI strategies for pre-procedural high-resolution imaging of the great vessels, free from the need for contrast agents or electrocardiographic (ECG) gating.  The use of pre-procedural CT angiography (CTA) and contrast-enhanced MRA (CEMRA) provides critical structural information that is essential for optimal patient outcomes. However, most patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) or pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) are elderly, and many suffer from multi-system vascular disorders or other co-morbidities. The high incidence of renal dysfunction in these patients raises serious concerns for giving contrast agents. With severe renal dysfunction, CTA is contraindicated due to the risk of contrast-induced nephropathy, while CEMRA is contraindicated due to the risks of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis and tissue-deposition of gadolinium more generally. We hypothesize that next- generation optimized imaging strategies (OIS) based on single-shot radial quiescent-interval slice-selective (QISS) MRA will provide a high-impact benefit to patient care by enabling the creation of artifact-free angiographic images with near isotropic spatial resolution, without the need for contrast agents. Moreover, each OIS will be highly efficient with a total exam time <20 minutes. Both breath-hold and free-breathing strategies will be explored. Technical enhancements will include: (1) undersampled single-shot radial acquisitions to reduce sensitivity to cardiac arrhythmias, (2) iterative reconstruction using non-Cartesian SENSE or compressed sensing to improve the image quality of highly-undersampled radial scans, (3) navigator-gated 2D acquisitions to eliminate the need for breath-holding, (4) retrospective motion correction using affine or nonrigid transformations so as to facilitate the creation of maximum intensity projections and volume renderings, (5) strategic application of disk-shaped pseudocontinuous arterial spin labeling (PCASL) regions to enable the creation of vessel-selective angiograms; (6) M-mode gating to improve the robustness of cardiac synchronization while eliminating the need for electrocardiographic (ECG) leads. (7) simultaneous multi-slice methods to facilitate efficient coverage of large vascular regions and minimize the likelihood of image misregistration for breath-hold exams; (8) frequency-swept acquisitions to mitigate banding artifacts.  This proposal entails an initial 3-year technical development phase followed by a 2-year research trial to validate the optimized imaging strategies. The specific aims for our five-year proposal are as follows:  1. To develop <20-minute optimized imaging strategies for near isotropic imaging of the great vessels,  free from the need for contrast agents or ECG gating.  2. To perform a single-center research trial in patients scheduled for TAVR or PVI, in order to validate the  performance of breath-hold and free-breathing OIS in comparison with pre-procedural CTA."

"9397566","Summary Cardiac performance significantly impacts quality of life; cardiac dysfunction and arrhythmia increase with age and can lead to heart disease, the number one cause of death in the United States. Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common type of cardiac arrhythmia and AF significantly increases the risk of heart failure and stroke. A genetic basis for AF is indicated in one third of patients and pro-fibrotic and apoptotic effects of sustained AF in patients and animal models have been documented. A major barrier to understanding the interplay between electrical and structural cardiac remodeling is the overwhelming complexity of mammalian systems. In order to define fundamental molecular/genetic links, I propose to use a simpler, genetically tractable model, Drosophila. The fruit fly has proven extremely useful in elucidating the first conserved genetic networks responsible for heart development and in identifying cellular mechanisms underlying adult heart function and disease. I have identified important similarities in ion channel function and cardiac arrhythmias between flies and humans including early afterdepolarizations that lead to tachyarrhythmias. Genetic analyses of hearts from flies with mutations in these channels reveal interesting differences in wnt and hippo signaling pathways and suggest possible connections between them. Individually, these pathways have been implicated in human heart cardiomyopathies and there are tantalizing suggestions that these pathways may be involved in maintenance and regeneration of adult cardiac function. I will use the fly cardiac model I have developed to elucidate underlying genetic/molecular connections between these pathways in both ?healthy? and ?diseased? hearts with subsequent validation in the vertebrate zebrafish heart model. The interplay between electrical activity, Ca2+ handling, and cardiac function/structure is likely a balancing act for post-mitotic organs with limited regenerative capacity; understanding this will be important in developing effective therapies to treat human cardiomyopathies."
"9395936","Little is known about the epigenetic bases of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk. Our recent large cross-sectional study revealed many monocyte transcriptome and epigenome signatures associated with subclinical atherosclerosis. Some of these genomic features appeared to partially mediate the relationship between traditional CVD risk factors (e.g. age, obesity, and smoking) and measures of atherosclerosis. The transcriptome signatures included an H3K9me2 demethylase transcription coactivator, ARID5B, which is known to promote adipogenesis and smooth muscle development. Methylation of ARID5B enhancer was inversely associated with both ARID5B expression and atherosclerosis. Our experimental in vitro study further showed that ARID5B promotes expression of genes involved in atherosclerosis-related pro-inflammatory and lipid metabolism pathways after lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation. These results support a pivotal epigenetic checkpoint for controlling immunometabolic homeostasis and promoting chronic inflammatory reactions, which may contribute to atherosclerosis. These data set a compelling stage for prospective studies of the candidate genomic features and mechanistic dissection of the role of ARID5B in atherogenesis. The goals of our proposed study are to identify atherosclerosis associated ?promising? genomic features that are predictive of atherogenesis and its progression, to characterize their associations with plaque vulnerability, to determine their genetic and non-genetic predictors, and to elucidate their mechanistic linkage to atherogenesis. We will study 1,892 randomly selected subjects from four Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) field centers that have planned genomic, DNA methylomic, and transcriptomic data from purified CD14+ monocytes, as well as concurrent assessment of CVD risk factors and ultrasonographic carotid plaque burden from MESA Exam 5. We will repeat ultrasound imaging to quantify and characterize carotid plaques, and re-evaluate DNA methylomic and transcriptomic profiles of monocytes at MESA Exam 6, and we will perform in vivo and in vitro functional studies to achieve the following specific aims: Aim 1. To validate predictive effects of atherosclerosis-associated genomic features identified at Exam 5 on initiation and progression of atherosclerosis in a prospective study with 6-years of follow-up. Aim 2. To characterize the associations of the ?promising? genomic features with carotid plaque vulnerability. Aim 3. To identify potential temporal and causal relationships between known genetic and non-genetic CVD risk factors, the ?promising? genomic features, and plaque burden. Aim 4. To determine the functional consequences of alterations of most the ?promising? genomic features. If successful, the identified ?promising? genomic features will provide mechanistic insights into the etiology of atherosclerosis and potential targets for therapeutic intervention."
"9418083","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Voltage-gated Na+ channelopathies are associated with multiple disorders. Mutations in neuronal Na+ channels cause epilepsy syndromes, ataxia, and autism; mutations in the cardiac Na+ channels are associated with arrhythmias, sudden infant death syndrome, conduction disorders, and cardiomyopathies. A hotspot for disease-causing mutations is the channels' C-terminal domain (CTD), which harbors a calmodulin (CaM) interaction site. Because Ca2+ is the ultimate signal of electrical activity and is often perturbed in disease states, the presence of a key Ca2+ sensor (CaM) at a hotspot for channel regulation (the CTD) provides a starting point for understanding how these channelopathies cause disease. Nevertheless, regulation of Na+ channels by Ca2+/CaM is poorly understood and information is limited by the lack of structural information and challenges to investigating channel function in native cell types. Here, we build on new structural information and novel methods to investigate how Ca2+/CaM regulates Na+ channels in the context of native cell types. Our new structural information provides background and guideposts for investigating how Ca2+-free (apo) CaM and Ca2+-loaded CaM differently affect channel function; how neuronal and cardiac channels are distinctly regulated by CaM in their native cell types, and how different CaM interacting domains within Na+ channels contribute to overall Ca2+/CaM-dependent regulation. Our novel methods of studying informative mutants in cardiomyocytes and neurons will provide an understanding of how Ca2+ affects Na+ channels and thus how Ca2+ dysregulation leads to the various Na+ channelopathies. The specific Aims addressed in this proposal are to determine: 1) How Ca2+-free apoCaM controls NaV function in neurons and cardiomyocytes; 2) How Ca2+/CaM interaction with the NaV CTD controls NaV function in neurons and cardiomyocytes; and 3) How Ca2+/CaM interaction with the NaV III-IV intracellular linker controls NaV function in neurons and cardiomyocytes."
"9612847","Objective: To improve mining safety and health training in the western United States to support efforts to reduce mining injuries, illnesses and fatalities. Background: Despite continued improvements over time, mining injuries and fatalities continue to occur in the mining industry, and reducing occupational illnesses remains challenging. Building on our past NIOSH miner training (U60) grants, we will use a competency- based framework to integrate health and safety training for miners, trainers, and managers. Specific Aims: 1) Offer active learning-based safety and health training to mine workers; 2) Offer innovative train-the-trainer programs; and 3) Establish collaborative partnerships for critical control management. Study Design: we will use a competency-based framework with five levels. Level 1 will provide knowledge needed for new miners as part of new miner training and short pre-shift training. Level 2 will provide knowledge for more experienced miners during annual refresher training. Level 3 is ?blue card? training for new safety trainers. Level 4 is for experienced trainers who need to know how to improve their training and design training materials. Level 5 is for safety managers and executives to improve their knowledge of process safety, assessing material unwanted events and critical controls. For mine workers, we will accommodate English language learners, low literacy and education disadvantaged learners. We will use a suite of serious games, Learn with Harry, to encourage critical thinking about safety, with emphasis on worker health, hazards recognition, and MSHA's rules to live by. The serious games software has robust evaluation tools and can test improvement over time. For trainers we will develop and offer Instructional Design for the Safety and Technical Trainer Certificate Program using the competency model we are publishing through the Department of Labor. For managers and executives we will create a workshop to learn about critical controls and develop networking mechanism through our website and social media that allows lessons learned to be shared across companies and industry sectors including contractors, vendors, manufacturers, and operating companies. We will partner with rock products associations in the key states of California, Arizona, Texas, Nevada, and Colorado to offer our training programs to their member companies. All NIOSH NORA cross-sector topic areas will be addressed through addition of health modules in new miner, refresher training and train the trainer modules, and through inclusion of these topics within the critical control management activities. By integrating our training under a single competency framework, we will provide a coherent structure for evaluation and for impact. Relevance to public health: Anticipated outcomes include improved safety and health practices, a published competency model for mine safety trainers, workers empowered through active learning to be active participants in improving workplace safety and health, and increased sharing of lessons learned across industry segments. Collectively the outcomes should result in fewer mining injuries, illnesses and fatalities."
"9434338","Project Summary / Abstract Typhoid fever is a major global health concern, with ongoing occurring outbreaks in some developing countries. The causative agent of typhoid fever is the gram-negative bacterium, Salmonella Typhi. It was recently discovered that S. Typhi produces an unusual toxin known as typhoid toxin. The goal of this research program is to generate the first B cell epitope map of typhoid toxin, with a particular focus on identification of regions associated with the onset of toxin-neutralizing antibodies. In Specific Aim 1 we will generate a collection of murine monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) against all of the three components of typhoid toxin, CdtB, PltA and PltB and characterize them to identify potent MAbs by performing ELISA, cell-based toxin-neutralization assays, competition ELISA, pepscan analysis, mutagenesis, and surface plasmon resonance. In Specific Aim 2 a select number of toxin-neutralizing MAbs generated in Aim 1 will be evaluated for the ability to passively protect mice against lethal dose typhoid toxin challenge. We will test whether the MAbs with the most potent toxin-neutralizing activity in vitro are also protective in vivo. Additionally, we will begin to define the mechanism(s) by which the most potent MAbs neutralize typhoid toxin in vitro. The MAbs generated as part of this study will be powerful tools for more detailed mechanistic studies to better understand the biology of typhoid toxin and may even have potential applications for therapeutics uses in humans."
"9472753","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT: Treatment for chronic HCV infection is now highly effective. Direct Acting Antivirals (DAA) are generally safe and most persistent infections are cured with 2-3 months of therapy. However, a strategy to control chronic hepatitis C by antiviral therapy alone is complicated by two factors. First, although antiviral therapies have improved steadily over the past 25 years, the percentage of individuals cured of chronic hepatitis C is still remarkably low in the US and globally. Almost all untreated individuals (3 million in the US, 180 million globally) are unaware of their persistent infection; there are often no symptoms of HCV infection until progressive liver disease becomes apparent many years after exposure to the virus. Second, HCV transmission has accelerated in most regions of the world. In the US, infection rates increased over the past decade because of ongoing epidemic injection drug use amongst adolescents and young adults. New undiagnosed HCV infections will almost certainly develop at a rate that outpaces detection and antiviral cure. A vaccine could help stem HCV transmission, however a complete understanding of correlates of protection is lacking. While an early appearance of broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) generally correlates with a more favorable infection outcome, the inability to isolate HCV- specific B cells to dissect their phenotype, function, receptor repertoire, gene expression and neutralization breadth has hindered the understanding of the molecular mechanisms that determine infection outcome. We have developed a novel tetramer that detects HCV E2 glycoprotein-specific memory B cells in patients infected with HCV. The objective of this grant is to define the longitudinal changes in HCV-specific B cell clonal selection and the breadth of bNAbs resulting from the interplay between HCV-specific CD4+ T follicular helper cells (Tfh) and HCV-specific B cells. Our central hypothesis is that a rapid induction of the HCV-specific Tfh cell response accelerates the selection and expansion of HCV-specific B cell clones producing bNAbs that contribute to resolution of infection. Our specific aims will test whether: HCV-specific B cells isolated longitudinally at single cell level from spontaneous resolvers are more activated, clonally focused and produce antibodies with greater neutralization breadth than HCV-specific B cells from persistently-infected patients (Aim 1); an early increase in Tfh cell activity during acute infection in spontaneous resolvers directly influences the rapid, clonal expansion of HCV-specific B cells and subsequent bNAb production (Aim 2). This study makes a significant contribution towards a vaccine-based approach designed to prevent primary HCV infection and/or reinfection."
"9424143","Soluble guanylyl cyclase (sGC) is a highly sensitive nitric oxide (NO) receptor, which plays a key role in neurotransmission, platelet and vascular function. Because diminished sGC function promotes coronary artery disease, atherosclerosis, hypertension, heart attacks and vascular disorders, maintaining proper function of sGC is an important public health issue. Understanding the mechanisms of sGC function and regulation is essential for improving existing and developing new sGC-based therapies. While NO-dependent activation of sGC has been extensively investigated, the process of sGC deactivation is poorly understood. Fast deactivation is essential to properly time sGC cell signaling, but may be disadvantageous for sustaining activated sGC for therapeutic purposes. Although published reports indicate that some proteins involved in protein maturation and folding affect the activity of intracellular sGC 9-12, these effects are most likely not specific to sGC. We have recently identified G-protein signaling modulator proteins GPSM1 and GPSM2 as a new type of sGC modulators, which associate with sGC and attenuate its activation. Our preliminary studies show a predominant expression of GPSM1 in mouse aorta and demonstrate that mice lacking GPSM1 have increased sGC activity in aorta and a longer response to sGC activators.  Our long-term goal is to determine how regulation of sGC can be manipulated for therapeutic purposes. Based on preliminary studies, our central hypothesis is that GPSM1 protein is a critical factor that modulates sGC function in normal and disease vascular smooth muscles (VSMC) and mediates the crosstalk between NO/cGMP and G?i-dependent signaling. The main objectives of the study are to identify the molecular mechanism by which GPSM1 modulate sGC, to characterize the effects of this modulation in animal models, and to determine how sGC-GPSM1 communication affects G?i-dependent signaling in VSMC. We will test this hypothesis by: a) determining the changes in sGC-dependent vascular function in GPSM1-/- mice; b) establishing the fundamental step(s) in negative modulation of sGC by GPSM1, and c) elucidating the effect of GPSM1 on communication between sGC- and G?i-dependent signaling pathways in VSMC.  This study is significant because it addresses the regulation of sGC, and enzyme whose function play an important role in health and disease processes. The proposal is innovative because it establishes the basis for the rational design of new pharmacological therapies that directly target the contact between sGC and GPSM1 and augment the efficacy of existing sGC-based therapies."
"9447709","ABSTRACT  Ubiquitin (Ub), a small protein that is conserved in all eukaryotes, is attached to cellular proteins as a post- translational modification (PTM) that signals a large variety of downstream events, proteasome-dependent degradation being the most familiar. Histones are among the most abundant ubiquitinated substrates, and their ubiquitination typically does not lead to degradation. Instead, the functional consequences are diverse and de- pend on the type of histone ubiquitinated as well as the specific lysine to which Ub is attached. Like other epi- genetic signals, ubiquitination of histones is reversible; histone deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) feature prom- inently in the regulation of transcriptional activation, silencing, and DNA damage response.  We have previously shown that a highly conserved DUB, UCH37, is associated with two large multi-subunit complexes, the 26S proteasome and the INO80 chromatin remodeler, and that these complexes have oppos- ing effects on UCH37 deubiquitination activity. This proposal focuses on how the human INO80 complex re- stricts the specificity of UCH37 and how deubiquitination of histone proteins by INO80-UCH37 may promote transcription and DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair. We will use our knowledge of hINO80 biochemistry and UCH37 structure and enzymology to address the following questions: (i) What is the substrate specificity of INO80-UCH37 (Aim 1)? (ii) What is the mechanism of hINO80-UCH37 activation and remodeling-coupled deubiquitination (Aim 2)? (iii) What is the function of hINO80-UCH37 and H2A.Z ubiquitination in transcription and DNA DSB repair (Aim 3)? By employing a combination of in vitro biochemistry, single-molecule studies, and in vivo genomics approaches, we will investigate the interplay between histone variant H2A.Z, deubiquiti- nation by UCH37, and chromatin remodeling by INO80. Together, these factors contribute to a chromatin envi- ronment that regulates the transcription and DNA repair machinery."
"9455365","Nociception is the process whereby a subset of somatosensory nerve fibers (called nociceptors) detect noxious stimuli and transmit this information to the spinal cord and brain, ultimately producing a percept of discomfort or pain. Nociceptors are faced with the complex task of detecting disparate environmental and endogenous signals of both a physical and chemical nature; these include temperature, pressure, irritants, pruritogens, and inflammatory agents. Consequently, nociceptor activation elicits acute pain as well as injury-evoked pain hypersensitivity and can contribute to so-called ?maladaptive? processes underlying persistent pain syndromes. Our goal is to understand how nociceptors detect and integrate these signals in response to changing environmental or physiological conditions. Natural products from plants or venomous creatures have served as tremendously valuable tools for deciphering cellular and molecular mechanisms contributing to nociception and pain. Notable examples include the use of natural analgesics, such as morphine (from the opium poppy) and salicylate (from willow bark) to discover opioid receptors and cyclooxgenases, respectively. Other important examples include the use of natural irritants, such as capsaicin (from chili peppers) and menthol (from mint leaves) to identify ion channels that detect heat and cold, respectively. Indeed, each of these natural product receptors represents a validated or potential target for pharmacological management of acute or chronic pain. This proposal is aimed at elucidating molecules, cells, and mechanisms that contribute to nociception in the context of acute (protective) or pathological (chronic) pain states. We shall continue to exploit the vast chemical ?space? of natural product pharmacology to identify and characterize ion channels and sensory neuron subtypes that contribute to distinct nociceptive modalities. At the most reductionist level, we will use biophysical, biochemical, and pharmacological tools to elucidate structural mechanisms underlying ion channel function, including stimulus detection, drug binding, and gating. Here, the main emphasis will be on members of the TRP channel family that are targeted by natural pungent agents and play major roles in thermo- or chemo-nociception. At a more integrative level, we will use molecular and pharmacological probes to characterize distinct nociceptor subtypes, whose functionalities will be examined in mice using genetic, anatomical, and in vivo imaging methods. As one such example, we are interested in characterizing a population of presumptive A? nociceptors and asking how they contribute to mechanical pain. Together, these studies will provide important mechanistic insights for the development of novel analgesic therapies."
"9471901","Abstract Elucidating the functions of bacterial secretion systems is important for a complete understanding of host pathogen interaction processes. Secretion systems are complex machines that inject effectors proteins into the host, and in some cases allow establishment of a replicative niche by promoting biogenesis of a cellular compartment that supports bacterial replication. In this project we will determine how the Legionella pneumophila Type IVB secretion system called Dot/Icm functions at the molecular level. This will be accomplished by studying the spatiotemporal dynamics of fluorescently tagged secretion system components using time-lapse video microscopy. Strains of Legionella that have been genetically modified to eliminate individual Dot and Icm proteins, and strains engineered to produce minicells, will be used to determine the structure of the Dot/Icm system by cryo-electron tomography. The overall goal of the project is to use imaging and molecular approaches to characterize what are the spatiotemporal dynamics processes that control Dot/Icm secretion system activity, and to visualize the Dot/icm system so that we have an understanding of the different subassemblies that comprise a functional Type IVB apparatus."
"9432028","PROJECT SUMMARY Despite large improvements in global childhood mortality in the last 20 years, an astonishing 5.9 million children died before their fifth birthday in 2015. Three of the top five causes of death are infectious, including pneumonia, diarrhea, and neonatal sepsis. Although extrinsic factors such as vaccination, access to clean water, antibiotics, and accurate diagnostics are targets of current public health campaigns, little is known about the host intrinsic factors that affect susceptibility to these illnesses. In particular, thus far overlooked is the role of a small number of maternal cells and DNA acquired by the fetus during pregnancy, known as maternal microchimerism, in infant infection. This proposal specifically seeks to understand the role of these maternal cells in shaping fetal and infant immune responses and subsequent protection from infectious diseases during childhood. We recently found that children with maternal microchimerism at delivery were more likely to become infected with malaria but, when infected, were less likely to become sick or to be hospitalized as compared to children without maternal microchimerism. This finding may imply a mechanism of natural ?vaccination? whereby children experience infection but are protected from disease. We hypothesize that this effect is the result of maternal regulation of pro-inflammatory fetal and infant immune responses, limiting immune-mediated pathology, and that such regulation may extend to immune responses directed against other infections of global health importance. Using samples and data from a birth cohort from Mali, we propose to identify the factors that determine the acquisition of maternal microchimerism, the ability of maternal cells to modulate the immune phenotype of the fetus and infant, and the role of maternal cells in protection from common childhood infections, including pneumonia and diarrhea. We anticipate that this study will demonstrate that acquired maternal cells influence fetal and infant immune responses, which would have broad implications for perinatal and postnatal infections and response to immunization. In addition, demonstrating that maternal cells provide protection against childhood infections would suggest an evolutionary benefit to maintaining this graft, emphasizing the importance of intergenerational immune interactions. Finally, identification of the factors that predict maternal microchimerism may lead to future targets for intentional modulation of maternal cells as a novel approach to prevent the immune-mediated morbidity and mortality associated with childhood infections of global health importance."
"9435898","SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is an autoimmune disease characterized by the destruction of the insulin producing ? cells. The diabetogenic response is complex influenced by genetic and environmental factors, which promote the breakdown of peripheral immunoregulation. Ill-defined properties intrinsic to ? cells are also believed to play a key role in T1D. ? cell reactivity to autoimmune and environmental insults, growth factors and nutrients for instance, influence loss of ? cell mass and/or function. Defining the pathways and mechanisms regulating these ? cell responses is important for the development of effective T1D immunotherapies and ? cell replacement approaches such as islet transplantation.  This R21 application is based on our novel observation that NOD mice deficient in the AIM2 inflammasome molecule remain diabetes-free. AIM2 is a cytoplasmic immune sensor that is typically associated with host defense. Upon binding double stranded DNA from a microbial pathogen, AIM2 drives assembly of an inflammasome complex leading to production of proinflammatory IL-1? and IL-18 as well as pyroptosis- mediated cell death. Recent studies, however, have demonstrated that AIM2 can serve a regulatory function outside of host defense via a nonconical pathway that is independent of inflammasome activation.  We find that the lack of diabetes in AIM2-deficient NOD mice is also independent of inflammasome activation. Furthermore, evidence suggests that AIM2 deficiency reduces ? cell sensitivity to autoimmune- mediated destruction while enhancing ? cell replication and function. We hypothesize that AIM2 functions as a ?thermostat? regulating the strength of responses to stress- and growth-inducing factors that impact ? cell survival, expansion and/or function. The overall goal of this proposal is 2-fold: 1) establish that AIM2 function is intrinsic to ? cells and affects T1D progression, and 2) begin to define the role of AIM2 in regulating ? cell reactivity to immunological insults and homeostasis. With this in mind, Specific Aim 1 will determine if AIM2 directly regulates ? cell sensitivity to cytokine and cell-contact-driven destruction, and in turn the development of overt diabetes in NOD mice. Experiments will include testing if an AIM2 variant expressed by NOD mice enhances ? cell destruction. Specific Aim 2 will define a role for AIM2 in ? cell homeostasis. Here we will determine if AIM2 regulates signaling events that stimulate ? cell replication. Together this work will establish a novel regulatory pathway in which AIM2 controls ? cell sensitivity to various immune stressors and factors that impact ? cell loss and function, and T1D progression. These findings will set the stage for future efforts to further define mechanisms by which AIM2 regulates ? cell reactivity, as well as exploit AIM2 for the purpose of T1D immunotherapy and ? cell replacement."

"9422432","Cancers are the leading cause of death for men and women in the USA between the ages of 40 and 79, with lung cancer causing the most mortality. However, forty-five years after the National Cancer Act of 1971 (war on cancer) was signed, progress in treating and curing cancer has been less than satisfying. Most anti-cancer therapies have debilitating toxic effects on normal tissues that eventually limit treatment. Even for the most cancer-selective therapeutics, cancers readily become drug resistant. The underlying molecular determinants that allow, drive and support cancer are quite variable, poorly understood and only recently have been used to design anti-cancer drugs. Thus, there is a significant need for improved therapeutics for cancer, including lung cancer, that exploit vulnerabilities linked to the underlying molecular basis of that particular disease. Normal cells, lacking the vulnerability, should be resistant to the cancer therapy. As an approach to identify vulnerabilities in cancer not be shared by healthy cells, we conducted a genome-wide siRNA screen of a non- small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell line and identified genes that were essential in this cell line, but not essential in normal cells (Tagal et al., 2017). The cell line screened, NCI-H1819, lacked expression of SMARCA4, a defect that is relatively common in several types of cancer. SMARCA4 encodes the protein Brg1, a catalytic subunit of the chromatin remodeling SWI/SNF complex, an important regulator of transcription. Through analysis of genes essential to NCI-H1819, but not normal cells, we identified a vulnerability to inhibitors of Aurora kinase A, an important mitotic kinase. The basis of the defect was an impaired centrosome- dependent mitotic spindle machinery. NSCLC cell lines that lacked Brg1 upregulate DLGAP5, which encodes the protein HURP, an essential component of a centrosome-independent machinery for mitotic spindle formation. siRNA targeting DLGAP5 was lethal for such cells, although expression of HURP is non-essential for normal somatic cells, for which the centrosome-dependent pathway of spindle formation is present. Thus, the complex containing HURP would be an ideal target for a therapeutic agent to treat cancers that have the dual biomarkers, lack of expression of Brg1 and upregulation of HURP. This application is to conduct a high- throughput screen of 300,000 drug-like chemicals to identify those that inhibit the centrosome-independent mitotic machinery, kill Brg1 null, HURP positive cancers and are non-toxic for normal somatic cells. In addition to providing potential leads for therapeutic approaches to cancer, specific chemical probes for cellular mechanisms required for cancer cell growth also provide important research tools for understanding basic cell biology or pathobiology. In the case of this application, the chemical probes generated will be important tools for understanding the molecular machinery that regulates formation of the mitotic spindle apparatus.!"

"9391977","ABSTRACT-Rapid Case Ascertainment (RCA) Shared Resource  Rapid Case Ascertainment (RCA) is a unique population science shared resource that provides central support  for population-based research by providing rapid ascertainment of cancer cases that occur across North  Carolina. Rapid case ascertainment (identification within one month after diagnosis) is critical to the successful  conduct of quality, population-based, epidemiologic and outcomes studies, including studies that incorporate  molecular biology, biomarkers, and patient-reported outcomes. Since it started in 1993, RCA supported  multiple large population science research studies of breast, colon, prostate, head and neck cancers and  melanoma. These included case-control etiologic studies and outcomes-related studies of bladder and prostate  cancer. Built on decades of close collaboration with the State of North Carolina?s Central Cancer Registry  (CCR) RCA facilitates efficient and centralized case identification. Because of its long-standing collaborative  relationship with hospitals in North Carolina, RCA also works with LCCC members to collect baseline and  follow-up medical records for enrolled patients. Finally, RCA provides consultation and administrative  assistance to researchers through the coordination of grant applications, IRB approvals, reports to hospitals  and tumor registrars, database development, and activities among project investigators, the State of North  Carolina?s CCR, and related state committees. The RCA shared resource provides centralized coordination  ascertainment, especially for hospitals in rural and underserved counties in the Center?s catchment area (all of  North Carolina). Case-finding takes place for multiple studies across hospitals, providing a high degree of  efficiency and cost effectiveness for the studies. In 2014, the facility was used to identify 16,366 new cases of  breast, meningioma, prostate, cervical, colorectal, ovarian and medullary thyroid cancer cases across all 100  counties in North Carolina. A unique and valuable resource, RCA collaborated with other NCI Cancer Centers  by supporting NC population research with other cancer centers in NC and outside the state. UNC Lineberger  investigators continue to expand their efforts in population-based studies that rely on rapid case ascertainment.  The RCA shared resource requests $73,090 in CCSG funds, representing 21% of its total budget. Future plans  include the implementation of new NC population-based epidemiologic, clinical, and health services studies  and working with the CCR to obtain additional follow-up on the occurrence of second primary tumors and the  timely assessment of vital status of cases enrolled in epidemiologic and other population studies."
"9447678","During cortical development, neural progenitor cells (NPCs) produce mature neuronal subtypes in a defined temporal order. Restriction of NPC multipotency determines the cortical neuron composition of the six-layer cortex and is governed by changes to NPC chromatin. Abnormal production of cortical progeny underlies the pathology of neurodevelopmental disorders with features of autism. Chromatin remodeling genes are often identified in autism spectrum disorder (ASD), therefore, neuronal epigenetic mechanisms are likely to be essential for corticogenesis. Developmental remodeling of histone modifications across the chromatin landscape permits spatial and temporal regulation of transcription circuitry that restricts NPC multipotency. One chromatin modification is histone H2A lysine 119 mono-ubiquitination (H2AUb1), an evolutionarily conserved repressive histone modification of the Polycomb group (PcG) proteins. We recently identified human de novo dominant pathogenic variants in the PcG protein ASXL3 (Additional sex comb-like 3) as the genetic basis of neurodevelopmental disorders with syndromic features of autism and intellectual disability. ASXL3 clearly plays a central role in mammalian brain function. We propose experiments to delineate mechanisms of ASXL3 regulation in corticogenesis. We have shown that ASXL3 is a component of the Polycomb repressive deubiquitinase complex (PR-DUB), which deubiqutinates H2AUb1. Pathogenic human ASXL3 variants alter the genome-wide H2AUb1 levels and affect transcriptional regulation in patient-derived cells. We have confirmed and extended this finding in mouse and human neural progenitor cells (NPCs). Although H2AUb1 was described more than three decades ago, its functions in transcriptional regulation and epigenetic repression are less well understood than other histone modifications. We hypothesize that ASXL3-dependent deubiquitination activity plays a critical role in specifying NPC transcriptional programs that contribute to the neuronal diversity of the cortex, and, ultimately, higher brain function. We will define the cortical developmental mechanisms regulated by ASXL3 and H2AUb1 by: (Aim 1) using an existing Asxl3 mutant mice, (Aim 2) determining the genome-wide distribution of excess H2AUb1 in NPCs and the epigenomic mechanisms of corticogenesis using genetically- engineered mice, and (Aim 3) testing the conservation of ASXL3 pathology and PR-DUB activity in human cerebral organoid models of neural development. Our experimental strategy will establish the epigenetic foundation of cortical development, identify paradigms for cortical neurogenesis in NPCs, and, ultimately, unveil the mechanisms of dysregulation that leads to ASD pathology."
"9439325","Project Summary/Abstract The long-term goal of this work is to develop immunotherapeutic agents that can prevent T cells becoming dysfunctional within the tumor microenvironment (TME), primarily for use as co-therapies with vaccine and adoptive cellular therapies. The specific goal of this project is to use a systems biology approach to identify and rank novel candidate regulators of T cell dysfunction for immunotherapeutic targeting. Functional tumor- specific CD8 T become dysfunctional on trafficking from the blood to the TME. Checkpoint inhibitors that act on T cells that already have a dysfunctional phenotype have shown remarkable efficacy in a subset of tumors. We reason that the pathways by which functional T cells progress to dysfunction within the TME should present new targets for immunotherapeutic interventions. Yet these pathways are poorly understood, in part because they are only transiently expressed on the road to failure. Snapshot analyses of TILs show us dysfunctional T cells and bystander trafficking T cells, but don't capture T cells in the act of failing. In this project we utilize a novel reagent that is a chimera between a tumor-specific antibody and a peptide- MHC, that takes bystander T cells of a known specificity in the TME and essentially turns them into tumor- specific cells. We administer the reagent iv and simultaneously initiate TCR signaling in a large number of CD8 T cells. In the first specific aim, we analyze the cells by flow cytometry for phenotype, function and numbers, comparing TCR-activated cells in the TME with non-targeted bystander cells. We will identify the specific consequences of TCR activation in the TME, describe the eventual phenotypes (e.g. death, exhaustion), and importantly, identify the time frame over which the progression occurs. In the second specific aim, we will use RNA-seq, first to identify changes in transcriptome induced by trafficking into the TME in the absence of TCR ligation. We will then monitor transcriptional changes in response to TCR ligation, from very early timepoints to the time identified in SA1 at which final stable phenotypes or death occur. We will identify induced pathways and networks, and rank putative regulators for validation and investigation as potential therapeutic targets. We predict that transcriptional changes will occur in waves, and that early, transiently expressed regulators will provide novel targets for immunotherapy. Finally, in a third specific aim, we will investigate the expression of our candidate regulators in a series of models to test the generality of our findingsi, and interrogate databases of human TIL transcriptomes. This will serve to refine our ranking of putative targets for immunotherapy."
"9394813","PROJECT SUMMARY Episodic memory, or the ability to remember  past events with specific detail, is central to the human experience and is related to learning and adaptive functioning in a variety of domains. In typically developing children, episodic memory improves emerges during infancy and improves during early childhood and beyond. Despite remarkable early episodic memory skills, most early recollections are lost to infantile amnesia, individuals' inability to recall events occurred in the first 2 or 3 years of life. Neuroscientific research has shown that the hippocampus plays a fundamental role in episodic memory, supporting the formation and retrieval of representations that bind the different aspects of an event. Of importance, developmental processes within the hippocampus are hypothesized to be primarily responsible for both the early emergence of episodic memory in children and the loss of early recollections due to infantile amnesia. However, these hypotheses are based on non-human models and no direct in-vivo evidence of early hippocampal contribution to early memory functioning and loss is available to date. This limitation is mostly due to the methodological challenge of acquiring neuroimaging data, particularly task-related functional neuroimaging data, from young children. The proposed research will explore new methods to test hippocampal structure and function in toddlers and begin to examine within-individual changes that underlie improvements and loss of episodic memory performance from 25 to 40 months, a period during which episodic memory improves, but infantile amnesia operates. Relevance to Public Health: Healthy episodic memory provides a foundation for the emergence and development of autobiographical memory, continuity of self from past to future, and is associated with the skills assessed in many measures of intellectual ability and achievement. Finally, the development of episodic memory is impaired following even mild forms of acquired neurological insult, mental health conditions such as anxiety and depression, and neurodevelopmental disorders underscoring that a characterization of its development is key to understanding adaptive functioning in various populations of children."
"9431873","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT This K99/R00 award will prepare Dr. Patrick Hannon for an independent research career, with the main goal of providing Dr. Hannon all the necessary technical and professional skills to transition into a career in academia and become a leader in the field of reproductive toxicology. Dr. Hannon has extensive training in elucidating the effects of environmental toxicants on the ovary in rodent models, but in this K99/R00 he will expand his research training and translate these findings into human health and fertility. These goals will be accomplished with the support of Dr. Hannon's enthusiastic and exceptional mentoring team, led by Drs. Thomas Curry and Humphrey Yao. The research proposal and career development plan created by Dr. Hannon with the guidance of his mentoring team will provide Dr. Hannon with new experimental techniques and skills needed to establish an independent research program. In the research training component, Dr. Hannon will elucidate the effects and mechanisms by which phthalates, a class of endocrine-disrupting chemicals, impair ovulation and fertility in humans and rodents. Women of reproductive age are exposed to phthalates on a daily basis because phthalates are incorporated in a myriad of common consumer, medical, building, and personal care products. However, little is known about the effects of environmentally relevant levels of phthalates on ovulation, especially in humans. This is concerning because defects in ovulation are the leading cause of infertility in women. Preliminary data for this proposal are the first to show that an environmentally relevant phthalate mixture inhibits progesterone (P4) production and alters the mRNA levels of P4 receptor (PGR), prostaglandin- endoperoxide synthase 2 (PTGS2), and amphiregulin (AREG) following human chorionic gonadotropin treatment (hCG; analogous to the midcycle luteinizing hormone surge) in human and mouse ovarian cells. P4, PGR, PTGS2, and AREG are known mediators of ovulation. Thus, these findings suggest that phthalate exposure may disrupt ovulation contributing to infertility. A primary human granulosa cell model and mice will be utilized to test the hypothesis that phthalates adversely impact ovulatory processes by altering the levels of ovulatory mediators leading to impaired ovulation and fertility. Specific Aim 1 (Mentored Phase) will determine which ovulatory events are impaired by phthalate exposure. Specific Aim 2 (Mentored and Independent Phases) will elucidate the mechanisms by which phthalates impair these ovulatory processes. Specific Aim 3 (Independent Phase) will establish that phthalate exposure causes impaired ovulation and infertility in vivo. These findings will establish the impact of phthalates on female fertility and reproductive health, while providing Dr. Hannon the necessary research and professional skills for his academic career. Further, the attainment of a greater understanding of the mechanisms of action of phthalates in human samples will begin to provide avenues to intervene on phthalate-induced reproductive dysfunction and infertility."
"9441239","ABSTRACT: Ozone (O3), a highly recognized cause of environmental lung injury, contributes to exacerbations of chronic pulmonary diseases and overall mortality. Despite efforts to reduce ambient O3 levels, these are expected to rise with global warming. Addressing this public health concern requires focus on pulmonary mechanism(s) of O3-induced host-responses to identify candidate pathways that can be targeted with precision in susceptible individuals. O3 inhalation is known to compromise barrier integrity of respiratory epithelial surfaces, an initial step in pulmonary injury. Although frequently overlooked, a compromised epithelium compounds susceptibility to subsequent exposures with airborne infectious and/or toxic agents. Epithelial barrier preservation requires coordinated signaling between the epithelium and resident immune cells, principally macrophages. Identifying the specific cellular mechanisms critical to this interaction would identify individuals with heightened susceptibility to O3 inhalation and potential targets for intervention. In controlled exposures of healthy human subjects to O3, the expression of the interferon-? (IFN-?) inducible chemokines CXCL9, CXCL10 and CXCL11 in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) macrophages are increased and this expression is associated with increased BAL albumin, a marker of epithelial permeability. Consistent with the human data, mice deficient in the receptor for the IFN-? inducible chemokines (CXCR3-/-) are protected from O3-induced increases in epithelial permeability and demonstrate altered expression of epithelial barrier proteins. To translate the CXCR3-/- finding, a common human polymorphism of CXCR3 exists wherein individuals with the minor allele have reduced CXCR3 gene expression/function. Therefore, this polymorphism may identify individuals with decreased susceptibility to O3-derived health effects. Based on these findings, we hypothesize that O3 induces the production and release of IFN-? inducible chemokines by airway macrophages, activating CXCR3 on epithelial cells, which leads to O3-induced permeability via modulation of epithelial barrier proteins. Our Specific Aims are: Aim 1: To define the requirements for and mechanisms of CXCR3 signaling in O3-induced epithelial permeability at the cellular level; Aim 2: To define the impact of CXCL10-CXCR3 signaling on O3-induced epithelial barrier dysfunction in vivo; and Aim 3: To define if a human intronic CXCR3 polymorphism that reduces CXCR3 functionality defines genetic susceptibility to O3-derived alterations in airway inflammation, and epithelial permeability. These studies will clearly determine the extent to which the CXCL10/CXCR3 axis mediates increased O3-induced airway epithelial permeability and whether a functional CXCR3 polymorphism is associated with O3 susceptibility. Furthermore, it provides a means to identify O3- susceptible individuals and define novel therapeutics to limit O3-induced epithelial permeability."
"9391009","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): SCD is a genetic blood disorder characterized by abnormal hemoglobin S (HbS) synthesis with sickle cell anemia (SCA) as the most common subtype. Stroke is the most frequent cause of death and long-term disability in both children and adults with SCD. Studies of patients with focal neurologic deficits have revealed abnormalities of both large and small vessels in SCD. Currently, the main clinical screening test is the use of transcranial Doppler (TCD) for neurologically asymptomatic children with SCD. The TCD test has a low positive predictive value and is not effective to screen stroke risk in adult SCD patients. Cerebral blood flow (CBF), a measure of the microvascular perfusion of the brain, has been recognized as a potentially more sensitive and specific indicator of early cerebrovascular impairment in both children and adults with SCD. CBF measurement based on the arterial spin labeling (ASL) MRI technique is promising as it does not require a contrast agent and is free of radiation. However, the existing ASL techniques often acquire 2D multi-slice perfusion-weighted MRI at a single post-labeling delay and, for CBF calculation, make assumptions on a number of parameters that are related to blood properties, such as arterial arrival time (AAT), longitudinal relaxation time (T1) of blood and labeling efficiency. The overall goal of the research proposed is to develop and validate a multi-delay 3D ASL protocol combined with per-subject measurements of blood T1 and labeling efficiency, which provides accurate and reliable perfusion metrics (CBF and AAT) for SCD patients. The measured CBF and AAT are expected to allow detection of both small and large vessel disease simultaneously for SCD. The specific aims of this study is first to develop a comprehensive and fast ASL-based perfusion protocol and demonstrate its reliability and reproducibility in healthy volunteers (Aim 1), then to validate the measured CBF and AAT with phase-contrast MR Angiography (PC-MRA) and dynamic susceptibility contrast (DSC) MRI in a group of SCA patients without a history of stroke (Aim 2), and finally to monitor CBF and AAT in patients with SCD and a history of stroke to explore the association between CBF and AAT and recurrent brain injury (Aim 3)."
"9399674","Abstract Atherosclerotic plaque rupture is the cause of acute coronary syndromes and symptomatic carotid artery disease in 75% of cases with high mortality. Most studies in animal models have focused on investigation of early stage lesions, not advanced lesions which in humans contribute to late stage clinical events. As such, our understanding of mechanisms and factors that control stability of late stage lesions is relatively poor. In many vascular diseases such as post-angioplasty restenosis and atherosclerosis, contractile vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) undergo phenotypic modulation to a synthetic phenotypic in which VSMC exhibit increased proliferation and migration and decreased differentiation. Whether or not VSMC phenotypes controls plaque stability hasn't been well studied and, further, the factors controlling VSMC phenotype switch remain unknown. Our published and preliminary data including in this proposal have demonstrated that AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) ?2 deficiency results in decreased expression of contractile proteins and increased synthetic proteins in the plaque and promotes the features of unstable plaques in vivo. Mechanistically, we have found that AMPK?2 deficiency upregulates the expression of Krüppel-like factor 4 (KLF4), which is a key regulator of VSMC phenotypic switch. Based on this exciting preliminary data, we hypothesize that AMPK?2 is essential in suppressing atherosclerotic plaque growth and vulnerability by inhibiting the VSMC phenotypic switching in a KLF4-dependent mechanism. This hypothesis will be tested in three aims. Aim 1 is to establish the essential role of AMPK?2 in regulating VSMC phenotypical switch, atherosclerosis, and the instability of atherosclerotic plaques in VSMC-specific ApoE-/- /AMPK?2-/- double knockout mice (Apoe?/?AMPK?2sm-/-) with or without metformin, a potent AMPK activator; After that, we will determine if phenotypic transitions observed in our mouse studies also occur in human atherosclerotic lesions (from autopsy samples). Aim 2 is to demonstrate that KLF4 is required for AMPK?2-deficiency-induced VSMC phenotypic switching. We fully anticipate the completion of the proposed studies will provide the rationales for developing AMPK?2-specific agonists as novel strategies for the prevention and efficient treatment of plaque destabilization and rupture that contribute to end stage clinical events leading to myocardial infarction and stroke."
"9427278","Project Summary/Abstract Heart failure (HF) is a major public health problem worldwide, and half of patients presenting with HF have preserved (HFpEF), rather than reduced ejection fraction. However, HFpEF remains a therapeutic challenge, given current limited understanding of causal and contributing factors, and clinical heterogeneity within HFpEF subphenotypes. Comorbidities such as obesity and hypertension are thought to induce a systemic pro- inflammatory state that, in turn, drives cardiovascular dysfunction and remodeling leading to HFpEF. Indeed, downstream markers of inflammation have been observed in HFpEF. However, accumulating evidence suggests that upstream mediators of inflammation are more likely to play a causal role in disease pathogenesis and, in turn, serve as effective therapeutic targets. Upstream initiation of inflammation in humans is governed primarily by small molecule effectors of arachidonic acid metabolism, termed eicosanoids. These bioactive lipids include thromboxanes, prostaglandins, lipoxins, and leukotrienes, and harbor pro- and anti-inflammatory activity, vasoactivity, and direct modulation of cardiomyocyte signaling and contractile function. To date, the interaction between eicosanoid pathways and development of HFpEF remain poorly understood, thus limiting our ability to harness their therapeutic potential. Advanced methods using mass spectrometry now allow for the rapid and accurate quantification of >150 upstream eicosanoid mediators representing multiple enzymatic origins. To provide a more detailed understanding of how upstream eicosanoid pathways may underlie the progression from risk factors to HFpEF, and shed light onto HFpEF subphenotypes, we will pursue two related lines of investigation: In Aim 1, we will investigate the association of circulating eicosanoids with clinical risk factors, subclinical cardiac remodeling, and incident HFpEF in the community. In Aim 2, we will examine the association of eicosanoid profiles with HFpEF subphenotypes, including distinct cardiac and extracardiac vascular dysfunction among clinical HFpEF patients. This proposal leverages a unique multidisciplinary team of collaborators with expertise in clinical epidemiology, advanced imaging, exercise physiology, bioinformatics, analytical chemistry, and lipidomics. Our systematic approach to comprehensively investigating the components of upstream inflammatory activity in two large, well-phenotyped community-based cohorts, complemented by a group of clinical HFpEF patients with comprehensive exercise hemodynamic evaluations and deep physiologic phenotyping to assess distinct aspects of cardiovascular dysfunction, promises to yield important insights into the molecular determinants of HFpEF. Importantly, these studies will lay the foundation for future investigations focused on disease prevention and optimal therapies tailored to HFpEF subphenotype."
"9391985","ABSTRACT:  Approximately 20-25% of all cancers result from infectious agents, with the majority of these malignancies  being virus-associated cancers. The Virology Program focuses on deciphering the basic mechanisms related  to how human tumor viruses are linked to the development of malignancies with the goal of generating new  specific therapies for cancer and for vaccines against these viruses. There are five programmatic themes in  the Virology Program. These include (i) Viruses and Immunity (ii) Virus-Cell Interactions (iii) Viral Pathogenesis  and Tumorigenesis (iv) AIDS-associated cancers and (v) Clinical & Translational Virology. These themes  address the effects of viral infection on innate immunity and inflammation and the mechanisms by which  viruses promote tumorigenesis with the ultimate goal being to develop new therapies for treating viral cancers  and vaccines against oncogenic viruses. Some discoveries include the finding that virus-infected cells secrete  exosomes which modulate the tumor environment, that viral-encoded microRNAs contribute to the  development of neoplasms, that oncogenic viruses can blunt innate immune recognition by the host cell, and  that new therapies for AIDS-associated cancers targeting cell signaling pathways are efficacious.  The program is jointly led by Nancy Raab-Traub, PhD, Sarah Graham Kenan Professor of Microbiology &  Immunology who is world renowned for her work on Epstein-Barr virus and associated cancers, and Blossom  Damania, PhD, Assistant Dean of Research and Professor of Microbiology & Immunology, whose expertise on  innate immunity and oncogenic viruses is well recognized.  There are 19 program members from 6 different departments across campus. The Virology Program has  recruited three new faculty since 2010: Cary Moody, Nat Moorman and Stan Lemon. During the last funding  period, program members have published 343 cancer-related articles (24% collaborative). In 2014, our  program members held 58 grants and $18.9M (total cost) in annual extramural funding, including 21 grants and  $6M (total costs) from the NCI."
"9390491","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The chronic heart failure state (CHF) is characterized by neurohumoral activation and cardiac remodeling (fibrosis, dilation and hypertrophy). Sympatho-excitation is mediated by several mechanisms that have been the focus of previous studies from this laboratory. In the CHF state a potent cardiogenic reflex known as the cardiac sympathetic afferent reflex (CSAR) is activated by an increase in the activity of sympathetic afferents on or near the surface of the ventricles. This excitatory reflex, in part, drives sympathetic efferent nerve activity to the heart and the periphery. In a recent study we demonstrated that selective removal of these afferents using the ultrapotent TRPV1 receptor agonist Resiniferitoxn (RTX), at the time of myocardial infarction (MI) in rats, resulted in a decrease in cardiac and renal sympathetic nerve activity and norepinephrine excretion 9-11 weeks following the MI. In addition, this intervention decreased the remodeling process by reducing extracellular matrix proteins (fibronectin, collagen, ? smooth muscle actin). The resultant effect of RTX treatment was a decrease in LV end diastolic pressure and an increase in diastolic function along with an increase in the cardiac response to isoproterenol (cardiac reserve). The current proposal extends these observations and seeks to further understand the mechanisms responsible for the beneficial effects of CSAR ablation post MI and in CHF. In order to determine if the beneficial effects of CSAR ablation are mediated by reducing cardiac efferent sympathetic outflow Specific Aim 1 will compare RTX treatment with both global sympathetic blockade (6 hydroxy dopamine) or specific ?1 or ?1 blockade on the remodeling process. In addition, this aim will determine if abrogation of the renin-angiotensin system compares to RTX treatment for both sympathetic outflow and remodeling in the rat MI model. Specific Aim 2 will address the issue of afferent neuropeptide depletion by RTX evoking anti-inflammatory effects which, in turn, reduces the remodeling process. Cardiac vascular permeability (Evans Blue) and blockade of Substance P receptors will be used to address this question. In order for this novel paradigm to be clinically applicable, we must determine the optimal therapeutic window where RTX treatment reverses or attenuates the autonomic and fibrotic events in the CHF state. Therefore, Specific Aim 3 will examine the responses to epicardial RTX treatment at various time points following MI in the rat model and will determine autonomic and remodeling effects of epidural peri- ganglion (T1-T4 DRGs containing the predominant CSAR afferent soma) application of RTX, which is considered as an alternative CSAR denervation strategy. The novelty of these studies is that, for the first time, a classical afferent nociceptive pathway is the target for improvement in cardiac function in the CHF or post MI states. While these afferents have been viewed as primarily transmitting cardiac pain, our data clearly show they are polymodal and should be considered as new targets for therapy."
"9464287","Arrhythmias refer to the disruption of the natural heart rhythm. This irregular heart rhythm causes the heart to suddenly stop pumping blood. Atrial pathologies are the most common arrhythmias with atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter being the most prevalent. The number of individuals with atrial fibrillation in the United States is expected to reach 12 million by 2050 while atrial flutter, often a result of ablative treatment, is also expected to rise as more of these treatments are administered. When pharmacological treatment fails, radiofrequency (RF) ablation is warranted, which currently constitutes a lengthy procedure with 55% success rate for single treatments. Ventricular arrhythmias such as ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation denote extremely fast and chaotic rhythms, respectively, and can cause sudden cardiac death. Arrhythmias also increase the risk of heart attack, cardiac arrest and stroke. In addition, arrhythmias can develop to congestive heart failure, i.e., when the heart can no longer produce the expected blood volume output, for which morbidity and mortality rates remain exceptionally high. Of the nearly 5 million HF patients affected in the U.S., mortality is at 50% and 75% at 5 and 10 years of diagnosis, respectively (Heart Failure Society of America). This is mainly because standard HF care such as Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy (CRT) that aims at synchronously pacing the ventricles has a failure rate of 50-70% due to lack of reliable treatment planning. Reliable conduction mapping of the arrhythmic chamber stands to significantly improve its treatment success. To this end, our group has pioneered Electromechanical Wave Imaging (EWI) that characterizes the electromechanical function throughout the four cardiac chambers. In this study, we propose to overcome current limitations by 1) developing and optimizing parallel beamforming for EWI in all four chambers and 2) applying and validating EWI for clinical treatment planning and assessment; more specifically, RF ablation for atrial fibrillation treatment and CRT for heart failure treatment. Therefore, the hypothesis of this study is that EWI with parallel beamforming will have increased sensitivity for characterization of atrial and ventricular arrhythmias for 1) treatment planning and 2) treatment assessment. Should the findings of the proposed study indicate high reliability of EWI for treatment guidance, this novel imaging system could be readily applied in a clinical setting as part of a standard protocol to increase the currently low time efficiency and success rates."
"9471981","Project Summary Cilia are cellular organelles that are essential for human development and health. It has long been known that cilia are organized into structurally and functionally distinct compartments known as the basal body, the transition zone, and the cilia shaft. Nephronophthisis-related ciliopathy (NPHP-RC) proteins localize to subregions within the previously known compartments, revealing a hidden complexity. For example, NPHP2/Inversin localizes to a proximal region of the ciliary shaft called the Inversin Compartment (InvC) that is not identifiable by any ultrastructural features. Despite the profound medical importance of cilia in human health and disease, how the ciliary shaft is spatially and functionally organized remains poorly understood. Identifying mechanisms controlling cilia shaft compartmentalization and understanding the physiological relevance of ciliary territories will be important in identifying therapeutic targets to combat cystic kidney diseases and other ciliopathies. The InvC is conserved in the nematode C. elegans, suggesting that the logic underlying the establishment of the InvC and ciliary compartmentalization is similar in worm and human cilia. In C. elegans, we found that the InvC regulates microtubule patterning and tubulin glutamylation. We also discovered that the Tubulin Code ? via tubulin isotypes and tubulin post-translational modifications ? sculpts ciliary structure, ciliary motor-based transport, and ciliary functions including release of ciliary extracellular vesicles. In this new application, we use C. elegans, an exceptional model for ciliary biology and human ciliopathies, to address the question of how the cilium is spatially and functional organized. First, we will define the origin and function of the InvC and examine the relationship between the InvC and tubulin glutamylation. Second, we determine how the Tubulin Code regulates microtubule ultrastructure, motor-based intraflagellar transport, and specialized ciliary functions. Finally, we will identify new genes and pathways that control ciliary homeostasis and protect against ciliary degeneration. This research will address the medically relevant question of how cilia are structurally and functionally organized in healthy and diseased states, and will provide fundamental insight to the molecules, mechanisms, and functions of ciliary compartmentalization and the Tubulin Code. These studies have direct implications for cystic kidney disease research because many of the genes and pathways explored in our work are associated with ciliopathies."
"9403969","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The primary goal of this proposal is to support Dr. Han Chen's career development in transition from a trainee into an independent researcher in statistical genetics and genomics with expertise in large-scale sequencing association studies for complex diseases and traits, such as cardiovascular, respiratory, metabolic diseases, including Coronary Heart Disease (CHD), hypertension, asthma, Acute Lung Injury / Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ALI/ARDS), Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) and Type 2 Diabetes (T2D). Dr. Chen is currently a postdoctoral research fellow in the Department of Biostatistics at Harvard T. H. Chan School of Public Health, and he has developed statistical methods for genome-wide association studies (GWAS), sequencing association studies and meta-analysis. Minority ethnic groups in the United States such as African- Americans and Hispanic-Americans have previously been underrepresented in genetic association studies. There is an increasingly pressing need to design and conduct GWAS and sequencing studies to better understand, prevent and treat complex diseases in these ethnic groups. To achieve this goal, it is important to develop advanced statistical and computational methods to address the challenges in analyzing these data. Specifically, the applicant proposes to develop statistical and computational methods to 1) account for population structure and relatedness in sequencing studies; and 2) test for genetic heterogeneity and test for gene-environment interaction accounting for heterogeneous environmental effects in trans-ethnic sequencing studies. This will provide new insights into biological functional studies, more accurate disease risk prediction, and advance personalized medicine. The proposed methods will be applied to ongoing sequencing studies for OSA, a condition that affects more than 10% of the population in the United States, especially African- Americans and Hispanic-Americans, and is associated with profound cardio-metabolic morbidity.

"9431084","Project Summary: The principal investigator?s long-term goal is to develop evidence-based emergency care guidelines for management of common cardiovascular conditions--including new atrial fibrillation (AF), and (2) translate these guidelines into practice using dissemination and implementation methods. The overall objective of this K08 Mentored Clinical Career Development Award proposal is to develop the principal investigator into an independent clinical investigator to improve the emergency care of AF patients. This proposal is in keeping with NHLBI?s mission, with the potential to significantly change the paradigm of an acute care emergency department (ED) evaluation by changing the trajectory of care of patients with new AF and improving both short and long-term clinical outcomes. Atrial fibrillation affects more than 2 million Americans, and is associated with significant mortality and morbidity, with an increased risk of stroke, heart failure, and death; in appropriate candidates, oral anticoagulants (OAC) can prevent up to 2/3 of strokes. And yet, there is high inter-variability in ED OAC prescribing for stroke prophylaxis. Existing guidelines pertain to chronic, rather than acute AF?and ED populations are different, with increased mortality and morbidity compared to outpatient populations. Before ED-based prescribing of OACs can be recommended for AF, it is essential to determine whether prognosis and response to treatment for ED patients with new AF are similar to published studies of outpatient patients with chronic AF. To address this objective, we propose a comparative observational study of a clinical cohort of 21 hospitals from a large, demographically diverse, integrated health care system. Aim 1 will describe the incidence, time lag, and predictors of OAC prescribing after an ED discharge diagnosis of new AF. Aim 2 will determine whether validated outpatient risk stratification scores can identify a subgroup of ED patients discharged with new AF at high-risk for adverse events (stroke and death). Aim 3 will compare the rates of adverse events (stroke and death) for patients prescribed ED OACs vs patients not prescribed OACs at their ED visit. The results of this research have the potential to positively impact the more than half-million patients annually who present to US emergency departments with AF. The research and training will allow the PI to gain skills and knowledge in the area of observational comparative effectiveness studies, advanced biostatistics, randomized trials, and dissemination and implementation science needed to develop, evaluate and implement guidelines to improve cardiovascular outcomes for emergency department AF patients."
"9416858","Pharmacogenomics and other ?omics methods are cornerstone technologies that will drive biomarker discovery for the Personalized Medicine revolution. However, these technical advances are not yet uniformly applied, as there is under-representation in personalized medicine (PM) research that cuts across ages, genders, racial minorities, and socioeconomic groups. This is particularly true for American Indian and Alaska Native (AI/AN) populations, which are critical communities to involve in discovery research for several reasons. First, these populations have been neglected to date, partly due to a lack of community engagement and historical mistrust around the scientific enterprise. Second, these oftentimes isolated populations can have differences in the prevalence of known, function-disrupting gene variants of clinical significance and/or may possess novel variants with altered function. Third, the effects of unique dietary and other environmental influences among these AI/AN populations on drug response may be modified by genetic variation. We address these issues in Aims 1-3 of Project 2 of our Program Project grant, which seeks a better understanding of the relationship between novel measurements of short- and long-term hepatic vitamin K status, variation in vitamin K cycle genes, and warfarin anticoagulation outcomes. Warfarin is still the most commonly used drug in its pharmacological class in the US and has enormous clinical utility for AI/AN populations, who have more restricted access to emergency hospital facilities and expensive new anticoagulant medications. In Aim 1 we will develop more sensitive and specific biomarkers of hepatic vitamin K status than the existing plasma ELISA-based PIVKA-II and vitamin K assays, using LC-MS/MS-based approaches to quantitate all eleven (proteo)forms of carboxylated prothrombin (Factor II) in plasma and CYP4F2-dependent vitamin K catabolites in urine. This is biologically significant because hepatic vitamin K levels affect Factor II proteoform synthesis and several undercarboxylated proteoforms have clotting factor activity. In Aim 2, we will use our enhanced assays to (A) characterize short- and long-term hepatic vitamin K status in three AI/AN populations and test its association with CYP4F2*3 and (B) directly test whether the gene variant modifies the effect of vitamin K supplementation on hepatic vitamin K status. In Aim 3, we will test whether prospectively applied pharmacogenetic and biomarkers tests of hepatic vitamin K status are associated with long-term hemostasis control in AI/AN (and all other) populations receiving warfarin-based anticoagulation therapy. These aims are highly clinically significant. Specifically, they will enhance our understanding of the regulation of hepatic vitamin K status, and by inference all human vitamin K-dependent Gla proteins, by CYP4F2. The results may also further the development of a new decision tree for warfarin versus DOAC therapy based on the aforementioned PM test results.s."
"9481627","Project Summary  The goal of this study is to develop and pilot test an integrated microeconomic (ME) intervention to reduce the risk of HIV transmission among economically disadvantaged male-to-female (MTF) transgender women (TGW). While some psychosocial interventions have been implemented for TGW, most lack rigorous evaluation data and/or economic determinants are largely unaddressed. Despite the high estimated HIV prevalence (>25%) among U.S. TGW (and up to 50% in African-American TGW), they have nevertheless not been targeted in the few available ME initiatives for HIV prevention. Recent studies suggest that there are a variety of factors contributing to HIV vulnerability in TGW, including economic and structural barriers such as experiencing discrimination in employment and housing and the high cost of medical and clinical services required for male-to-female transition, all of which lead to financial instability and reliance on high-risk income generation; and being victims of sexual violence and having much higher incidence of psychiatric symptoms and substance use, all linked to higher HIV prevalence and transmission. It is estimated that TGW are three times as likely as the general population to be unemployed; four times as likely to be unstably housed; and twice as likely to be poor. TGW of color especially experience these disadvantages.  To address high rates of HIV and the related economic disadvantage of TGW (including many TGW of color), this study will use a two group experimental design to develop and longitudinally assess an integrated ME intervention tailored for economically disadvantaged TGW who are also behaviorally at risk for HIV. Microeconomic interventions, defined as very small-scale initiatives to improve the financial status of individuals have been shown in low-income countries to improve protective sexual behaviors, and HIV communication and testing, by combining HIV education and financial training, mentoring, and economic resources. Consistent with these results, we will finalize and evaluate the intervention via three project aims: Aim 1: Conduct formative work with TGW and key informants to assess TGW?s current experiences and preferences for each of the possible ME components (including supportive economic services, employment readiness and financial training, gender transition supports, and economics-based HIV education). Aim 2: Develop an integrated ME intervention for HIV prevention tailored for economically disadvantaged TGW which addresses multiple economic vulnerabilities in two U.S., HIV-prevalent, and resource-poor metropolitan areas (Richmond, VA and the St. Louis MO/IL metro area.) Aim 3: Using a randomized experimental study design, assess the feasibility and efficacy of the integrated ME for economically disadvantaged U.S. TGW in reducing economic vulnerability and HIV sexual risk-taking.  The ultimate goal of this R34 project is to establish a feasible, acceptable, and scalable microeconomic intervention for HIV reduction in U.S. TGW communities to test within a larger, subsequent RCT."
"9378101","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Since the aging population is growing at an unprecedented pace, the number of Veterans diagnosed with dementia is estimated to increase dramatically. Identification of individuals before the onset of significant clinical symptoms is essential for facilitating intervention when therapies may be most effective. One approach to identifying potential biomarkers of prodromal dementia involves assessing brain structure in individuals at increased risk for developing Alzheimer's disease (AD), such as those with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). With a recent explosion in MCI research, it has become clear that it is a heterogeneous disorder and distinct clinical subtypes (e.g., amnestic, nonamnestic) have been proposed. Heterogeneity in the clinical presentation of MCI may relate in part to the heterogeneity of underlying neuropathological mechanism(s). Although debated, evidence suggests that individuals with amnestic MCI demonstrate greater medial temporal lobe damage typical of early AD (e.g., Singh et al., 2006). In contrast, those with nonamnestic MCI show greater frontal lobe involvement (Nobili et al., 2008) and greater cerebrovascular disease (as evidenced by white matter abnormalities) on MRI (Delano-Wood et al., 2009). Mixed MCI characterized by impairment in multiple domains of cognitive ability may represent individuals with mixed pathology with both neurodegenerative and cerebrovascular features (Libon et al., 2010). Taken together, previous studies highlight a complex relationship between MCI, white matter, AD pathology, and cerebrovascular functioning. The proposed study will combine imaging markers of white matter abnormalities and vascular risk markers with AD-related biomarkers (e.g., cerebrospinal fluid [CSF] measures of amyloid and tau, hippocampal volume) as well as take into account MCI clinical subtypes in order to more completely characterize the contributions of AD and cerebrovascular risk to the dementia prodrome. In doing so, we can compare the prevailing model of biomarkers of MCI and AD, which emphasizes neurodegeneration (e.g., Jack et al., 2013) with a model relating the combined effects of vascular and AD pathologies to the probability of developing dementia (Chui et al., 2012). The current study aims to (1) better characterize the structural brain changes and vascular risk profiles underlying distinct MCI subtypes, (2) critically examine novel neuroimaging measures that might distinguish MCI subtypes and contribute to the nature and severity of cognitive impairment, and (3) determine which neuroimaging markers of white and gray matter alterations and additional risk factors for dementia (i.e., vascular risk factors, APOE ?4 status) are most useful in predicting cognitive decline and progression to dementia. In the proposed study, 92 older adults (23 cognitively normal, 23 amnestic MCI, 23 nonamnestic MCI, and 23 mixed/multiple domain MCI) will undergo comprehensive neuropsychological assessment; laboratory testing to assess vascular risk factors (e.g., fasting glucose); CSF measurement of amyloid and tau; and neuroimaging exams including high resolution structural, perfusion, and white matter imaging. White matter imaging protocols include T2-weighted fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) as well as two cutting edge techniques: diffusional kurtosis imaging (DKI) and a novel, myelin-selective technique (multi-component driven equilibrium single pulse observation of T1 and T2 [mcDESPOT]). It is hypothesized that greater vascular risk burden and white matter changes in frontal regions will be associated with nonamnestic MCI and mixed/multiple domain MCI. In contrast, white matter changes in medial temporal lobe regions will be associated with amnestic MCI and mixed/multiple domain MCI. A better understanding of the underlying neuropathology associated with distinct MCI clinical subtypes and the implementation of multimodal neuroimaging markers that better detect heterogeneous pathologies may have important implications for diagnosis, prognosis, treatment selection, and monitoring of disease-modifying effects of therapy as well as selection criteria for clinical trials."
"9386756","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Coronary heart disease is the leading cause of death in the U.S., and patients who survive a coronary artery occlusion have a high risk for cardiac arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death. Spatial heterogeneity of sympathetic transmission is a major contributor to post-infarct arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death after myocardial infarction (MI), and sympathetic denervation predicted arrhythmia risk in recent human studies.  We have identified two distinct types of sympathetic denervation after MI: 1) persistent denervation of the infarct/scar and adjacent border zone myocytes, and 2) transient denervation of uninjured peri-infarct myocardium. This proposal will develop methods to prevent or reverse both types of denervation, and determine if restoring sympathetic innervation throughout the ventricle decreases arrhythmia susceptibility. The infarct remains denervated after MI due to chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs). We identified protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor sigma (PTP?as the major CSPG receptor in sympathetic neurons, and found that removing PTP?esulted in reinnervation of the border zone and hyperinnervation of the cardiac scar. Preliminary data suggest that eliminating PTP?ormalizes cardiac electrophysiology and renders hearts surprisingly resistant to post-MI arrhythmias. This suggests that restoring sympathetic innervation has a beneficial effect on arrhythmia susceptibility. However, it's not clear if re-innervation is the key to preventing arrhythmias, or if other actions of PTP?ontribut to decreased arrhythmia susceptibility in PTP?- hearts. We hypothesize that the major action of PTP?s to prevent reinnervation via interactions with CSPGs (Aim 1), and that restoring sympathetic innervation will decrease arrhythmia susceptibility (Aim 2). Peri-infarct myocardium is transiently denervated 1 and 3 days after MI and loss of sympathetic fibers outside the infarct requires activation of the p75 neurotrophin receptor. We identified ProNGF and a form of Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor (either proBDNF or BDNF) as p75 ligands that are elevated in the heart after MI. We will test the hypothesis that pro-neurotrophins and/or BDNF stimulate peri-infarct denervation, and that preventing peri- infarct denervation will decrease arrhythmia susceptibility (Aim 3).  We have assembled an outstanding team of experts along with unique animal models and novel genetic tools to assist us in completing these studies. This work will test directly if manipulating cardiac nerves after MI can normalize cardiac electrophysiology and decrease arrhythmia frequency, opening a new avenue for therapeutic development."

"9472465","ABSTRACT Improved Detection of Prostate Cancer with New Nanoparticle-based Ultrasound Contrast Agents  Targeted to PSMA Prostate cancer (PCa) biopsies are commonly performed using ultrasound (US) guidance, but the delineation of tumors within the prostate with US is not clear. This has led to rising morbidity from current standard of care biopsies that are not aimed at a specific target but rather typical locations where cancer may be found. Imaging of the location of the tumor within the gland and the peri-glandular space would significantly impact the staging of the disease. The development of a new tool to accurately depict cancer within the prostate is thus urgently needed to aid in staging and biopsy guidance. To meet this need, this proposal will develop targeted US contrast agents, which can extravasate to PCa cells and can delineate a target lesion of concern more effectively than current standard of care. Prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA) is an ideal target to detect PCa due to its abundant expression in most prostate cancers. To provide a better, practical tool for clear identification of PCa for biopsy, we have developed a nano-sized US contrast agent (called a nanobubble ? NB) targeted to PSMA via a new, highly specific small molecule-based ligand. The targeted NBs, are similar in structure to clinically used microbubbles (MB) and are clearly visible on clinical US. In contrast to MB which remain in the vasculature, the <120 nm NB size enables them extravasate and directly bind to cancer cells. This can result in higher accumulation of contrast at the tumor itself leading to better resolution and detection of PCa. The PSMA-targeted agent has the capacity to revolutionize PCa imaging, since US is so broadly available, low cost, and safe. Importantly, US is already frequently utilized in PCa biopsy procedures. The objective of this research is development of a uniquely capable contrast agent for enhanced detection and delineation of PCa with US using two complementary tactics: 1) detection of PSMA on the surface of prostate cancer cells after targeted NB extravasation and 2) monitoring differences in contrast agent dynamics in tumor versus normal prostate tissue. We hypothesize that PSMA-targeted NBs can target PCa cells directly and will thus be more effective at detecting and delineating PCa within and outside of the prostate gland than MBs. We propose four specific aims to support the project objectives: Aim 1 will determine the optimal formulation parameters for the NBs. We seek a stable formulation that will be successfully targeted to PSMA with high yield. The formulation needs to be visible on US and sustain its signal for at least 1 hour to allow for the biopsy procedure to take place. Bubbles will be characterized by dynamic light scattering, confocal microscopy and US. In vitro binding efficacy and cell uptake will be screened in cell culture. Aim 2 will maximize ultrasound NB signal in PSMA positive and negative flank tumors in mice and compare performance to MBs that are clinically available. Aim 3 will examine performance of the NBs in a clinically relevant orthotopic model. We will acquire contrast enhanced images and will then utilize 3D whole mouse cryoimaging to determine the efficacy of segmentation of the tumor and prostate tissue and directly compare histology and location of PCa determined using US imaging. Finally, in Aim 4, we will test the strategy in a dog model of prostate cancer. It is our hope that PSMA-targeted NBs will depict the pattern of primary tumor within or outside the prostate gland and inform planning for biopsy and surgical approaches. Correlation of Pca and US signal will be made in vivo with MRI of the dogs and then confirmed ex vivo using pathology. Improved biopsies and cancer localization will lead to increased detection of high grade tumors and tumor staging, and lower morbidity."
"9447738","Project Summary  In the proposed studies we seek to disentangle the complex effects of intracellular calcium in the regulation of airway smooth muscle (ASM) contraction. Although biochemical events mediating the effects of calcium on cross-bridge cycling and contraction have been understood and accepted for years, what remains mystifying is how the ASM cell compartmentalizes calcium to regulate the contractile machinery. Our recent findings demonstrate that conventional and simplistic assessments of intracellular calcium signaling have no predictive ability regarding regulation of smooth muscle contractile state. In recent publications we demonstrate the seemingly paradoxical ability of elevated intracellular calcium to mediate relaxation of ASM when stimulated by agonists of bitter taste receptors (TAS2Rs) whereas almost all other G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) capable of inducing increased intracellular calcium mediate contraction. Similarly, ligands such as natural flavonoids, chloride channel antagonists, GABAA agonists cause acute ASM relaxation despite causing an acute transient [Ca2+]i increase. Clearly, the disparate effects by GPCRs on ASM contractile state reflect the long-appreciated but poorly-understood ability of the cell to compartmentalize calcium signaling. The relaxant effect of calcium signaling, if understood, could be exploited therapeutically for the management of the airway hyperresponsiveness. To achieve our goal we will combine expertise and strategies in 5 major areas: GPCR biology, biophysics of calcium, cell imaging, proteomics and mathematical modeling. Aim 1 studies will define the mechanisms involved in spatial and temporal distribution of calcium signaling in ASM induced by different GPCR agonists. We will define and localize all proteins, structural elements, and enzymatic activities that regulate calcium distribution in ASM cells stimulated with different GPCR agonists. We will test how disruption of these regulatory elements alters the features of intracellular calcium and the associated regulation of ASM tone. In aim 2 studies, we will employ hyperspectral imaging and phosphoproteomics tools to discern GPCR- specific activation of effector proteins in ASM. With these data we will develop descriptive and predictive mathematical models (Aim 3) that define the key regulatory features enabling compartmentalized calcium signaling and predict the functional consequences of such signaling. The computational models will be validated using experimental data obtained through studies using primary human airway smooth muscle cells and tissues. Our success banks on the unique ability of our team to creatively apply and coordinate cutting edge imaging approaches, multi-fluorophore hyperspectral image analysis, and modeling to well-defined experimental systems that demonstrate disparate and unexplained functional consequences of intracellular calcium. The findings will not only advance the basic science fields of receptor biology and calcium signaling, but also identify targets whose manipulation could be exploited for developing novel bronchodilator therapies."

"9393543","Project Summary: Human Alcohol Seeking Despite Aversion Prolonged alcohol use results in neuroadaptations leading to decreased sensitivity to alcohol, a shift from positive to negative reinforcement-based alcohol use, increased negative affect that drives further consumption, and, ultimately, aversion-resistant drinking. Aversion resistant drinking is a hallmark of more severe and treatment-resistant persistent alcohol use. It has been widely studied in animal models, but has not been well characterized in humans. This project aims to develop an objective measure of aversion resistant drinking in humans, modeled as alcohol self-administration despite aversion, and to characterize its underlying neural signatures. The positive impact of this project will be to advance the translation between preclinical models and clinical models, and to elucidate distinct mechanisms underlying alcohol use disorder progression in humans."
"9439608","Project Summary/Abstract Breast cancer (BC) has several distinct molecular subtypes, including estrogen receptor (ESR1) positive and triple negative BC (TNBC). A significant proportion of ESR1-positive therapy sensitive-BCs (TS-BC) initially respond to antiestrogens or aromatase inhibitors, but become therapy resistant-BCs (TR-BC) and progress to incurable metastases. Further, TNBC subtype has a more aggressive clinical course and lack targeted therapies. Development of effective therapies for women with TR-BC and TNBCs represents the highest unmet need. Recent studies revealed the potential role of several members of the Nuclear Receptor (NR) superfamily as molecular drivers in TR-BC and TNBC, including the androgen receptor (AR), glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and the orphan NR tailless (TLX, NR2E1). The specificity and magnitude of NR signaling is mediated by the interaction between NR and critical coregulators and depending on the molecular context in which NRs and NR coregulators are altered, they may contribute to BC progression. The variability of the contribution of specific NRs and NR coregulators to disease progression in TR-BCs and TNBCs poses a therapeutic challenge but also an opportunity for agents that can target multiple NRs and NR coregulators. We have developed a first-in-class polyfunctional small molecules, ERXs that have activity in the TR-BCs and TNBCs. ERXs block NR and coregulator interactions. Uniquely, our preliminary studies identified three lead compounds with differential activity to distinct BC molecular subtypes: ERX-11 (activity against TS-BC, TR-BCs), ERX-41 (activity against TS-BCs, TR-BCs and TNBCs) and ERX-1113 (activity against TNBC only). The objective of this proposal is to further develop lead ERXs to treat TR-BC and TNBC. Our overarching hypothesis is that targeting the NR- coregulator interactome will have therapeutic utility in treating TR-BC and TNBC. Our initial preliminary studies indicated that ERX-11 targets ESR1, while the molecular targets of ERX-41 and ERX-1113 are not yet defined. In Aim1, we will determine the mechanism of action of ERX derivatives using a novel forward genetics approach to identify the molecular target(s) of ERX compounds in ESR1+ BC and TNBCs and establish the molecular interactome using unbiased mass spectroscopy-based approaches and whole genome sequencing approaches. In Aim2 we will optimize the translatability of ERX derivatives and conduct detailed PK, PD, tolerability and toxicity studies on lead ERX compounds. In Aim3, we will test of the efficacy of ERX compounds in using patient derived explant tissues, endocrine resistant models, and by using syngeneic, orthotopic xenografts and in patient derived xenografts (PDX). This proposal is innovative as ERXs block multiple critical protein-protein interactions, and uniquely have activity against a large number of TR-BC and TNBC cell lines. Successful completion of the proposed studies will lead to the development of first-in-class cancer therapy drugs that addresses the critical need of targeting TR-BC and TNBC."
"9445110","Project Summary  The development and formation of normal and abnormal vasculature is of critical importance to both normal biology and disease pathogenesis. Recent studies from our and other laboratories have demonstrated the importance of syndecans in regulation of heparan-binding growth factors signaling on endothelial cells. Yet, despite the impressive degree of syndecan- dependent regulation of VEGF signaling, there is a very limited understanding of how this is accomplished. In preliminary studies, we have observed abnormal developmental angiogenesis in mice missing syndecan-2 and abnormal lymphatic morphogenesis in mice missing syndecan- 4. Furthermore, signaling studies point to VEGFA specificity for syndecan-2 and VEGFC specificity for syndecan-4. We propose to determine relative contributions of Syndecan-2 and Syndecan-4 to, respectively, VEGFR2-driven angiogenesis and VEGFR3-driven lymphangiogenesis both in development and in adult settings. The understanding of accounts for these signaling specificities would open-up the possibility of selectively targeting angiogenesis vs. lymphangiogenesis in a number of settings and, be, potentially, of tremendous clinical significance."
"9445690","ABSTRACT Voltage-gated sodium (Nav) channels initiate action potentials in the heart, and voltage-gated calcium (Cav) channels initiate excitation-contraction coupling. They are related proteins with a common evolutionary ancestor, and they are molecular targets for Class I and Class IV antiarrhythmic drugs (AADs) used in control of life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias. The structural basis for AAD action is unknown. We have determined the crystal structure of an ancestral bacterial Nav channel (NavAb) at 2.7 Å resolution and revealed the structural basis for voltage sensing, pore opening and closing, ion selectivity, and slow inactivation. This structure also revealed fenestrations that lead laterally from the lipid bilayer into the pore and provide an access pathway for entry of pore-blocking AADs. We constructed a Ca-selective form of NavAb, termed CavAb, and used this construct to reveal the structural basis for Ca selectivity at atomic resolution. We are now focusing on the structural basis for state-dependent block of Nav and Cav channels by AADs. CavAb is blocked by all three structural subclasses of Class IV AADs in a state-dependent manner with nM affinity. We found that the phenylalkylamine verapamil binds to a receptor site in the pore, at the inner end of the ion selectivity filter, and physically blocks it. In contrast, amlodipine and other dihydropyridines bind at a site on the lipid-facing outer surface of the pore module, at the interface between two voltage-sensing modules, and allosterically block the pore. These results reveal drug-receptor complexes of Cav channels for the first time and set the stage for complete analysis of the mechanism of state-dependent block of Nav and Cav channels at the atomic level. Our proposed experiments have three goals. 1. We will build upon strong preliminary data to reveal the high-resolution structure of the therapeutically important benzothiazepine diltiazem bound to its receptor site in the pore of CavAb, compare the chemistry of its binding to verapamil, determine the role of fenestrations in state-dependent block of CavAb, and explore the effects of mutations that substitute human residues in the AAD receptor site. 2. We will build on strong preliminary data to reveal the high- resolution structures of Class 1 AADs such as lidocaine and flecainide bound to NavAb, differentiate among the binding poses and receptor site conformations for Subclass 1A, 1B, and 1C AADs, determine the role of fenestrations in state- dependent block of NavAb, and explore the effects of mutations that humanize the NavAb drug receptor. 3. Based on a new homogeneous biochemical preparation, we will use cryo-electron microscopy and X-ray crystallography to determine the structure of a mammalian cardiac Nav1.5 channel at high resolution, define the structural basis for its unique physiological properties, and elucidate the structural basis for AAD block of Nav1.5 channels. Our results will be crucial for understanding and improving therapy of life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias by AADs."
"9468648","Experience robustly regulates the development and function of GABAergic inhibitory circuits in cerebral cortex, but the purpose of this inhibitory circuit plasticity is unclear. Recent findings in rodent somatosensory (S1) and visual cortex suggest that inhibitory plasticity may contribute to homeostatic stabilization of firing rate in cortical networks. We recently discovered that during competitive map plasticity in S1, sensory deprivation weakens parvalbumin (PV) inhibitory circuits very rapidly (< 1 day). This is faster than classical homeostatic mechanisms like synaptic scaling, and promotes firing rate stability in the S1 network. We propose that PV circuit plasticity functions as a rapid, bidirectional homeostat, operating on the time scale of hours, and that its role is to stabilize cortical firing rate. We propose that it accomplishes this by adaptively altering PV circuit gain and excitation-inhibition (E-I) ratio in local pyramidal cells as a function of the recent history of network activity. This rapid inhibitory plasticity may be a major contributor to controlling firing rate in cerebral cortex. Here, we test this hypothesis, using L2/3 of mouse whisker S1 cortex as a model system. In Aim 1, we use slice physiology and layer-specific optogenetics to measure how whisker deprivation alters the gain of L4-L2/3 feedforward and L2/3-L2/3 recurrent inhibitory circuits, and quantify the dynamics of this plasticity. We test whether direct chemogenetic modulation of pyramidal cell firing rate induces inhibitory circuit plasticity, whether this is bidirectional, and whether it is general across cortical areas. In Aim 2, we use dual whole-cell recording to identify the specific synaptic and cellular changes that mediate rapid inhibitory plasticity in PV and Somatostatin (SOM) circuits. In Aim 3, we use 2-photon calcium imaging and chronic extracellular unit recording to characterize firing rate homeostasis in L2/3, determine its magnitude and dynamics across age, and measure its relationship to inhibitory circuit plasticity. Breakdown of inhibitory homeostasis could contribute to circuit dysfunction in autism, schizophrenia, and other disorders. In Aim 4, we test this hypothesis by asking whether inhibition or inhibitory homeostasis is disrupted in cortex in several transgenic mouse models of autism. Preliminary data show that excitation-inhibition ratio is disrupted in common across four genetically unrelated mouse models. This provides key support for the long-held E-I ratio model of autism. Overall, this project will reveal whether inhibitory circuit plasticity is an important mechanism for rapid homeostasis of cortical firing rate, and whether its disruption may contribute to neurological disease."

The overall objectives of this proposal are to: 1) develop a modeling framework for analyzing multivariate longitudinal data and build an increasingly more sophisticated class of models that account for known, and currently ignored, problems in the data; 2) provide fast inferential and statistically principled approaches to inference; 3) develop a class of sensitivity analysis approaches to modeling choices; 4) develop tools for personalized dynamic predictions to facilitate targeted treatments; 5) apply these methods to data from current clinical trials; and 6) develop and standardize the newly proposed approaches via professional software development and web deployment. Our methods of defining and estimating the overall treatment effects in multivariate longitudinal data address the critical need across trials of many medical conditions (e.g., Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease) with a similar data structure."
"9439151","Glioblastoma cells trigger pharmacoresistant seizures that may promote tumor growth and diminish the quality of remaining life. To define the relationship between growth of glial tumors and their neuronal microenvironment, and to identify genomic biomarkers and mechanisms that may point to better prognosis and treatment of drug resistant epilepsy in brain cancer, we are analyzing a new generation of genetically defined CRISPR/in utero electroporation inborn glioblastoma (GBM) tumor models engineered in mice. The molecular pathophysiology of glioblastoma cells and surrounding neurons and untransformed astrocytes will be compared at serial stages of tumor development in three genetic mouse strains: wild type, seizure prone, and seizure resistant. Preliminary data reveal that epileptiform EEG spiking is a very early and reliable preclinical signature of GBM expansion preceding other neurological deficits in these mice, followed by rapidly progressive seizures and death within weeks. Transcriptomic analysis of cortical astrocytes reveals the expansion of a subgroup enriched in pro-synaptogenic genes that may drive hyperexcitability, a novel mechanism of epileptogenesis. In Specific Aim 1 we will systematically define the earliest appearance of cortical hyperexcitability in wild type mice with a prototypical GBM and correlate its progression with in vivo and neuropathological imaging of invasive tumor cell location, in vitro electrophysiology, and molecular markers of key epilepsy pathogenic cascades in peritumoral neurons, including impaired glutamate reuptake, altered GABA gated-chloride gradients, and synaptic densities. In Specific Aim 2 we will correlate these findings with detailed FACS-sorted transcriptomic profiles of both transformed and wild type astrocytes in the peritumoral region to test the novel hypothesis that peritumoral hyperexcitability is driven in part by astrocytic subtypes that disrupt synaptic E/I homeostasis. In Specific Aim 3, we will use this benchmark approach in WT brain to compare growth, electrophysiological and molecular pathological profiles of the same tumor generated in a hyperexcitable brain bearing a single gene deletion (Kcna1) that dramatically lowers the threshold for seizures and shortens lifespan, and in a monogenic deletion strain (MapT/tau) that raises cortical seizure threshold and prolongs life, in order to examine the contribution of host neuronal excitability to tumor expansion. Our approach sets the stage to broadly explore the developmental biology of personalized tumor/host interactions in mice engineered with novel human tumor mutations in specified glial cell lineages."

"9436275","Project Summary CD4+ T cells (TCD4+) recognize antigens in the form of peptides (epitopes) bound to cell surface MHC class II molecules (MHC-II) and are critical for the development of protection against most pathogens. Decades of work with nominal protein antigens has produced a standard model of peptide generation and presentation: Internalized antigen is digested and loaded onto nascent MHC-II-bound peptides in a late endosomal compartment followed by transit of the resulting complexes to the cell surface. In recent years, as work has extended to more complex antigens, it has become apparent that there are multiple alternatives to this classical ?exogenous? pathway, including a poorly understood ?endogenous? processing ?network? comprised of antigen processing machinery beyond the endocytic compartment and a transfer pathway in which antigen is conveyed from the infected APC to an uninfected APC. Indeed, our recent work with influenza has demonstrated that epitopes produced by the endogenous MHCII processing network drives the vast majority of the TCD4+ response to an influenza infection, while those produced by antigen transfer make a minor contribution. Here we propose to study the roles of these alternative mechanisms in TCD4+ responses to Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (S. Typhimurium), which injects a number of proteins into the host cell cytosol as part of the infection program. Based upon our recent work and that of others, we hypothesize that: 1) TCD4+ responses to S. Typhimurium are focused upon these secreted proteins (SPs), and 2) SPs are processed primarily by the endogenous network and secondarily by antigen transfer, the contribution of the former being dampened by the Salmonella-encoded SteD protein, which down-modulates MHC-II levels in the infected cell. In Aim 1 we will assess the relative contributions to the global TCD4+ of SPs, vs. 2 classes of structural proteins (cytosolic and fimbrial) and the influence of SteD on this balance. Subsequently, we will explore the importance of delivery to the host cell cytosol for efficient epitope generation. Complementing this approach, in Aim 2, through the use of knockout mice, knockdown strategies, and chemical inhibitors we will identify in vivo and in vitro the cellular components that contribute to the generation of individual S. Typhimurium epitopes from the three classes of protein. Together, these Aims will elucidate the origins of S. Typhimurium epitopes, and the processing pathways that facilitate their presentation to TCD4+ cells. Our expectation is that the outcomes of this exploratory R21 project will: 1) further guide the field toward a more complex view of MHC-II processing and presentation, 2) reveal an elegantly simple system for distinguishing between pathogenic and non-pathogenic bacteria, and 3) provide key insights into the rational development of effective vaccines against bacterial pathogens, a high priority considering the recent and alarming developments with respect to antibiotic resistance, and an area we intend to contribute to in building upon the proposed project."
"9397548","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) provide a unique source of stem cells that have the potential to differentiate into any cell type o the body, including retinal ganglion cells. Furthermore, when derived from a patient's own somatic cells, they have the potential to faithfully serve as a model system of glaucoma. Previously, we have shown the ability to derive various retinal cell types including retinal ganglion cells from hiPSCs. In the current proposal, hiPSCs will be derived from patients with normal-tension primary open angle glaucoma, which would constitute a source of cells with a high predisposition to retinal ganglion cell damage. Conversely, wild type hiPSCs will be utilized as a point of comparison which would have a greater resistance to glaucomatous injury. The comparison of retinal ganglion cells derived from these two sources will allow for the identification of factors contributing to glaucoma-related symptoms. To test this hypothesis, retinal ganglion cells derived from both sources will be examined for the accumulation of reactive oxygen species characteristic of a glaucomatous condition, both under control conditions as well as after exposure to environmental stressors such as hydrogen peroxide. Viability of these cells will also be tested through the use of apoptotic assays to identify differences between the two populations. It is expected that such stressors will result in increased apoptotic activity in those cells derived from glaucoma patients compared with those derived from ocular hypertension sources. Additionally, the role of astrocytes in the progression of a glaucomatous phenotype will be tested. Astrocytes will be derived from patient-specific hiPSCs and co-cultured with retinal ganglion cells. Analysis will be performed to determine the extent of astrocyte contribution to the glaucoma disease phenotype. The successful completion of the aims of this proposal will establish patient-specific hiPSC- derived retinal ganglion cells s a valuable model system for studies of glaucoma, and will also serve as a significant basis upon which to design new pharmaceuticals for the treatment of this disease."
"9442890","PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the single largest killer in the United States for both men and women in every racial/ethnic group. Thus, accurate and systematic evaluation of CVD risk represents an aspect of Precision Medicine that will touch every patient. CVD risk scores that are currently the standard of care are derived from research cohorts and are particularly inaccurate in women, older patients, and those with missing data. The goal of this Precision Medicine based application is to capitalize on the depth and breadth of clinical data within electronic health record (EHR) systems to revolutionize CVD risk prediction, thereby optimizing personalized care for every patient. Our proposed approach is innovative in that we have identified and addressed the most significant barriers to development of an EHR-based risk score. Novel aspects of this research include: 1) use of complete EHR data to develop and validate algorithms to define a variety of risk factors (e.g., reproductive history), thus building a comprehensive risk profile for each patient that incorporates diagnosis and procedure codes, laboratory values, clinical test results, patient provided information (e.g., alcohol use), and natural language processing of unstructured clinical text; 2) incorporation of age at onset of risk factors; 3) use of highly flexible machine learning techniques in the form of generalized boosted regression modeling; 4) exploration of a new deep learning model for censored EHR data; and 5) determination of the extent of risk reclassification in multiple geographically-defined populations, including an underserved minority population. Furthermore, genetic studies demonstrate that incorporating variants into current risk models improves risk prediction and use of an individual's genetic risk could further enhance our ability to deliver precision medicine to every patient. Therefore, we seek to develop a sex-specific next-generation CVD risk prediction score using EHR data in combination with genetic variants. This paradigm is a significant departure from the current one that relies on scores derived from relatively small research cohorts that use only a restricted set of clinical parameters that differentially misclassify an individual's risk, especially in women. Our access to empirical clinical EHR data for hundreds of thousands of patients uniquely positions us to 1) develop a sex-specific risk prediction model for incident CVD using data from the EHR; 2) assess the performance of the sex-specific EHR risk score in an independent non-urban and rural population; and 3) identify and characterize patients for whom genetic information improves CVD prediction beyond the clinical risk score. Successful completion of these aims has the potential to impact all adult patients, drive clinical practice changes to systematically collect sex-specific risk factors, and inform attempts to embed the next-generation CVD risk score into EHR systems for automated use in clinical care."

"9450066","SUMMARY Norepinephrine is a neurotransmitter thought to be involved in driving behavioral flexibility. It is released by a small number of neurons throughout the neocortex. Little is known, however, about what signals these neurons provide, and how targets in neocortex use those signals, in the context of well-controlled behaviors in mammals. This proposal aims to determine functions of norepinephrine-releasing neurons in the locus coeruleus, the primary source of forebrain norepinephrine. The behaviors to be studied involve different types of flexibility: the ability to switch between using different sensory modalities to select the relevant one for receiving a reward, and the ability to choose among different alternatives that yield reward with changing probabilities. The goal of the project is to link action potentials from identified norepinephrine-releasing neurons to membrane potential, action potentials, and calcium dynamics, in primary somatosensory cortex and prefrontal cortex, in the context of flexible behavior. Three aims test three hypotheses that address different mechanistic questions about the functions of norepinephrine in neocortex: 1) norepinephrine acts in sensory cortex to modulate the perceptual outcome of a sensory stimulus; 2) norepinephrine regulates switching between relevant sensory modalities; 3) norepinephrine and prefrontal cortex activity correlate with dynamic updating of behavior. Simultaneous measurements of activity of norepinephrine neurons and their targets in neocortex, during well-controlled behavioral tasks in mice, will enable testing these three hypotheses. Ultimately, understanding when and where norepinephrine is released in the brain will be necessary to understand flexible behavior in general, and disorders of attention and mood that rely on norepinephrine signaling."
"9397571","Title: Epigenetic Mechanisms of Developmental Regulation of Fetal, Newborn, and Adult Cerebral Artery Sympathetic Innervation and Alpha1 Adrenergic Receptor Subtypes Project Summary: During the past half century there has been the rising rate of preterm birth combined with a lowering of the age limit of viability. The premature fetus is more prone to germinal matrix and other intracerebral hemorrhage, intraventricular hemorrhage, and related problems as a consequence of stress during the process of birth. In contrast, the term-fetus is able to autoregulate cerebral blood ?ow (CBF) despite the increase in systemic pressure and minimize the occurrence of stress-induced hemorrhages. Recently, we have demonstrated that lack of cerebral blood ?ow (CBF) autoregulation in the premature fetus is associated with immaturity of the sympathetic (adrenergic) system. In concert with this, we also have demonstrated that the adrenergic system undergoes a signi?cant maturation with development. In the proposed studies, we attempt to determine the mechanisms by which the premature fetus can have greater cerebral autoregulation capability, as observed in the newborn lamb. In the ?rst three speci?c aims, ex-vivo, we will examine the role of DNA methylation, histone modi?cations, microRNA, and lncRNA on the expression of the three alpha 1 adrenergic receptor subtypes in premature fetus, near-term fetus, newborn lamb, and adult sheep. In the fourth speci?c aim, in vivo, in the chronically catheterized preterm fetus, near-term fetus, newborn lamb, and adult sheep, we will determine the effect of DNA methylation, histone modi?cations, microRNAs, lncRNA, and alpha 1-adrenergic receptor subtypes in CBF regulation with development in both the sexes. Overall, these studies will provide vital insights in the sympathetic regulation of CBF with development, and suggest approaches to prevent or ameliorate CBF dysregulation."
"9432741","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Exposure to environmental agents including heavy metals, air pollutants, pesticides and radiation induces the formation of aberrant RNA-DNA hybrids termed R-loops. Unresolved R- loops are the cause of DNA damage and genome instability, and are also seen in neurodegenerative diseases, e.g. amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), frontotemporal dementia (FTD), fragile X syndrome, and Friedreich's ataxia. The elimination of these pathological RNA- DNA hybrids is dependent on the Fanconi anemia (FA) pathway of DNA damage response and on the tumor suppressors BRCA1 and BRCA2. Recent studies have also implicated several nucleic acid motor proteins, namely, FANCM, Senataxin (SETX), and Aquarius (AQR), in R-loop resolution. AQR is the least understood among these motor proteins and the mechanism by which AQR helps resolve R-loops remains elusive. We hypothesize that AQR engages and dissociates R-loop structures to prevent their accumulation in cells. In this project, we will apply our considerable expertise in molecular studies of nucleic acid motor proteins to define the mechanism by which AQR functions in the R-loop resolution and genome preservation. In Aim 1, we will purify AQR, investigate its association with R-loop structures, and test its ability to dissociate these structures. Mutants of AQR defective in nucleic acid binding or ATP hydrolysis will be generated to establish the relevance of these attributes in vitro and in cells. In Aim 2, we will identify cofactors of AQR, purify them, and define their influence on AQR's activity in R-loop dissociation in reconstituted biochemical systems and in cells. The results from our project will shed light on a poorly understood pathway of genome preservation and are expected to contribute toward the development of novel strategies to avoid the accumulation of R-loops upon exposure to environmental stress and mutagens, and to treat human diseases including neurodegeneration and cancer."
"9447614","Project Summary/Abstract Acute myocardial infarction (MI) is complicated by the subsequent development of scar tissue leading to chronic cardiac insufficiency. Unfortunately, the lack of treatments for this maladaptive fibrotic response often leads to a poor prognosis. Early attempts at stem cell delivery and biological therapeutics to address this problem have been promising, but inconsistent. To meet this challenge, the Desai lab, with collaborators, has developed a unique system of randomly dispersed polymeric microstructures, termed microrods, that have been found to decrease fibroblast proliferation and promote cardiomyocyte hypertrophy in vitro. The objective of this proposal is to study the mechanisms of interaction between microrods and cardiac fibroblasts in vitro and in an animal models of infarct. We will also examine the effect of microstructures on cardiac remodeling. This will enable the design of more effective therapies to prevent the development of cardiac scar tissue and encourage recovery of heart function after MI. Based on previous studies and recent research on the mechanical microenvironment, it is hypothesized that primary adult ventricular fibroblasts will respond to the presence of microrods with a unique set of transcriptional changes in pathways relevant to mechanotransduction, micro-environmental interaction, and extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition. In Aim 1, quantitative analyses of changes in gene expression and immunofluorescence microscopy will be used to examine cellular interactions with microrods in 3D culture. Specifically, quantification of ECM down-regulation and mechanotransductive interactions will elucidate the mechanisms of effect of microstructures on fibroblasts. In addition, HepIII conjugated microrods will be developed in order to augment vascularization, another key element of cardiac regeneration. Aim 2 will use quantitative biochemical and immunohistochemical techniques in an established rat model of MI to test the hypothesis that microrod injection into the infarct zone will produce similar transcriptional changes in markers of the fibrotic response as seen in vitro through interaction with the cardiac fibroblast population, as well as angiogenesis produced with the addition of HepIII to the microrods. Finally, Aim 3 will evaluate the therapeutic benefit of injected microrods in the setting of chronic ischemic cardiomyopathy as suggested by preliminary in vivo results. Therapeutic effect after microrod injection will be measured by serial echocardiograms to assess ejection fraction and cardiac anatomy in relation to the infarct scar and angiogenesis. By decreasing fibrotic scarring, inducing angiogenesis and promoting myocardial regeneration, injectable microrods will contribute to improving outcomes after MI. Understanding these mechanisms will lead to the design and optimization of complementary therapies and drug delivery possibilities, which will further the NHLBI's mission of treating heart disease to enhance the health of all individuals so that they can live longer and more fulfilling lives."
"9393536","Project Summary: Information Dissemination Core  Alcohol use disorders (AUDs) are among the top 5 modifiable factors leading to premature death. We have devoted much effort in past cycles to development of educational materials for the medical and legal professions related to recognition of AUDs, most recently assisting in the implementation of screening, brief intervention, and referral to treatment (SBIRT) in Indianapolis's public hospital system. There is a critical need to understand why medical and (perhaps) legal professionals do not take a more active role in their approach to patients identified as having hazardous alcohol use, and particularly, and what can be done to improve the very low rate of medication-assisted treatment (MAT) to help patients reduce their drinking.  Our objective is to learn about barriers in medical and legal systems to active treatment of hazardous drinking, and test the ability of education about and reminders to improve outcomes (use of MAT and referral of clients to alcohol assessment). The central hypothesis is that a combination of education and reminders in the medical and court record systems will increase the prescription rates of drugs to reduce alcohol use and the referral of patients with possible AUDs to assessment from the courts.  Our specific aims are to: a) survey a wide variety of medical providers, behavioral health specialists, pharmacists, administrative leadership, and patients (and parents of minors) in the Eskenazi Health system about their knowledge of effectiveness of MAT for hazardous drinking, their reasons for not prescribing or authorizing drugs for these patients, and educate them about the evidence for treatment effectiveness; b) survey judges about their practices regarding ordering assessments and treatment of defendants for alcohol and drug abuse, and compare these results with case reviews. We will test an intervention that includes education about the effectiveness of alcohol and drug treatment and computer-generated reminders for referral; and c) develop an education module and computer-generated reminders for the use of MAT for AUDs and test their effect in a large, urban primary care network, targeting groups less often screened including adolescents and young women.  The expected outcomes are better understanding of the barriers to use of MAT for alcohol abuse, and increased use of these drugs when triggered by reminders. We expect that the e-textbook will be widely used by law students and judges, and targeted reminders will increase the percentage of individuals involved in alcohol-related crimes who are referred for assessment. The positive impact of this work will be a reduction in the number of individuals with hazardous drinking progressing to compulsive drinking.  "

"9591420","PROJECT SUMMARY  The most frequent DNA lesion caused by oxidative stress is 8-oxo-7,8-dihydroguanine (8-oxodG) and it is often associated with neurodegenerative diseases including PD and aging processes. In terminally differentiated cells like neurons, 8-oxodG DNA lesions in the transcribed strand of an active gene could be bypassed by RNA polymerase II, and generate erroneous proteins through a process called transcriptional mutagenesis. Studies have reported selective increase of 8-oxodG in the substantia nigra dopaminergic neurons of PD brain tissue. Decreased activity of the 8-oxodG-specific repair enzyme, 8-oxoguanine-DNA glycosylase (OGG1), was also documented in PD and aging conditions.  Coding region of human SNCA contains 43 potential sites for transcriptional mutagenesis. We recently found that oxidative stress or Ogg1 knockdown increase transcriptional mutagenesis of ?-SYN, leading to protein ag- gregation. Moreover using a novel technique, RNase H2-dependent PCR, we were able to identify various TM- generated ?-SYN mutants including S42Y and A53E from human PD brain samples. We have also found S42Y- positive Lewy bodies from postmortem brain samples of PD and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) using highly specific anti-S42Y antibody. Together, our preliminary results strongly suggest that transcriptional mutagenesis contributes to generation of novel pathogenic species of ?-SYN in 8-oxodG accumulation conditions such as Parkinson's disease and other synucleinopathy.  Currently, there are major gaps in knowledge regarding the mechanism by which these mutant species may affect ?-SYN pathology and if ?-SYN aggregates in LBs contain mutant proteins produced by transcriptional mutagenesis. Our central hypothesis is that 8-oxodG-mediated transcriptional mutagenesis event leads to the generation of novel mutant variants of ?-SYN which causes nucleation-dependent aggregation and toxicity as seen in PD. The objective here is to identify oxidative stress-derived TM mutant species of ?-SYN and investigate their contribution to ?-SYN aggregation and the pathogenesis of PD.  The following three specific aims will be pursued: In Aim 1, levels of 8-oxodG and the entire profile of TM- derived mutant variants of ?-SYN mRNA in human postmortem brain samples of PD and control will be meas- ured. In Aim 2, the role of TM-generated ?-SYN mutants in nucleation-dependent aggregation process will be investigated and ?-SYN TM mutant proteins will be detected in human postmortem brain samples. In Aim 3, the collective effect of TM-generated mutants on ?-SYN aggregation, toxicity, and neuron-to-neuron transmission will be assessed.  Successful completion of the project will create a paradigm shift in our understanding of the molecular mech- anisms underlying oxidative stress-mediated ?-SYN pathology in PD. Knowledge of TM events in ?-SYN might be equally important to understand other molecules, such as A? and tau in other neurodegenerative conditions."
"9394006","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)    Classic galactosemia (CG) is a potentially lethal genetic disease that results from profound loss of galactose-1P uridylyltransferase (GALT); CG is the second most common metabolic disorder identified by newborn screening in the US. Despite neonatal diagnosis and lifelong dietary restriction of galactose, which is the current standard of care, a majority of affected children grow to experience a constellation of debilitating cognitive, behavioral, movement, female reproductive, and other disabilities. The mechanisms that underlie these long-term complications remain unknown, hindering prognosis and the development of more effective treatments. The goals of this project are to define the mechanism(s) of acute and long-term outcomes associated with GALT deficiency and leverage that knowledge in a preclinical setting to identify and test candidate pharmacological interventions for CG. To achieve these goals we will apply a combined model system plus human subjects approach. Specifically, we will conduct systems-level biochemical and genetic studies in a Drosophila melanogaster model of GALT deficiency that demonstrates both acute galactose sensitivity in development and also galactose-independent adult movement, female fertility, and learning- related behavioral phenotypes, with targeted follow-up studies using patient samples to ensure relevance. This strategy circumvents the otherwise crippling effect of limited patient numbers to enable the open-minded studies of mechanism needed to understand the bases of acute and long-term outcomes in CG. Our Specific Aims include: (1) define the metabolomic consequences of GALT deficiency in both Drosophila and humans, (2) identify genetic modifiers of acute and long-term outcomes in GALT deficient Drosophila and patients, and (3) test candidate pharmacological modifiers of outcome using a GALT-null Drosophila model of CG. The results of these studies will reveal what causes the acute and long-term sequelae of CG and will provide a first evidence-based step toward improved intervention."
"9393351","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The candidate requests support for a five year program of training and research to better understand how brain biochemistry and neural activity are altered in bipolar disorder.  In the proposed training program, the candidate will buid upon his previous experience in basic neuroscience research and clinical psychiatry to perform a multidisciplinary project at McLean Hospital and the Beth-Israel Deaconess Medical Center. His training plan includes: 1) training in the application of Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS) to in vivo studies of neurotransmitter activity and brain metabolism 2) training in the use of functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) to examine neural network activity 3) training in the design and execution of patient oriented investigation and 4) training in the responsible conduct of research.  A hallmark feature of bipolar disorder is that it is episodic in nature with what appear to be spontaneous transitions to pathological states and subsequent reversion to euthymia or transition to another state. There is little understood about the biology that gives rise to this instability in mood state or the processes that make these states transitory. This study proposes that the pathophysiology of bipolar disorder is characterized by: 1) original abnormal functional coupling between the brain regions involved in affective regulation, and 2) compensatory changes in neurotransmission. These alterations set in motion a series of forces that generate instability in brain function.  The candidate's research plan seeks to: 1) explore th relationship between brain network activity and mood state in bipolar disorder and 2) test a model of mood state switching that proposes a balance of excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission that can compensate for trait related alterations in brain network connectivity.  This study proposes to address this hypothesis by observing brain network activity as well as measuring neurotransmitters and markers of neuronal activity in vivo. These experiments will be performed in a single cohort of subjects with bipolar disorder longitudinally through clinical states of mania and euthymia. In doing so, this study seeks to minimize many substantial confounds of studying this disorder including disease heterogeneity, diagnostic instability, and medication effects.  The broader aim of this research is to understand the physiology of state switching in bipolar disorder. This disorder is a common and debilitating illness and current treatments are only partially effective. An understanding of the physiologic basis of transitions between states will allow the development of better interventions to prevent pathological switching to mania or depression."
"9425248","The broad and long term goal of this research project is to explore the roles of small conductance Ca2+- activated K (SK) channels in the mechanisms of ventricular arrhythmogenesis. We hypothesize that the SK current upregulation is an endogenous compensatory mechanism to protect the heart from arrhythmias related to reduced repolarization reserve, but under some conditions can result in excess repolarization reserve and proarrhythmic effects. The SK channel became a focus of our research after we discovered that the apamin- sensitive potassium current (IKAS, or SK current) is increased in both the rabbit and human ventricles with heart failure (HF). We also discovered that SK current is acutely increased in normal ventricles with hypokalemia, in a manner that depends on the ventricular activation sequence. These findings raise the intriguing possibility that SK current is a rescue current that compensates for the electrophysiological effects of increased intracellular Ca2+ load. While maintaining repolarization reserve in HF may be antiarrhythmic, we also found that excessive or heterogeneous shortening of the APD by SK current may be proarrhythmic. Our recent preliminary results indicate that IKAS is activated by isoproterenol, and that female rabbit ventricles express more SK current during early phase 2 than male ventricles. CyPPA activation of SK2 and SK3 causes ECG J point elevation, heterogeneous APD distribution, phase 2 reentry and spontaneous VF in normal rabbit ventricles. The latter finding suggests that SK current may also contribute to proarrhythmia in certain clinical conditions by creating excess repolarization reserve, such as in the J-wave syndromes. The incorporation of IKAS in computer models will generate important new insights into the dynamical effects of IKAS in ventricular repolarization. A combined mapping and computer simulation approach will be needed to fully understand the importance of IKAS in cardiac arrhythmogenesis, including both the proarrhythmic and antiarrhythmic potentials. We propose the following specific aims: Aim 1: Antiarrhythmic and proarrhythmic mechanisms of SK current in rabbit ventricles. The Aim 1A is designed to study the Purkinje cells (PCs) in both normal and failing rabbit ventricles to test the hypothesis that the SK current is increased in PCs and that blocking the SK current decreases the Ca2+-membrane potential coupling gain and promotes Ca2+ induced arrhythmias. The Aim 1B is designed to study SK current and J-wave syndrome. We hypothesize that (a) SK current is in part responsible for J-wave elevation and VF during hypothermia, and apamin reverses these proarrhythmic effects and (b) heterogeneous SK current activation can cause J wave elevation and spontaneous VF through heterogeneous shortening of APD and phase 2 reentry. Aim 2: Antiarrhythmic and proarrhythmic mechanisms of SK current in computer simulation. Aim 2A will systematically investigate the mechanisms of SK currents as a rescue mechanism preventing arrhythmias under QT prolongation and as a proarrhythmic mechanism under early repolarization. Aim 2B will extend and validate the hypotheses tested in the rabbits to human models."

In the past, inotropic drugs that enhance myocardial performance acutely were developed to treat HF, but most of them are now contraindicated because they worsen HF outcomes long-term. Recently, we developed a novel culturing method, termed Matrigel Mattress, which allowed the simultaneous assessment of contractile performance and calcium dynamics in individual human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs). Using the Matrigel Mattress method as a basis for a chemical screening platform, we discovered that the small molecule EGM significantly enhanced both inotropy and lusitropy in hiPSC-CMs and improved cardiac function in vivo. Unlike the traditional inotropes, EGM did not affect calcium (Ca) cycling, cellular cAMP concentrations or increase the beat rate, suggesting it acts by a fundamentally novel mechanism. To unlock the mechanistic underpinnings of EGM's pharmacology, we carried out a biochemical pull-down assay and identified farnesyl diphosphate synthase (FDPS), required for protein prenylation, as a candidate target of EGM. Consistent with prior studies demonstrating that FDPS contributes to hypertrophy and HF in animal models, we found that naturally occurring variants in the FDPS gene were highly associated with HF in Vanderbilt University Medical Center's electronic health record-linked DNA database. The latter result, based on real world clinical data, raises the exciting possibility that modulating the level of FDPS activity over a course of a person's life can significantly alter HF natural history; and that compounds like EGM that inhibit FDPS may improve long-term HF outcomes. Based on these findings, we hypothesize that EGM enhances myocardial performance by inhibiting FDPS, and that FDPS inhibition improves both acute cardiac function and long-term HF outcome. Here, we propose innovative chemical and functional genomic approaches to elucidate the role of FDPS in EGM function. In Aim 1, we will carry out a structure activity relationship (SAR) study of EGM analogs to determine whether FDPS inhibition is essential for EGM function. In Aim 2, we will employ the CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing to determine whether ablating the FDPS gene recapitulates EGM's unique pharmacology in hiPSC-CMs. In Aim 3, we will utilize the CRISPR/Cas9- directed homology directed repair (HDR) to introduce the nucleotide changes corresponding to the CHF- associated FDPS variants, and evaluate their impact on hiPSC-CM performance and FDPS function. The proposed study will delineate the effects of FDPS modulation on myocardial performance, and possibly identify additional targets of EGM. This study leverages the unique pharmacology of EGM to lay the foundation for a new understanding of myocardial regulation and the new therapeutic paradigm of ?dual purpose? drugs that acutely relieve HF symptoms as well as improve long-term HF outcomes."
"9429317","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The proven efficacy of BRAF and MEK inhibitors (BRAFi+MEKi) for the treatment of patients with BRAF mutant metastatic melanoma testifies to a strong degree of MAPK pathway addiction. Beyond the approximately 50% of metastatic melanoma with V600BRAF signature mutations, additional subsets such as the 20% with signature mutations in NRAS may also display variable degrees of MAPK pathway addiction. However, resistance to BRAFi+MEKi therapy is commonplace, severely limiting its curative potential. The mechanisms of intrinsic, adaptive and acquired resistance are inter-related and involve selection for genomic variants, tumor cell-intrinsic adaptations, as well as stromal and immune alterations. Based on specific mechanisms of resistance, clinical trials have built on the foundation of BRAFi+MEKi and are testing ternary combinations targeting additional molecules such as AKT, c-MET and CDK4/6. Addiction to the MAPK pathway in therapy-naïve melanoma can paradoxically become addiction to the MAPK pathway inhibitors (MAPKi) in therapy-resistant melanoma. We have demonstrated this for BRAF mutant melanoma (resistant to BRAFi+MEKi) and NRAS mutant melanoma (resistant to MEKi). The common basis of MAPKi addiction in resistant melanoma lies in ERK hyper-activation upon MAPKi withdrawal, regardless of the specific mechanism of resistance. Through our work in a panel of MAPKi-resistant cell lines, we have dissected the pathways downstream of ERK hyper-activation (induced by MAPKi withdrawal) that mediate either weak (a slow-cycling state) or strong (cell death) MAPKi addiction. In addition, we have identified i) a strategy to convert weak into strong addiction among chronically selected resistant populations (i.e., R-lines) and ii) a molecularly distinct R-line precursor sub-population that arises early during MAPKi treatment and displays strong MAPKi addiction. Importantly, identifying microscopic emergence of MAPKi-addicted, proliferative resistance enabled a more precise timing of drug holiday or intermittent dosing early during the treatment course to suppress resistance development. Here, we set out to test strategies to i) augment drug addiction in vivo using patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models of melanoma with acquired or late resistance to BRAFi+MEKi (BRAF mutant) or MEKi (NRAS mutant) and ii) select against microscopic resistance during the early course of MAPKi therapy in PDX models by signature-guided implementation of intermittent MAPKi dosing. This set of studies will also generate a ?renewable? tissue resource for translational melanoma work encompassing omically and clinically (in mice and men) annotated PDX models representing about 70% of metastatic cutaneous melanoma. In the era of targeted cancer therapeutics, exploiting the recently appreciated drug addiction phenotype as a common- denominator vulnerability of resistant tumors may serve to turn the inevitability of resistance against itself."
"9339878","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Low and middle income countries are experiencing a substantial increase in cancer incidence, with India very much in the epicenter of this explosive growth. A large percentage of cancers are detected at a late stage in India, and active engagement of primary care providers can have a significant impact on cancer outcomes. There is low level of awareness of cancer risk factors, symptoms, and appropriate use of screening approaches for early detection of cancers among primary care providers. Mobile health based oncology education can serve as a powerful tool for offering e-learning opportunities to physicians, as mobile technology is widely available and inexpensive, and it can provide training on demand. We propose to develop a mobile application (M-OncoED) to educate physicians on cancer risk factors, symptoms, and screening approaches. The specific aims are the following: Aim 1: Develop a mobile health intervention package (M-OncoED) to educate primary care physicians on cancer risk factors, patient symptoms, screening approaches, and benefits of early detection. Aim 2: Test the feasibility and acceptability of M-OncoED in increasing physician knowledge of cancer screening and early detection and compare physician preferences for structured versus unstructured education modules. Aim 3: Perform preliminary assessment of whether M-OncoED changes physician behavior as measured by increased rate of recommendations for screening and diagnostic testing. We have assembled a multidisciplinary team of researchers with expertise in mobile technology development, evaluation research, and oncology training. RTI international will collaborate with the World Health Organization and Indian partners, including Studio Medica, Snehita Women's Health Foundation, Sree Gokulam Medical College, Government of Kerala, and the Indian Medical Association to implement the intervention. Successful completion of the study aims will provide the evidence base for using mobile applications to train providers to improve oncology care. This study will also lay the foundations to design and conduct large scale studies to further refine the mobile application and systematically assess the impact of the training tool in changing physician behavior to reduce the burden from cancer. Furthermore, the M- OncoED application will serve as a platform for expanding features to provide training to a wider group of providers, including nurses and community health workers. The framework provided in this grant application can be used to tailor the mobile application as required to be successfully deployed in other settings."

Our expertise in bioinformatics  began with the genomics program, particularly gene expression microarray analysis. The growing need for  analysis, large data set management and storage, and integration with clinical and population characteristics  necessitated a Lineberger-wide approach. This resulted in the creation of the UNC Lineberger Bioinformatics  Shared Resource and its successful review five years ago. The continued explosion of genomics, proteomic  and other clinical and population data in cancer research spurred an ever greater emphasis on integration of  laboratory and clinical systems to facilitate high impact translational research. Fulfillment of this need required  a growing UNC Lineberger investment in computational infrastructure, software, personnel, and systems  developments. BIONF leveraged this investment toward a common infrastructure that now supports many  other Lineberger Shared Resources, research programs, and individual labs. This development included a  common computational infrastructure (i.e. Lineberger Data Warehouse) to integrate multiple distinct data  sources, scalable software and system development, and increased analytic capacity. As data storage and  analytical needs grow, the BIONF has identified specific areas of growth and development for the next 5 years  for the LCCC members to continue to perform as a national and international leader in basic biology,  computational genomics, translational, population and clinical research. Substantial high impact research  highlights resulted from this shared resource. The most easily identified were the multi-level analysis for TCGA  publications but this Shared Resource touched virtually every Center program and research effort with data  intensive needs."
"9356328","PROJECT SUMMARY ABSTRACT  The pathologic determinants of in vivo cortical atrophy in neurodegenerative disease are not well understood due in part to the lack of magnetic resonance (MR) imaging close to death. Resolving this relationship is necessary for addressing the utility of quantitative brain imaging as an in vivo marker for disease severity and progression. Primary progressive aphasia (PPA) is a clinical language dementia syndrome that provides an ideal model for exploring the relationship between cortical atrophy and underlying pathology because it is associated with a signature pattern of asymmetric atrophy concentrated in the left hemisphere language network. This relatively focal pattern of peak atrophy allows for within-subject comparisons between damaged and relatively spared regions (e.g., left vs. right hemisphere; language vs. memory-related regions).  PPA can be caused by either Alzheimer disease (AD) pathology or frontotemporal lobar degeneration pathology with a left-hemisphere dominant distribution. Amyloid-ß plaques (APs) and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) are the hallmark pathologic features of AD that are known to coincide with neuronal and synaptic loss and accumulation of activated microglia. The relationships among these markers have not been characterized in PPA with AD pathology (PPA-AD), but will be examined in this project. Specifically, Aim 1 will determine the extent and severity of cortical atrophy in five language and two non-language regions (subserving memory and visual sensation) of PPA-AD participants who had structural MR scans within 2.5 years of death. Aim 2 will quantify NFT, AP, activated microglia, neuron, and synapse densities in bilateral whole-hemisphere sections in the same regions and PPA-AD participants investigated in Aim 1 to determine the relationships among histologic markers, and their associations to in vivo measures of cortical atrophy. Our preliminary findings are consistent with our hypotheses and show that PPA-AD displays a leftward asymmetry of cortical atrophy in temporal and parietal language regions that corresponds to the highest densities of NFTs and lower densities of neurons. Combined results from this project will identify relationships among neurodegenerative features in order to discern the histopathologic basis of cortical degeneration underlying cognitive decline in PPA-AD."
"9405619","Heart failure with impaired systolic function (HF) is a common malady of the aging population, with dire personal and socioeconomic consequences. The past 2 decades have seen little progress in the development of new pharmaceutical agents to treat HF. A major factor contributing to the progression of HF and adverse outcomes is exaggerated sympathetic nervous system activity. Current pharmacological treatments for HF target the peripheral effects of this augmented sympathetic nerve activity, but not the central nervous system source. Recent studies in my laboratory have implicated the extracellular signal- regulated kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway as an obligatory step leading to sympathetic excitation by many of the neurochemicals (i.e., angiotensin II, aldosterone, pro-inflammatory cytokines) that are known to be upregulated in key cardiovascular regulatory regions of the HF brain ? effectively acting as a final common pathway for these excitatory agonists. Working with a rat model of ischemia-induced HF that closely mimics systolic HF in humans, we found that reducing brain ERK1/2 activity in these regions ? and in particular in the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus which is a source of presympathetic neurons ? reduces sympathetic nerve activity and ameliorates the peripheral manifestations of HF. In addition, our preliminary studies suggest that this molecular pathway is amenable to treatment with peripherally administered drug-loaded microparticle preparations. The present proposal will address both basic mechanistic and potential therapeutic aspects of this molecular pathway. The mechanistic studies will focus specifically on the role of ERK1/2 signaling in the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus, a locus of presympathetic neurons known to contribute to augmented sympathetic nerve activity in HF. We will examine the role of the epidermal growth factor receptor as a putative ?gateway? to the ERK1/2 signaling pathway by multiple excitatory agonists, the effect of ERK1/2 signaling on transcription factors that upregulate the expression of excitatory agonists, the effect of ERK1/2 signaling on a potassium channel mechanisms that may increase the excitability of presympathetic neurons. The therapeutic studies will explore the possibility that an advanced drug delivery system that facilitates passage of drug across the blood brain barrier can reduce brain ERK1/2 signaling and thereby reduce sympathetic nerve activity to improve peripheral manifestations of HF and survival in HF - a critical translational issue. We anticipate that these studies will lead to better understanding of the role of brain ERK1/2 signaling in sympathetic excitation and will lay the groundwork for the development of novel pharmacological approaches to the treatment of HF."

"9388306","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): West Nile virus (WNV) is a model flavivirus and an NIAID Category B infectious/emerging agent. It is currently the leading cause of viral encephalitis in the United States and an ongoing public health threat globally. WNV can cause severe and fatal neurological diseases. There are no vaccines or antiviral therapeutics to prevent or treat WNV infection. Therefore, there is an imminent need to understand the immunological processes by which the virus is controlled in order to facilitate therapeutic strategies against infection. IRF5 is a key transcription factor for the induction of immune-modulating cytokines. Our recent studies indicate that virus signaling of IRF5 activation and the induction and function of IRF5-target genes in dendritic cells (DCs) are essential components of antiviral immunity. However, a major void exists in the understanding of IRF5 activation and function, as signaling pathways and mechanisms of IRF5 activation, IRF5 transcriptional targets, and overall function of IRF5 in programming DC effector actions are not known. Studies in this proposal focus on defining the regulation and functions of IRF5 in DCs for the control of WNV infection. This proposal aims to test the hypothesis that IRF5 is essential for type I interferon and cytokine production in DCs for the effective control of WNV infection. Specifically, we will (1) define the signaling pathways and mechanisms of activation of IRF5, and (2) characterize the IRF5 target genes for antiviral actions. Together, these studies will advance our knowledge in IRF5 activation upon virus sensing in the host, and the effector function of IRF5 target genes in programming effective immune response against virus infection. Insights can lead to development of therapeutic and preventative action against flavivirus disease."
"9605598","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): During aging, skeletal muscles become atrophic and lose contractile force. This affects a large population of elderly regardless of ethnicity, gender, and wealth and is the most common cause of age-related loss of independence, frailty, and mortality. As the elderly proportion in the population continues to increase, the potential social and economic burden of muscle aging is becoming enormous. The neuromuscular junction is a synapse between motor neuron terminals and skeletal muscle fibers that transmit signals from motor neurons to muscle fibers. The neuromuscular transmission is critical for the control of muscle contraction and is thus essential for our physical mobility and daily life. Extensive research has revealed insight into the pathophysiological mechanisms of muscle aging. However, although NMJ structures and functions are disrupted in aged animals, little is known about underlying mechanisms. In contrast to NMJ formation, which has been studied extensively, much less is understood about mechanisms of NMJ maintenance, in particular in aged animals. This proposal will test an innovative hypothesis that NMJ function in aged animals depends on agrin signaling, a pathway that is required for NMJ formation. In particular, we will address the following critical questions by using a combination of cutting edge technologies. First, does LRP4 deficiency mimicking LRP4 reduction in aged mice cause NMJ decline? Does restoring agrin signaling improve NMJ function in aged mice? What is the mechanism that controls LRP4 stability? How does agrin signaling maintain NMJ function in aged mice? Results will provide unequivocal evidence to either support or refute that agrin signaling is involved in NMJ decline during aging, reveal whether enhancing agrin signaling may prevent or delay NMJ decline and muscle aging, and identify novel mechanisms controlling LRP4 stability and mediating agrin signaling to promote NMJ maintenance. Such knowledge may contribute to a better understanding of molecular mechanisms of NMJ decline and muscle aging, which is prerequisite to the development of effective therapeutic interventions for NMJ decline and muscle aging."
"9389525","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Many of the risk factors for heart disease are behavioral, such as physical inactivity, smoking, and diets high in saturated and trans-fats. Cardiac rehabilitation and other secondary prevention programs are effective at helping cardiac patients make the initial lifestyle changes needed to reduce their risks, but patients often fail t maintain those changes after the program ends. In this grant, the investigators propose to develop a novel mHealth application for supporting maintenance of physical activity after cardiac rehabilitation. By taking advantage of the frequent interactions that individuals have with their mobile phones throughout the day, the investigators will design and evaluate an adaptive, personalized application that (1) keeps patients reminded of their health goals, increasing the likelihood that they will notice opportunities to engage in physical activity; (2) provides actionable ideas for how patients can be active right now, given their current context; and (3) helps patients plan and reflect on their physical activity to enable creation of robust and sustainable physical-activity habits. In addition, the application will adapt its functioning for ech patient over time in order to minimize user burden while optimizing its ability to encourage physical activity and maintain engagement with the intervention. A user-centered design process will be used to investigate design requirements of mHealth technologies for long-term use, and the system will be evaluated in a year-long study with 60 patients with coronary artery disease who completed phase II cardiac rehabilitation. Study data will be analyzed to understand how the use of different components affect, over time, patients' physical activity levels, perceived burden, and engagement with the system. The project's innovations lie in grounding the proposed intervention in dual-process models of self-regulation, developing new algorithms to enable adaptation and personalization of how the application works over time, and using a micro-randomization study design to enable causal accounts of how the application use affects patients' physical activity, user burden, and engagement over the course of a year. The success of the project will provide cardiac patients with continuously available support for staying physically active in the midst of daily life, and deep understanding of technical and design requirements for behavior-change mHealth technologies for long-term use."
"9396232","PROPOSAL SUMMARY Epidermal differentiation is critical for health with differentiation defects underlying skin diseases in children, including the common Atopic Dermatitis. Epidermal differentiation is a complex process in which enhancers, epigenetic changes, and transcription factors coordinately regulate the expression of structural proteins, adhesion molecules, and lipid producing enzymes necessary for epidermal barrier formation. Dramatic gene expression changes observed in differentiation correspond to large-scale reorganization of epigenetic regulator structures such as super-enhancers, which preferentially drive expression of genes vital for cell identity. In recent experiments, we have studied the dynamics of enhancer formation during differentiation of human keratinocytes. Within the super-enhancer encompassing the gene body of Grhl3, a key regulator of epidermal differentiation, we identified enriched binding sites for IRX, a transcription factor with unknown roles in the epidermis, suggesting that IRX may promote epidermal differentiation. Consistent with this idea, we found that the temporal expression of several IRX factors in mouse epidermal development mirrors that of known regulatory transcription factors for epidermal differentiation, including GRHL3. Depletion of GRHL3 in keratinocytes changes the enhancer landscape with formation of new non-keratinocyte super-enhancers that promote neuronal cell fate. Intriguingly, these newly formed enhancers exhibit striking overrepresentation of IRX binding sites, suggesting that GRHL3 may suppress the tendency of keratinocytes to exhibit neuronal-type features. The temporal expression pattern of several Irx genes in mouse epidermal development is similar to that of well-known epidermal differentiation. Single cell analysis of newborn mice epidermis unveiled a gradient of Irx3 expression that correlates with the keratinocyte's degree of differentiation. These preliminary results suggest that IRX plays a key role in epidermal differentiation. The hypothesis is that an interplay between GRHL3 and IRX promotes epidermal differentiation through at least two different mechanisms: 1) both IRX and GRHL3 activate genes expressing epidermal differentiation factors, and 2) GRHL3 suppresses the formation of IRX-sensitive SEs that otherwise would activate non-epidermal, neuronal genes in the differentiating epidermis. Two Aims are proposed to test the hypothesis: Aim 1 will utilize an in vitro model of human epidermal keratinocyte differentiation to provide insights into the mechanism whereby IRX regulates differentiation. Aim 2 will utilize conditional Irx3;Irx5 double knockout mice to characterize the epidermal differentiation phenotype of mice deficient for Irx3 and Irx5 in the epidermis. This work will establish the role of IRX in skin development and elucidate how GRHL3 and IRX collaborate in epidermal differentiation."
"9604713","What are the cellular and network cortical mechanisms of optimal neural and behavioral performance? Through what mechanisms do spontaneous and evoked changes in the waking state of the cortex influence sensory processing and behavior? The goal of my laboratory is to answer these broad and important questions at levels extending from cellular and synaptic properties, to local circuits, to thalamocortical networks, modulation, and behavior. Answering these questions are fundamental not only to understanding the normal operation of the brain, but also its operation in a variety of disorders, from schizophrenia, to ADHD, autism, and others. Our proposal is ambitious, but not unreasonable or unfocused. We have already made significant progress towards a broad outline of important pieces of the puzzle, and therefore are confident that we will make very significant progress towards a detailed clarification of these two fundamental questions during the funding period.  More than a hundred years ago, two investigators, Yerkes and Dodson, noted that optimal performance on difficult detection tasks was related to arousal level in an ?inverted-U? shaped fashion. Increases from low arousal to intermediate arousal would enhance performance on difficult tasks, while further increases in arousal from intermediate to high would decrease performance. This result suggests that there is an ?optimal state? for both the brain and behavior. Surprisingly, until our recent study in behaving mice performing a difficult auditory detection task, the cortical activity or circuit representation of optimal state had not been investigated. Our investigation revealed that the optimal state for performance of a difficult auditory sensory detection task occurred at intermediate levels of arousal and was associated with the suppression of slow corticocortical and thalamocortical activity, a hyperpolarized and low variability of pyramidal cell membrane potential, and large amplitude and highly reliable evoked auditory cortical synaptic responses. In an indication of the broad nature of these effects, we observed that we could predict more than half of the variance in cortical neuronal membrane potential, action potential, and even behavioral performance simply by measuring the pupil diameter ? an easily obtained measure of rapid (second to second) fluctuations in behavioral state. By explaining a large fraction of neuronal and behavioral variance, we have demonstrated that the brain is much more precise and reliable than previously thought. Here we propose to reveal the detailed cellular, modulatory, and network mechanisms that account for these prominent effects of state variation on neural and behavioral performance. Through a combination of state-of-the-art imaging, whole cell recording, optogenetic manipulation, and high quality behavioral monitoring, we will be able to detail the contribution of multiple neuronal and neuromodulatory pathways to the determination of optimal state for neural/behavioral responses."
"9393236","OVERVIEW ABSTRACT Dr. George Koob, the Director of the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, recently called for programs that identify and promote effective preventive interventions tailored to Native people. The Native Center for Alcohol Research and Education (NCARE) at Washington State University, with our partners at the University of Colorado Denver and the University of Washington, offers coordinated efforts to mitigate and ultimately eliminate the alcohol-related devastation experienced by American Indian and Alaska Native (AI/AN) peoples through theory-based application of strategic and sustainable interventions. Achieving this goal will reduce the profound alcohol-related health disparities experienced by this underserved population. Our research agenda articulates a practical model of Native health that is grounded in theory and the daily lives of Native people. Our Research Projects and Pilot Projects will reach Native infants, youth, and adults in urban, rural, and frontier communities. Although our perspective is broad, our pragmatic grounding in the social, economic, and healthcare systems experienced by Native communities will be understandable and relevant to many audiences, including tribal communities, researchers, and clinicians. This grounding also increases the likelihood that our findings will translate into public health benefits. Our efforts will foreground prevention and intervention while contributing empirical evidence to the national conversation on healthcare costs. Collectively, this work has the potential to improve the quality of life for AI/AN with alcohol use disorders, as well as for their families and communities. NCARE proposes these activities: 1) Research Project 1: Compare the effectiveness a culturally adapted intervention against usual care for reducing risky drinking and increasing contraception use to prevent alcohol-exposed pregnancy and fetal alcohol spectrum disorders among Cheyenne River Sioux women in South Dakota; 2) Research Project 2: Compare the effectiveness of a talking circle intervention against usual care for reducing harmful behaviors and improving quality of life and healthcare use in urban Native clinic patients with alcohol problems in Seattle, Washington; and 3) Research Project 3: Test the effectiveness of motivational interviewing plus patient navigation for increasing enrollment in alcohol treatment programs and preventing re- admission to detoxification treatment for patients discharged from the Fairbanks Native Association detoxification unit in Fairbanks, Alaska. For all 3 Projects, we will conduct an economic evaluation of the interventions. These 3 Research Projects will be supported by the Administrative, Information Dissemination, Research Methods, and Pilot Project Cores. Notably, our research team includes 11 Native professionals participating in diverse roles, including Co-Leaders on all Cores and Research Projects. This unique connection between our investigators and our study population imbues our work with a special dynamic, supporting efforts to move Native alcohol research beyond a current, largely descriptive state into meaningful action."
"9413201","This proposal focuses on examining the mechanism of cannabidiol (CBD), a non-psychoactive component of cannabis with documented anti-seizure effects in several pre-clinical studies(1, 2) and a recent double-blinded, multicenter phase III clinical trial in patients with treatment-resistant epilepsy(3, 4). Despite centuries of clinical usage, the mechanism of action of CBD remains ambiguous. Further exploring the pharmacology of CBD may provide benefit to the 1/3 of epilepsy patients with seizures resistant to current treatments (10).  In one leading hypothesis, CBD acts as a competitive antagonist at the G-protein coupled receptor, GPR55, inhibiting binding of a membrane phospholipid, lysophosphatidylinositol (LPI). CBD blocks LPI- mediated increases in presynaptic Ca2+ and vesicular release, thus reducing excitability at axon terminals (12). However, the function of LPI-GPR55 signaling at inhibitory synapses, as well as potential postsynaptic effects, remains to be explored.  Using a multidisciplinary approach with ex vivo whole cell patch clamp electrophysiology, and in vitro immunocytochemistry and molecular biology, I discovered that LPI had unique effects at excitatory and inhibitory synapses, both at the pre- and postsynapse. At 5-10 minutes post application, LPI increased the frequency of vesicular release in CA1 hippocampus, consistent with previous reports of presynaptic locus of GPR55 action(12). However, contrary to prior studies, I identified prominent GPR55 staining in the cell bodies of CA1 pyramidal neurons, and a postsynaptic LPI effect of increased GluA1 AMPAR expression at 50-60 minutes post application. I also determined that LPI reduced inhibitory postsynaptic strength, in part by reducing GABAAR ?2 subunit expression. Taken together, these results suggest that LPI increases the excitatory / inhibitory ratio in hippocampal neuronal networks by a dual mechanism: enhancing excitatory transmission and attenuating inhibition. This predicts that CBD, by opposing LPI action, may exert its beneficial anti-seizure effects on both excitatory and inhibitory synapses through actions at GPR55. I plan to explore these possibilities by repeating these experiments with CBD pre-treatment and GPR55-/- mice as controls.  To supplement these experiments at the circuit level, I plan to investigate how LPI and CBD regulate evoked transmission and short-term plasticity in CA3-CA1 hippocampal circuits. At the in vivo level, I will use both acute and chronic seizure models to determine seizure susceptibility in GPR55-/- mice. Based on surprising preliminary results, I discovered that seizure activity upregulates GPR55 membrane expression, producing a biomarker for prolonged seizures and potentiating the effects of LPI. In all, as part of this fellowship, I propose to combine my clinical training and scientific experience to elucidate the mechanisms of this intriguing therapeutic target for epilepsy, and help stratify subpopulations for targeted treatment."
"9334847","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term goal of this project is to establish a set of powerful technologies that enable special and temporal control of the epigenome. We hypothesize that, by selectively and biochemically perturbing a single protein (or even single domain within a protein), we can control the epigenome with high precision. Thus, this project aims to utilize state-of-the-art protein engineering technologies to generate high-performance binding proteins to epigenetic regulatory proteins that can be genetically encoded for intracellular use. We will utilize the designer binding protein platform, termed monobody that we have pioneered and refined over the last decade. Monobodies are designer binding proteins built using the fibronectin type III (FN3) scaffold. Unlike conventional antibodies and their fragments, FN3 lacks disulfide bonds and thus monobodies fold into their functional form under reducing conditions, such as the nucleus and cytoplasm within cells. Therefore, the monobodies are particularly suited as genetically encoded, intracellular inhibitors against epigenetic regulatory proteins.  By utilizing sophisticated technologies that we have developed over the last decade, we will generate monobodies to many epigenetic regulatory proteins that have high affinity and exquisite specificity. We will develop companion technologies that enable novel applications of monobodies toward understanding and controlling epigenetic regulatory processes. Specifically, we propose the following aims: Aim 1.  To develop high-specificity, high-affinity monobodies to readers and writers of chromatin modifications. Aim 2. To develop technologies for using monobodies as genetically encoded inhibitors directed to epigenetic regulatory proteins and validate monobodies from Aim 1 for intracellular use. Aim 3. To develop chemoepigenetic technologies for temporal control of the chromatin regulators in developing cells using monobody inhibitors, in particular CHD7 in the context of neural crest differentiation and the CHARGE syndrome. We will make these powerful tools available to the community.  We have assembled a team of experts with complementary skills and this project will leverage resources and expertise available through a network of collaborators. We have a strong track record of innovations and enabling the research community. Technologies and knowledge gained in this project will provide the epigenomics research community with novel and powerful tools and lead to new approaches to controlling the epigenome for positively impacting human health. Together, this project is perfectly aligned with the vision of the RFA."

Previously, our laboratory discovered abnormal neuronal calcium signaling in PCs, which play an important role in the pathogenesis of SCAs. Previous studies also suggest that neuronal activity of PCs is abnormal in ataxic mouse models. We demonstrated that positive allosteric modulators (PAMs) of small conductance calcium-activated potassium (SK) channels can normalize the abnormal firing pattern of PCs in SCA2 mice and alleviate behavioral and neuropathological phenotypes. These results suggest that SK PAMs can be potentially useful as therapeutic agents for the treatment of SCA2 and possibly for other ataxias. This project brings together the complementary skills and expertise of two laboratories for the discovery of such agents. To achieve this goal, we will focus on the following specific aims: R21 Phase Aim 1. To identify novel subtype-selective SK PAM candidates. We will determine the crystal structure of SK2 channels in complex with the prototype subtype-selective PAMs. We will obtain structural information that will be used to perform virtual high throughput screening for subtype-selective SK PAMs. R21 Phase Aim 2. To validate functional activity of novel SK PAMs. We will use fluorescence-based high throughput assay and electrophysiological methods to test SK PAM candidates. R33 Phase Aim 3. To investigate the specificity of novel SK PAMs for SK channels. We will evaluate the specificity of the SK PAM candidates for SK channels over other K+, Na+ and Ca2+ channels using electrophysiological recordings. R33 Phase Aim 4. To investigate the effects of novel SK PAMs on the activity of cerebellar PCs in SCA2 mice. We will perform ex vivo cerebellar slice electrophysiological recordings of PC activity in these studies. The resulting subtype-selective SK PAMs will provide critical leads for future preclinical and clinical development, fulfilling the critical and unmet needs in ataxia patients. These molecules will also offer novel and unique research tools for understanding the biological function of SK channels in health and disease. Thus, the proposed project will have significant impact in basic and translational neuroscience."
"9449771","PROJECT SUMMARY The investigators will combine experimental studies with computational simulations to uncover the neural circuit mechanisms underlying taste choice behavior. A fundamental question to be addressed is how the neural activity induced by a given taste is impacted by the recent sampling of another taste and/or by the expectation that another taste is forthcoming. We will analyse data produced from ensemble recordings of neural activity and make use of optogenetic techniques that alter neural activity, to further our work on how specific features of such activity impact behavior during a decision making task. These data will provide fuel to our modeling efforts, with which we will produce a framework that can generalize to other sensory modalities, whenever decisions are based on a consideration of one stimulus at a time (even if two stimuli are present) rather than on a parallel processing of two or more stimuli simultaneously?that is, this novel framework will allow us to understand the behavior of animals when faced with a choice between any two separate stimuli. Thus, a transformative aspect of the research will be the development of a new framework for the analysis of decision-making when the choice to be made is whether to stick with the current stimulus or to switch to another. In such decision making tasks, which are ubiquitous in natural settings, the stimulus itself is chosen by the subject rather than being controled by the experimenter. Our recordings of the animal's behavior simultaneously with its neural activity allow us to tightly constrain these first dynamic models of such a process. Taste is an important, albeit underused, modality for addressing issues of sensory processing, in that it has a strong connection to behavior?indeed it is well-nigh impossible for an animal to sample a taste without a behavioral response. Moreover, given that tastants can be intrinisically hedonic or aversive, animals are internally driven to make responses and will do so without the months of training?which inevitably rewires the brain?required for animal training in behavioral tasks based on other sensory modalities. Therefore taste is ideally suited to the study of naturalistic decision making."
"9395935","Summary Cardiovascular disease (CVD) represents the major cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with diabetes. Despite aggressive management of levels of lipids and glucose, both types 1 and 2 diabetic patients exhibit earlier onset and more extensive atherosclerotic lesions than non-diabetic subjects, and the response to lipid- lowering strategies is significantly less robust than the beneficial effects noted in non-diabetic subjects. Preclinical studies in diabetic animals have shown accelerated progression and impaired regression of atherosclerotic plaques, as well as increased retention of macrophages (MØs) in plaques. We will focus on diabetes-driven mechanisms linked to impaired atherosclerosis regression and the specific role of MØ perturbation. Our proposed studies are built on the discovery that transplantation of aortic arches from Ldlr-/- mice into diabetic mice deficient in RAGE or its cytoplasmic domain binding partner, DIAPH1, required for RAGE signaling, display significantly improved plaque regression, independent of changes in plasma glucose or lipid levels, compared to wild-type diabetic mice. Our earlier studies demonstrated that activation of RAGE is a critical component of the vessel wall response to hyperglycemia and that RAGE-driven mechanisms accounted for the observed acceleration and progression of atherosclerosis. In this application, using models of hyperglycemia and insulin resistance (IR), we will test the hypothesis that the consequences of hyperglycemia and RAGE/DIAPH1-dependent mechanisms in MØs modulate MØ trafficking (recruitment & retentions/stasis), MØ inflammatory polarization and MØ metabolism and oxidative stress, mechanisms which converge to suppress regression of established atherosclerotic plaques in diabetes. We will test novel pharmacological antagonists of RAGE/DIAPH1 in our murine model of diabetic atherosclerosis regression. These studies will provide novel insights into diabetes specific mechanisms that promote MØ accumulation and impair regression, and foster the development of novel therapeutic adjuncts for diabetic atherosclerosis."
"9392125","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are among the most common bacterial infections in the world and result in more than $1.5 billion USD in associated medical costs. The most common cause of UTIs is uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC). UPEC use the chaperone/usher (CU) pathway to assemble and secrete pili onto their cell surfaces. These pili are virulence-associated structures that project away from the cell surface in a hairlike fashion and mediate adhesion to the urinary tract. The chaperone and usher proteins of the CU pathway work in unison to construct these pili. The chaperone, a periplasmic protein, facilitates subunit folding, prevents premature subunit-subunit interactions, and targets subunits to the outer membrane usher protein. The usher is a multifunctional pilus assembly and secretion platform, catalyzing the exchange of chaperone-subunit for subunit-subunit interactions to assemble the pilus fiber and providing the channel for secretion of the fiber to th cell surface. The usher is a large protein consisting of a periplasmic N-terminal domain (N), a transmembrane beta-barrel domain that is gated by an internal Plug domain, and two periplasmic C-terminal domains (C1 and C2). These domains act together to facilitate the ordered assembly and secretion of the pilus. The overall goal of this proposal is to structurally and mechanistically characterize the usher's role in pilus biogenesis. This proposal will test the hypothesis that the usher is both a gated secretion channel and catalytic nanomachine, and that its catalytic activity is due to a carefully coordinated sequence of usher-chaperone-subunit interactions and the accurate placement of chaperone-subunit complexes relative to one another. I propose to use fluorescence techniques to understand how the usher transfers pilus subunits from its N domain to its C domains, a necessary step to clear the N domain for incorporation of the next pilus subunit. I will use similar techniques to understand the Plug's interaction with the C domains of the inactivated usher and how and when the Plug domain is removed from the usher channel upon usher activation. Finally, I propose to probe the structural basis for usher-catalyzed pilus assembly and secretion. I will use molecular techniques to generate pilus assembly intermediates suitable for analysis by cryo-electron microscopy and X-ray crystallography. The information gained by the experiments described in this proposal will lead to new advances in the field of protein secretion. The results will aid in the identification f physical and mechanistic targets for novel therapeutics against UPEC, a particularly important endeavor in the current era of rampant antibiotic resistance."

"9470790","Project Summary/Abstract Migraine is a pervasive neurological disorder affecting 12-15% of the general populace in the U.S. and is highly invasive, if not debilitating, to sufferers of attacks. The neurophysiology that underlies migraine, though, is poorly understood. Premonitory symptoms and altered cortical evoked responses in migraineurs between attacks suggests persistent changes in brain network function that somehow give rise to migraine. The precedent aura that heralds the attack in up to one-third of migraineurs corresponds with cortical spreading depression (CSD), a wave of neural and glial depolarization within the cortex. Our understanding of CSD initiation rests on dysfunctional regulation of extracellular K+ and the excitatory neurotransmitter, glutamate. The purpose of this proposal is to elucidate mechanism of altered brain network function in migraine by studying a genetic form of the disorder, Familial Hemiplegic Migraine, type 2 (FHM2). FHM2 is a mutation of a sodium-potassium ATPase found in astrocytes in adults that drives clearance of glutamate following neural release. This clearance of glutamate is required to maintain the fidelity and staccato nature of neuron-to-neuron communication. The first aim of this proposal is to determine whether this decrease in glutamate clearance significantly alters the time course of neural glutamate signaling. The approach uses state of the art in vivo imaging of glutamate in real time as a living mouse carrying the FHM2 mutation is given a sensory stimulus. Results from this aim will show whether basic neural signaling is altered in the genetic form of migraine. The second aim of this proposal is to determine the effects of slowed glutamate clearance on synaptic activity and neural processing. Increasing the duration of glutamate in the extracellular space following neural release increases the ability of glutamate to act on post-synaptic receptors and the probability of recruiting neural responses. Simultaneous optical and electrical recordings of glutamate and neural activity will determine the effect of slowed glutamate clearance on neural processing. The results of this study will provide mechanistic evidence of persistent changes in brain network processing in migraine, shedding light on the pathophysiology that gives rise to migraine events."
"9426636","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The number of Americans at risk for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is increasing due to the growing obesity epidemic and its association with fatty liver disease, steatohepatitis, and cirrhosis. No medications have been shown to prevent HCC in high-risk patients with chronic liver disease. The long-term goal is to define mechanisms of hepatocarcinogenesis, providing a foundation for improved preventives, diagnostic tools, and treatments for HCC. The overall objective of this proposal is to identify cellular and molecular mechanisms by which serotonin promotes and antidepressants inhibit liver growth and tumor formation. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that 1) serotonin promotes liver growth and tumorigenesis by stimulating the serotonin receptor HTR2A on hepatocytes; and 2) serotonergic antidepressants inhibit liver growth and tumorigenesis by antagonism of HTR2A. The following specific aims are proposed to test this hypothesis: 1) Determine the cellular and molecular role of HTR2A in promoting liver tumor cell viability and liver growth; 2) Determine if amitriptyline suppresses liver growth and tumor formation via HTR2A; 3) Identify downstream genes that mediate amitriptyline?s effects on ?-catenin-driven liver growth and tumorigenesis and determine whether amitriptyline?s effects required activated ?-catenin. In Aim 1, the hypothesis that HTR2A mediates serotonin?s growth-promoting effects on HCC cells will be tested by measuring the effect of HTR2A knockdown on serotonin responsiveness of human liver cancer cell lines. In parallel, HTR2A orthologs will be knocked down in a zebrafish HCC model to determine the receptor and cell type(s) that mediate serotonin?s growth-promoting effects on hepatocytes in vivo. In Aim 2, the hypothesis that amitriptyline suppresses liver growth and tumor formation via inhibition of HTR2A will be tested using complementary approaches in human liver cancer cell lines and zebrafish as in Aim 1. In Aim 3, a prioritized list of genes, downregulated by amitriptyline treatment in mouse HCC, will be characterized for effects on liver growth and tumorigenesis and response to amitriptyline using zebrafish and mouse HCC models. The hypothesis that amitriptyline?s actions require activated ?-catenin will be tested. We expect the proposed studies to define how serotonin signaling and serotonergic antidepressants modulate liver growth and tumorigenesis. This research is significant because it will form the basis for identifying drugs to prevent liver cancer in high-risk patients, which could save thousands of lives each year."
"9433042","Project Summary  Herpesviruses are major causes of human infectious diseases. Sexually transmitted herpes simplex virus 2 (HSV-2) afflicts more than 400 million people world-wide, increases acquisition and transmission of HIV, and can be lethal when babies are infected during birth. HSV-1 is the leading cause of infectious blindness and is increasingly spread by sexual contact. Current anti-herpesviral therapies based on nucleos(t)ide analogs such as acyclovir (ACV) are inadequately suppressive in some patients. Nucleoside analogs also readily select for resistance mutations, which are difficult to treat with current second line drugs such as foscarnet due to toxicity. Therefore more effective therapeutic options and/or drugs with a different mechanism of action are urgently needed for use in salvage and combination therapies.  Herpesvirus replication relies on several activities catalyzed by nucleotidyl transferase superfamily (NTS) enzymes. We have strong preliminary data that several compounds known to inhibit NTS enzymes profoundly suppress HSV replication in cell culture, some further than ACV even without optimization. Our data also indicate the NTS enzyme inhibitors in the polyoxygenated heterocycle (POH) compound class, including N-hydroxypyridinones (HPOs) and N-hydroxynapthyridinones (HNOs), have a different mechanism of action than ACV and have a higher barrier to development of resistance. Specifically, the viral terminase has been identified as a viral target. Together, our observations suggest NTS inhibitors have strong potential for development into antiviral drugs. We propose to derive preliminary structure-activity relationships (SARs) for the HPOs and HNOs and identify their mechanism(s) of action. This will provide essential information to guide future medicinal chemistry optimization. We will also test the hypothesis that these POH compounds can be useful in combination therapy with the established anti-HSV drugs ACV and foscarnet. These goals will be pursued in two Aims: Aim 1: Test HPO and HNO compounds against HSV replication to develop preliminary SARs. Aim 2: Assess the mechanism of action of HPO and HNO inhibitors and evaluate potential synergy with  ACV and foscarnet to suppress HSV replication. Aim 1 will use our well-established, robust screening procedure that tests inhibition of HSV replication by the compounds, toxicity, and in vitro absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion (ADME) to develop the foundational SARs needed to formulate focused chemical hypotheses to be tested in future medicinal chemical optimization. Aim 2 will investigate the compounds' mechanism of action and use our replication inhibition assay in matrix fashion to test the potential for HPOs and/or HNOs to be useful in combination therapy with each other or with nucleoside analogs or second-line drugs. Follow-up studies will identify lead compounds for development into drugs to improve therapy and relieve suffering due to HSV and other herpesviruses."
"9389514","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Large conductance calcium-activated potassium (BK) channels are major ionic determinants in mediating vasorelaxation and are the target of endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factors (EDHFs). We have found that regulation of BK channels by EDHFs is abnormal in diabetic animals and the intrinsic properties of BK channels are altered in diabetic coronary arteries. BK channels in coronary arterial smooth muscle cells from diabetic animals have reduced sensitivity to calcium- and voltage-dependent activation. We have demonstrated that the mechanism by which vascular BK channel regulation is altered in Type 1 and Type II diabetes involves hyperglycemia-induced oxidative stress, where the cysteine residues in BK channels are targets of redox modulation. The C911 residue of the BK channel pore subunit is particularly sensitive to modulation by hyperglycemia-induced oxidative stress. In addition, the BK-?subunit is significantly down regulated in diabetes as a result of hyperglycemia- induced up regulation of F-Box Only proteins, which are components of the SCF-type ubiquitin ligase complex that facilitates the degradation of BK-? The goal of this project is to further delineate the molecular mechanisms through which reactive oxygen species (ROS) modulate BK channels in diabetes. Since Nrf2 (Nuclear factor E-2 related factor 2) has emerged as a master regulator of cellular detoxification and redox status, we will test the hypothesis that Nrf2 signaling plays a central role in the regulation of BK channel function in diabetes. Three specific aims are proposed. Aim 1 will examine the mechanism of BK-?hannel regulation by Nrf2 signaling in diabetes. We will determine the role of Nrf2 down regulation in diabetes on BK-?xidation and function, as well as the role of caveolae targeting in such regulation. Aim 2 will examine the mechanism of BK-?regulation by Nrf2 signaling in diabetes. We will determine the role of Nrf2 down regulation in diabetes on BK-?degradation through the ubiquitin- proteasome system. Aim 3 will examine the treatment of diabetic animal models by Nrf2 activators and their effects on vascular BK channel function and vasoreactivity. These studies will be performed using in vitro and in vivo models of diabetes. Whole-cell and single channel patch clamp techniques, biochemical, pharmacological, Ca2+ imaging, and physiological and molecular biological approaches, including the use of specific transgenic mice, will be employed to determine the role of Nrf2 signaling and the effects of diabetes on BK channel function and degradation. The results of this project may provide important novel insights into the molecular mechanisms of altered BK channel function that may contribute to vascular dysfunction in diabetes. The results may also allow the development of novel approaches in the treatment of BK channelopathy and vascular abnormalities in diabetes."
"9393828","ABSTRACT The Prevention Research Center (PRC), a division of Pacific Institute for Research and Evaluation (PIRE), was formed in October 1983 around the Environmental Approaches to Prevention Research Center grant, selected by peer review as the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism's (NIAAA's) national Center for prevention research. The goals of the Center are: (1) to undertake innovative basic research that contributes to the development of cost-effective environmental prevention programs and policies at the local, state, and national levels; (2) to undertake research of applied and practical importance to inform policies and programs to prevent alcohol-related problems, especially in the area of environmental factors; (3) to summarize and synthesize new and existing knowledge about prevention theories, policies, and programs, and to disseminate this information to professional, academic, and community audiences; and (4) to provide multidisciplinary training and research opportunities for post-doctoral fellows and other early investigators. We take a multidisciplinary approach to prevention research that emphasizes integration across theories from the biological to the behavioral and social sciences to enhance our understanding of the causal impacts of drinking environments on drinking patterns and problems. Research we are proposing for the renewal of the Center continues this approach, building upon extensive work conducted among cities in California in the previous rounds, and continuing to focus on the micro- and macro-ecological contexts of alcohol use. We will consider the social and situational conditions that affect early initiation of underage alcohol use, intoxication, and progression to heavier drinking and related problems (Component #3). Identification of these conditions will improve our understanding of how micro-environments affect early developmental trajectories and guide us toward effective preventive interventions to reduce underage alcohol use. We will examine young adult drinking patterns and problems in large Hispanic/Latino communities situated along the California-Mexico border and some distance away in order to assess how macro- and micro-ecological differences in access to alcohol affect drinking and problems in this subpopulation (Component #4). This study will illuminate sources of alcohol-related health disparities that arise among Hispanic/Latino drinkers and help us identify those unique drinking contexts and situations for which effective preventive interventions should be designed. We will investigate the dynamic inter-relationships of alcohol use, problems, and AUD symptomatology among heavy drinkers in order to establish how micro-ecological contexts of heavy drinking might be manipulated to reduce the large number of problems that arise in communities in association with AUDs (Component #5). For the first time in any environmental research program we will integrate theoretical models and empirical data from these studies into an agent-based modeling framework that allows us to test a select set of scenarios that involve altering social ecological mechanisms that could ameliorate alcohol- related problems in communities (the Framework for Reconstructing Epidemiological Dynamics, FRED; Component #6). Finally, we will continue our focus on providing information and dissemination of community-based preventive intervention research, expanding our utilization of social media (Component #2)."
"9473303","The activation of neurotransmitter receptors at synapses mediate synaptic transmission upon being bound by neurotransmitters released from presynaptic terminals. The predominant inhibitory transmitter in the brain is gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), and ionotropic GABAA receptors localize at inhibitory synapses to mediate fast inhibitory transmission. Dysregulation of GABA receptors causes various mental and neurological disorders including autism spectrum disorder, schizophrenia, epilepsy, and other disorders. However, precise mechanisms for synaptic localization of GABAA receptors remain unclear. We have recently identified novel GARLH family proteins as a critical regulator of synaptic GABAARs. In this proposal, we aim to reveal in vivo roles of GARLHs in regulating GABAAR activity in the brain, principle rules of GARLH-GABAAR interactions, and molecular relationships of constituents of inhibitory synapses. Successful completion of this proposed work will reveal fundamental molecular mechanisms for determining synaptic localization and transmission of GABAA receptors in the brain. Elucidating the molecular rules governing inhibitory transmission will enable us to identify putative molecular targets for drugs that may alleviate impair neurological and mental disorders."
"9469876","Project Abstract Cerebrovascular diseases, as one of the leading causes of death and disability in all societies, impose enormous social-economic burden worldwide. Cerebral angiography plays an indispensable role in differential diagnosis, prognosis outlook, therapeutic management, and follow-up after treatment for patients with neurological vasopathology, such as stroke, arterial stenosis, cerebral venous sinus thrombosis , arteriovenous malformation, and aneurysm. Traditionally, catheter-based X-ray angiography has been considered the gold standard for cerebrovascular assessment. Contrast-enhanced (CE) MRA allows large spatial coverage, high spatial resolution, and rapid acquisition. However, arterial visualization are often obscured by venous enhancement. In addition, the safety of Gd based CE MRA has been challenged for the concerns of developing Nephrogenic Systemic Fibrosis (NSF) for patients with impaired kidney function and the reports of Gd deposition in the brain even when no kidney disease is present . Thus non-contrast-enhanced MR angiography (NCE MRA) has rapidly evolved to minimize risk and lower cost. The primary NCE cerebral MRA in clinical practice is the 3D time-of- flight (TOF) method, which is known to have limited angiographic coverage and poor delineation of slow flow. Newly developed arterial spin labeling (ASL) MRA can provide either large spatial coverage or 4D time-resolved MRA with dynamic filling of arteries. The drawback of the ASL methods are the reduced signal efficiency, lengthened scan times due to the required two acquisitions for subtraction of labeled and unlabeled blood signal, and sensitivity to motion-induced misregistration. We recently demonstrated feasibility of a novel velocity- selective (VS) MRA approach for cerebral applications at 3T, which is a non-subtractive technique and allows large coverage and slow-flow depiction. Aiming to incorporate favorable aspects of both TOF and ASL MRA methods, we propose numerous technical advances for VS MRA to render 3D arteriography, venography and 4D time-resolved MRA. The purpose of this study is first to further develop these VS cerebral MRA techniques in flow phantoms and healthy subjects (Aim 1), then to evaluate the 3D VS MR arteriography in patients with carotid or intracranial stenosis (Aim 2) and the 3D VS MR venography in patients with cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (Aim 3), and finally to evaluate the 4D time-resolved VS-MRA in patients with AVM or aneurysm (Aim 4). The proposed NCE VS MRA techniques are expected to show clinical values not only for the brain, but also for the rest of the body, and especially benefit children, pregnant women, and patients with diabetes or impaired kidney function ."
"9404951","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of this research and training plan is to define the molecular mechanisms underlying tauopathies. Tau aggregates are a hallmark pathological feature of tauopathies, which include Alzheimer's disease, progressive supranuclear palsy, frontotemporal dementia, corticobasal degeneration and Pick's disease. While Parkinson's disease is not usually characterized as a tauopathy, a common tau gene (MAPT) haplotype is an established risk factor for disease. This project aims to define the molecular mechanisms underlying tauopathies, will improve our understanding of how tau genetics influences tau biology, and will inform novel avenues for therapeutic intervention. The investigator, Dr. Celeste Karch, will gain advanced training in stem cell biology, genomics, and axonal imaging in support of an innovative approach that establishes novel cell models that use human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived neurons, zinc finger nucleases, and axonal imaging to study the extent to which genetic changes in MAPT, the gene that encodes the tau protein, disrupts tau metabolism in tauopathies. The mentors, who were selected for this training, Drs. Alison Goate, Marc Diamond, Jeffrey Milbrandt, and Yadong Huang, are internationally recognized experts in the fields of human and molecular genetics, tau aggregation, axonal degeneration, and stem cell biology, respectively. The goal of this proposal is to determine how genomic variants in tau that are associated with risk for tauopathies contribute to the development of these diseases using human iPSC-derived neurons. The overarching hypothesis of this proposal is that common mechanisms exist by which disease mutations and risk haplotypes disrupt tau metabolism and contribute to disease pathogenesis. To define these common mechanisms, I will measure several modalities of tau metabolism in iPSC-derived neurons from disease mutation and risk haplotype carriers. Through this research and mentored training plan, Dr. Karch will begin to define the molecular mechanisms underlying tauopathies and will establish new experimental tools and approaches that will form the foundation for a career as an independent, translational neuroscientist."
"9395994","Project Summary/Abstract B follicular helper T (Tfh) cells are essential participants of both normal immune responses and autoimmune disease. Tfh cells function to coordinate humoral responses through contact dependent and independent help signals to B cells in the germinal centers (GCs) of secondary lymphoid organs. Within GCs, Tfh cells support B cell proliferation and survival, immunoglobulin affinity maturation, and memory B cell and plasma cell formation. In the autoimmune setting, Tfh promote aberrant GC B cell and memory B cell responses that contribute to autoantibody induced pathology. Disruption of this axis of help provides clinical benefit. The mechanisms that dictate Tfh cell function, differentiation, and survival are incompletely described, however. Upon differentiation, effector CD4 T cells change in bioenergetic demand and adopt metabolic profiles compatible with their proliferative and functional needs. We recently demonstrated that Tfh cells are not only functionally and spatially different from their Th1 counterparts, but also represent a metabolically distinct subset in response to acute viral infection, an environment flexible for experimentation and mimicry of the elevated type I interferon signaling in autoimmune diseases like systemic lupus erythematosus. This project aims to provide further insight into the metabolic programs defined by and required for Tfh cell differentiation. The two following specific aims will address the hypothesis that Tfh cells require distinct metabolic programs for their differentiation and function in vivo. In Aim 1, we will conduct a targeted CRISPR/Cas9 knockout library screen of all genes in the mouse metabolome, a set defined by genes encoding all enzymes, membrane transporters and channels, and cofactors that govern cellular metabolism. This will determine metabolic regulators of Tfh and Th1 cell differentiation and function. We will use this initial screen to validate pathways of interest, to build a metabolome map of T cell regulatory pathways, and to discover novel targets of inhibition to effect Tfh cell differentiation. Aim 2 will interrogate the fatty acid synthesis pathway in Tfh development and function, as previous work has implicated regulators of this pathway as important for Tfh cell identity. Further, a preliminary screen implicated a requirement for multiple genes in this pathway for Tfh cell differentiation and/or survival. In addition, this fellowship proposal presents the applicant's research career plan, describing in detail how the resources available to him within the Yale Immunobiology Graduate Program, his choice of Drs. Joe Craft and Richard Flavell as co-mentors, and his plans for professional and ethical development will serve him in becoming an independent biomedical academic research scientist."
"9468128","Project Summary Complex host-microbe interactions that define immunological health and disease may begin in utero1?3 and therefore, chronic inflammatory diseases could be prevented before birth. Our bodies are inhabited by vast microbial ecosystems, which are shaped by time4, diet5, and environmental exposures6. The microbiome also shapes the host: it regulates immune development, homeostasis, and susceptibility to disease development at mucosal sites and organ systems7. The long-held assumption that the uterine environment is sterile has been challenged by many groups, because bacteria were detected in the placenta2,3,8, fetal membranes9, amniotic fluid2, and human meconium1,2,10,11 (the first neonatal bowel movement composed of swallowed amniotic fluid). These studies are fundamental, because ecologically we know that pioneering species colonizing a pristine habitat can play a substantial role in defining ecosystem conditions and the trajectory of primary succession, or the process of species accumulation and replacement over time12. Human immune development also occurs in utero, with a predisposition to generate tolerance through preferential Treg cell differentiation to self- and maternal antigens14. Studies in neonates have underscored the importance of microbial pioneers on chronic inflammatory disease development in later life17,18 and is potentiated by bacterial metabolite effects on T cell immunity. I have generated preliminary data to support the existence of a microbiome in human fetal intestines and that fetal meconium communities dominated by Lactobacillus are enriched for regulatory T (Treg) cells in the adjacent intestinal lamina propria. Treg cells represent a key subset of adaptive immunity that promotes immunological tolerance. Thus, I hypothesize that the simple microbial communities found in the human fetal intestine are metabolically active and influence pre-natal immune tolerance development via their impact on Treg cell populations. To test this, I will determine the metabolic composition of fetal meconium and identify metabolites that are enriched in Lactobacillus-dominated samples. Enriched metabolites will be validated for induction of Treg cell differentiation ex vivo and genetic pathways for biosynthesis of these metabolites will be interrogated via metagenomic sequencing. Next, I will introduce commensal Lactobacillus johnsonii (LJ) that has been engineered to stably and constitutively express a GFP transgene (LJ-GFP) to pregnant dams vaginally or orally and localize LJ-GFP in murine fetal tissues. This will allow me to determine which route of commensal inoculation results in fetal intestinal colonization. I will then determine fetal intestinal metabolic alterations due to maternal supplementation just before delivery and assess the impact of LJ supplementation during pregnancy on post-natal induction of immune tolerance, using a cockroach allergen sensitization model post-weaning25. The completion of this study will serve as a fundamental cornerstone for developing microbial interventions during pregnancy to prevent a host of inflammatory diseases, such as childhood allergic sensitization and adult asthma."
"9451023","Development of predictive coding networks for spatial navigation Summary: Mammalian navigation uses internal models to predict the spatial-temporal statistical regularity of the sequence of environmental locations. Predictive coding theories view the brain as Bayesian interpreter that computes the difference between the external stimuli and an internal model of the world. It is increasingly understood that sequential spatial information is represented by temporal sequences of ensemble neuronal firing in the hippocampus. Without exception, these ensemble patterns have been investigated exclusively in adult animals. A small handful of studies measured the activity of individual hippocampal neurons as pre- weanling or juvenile animals briefly explored open-field environments. However, spatial experience is believed to be internally represented by highly compressed temporal sequences of neuronal ensemble firing during awake and sleep states in the form of theta sequences, replay, and preplay, which are expressed within populations rather than single neurons. Our goal is to reveal the principles and stages of early-life development and maturation of attractor-based compressed temporal sequences as priors for encoding future navigation experiences (i.e., predictive coding), and the role age and early spatial experience play in these processes and in navigation learning. To achieve this goal, we develop new methods to: 1. Chronically record, at millisecond resolution, from large ensembles of neurons (up to 70 simultaneously) from the hippocampus in developing freely-behaving and sleeping rats from first day after eye opening; 2. Reveal and analyze predictive coding network properties; 3. Control and restrict animals? prior spatial experience. Successful completion of this proposal will provide unique resources to help understand the emergence and maturation of cortical networks for internally-generated representations and will provide links and predictive models to study perturbations in neuronal ensemble patterns underlying neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders like schizophrenia and autism spectrum disorder."

"9425420","Premalignant field often refers to histologically normal epithelial cells surrounding a tumor that carry some of the same genetic and/or epigenetic changes as in the tumor. Such cells and tumor cells surrounded by them may have a common clonal origin. A premalignant field can be formed upon its cell-of-origin acquiring a clonal growth advantage over its neighbor cells. Normally clonal competition between equipotent epithelial cells is neutral. However, some genetic mutations can tilt the neutral competition so that the mutated cells have increased ?fitness? and a higher chance to replace their neighbors, whereas other mutations can only do so upon interaction with environmental modifiers. A better understanding of how the interplay of genetic, epigenetic and environmental factors tilts the stochastic process of neutral clonal competition is the key for understanding how premalignant field is formed and how it can be targeted. p53 mutation is the most common mutation in human breast cancer and represents an early event in breast tumorigenesis. By inducing p53-loss in a small number of Keratin 8+ luminal mammary epithelial cells (MECs), we observed a premalignant field comprised of p53-deficient luminal MECs; mammary tumors later emerged from it with 100% penetrance. Since constitutive p53 knockout mice have a largely normal MEC phenotype, we hypothesize that this p53-deficient luminal premalignant field is formed upon interplay of p53-mutant luminal MECs and environmental factors (e.g., ovarian hormones, immune cells). As proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis of MECs are controlled by cyclic ovarian hormones, Aim 1 will determine if induced p53-deficiency in estrogen receptor (ER)+ or ER- luminal MECs triggers an imbalance of proliferation versus apoptosis between p53 mutant cells and their wild-type neighbors, resulting in a net accumulation of p53-deficent luminal cells over time, in an estrous cycle-dependent manner. Aim 2 will further determine the role of cyclic changes of ovarian hormones in establishing the p53-deficient luminal premalignant field, by ovariectomy, hormone (estrogen, progesterone) replacement, and tamoxifen treatment. Expression profiling of p53-deficient luminal MECs revealed a unique immune-related signature suggestive of immunosuppression; our preliminary study further demonstrated that M2-polarized macrophages could enhance growth of luminal MECs. Based on these data, Aim 3 will investigate potential roles of various immune cell types, in particular, macrophages (e.g., M2-polarized), in shaping the p53- deficient luminal premalignant field. Overall, a better understanding of how interaction of the hormone milieu and immune cells in the mammary gland with p53-mutant luminal MECs contributes to development of this p53-deficient premalignant field is expected to lead to novel strategies of breast cancer prevention, particular in high-risk populations (e.g., Li-Fraumeni syndrome patients). The idea and approach proposed here may also have broad-reaching implications in understanding premalignant fields in other cancer types."
"9453357","Project Summary Neisseria gonorrhoeae reproductive tract infections can lead to chronic and severe consequences in women, where diagnosis is frequently delayed by lack of symptoms, contrary to male infections. A once-simple antibiotic treatment gonococcal infection is now compromised by a worldwide increased antibiotic resistance, including the last FDA-approved antibiotic cefixime. The CDC has recently placed N. gonorrhoeae in the urgent threat category of antibiotic resistant microorganisms. There is a strong need for a vaccine against gonorrhea, but this has been delayed by combined lack of successful antigens and animal models of N. gonorrhoeae infections to evaluate protective immunity. Discovery of new bacterial antigens has been enabled by the assumption that pathogens express virulence factors explicitly in vivo. These may have consequently escaped detection in vitro. Based on previous NIH-funded grants (U19 AI084048 and R56 AI107821-01A1), we have examined the global transcriptome of cervico-vaginal lavage and urethral samples from human subjects naturally infected with N. gonorrhoeae attending the National Center for STD Control (NCSTD) in Nanjing, China, by RNA-seq. We reported a differential mRNA expression in these samples as compared to that from each infecting strains grown in vitro, for a large number of genes. We have defined these ?in vivo expressed factors? (IVEFs). Among the IVEFs there are several hypothetical proteins, representing a previously untapped pool of potential new antigens for a N. gonorrhoeae vaccine. These novel IVEFs vaccine candidates have not been examined before because they had not been identified so far. We have used multiple in silico-based predictive criteria to select several hypothetical protein IVEFs to be tested in vitro and in vivo as novel broad vaccine targets. Besides being highly expressed in vivo, the desired features of the selected IVEFs include: broad expression among gonococcal strains; predicted antigenicity; predicted bacterial membrane localization (outer membrane or periplasmic) and surface exposure and lastly, structure features suitable for recombinant production. In addition to predicted antigenicity, some IVEFs share DNA sequence homology to currently explored immunogenic meningococcal vaccine candidates. We will initially focus on 19 IVEFs for recombinant expression and antigenic/immunogenic characterization in mice. Immunogenicity as well as recognition of IVEFs in whole bacteria will be validated using banked hyperimmune sera from subjects naturally exposed to the gonococcus, for which we will use purified IVEFs as well as IVEF over-expression gonococcal mutant strains created in both laboratory strains and clinical isolates from the Nanjing cohort. We will test the ability of mouse immune sera and vaginal lavages as well as banked human sera to induce killing of N. gonorrhoeae in vitro to further establish IVEFs as broad vaccine antigens."
"9444924","Changes in cell, tissue and organism metabolism commonly accompany development, and also major disorders like cancer and cardiovascular diseases. Such metabolic changes result in prominent alterations in cell surface carbohydrate structures. Thus, the measurement of cellular glycan changes can report on the underlying metabolic processes. These changing glycan profiles also regulate cell function, and thus their quantitative measurement can provide insight into human pathophysiology. While the measurement of glycans on naturally occurring proteins is beneficial, the expression of such glycoproteins can be heterogeneous even for the same cell type from different donors, or blood biomarkers from a similar patient population. Further, glycan profiling typically involves sample destruction since glycans are extracted from cells or tissue prior to analyses using mass spectrometry, lectin microarrays or other methods. In this regard, it would be attractive to develop a tool/technology that will enable the non-destructive longitudinal study of tissue specific, glycan structure changes both for ex vivo and in vivo applications. To address this unmet need, this proposal develops a new reagent toolkit called ?synthetic glycan biomarkers? (?SynGlycans?) for the measurement of dynamic changes in cellular carbohydrate profiles. In this regard, SynGlycan are non-natural, designer probes that are optimized for: 1. Secretion from cells, with SynGlycan products being found in either blood or urine in animal models and 2. Targeted mass spectrometry based quantitative analysis. Such reagents may be used for longitudinal studies in a variety of disease contexts, since they can be designed to be expressed at a high level, in a spatially and temporally controlled manner. In order to test this concept, proof-of-principle studies are proposed here to overcome key technical challenges. The specific aims are: Aim 1: To design, develop and iteratively refine synthetic glycan biomarkers using cell based assays. This aim will refine a family of SynGlycans to identify a few that are expressed at high levels and that describe the major features of cellular metabolic pathways. Aim 2: To assay the temporal evolution of carbohydrate structures in murine disease models by applying synthetic glycan biomarkers in longitudinal studies. This aim uses a murine colorectal cancer model to measure SynGlycan products secreted into blood and urine. If successful, the core technology developed here can be multiplexed with other existing technologies like inducible-promoters, tissue-specific promoters, imaging-constructs, CRISPR and additional synthetic probes to obtain a rich, ?systems-level view? of whole cell/animal physiology. Once the technology is fully developed, we envision that these probes will be broadly useful as they can be introduced in any system or organism of interest. In the long term, safe expression of such molecules in host may also provide novel molecular diagnostic tools for early disease detection that complements the current focus on natural biomarkers. Overall, this application will result in a new molecular technology and broadly useful tool for biomedical research."
"9403157","Abstract  Engineered nanomaterials (ENM) have great therapeutic potential but their biological interactions are still largely unknown. Previous studies have shown that ENM are capable of inducing microvascular dysfunction but its currently unknown if this dysfunction is due to direct ENM contact or alterations in circulating factors (i.e. chemokines and cytokines) in the plasma. Finally, with the increasing use of ENM in commercial and therapeutic products, there is an immediate need to create high-throughput screening methods to identify endothelial toxicity associated with ENMs. This proposal aims to use a novel approach, which applies ?omic? approaches to better understand the microvascular dysfunction and toxicity associated with ENM. Therefore, we hypothesize that the physicochemical properties of engineered nanomaterials contribute to unique proteomic and transcriptomic profiles in the vascular system, which direct the observed microvascular dysfunction. This hypothesis will be tested using two specific aims, consisting of in vitro and in vivo techniques. The goal of Aim 1 is to analyze the influences of the physicochemical properties of ENM on microvascular dysfunction. Furthermore, this aim will analyze the ability of secondary circulating factors (i.e. chemokines and cytokines) to induce microvascular dysfunction in an ex vivo setting. The ENM used in this aim will be modified to induce electronic defects, which will alter their ability to transfer and accept electrons when in a biological environment and ultimately affect their toxicity. These ENM will be screened using in vitro techniques to analyze endothelial toxicity and identify the ENMs with the lowest and highest toxicity. After these ENM are identified, mice will be intravenously injected to analyze the microvascular dysfunction associated with these ENM. Plasma will be collected from the mice following exposure and used to treat naïve arterioles. We predict that this treatment will induce microvascular dysfunction due to the changes in circulating chemokines and cytokines. These assessments will help to determine if direct ENM contact or secondary circulating factors are the leading cause of microvascular dysfunction following ENM exposure. The second aim will utilize a transciptome-proteome approach to quantitatively identify changes in circulating proteins and their subsequent downstream effects on transcriptomic responses in the microvasculature. The use of bioinformatics to integrate exposure changes at both the transcript and protein level will provide a unique analysis of microvascular dysfunction, which will aid in the identification of biomarkers for high-throughput screening methods and the mechanism of action for ENM induced microvascular dysfunction."
"9455994","We hypothesize that intestinal colonization with the human commensal Clostridium scindens epigenetically alters the bone marrow to increase granulocyte precursors that protect the gut from parasite infection. We will test our hypothesis via two complementary aims. In Aim 1 Test if C. scindens-mediated protection is dependent on bone marrow derived cells. In Aim 2 Determine if C. scindens epigenetically alters genes important in generation or recruitment of gut myeloid cells via JMJD3. Successful completion of these studies: will identify how intestinal Clostridia induce epigenetic changes in the bone marrow that in turn induce gut antigen-nonspecific ?trained innate immunity?. Significance: There is an urgent need for novel approaches to treat or prevent Entamoeba histolytica as it is an important cause of diarrhea in infants in low income countries. There is no vaccine and only a single class of antiparasitics effective for invasive amebiasis. Innovation: This work will provide a robust understanding of Clostridium scindens-mediated protection from amebiasis and provide understanding of fundamental processes underlying innate trained immunity induced by the host microbiota. Novel theoretical concepts derived from this work will identify pathways important in microbiota-mediated protection from parasite infection that can be targeted by translational medicine. The environment for this work is a research group dedicated to the study of the pathogenesis of amebic colitis for the last 25 years. Our work has described the natural history of amebiasis in children and adults, developed the amebiasis mouse model, and led to understanding of innate and acquired immunity to E. histolytica."
"9441080","Project Summary Triple negative breast cancers (TNBCs) comprise only a subset of all breast cancers, yet they are highly aggressive and offer the worst prognosis. It is estimated that 40,000 American women will be affected by this disease in 2016. Recurrence rate is high after chemotherapeutic treatment, and to date no targeted therapies are available. There is thus an urgent need for new treatment options. Despite large-scale genome sequencing efforts, known breast cancer loci still explain only one- third of the cancer risk, thus limiting the identification of many high risk individuals. It is therefore imperative to identify additional breast cancer susceptibility genes and elucidate their mechanisms of action to develop comprehensive cancer risk assessment and targeted therapeutics. Our recent discovery that the DNA damage signaling protein BRCT-repeat inhibitor of hTERT expression (BRIT1) specifically interacts with TRF2 at telomeres in TNBCs is novel and provide new insights into mechanisms of how telomeres in these cells are protected from activating a DNA damage response. This knowledge will be highly valuable for the generation of new therapeutics against this deadly disease."
"9390059","All three projects rely on genetically modified mice and the production of purified proteins and polyclonal and  monoclonal antibodies. Accordingly, all three projects will be supported by the Mouse Model and Protein  Expression Core (Core A), led by Dr. Loren Fong. Dr. Fong is an expert in a wide variety of practical  techniques in cellular and molecular biology, including growing and manipulating mouse embryonic stem  cells and the use of mouse models in biomedical research. This expertise has paid huge dividends for this  PPG. Dr. Fong, working with Drs.

In addition, the Core houses and genotypes mice,  backcrosses mice onto inbred strains, maintains animal protocols, and organizes histological studies on  mouse models.  The Core also produces purified proteins for biochemical studies and for generating polyclonal and  monoclonal antibodies; this has been an essential function, since our PPG has focused on newly discovered  molecules, for which few reagents exist. During the prior funding period, Drs. Bensadoun, Fong and Young  produced multiple antibody reagents for this PPG. Their expertise and experience will be a boon for the new  antibody projects proposed in this application. Aside from antibody reagents, the Core will also produce  purified recombinant proteins for biochemical and structural biology studies. All three projects of the PPG  will use Core A.  RELEVANCE (See instructions):  This Program Project Grant proposes to define the molecular mechanisms that regulate lipid metabolism and  adiposity-two events that play centrol roles in the pathogenesis of metablic disesase (e.g., obeisity and  atherosclerosis).

"9458387","Skin, muscle, joints, and internal organs encapsulate specialized sensory neurons that detect mechanical cues in the form of touch and movement. The ability to perform most, if not all of the essential activities of daily living depends on information from these somatosensory, proprioceptive, and visceral sensory neurons. Thus, a better understanding of their function and sensitivity to mechanical and chemical stress is of vital importance for health. This research program focuses on the skin-neuron composite tissues responsible for touch and seeks to decipher how mechanical force is translated from the skin surface to embedded sensory neurons and converted into electrical signals that give rise to tactile perceptions. The work combines genetic dissection in a simple invertebrate (C. elegans nematodes) with electron microscopy, high-performance tools (self-sensing cantilevers) for delivering mechanical stimuli under feedback control and for optically monitoring tissue deformation and neuronal activation with electrophysiology and calcium imaging. The research team includes biologists, engineers and physicists and integrates experimental work with theory and simulation. In addition to seeking a comprehensive understanding of mechanosensation by skin-neuron composites, the research program will also address the outstanding question of how neurons bend without breaking. Based on preliminary work, we also plan to leverage our knowledge of touch sensation and its molecular basis to investigate how chemical stressors linked to diabetes (glucose) and chemotherapy (paclitaxel) affect the function and morphology of skin-neuron composites. The knowledge we seek to acquire is relevant to all animals, including humans that rely on skin-neuron composites for touch sensation."
"9581870","Abstract It is possible to combine technologies based on single molecules to achieve de novo genome sequence assembly with phasing and genome-wide structural variation identification. De novo assembled whole genome sequencing fully describes the diploid human genome except for a small number of long, highly repetitive sequences such as the centromeres, telomeres, and near-identical segmental duplications. Key to the success of phased genome sequence assembly is the single molecule mapping approach developed by our group that starts with sequence-specific labeling of long (180 kb to >1 Mb), double-stranded genomic DNA fragments with fluorophores followed by high-throughput, automated imaging and analysis of the linearized fluorescent DNA molecules in nanochannel arrays on a commercially available instrument. During the next phase of this project, we propose to produce phased genome sequence assemblies of 2 individuals from each of all 26 ethnic groups of the 1000 Genomes Project to serve as general references for the community. In addition, we will further develop the technology to map repetitive elements that are difficult to interrogate genome-wide and to precisely phase target regions over a long range. The approach we are taking to construct de novo phased and assembled genomes will produce ?near reference grade? genomes with high efficiency at low cost for many ethnic groups around the world. These reference sequences will increase substantially the value of all the whole genome sequences already obtained and provide further insight into structural variation patterns across human populations. The technology development aims of this proposal will address some of the most difficult questions facing genome analysis today. At the end of this three-year project, a robust method for phased genome assembly, repetitive sequence mapping, and long-range phasing will be developed and ready for application in many areas of genome research."
"9427252","Project Summary/Abstract. Understanding the evolutionary history of living organisms is of central importance to every field of biological and biomedical research. Evolutionary information is critical to the discovery process across all biological scales, from proteins to populations. The CIPRES Science Gateway (CIPRES) is a global resource that speeds up inference of evolutionary history from DNA sequence data. CIPRES provides public access to community phylogenetics software run on high performance computing (HPC) resources at no cost to the user. CIPRES allows investigators to access all the capabilities of phylogenetics software efficiently though a browser interface, without having to install the codes, learn the details of schedulers, and construct command lines. CIPRES is the sole public resource for many of these codes, completes analyses 5-30 fold faster than a typical laptop computer, allows users to run many analyses simultaneously, and provides indefinite storage of the results. At present, approximately 2,000 users per month submit 20,000 jobs through CIPRES; they have produced more than 3,000 peer reviewed publications in subject areas relevant to NIH priorities, from enzymology to epidemiology. CIPRES has provided support for research ranging from HIV virus transmission to the discovery of an entire new branch in the tree of life. All of these discoveries happen more quickly because CIPRES provides easy access to HPC resources. The project proposed here will improve the software used to create CIPRES, making it more effective and easier to access. It will provide an environment that allows researchers to easily collaborate, share data selectively, and make their results publicly available. It will expose access to CIPRES services through other important software environments, including Galaxy and Geneious. The project will add a number of user-requested features so work is more efficient, including restarting jobs that have terminated prematurely, transferring large files, and input file validation with automatic configuration of jobs for optimal execution. The project will provide access to many new community codes that have been requested, and those that appear during the project lifetime. Improvements to the interface will make it faster, more intuitive, and useable on smart phones and tablets. The project will also give users ?cloud-bursting? capabilities. Users will be able to submit jobs to a commercial cloud provider on a fee-for-service basis or via NIH commons account when their job is too large for the standard CIPRES community resources. This capability means CIPRES can be scaled and sustained indefinitely for a user population of any size. These improvements (both in capabilities and compute capacity) are expected to greatly expand the number of users who incorporate CIPRES into their day-to-day workflow. The improvements made here will be available to the global research community through release of the underlying software as an open source, distributable package that can be used by any community of practice to access HPC resources. As a result, all improvements created for CIPRES users can be implemented simply and quickly in other online resources for other specific research communities."
"9449186","Abstract  Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is a major public health problem, affecting 600,000 Americans annually with a healthcare cost of $10 billion and more than 100,000 deaths. The American Heart Association recommends catheter-directed thrombolytics or mechanical interventions for critical obstructions to prevent amputation of the afflicted limb or death. These treatment regimens are not effective for the chronic thrombus components present in 27 to 43% of DVT cases. Histotripsy is a novel form of therapeutic ultrasound that employs the mechanical action of bubble clouds to ablate tissue and induce fluid mixing. The scientific premise of this study is histotripsy, a therapeutic ultrasound modality that employs the mechanical action of bubble clouds, induces vigorous fluid mixing for improved thrombolytic delivery and liquefaction of chronic, well organized thrombi. Our preliminary studies demonstrate synergy between histotripsy and the thrombolytic recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) that enhances thrombolysis of a retracted venous clot in vitro. We have also shown histotripsy ablation occurs only after a threshold amount of bubble cloud activity. These preliminary data strongly support our central hypothesis that the mechanical action of histotripsy-induced bubble clouds enhances a catheter-directed thrombolytic. In particular, histotripsy causes ablation of chronic thrombus through bubble cloud formation, and increased rt-PA efficacy via bubble cloud-enhanced fluid mixing. Furthermore, catheter-infusion of thrombus-targeted echogenic drug delivery vesicles will improve thrombolysis through localized rt-PA delivery and thrombus ablation. We will examine this hypothesis through the following three specific aims: In Specific Aim 1, we will develop a prototype DVT histotripsy system to facilitate simultaneous 1-MHz histotripsy exposure, therapy image guidance, and treatment progress monitoring. In Specific Aim 2, we will determine the conditions for histotripsy-enhanced thrombolysis. These data will quantify the synergistic effects observed between the histotripsy excitation and thrombolytic drugs for clot lysis. In Specific 3, recanalization of DVT with histotripsy and thrombolytic will be assessed in vivo. Successful completion of the proposed studies will elucidate the efficacy and potential risks of histotripsy for venous thrombosis, and provide new information to assist the development of targeted ablation methods to improve thrombolysis in the treatment of currently intractable deep vein thrombosis."
"9393539","Project Summary: Changes in glutamate neurotransmission in the transition to aversion-resistant alcohol drinking (CTG) Alcohol use disorders (AUDs) are among the most pervasive and costly health issues in the United States and decades of research has provided strong evidence that genetics, and in particular a family history of alcoholism, plays a pivotal role in the development of AUDs. Alcoholism is a chronic, relapsing, and progressive disorder and a key feature in the transition to alcohol dependence is the development of aversion resistant (ARD) drinking accompanied by a decrease in control of alcohol drinking. The medial prefrontal cortex (MPF) is a center for decision making and receives input from multiple cortical and limbic brain regions. Two sub-regions of the MPF thought to play different roles in the transition to alcohol dependence are the prelimbic (PL) and infralimbic (IL) cortices with activation of PL circuits increasing drug seeking whereas activity in the IL decreases drug seeking after extinction. Current theories of addiction suggest that the transition to compulsive drinking is associated with the emergence of hyper-glutamatergic activity in brain regions receiving significant glutamatergic input from the PL cortex. A common model used to study ARD in rodents is quinine-resistant drinking, where, after a history of ethanol drinking, rodents show a willingness to drink quinine-adulterated ethanol solutions. The alcohol-preferring (P) rat is an excellent resource to model family history of alcoholism in rats, however, no studies have used this resource to investigate the mechanisms underlying quinine-resistant drinking. This represents a critical gap in the literature which we will begin to address in this application. The long-term goal of this project is to identify neurobiological changes associated with the transition to ARD in a suitable model of AUDs. The objective of this component is to determine the role of glutamate transmission within sub-regions of the MPF in the transition to quinine-resistant alcohol drinking using the P-rat as a genetic model of AUDs. The rationale for this work is that by understanding glutamatergic function in all parts of the reward system we can begin to identify mechanisms that underlie the transition to compulsive drinking. The Central Hypothesis states: the transition to quinine-resistant drinking involves increases in the activity of glutamate systems within the PL cortex, but not the IL cortex. AIM 1 studies how alcohol drinking leading to quinine-resistance drinking by P-rats alters glutamate transmission in the IL and PL cortices, as measured by quantitative microdialysis. AIM 2 examines how the development of quinine-resistance drinking changes the in vivo release of glutamate within the PL and IL cortices during alcohol drinking episodes. AIM 3 will examine the effects of local microinjection of ionotropic glutamate receptor antagonists into the PL and IL cortices on ethanol drinking in quinine-resistant vs. quinine-sensitive P-rats. Overall, the results of this component will help lay the foundation for developing pharmacotherapies for treating AUDs. These results will be bi-directionally informative with the other ARC components and as a group will combine to significantly advance the field."
"9456348","PROJECT SUMMARY Zika virus (ZIKV) is the cause of an ongoing, worldwide epidemic. While mosquitos are the main vector of transmission, studies have shown that ZIKV can be spread between humans through sexual contact. ZIKV infection generally causes a mild, self-resolving illness in most immunocompetent adults. However, infection in pregnant women can lead to devastating outcomes. Epidemiological studies have linked ZIKV infection with a rise in microcephaly cases in Brazil, and subsequent studies in animal models have shown that congenital infection with ZIKV, either through a subcutaneous or intravaginal route, causes microcephaly and other severe birth defects. Vaccine efforts have focused on preventing infection by mosquito bite, and recent studies have uncovered specific antibody epitopes that can protect against the virus. However, it is unclear whether these vaccines and immune correlates will be effective in protecting against sexually transmitted infection (STI). Vaccine design against viral STIs has proven to be difficult and currently, only human papilloma virus (HPV) infection can be prevented by vaccination. Most vaccines depend on generating robust circulating immunity for protection. However, circulating immunity may not be sufficient to protect against viral STIs; rather, tissue-specific immunity may be required. In this proposal, we will use an in vivo model of intravaginal ZIKV infection to determine whether conventional vaccination platforms are sufficient to protect against sexual transmission of ZIKV. We will assess the immune response against intravaginal and subcutaneous ZIKV infection within the female reproductive tract (FRT), identify the components of the primary immune response that are required for controlling infection using genetic mouse models and examine the establishment of local immunity in the FRT. We will then determine whether prior exposure to ZIKV through a subcutaneous route protects against subsequent sexual exposure to ZIKV. Finally, we will test the protective capacity of a conventional vaccine administered through commonly used immunization routes against intravaginal ZIKV infection. We will identify the components of the immune response that are required for protection and determine whether conventional vaccines can establish tissue-resident immunity in the FRT. Together, these studies will reveal the requirements for protection against sexual transmission of ZIKV and determine whether current vaccines that are being tested against ZIKV are sufficient to protect against sexually transmitted ZIKV infection."
"9451165","PROJECT SUMMARY The amygdala plays a central role in diverse learned behaviors. By integrating the sensory information with stress, punishment, and reward signals, the circuitry within the amygdala is thought to be modified during learning to mediate specific behavioral outcomes. However, the circuit principles governing what is changed and how different types of learning give rise to qualitatively distinct behaviors remains largely unknown. It has been recognized that an important step towards dissecting the circuitry mechanism underlying amygdala- dependent learning is to determine the activities of individual neurons within discrete amygdala circuits before, during, and after a learning task. However, this goal has been challenging to achieve for technical reasons. First, the amygdala is buried deep within the brain, making it difficult to access by imaging methods, such as calcium imaging, which has become a technique of choice for interrogating neuronal action potential activities with cellular resolution over large neuronal populations. Second, the stress and reward signals are in part encoded as neuromodulatory activities, which do not usually result in direct changes in neuronal electrical activities and cannot be measured by calcium imaging or voltage measurements. Measuring neuromodulation in vivo, especially during behavior, remains challenging. Adding to the difficulty, the identity of individual amygdala circuits, as well as where each circuit receives input and where it sends output, are only partially understood. We plan to meet these challenges by integrating the most recent, complementary technological advances from the three co-PIs. In defined behavioral paradigms we will image calcium as a proxy for neuronal firing in the amygdalae of behaving mice by performing two-photon imaging via a tiny GRIN lens (?~0.5 mm), which offers optical access to deep brain structures with relatively little damage. Simultaneously through the same GRIN lens, we will image the activity dynamics of the cAMP/protein kinase A (PKA) signaling pathway, which is a common downstream signaling pathway for many neuromodulators, including norepinephrine and dopamine, as readout for stress/reward-induced neuromodulatory signals by using two-photon fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy. In conjunction, we will perform computation-based anatomical circuitry analyses to dissect novel functional subdivisions of the amygdala, and identify the input-output of each subdivision with cell-type specificity. Based on these techniques, we will systematically map circuits, including previously unknown circuits, within the amygdala and determine how neurons from each circuit are recruited by and contribute to the generation of specific behaviors."
"9432313","I am a postdoc with a strong research interest in the neuronal mechanisms underlying altered network connectivity in severe brain injury and impaired consciousness. My immediate goal is to transition into a junior faculty position within the next two years. I have assembled a detailed career and training plan including the development of technical skills to investigate the causal relationship between altered cellular mechanisms and functional connectivity. I have worked in the field of severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) for the last 10 years and have thorough expertise in neuroimaging and network analyses in patients with impaired consciousness. During the mentored phase of this proposed K99 award, I want to expand my methodological repertoire using optogenetic functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to explore the causal effects of impaired neuronal mechanisms on functional connectivity. I propose to receive this training at UCLA under the mentorship of Dr. David Hovda in collaboration with my advisors Drs. Martin Monti, Neil Harris, and Weizhe Hong. Dr. Hovda is a highly respected researcher in the field of TBI and has an outstanding track-record in mentoring young researchers during their transition into independent research. With the help of my advisors I will learn optogenetic fMRI to explore causal effects of altered functional connectivity in TBI. Combining my computational expertise in clinical neuroimaging with the neuroscientific expertise in optogenetic manipulation allows a profound investigation of neuronal mechanisms underlying TBI and significantly enhances my opportunities when becoming an independent researcher. Besides the technical training, I will acquire complementary skills in teaching, lab management, and funding, which are essential when establishing a successful and independent research laboratory. Severe TBI is a leading cause of death and disability. Understanding spontaneous brain reorganization following severe brain injury and its association to recovery of cognitive function is crucial for patient diagnosis, prognosis, and the development of neurorestorative interventions. While there is a strong premise that functional connectivity of several hot spots within the cortico-basal ganglia-thalamo-cortical circuit are associated with impairments in TBI, recent intervention studies focus merely on the thalamus, and thus, ignore the picture as a whole. A systematic investigation manipulating different pathways within this circuit in the TBI model does not exist. During my postdoctoral fellowship, however, I found evidence indicating that the thalamus is not systematically related to recovery of consciousness. The proposed project is now a logical progression from my earlier work. I will (1) implement a method that allows the investigation of causal effects using optogenetics, (2) combine clinical expertise in measuring functional connectivity at the network level with insights into the cellular mechanisms, and (3) systematically explore the whole network (instead of focusing on single targets). My goal is to shed further light on how altered neuronal mechanisms affect fMRI measures in TBI, how these alterations give rise to impaired consciousness and cognitive function, and how this knowledge can then be translated into clinical intervention strategies. In a first step, I will investigate the effects of silencing different cell types and pathways within this circuit on functional connectivity and behavioral measures. These experiments will lead to a better understanding of how impairments at the cellular level modify functional connectivity. In the second part of my project, I will directly compare the effectiveness of stimulation between these different targets in respect to enhanced cortical activation and increased functional connectivity in the TBI model providing guidance for different therapeutic approaches manipulating the neuronal mechanisms within this circuit."
"9387321","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The current knowledge implicating Streptococcus mutans as a major cariogenic bacterium is mainly based on the correlation of human caries rates vs levels of S. mutans in oral cavities or the induction of dental caries via inoculation of . mutans in various animal models. This evidence is substantial but not conclusive as S. mutans is just one of the hundreds of species in oral cavity. Traditional approaches focused on single and dual species interactions are valuable but simply cannot provide the definitive answer on whether or not S. mutans is the keystone cariogenic pathogen responsible for maintaining or shifting the cariogenicity of the oral microbial community towards the disease state. In the previous cycle, we developed state-of-the-art technologies (such as metagenomic-guided community model development, combined SIP with real-time NMR metabolomics, bacterial surface-displayed pH-sensitive green fluorescent protein) that enabled simultaneous detection of oral bacteria (including uncultivable bacteria) and their acidic metabolites within multi-specie dental plaque in situ and in real-time. By connecting S. mutans' pheromone CSP to an antimicrobial peptide, we created a targeted antimicrobial peptide C16G2 with high specificity and sensitivity against S. mutans. We demonstrated its killing ability via selective membrane disruption and validated its safety. These recently developed tools provided new biological insights connecting key bacteria and functions to the cariogenic process in multi-species settings. The interesting and intriguing results derived from these studies provided a strong indication that S. mutans, with an ability to coordinate its three key cariogenic virulence factors (glucan production, acidogenicity and acidurity), can greatly enhance its fitness against acid stress, which could be the reason for its ability to disrupt the normal homeostasis of the oral microbial community and drive conditions towards a disease state. Based on our exciting preliminary data, we developed the following two working hypotheses to address these questions: 1) S. mutans has unique capacities to integrate its three major virulence factors (glucan production, acidogenicity and acidurity) to enhance its fitness in low pH than other oral species, which may be responsible for maintaining the cariogenic activity of the oral microbial community; 2) The targeted removal of S. mutans would allow the reestablishment of the healthy oral microbial community. This application aims to test our hypothesis using a combined genomic, genetic, biochemical and physiological study under both in vitro and in vivo conditions. The success of this study would greatly expand our knowledge of oral microbial pathogenesis by uncovering integrated virulence functions that facilitate survival and persistence of S. mutans. It will also have a direct and immediate impact on the clinical management of dental caries through our new therapeutic interventions."
"9432311","PROJECT SUMMARY This application is for a mentored research and career development program that will enable a motived junior physician-scientist to develop the skills necessary to ultimately become an independent investigator. Successful completion of this project will enable the investigator to gain the sills and knowledge necessary to launch a career investigating the mechanisms responsible for the lung damage present in bronchpulmonary dysplasia (BPD) and potentially develop targeted therapeutics to reverse or cure this damage. BPD is a lung disease that affects more than 14,000 premature infants each year with prolonged health ramifications that affect lung function throughout the patient's life. No curative therapies currently exist for BPD. In previous work, we have shown that epigenetic silencing of a cluster of microRNAs, called miR-17~92, is associated with severe BPD in human patients and murine models of the disease. In order to establish a causal relationship between altered miR-17~92 expression and a BPD phenotype, this project will investigate the central hypothesis that: murine genetic partial-deletion (or haploinsufficiency) of the miR-17~92 cluster will alter alveolar and vascular development reminiscent of a BPD phenotype via exaggerated TGF-?, collagen and matrix metalloproteinase expression. In Aim 1, in vivo and in vitro systems will be used to determine the effects of miR-17~92 haploinsufficiency on pulmonary epithelial development and function. A causal relationship will be determined by reintroduction of miR-17~92 using a viral vector to establish return of function and phenotype. Since there is significant cellular cross-talk driving alveolar and vascular endothelial development, Aim 2 will quantify the effects of haploinsufficiency on pulmonary vascular endothelial development and function. Similar to Aim 1, a causal mechanism will be established with return of function experiments by reintroduction of the full expression of miR-17~92 by viral vector. This novel study will impact the field through understanding the cellular mechanisms altered by suppression and subsequent restoration of the miR-17~92 cluster. Furthermore, this study is significant because it provides a model to investigate the cellular mechanisms responsible for alveolar and vascular endothelial simplification that occurs in traditional BPD models without the confounding free-radical damage caused by high oxygen exposure. The above outlined aims will be investigated in an environment with an established history of successful mentorship of junior faculty to independence. Under the supervision of an expert advisory committee, the applicant will 1) Advance her technical skills, with acquisition of as murine pulmonary function testing, immunohistochemistry, and next generation sequencing techniques; 2) Learn advanced biostatistics; and 3) Learn delivery mechanisms of targeted therapeutics. Future independent studies will likely focus on the developmental interplay between the alveoli and vascular endothelium, and use of the miR-17~92 cluster as a biomarker and/or therapeutic target for BPD."
"9449324","Cell migration is a critical feature of normal development and disease. For >25 years, we have been developing an in vivo model in which we combine sophisticated genetic and optogenetic manipulations with quantitative live imaging analyses to probe molecular mechanisms underlying collective cell migration: the border cells in the Drosophila ovary. When we began, we did not know a single gene that was required, and live imaging was impossible. Now many molecular pathways are known. We were the first to show that the small GTPase Rac controls protrusion and migration in vivo. We went on to use a photo-activatable form of Rac to show that activation in a single cell is sufficient to steer the entire cluster. Now Rac and its relatives Rho and Cdc42 are well known as key nodes in the signaling and cytoskeletal pathways that govern cell polarity and migration. Recently it has become clear that tumor cells disseminate in groups that resemble border cell clusters in several key aspects. So it is more relevant and interesting than ever to investigate the underlying mechanisms. Here we propose to continue our longstanding pattern of technical and conceptual innovation to address a key outstanding question. How do the molecular mechanisms of cell motility derived from studies of single cells migrating unobstructed on glass applies to the more diverse morphologies and behaviors of cells traveling in groups in vivo through 3D, cell-rich terrains. In cells migrating individually in vitro, mutually inhibitory interactions between Rac and Rho set up distinct protruding and contractile domains. It is unclear how this model applies to groups of cells moving in vivo. In Aim 1 we will address the following key open questions: In collectively moving cells, do Rac and Rho inhibit one another? Do they do so cell autonomously, non- cell-autonomously, or both? Is Rac only required in the lead cell for protrusion? Is Rho specifically required in following cells? Individually migrating cells can also switch from a Rac-dominated/protrusive mode of migration to a Rho-dominated, contractile mode. Do collectively moving cells exhibit comparable plasticity? In Aim 2, we propose to decipher the roles of apical/basal polarity complexes in collective chemotaxis. Individually migrating cells lack apical/basal polarity but collectively migrating cells require it. We propose to tease apart the autonomous and non-autonomous contributions of apical and basolateral protein complexes to the coordination of collective cell motility. Finally, in Aim 3 we propose to unify seemingly disparate observations into a common conceptual framework to test the hypothesis that multiple downstream effectors of Cdc42, all of which contribute to border cell migration, form an integrated network. These studies will lead to a more precise and comprehensive understanding of the intracellular signaling networks that provide cells with 3D coordinates. Our work will produce a paradigm for us to test in collaboration with our colleagues who study collective cell dissemination in metastasis."
"9384999","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Interleukin-7 (IL-7) is a cytokine with broad functionality in the immune system: it is critical for lymphocyte development and peripheral T cell survival. Recent evidence however indicates that polymorphisms in IL-7R? are associated with increased risk for various autoimmune diseases and blocking IL-7/IL-7R? interaction in mouse models of Type 1 Diabetes (T1D), Multiple Sclerosis, and Rheumatoid Arthritis has therapeutic benefit. Together, these studies strongly suggest that the IL-7/IL-7R? pathway plays a critical role in the development of autoimmunity. We found that IL-7R? blockade prevents and reverses autoimmune diabetes in non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice, which spontaneously develop a disease similar to human T1D. The main goal of this proposal is to understand the mechanisms underlying the role of IL-7/IL-7R? in the pathogenesis of T1D as a basis for developing novel immunotherapies targeting the IL-7 pathway. The central hypothesis is that IL-7 promotes T1D by enabling autoreactive CD4+ T cells to escape critical regulatory mechanisms, resulting in compromised tissue tolerance. Increased access to IL-7 due to production of the cytokine in the pancreas and altered IL-7 signaling in autoreactive T cells are potential mechanisms underlying IL-7-driven autoimmunity. Therefore, we will perform an in-depth analysis in NOD mice of IL-7 production at the autoimmune site, and of the role of IL-7 receptor signaling in effector/memory T cells and Tregs.  In Specific Aim 1, we will investigate how IL-7 counteracts inhibitory receptor expression induced in autoreactive CD4+ T cells exposed to persistent islet self-antigens. The role of IL- 7R? expression levels and distinct IL-7 signaling pathways in preventing regulation of islet- specific T cells in the pancreas will be determined using novel phosphoflow cytometry. In Specific Aim 2, we will investigate the role of IL-7R? expression in pancreatic Tregs, using a novel conditional knockout mouse model allowing specific deletion of IL-7R? in Foxp3+ Tregs. Impact on T1D development will be evaluated. In Specific Aim 3, we will characterize IL-7- producing cells in the pancreas during progressive autoimmune inflammation and we will identify the signals inducing pancreatic IL-7 expression, using novel IL-7/GFP knock-in reporter mice.  We have generated innovative mouse models to investigate how IL-7 drives autoimmune disease. Successful execution of the proposed experiments will provide critical knowledge to design novel strategies for therapeutic targeting of the IL-7/IL-7R? pathway in T1D and, perhaps, other autoimmune conditions."
"9378420","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recurrent oncogenic translocations involving Ig or TCR loci characterize human lymphoid malignancies. These translocations often derived from mis-repaired DNA double stand breaks (DSBs) generated during normal lymphocyte development. Availability of free DNA end, proper end-processing and the mis-joining of distal DNA ends form the three essential steps for chromosomal translocations. Developmental DSBs in lymphocytes are normally repaired by the non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) pathway with help from the alternative-end joining (A-EJ) pathway(s) that preferentially use micro-homology (MH) at the junctions. NHEJ is also responsible for end-processing, such as opening the hairpin ends at Ig/ TCR loci generated during V(D) recombination. Sequence analyses revealed that NHEJ and A-EJ also mediate the mis-repairs that generate translocations. Thus understanding the mechanism and regulation of NHEJ and A-EJ have broad implications in lymphomagenesis. DNA-PKcs is the catalytic subunit of the DNA-dependent protein-kinase (DNA-PK), a NHEJ factor and a PI3K related protein kinase. In the absence of DNA-PKcs, direct end-ligation is largely normal, but hairpin opening-a form of end-processing required for sealed hairpin ends before ligation, is completely blocked. Here we report that in a knockin mouse model expressing the kinase-dead (KD) form of DNA-PKcs alone (DNA-PKcsKD/KD), direct end-ligation is completely blocked, leading to embryonic lethality similar to core NHEJ deficient (e.g.Lig4-/- ) mice. Co-deletion of Ku70 that is necessary for the recruitment of DNA-PKcs to DNA, rescues the embryonic development of DNA-PKcsKD/KD mice, indicating that DNA-PKcs protein regulates end-ligation at DNA ends. Despite end-ligation defects, DNA-PKcsKD/KD cells open hairpin normally, but only in the presence of normal ATM kinase activity, revealing a previous unrecognized role of ATM in hairpin opening. Finally in contrast to frequent A-EJ mediated IgH-Myc translocations and aggressive lymphomas in other NHEJ/p53 double deficient mice, lymphomas are rare in DNA-PKcsKD/KDp53-/- mice despite the severe genomic instability, indicating potentially defects in A-EJ. DNA-PKcs is auto-phosphorylated and phosphorylated by ATM upon DSBs. Based on these findings, we hypothesize that DNA-PKcs phosphorylation regulates hairpin opening (Aim1), end-ligation (Aim 2) and A-EJ (Aim3) to suppress lymphomagenesis. Aim1 will address how redundant phosphorylation of DNA-PKcs and Artemis by ATM and DNA-PKcs promotes hairpin opening. Aim 2 proposes to test the hypothesis that autophosphorylation of DNA- PKcs at the DNA ends is necessary for ends-ligation by identifying functional relevant autophosphorylation sites on DNA-PKcs. Aim 3 will test the hypotheses that DNA-PKcs KD protein physically blocks end-resection and suppress A-EJ and oncogenic translocation by characterizing class switch recombination (mediated by A- EJ and NHEJ) and IgH-myc oncogenic translocations in DNA-PKcsKD/KD cells and mice. Together these studies will determine the role of DNA-PKcs phosphorylation in DNA repair and translocations. In the future, DNA- PKcs phosphorylation will provide an attractive target to regulate NHEJ and A-EJ for cancer treatments."
"9456378","Most of what we know about antifungal drug research is derived from studies of non-pathogenic model fungi, such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which can easily be inserted into high throughput screening platforms, but are unsuitable as pan-fungal models. The rapid completion of genome sequences, and continually evolving bioinformatic manipulation of this vast and growing amount of data, has enabled new approaches to antifungal investigation. Presently, clinical mycology is faced with a growing problem of drug resistant and multi drug resistant organisms, which is compounded by the lack of approved antifungals and difficulty of discovering and bringing new ones to the clinic. These issues combine to limit antifungal choices for clinicians. To address this issue, we will develop a method that rapidly interrogates the fungal genome to reveal genes and pathways that are potential antifungal targets. The major objective of this study will be to develop a way to rapidly and inexpensively identify these targets. To accomplish this goal we will work with an increasingly important yeast pathogen, Candida glabrata, and an insertional mutagenesis system based on the bacterial pathogen, Agrobacterium tumefaciens. The first aim will be to improve the existing Agrobacterium tumefaciens transformation efficiency to yield enough transformants to produce a saturated insertional mutagenesis map. We will next develop a capture-probe based enrichment method for recovering insertion site fragments from the predominating non-junctional genomic DNA background. Finally, we will apply deep sequencing to these enriched fragments to identify each insertion site and its neighboring flanking genomic DNA, and ultimately assemble a high density insertion map that will be used to identify genes that are essential for survival, and therefore, potential antifungal targets. Three maps will be prepared, one will be a control map from the wild type genomic strain, and two will be maps prepared from cells exposed to Fluconazole and Caspofungin, which will be compared to the wild type map to identify drug-specific genes and genes that are responsive to both drugs. The long term goals that will be possible after this study will be to rapidly identify the genes and pathways that are the targets of any antifungal lead candidate."
"9405362","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Back pain is among the top contributors to disability among Americans and is associated with considerable cost to the US economy. Despite established practice guidelines that recommend conservative approaches, clinical management of nonspecific back pain (i.e., back pain that is not caused by pathologic etiology) varies, with evidence of overuse of opioid analgesics, early diagnostic imaging, and specialty care. Older adults in particular receive poorer care for nonspecific back pain than their younger counterparts. While nonspecific back pain is one of the top reasons adults visit physicians, it also happens to be one of the most common conditions treated by complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) providers who rely on conservative management. In the US, the chiropractic profession is the largest and most organized CAM group, and chiropractic care is the only CAM service covered by Medicare. However, current information available to health policymakers lacks a fundamental understanding of the potential indirect effects of chiropractic care in Medicare. The overall objective of this project is to rigorously examine the relationship between availability of chiropractic care and utilization, expenditures, and care for nonspecific back pain. Our central hypothesis is that chiropractic care is being used as a substitute for ambulatory medical services and affects both expenditures and nonspecific back pain care. This research project has the following two aims: (1) Among older adults, determine the extent to which availability of chiropractic care influences use of and expenditures on ambulatory medical services (e.g., primary care, specialty care, and emergency room visits) for nonspecific back pain and (2) Among older adults, determine the extent to which availability of chiropractic care influences clinical management of nonspecific back pain. Our approach is innovative because it departs from the current status quo by performing a real-world, natural experiment using Medicare patients who relocated. As each patient serves as his or her own control, this rigorous study design is better suited to identify causal relationships and will allow us the unique opportunity to observe the effect of a change in chiropractic care availability. In order to measure availability of chiropractic care and other health services, we will apply novel geographic information system (GIS) tools. This proposed project is significant because it will provide timely information for health policymakers to anticipate effects of healthcare system redesign; specifically, how inclusion of a CAM service in a national health insurance system impacts care of older adults with nonspecific back pain."
"9391989","ABSTRACT ? Breast Cancer Program  The Breast Cancer Program (BC) was an outgrowth of the basic, translational, population and clinical research  of the LCCC Breast Cancer SPORE, which has been continuously funded since 1992. LCCC investment in  faculty and infrastructure supports one of the country's premier clinical and research breast programs,  performing important interdisciplinary research of the past decade with members rising to leadership positions.  This knitting together of clinical, basic, and epidemiologic research is the hallmark of the Breast Program, and  is reflected in the investment in faculty and resources fostered by including over $10M in genomics/sequencing  resources used for institutional as well as large multicenter trials and $7M in CBCS-III, which includes  comprehensive biologic, traditional and molecular epidemiology, as well as treatment data and outcomes. This  represents the largest and most heavily annotated population-based study ever performed addressing racial  disparities in breast cancer, behavior and outcome. Other investments include the rapidly expanding Geriatric  Oncology program, which has accrued over 2000 patients to molecular and functional geriatric studies.  BC members capitalize on their discovery and understanding of intrinsic breast cancer subtypes to further  characterize the distinguishing biological properties of breast cancer heterogeneity. Strategic goals include: 1)  population-based studies identifying novel associations with breast cancer risk and hospital-based studies of  alterations in normal breast and the breast tumor microenvironment, 2) bench-to-bedside approaches to  therapeutics leveraging murine models and human window trials, 3) translational discovery and applied  strategies including novel imaging and 4) correlative tissue biomarker studies nested within clinical trials.  This mature Program and SPORE infrastructure includes clinicians, imaging innovators, statisticians,  bioinformaticians, epidemiologists, and laboratory scientists utilizing the population and a range of models,  from genetically engineered mice to the patient on into translational and clinical research protocols. We rely on  novel approaches and applications in genomics, proteomics, imaging, informatics and clinical responses to  analyze subtype specific biology, detection, metastatic potential and therapeutic efficacy. We perform clinical  trials using novel therapeutic regimens, trial designs and biomarkers and we participate and analyze  genomically some of the world's largest breast cancer trials. BC has substantial inter-programmatic  interactions due to the LCCC's long term interest in North Carolina's minority disparities, following the  program's seminal discoveries of the high incidence of TNBC in younger African Americans and surprising  finding that the largest survival disparity is in women with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer.  BC consists of 21 members from 3 different schools and clinicians from 5 specialties. Since 2010, program  members have published 503 cancer-related articles (46% collaborative). In 2014, BC members held 53 grants  and $10.1M (total cost) in annual extramural funding, including 21 grants and $5.5M (total costs) from the NCI."
"9446484","Islet transplantation (ITX) is experiencing increasing clinical success, but its applicability for type 1 diabetes (T1D) is currently limited by the need for lifelong chronic immunosuppression (IS) and the high number of islets from deceased organ donors needed to reverse T1D. Islet encapsulation is a possibility to reduce or eliminate chronic IS, but, so far, traditional 1000 µm fixed-diameter capsules implanted in the peritoneal cavity failed to provide sufficiently effective and long-lasting outcomes. Most likely, this is because large and avascular capsules limit nutrient transport and delay glucose-stimulated insulin release (GSIR) causing loss of graft functionality. Recently, we developed an encapsulation technology that allows ?wrapping? each individual islet with a uniformly thin (»15 µm) layer of biomaterial, generating capsules that ?conform? to the size and shape of the islet rather than enclosing them in fixed-diameter traditional capsules. By reducing the diffusion distance 10-fold, this conformal coating (CC) allows increased nutrient transport. By reducing the overall graft volume more than 100-fold (from ~500 to ~3 mL), CC also makes possible transplantation in well vascularized confined sites, including pre-vascularized devices, and is no longer limited to the intraperitoneal cavity, further maximizing nutrient transport. Contrary to islets in traditional microcapsules, CC islets display no delay in GSIR, and our computational model predicts that CC grafts placed in confined sites will provide physiological insulin release (GSIR) after revascularization. We were able to confirm long-term euglycemia after transplantation of fully MHC-mismatched CC grafts in diabetic mice without immunosuppression. To address another main shortcoming of current ITX protocols, we recently found that our CC platform is also suitable for use with essentially unlimited insulin-secreting cell sources derived from stem cells (SC-b). Accordingly, we hypothesize that our unique CC technology can allow long-term function of primary islets and SC-b cell grafts without the need for immunosuppression using clinically applicable coating hydrogels (aim 1). Further, we hypothesize that by using innovative nanomaterials, we can provide local immunomodulation and higher oxygen tension at the CC graft site in the immediate post-transplant period minimizing the number of cells needed to reverse T1D and maximizing long-term graft function (aim 2). The work in preclinical mouse models proposed here is needed before we can test our base and nanomaterial-refined CC platform in primates and then in humans."
"9430676","Project Summary / Abstract This proposal aims to develop the applicant into an independent physician-scientist in the field of diabetes and metabolism. The principal investigator Dr. Jing Hughes has undergone PhD training in the basic biological sciences and completed clinical training in internal medicine and the endocrinology subspecialty. The proposed 5-year career development plan will build on Dr. Hughes's experiences in endocrinology and provide her with further expertise in the design and conduct of basic diabetes research. Dr. Hughes's long-term goal is to establish an independent laboratory dedicated to studying islet biology, with a goal to discover new endocrine and paracrine pathways modulating islet hormone secretion. The central guidance and training environment for this project will be provided by the mentor, Dr. David W. Piston, who is the Chair of Cell Biology at Washington University, also a recognized leader in islet physiology and imaging expert. Dr. Piston has an excellent track record for training physician-scientists, especially at the incipient stages of their careers. In addition to Dr. Piston's mentoring, Dr. Hughes will be able to take advantage of the rich resources available at Washington University, including scientific as well as career guidance from her faculty advisory committee and collaborators. The research set forth herein seeks to address how brown fat restores glucose balance by modulating glucagon secretion in diabetic animals. In the past few years, the Piston laboratory has revolutionized thinking about islet physiology by demonstrating new and unexpected roles in diabetes modulation by alpha cell hormones. We now examine the mechanism by which factors secreted by brown adipose tissue act on alpha cells to regulate glucagon production, a phenomenon that has never before been investigated. Dr. Hughes will use a proteomics strategy to identify the brown adipose factor and test the hypothesis that its effect on glucagon suppression is mediated through GPCRs on islet cells. The proposed studies have the potential to provide proof-of-principle for novel translational treatments and reduce suffering from diabetes. This K08 mentored research award will provide the necessary resources for Dr. Hughes to complete these studies and to develop the necessary intellectual foundation and skill set as an independent diabetes investigator."
"9406981","Project Summary  Dopamine (DA) has been involved in the production of locomotor behaviors throughout evolutionary time. Multiple DA populations in the brain and the spinal cord have been implicated in this process, however several DA populations remain unstudied. Here, we investigate a population of hypothalamic DA neurons that we have recently shown to be critically involved in the production of locomotor behaviors in zebrafish. These neurons are genetically defined by expression of tyrosine hydroxylase-2 (th2). We have shown that ablation of these neurons grossly reduces locomotion and that optogenetic activation increases it. However, the precise nature of the behaviors that are affected by the th2+ neurons is not well understood. To understand how these neurons modulate locomotor behavior, we must know where they send their projections, how their activity modulates those downstream targets, and the precise nature of the behaviors that result from that modulation. The first aim of the proposed work is to identify downstream targets both anatomically and functionally.. The second aim is to precisely identify locomotor patterns regulated by th2+ neurons. This will provide a detailed understanding of the output of the network. These experiments will identify previously unknown mechanisms by which hypothalamic DA neurons modulate locomotor behaviors."
"9446810","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Oregon Health & Science University and the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center have worked over the past decade to develop ex vivo drug profiling to guide a rationale decision-making in assigning drugs to cancer patients, thereby improving patient outcomes and reducing healthcare costs. A number of recent breakthroughs, many developed through our partnership, have dramatically improved on nearly all aspects of ex vivo drug testing. Our work to date has led to numerous compassionate-use cases as well as new investigator initiated clinical trials. Recognizing the broad utility for a clinic-friendly ex vivo drug sensitivity platform, we set up a commercial entity, SEngine Precision Medicine, whose mission is to provide functional testing of patient derived tumor cells for research, clinical studies, and drug development. Here we seek to move beyond proof of concept in the assay toward wider adoption by cancer research centers, community hospitals, and individual users. We will benchmark the assay?s predictive performance in both ?N of 1? settings and in prospective observational studies, and use this baseline performance to drive the development of methods to further improve its predictive value. We will continue to optimize drug selection by integrating ex vivo drug testing with patient specific genomic profiling and clinical data. In parallel, we will develop a reporting system, based upon requirements analysis, for potential end users such as clinicians and academic research centers. OHSU will provide expertise in precision medicine for AML, functional testing of primary leukemia cells, and clinical trials and will assist with assay optimization. FHCRC will provide expertise in functional testing of cells derived from solid tumors, focusing first on breast cancer, cancer genomics, and clinical trials; and will assist with assay optimization and benchmarking. SEngine will develop CLIA certified assays, optimize sample analysis workflows, and develop a reporting system for end users. All three sites will work together to demonstrate inter-institutional proficiency of the assays. At least five additional academic centers have agreed to provide patient derived tumor cells for this project and we anticipate this number will increase during the granting period. The partnering institutions will also provide essential feedback for our performance and reporting system. Our end goals for this project are to produce a refined functional genomic platform based on ex vivo drug screens, a user-friendly reporting interface, and adoption of the technology in the clinical care decision-making process."
