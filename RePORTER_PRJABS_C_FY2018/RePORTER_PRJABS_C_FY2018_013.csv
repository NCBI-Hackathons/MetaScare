"9535711","Project Summary  The Abramson Cancer Center (ACC) has a well-established internal, Institutional, and external Planning and  Evaluation (P&E) process that engages leaders, members, and advisors from multiple disciplines, perspectives  and levels. The goal of this process is to guide future directions, set priorities and prioritize investments of the  Center while, at the same time, providing ongoing mechanisms to monitor, assess and adjust research  progress, Programs, Shared Resources, allocations, and strategies. This cohesive process is supported by  highly integrated and effective bodies, such as the Senior Leaders, Executive Committee, Program Leaders,  Shared Resource Advisory Committees, and the External Scientific Advisory Board (ESAB), which provides  critical advice and feedback from experts. The Planning and Evaluation process has resulted in changes in  Program focus, development of new Cores, changes in clinical research operations, and prioritization of  Developmental Funds. Complementing these efforts are Programmatic, Divisional and Center-wide research  seminars, meetings and retreats that foster new interactions and collaborations with Penn colleagues and  external experts. Strategic planning is embedded in the ACC and Penn culture. The ACC plan of 2008-2013  set forth the goals for this period, including accelerating the translation of basic science discoveries into  investigator-initiated clinical trials, establishing a comprehensive molecular profiling and personalized medicine  initiative, enhancing behavioral interventions to reduce cancer risk, and promoting translation of ACC research.  Soon after his appointment, the Center Director, Dr. Dang, defined his vision through 2020, and charged a  group to recommend strategies to realize the Center's goals in translational research and precision medicine.  A defining accomplishment has been $20M from the Institution to establish innovative transdisciplinary  programmatic efforts in translational cancer research, which are fueled by multi-year Institutional grants and  resources in high priority areas. Rigorous internal review of Programs, Shared Resources, Developmental  Funds, and strategic plan reviews by the ESAB ensure that the ACC continues to strive for excellence and  adheres to NCI guidelines. The ACC responds to all ESAB recommendations and then reports on its actions.  Taken together, the integrated P&E processes have successfully guided the growth and development of the  ACC during the project period."
"9404362","Project Summary/Abstract: Clinical Pharmacology (CP)  The Clinical Pharmacology (CP) Shared Resource is now in its 19th year of operation and primarily functions  to support Norris Cotton Cancer Center (NCCC) investigators in the design, performance, data analysis, and  interpretation of pharmacology objectives in preclinical (in vivo and ex-vivo), clinical, chemoprevention, and  epidemiological studies, at lowest cost and highest value as possible. The major CPSR services are in 4  domains: (1) Central processing for biological fluids and tissues (e.g., cells, tumor tissue, plasma, saliva, urine,  DNA) obtained as part of approved clinical and epidemiological protocols; services that include, but are not  limited to, sample logging, processing (including processing peripheral blood mononuclear cells), aliquoting,  storage and sample distribution when necessary; (2a) Development of novel analyte assays (when such  assays are only available as research methods) using either high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)  with ultra-violet (UV) and/or fluorescence detection, or increasingly liquid-chromatography mass spectrometry  (LC-MS/MS) methodology; (2b) Performance of analyte-concentration measurements in biological fluids and  tissues for preclinical and clinical oncology studies using these validated bioanalytical assays; (3a) Expert  consultation regarding study design and pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic hypothesis-development and  testing in preclinical and clinical cancer studies; (3b) Pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) data  analysis and PK-PD modeling from pre-clinical and clinical studies; and (4) Research pharmacy services for  cancer therapeutic clinical studies with both commercially available drugs and drugs under an investigational  new drug application (IND). CP is directed by Dr. Lionel D. Lewis, who has established expertise in the clinical  performance, the pharmacokinetics, and the pharmacodynamics of early phase clinical studies of  investigational oncology drug/drug combinations. Other staff include a junior faculty pharmacologist with  bioanalytical and molecular pharmacology expertise, a research assistant-lab manager with biorepository and  bioanalytical expertise, and a research pharmacist with expertise in oncologic and investigational drug  pharmacy. During the period 12/01/2012 to 11/30/2013, members of the Molecular Therapeutics (MT)  program were the most common and frequent users of CP services, representing 60% of use. However, CP  provided important services to other NCCC program members.

"9549538","We analyzed the largest clinical experience to date with Anthrax Immune Globulin Intravenous (AIG-IV) from an outbreak of Bacillus anthracis soft tissue infection in injection drug users and compared findings from 15 AIG-IV recipients versus 28 non-recipients. Overall, mortality rates did not differ comparing recipients vs. non-recipients (33.3% vs. 21.4% respectively, p=0.47). However, whereas only 8 of 30 patients (26.7%) with a low risk of death admission sequential organ failure assessment score (SOFA) of 0 to 5 received AIG-IV (p=0.01compared to a proportion of 50%), 7 of the 13 patients (53.9%) with a high risk of death (SOFA of 6 to 11) received treatment (p=0.78). Overall, AIG-IV recipients had surgery more often and, among survivors, longer hospital stays (all p0.05). Overall, AIG-IV recipients were sicker than non-recipients in this outbreak. This difference and the small number of higher risk patients, confound assessment of AIG-IVs effectiveness in the outbreak."
"9549536","This muli-center U01 grant study was funded by the Division for AIDS, National Institutes of Health in January 2015 at which time the study underwent scientific review and regulatory review.  We filed and received an Investigational New Drug (IND) exemption from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the use of the combination sofosbuvir and ledipasvir (SOF/LDV).  The protocol underwent IRB review at all enrolling sites.  The clinical trials agreement was with the sponsor (Gilead) and UCSF and was completed in April 2016.  Updated site agreements with all enrolling sites was completed in November 2016.  The NIH site has undergone IRB Review, initial site monitoring review and received site activation.  We currently have drug on site.  There have been a number of barriers to accrual for this study: 1) Harvoni became FDA approved 2) By 2016, it became easier to obtain insurance authorization for Harvoni 3) Most previously potential candidates for the study have already been treated 4) Standard of care treatment with Harvoni (off study) doesnt require many visits to the primary provided for bloodwork, whereas this study required many study visits, requires travel to NIH CC for some patients, and requires collection of research samples.  The Grant is to end 12/31/2017 and we have requested and received approval for a no-cost extension with a new end data of 12/31/2018.  This extension requires many changes to the current protocol, including: 1) Changing referring centers to enrolling centers 2) Changing NIH to a collaborative site (no longer enrolling subjects) 3) Adding a retrospective arm to the study"

The laboratory is working to improve the manufacture of Bone Marrow Stromal Cells (BMSCs) and induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells for regenerative medicine applications.  In addition, the laboratory is developing antigen-specific T cells to treat viral infections in immune suppressed patients.    Dendritic cells are an important adjuvant for cancer vaccines. The Cell Processing Laboratory is currently producing DCs expressing HER2/neu to treat cancer patients whose tumors express this antigen. The lab has discovered that factors in the plasma from some people can inhibit the expression of HER2/neu by DCs.    The cell processing laboratory has developed and is manufacturing several CAR T cell therapies. CAR T cells expressing CD19, CD19-CAR T cells, are being manufactured in order to treat pediatric patients with B cell leukemia.  Manufacturing of CD19-CAR T cells using a humanized CD19 antibody has recently been initiated. These CAR T cells are being used to treat adults with B cell lymphomas.  The laboratory has also developed anti-B Cell Maturation Antigen (BCMA) to treat patients with multiple myeloma, anti-CD22 CAR T cells to treat patient with CD19-negative B cell leukemia and anti-CD30 CAR T cells to treat Hodgkin's lymphoma.  The laboratory has recently begun to develop procedures to manufacture CAR T cells using an automated instrument.    Human Papillomavirus (HPV) infection is associated with a number of cancers. The laboratory has developed a method to produce T cells that express a T cell receptor (TCR) that is specific for the HPV-16 oncoprotein E7.

A protocol to treat patients with progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy(PML) using BK-specific viral T cells has been developed and patients are being treated."
"9549532","Pulmonary arterial hypertension is a rare disorder associated with poor survival.  Endothelial dysfunction resulting from 1) genetic susceptibility, and 2) a triggering stimulus that initiates pulmonary vascular injury, the two-hit hypothesis, appears to play a central role both in the pathogenesis and progression of PAH.  Inflammation appears to drive this dysfunctional endothelial phenotype, propagating cycles of injury and repair in genetically susceptible patients with IPAH and DaPAH.  Therapy targeting pulmonary vascular inflammation to interrupt cycles of injury and repair and thereby delay or prevent right ventricular (RV) failure and death have not been tested.  Spironolactone, a mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) and androgen receptor antagonist, has been shown to improve endothelial function and reduce inflammation.  Current management of patients with severe PAH and NYHA class IV symptoms includes use of MR antagonists for their diuretic and natriuretic effects, late in the course, once clinical right heart failure has developed. Currently, no well described data exists from randomized clinical trials examining the safety and efficacy of MR antagonist therapy in early stages of PAH.  In this randomized, double blinded, placebo-controlled spironolactone treatment study, subjects with IPAH and DaPAH undergo 1) standard clinical examinations including 6-minute walk distance and echocardiography; 2) cardiopulmonary exercise testing; 3) plasma profiling of inflammatory markers; 4) gene expression profiling of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs); and 5) high-resolution MRI-based determination of pulmonary vascular and RV structure and function.  Safety and tolerability of spironolactone in PAH is assessed with periodic monitoring for hyperkalemia and renal insufficiency as well as the incidence of drug discontinuation for untoward effects. We hypothesize that initiating therapy with spironolactone at an earlier stage of disease in subjects with PAH could provide additional benefits through anti-inflammatory effects and improvements in pulmonary artery endothelial function.  The concept for the protocol received an NIH Bench-to-Bedside Award in 2011 and a formal protocol was initially approved by the NHLBI IRB in September 2012. Subsequently IRB approval was sought and obtained at collaborating sites and various amendments were brought into alignment at all institutions by summer 2013. In 2013 -15 we established at the NIH a clinical research PAH program consisting of a multidisciplinary medical staff with expertise in cardiology, pulmonary, and critical care as well as a regulatory and research nursing support staff with extensive experience in assuring compliance with clinical protocols while maintaining the highest standards of clinical care.   During the 2016-17 reporting period we entered into a collaboration with the Center for Human Immunology (CHI). We will provide CHI with samples that they will process for markers of inflammation, and whole blood gene expression studies in order to expand our ability to immunophenotype subjects with PAH. We also entered into a collaboration with the Laboratory of Transplantation Genomics (LTG) of the NHLBI to do exploratory studies using cell-free DNA based tools to evaluate the pathogenesis of and injury related to PAH.  Referrals are currently being received from multiple sites. To date (August 2017) of the 40 pulmonary arterial hypertension subjects enrolled in our Natural History protocol (13-CC-0012)  nineteen have been enrolled in this study (Spironolactone Randomized Interventional Trial).  This randomized controlled trial is double blinded and open for recruitment. New Recruitment Efforts in the reporting period 2016-2017 include the following:   1) Received approval from the Office of Communications and Media Relations and the NHLBI IRB to develop a web page on the NIH web site highlighting our NIH PAH program.  The web page was developed and went live during this reporting period.  2) Coordinating presentations for PH support groups on a continual rotating basis in PA, MD, DC, and VA.  During this reporting period attended support groups in Philadelphia, PA; Baltimore, MD; and the District of Columbia.  3) Participated in a meet the expert panel discussion for PH patients at ATS 2017.  4) In collaboration with the Pulmonary Hypertension Association, hosted a symposium entitled Challenges in Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension: Breathing, Beating, and Beyond at the National Library of Medicine on May 19, 2017.  Developing for distribution a smaller snapshot index information card describing essential details of the protocol and containing a quick reference bar code to the NIH, CCMD, PAH website."
"9549550","Co-resistance necessitating use of less effective or relatively toxic reserve antibiotics (aminoglycosides, tigecycline and colistin/polymyxin B) may worsen survival. We investigated difficult-to-treat resistance (DTR) in gram-negative bloodstream infections (GNBSIs) defined by absence of susceptibility to all first-line agents (carbapenems, beta-lactams and fluoroquinolones (FQ) using a large clinical database of US hospitals. We found that survival in antimicrobial-resistant GNBSI is highly contingent on presence of active first-line option(s); DTR limits treatment options to reserve agents, including aminoglycosides, which are far from universally active. DTR remained infrequent (1%) among GNBSI, but occurred at half of the hospitals examined and across all US regions. This work has been presented at the Annual Meeting for the Infectious Diseases Society of America, in New Orleans, LA in October 2016. A manuscript on this work is being submitted for consideration at an infectious diseases journal."
"9471688","Project Summary:  Usher Syndrome (USH), the most common genetic cause of deaf-blindness, is an incurable syndrome that results in deafness, vestibular dysfunction, and retinal degeneration leading to blindness (retinitis pigmentosa, RP). It affects 20% of infants with bilateral moderate to profound congenital sensorineural hearing loss, 15-30% of patients with RP and 50% of deaf-blind children. There are12 genes encoding for proteins essential for the proper development, maturation and survival of sensory hair cells in the cochlea and photoreceptors in the retina. USH gene mutations cause dysfunction of the entire protein network, resulting in deafness, blindness and vestibular dysfunction.  We request support for the Second International Symposium on Usher Syndrome that will bring together scientists, clinicians and USH patients and families to: 1) Promote research in emerging areas of USH diagnosis, prevention, treatment, and cure; 2) Present new research findings and develop future research strategies; (3) Promote collaboration among researchers and clinicians from different institutions and different research focus areas who study USH; (4) Educate patients/families affected by Usher Syndrome about research advances and promote collaboration between these families and USH researchers; 5) Make researchers and clinicians aware of the needs of USH patients and families to direct new research priorities.  The Second International Symposium on Usher Syndrome will be held in conjunction with the 10th Usher Syndrome Family Conference in Mainz, Germany, July 19-21, 2018. The International Usher Syndrome Symposium will convene 200-225 scientists and clinicians and 100-125 families. Days one and two will feature a scientific program that will include presentations and discussions related to genetics and diagnostics, cellular and molecular aspects of the proteins affected in the disease, animal models of Usher syndrome and advancement in research on therapies for the retinal degeneration and hearing loss. The third day will be a Family day and it will include presentations that will summarize the scientific symposium for the general audience and discuss diagnosis, cellular and molecular biology of Usher syndrome, gene therapy and clinical trials.  The Symposium will support the mission of NIDCD and NEI by focusing on uncovering and sharing new knowledge of a syndrome that affects hearing, balance and vision, and results in significant communication impairments. The Symposium will support the public health and educational missions of the NIH by including scientists, clinicians and patients/families with USH to encourage collaboration on both a formal and informal basis for all participants."
"9527350","PROPOSAL SUMMARY/ABSTRACT: Allergic diseases are characterized by the local tissue infiltration of unique inflammatory leukocytes that are often dominated by eosinophils. These infiltrating eosinophils are currently perceived as a single monolithic population, although recent studies suggest that unique eosinophil subtypes that potentially display distinct activities co-exist. Unfortunately, efforts to stratify eosinophils into functionally distinct groups have thus far proven to be difficult and time consuming, leaving the role of individual cells largely unknown. This proposal integrates growing definitions of eosinophil subtype-specific gene expression with a novel multi-RNA targeting approach, allowing single cell gene expression imaging within tissue biopsies by reiterative cycles of in situ hybridization. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that the immune polarization of tissue infiltrating eosinophils is disease specific, characteristic of ongoing local immune responses, and an indicator of disease activity. The immediate objective is to demonstrate the utility of this strategic in situ approach as a way to identify and image individual eosinophils within an available tissue biopsy or cell cytospin preparation. Strategically, these studies will initially use eosinophils and established mouse models of disease with which we have previously reported mechanistic studies exploring the role of eosinophils in these settings. Our intermediate goal is to translate these techniques into identifying eosinophil subtypes and their location in eosinophilic diseases with established immune characteristics. The long term goal is to translate this strategic approach to human subjects for identification of eosinophil subtypes in biopsies. The objectives will be accomplished by the completion of the following Specific Aims: (1) To define and standardize identification of eosinophil subtypes using our novel multi-biomolecule cleavable fluorescent probes for in situ single cell imaging of multiple mRNAs and/or proteins in cells and tissues. Our immediate objective will be to utilize our characterization of eosinophil-specific gene expression and the use of novel reiterative in situ hybridization strategies to image functionally distinct immune polarized eosinophil subtypes via a ?signature? pattern of gene expression; (2) To identify the immune polarized eosinophil subtypes resident in tissues linked with established mouse models of Th2 and Th1 human disease, including pulmonary and gastrointestinal diseases. The presence and location of eosinophil subtypes within tissues reflects a diversity of immune microenvironments in health and disease and, in turn, the importance of novel eosinophil-mediated activities. It is noteworthy that as part of these studies we will also define the distribution and location of eosinophil subtypes resident in healthy tissue. (3) To determine the utility of multiple-target in situ technologies to image human eosinophil subtypes using tissue sections/cell preparations from patients with Th2 and Th1 diseases characterized by eosinophilia.. This aim is expected to provide a proof-of-concept foundation that will be the base for future in situ stratification of leukocytes as markers of diagnostic and disease activity."
"9549444","In the present study, we first developed an isolated perfused rat kidney model to examine the direct effects of ET and LT on renal function. This model allows investigation of the toxins' renal effects independent of their potential influence on systemic hemodynamic function. The model will permit measures of the effects of ET and LT on glomerular filtration rate; tubular function including sodium and glucose excretion as well as reabsorption, concentration and acidification; and interstitial changes.   In studies completed we have shown that ET, rather than stimulating renal tubular sodium losses as we originally hypothesized, actually promotes free water uptake and to a lesser degree sodium uptake. Immunohistochemistry studies and urine analysis show ET mediates these renal effects via up regulation of aquaporin 2 in the tubular membrane. This increase in free water uptake with ET provides one basis for the reduced sodium levels noted in patients with severe anthrax infection and may also contribute to the marked extravascular fluid collections patients develop.  Work from this study was presented at the 2015 International Conference of the American Thoracic Society and a manuscript has been submitted and is presently under review."
"9535729","Project Summary  The Radiobiology and Imaging Program has been continuously approved by the NCI Cancer Center Support  Grant since 1987. The Program seeks to improve patient outcomes through the advanced understanding of  how ionizing and non-ionizing radiation interacts with cancer and normal tissues. The Programmatic goals are  to: (1) Study molecular mechanisms of radiation response and identify targets to improve radiotherapy. (2)  Elucidate mechanisms underlying use of Photodynamic Therapy (PDT) and translate to the clinic. (3) Develop  methods for measuring and altering tumor oxygenation and metabolic status; understand the molecular  events governing cell death by IR and physiological stresses. (4) Develop novel techniques to image the  interaction between radiation, PDT and tissues. (5) Understand the biological effects of protons to inform their  effective clinical use. The Program was rated as ?Exceptional? at the time of the 2010 CCSG renewal  application and is led by Constantinos Koumenis, PhD, Professor and Director of the Research Division of  Radiation Oncology and Amit Maity, MD, PhD, Professor of Radiation Oncology. Drs. Maity and Koumenis are  NCI-funded researchers who bring their scientific vision to this Program, which is focused on basic and  translational research and the development of investigator-initiated trials. Since the last renewal, the Co-  Leaders have recruited new junior and senior scientists, enhanced collaborative peer-reviewed funding and  increased the number of investigator-initiated clinical trials involving radiotherapy and imaging. Moreover, Drs.  Koumenis and Maity have steered the Program towards new areas of emphasis including combined radiation  and immunotherapy modalities and precision medicine and they have expanded the incorporation of imaging  modalities into basic and translational efforts. Through this process, they increased interactions with the  Immunobiology, Cancer Therapeutics, Breast Cancer and Cancer Control Programs. A major development  has been the substantial expansion of both translational and clinical studies of proton therapy. Program  members represent six departments from four schools at Penn. During the past five years, translational  research has continued to be a major focus. The 33 Program members have $7.7M in research grant funding  (annual direct costs), of which $7.5M is peer-reviewed and $3.7M is NCI-funded. There were a total of 405  cancer-related publications authored by Program members during the project period. Of these, 19% are intra-  Programmatic, 28% are inter-Programmatic and 53% are multi-institutional.      "
"9432234","A high salt diet is an established cause of hypertension and cardiovascular morbidity. However, recent work has shown that Na+ is stored, predominantly in tissues such as the skin, and that this storage both drives and is driven by inflammation. This discovery has exposed a fundamental gap in our understanding: we do not understand the relationship between salt, inflammation, and blood pressure in humans. It is important to fill this gap because many inflammatory diseases remain poorly controlled and are associated with hypertension and increased cardiovascular risk. The rationale for the research proposed is: 1) Na+ is stored in the skin; 2) skin Na+ concentrations can be measured by 23Na magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and are induced by excess salt intake and associated with elevated blood pressure; 3) skin Na+ concentrations boost pro-inflammatory immune cell responses that have beneficial effects protecting against skin infection but also have potentially detrimental pro-inflammatory systemic effects; 4) a high dietary salt intake is pro-inflammatory and exacerbates autoimmune disease and arthritis in animal models. A critical knowledge gap is that the effects of dietary salt intake and tissue Na+ on inflammation and blood pressure in humans in the setting of inflammation is not known. Our overarching hypothesis is that, in the setting of inflammation, high dietary salt intake affects regulation of both blood pressure and inflammation adversely and does so through accumulation of skin Na+. Accordingly, we propose to study patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) as a model of chronic inflammation. RA is a prototypical, common autoimmune inflammatory disease that is associated not only with musculoskeletal consequences but also with increased hypertension and cardiovascular mortality. We will determine: Aim 1) if skin Na+ measured by 23Na MRI is higher in patients with active RA than in patients with well-controlled RA and controls; and Aim 2) if a low Na+ diet in patients with RA decreases skin Na+ concentrations and improves inflammation and blood pressure. These studies will define the relationship between dietary Na+ intake, tissue Na+ concentrations, inflammation, and blood pressure and will use a clinical intervention (reduced salt diet) in patients to break the self-sustaining cycle between inflammation?tissue Na+ and vascular dysfunction. The studies are innovative by moving from basic to clinical research to for the first time: 1) use 23Na MRI to determine the vascular effects of tissue Na+ in humans in the setting of inflammation; 2) define the effect of modified salt intake on autoimmune inflammatory disease in humans. The studies proposed have high potential impact since manipulation of dietary salt intake or tissue Na+ concentrations have the potential to improve inflammatory autoimmune diseases as well as their cardiovascular complications in millions of people."
"9472494","Abstract The Serine/Threonine kinase Akt plays a critical role in multiple cellular processes including proliferation, cell metabolism and survival, through phosphorylation of nuclear and cytoplasmic targets. In CD4 T helper (Th) differentiation inhibition of Akt and/or mTOR activity results in the induction of T regulatory (Treg) cells, which are critical for the maintenance of self-tolerance and the prevention of autoimmunity. Treg induction through exposure of naïve CD4 T cells to low antigen (Ag) doses is negatively correlated with activity of the Akt/mTOR pathway. The effect of Ag dose on Th differentiation has been shown in several in vivo models such that low Ag dose favors Treg and Th2 differentiation whereas high Ag doses induces inflammatory Th1 cells. Our preliminary data show that TCR signals of high vs. low strength result in qualitatively different Akt phosphorylation, resulting in a change in the substrate specificity of Akt. Quantitative mass spectrometry analysis of immunoprecipitates (IPs) with an anti-phospho-(Ser/Thr) Akt substrate antibody revealed multiple differences between Akt substrates phosphorylated in T cells activated with low or high dose Ag. Intriguingly, we observed that several RNA processing factors are differentially phosphorylated by Akt depending on Ag dose. In particular, hnRNP L, which regulates the alternative splicing of key components of the TCR signaling pathway is phosphorylated in T cells stimulated with low, but not high, dose Ag. This results in Akt-dependent changes in the alternative splicing of TCR signaling components. These results suggest that different levels of TCR stimulation initiate qualitatively distinct differentiation programs and that differential regulation of alternative splicing by Akt is one of the key elements determining Th cell fate decisions. Based on these preliminary findings, we hypothesize Akt-mediated phosphorylation of RNA processing factors induces the differentiation of naïve Th cells to either effector or regulatory cells through changes in alternative splicing of TCR signaling components. Three specific aims are proposed; 1) To determine how TCR signal strength controls Akt activity and function; 2) To determine the role of Akt phosphorylation in controlling alternative splicing in developing Teff and Treg cells; and 3) To determine the role of alternative splicing of CD247 in Th cell fate."
"9549467","The goal of this protocol is to explore changes to microbial communities during the course of hospital care, and to determine the extent to which these alterations affect whether hospitalized patients become colonized with nosocomial bacteria. The study enables collection of clinical specimens and associated medical data to evaluate the natural history, epidemiology, and genomics of patients who are expected to be hospitalized for at least seven days. Biological specimens including blood, stool, sputum, and swabs will be taken from CC inpatients at least 2 years of age as frequently as daily through discharge, and at follow-up visits for up to 2 years from the date of enrollment. To understand the dynamics of the fecal and other microbiota of hospitalized patients, this protocol will assess the full complement of the microbial-host-environmental contributions including: (1) microbial genome and community; (2) patients genotype, underlying medical condition, medical treatment; and (3) hospital practices and environment.  This protocol has enrolled 15 patients thus far, all meeting high-risk criteria for colonization with multidrug-resistant organisms. The protocol will continue with a focus on epidemiologically significant multidrug-resistant bacteria and yeasts."
"9455054","Parasitic flatworms of the genus Schistosoma cause schistosomiasis, a neglected tropical disease affecting hundreds of millions of people worldwide. There is no vaccine, and only a single drug (praziquantel; PZQ) available for treatment and control. Although PZQ was introduced decades ago, its mode of action is still not completely understood. However, one major effect of PZQ is to disrupt the tegument of the worm, likely resulting in exposure of parasite antigens that are normally hidden from the host. The effectiveness of PZQ drops significantly in immunocompromised mice, and it has been suggested that host antibodies act directly against parasite antigens that become exposed on the worm surface as a result of this PZQ-induced tegumental disruption. We have been using RNAseq to investigate transcriptomic changes that occur in schistosomes following administration of PZQ to S. mansoni-infected mice. We find that in response to low-dose PZQ (100 mg/kg), adult worms of each of 3 different S. mansoni strains dramatically increase expression (up to ~150-fold) of MEG-3 transcripts. MEG-3 is one of a group of micro-exon genes (MEG) found within the S. mansoni genome. MEGs have the potential to generate high levels of protein variation through alternative splicing of short, symmetric exons organized in tandem. Most of these proteins appear to be secreted by the worm, and others have postulated that expression of such a complex pool of variant MEG proteins could constitute a schistosome immune evasion mechanism. We hypothesize that in response to PZQ-dependent immune attack, schistosomes activate immune evasion/decoy mechanisms, one of which is increased expression of MEG-3 proteins (and associated transcripts). This exploratory project will test predictions of this hypothesis. We will compare expression of MEG-3 transcripts following low-dose PZQ in worms in contact with an intact immune system versus those in contact with a defective immune system (eg, infecting immunocompromised mice). We will also test whether other antischistosomal drugs that do not require an intact host immune system for activity do not induce upregulation of MEGs, and we will determine whether reconstitution of the immune system of an infected immunocompromised host with serum from schistosome-infected immune-intact mice can restore the PZQ-induced upregulation of MEG-3. These studies will lay the groundwork for a future R01 proposal that will examine the role of adaptive schistosome defenses in parasite drug susceptibility and long-term survival. This work could ultimately lead to novel therapeutic strategies for targeting parasite immune evasion mechanisms as a means to increase drug susceptibility or disrupt the schistosome life cycle."
"9607140",". PROJECT SUMMARY (See instructions); The Drug Discovery and Structural Biology Core (DDSB) is a new shared resource that supports the identification and development of small molecule and macromolecular therapeutics for the basic, translational and clinical scientists at COHCCC. The overarching goal of DDSB is to provide the necessary scientific resources to assist In chemical biology studies and development of molecularly-based therapeutics. DDSB comprises several scientific disciplines that include medicinal chemistry, biopolymer synthesis, high throughput screening, and X-ray crystallography. Rather than have separate cores for each, these disciplines are consolidated under one unit for maximum efficiency in drug development. This has resulted in unique shared resource that works in concert to achieve the basic and translational research goals of the Cancer Center. Specific areas of expertise and services provided include: synthetic organic chemistry, custom synthesis of specialized RNA and DNA, assay development, high-throughput screening, protein production, biophysical characterization and structural biology. The amalgamation of these services provides a seamless drug discovery pipeline for development of novel molecular targets. The DDSB core is focused yet flexible to allow Cancer Center members to use any one of these services individually or in combination. An additional significant component of the DDSB is to consult with Pis, develop reagents and assays, and obtain preliminary results to support the application of externally funded proposals by Cancer Center members. For example, the DDSB has developed COH29, a novel small-molecule inhibitor that is a dual PARP/rlbonucleotide reductase antagonist and has promising activity against BRCA1 deficient cancers. This work has led to new ROI funding and our first drug candidate for GMP synthesis and clinical trials developed completely in-house. Collectively, the DDSB serves as a scientific and intellectual hub for Integrating diverse disciplines such as molecular modeling, bioinformatics, and pharmacology in a transdisciplinary approach towards the development of new agents for the treatment of cancer. The DDSB Is unique in this capacity as it provides a complete program of scientific services and coordination of efforts for drug discovery in an academic setting. Thus, Pis can leverage the DDSB core for pursuing avenues of research not previously available at one site in an academic center, thereby accelerating the development of chemical biology probes and molecularly-targeted therapies for clinic trials at COHCCC."

"9535701","Project Summary The Transgenic and Chimeric Mouse Facility has been continuously funded by the NCI CCSG since 1989. Drs. Stephen Liebhaber and Nancy Cooke, Professors of Genetics and Medicine, have provided leadership as Co- Directors to this Shared Resource since 1993. Both individuals are experienced investigators with considerable expertise in transgenic and chimeric mouse generation and analysis, and mammalian gene targeting. An experienced technical team led by Dr. Jean Richa provides expertise in a range of transgenic technologies, enabling the facility to regularly introduce new and improved services. Among the services provided by the Transgenic and Chimeric Mouse Facility are: generation of transgenic mice via microinjections of DNA into fertilized oocyte; generation of chimeric mice via injection of embryonic stem cells into blastocysts; direct genome editing (Zn finger, TALEN, and CRISPR/Cas9) by microinjection of RNA and DNA into fertilized embryos; embryo re-derivation; embryo and sperm cryopreservation; in vitro fertilization; centralized and monitored cryopreservation storage; and maintenance of generally useful mouse lines including those for recombination-activation gene expression. The facility uses state-of-the-art laser conditioning of the zona to facilitate IVF and has intracytoplasmic sperm injection capability on-line to complement the in vitro fertilization service. Newly developed services during the current funding period include the major expansion of cryopreservation services with corresponding expansion of the centralized and dedicated cryopreservation facility, integration of mouse ES microinjection service with a centralized gene knock-out core facility, and direct genome editing by Zn-finger, TALEN and CRISPR-Cas9 technologies. In the reporting period (10/01/13- 09/30/14), Cancer Center members accounted for 46% of total Facility users and those with peer-reviewed funding accounted for 42%. This compares favorably with our request for 21% of the total budget from the CCSG. Additional Institutional support is provided in the form of funding for equipment maintenance and facility infrastructure upgrades and maintenance."
"9535721","Project Summary  The Cancer Therapeutics Program has been continuously approved by the NCI CCSG since 1993. The  Program seeks to improve patient outcomes through the rapid development of novel research ideas which are  translatable to the clinical arena and ideally can be individualized to disease and patient-specific settings. The  Programmatic goals are as follows: 1) Bring forward novel preclinical breakthroughs from the bench to the  bedside and bring relevant cancer therapeutics from the clinic to the lab in order to enhance the mechanistic  understanding of cancer therapeutics; 2) Take new drugs from first-in-human Phase I trials to disease-specific  clinical trials that will have a significant impact on establishing new standards of care; and 3) Develop  pharmacodynamic and predictive markers to select the best drugs for the patients most likely to respond.  These goals are applied across four research themes: targeted therapies, combinations to overcome  resistance, immunotherapy, and predictive and pharmacodynamic biomarkers. This Program, which was rated  as ?Excellent? at the time of the prior CCSG renewal application, is led by Program Co-Leaders Drs. Ravi  Amaravadi and Naomi Haas, who were jointly appointed in September 2013. They succeed Drs. Peter  O'Dwyer and Corey Langer, who were asked to become leaders of new cross-Programmatic translational  research Initiatives in pancreatic and lung cancer, respectively. The new Co-Leaders were chosen because  they have complementary skill sets that match the future directions of the Program. Dr. Amaravadi has  expertise in the preclinical-to-translational space, and Dr. Haas has expertise in taking Phase I studies into  disease-specific studies and developing multi-institution clinical trials. Drs. Amaravadi and Haas are NCI-  funded researchers who bring their scientific vision, innovativeness and energy to this Program, which includes  an emphasis on basic and translational research. The 25 Program members represent 10 departments in the  Perelman School of Medicine. During the current project period, translational research has continued to be a  major focus. Members currently have $6.7M in annual research grant funding (direct costs), of which $3.6M is  peer-reviewed and $2.4M is NCI-funded. There have been a total of 361 cancer-related publications authored  by Program members during the project period. Of these, 12% are intra-Programmatic, 39% are inter-  Programmatic and 57% are multi-institutional."
"9353193","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Endothelial cells are the primary components of capillaries, which are present in nearly every tissue of the body and are essential for efficient delivery of oxygen and nutrients to metabolically active tissues. Within capillaries, the function of endothelial cells (ECs) is regulated in part by pericytes, specialized perivascular cells that regulate vessel permeability, stability, and remodeling. One of the primary signaling pathways responsible for pericyte- EC interactions is the angiopoietin-1 (Ang-1)/ Tie2 pathway. Pericytes produce Ang-1, which binds to the Tie2 tyrosine kinase receptor expressed by nearby endothelial cells and promotes EC remodeling, inhibits EC apoptosis, decreases EC layer permeability, and promotes the integrity of EC monolayers. Recent research has identified pericyte loss or dysfunction as a key contributor to the progression of many diseases such as cancer, Alzheimer?s disease, and diabetic retinopathy. Though many studies have used in vivo mouse models to elucidate the role of pericyte loss in capillary dysfunction and disease progression, in vivo models often lack the desired experimental control and rely heavily on non-human cells. To overcome these challenges, we propose to analyze the role of pericyte-EC interactions in stabilizing EC function using human cells in a highly controlled in vitro vascular model. Using 3D fibrin gels containing EC-lined channels and pericytes throughout the bulk of the gel, we will assess how pericytes alter EC function on both a macroscopic and single-cell scale. Then, to mimic the pericyte loss that occurs during diabetic retinopathy, we will selectively induce apoptosis in pericytes using the herpes simplex virus-1 thymidine kinase (HsvTK) system. By transducing pericytes with the ?suicide gene? HsvTK we can selectively induce apoptosis in pericytes by adding the drug Ganciclovir. We will assess EC function by measuring diffusion across the EC layer, expression of cell-cell junctions, basement membrane formation, and EC survival, sprouting, and migration. Finally, we will assess the ability of exogenous Ang-1 to restore stable EC function following pericyte loss. We hypothesize that pericyte loss will induce increased permeability of the EC layer, decrease expression of cell-cell junctions, and decrease EC survival and proliferation. Additionally, we expect that exogenous Ang-1 will encourage a stable EC phenotype following low levels of pericyte loss. This project will help us understand the role of pericyte loss in the progression of diseases such as cancer, Alzheimer?s disease, and diabetic retinopathy. Using a highly controlled in vitro model we can better elucidate the molecular events contributing to disease progression and test potential therapeutic targets for these diseases in a highly controlled environment using human cells."
"9535725","Project Summary  The Cancer Control Program is one of two Population Science Research Programs of the Abramson Cancer  Center (ACC).The transdisciplinary program composed of 27 members who focus on the identification of the  genetic, behavioral and health care determinants of cancer susceptibility and the development and  implementation of strategies to lower risk and improve outcomes. The Program is directly concerned with  improving cancer outcomes in the ACC's catchment area and working inter-Programmatically with all Research  Programs to apply advances in science to the health of populations. The members of the Program seek to  improve population health across the cancer spectrum through advancing science in the areas of: 1) Risk  Assessment; 2) Survivorship; 3) Communication and Health Behavior; and 4) Health Outcomes. The Program  has produced a substantial body of high impact work in the current project period. In the area of Risk  Assessment, members have led multiple groundbreaking studies which established the basis for clinical  management of women with BRCA1/2 mutations, identified risk loci associated with susceptibility to testicular  germ cell tumor and established genetic and genomic predictors of response to therapy in melanoma. In the  area of Survivorship, members have set clinical paradigms for cancer survivors through establishing care plans  and demonstrating that exercise programs improve outcomes. In the area of Communication and Health  Behavior, members are national leaders in health messaging and behavioral economics, with innovative  studies on use of incentives for improving health behaviors. In the area of Health Outcomes, members lead  critically important multidisciplinary studies on how research advances are translated into clinical practice and  address health care disparities within the ACC catchment area. The Program recruited 13 members in the  project period, with particularly important recruits in the area of ethical, legal and social implications of genetic  testing (Dr. Joffe), health communication and brain activity (Dr. Falk) and population-based cancer prevention  (Dr. Doubeni). The Program works closely with the Tobacco Environmental and Carcinogenesis Program to  create a robust population science initiative with widespread inter- and intra-Programmatic collaborative efforts.  Members of the Program come from nine departments within the Perelman School of Medicine, the School of  Nursing, the Wharton School of Business, and the Annenberg School of Communication. Exemplifying the  robust collaborative nature of the research environment, there have been 544 cancer-related publications over  the project period. Of these, 13% are intra-Programmatic, 37% are inter-Programmatic and 78% are multi-  institutional. Further demonstrating the substantive productivity of these collaborations, members have $11.5M  in annual cancer-related research grant funding (annual direct costs), of which $9.9M is peer-reviewed and  $5.3M is NCI-funded."
"9535717","Project Summary  The Tumor Virology Program serves as the central forum for facilitating interactions among virologists involved  in cancer-related research, and investigators with an interest in the etiological basis of cancer. Program  members have broad expertise in the biology of tumor viruses, including EBV, KSHV, alpha and beta  herpesvirus, HPV, HCV, HIV and other retroviruses, as well as emerging viral agents including Merkel cell  polyoma viruses and other recently identified gamma-herpesviruses. The Program facilitates research in  thematic areas through highly interactive and productive affinity groups in Viral Oncogenesis, DNA Virology,  and Viral Receptors and Retrovirology. Since 2002, the Program has been led by Erle Robertson, PhD; in  2012, David Weiner, PhD, a pioneer in translational medicine and vaccine development, became Program Co-  Leader. Both Co-Leaders are experienced, well-funded and highly collaborative in their leadership and  research activities. During the project period, important strides have been made to further develop the  Program, which include fostering a stronger focus on translational research, developing new intra- and inter-  Programmatic collaborative efforts, recruiting additional tumor virologists, and better member engagement  through Program meetings as well as interdisciplinary, inter-Programmatic retreats. In doing so, the Tumor  Virology Program has nucleated interest among basic and clinical investigators in studying the roles of viruses  in cancer with collaborating members from the Tumor Biology, Immunobiology, Cancer Control, Cancer  Therapeutics, and Radiobiology and Imaging Programs. The major aims of the Program are to: 1) Understand  the mechanisms mediating cellular transformation, immortalization and cell cycle dysregulation by viral  encoded proteins; 2) Understand the viral-receptor interactions and the structure/function of viral receptors; 3)  Understand the molecular biology and pathogenesis of retroviruses as they relate to AIDS and AIDS-related  malignancies; 4) Develop viral vectors for human cancer gene therapy; and 5) Develop vaccine strategies for  treatment of viral-associated cancers. The Tumor Virology Program consists of 22 members from five  departments and two schools. Two new members have been added to the Program in the last five years,  increasing its breadth and strength. Program members have $10.2M in cancer-related grant funding (annual  direct costs), of which $6.9M is peer-reviewed and positioned to support cancer-related studies. $1.8M is  directly NCI-funded. During the project period, members published 176 cancer-related papers, of which 10%  were intra-Programmatic, 13% were inter-Programmatic and 51% were multi-institutional."
"9549514","Our work in this area has three broad areas of focus: (1) Development of rapid nanopore-based strategies to sequence bacterial resistance plasmids with clinical diagnostic applications; (2) Use of these sequencing strategies to characterize genomic mechanisms of antimicrobial resistance in clinical isolates, and their emergence; (3) Application of RNA-seq to study gene expression from resistance plasmids.  These areas of focus seek both to evaluate sequencing methods that can be used practically in a clinical microbiology lab and to study the biology of plasmid-based mechanisms underlying antimicrobial resistance.  (1) Nanopore sequencing methods provide ultrafast, read-by-read data availability that may be used to support real-time infectious disease diagnostics, including rapid sequencing of bacterial isolates and resistance gene identification in the clinical microbiology lab.  Work done during the current fiscal year developed a practical nanopore sequencing workflow that takes as input purified plasmid DNA and can produce full annotations of all plasmid-based resistance genes within a working day, starting with subcultured isolates (manuscript submitted).  Current work is in progress to extend these methods to allow sequencing of resistance plasmids from single bacterial colonies from primary cultures.  (2) The evolution of pathogenic MDR phenotypes in the natural in vivo context of acute and chronic infection is being studied through genomic analysis of serially-collected human clinical bacterial isolates.  Four initial isolate collections have been assembled along with with comprehensive microbiologic characterization, with a focus on evolution of MDR phenotypes in pathogenic non-fermenting gram negative proteobacteria (Pseudomonas, Burkholderia, Achromobacter, and Bordetella).  Work done during this fiscal year demonstrated the role that hypermutation may play in facilitating the emergence of resistance to ceftazidime-avibactam in P. aeruginosa (Khil et al, ASM 2017; manuscript in preparation).  Work in the next fiscal year will examine pathoadaptation and emergence of resistance phenotypes in Bordetella, Achromobacter and Burkholderia.  (3) Global gene expression analysis using NGS technology (RNA-seq) offers a powerful approach to study the large-scale structure of transcription and transcriptional regulation.  In these experiments, we are employing strand-specific methods to study gene expression from resistance plasmids from clinical bacterial isolates.  Both context-dependence of expression and regulatory antisense RNA is being studied with this technique.  In particular, we are investigating the consequences of large scale insertion-sequence mediated rearrangements in plasmids that have occurred in vivo, studied previously with bioinformatics approaches in He et al, 2016.  Work done during the past and current fiscal year has produced rich RNA-seq data sets from plasmids from a number of clinical isolates, currently under analysis."

"9549483","During this past year DC PFAP has made substantial progress in the following areas  1.  The DC Cohort database has over 9000 patients enrolled.  The program is enrolling at all sites.  Data analysts are looking at merged data. This database is providing unique, real time granularity for the city HIV population.  The data is meshed with the DC Department of Health database to enhance its utility for analyzing the city epidemic. Abstracts and manuscripts are in progress.  2.  The prevention protocols have exceeded expectations in terms of enrolling African American men and women in studies to assess their risk behavior.  Based on superior enrollment and retention of subjects, the DC investigators have been invited to participate In PREP studies have been completed with DC sites being among the leaders in enrollment and retention in follow up.  3. All studies performed are investigator-initiated studies, which recruited almost exclusively among the citys underserved populations. Studies completed in the past three years have included unique studies of various combination regimens in HIV infected and uninfected patients. The program has focused on science-based studies looking at mechanisms of action and correlates of response in tissue and in blood.  Also completed was an ambitious study to determine whether primary care providers could deliver DAA therapy safely and effectively. This sudy has been presented at major meetings and has engendered a high level of interest since it suggests that the pool of providers capable of treating HCV could be much larger than subspecialists alone. This study will be submitted for publication in the fourth quarter of 2017  4. The program has established new relationships with clinics that serve clients who are sex workers, who have illegal substance use issues and who have sexually transmitted diseases. New studies entitled GRAVITY, CEASE and ANCHOR will explore methods to identify incident cases and newly recognized prevalent cases. The goal is to design a Getting to Zero strategy for the District of Columbia.   This project is fulfilling all of its missions ahead of schedule. The program is working effectively with the DC Center for AIDS Research and with community and academic partners to build a strong AIDS research network in DC."
"9549516","Previously, we demonstrated that by combining ferumoxytol (F) with protamine (P) and heparin (H) resulted in a self assembling nanocomplex that could be used to label cells. Transmission electron microscopy of HPF revealed that these nanocomplexes were spheroid shaped with the HP in center surrounded by F. Incubating stem cells and T-cells in HFP nanocomplexes in serum free media for 2 hours followed by complete media resulted in cell labeling. HPF labeling did not impair the cells viability, proliferative capacity, apoptotic rate, activation, phenotypic surface marker expression, or capacity to differentiate. MRI at 3T of HPF labeled BMSC implanted in the rat brain demonstrated the ability to detect 1000 cells with a 50% decrease in T2* in the rat brain compared to the surrounding parenchyma. Pre-clinical safety/toxicity studies of intracerebrally administrated HPF-labeled NSCs in mice were also performed, and demonstrated no significant clinical or behavioral changes, no neuronal or systemic toxicities, and no abnormal accumulation of iron in the liver or spleen. The HPF labeling technique has been scaled up, and the NIH Cell Processing Section cGMP facility was able to label BMSCs in biofactories with no changes in BMSC function or viability of the labeled cryopreserved cell product. The HPF method was also used to label genetically engineered neural stem cells (NSC) that express cytosine deaminase as part of an ongoing clinical trial to treat patients with recurrent glioblastoma.  The HPF labeled NSC are to be directly implanted deep into brain around the periphery of the surgical resection sight in order that they can migrate to areas of residual tumors or satellite metastasis.   MRI monitored the migration of the HPF labeled NSC in the brain over 30 days. Initial studies performed at City of Hope report that there was essential no adverse events following the implantation of labeled cells.   We have recently optimized the HPF labeling approach by changing the order that the three drugs are added to cells to FHP resulted in significant increase in the intracellular iron content in BMSC and NSC as compared to HPF labeled cells.  We also report on the physicochemical characteristics for optimizing the H, P, and F components in different ratios, and mixing sequences, producing NCs that varied in hydrodynamic size. NC size depended on the order in which drugs were mixed in media. Electron microscopy of HPF or FHP showed that F was located on the surface of spheroidal shaped HP complexes. Human stem cells incubated with FHP NCs resulted in a significantly greater iron concentration per cell compared to that found in HPF NCs with the same concentration of F. These results indicate that FHP could be useful for labeling stem cells in translational studies in the clinic.  Long-term neurological deficits due to immature cortical development are emerging as a major challenge in congenital heart disease (CHD). By injection superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles into the lateral ventricles of hypoxic exposed of the gyrencephalic piglet brain a model of CHD we were able to label neural stem cells in vivo and track their pattern of distribution into the cortex and olfactory bulbs by ex vivo MRI.  The results showed that hypoxia reduces proliferation and neurogenesis in the subventricular zone (SVZ), which is accompanied by reduced cortical growth. The findings demonstrated that SVZ neuronal stem cells (NSC) contribute to perinatal corticogenesis and suggest that restoration of SVZ NSCs' neurogenic potential is a candidate therapeutic target for improving cortical growth in CHD."
"9606591","Drawing upon our successful track record of designing and implementing innovations in human/patient-centered tools, systems, and experiences for some of the nation?s leading healthcare organizations, we will design a   strategic communications plan that speaks directly to patients and people in different healthcare and caregiver roles, using a compelling visual identity and language they can connect with and relate to. This will allow more people to meaningfully engage with PMI as a whole, thus increasing enrollment and retention in the initiative.  What makes Wondros unique is our adherence to the principles of human-centered storytelling. In our experience, thoughtful, well-designed, and effective communications are based on the authentic needs of stakeholders. Our approach to this campaign would be based on an understanding of the authentic needs, goals, and desires of the people who will make up the PMI Cohort. We develop this understanding through an initial process of discovery   we call Ecology Modeling (more details on this are presented under ?Our Approach?). This will lay the foundation for establishing a national PMI community that will grow and gain momentum based on grassroots advocacy.  As your communications design partner and in close collaboration with NIH Communications, we will develop a comprehensive communications plan to drive enrollment on a national scale, to reach the goal of achieving a research cohort of one million Americans and beyond. The plan would include outreach and dissemination to key organizations and groups, including underserved and underrepresented populations, website promotion, earned/social media inclusive of multimedia assets, and a paid advertising campaign in English and Spanish. The plan would be anchored by strategic and targeted messaging and a unique and compelling visual identity.  To reach the broadest and most diverse audiences, the campaign will have a robust web and mobile presence. The campaign will also leverage the latest innovations in targeted online marketing to reach specific, traditionally  Hard-to-reach communities. We will measure success and impact consistently through digital analytics and metrics.  The campaign would include advocate-celebrities and influencers to communicate the higher purpose of PMI: democratizing and supporting science and research for the benefit of all and for future generations, making healthcare more transparent and human-centered, and emphasizing the engagement of the public as active partners in the advancement of precision medicine. The campaign will convey the importance of PMI as part of the bigger picture for advancing medical science and, more specifically, how it can benefit and empower individuals as active participants in improved healthcare outcomes and processes.  We also understand the challenges of running all the different dimensions of a successful campaign and have the expertise needed to design and implement all the moving parts in a way that is flexible and responsive to changing conditions. We also understand the importance of working as a collaborative partner and ensuring that the plan has continuity throughout its lifespan."
"9562828","HUMAN SUBJECT RESEARCH   Rationale for Subject Selection The total number of subjects and different categories--gender, ethnicity, race, and age--continue to depend on the prevalence within the patient population availability at the Clinical Center. This protocol is a retrospective study with existing data; therefore, no new patients have been or will be recruited, and no additional imaging procedures will be performed.   Risk/Benefits Analysis There is no risk to these subjects because this protocol consists of reviewing radiologic studies that have already been obtained under another IRB protocol. The potential benefit to patients is that the improved diagnosis of infectious disease will lead to advanced and earlier detection of a pathogen, leading to more prompt and effective treatment. This study is not designed to provide any direct benefits to the subjects.   Consent and Documentation There is no consent form for this protocol since this study is analyzing retrospective data. Data is extracted from the CRIS, PACS, and RIS systems at an aggregate level, not at the study level. No documentation is or will be entered into the patient's medical record.   ANNUAL SUMMARY   The widespread prevalence and potential lethality of infectious diseases like tuberculosis, bronchiectasis, and abnormal airway enlargement pose potentially significant public health threats, and it raises the importance of needing prompt and specific diagnosis for these diseases worldwide.  Diagnostic imaging--CT, MRI, nuclear medicine, ultrasound, and/or radiographic images such as mammography in an unmasked form--can possibly play a significant role in early diagnosis and in characterizing severity that can lead to morbidity and mortality.   Since imaging of infectious diseases has historically been relatively nonspecific in identifying the precise pathogen, our hypothesis for this study continues to be defining imaging analysis techniques that will provide consistent qualitative visual analysis and consistent computer-aided quantitative analysis when evaluating infectious disease diagnostic studies. These new methods we are developing will soon determine if a specific methodology can increase the specificity of infectious disease imaging by using retrospective data in order to improve the prognostic value of radiology when assessing clinical severity and when enhancing the measurement of response to therapy.   Since the fall of 2011, our research team retrospectively reviewed a data base of thousands of radiologic imaging studies after patients were imaged for known infections. Many of these imaging studies were categorized, examined, and analyzed by the lab staff for the identification of specific visual and quantitative imaging features to improve the accuracy of infectious disease imaging, ultimately stepping closer to a more defined patient diagnosis. Our aims were to (1) statistically evaluate all data and compare all imaging findings associated with infectious diseases, and to (2) continue to develop software algorithms that will accurately detect, quantify, and characterize infectious diseases for all diagnostic imaging studies. Using state-of-the-art computerized techniques such as graph theory algorithms and deep convolutional neural networks, we are now able to automatically and accurately evaluate imaging patterns related to various diseases."
"9472479","PROJECT SUMMARY-ABSTRACT In new data presented in this proposal, we show that nerve driven, adrenergic stress signaling via the ?-adrenergic receptors (?-ARs) inhibits responsiveness to checkpoint inhibitor therapy in two different transplantable tumor models. By reducing ?-AR signaling using three separate approaches, (including through the use of a warmer room temperature, pharmacological antagonists of ?-ARs, and ?-AR knock out mice), we observed a significant remodeling of the immune microenvironment of tumors. From a tumor microenvironment (TME) largely devoid of CD8+ T cells, the TME became T cell rich, with an enhanced ratio of activated CD8+ cells to Treg cells, a change we associated with the improved sensitivity to anti-PD-1 checkpoint therapy. Other new, mechanistic data reveals that ?-AR signaling suppresses metabolic reprogramming required for optimal T cell activation. These, and other novel data, raise the provocative hypothesis that reducing adrenergic signaling in the TME (by repurposing safe and well- studied ?-blockers) could significantly increase the overall response rate of patients to immunotherapy. To rigorously expand these data to additional tumor models and to identify the mechanistic pathways involved, this revised proposal outlines a comprehensive set of experiments that will provide an in depth understanding of how adrenergic stress signaling significantly and broadly affects baseline immunity, and ultimately, the response to immunotherapy. Three interactive aims are proposed: Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that adrenergic stress signaling influences tumor formation or progression in autochthonous tumor models induced by either carcinogen or genetic manipulation wherein the host and tumor evolve together over a prolonged period of time. These experiments offer the unique opportunity to investigate the equilibrium phase of the interaction between host immune cells and tumor cells. Using these models, we will also test whether ?-blockers can improve the efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors. In Aim 2, we will define how adrenergic stress influences the immune contexture of the TME. Aim 3 arises from our new mechanistic data showing that adrenergic signaling inhibits the bioenergetic changes required for both CD8+ T cell activation and effector function. Since metabolic reprogramming is required for an optimal T cell-mediated anti-tumor immune response, reducing adrenergic stress could provide a novel mechanism underlying the broad effects of adrenergic stress signaling seen in our studies. Impact: These data highlight the potential of adrenergic stress signaling to regulate the immune status of the tumor microenvironment and support the strategic repurposing use of clinically available ?-blockers in patients to improve responses to immunotherapy."
"9549429","Nitric oxide (NO):  NO production by endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS; NOS-3) is cytoprotective and regulates smooth muscle tone, leukocyte adhesion, and platelet aggregation. In contrast, inducible NOS (iNOS; NOS-2) during sepsis produces large amounts of NO resulting in shock, myocardial depression, tissue injury and apoptosis. This duality underlies the paradox that both under and over production of NO are associated with vascular dysfunction. Our work has focused on cGMP-independent, non-canonical NO signaling and inflammatory gene regulation.  NO was shown to up-regulate TNFa production (J Immunol 1994; Blood 1997) through a cGMP-independent signaling pathway (J Biol Chem 1997) that utilized NO-responsive Sp1 promoter binding sites (J Biol Chem 1999; J Biol Chem 2003).  Dysfunctional eNOS was found to upregulate TNFa (J Biol Chem 2000) through the release of ROS that activated ERK1/2 (Am J Physiol 2001).  NO activation of p38 MAPK stabilized IL-8 mRNA (J Infect Dis 1998) through AU-rich elements in the IL-8 3 UTR (J Leuk Biol 2004).  Additional mechanisms involving ERK1/2 and CU-rich elements in other target transcripts demonstrated the diversity of NO effects on transcript stability and translation (Nucleic Acids Research 2006; J Leuk Biol 2008).  Sickle cell disease was shown to cause oxidant and inflammatory stress in the vasculature (Blood, 2004). Circulatory stress in sickle cell disease was associated with gene expression changes and arginine metabolism abnormalities (Circulation, 2007).  Anti-proliferative effects of NO were linked to p38 MAPK activation and p21 mRNA stabilization with subsequent down-regulation of polo-like kinase 1 through a CDE/CHR proximal promoter site (BMC Genomics 2005; J Biol Chem 2006).  Both NO and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) protect the endothelium and regulate its function. PPARg was activated by NO through a p38 MAPK dependent signal transduction pathway (FASEB J 2007).  In contrast to the pro-inflammatory effects of high output NO, CO was found to block proximal events in NF-kB signal transduction and broadly suppress inflammation (PLoS One 2009).  Nuclear receptors: Nuclear receptors (NRs) regulate cardiovascular homeostasis, metabolism and the immune system. Glucocorticoid (GC) activation of GR is used extensively to treat inflammation. In addition to inducing anti-inflammatory mediators, GR suppresses inflammatory responses by tethering to DNA-bound NF-kB and AP-1 complexes, transcription factor families that broadly control the expression of cytokines, chemokines and adhesion molecules. This trans-repression mechanism has also been described for some of the other 47 human NRs. We are specifically investigating the regulatory effects of PPARg, MR, AR, and COUP-TF on inflammation in human endothelium.  Rosiglitazone (RGZ) is a PPARg ligand/agonist used to treat type 2 diabetes. G-protein coupled receptor 40 (GPR40)/p38 MAPK/ PGC1a/EP300 activation by RGZ was shown in human endothelial cells (ECs) to markedly augment downstream RGZ/PPARg genomic signaling (J Biol Chem 2015). Thus, RGZ effects on human endothelium is best understood as a cognate two-receptor system, integrated by p38 MAPK, PGC1a, and EP300 (Pharm Research 2016).  In human ECs, MR agonists were found to repress NF-kB mediated gene transcription. In contrast, MR was found to trans-activate inflammatory AP-1 signaling in a DNA sequence, MR conformation, and AP-1 family member dependent fashion (J Biol Chem 2016). Aldosterone/MR activation of AP-1 may contribute to harmful inflammatory effects in CHF and PAH.  Long-chain monounsaturated fatty acids (LCMUFA; i.e., C20:1 and C22:1) have been shown to attenuate atherosclerosis development in mouse models. These benefits were associated with the activation of Ppar signaling pathways, possibly via the activation of GPR40, and favorable alterations in the proteome of lipoproteins (Atheroscelerosis 2017).  MR-independent anti-inflammatory effects of spironolactone have been observed for decades, but the mechanism has been elusive. Spironolactone, but not eplerenone was found to suppress both NF-kB and AP-1 inflammatory signaling independent of MR. Spironolactone-induced proteasomal degradation of XPB was identified as the mechanism of this potent anti-inflammatory effect (submitted).  Pulmonary arterial hypertension pathogenesis and therapeutic targets: Two PAH clinical protocols, including a pilot study of spironolactone therapy (Trials 2013) and a natural history study investigating circulating markers of vascular inflammation and high-resolution cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), provide a source of patient specimens to support ongoing laboratory studies.  Circulating ECs (CECs) have been proposed as a biomarker of vascular injury. CECs were identified by flow cytometry and their endothelial phenotype was validated using ultramicro analytical immunochemistry (Thrombosis and Haemostasis 2014).  Gene expression differences in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of patients with PAH compared to healthy gender, age and ethnicity matched volunteers identified alterations in inflammation, cell adhesion, cell motility, the cytoskeleton and apoptosis (American Thoracic Society abstract 2011). Specific genes and pathways overlapped with previously proposed mechanisms of PAH such as Ras, RhoA, integrin, focal adhesion kinase-1 (FAK), and p21-activated kinase (PAK). A meta-analysis was performed of PAH/PBMC expression profiling studies from multiple centers and across various expression profiling platforms (ATS abstract 2016; manuscript in preparation).  The in vitro profiling of ECs with heterogeneous PAH-associated molecular defects, such as those involving BMPR2, CAV1 and SMAD9 are being studied to create a comprehensive picture of pathogenic mechanisms and therapeutic targets. The comparative biology of seemingly unrelated molecular defects may lead to both individualized and possibly universal approaches for arresting or even reversing pathologic vascular remodeling.  Heterozygous loss-of-function mutations in bone morphogenetic protein type II receptor (BMPR2) are the most common genetic cause of PAH. Furthermore, BMPR2 expression is markedly reduced in end-stage PAH, even in patients not harboring these mutations. BMPR2 knockdown (KD) in human pulmonary artery ECs (PAECs) activated Ras/Raf/ERK signaling, an important oncogenic pathway, leading to proliferation, invasiveness and cytoskeletal abnormalities. Therapeutics targeting this non-canonical may be useful in preventing or reversing vascular remodeling in patients with PAH (Am J Physiol Lung Cell Mol Physiol 2016).  Caveolin-1 (CAV1) loss-of-function (LOF) was found, similar to BMPR2, to produce a proliferative, hyper-migratory and inflammatory PAEC phenotype (Grover Conference 2015) with activation of JAK/STAT/interferon signaling (in preparation). Notably, interferon administration and CANDLE syndrome, an interferon-driven auto-inflammatory disease, have both been associated with the development of PAH. Dermal fibroblasts from PAH patients with CAV1 mutations displayed this same abnormal cellular phenotype (ATS abstract 2017).  Preliminary work examining SMAD9 LOF in human PAECs has demonstrated an abnormal cellular phenotype closely related to BMPR2 silencing. Notably, all three in vitro models, BMPR2, CAV1 and SMAD9, all show universal AKT activation. AKT activation is therefore being explored as a possible therapeutic target to block pathologic vascular remodeling across heterogeneous PAH-associated genotypes.  Serial cardiac MRI in the Su-5416/hypoxia/normoxia rat model of PAH demonstrated significant right ventricular dysfunction at week 5, providing a useful measure to follow disease progression and therapeutic responses (ATS abstract 2017)."
"9429510","ABSTRACT The developmental stage of the brain at the stroke onset plays key role in injury. Inflammation is a hallmark of perinatal brain injury, both early injury and repair. Previous therapeutic efforts were mostly focused on protecting neurons acutely, but such strategies appeared to be short-range. Very few studies focused on the development of agents that target cerebrovascular interface. Our long-term goal is to identify effective and safe therapy for perinatal stroke and facilitate translation into clinical practice. Emerging evidence in human infants has suggested that n3-Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids (n3-PUFA, i.e., Omega-3 fatty acids and derivatives/metabolites) play an important role in both normal postnatal brain development and in injured newborn brain. In rodents, n3-PUFA are shown protective in adult stroke, in juvenile brain after infection and in neonatal brain after neonatal hypoxia-ischemia, affecting an array of individual inflammatory mechanisms and vascular effects. We propose to identify whether n3-PUFA exert beneficial effects after perinatal stroke by a central mechanism¬?by attenuating sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P)/S1P receptor 2 (S1PR2)- mediated signaling at the immune-neurovascular axis and reorganizing lipid signaling. Enhanced mechanistic understanding of n3-PUFA-mediated effects in reducing injury and/or facilitating brain repair in newborns who suffer perinatal stroke would allow for almost immediate changes in management of injured newborns to enhance their brain development and long-term motor and cognitive outcomes. Demonstration that S1P/S1PR2 signaling is the target n3-PUFA will lead to identification of new therapeutic targets for perinatal stroke. We will test the central hypothesis that n3-PUFA enhance brain repair after perinatal stroke by modifying S1P/S1PR2 signaling at the immune-neurovascular axis. In Aim 1, we will determine effects of dietary n3-PUFA in attenuating neuroinflammation and vascular inflammation after perinatal focal arterial stroke or infection, and in microvessels isolated from acutely injured neonatal brain in mice with intact or disrupted S1PR2 signaling. In Aim 2, we will examine long-term effects of dietary n3-PUFA, and of altered brain lipid composition, on brain repair, brain connectivity and functional outcomes after perinatal focal arterial stroke. In Aim 3, we will examine short-term and long-term effects of post-stroke pharmacologic S1PR2 inhibition and n3-PUFA administration on vascular remodeling, brain connectivity and improved functional performance. We will use a novel clinically relevant perinatal focal arterial stroke model that we invented, in conjunction with loss-of-function and gain-of function genetic and pharmacological approaches and advanced non- invasive imaging methodologies, to understand how to target immune-neurovascular axis to enhance brain repair after perinatal stroke. Novel approaches to examine vascular inflammation and create atlas of the remodeling vasculature and of vessel-microglial interactions in vivo over time, together with brain connectivity measures, will enhance the understanding of brain repair in the disease."
"9562825","Although the primary aim of diagnosing and treating musculoskeletal impairments is to restore functional three-dimensional (3D) movements, the majority of the quantitative diagnostic and evaluation tools available to the clinician have remained static and two dimensional. Thus, the current focus is to develop and ultimately validate a combined set of tools that will enable the accurate and precise measurement, analysis and visualization of 3D static and dynamic musculoskeletal anatomy (i.e., bone shape, skeletal kinematics, tendon and ligament strain, muscle force, and joint space). To accomplish this, the MR imaging and analysis capabilities already developed will be combined with highly accurate, imaging-based measurement and registration methodologies in order to non-invasively quantify complete joint anatomy and tissue dynamics during functional movements. Additionally, these tools will enable the quantification of 3D bone shape so that the effect that alterations joint and tissue dynamics have on bone shape can be quantified. Accomplishing the aims of the VFA initiative will fill an important knowledge gap that exists between the relationship of normal or impaired joint structure/function and the functional movement limitations associated with performing activities of daily living. In doing so, it will position the National Institutes of Health as an international leader in diagnostic evaluation of musculoskeletal impairments by advancing musculoskeletal diagnostic and evaluation tools from primarily static 2D tools to dynamic tools that can quantify 3D musculoskeletal function during dynamic tasks.  Due to the natural tiered structure of this research, two primary paths are currently being pursued, one based using the VFA project in its current state to evaluate both normative and impaired joint kinematics and the other is the continued development of the VFA tools so that full musculoskeletal kinetics can be evaluated. The latter will require the development of methodologies for creating 3D digital images of loaded and moving joint tissues (bone, cartilage, and connective tissues) to reveal joint contact patterns and tissue loads. As part of the kinematics branch, the variability of bone shape and the sensitivity of defined joint posture (translation and rotation of one bone relative to another) to osteo-based coordinate system will be quantified. We intend to use these capabilities to document and evaluate the function of normal and impaired joint structures (e.g., Cerebral Palsy, Ehlos Danof syndrome, and patellar tracking syndrome) under simulated conditions experienced during activities of daily living.   VFA Dynamic Tool Development Over the past year, we have maintained a research focus on developing the backbone for VFA and began to explore the issues surrounding the dynamic MR scanning of the musculoskeletal system. The key focal points for the algorithm development remained the image registration process along with continuing improvement in the integration algorithms. Fast-PC MRI provides 3D kinematics information for the bones of a joint (e.g., knee and ankle) as the subject brings this joint through a specified range of motion. Yet, this information cannot be readily applied to 3D models of the bones, which are created from static high-resolution scans of the joint. In order to apply the kinematics from the fast-PC MRI to the static models, the two image data sets have to be aligned (e.g., registered). Visualization is made possible by programs that have been written in-house using Matlabs scripting language. The development has now advanced to incorporate the evaluation of cartilage contact mechanics and much of the research focus is now concentrated in this area. A paper detailing the accuracy of this technique and a paper providing the first dynamic quantification of in vivo patellofemoral cartilage contact mechanics has been published.  Another focus of the tool development is to expand the imaging modalities that are included within the VFA toolbox. To this end, we are collaborating with George Mason University in order to develop ultrasound techniques that can accurately track muscle motion.  Lastly, through a collaboration with CIT and Eramacus (Netherlands), the VFA toolbox has been expanded to include automatic segmentation of the patellar and femoral bones from MR images.  In Vivo Normal and Impaired Knee Joint Function On the experimental side, a primary focus has been on evaluating the clinical applicability of the tools being developed by applying them to the study of knee joint function in children and adults diagnosed with patellofemoral pain syndrome (n=100). The ultimate goal is to evaluate pre- and post-intervention joint function. We are in the process of analyzing the data acquired in order to quantify the various musculoskeletal parameters, such as joint kinematics, tendon strains, and tendon moment arms. Much of this analysis has been completed and presented to the scientific community by way of peer-reviewed publications and conference presentations. As we complete the VFA toolbox, we should also be able to quantify forces in the quadriceps muscles, patellar tendon, the anterior cruciate ligament, and the cartilage during an extension/flexion cycle of the knee joint. The kinematics from these populations are being compared to our normative database. A major focus of this year has been on patellofemoral pain syndrome, knees that have experienced a single dislocation, and cerebral palsy.  In Vivo Hip Joint Function As part of Dr. Sheehan's work as a mentor for a K-award, a project evaluating the dynamics of the hip joint in both healthy controls and female subjects with hip pain has begun. The project is in its preliminary stages.  In Vivo Shoulder Function 3D static MRI has been collected for 15 children with unilateral obstetric brachial plexus palsy and 12 matched controls. The current goal is to evaluate muscle volume and bone shape in these children and correlate that to measures of shoulder kinematics and strength. To this end, we have published a paper on 3D humeral shape changes in children with OBPP and a paper on the shoulder muscle volumes in typically developing children. A paper in regards to the relationship between muscle atrophy and loss of strength in children with OBPP is in review. Finally, a paper in regards to the 3D gleno-humeral shape changes in children with OBPP is being prepared for submission. This project garnered the interest of outside clinicians and has promoted new collaborations, which will allow this project to continue to expand.  PF pain in Adolescent Females In this past year, much of our attention has focused on studying the potential etiologies of PF pain in adolescent females. PF pain is typically assumed to be an overuse issue in adolescents. Yet, we have demonstrated that patellar maltracking is a likely contributor to this pain. Interestingly, these maltracking patterns are unique from those seen in adults and they appear not to change as the adolescents mature into adulthood."

"9552557","There are approximately 65.7 million unpaid caregivers in the United States with an estimated 8% providing care to someone with cancer. Although benefit-finding has been reported, providing care to a spouse or loved one with cancer is stressful and can have negative consequences for an individuals psychological and physical health. In cancer caregivers, studies have documented negative outcomes including symptoms of fatigue, impaired sleep quality, poor quality of life, anxiety and depression. These outcomes are of particular concern when cancer patients receive intense treatment such as hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) where caregivers are embedded in a treatment trajectory that can extend 4  12 months.   Few studies have explored the association among physiological and clinical factors that may affect HSCT caregivers overall risk for cardiovascular disease. While there is evidence indicating that the profound stress experienced by cancer caregivers appears to be associated with autonomic nervous system dysregulation, very little existing evidence suggests that this dysregulation is related to cardiovascular risk. The evidence is lacking even more in transplant caregivers, where no published studies have examined the physiological and behavioral changes that occur in this population over time, nor the cardiovascular risk these individuals face as a result of the overwhelming burden of assisting their loved one through the fear and suffering associated with transplantation.    The design of this study was informed from the results of a prior pilot study and phase II study completed at the NIH, Clinical Center. Data from these studies, along with findings from our prior analyses have provided essential information to inform the design of this pilot study which will explore the physiological and clinical markers of chronic stress and cardiovascular risk in a sample of allogeneic HSCT caregivers.   The primary objective of this study is to compare physiologic and biomarkers of cardiovascular illness among HSCT caregivers to non-caregivers. A sample of non-caregivers, matched minimally for age, gender, and race/ethnicity are also recruited study participation to serve as study control for each enrolled caregiver subject. The study was approved by the IRB originally on September 30, 2011. Study recruitment began in November 2011; the 1st subject was enrolled in December 2011. The study completed participant accrual in April 2013 and remains open for data analyses only. N=50 subjects (n=26 HSCT caregiver subjects and n=24 matching normal volunteers) have been enrolled with 41 participants (21 caregivers and 20 matching normal volunteers) completing all study procedures. A total of 9 subjects were removed from study (n=5 caregiver subjects and n=4 matching normal volunteers).   Each caregiver participant has data collected prior to the transplant recipients HSCT (day 0), during the first week of outpatient visits following the transplant recipients initial discharge from the inpatient setting, and finally 6 weeks post the transplant recipients initial discharge from the hospital. Questionnaires include: Caregiver Reaction Assessment (caregivers only), Health-Promoting Lifestyle Profile II, Perceived Stress Scale, The UCLA Loneliness Scale (Version 3), General Self-Efficacy Scale, and PROMIS Short Forms for Anxiety, Depression, Sleep disturbance and Fatigue. Clinical variables (e.g. vital signs), physiological variables (e.g. cortisol), questionnaires and a medical history and limited physical exam are collected during the clinic visits for both caregiver and matched normal volunteer subjects."

"9549507","Bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) have shown significant promise in the treatment of disease, but their therapeutic efficacy is often limited by inefficient homing of systemically administered cells, which results in low number of cells accumulating at sites of pathology. BMSC home to areas of inflammation where local expression of cell adhesion molecules and chemokine gradients are present. Pulsed focused ultrasound (pFUS) employs non-continuous exposures, that lower the rate of energy deposition and allow cooling to occur between pulses, thereby minimizing thermal effects and emphasizing the effects created by non-thermal mechanisms of FUS (i.e. acoustic radiation forces and acoustic cavitation). We examined changes in the kidney following pFUS has little effect on the histological integrity of the tissue and does not induce cell death. pFUS increased expression of several chemoattractants creating a transient molecular zip code on days 0 and 1 following pFUS that returns to baseline levels by day 3 post-pFUS. pFUS exposures induced up-regulation of cell adhesion molecules on muscle vasculature. We induce a mechanotransductive response that initiates a largely an anti-inflammatory M2-type macrophage environment. We demonstrated local upregulation of chemoattractants in pFUS-treated kidney leads to enhance homing, permeability, and retention of BMSC. We also demonstrate that the induced molecular changes following pFUS to the kidney can be block by ibuprofen, a cyclooxygenase 2 inhibitor, or TNF alpha receptor binding protein, etanercept, indicating that the mechanotransductive effects are acting through a NFkB and COX 2 pathway in the tissue. Both ibuprofen or etanercept administered prior to pFUS and stem cell infusion block the homing of stem cells to targeted muscle which indicated that using this approach we can use pFUS to interrogate drug-host tissue interactions and their effect on homing.  We also demonstrated that pFUS exposures in combination with BMSC in an acute kidney injury model induce mechanotransductive effects in the murine kidney (AKI). To examine the efficacy of pFUS-enhanced cell homing in disease, we targeted pFUS to kidneys to enhance BMSC homing after cisplatin-induced AKI. We found that pFUS enhanced BMSC homing at 1 day post-cisplatin, prior to renal functional deficits, and that enhanced homing improved outcomes of renal function, tubular cell death, and regeneration at 5 days post-cisplatin compared to BMSCs alone. After observing improved homing and AKI outcomes during early AKI, we investigated whether pFUS+BMSC therapy could rescue established AKI. BMSC administration alone at 3 days post-cisplatin, after renal functional deficits become obvious, significantly improved 7-day survival of animals. Survival was further improved using pFUS+BMSC. BMSCs, alone or with pFUS, shifted the kidney macrophage phenotype from M1 to M2. This study shows that pFUS serves as a neoadjuvant treatment to improve MSC homing to diseased organs. We have also shown that pFUS increases interferon gamma in tissue that augments the local potency of the infused BMSC that home to the tissue by stimulating release of interleukin (IL) 10 from infused cells.. We also have similar results in critical limb ischemia model in which we have been able to demonstrate that the combination of pFUS+BMSC resulted in greater reperfusion of the ischemic limb compared to animal receiving pFUS or BMSC alone.  Evaluation of the tissue demonstrated pFUS pretreatment followed by BMSC infusion of the ischemic muscle increased the amount of human vascular endothelia growth factor and interleukin 10 present in the microenvironment compared to animals only receiving BMSC injections.  These results indicate that pFUS preconditions the tissues that results in increased potency of the BMSC that homed to targeted tissues and has important implication for translation to clinical trials. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-guided pulsed focused ultrasound (pFUS) combined with systemic infusion of ultrasound contrast agent microbubbles (MB) causes localized bloodbrain barrier (BBB) disruption as evidenced by contrast-enhanced  MRI, resulted in an immediate damage-associated molecular pattern (DAMP) response including elevations in heat-shock protein 70, IL-1, IL-18, and tumor necrosis factor indicative of a sterile inflammatory response (SIR) in the parenchyma.  Concurrent with DAMP presentation, significant elevations in proinflammatory, antiinflammatory, and trophic factors along with neurotrophic and neurogenesis factors were detected that lasted 24 h. The effect of pFUS+MB was due to an intravascular shock wave from stable cavitation of the MB and resulted in TUNEL+ neurons, activated microglia and astrocytes and an innate immune response that would be compatible with mild trauma or ischemia in the brain."
"9555577","Persistent and chronic infections are maintained by a dynamic modulation of microbe - host cell interactions.  During this process, microorganisms evolve and adapt to the host by regulating the expression of different genes, in particular those involved in virulence.  At the bacterial population level, specific (possibly hypervirulent) clones may predominate at different times in individuals as well as groups of patients. The timely storage of microbial pathogens in the microbiology laboratory together with the availability of clinical data from the patients allows following virulence traits, host adaptation and changing epidemiology of the pathogens.  Two specific examples are summarized below: 1) Work on Mycobacterium abscessus revealed high relatedness between strains involved in global outbreaks in cystic fibrosis patients. Serial isolates from the index case of a CF outbreak iprovided valuable insights on the adaptative changes of M. abscessus towards more virulent and possibly more transmissible populations. Interestingly, M. abscessus adaptation and virulence traits share some striking similarities to Mycobacterium tuberculosis. 2) We have recently described a novel and emerging species of molds causing disease in immunocompromised patients. One example is the recovery of a recently described species of Mucor spp from several immunocompromised patients. Whole genome sequencing and comparative genomics of invasive and non invasive Mucor strains is underway."

"9395897","ABSTRACT Each year 1.5 million people are diagnosed with an incidentally (not screen) detected lung nodule. The diagnosis is important because it may represent an early-stage lung cancer, but 90% of incidentally detected lung nodules are benign. Accordingly, the intensity of a lung nodule evaluation must weigh the benefits of early-detection and treatment (e.g. cure) against the risks of diagnostic tests (e.g. radiation exposure, procedure-related adverse events). Practice guideline recommendations are intended to optimize risks and benefits but adherence rates are only 55%. One reason for this poor adherence is the low level of evidence supporting guidelines leading to legitimate uncertainty about their effectiveness, safety, and impact on health care resources. This uncertainty is significant because it is unclear whether interventions should be developed to increase guideline adherence or if new approaches to varying the intensity of a nodule evaluation are needed. Until recently, an important barrier to generating a higher level of evidence has been an inability to identify and longitudinally follow a cohort of individuals with an incidentally detected lung nodule. Investigators from the Cancer Research Network (CRN) have determined that individuals with an incidentally detected lung nodule can be efficiently and accurately identified using a combination of administrative data, electronic radiology reports, natural language processing, and some chart abstraction. Additionally, investigators found that providers routinely document lung cancer risk factors (e.g. age and smoking status) that allow for a study of adherence to Fleischner Society guidelines, and this information is readily available in a structured format within the electronic medical record. Furthermore, other CRN investigators have developed methods that allow for estimation of radiation exposure from imaging studies and the costs of care delivery within integrated healthcare systems. This work allows us to propose the first-ever multi-site comparative-effectiveness study of individuals with an incidentally detected lung nodule diagnosed between 2005 and 2015. The study aims to compare the: 1) effectiveness (e.g. incidence of early-stage lung cancer), 2) potential harms (e.g. radiation exposure, procedure-related adverse events), and 3) two-year total costs of care of varying intensities of lung nodule evaluation (e.g. guideline concordant versus more intense versus less intense evaluations). We hypothesize that less intense nodule evaluations are associated with a lower incidence of early-stage lung cancer compared to guideline concordant care, and more intense nodule evaluations are associated with greater radiation exposure, more procedure-related adverse events, and higher costs. Findings from this study will determine whether limited resources should be invested in developing system-level interventions designed to increase guideline adherence or studying alternative approaches to lung nodule evaluation (e.g. risk- prediction models, biomarkers). This line of investigation is expected to ultimately improve the care and outcomes of individuals with an incidentally detected lung nodule."
"9432328","PROJECT SUMMARY: Neurovascular coupling, the close spatial and temporal relationship between neural activity and hemodynamics that regulates delivery of metabolic substrates to meet the demands of neuronal activation, is crucial to the structural and functional integrity of the brain. It also forms the basis of modern neuroimaging techniques such as fMRI that use hemodynamic responses to map brain function. Despite of its significant fundamental and clinical importance, the quantitative relationship between changes in hemodynamics and neural activity including the spatial extent of the coupling remains rudimentary; the quantitative effects of cerebrovascular diseases on neurovascular coupling and their dependence on the severity and progression of the diseases are understudied. Such knowledge gaps impose limitations on the precise clinical interpretation of widely applied neuroimaging techniques, and the therapeutic opportunities to clearly target the impairment of neurovascular coupling for treatment. The objective of this project is to provide spatiotemporally resolved quantification of neurovascular coupling in health and during the progression of stroke and hypertension. The hypothesis is that neurovascular coupling can be quantified and tracked by applying a novel chronic multimodal neural platform that simultaneously map both neural activity and hemodynamic parameters with high spatial- and temporal resolution over weeks to months in behaving animals. This is enabled by our recent development of a novel type of ultraflexible nanoelectronic neural electrodes that provide spatially resolved neural activity recording with seamless tissue integration and chronic optical access. We will combine these electrodes with a novel functional optical imaging system that simultaneously images and quantifies the full-field cerebral blood flow and oxygen tension (pO2). We will apply this multimodal system in behaving mice to quantify neurovascular coupling including the spatiotemporal pattern, the functional form, and the alteration due to progressing ischemia, hypertension and both. The application is highly innovative, in the applicant?s opinion, because it integrates technical advancements at multiple fronts to provide a highly novel and powerful combination of techniques that permits quantification of neurovascular coupling in previously unattainable temporal and spatial regimes. The application is significant, because it is expected to have broad translational importance both in the precise clinical interpretation of neuroimaging techniques, and in the intervention of cerebrovascular diseases where neurovascular coupling is known to be severely compromised. The long-term goal of this project is to understand the impairment of neurovascular coupling in stroke and hypertension with mechanisms similar to those occurred in human patient in order to unravel the mechanism of hypertension as the leading risk factor for stroke, and to improve prevention and intervention strategies for hypertensive stroke patients."
"9549542","While immune cells play a critical role in early innate immune responses and microbial clearance during infection, excessive immune cell activity and the inflammatory host responses this activation may elicit, can also lead to inadvertent host tissue injury. The host has therefore developed mechanisms to control and coordinate immune cell activity.  The programed death 1 (PD-1) signaling pathway is one such mechanism. The development of PD-1 expression on lymphocytes and its stimulation by PD-1 ligand (PD-L1) on other immune cells is associated with a suppressed immune phenotype. Although the suppressed state associated with PD-1 expression is the hosts attempt to keep an excessive immune response in check, if it occurs too early during infection or if it is too great during later infection, PD-1 signaling may actually impair host defense and microbial clearance and worsen outcome. Studies have now suggested that the blockade of PD-L1/PD-1 signaling can restore lymphocyte host defense function and may be protective under some conditions. In one study, PD-1 knockout animals were resistant to cecal-ligation and puncture (CLP)-induced septic shock. In other studies, provision of an anti PD-1 or anti PD-L1 antibody both very early after the onset of infection (3 hours after induction of peritonitis) and much later (up to 5 days after induction of peritonitis) provided protection. One group has also shown that PD-1 blockade leads to a reduction in peritoneal lavage bacteria colony counts in conjunction with higher plasma levels of inflammatory cytokines.  Thus, modulating the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway holds promise in the treatment of severe infection. However, understanding under which conditions such inhibition will have beneficial as opposed to harmful effects is important for determining how widely PD-1 inhibition might be applied during clinical infection. Because the severity of underlying infection is one condition that varies substantially in patients presenting with sepsis and has an important impact on the efficacy of other immune-modulators, determining whether PD-1/PD-L1 inhibition has beneficial effects with both mild and severe infection is a critical question. Also, because, PD-1/PD-L1 inhibition has been studied exclusively in peritoneal infection models, determining whether it is also beneficial in the context of pulmonary infection, the most common cause of sepsis clinically, is important.  To test these questions, in the present study we plan to compare the effects of an anti-PD-L1 mAb versus placebo in mice challenged with intratracheal (IT) doses of S. aureus (SA) bacteria (i.e. a pneumonia model) designed to produce either low or high mortality rates (25% mortality, mild infection vs. 75%, severe infection respectively). The study will be done in 2 parts. The first part (Part 1) will include experiments to determine the doses of bacteria that will produce the low or high mortality rates that we seek and to also confirm that IT infection alters PD-1/PD-L1 expression on circulating and tissue immune cells. The second part (Part 2) will include two groups of experiments. One group will compare the effects of anti-PD-L1 mAb versus control on survival in mice challenged with IT SA low or high doses and observed for up to 168h. The other group will compare the effects of these two treatments on blood and lung bacteria counts, cytokine levels, PD-1/PD-L1 tissue expression, tissue injury scores and other measures.  Progress report: 1.  We have determined the two doses of intratracheal SA that yield low or high mortality in mice. 2.  We have started interrogating the local immune response to low or high dose SA, with respect to numbers and types of immune cells recruited, as well as PD-1 and PD-L1 expression. 3.  Collected serum and tissues will analyzed for cytokine levels and histology as well as colony counts."

Past and present Scholars have worked in areas such as the mechanism of nuclear reprogramming, structural biology of malaria antigens, immune response to tumors, cancer therapeutics, molecular bases for immunodeficiency, host-microbiome interactions, lung and intestinal stem cells, molecular pathology of streptococcal infection, and disorders of sexual differentiation. These investigations will elucidate fundamental molecular mechanisms and will lead to the development of new therapeutic modalities in all areas of pediatric disease, including hematology/oncology, endocrinology, nephrology, infectious disease, immunology, pulmonology and neurology. !"
"9600183","PROJECT SUMMARY The drug development pipeline is plagued by unacceptable rates of attrition due in large part to toxicities that are not identified in pre-clinical stages of development. The ability to de-risk lead compounds during pre-clinical development with advanced ?organoid-on-a-chip? technologies shows tremendous promise. Drug-induced neurotoxicity is caused by off-target effects of pharmaceuticals that lead to sensory, motor, and cognitive deficits. While rarely fatal, drug-induced neurotoxicity can lead to permanent nerve damage and in some cases can be a dose-limiting side effect, leading patients to reduce dosage or stop treatment altogether. Although the peripheral nervous system bears the brunt of this neurological toxicity, development of microphysiological models of the peripheral nervous system is lagging. Towards that end, the technology described herein allows for 3D growth of high density axonal fiber tracts, resembling peripheral nerve anatomy. Progress during the prior award phase strongly demonstrated the feasibility of using microengineered neural tissues that are amenable to morphological and physiological measurements analogous to those of clinical tests. The use of structural and functional analyses should mean drug-induced neural toxicity will manifest in these measurements in ways that mimic clinical neuropathology. The goals of this proposal are to establish our human model using relevant physiological measurements in tissues fabricated from human iPS cells, and to validate the model system with a library of compounds, comparing against conventional cell culture models. Validating the peripheral nerve model system with drugs known to induce toxicity via a range of mechanisms will demonstrate the ability of the system to predict various classifications of neuropathy, yielding a high-content assay far more informative than traditional in vitro systems."
"9446765","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Tumor resistance to radiotherapy remains a critical barrier to improving outcomes for patients diagnosed with locally advanced, unresectable cancers. Cellular sensitivity to ionizing radiation (IR) is governed by intracellular and extracellular factors. To overcome tumor radioresistance, drugs that sensitize tumor cells to ionizing radiation (IR) are used. Non-targeted cytotoxic chemotherapies given concurrently with radiotherapy have demonstrated improved tumor control and overall survival in cancer patients. However, since this paradigm shifting approach occurred in the 1980's there has been a shocking lack of progress in developing molecularly targeted radiosensitization approaches. Improving the therapeutic ratio of IR in combination with systemically delivered drugs can be achieved by two general approaches, 1) using drugs that block DNA damage repair responses 2) delivering radiosensitizing drugs selectively to tumors. These two methods are orthogonal techniques to achieve the same end goal of increasing IR induced tumor kill while reducing normal tissue toxicities. To address both of these fundamental cancer therapy problems, we have focused on target discovery and tumor selective drug delivery vehicles. With regards to target discovery, our recent studies on non-canonical CRAF functions led to our discovery of an unexpected role for PAK in DNA damage repair and sensitivity to IR. PAK is comprised of a family of six kinases subdivided in Group I and II. Importantly, PAK are involved in process central to oncogenesis, tumor aggressiveness and patient survival. To tackle tumor selective drug delivery, we are developing drug conjugated activatable cell penetrating peptides (ACPP) to selectively deliver potent radiosensitizers to tumors based on extracellular tumor protease activity. ACPP consist of a drug conjugated polycationic cell penetrating peptide and an autoinhibitory polyanionic peptide separated from each other by a flexible peptide linker. This peptide linker is specifically cleaved by proteases enriched in the extracellular tumor microenvironment. While ACPP is intact, the drug conjugated cell penetrating peptide is neutralized (i.e. held in a ?pro-drug? state) by the polyanionic peptide so that the drug cannot gain access to its intracellular target. Tumor microenvironment proteases cleave ACPP and release the drug conjugated cell penetrating peptide, which is then taken up by tumor cells. The goals of our proposal are to gain insight into how PAK governs radioresistance and then therapeutically exploit this with targeted PAK inhibitors. In Aim 1, we will genetically determine the mechanisms through which Group I and II PAKs govern IR resistance. In Aim 2, we will pharmacologically test the ability to radiosensitize tumors with small molecule PAK inhibitors. In Aim 3, we will test if tumor targeted ACPP increase the therapeutic ratio of conjugated PAK inhibitors. Our approach has complementary innovations in both DNA damage target discovery and tumor selective drug delivery. Combining these approaches will lay a foundation for moving away from non-targeted cytotoxic radiosensitization to biomarker driven molecularly guided radiosensitization."
"9521280","?    DESCRIPTION: Infection with Human Immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 injures the brain and compromises memory and cognition. Our and other laboratories have found consistent evidence that HIV-1 infection and neurotoxic immune stimulation of microglia and macrophages (MF) in the brain trigger neuronal damage and impairment of neurogenesis. Recently, we found in a transgenic (tg) model of HIV-associated brain injury induced by a CXCR4-utilizing viral envelope gp120 that the genetic knockout (KO) of CCR5 prevented microglial activation and neuronal damage. The CCR5KO also protected gp120tg mice from impairment of spatial learning and memory. Thus CCR5 critically contributed to brain injury by a CXCR4-utilizing gp120. In additional studies we identified lipocalin-2 (LCN2), an acute phase protein, as a novel potentially cytotoxic player in HIVgp120- associated neuronal injury as well as reduction of microglial cell numbers in the CCR5KO. However, the extent to which LCN2 contributes to HIV/gp120-associated brain injury in vivo and the molecular mechanisms of the interaction between LCN2 and CCR5 are unknown and will be studied here using in vivo and in vitro models. We hypothesize that genetic deletion of LCN2 can ameliorate or prevent neuronal damage and behavioral impairment induced by HIV and gp120. The long-term objectives are to find new therapeutic targets for prevention of HIV-associated brain injury. The specific aims (SA) are: (1) To study in vivo whether genetic deletion of lipocalin-2 prevents neuronal damage and astrocytosis in a HIV/gp120 transgenic mouse model. (2) To investigate whether deletion or knockdown of lipocalin-2 in microglia or MF ameliorates the cells' neurotoxicity induced by HIV-infection or viral gp120. (3) To assess whether deletion of lipocalin-2 in neurons and astrocytes suffices to protect the cells against HIV-1 or gp120-induced neurotoxicity of microglia and MF. We have already generated LCN2-deficient HIVgp120tg animals of both CCR5WT and CCR5KO genotypes proving viability. We will assess performance in behavioral tasks of memory and cognition, and analyze neuronal injury and gliosis in comparison with control animals in SA1. For SA2 and 3, we will use neurons, astrocytes and microglia of LCN2KO, CCR5KO and WT in mixed genotype cerebrocortical cell cultures in combination with HIV-infected human macrophages to analyze the contribution of the distinct cell types to neurotoxicity of HIV-1, gp120 and LCN2. For all three Specific Aims cellular injury and death will be analyzed by deconvolution microscopy after immunolabeling for neuronal cellular and synaptic markers and fluorescence staining of intact and fragmented nuclear DNA. Biochemical, molecular biology and imaging techniques will be employed to monitor and study the involvement of LCN2 and its receptors, iron-regulatory proteins, signaling factors, cell death-related proteins, markers of astrocyte and microglia/MF activation and HIV/gp120 receptors. In addition, time course experiments and bioinformatic tools will be used to identify and characterize mechanistically involved biological networks and pathways."
"9574350","Principal Investigator/Program Director (Last, first, middle): Blagg, Brian, S. J. Summary To date, there are very limited therapies for patients with metastatic castrate resistant prostate cancer. Due to the heterogeneity of prostate cancer no one specific oncogene, mutation, signaling pathways, or risk factor has been described in prostate cancer. Multiple pathways have been described to contribute to both the development as well as progression of prostate cancer. Hsp90 has been shown to be over-expressed in prostate cancer and serves as a hub for multiple signaling pathways that contribute to malignant growth and proliferation, making it an excellent target for the development of inhibitors. In contrast to N-terminal inhibitors that induce the pro-survival heat shock response, C-terminal inhibitors do not, and therefore provide a new paradigm in cancer research. Specifically, we aim to prepare conformationally biased analogues of new Hsp90 C-terminal inhibitors, evaluate them through a series of novel assays in vitro, and then administer select compounds to an orthotopic model of prostate cancer to determine their efficacy. Upon completion of this project, we aim to produce compounds amenable to further evaluation in clinical trials for prostate cancer. Project Description Page 6"
"9392911","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A major challenge in islet transplantation is avoiding early islet destruction and primary nonfunction after intraportal islet infusion. Because of these issues, at least two donors are needed for one recipient to achieve euglycemia after allogeneic islet transplantation (for patients with type 1 diabetes, T1D), and only around 1/3 of patients become insulin-independent after autologous islet transplantation (for patients with chronic pancreatitis, CP). Currently, no interventional protocols are in place with the goal to increase th survival of islet graft following transplantation in patients receiving islet transplantation. Thus effective therapies that can facilitate islet cell engraftment and promote survival after transplantation are urgently needed. Alpha1 anti-trypsin (AAT) is a serine proteinase inhibitor that inhibits various enzymes including elastase, trypsin and others. AAT manifests strong anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic properties and promotes vascularization. AAT infusion during peritransplantation period protects islets from immune rejection and preserves islets/? cell function in mice, pigs, and non-human primates, as manifested in autologous, allogeneic and xenogeneic islet transplant settings. Given this framework, we plan to conduct a clinical study to evaluate the therapeutic effects of the human purified AAT, Prolastin-C (Grifols Inc), in the prevention of islet death and dysfunction in autologous islet transplantation for chronic pancreatitis patients at the Medical University of South Carolina. In this study, we will further validate the protective effects of AAT observed in mice intrahepatic islet transplantation models using human islets from cadaveric donors and CP patients, by evaluating the effect of AAT in abrogating proinflammatory injury, islet death, and delayed revascularization that might contribute to primary islet nonfunction and islet destruction post transplantation. Furthermore, we will assess the efficacy of AAT administration during peritransplantation period for the prevention of surgical diabetes and the improvement of glycemic control after total pancreatectomy and islet autotransplantation in CP patients. Having been used for the treatment of pulmonary emphysema for more than 25 years, AAT has excellent safety record. The islet autotransplantation model offers a unique opportunity to assess the direct effect of AAT on human islets in the absence of an immune response, recurrence of autoimmunity, and insulin resistance. Results from these studies are not only urgently needed for the prevention of post-surgical diabetes in CP patients, but can serve as a powerful platform on which to address the more complex allogeneic islet cell transplantation for patients with T1D."
"9430734","The fungus Candida albicans causes diverse infections with substantial morbidity and mortality. The organism remains a threat for many reasons, including the limited spectrum of antifungal drugs, the occurrence of drug resistance, and the array of virulence determinants that enable it to infect almost any tissue. Much of our mechanistic understanding of C. albicans infection biology comes from analysis of one clinical isolate, strain SC5314, and its derivatives. One chronic knowledge gap in the field is the extent to which conclusions from analysis of SC5314 can be generalized to other clinical isolates. For C. albicans, as for most pathogens, there is considerable phenotypic diversity among clinical isolates. On that basis, we believe that it is critical to validate gene functions with a panel of C. albicans strain isolates in order to prioritize genes and pathways for further study and therapeutic targeting. Our goal is to develop a toolbox that enables rapid and precise genetic manipulation of diverse clinical C. albicans isolates. We will use the recently described C. albicans CRISPR-Cas9 system along with a marker excision system we have just developed. We seek to create a system for rapid and rigorous genetic assays in clinical C. albicans isolates through implementation first in the cornerstone clinical isolate, SC5314, where we will make an appraisal consistency and off-target effects of our procedure. We will then move to a panel of clinical isolates as a test case for appraisal of natural variation in gene function, using the well-studied virulence regulator Efg1 for a test case. Proposed studies will provide a paradigm for multi-strain gene function validation in C. albicans, and will yield materials and methods to enable implementation in the community. In addition, our marker recycling approach relies upon conserved cellular machinery, and thus may be useful in many other organisms."
"9535712","Project Summary  During the current project period, the Abramson Cancer Center (ACC) used Developmental Funds to support  innovative new research through a Pilot Project Program, and also to provide support to our Shared  Resources. These funds have stimulated research in areas of strategic importance to the ACC. This support is  essential to the ACC's ability to execute its responsibilities in stimulating transdisciplinary and translational  research and to encourage research in areas of priority to both the ACC and the NCI. Pilot awards are issued  based on a long-standing, well-established peer review process involving senior and junior ACC members from  multiple departments and disciplines. This process is similar to the peer review process used by the NCI.  During the current project period plus the last year of the previous project period, 32 pilot projects were  awarded. 17 new externally funded grants were awarded to recipients ($2.3M annual direct costs) and another  eight are pending. 33 peer-reviewed articles were published by recipients. Developmental Funds for Shared  Resources were also used to support a developing animal pathology core, which is now a fully established  Shared Resource in this renewal application. In the coming cycle, we are requesting Developmental Funds to  continue our robust Pilot Project Program, to aid in the development of new Shared Resources, to provide  support to our Staff Investigators and to continue our recruitment of faculty-level scientists in areas of strategic  need."
"9600194","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The presence of latent HIV in individuals treated with highly active antiretroviral therapy (ART) has been well established. Without additional therapies, individuals must remain on ART indefinitely in order to avoid development of severe immunodeficiency and spread of the virus. Because of the existence of this reservoir, treatment interruption invariably leads to viral rebound. Thus, it is generally accepted that eradication of the virus will require elimination of the latent reservoir.  A drug type under investigation, although not in human trials at this time, is the family of protein kinase C agonists. We and others demonstrated that PKC agonists, in general, display strong activity across cell models of latency and in patient cells. Ingenol, a protein kinase C (PKC) agonist found in Euphorbiacea, a large family of succulent plants from semi-desertic areas of Brazil, has shown great potency in ex vivo patient cell assays and in in vitro systems.  In the R21 phase, we will examine how ingenol derivatives mediate reactivation of latent HIV and which subset(s) of PKC isoforms. In Aim 1, we plan to investigate the mechanism of action of various ingenol derivatives. In Aim 2 we will investigate a role for HDAC inhibitors to enhance the activity of ingenols based on their ability to induce relaxed chromatin states. These studies will inform Aim 3, where we will test the best concentrations and combinations of the above drug categories in cells from aviremic patients. These studies will set the stage for testing of these compounds in the R33 phase of the grant.  The R33 phase will consist of Aims 3 and 4. Aim 3 will examine the potential influence that our optimized stimulation regimen(s) will have on the functionality of human immune effector cells, whether these are enhancing or perhaps deleterious to their activities. The cell types being examined will include natural killer cells, cytotoxic T lymphocytes, dendritic cells an regulatory T cells.Aim 4 will test the best concentrations and combinations of the most potent ingenol derivative with and without an HDAC inhibitor in a humanized mouse model of HIV latency."
"9535720","Project Summary  The Melanoma and Cutaneous Malignancies Program is a multidisciplinary Research Program that has been  supported by the NCI CCSG since 1978. It provides the organizational structure and research forum for the  efficient conduct of collaborative basic, clinical, and epidemiologic research in melanoma, basal and squamous  cell carcinoma, and cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. Lynn Schuchter, MD has been Program Leader since 2007,  after being an active member since 1989. John Seykora, MD, PhD was appointed Co-Leader in 2014 given the  expansion of the Program into non-melanoma skin cancers. Members have a high degree of collaboration with  other Research Programs and extramural investigators. The primary goal of the Program is to improve survival  and quality of life for patients with melanoma, non-melanoma skin cancers and CTCL through basic,  translational, and clinical epidemiological research. Three highly translational thematic areas of scientific focus  include: epidemiology and risk assessment; the biology of cutaneous malignancies; and experimental  therapeutics, including both targeted and immunotherapeutic approaches. The cohesiveness of the Program is  maintained through several collaborative mechanisms (monthly research meetings, weekly tumor boards,  monthly research in progress meetings, a yearly retreat sponsored by the Cancer Center) and NCI-funded  multi-investigator research grants. The Program's 26 members are drawn from 11 departments from Penn's  Perelman School of Medicine and two departments from The Wistar Institute. Critically important resources  have been developed by Program members, and are supported by the Cancer Center, which have fostered the  highly productive, translational research that distinguishes this Program. The resources include a  comprehensive melanoma database; a melanoma pathology archive, from which investigators can access  annotated pathology slides and blocks (normal skin and lesions) of patients seen as far back as 30 years ago;  and a large biorepository of thousands of collected blood and tumor samples from patients with cutaneous  lymphoma. During the project period, the Program has been remarkably productive with numerous  investigator-initiated clinical trials and publications in high impact journals including New England Journal of  Medicine, Journal of Clinical Oncology, Cell, and Journal of Clinical Investigation. The success of these efforts  is reflected in the award of an NCI Skin Cancer SPORE and additional grants in laboratory-based translational  and population science research, including two NCI P01 grants to support innovative clinical/translational  research. In total, members have $4.1M in research funding (annual direct costs) of which $2.3M is peer-  reviewed and $1.5 is from the NCI. During the project period, members published 373 cancer-related  publications, of which 22% were intra-Programmatic, 30% were inter-Programmatic and 58% were multi-  institutional."
"9549437","Development of laboratory procedures for handling a variety of sample types.  Establishment of the NIH Bioinformatics Cooperative (http://affylims.cit.nih.gov/); development and dissemination of the MSCL toolbox; construction of a database containing over 4000 microarrays.  Co-founded the NIH sponsored Symposium on the Functional Genomics of Critical Illness and Injury. The seven meetings in this series (last: December 2009) focused on knowledge emerging from functional genomic databases relevant to critical care medicine. This meeting led to the formation of the US Critical Illness and Injury Trials Group (USCIITG: http://www.usciitg.org/), as a forum to further investigator initiated Intensive Care Medicine research on a national scale.  Interactions between IFN-alpha and dexamethasone were investigated in primary bronchial epithelial cells (Physiologic Genomics 2005). Dexamethasone was found to broadly suppress late IFN-alpha-induced responses.  Global transcriptional analysis of circulating leukocytes demonstrated oxidant and inflammatory vascular injury in sickle cell disease (Blood 2004). The human reticulocyte transcriptome was characterized extending our understanding of circulating cell-types (Physiol Genomics 2007). Expression profiling of platelets in sickle cell disease associated circulatory stress in this disorder with abnormalities of arginine metabolism (Circulation 2007).  Single dose intravenous endotoxin administration to humans produced a rich profile of gene expression changes in blood (Physiol Genomics 2006). T lymphocyte-associated genes were repressed. Notably, these alterations in gene expression were rapidly extinguished within 24 h.  Gene expression profiling was used to globally identify numerous genes regulated by NO. This work led to the discovery of new signal transduction pathways and regulatory mechanisms by which NO influences inflammation and cell proliferation (BMC Genomics 2005; Nuc Acid Res 2006; J Biol Chem 2006).  A germline activating mutation in NRAS was discovered to cause autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome (PNAS 2007). This finding suggested that RAS-inactivating drugs might be therapeutically useful in human autoimmune disorders.  The innate and adaptive immune response to Pneumocystis was characterized in wild type and CD40-ligand knockout mice (J Leukoc Biol 2008).  A focused mitochondria/metabolism/inflammation microarray was used to study HIV-associated myopathy/fatigue (Biol Res Nurs 2008; J Infect Dis 2012; Biol Res Nurs 2013). Genome-wide microarrays uncovered the importance of leptin and the thermogenic glycerolipid/fatty acid cycling pathway in protecting the heart from diet-induced steatosis (Physiological Genomics 2011).  Microarrays were also used to globally examine the ability of carbon monoxide, an endogenous messenger produced by heme oxygenase, to suppress LPS-mediated gene induction in human monocytes (PLoS One 2009).   Other studies examined endothelial progenitor cells (Arteriosclerosis Thrombosis and Vascular Biology 2009), animal strain effects on PBMC gene expression in a rat model of acute cardiac rejection (BMC Genomics 2009), and differences between CD4+ and CD8+ effector T cells in antitumor immunity (PNAS 2009).  Targeted studies of specific inflammatory responses investigated gene regulation mediated by leukotriene D(4) activation of the type I cysteinyl leukotriene receptor (J Allergy Clin Immunol 2008) and the redundancy of leukotriene B(4) and D(4) signaling (Allergy 2011) in human monocytes.  In air-liquid interface differentiated normal human bronchial epithelial cells challenged with IFN, O2 (70%) and NO (40 ppm), two gases used in the management of ARDS, produced highly similar signatures of oxidant stress, possibly explaining the lack of benefit from NO despite its ability to lower O2 requirements (American Thoracic Society abstract 2011). Specific miRNAs in human airway epithelial cells were found to control gene and protein expression important for differentiation (Am J Respir Cell Mol Biol 2013).  Dendritic cells (DCs) comprise distinct populations with specialized immune-regulatory functions.  Retinoic acid (RA), a vitamin A derivative, was found to control the homeostasis of dendritic cell (DC) precursors. Total body radiation in patients and mice led to a selective loss of RA-dependent DC subsets and impaired class II restricted auto and antitumor immunity that could be rescued by supplemental RA (J Exp Med 2013).  Global gene-expression changes across multiple organs implicated a host-wide IFN-response in staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB)-induced death. Therapies aimed at IFN-associated innate immunity may improve outcome in toxic shock syndromes (PLoS One 2014).  After cord blood/haploidentical transplantation, engraftment of donor cells with germ-line integration of HHV6 mimics HHV6 reactivation (Blood 2014).  Circulating endothelial cells (CECs) have been proposed as a biomarker of vascular injury. CECs were identified by flow cytometry and their endothelial phenotype was validated using ultramicro analytical immunochemistry. Most CECs in healthy individuals are senescent without an identifiable nucleus and lack sufficient RNA for transcriptomal analysis (Thrombosis and Haemostasis 2014).  Loss-of-function mutations in BMPR2 are the most common cause of heritable PAH. BMPR2-silenced human pulmonary artery endothelial cells (PAECs) linked oncogenic Ras/Raf/ERK signaling to phenotypic changes including proliferation, invasiveness and cytoskeletal abnormalities. Therapeutics targeting non-canonical Ras/Raf/ERK signaling may be useful in preventing or reversing vascular remodeling in patients with PAH (Am J Physiol Lung Cell Mol Physiol. 2016).  In human endothelial cells, MR agonists were found to repress NF-kB mediated gene transcription (Keystone Symposia on Nuclear Receptors abstract 2010; American Thoracic Society abstract 2010). In contrast, MR either repressed or further activated AP1 signaling depending on the DNA sequence of specific AP1 binding sites, MR ligand structure, and AP1 family member expression. Global expression profiling identified target genes that were trans-activated by this MR/AP1-dependent pro-inflammatory mechanism (J Biol Chem 2016).  The comparative biology of the many genomic mutations associated with the development of PAH has the potential to identify both individualized and possibly universal therapeutic targets aimed at halting or even reversing the progression of pathologic vascular remodeling. In addition to genome-wide expression profiling studies of BMPR2-, CAV1-, and SMAD9-silenced primary, human pulmonary artery endothelial cells, techniques are being developed to produce induced pluripotent stem cells (iPS) from PAH patient-derived fibroblasts and peripheral blood. CRISPR/CAS9 is also being explored as a means to create or repair specific PAH-associated genetic defects in selected cell types. Emerging areas of interest for better understanding PAH pathogenesis include oncogenic signaling, inflammation and pseudohypoxia.  Transcriptomic and morphologic analyses of heterotopic hearts in a rat cardiac transplant model demonstrated significant mitochondrial injury during acute cardiac rejection with downregulation of mitochondrial energetics (ISHLT abstract 2017)."
"9481369","ABSTRACT  Relationships between viruses and DNA damage response (DDR) in host are well described and show that viruses modulate cell metabolism and interact with cellular mechanisms to activate or deactivate different pathways in DNA damage repair. Cells with affected DNA repair pathway were shown to be more vulnerable to targeting DDR causing increases in DNA damage to the level that trigger apoptosis. There is growing evidence that HIV-1 influence DDR during active infection, however, nothing is known about DDR in HIV-1 reservoirs, where virus remains latent. We showed for the first time that latently infected cells exhibit deficiencies in DDR, indicating that HIV-1 latency have influence on host ability to efficiently respond to DNA damage. We also found that latent cells are more susceptible to the agent inducing double strand breaks (DSBs). Moreover, exposing latently infected cells to agents targeting telomeres caused increases in the rate of apoptosis. Thus, we propose to investigate a hypothesis that latently infected cells have an impaired DDR, and that this deficiency can be efficiently targeted to cure HIV. In Aim 1, we will determine the susceptibility of the latently infected central memory T-cells to DNA damage-inducing agents. Whereas, in Aim 2, we will investigate the role of specific DDR proteins and viral proteins in sensitizing latently infected memory T-cells to DNA damage. These aims will be undertaken by a strong multidisciplinary team of investigators who has proven expertise in HIV latency, biochemistry and cell biology, and a history of productive collaboration to successfully complete these investigations. Moreover, proposed studies will leverage research infrastructure offered by the University of Rochester Center for AIDS Research (UR-CFAR). Our proposal is innovative because it investigates the sensitivity of latently infected cells to DNA damage-inducing agents, which will break new ground explaining previously unrecognized functional consequences of latency in both health and disease. This study is significant because revealing the DDR mechanisms affected by HIV will provide a critical basic science foundation to understand how these molecular pathways function in latently infected cells, while providing insight into how targeting them could eliminate HIV reservoirs without viral reactivation. The results obtained in these studies are expected to exert a high impact on HIV/AIDS field on three counts: 1) by advancing scientific knowledge and revealing how HIV impairs DDR in memory T-cells, which will propel further investigations into the mechanisms that can be exploited for effective cure, 2) by promoting novel methodologies, and 3) by validating disease-modifying therapeutic targets, which are also viable in other viral infections."
"9591851","DESCRIPTION: Infection with HIV-1 can induce dementia for which a treatment is currently not available. Experimental evidence from our and other laboratories strongly suggests that HIV-1 infection and neurotoxic stimulation of microglia and macrophages (M?) in the brain trigger neuronal damage and impairment of neurogenesis. We recently observed that mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) p38 was required in both M?/microglia for induction of HIV/gp120 toxicity and in neurons for initiation of apoptosis by M? toxins. In follow-up studies we found that knockdown of p38? MAPK by specific siRNAs down-regulated cysteinyl leukotriene synthase (LTC4S) in M?. We also discovered that blockade of the cysteinyl-leukotriene receptor 1 (CysLTR1) protected cerebrocortical neurons against toxicity of gp120-stimulated or HIV-infected M?. Therefore, we propose to study in vivo how genetic deletion of LTC4S or blockade of CysLTR1 affects brain injury caused by HIV-1 or its envelope gp120. We hypothesize that ablation of CysLT production or CysLTR1 inhibition can prevent HIV and gp120 from inducing neuronal injury and behavioral impairment. The long-term objectives are to find new protective strategies against brain injury by HIV infection. The specific aims (SA) are: (1) To determine in vivo whether genetic deletion of cysteinyl-leukotriene synthase (LTC4S) prevents neuronal injury and behavioral impairment in a HIV/gp120 transgenic mouse model. (2) To investigate in vivo whether pharmacological inhibition of CysLTR1 ameliorates neuronal damage in a HIV/gp120 transgenic mouse model. (3) To assess in vitro how the blockade of CysLTR1 or knockout (KO) of LTC4S enables neuronal survival in the presence of HIV-induced macrophage toxins. Transgenic mice expressing HIV/gp120 will be cross-bred with LTC4SKO animals (SA1) and Montelukast will be used to block CysLTR1 (SA2). Memory and cognition-based behavioral performance, neuronal injury and glial cell activation will be compared in LTC4SKO versus wild-type and Montelukast- versus vehicle-treated HIV/gp120-transgenic mice for SA1 and 2, respectively. For SA3, we will use pharmacological inhibition of CysLTR1 besides LTC4SKO and wild-type cerebrocortical neurons and astrocytes exposed to conditioned media of HIV-infected and un-infected, primary human M?. All three SAs will employ multi-dimensional mass spectrometry-based shotgun lipidomics to profile CysLTs in comparison to other cellular lipids and mediators in different parts of the brain (SA1 and 2) and neurons, astrocytes and M? (SA3). For all three SAs neuronal injury and death will be analyzed by deconvolution microscopy after immunolabeling for neuronal cellular and synaptic markers and staining of nuclear DNA by Hoechst dye. All three Specific Aims will test the premise that deletion of CysLT production or blockade of CysLTR1 prevents inflammatory and injurious processes in favor of neuroprotective mechanisms, such as reduced activity of p38 MAPK and Caspase 3, and increased activity of Akt,. We will also assess in vivo whether LTC4SKO and CysLTR1 blockade can preserve memory and cognition and ameliorate gliosis in the presence of HIV/gp120."

In addition, the BIC provides integrated laboratory information management systems (LIMS), which harbor research information portals shared among multiple core facilities (e.g., Functional Genomics and Genomic Sequencing, Drug Discovery and Structural Biology, Analytical Cytometry, Small Animal Imaging, and the developing Proteomics and Translational Research cores). The BIC also provides researchers with high-throughput biological data analysis, including integration with high-quality publicly available multi-disease, multi-cohort gene expression datasets. With highly-trained staff working in multidisciplinary teams, the BIC facilitates experimental design, QC/QA, data analysis, integration, annotation, dissemination, visualization and training for researchers. A new subscription-based chargeback policy was implemented in 2009 to offer tiered services to COHCCC members to be included in their grant proposals for adequate chargeback. The usage has nearly doubled from 45 subscribers in 2008 to 78 in 2010, and chargeback revenue has tripled from $46,487 in 2008 to $141,078 in 2010. Between 2007 and 2011, the BIC was used by a total of 88 principal investigators, 67 of whom are COHCCC members, and BIC staff collectively co-authored 52 peer-reviewed publications. The BIC's ongoing goal is to foster comprehensive bioinformatics support for researchers to enable collaborations among, basic, translational, clinical and population sciences researchers."
"9555568","In the past year, we have completed several studies related to cardiovascular biomarkers and have published the findings (see below).  We have focused on the use of the NMR device in DLM for performing a detailed  assessment of lipoprotein particle number and size, which has led to several publications on cardiovascular risk markers mostly in collaboration with NIH intramural investigators.   In terms of work in progress, we are currently working under a CRADA with the NMR manufacturer for improving the algorithm for measuring lipoproteins.  We have recently modified the algorithm to detect an abnormal lipoprotein particle called LpX, which accumulates in patients with liver disease and genetic disorders of HDL metabolism.  We plan to prepare publication on new method for LpX determination in coming year."
"9404592","Project Summary Voice disorders are debilitating and can lead to significant socioemotional consequences, loss of income, and long-term disability. Among otolaryngology evaluations for dysphonia, iatrogenic etiologies (most consequent from thyroidectomy or anterior cervical disc fusion surgery) account for an estimated 50% new cases of unilat- eral vocal fold paralysis (UVFP) annually. The symptomatic burden of UVFP on patients is significant with an estimated 100% of identified cases experiencing dysphonia, 60% dyspnea, and 75% dysphagia, which, in severe cases, can lead to aspiration pneumonia and death. Treatment requires medialization of the paralyzed vocal fold to reestablish glottal closure. Several modalities exist to achieve closure, including in- jection augmentation. However, injection augmentation is effective at only temporarily alleviating symptoms, and surgical intervention is ultimately necessary in more than half of patients diagnosed with UVFP (Francis et al. 2016). Permanent framework surgery remains the gold standard for patients that are beyond the period of spontaneous recovery (usually 6-12 months). The current proposal focuses specifically on framework surgery, of which type I laryngoplasty is most common. Indications for this procedure extend well beyond UVFP to in- clude a growing population of patients with glottal insufficiency from other causes (e.g., presbyphonia). Alt- hough these patients benefit from type I laryngoplasty, surgical techniques and revision rates vary widely and are largely volume-dependent and experiential. Unfortunately, such variation produces inconsistent and unde- sirable clinical outcomes. Thus, there exists a significant need for a clinical tool to assist surgeons with pre- operative planning and to improve patient outcomes. To address this need, we have assembled a multidis- ciplinary group of engineers, scientists, and surgeons to work towards a patient-specific surgical planning tool for type I laryngoplasty (PhonoSim). It is envisioned that a tool that incorporates the surgical implant, and captures the individual-specific features of the patient?s laryngeal anatomy can be used in surgical planning to optimize the shape, size, and position of implants used in type I laryngoplasty to improve clinical outcomes. This proposal leverages current advances in microimaging, computational modeling, and high-performance computing of biological systems to support the development and validation of a surgical planning tool for type I laryngoplasty. Our preliminary work has focused on: 1) development of a versatile computational approach for the simulation of 3D fluid-structure interactions involving large defor- mations, and 2) validation of computational models of phonation and for the first time the modeling of subject- specific vibratory characteristics. The goal of this proposal is to empirically test the modeling and validation ap- proaches developed in our preliminary work to produce a clinical tool to be used in future human studies. The deliverable upon grant completion will be a clinical tool to be rigorously tested in future phase I/II human trials."
"9468289","Project Summary/Abstract  Our long term goal is to understand the pathogenesis of a novel neurodegenerative disease in a family harboring a previously undescribed mutation. This family is afflicted with frontotemporal dementia (FTD), inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern. The neuropathology associated with this mutation is comprised of cytoplasmic vacuolization of neocortical neurons and Alzheimer?s disease-like tau protein aggregation. This pathology differs from any pathology described in the literature. Furthermore, this mutation represents the only FTD causing mutation associated with tau pathology outside of mutations in the tau gene itself. The first step in understanding the pathogenesis of this novel neurodegenerative disease is to understand the biochemical effect of this mutation. We hypothesize that this mutation disrupts critical protein structure leading to protein loss-of-function. Specific Aim 1 will determine the biochemical structure of this mutant protein. We will use a combination of computational modeling and fluorometric imaging to understand how this mutation differs from wild type and other disease associated mutants of this protein. Specific Aim 2 will determine the biochemical function of this mutant protein. We will use biochemical assays to characterize the enzymatic activity, substrate binding profile, and interaction with pathologic tau fibrils. Through our studies, we will begin to understand the pathogenesis of this novel neurodegenerative disease and gain insight on a new mechanism for Alzheimer?s disease pathology."

"9572255","HIFU projects: The studies being carried out using high intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) involve a unique variety of novel applications for drug delivery, cancer therapy, ablation, (and in the past, fibroid therapies and thrombolysis). Building a foundation for these clinical applications necessitates directed pre-clinical safety and bridging studies that are requisite to bring drug-plus-device paradigms to clinical practice. The optimization of techniques and technologies for uterine fibroid image guided ablation was the first clinical trial for this technology at NIH CC, and was the first USA install of one of the new MRI-guided HIFU technologies that uses MRI temperature maps to localize where the energy is deposited, with a real-time closed loop feedback algorithms that help the physician prescribe and control the energy delivery. This novel technology is also delivered volumetrically and does not require linear sequential rastering, as did the predicate technology. Cavitation detection further improves the safety of this approach. The new clinical HIFU system can apply HIFU very rapidly, which mitigates the excessive time requirements for prior HIFU technologies, which was a major barrier to clinical translation. New tools developed here include programming to enable volumetric hyperthermia and volumetric drug delivery.  1. Enhanced local drug deposition using low temperature sensitive liposomes (LTSLs): In preclinical models, we have shown that local doxorubicin delivery is enhanced in both tumors and muscle by combining systemic injections of LTSLs containing the drug and HIFU exposures. In the tumor studies, enhanced delivery was compared to non-thermo sensitive liposomes and shown to produce improved anti-tumor effects. Low energy HIFU exposures are tailored to generate temperature elevations that are just a few degrees Celsius above body temperature, which are non-destructive, and which cause a phase transition in the liposomes making them more permeable and able to release their payload. The image guided hyperthermia enhances permeability and perfusion as well. A multi-disciplinary approach optimizes these treatments for improving spatial and temporal heating using computer simulations, in vitro experimentation, and in vivo studies. Collaborations with Dieter Haemmerich are developing a multi-parametric mathematical model that combines finite element analysis tools with perfusion modeling, tissue bioheat effects and known drug profiles to try to optimize the drug-plus-device approach prior to translation. Enhanced local drug deposition occurs through non-destructive and destructive mechanisms. Thermal ablation also deposits heat that adds to enhanced permeability and retention as well as mechanical deployment of heat-sensitive nanoparticles. Phase I clinical trials for bone and soft tissue painful tumors are at the IRB review stage. Preclinical work has focused on development of image-able nanoparticle agents that could theoretically define volumetric drug dosimetry, thus defining tumor at risk for undertreatment. This preclinical drug paintbrush tool will facilitate and expedite the intricate integration of this drug + device combination.  2. Induced effects for enhancing immunotherapy of tumors: Various studies have shown that HIFU ablation can enhance adaptive immunity against tumors. It is hypothesized that in addition to destroying tumor tissue, tumor associated antigens are being released that can stimulate the immune system to create these effects. With NCI MOB collaborators, we published on the immunogenic effects of radiofrequency thermal ablation, and aim to study further translational opportunities to enhance immunotherapies for cancer.  3. Enhanced pharmacologic thrombolysis: HIFU and non focused ultrasound itself can enhance thrombolysis as has been shown in our in vitro, small animal, and large animal models. Work is submitted on heat sensitive encapsulated liposomal thrombolytics, that could be deployed with HIFU.    4. Safety: Studies on the safety and predictability of clinical HIFU exposures with radiology - pathology correlation where possible or correlation with pain control and duration of response. HIFU exposures can produce a variety of effects for both adjunct and stand alone treatments.  5. Fibroid Ablation: Radiology to pathology correlation for Phase I clinical trial was completed for the use of MRI-guided Spiral volumetric closed loop feedback HIFU for the treatment of uterine fibroids as a pilot trial.  6.  Cancer applications:  Protocols to study  HIFU for painful bone metastases  as well as MRI-guided HIFU + heat deployed chemotherapy in a nanoparticle liposomal vector delivered IV, and plans are ongoing for clinical translation of laparoscopically and robotically delivered HIFU. Devising a methodology for combining HIFU with other accepted interventional oncology regional and local therapies is a future goal. Image-able liposomes that deploy chemotherapy have been shown in vivo to be able to deposit drug focally with image guidance, like a drug paintbrush. 7. HIFU as a local therapy for prostate cancer has been investigated in animal models here at NIH, and has been translated to clinic by collaborators in Dallas, TX.  8. A UO1 grant has recently been approved to evaluate HIFU for pediatric solid tumors with collaborators at Childrens National Medical Center 9.

"9390798","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Stressful life events promote anxiety and hypertension and significantly increase the risk for cardiovascular disease which the leading cause of death in the U.S. Developing strategies that limit stress responding to prevent affective and cardiovascular disorders is the long-term goal of this project. Anxiety, hypothalamic pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis dysfunction and enhanced cardiovascular reactivity to stress contribute to the onset of affective and cardiovascular disorders and limiting these indices of stress responding may be therapeutic. Oxytocin (OT) is being used to treat stress-related disorders; however, activation of oxytocin receptors (OTRs) can have diverse effects, and consequently, identifying specific OTRs regulating stress responding may improve treatments. Magnocellular OT neurons are excited by hypernatremia, increases in the plasma sodium concentration (pNa+), and this results in long-lasting increases in central levels of OT. Driving endogenous OT release by elevating the pNa+ in rodents causes activation of OTRs that inhibit corticotropin-releasing-factor (CRF) neurons in the central amygdala (CeA) and paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN). These neurons are implicated in the etiology of anxiety and hypertension, and intriguingly, OTR mediated inhibition of CRF neurons decreased anxiety-like behavior, blunted HPA activation and attenuated cardiovascular responses to stress. Determining the neural mechanism(s) by which this occurs is the main objective of this proposal. In this regard, hypernatremia interacts with stress to increase neuronal activation in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) and the lateral ventral septum (LVS), which express OTRs and connect to brain regions mediating stress responding. Ongoing studies suggest that OTR expressing neurons in the BNST and LVS project to the CeA or function as GABAergic interneurons. These results suggest that hypernatremia activates magnocellular oxytocinergic neurons that release OT in the BNST and LVS, stimulating OTRs expressed on GABAergic neurons that inhibit CRF neurons, thereby attenuating anxiety, HPA activation and cardiovascular responses to stress. Aim 1 will use mice with OTR-specific Cre expression, neuroanatomical tract-tracing and in vitro patch-clamp electrophysiology to test the hypothesis that magnocellular OT neurons send axons that depolarize neurons in the BNST and LVS by activating OTRs. Aim 2 will utilize Cre-inducible adenoassociated virus (AAV) and optogenetics to test the hypothesis that neurons expressing OTRs in the BNST and LVS have GABAergic efferents that inhibit CRF neurons in the CeA and PVN. Aim 3 will delete OTRs in the BNST and LVS of mice to test the hypothesis that these receptors mediate the stress dampening effects of hypernatremia. Completion of these experiments will determine the specific population of OTRs that are activated by endogenously released OT to limit stress responding, thereby producing important information that may guide the development of therapeutics for comorbid affective and cardiovascular disorders."
"9402663","Arthralgia broadly impacts quality of life because of joint dysfunction and associated pain. Current therapeutics improve management of the arthritic joint but may not satisfactorily address the associated pain. The K/BxN serum transfer model of arthritis produces a long lasting, but reversible inflammation of the joint in mice accompanied by an early onset allodynia that surprisingly persists long after the resolution of inflammatory indices. In the early phase of the model, pain behavior responds to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and agents that block spinal sensitization (e.g. Gabapentin), while in the post-inflammatory late phase, pain only responds to the latter agents. This behavioral profile is accompanied by a persistent activation of dorsal horn microglia and the appearance of activation transcription factor 3 (ATF3), a marker of afferent injury in the dorsal root ganglia (DRG), in males and females, suggesting a transition in both sexes from an inflammatory to a neuropathic phenotype. Unexpectedly, the female, despite evidence of nerve injury, does not display a comparable late phase pain state. Pharmacological studies and studies with mutant mice have revealed several issues. 1) Transition to a neuropathic phenotype is modulated by spinal Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) signaling and T and/or B cells evidenced by resolution of pain in relevant knock out strains. In females that lack T and B cells, resolution of allodynia is largely unaffected. 2) Our work indicates that TLR4 signaling, largely through MyD88 is associated with concurrent activation of proinflammatory (TNF) signaling in males leading to a persistent post inflammatory neuropathic pain state. 3) TLR4 also signals though TRIF and interferon (IFN), which we found to attenuate the algesic effects of TLR4-MyD88 signaling. We speculate that this component accounts for the lack of a late phase allodynia in the female. 4) Based on current evidence, we argue that with persistent, but reversible inflammation, sprouting and neuroma like structures in primary afferents and postganglionic sympathetic efferents occur at the peripheral terminals of the joint and the dorsal root ganglion of the K/BxN male and female. This sprouting is driven by TLR4, which activates inflammatory cells and DRG satellite cells to release growth factors, which trigger/sustain sprouting and promote migration of nerve fibers into the DRG and spinal cord. 5) Involvement of spinal TLR4 in pain processing was suggested to be male specific, and females to preferentially use adaptive immune cells (T/B lymphocytes). We believe however, that both sexes use adaptive immune cells and TLR4 signaling, but to varying degrees. The effects of sex on this transition and the underlying sprouting have not hitherto been characterized. Specifically, these studies using the K/BxN model in males and females will characterize time dependent changes in pain, sprouting (afferent and sympathetic in DRG and ankle), inflammatory cell migration into DRG and spinal cord, glial activation and the role played by sex, TLR4 signaling and T/B cells in these endpoints."

"9602242","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Treatment failure and relapse in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is promoted by bone marrow stromal cells that provide growth stimulation under steady-state conditions and anti-apoptotic signals when the ALL cells are treated with chemotherapy. In the previous period of support, this project has made significant advances in understanding how ALL cells respond when they are simultaneously challenged by drug treatment and provided with stromal support. Modification of cell surface molecules through sialylation regulates interactions of immune cells with the microenvironment and modulates signal transduction strength. Our preliminary studies show abnormally high levels of sialic acid 9-O-acetylation on both mouse and human ALL cells, which is consistently and significantly increased as they develop drug resistance. Strikingly, human ALL cells proliferating in the protective bone marrow microenvironment of transplanted mice were eradicated when 9-O-acetylation was removed through activation of a specific esterase that cleaves the R9 acetyl group from sialic acid. We hypothesize that ALL cells generate 9-O-acetylated, sialic acid-modified glycoproteins and glycolipids as a mechanism of protection against spontaneous and drug- induced apoptosis. To address this, Aim 1 will investigate intracellular pathways activated during death due to 9-O-acetylation removal from Sias in pre-B ALL cells, by expression of inducible 9-O-acetyl esterases in human pre-B ALL and mouse wild type and GD3-/- pre-B ALL cells in co-culture with protective stroma. Aim 2 will determine how increased 9-O-acetylation levels of Sias contribute to drug resistance development by comparing drug sensitivity and resistance in pre-B ALL cells with different 9-O-acetylated sialic acid levels in vitro and in mous models. The specific contribution of GD3 will be examined in st8sia1-/- pre-B ALL cells. Aim 3 will determine how acetylation of Sias changes the reactivity of sialoglycoproteins or of GD3 to a conformation favorable for ALL cell survival. The effect of the oxidative state of GD3 on its pro-apoptotic activity will be evaluated in st8sia1-/- pre-B ALL cells that lack endogenous GD3. We will also characterize critical sialoglycoproteins that are 9-O-acetylated in human and mouse ALL cells for subcellular location, induction kinetics upon drug treatment and development of drug resistance using the C. antennarius lectin that specifically detects this modification. Immunoaffinity purification and mass spectrometry will be used to identify the core proteins that are modified by 9-O-acetyl sialylation and are upregulated as ALL cells develop drug resistance in the presence of stromal support in vitro. 9-O-sialylation has not been examined in drug resistance in ALL but our data show it is extremely relevant to their growth and survival. These innovative studies will yield new insight into the mechanisms through which ALL cells withstand drug treatment and lead to novel targets and approaches to treat this and other types of cancer."
"9552558","There are few studies in the literature that examine yoga in minority or diverse populations but none specifically address rheumatic disease.  The goal of this pilot study is to determine the feasibility and acceptability of providing yoga to an urban, minority population with arthritis. Our plan is to use the pilot data from this study to design future yoga interventions in this population.  The protocol was originally approved on 5/22/2012. This study has been closed to accrual as of 6/29/2016, but remains open for data analysis. Thirty-seven (37) subjects were enrolled.   Attending the first yoga class is considered the starting point for the study.  Eighteen (18) RA/OA and three (3) systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) participants met criteria of attending at least one yoga class.  The remaining 16 participants are a combination of those who withdrew, were lost to follow-up or were not able to attend the yoga class times as offered therefore remained in a wait list status.  No further follow-up is required for any participants.     Assessments were made from a convenience sample of participants (with rheumatoid and osteoarthritis) undergoing an 8-week program of yoga classes consisting of 60-minute sessions, twice a week. The yoga classes are designed especially for people with arthritis.  Psychosocial measures were assessed at the beginning of the study and at the completion of taking yoga classes twice a week for 8-weeks. Physical function measures were assessed through NIH Rehabilitation Medicine. For this study self- care is defined as adopting behaviors (regularly doing yoga) that improve physical and mental well-being and may decrease arthritis symptoms and side effects.    Acceptability for this study was evaluated based on the participant narratives, response rate, percent of classes completed, exit interview comments and the percent of patients continuing yoga after 3 months. Qualitative data were analyzed to write the acceptability paper published in 2017.  Quantitative data has been analyzed to assess the feasibility of the study.  Field notes were kept to monitor/document related to issues such as site capability (location/space), personnel (bilingual yoga teachers/investigators), equipment (computers/yoga props), and the amount of modifications needed.  A record was kept of eligible patients who declined and reasons for declining.  A journal article was submitted in 2017 and is currently under review. An abstract relating the experience of enrolling patients with SLE onto the study was accepted for an oral presentation to the American Public Health Association in November 2017."
"9549534","Pulmonary arterial hypertension (WHO Group I) is a rare disorder associated with poor survival. Endothelial dysfunction resulting from 1) genetic susceptibility, and 2) a triggering stimulus that initiates pulmonary vascular injury, the two-hit hypothesis, appears to play a central role both in the pathogenesis and progression of PAH. Inflammation appears to drive this dysfunctional endothelial phenotype, propagating cycles of injury and repair in genetically susceptible patients with IPAH and DaPAH. However, despite mounting evidence of vascular inflammation in patients with PAH, detailed phenotypic studies are lacking on the temporal evolution of this process and its contribution to right ventricular (RV) and pulmonary vascular remodeling.  In this protocol subjects are thoroughly characterized by echocardiogram, 6-minute walk, cardiopulmonary stress testing, pulmonary function testing, cardiac CT, advanced cardiac MRI techniques, gene expression profiling, and serum biomarkers. We hypothesize that a detailed characterization of these subjects in conjunction with a more rigorous profile of the temporal evolution of vascular inflammation in PAH and its impact on RV and pulmonary vascular function will add prognostic value to traditional measures of disease severity and suggest novel therapeutic targets for future research.  The protocol was initially approved by the NHLBI IRB in October 2012. Subsequently IRB approval was sought and obtained at collaborating sites and various amendments were brought into alignment at all institutions by summer 2013. In 2013 -15 we established at the NIH a clinical research PAH program consisting of a multidisciplinary medical staff with expertise in cardiology, pulmonary, and critical care as well as a regulatory and research nursing support staff with extensive experience in assuring compliance with clinical protocols while maintaining the highest standards of clinical care.  In 2015-16 reporting period, in collaboration with the Center of Human Immunology at the NIH, we conducted a proteomic profiling study in order to determine the effects of spironolactone on circulating mediators relevant to PAH. Fluorescent bead-based immunoassay (Bio-Plex) was used to measure cytokines in healthy controls (N=24) and PAH subjects (N=55) divided into 3 diagnostic groups (IPAH/Hereditary-PAH, n=26; Connective Tissue Disease Associated-PAH, n=19; and Other n=10 Congenital Heart Disease Associated-PAH, n=7; drug-induced PAH, n=1; hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia-associated PAH, n=1 and porto-pulmonary PAH, n=1). Multiple linear regression models were used to adjust for PAH clinical characteristics: Age, gender, race, NYHA/WHO classification (I/II versus III/IV), 6-minute walk distance (6MWD), prostanoid infusion, current use of  1 PAH-specific therapy, and spironolactone. Circulating cytokine levels were elevated across a diverse sample of PAH patients compared to healthy controls. Functional classification and 6MWD modestly tracked with a subset of the tested cytokines. Current therapies did not appear to influence this inflammatory signature, but confounding clinical comorbidities and the relatively small number of subjects may have hindered our ability to detect PAH-treatment related differences. An abstract from this work entitled Serum Cytokine Profiling in PAH was presented at the 2016 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation 36th Annual Meeting and Scientific Sessions (JHLT 35(4S):S360, 2016).   During the 2016-17 reporting period we entered into a collaboration with the Center for Human Immunology (CHI). We will provide CHI with samples that they will process for markers of inflammation, and whole blood gene expression studies in order to expand our ability to immunophenotype subjects with PAH. We also entered into a collaboration with the Laboratory of Transplantation Genomics (LTG) of the NHLBI to do exploratory studies using cell-free DNA based tools to evaluate the pathogenesis of and injury related to PAH.  The protocol is open for enrollment. Referrals are currently being received from multiple sites. To date (August 2017) 203 charts of potential subjects have been reviewed for this study and 47 subjects have been enrolled."
"9549433","We have developed and evaluated two typing techniques for human Pneumocystis. The first uses tandem repeats that occur in an intron of the MSG gene, as we have previously reported. The second utilizes variation in the Msg gene family. By sequencing multiple MSG genes in a number of human Pneumocystis isolates, we have been able to demonstrate that recombination occurs in human Pneumocystis. These results led to studies that demonstrated that the MSG repertoire in human Pneumocystis is very diverse, while the MSG repertoire in rat and mouse Pneumocystis is identical or very limited among different isolates. Based on these studies, we have developed a restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) typing assay for human Pneumocystis, and have been able to demonstrate substantial diversity among human isolates. Using RFLP analysis, we have been able to demonstrate that all the isolates from an outbreak of PCP in renal transplant patients in Germany appear to be the same strain, indicating that recent infection is important, and that either host- to-host transmission has occurred or that all individuals ere infected from a common source. We subsequently showed that the same isolate was responsible for an outbreak of PCP in renal transplant patients in Zurich, Switzerland, raising the possibility that this strain may be particularly virulent in renal transplant patients. To address this further, we examined samples from an outbreak of PCP in Japan. We found that while a single organism was responsible for the outbreak there as well, it was different from the European strain based on RFLP analysis. We have subsequently analyzed samples from an outbreak in Denmark and were able to show that 3 unique strains were responsible for this outbreak. Each strain was identified over a limited period of time, with 2 of the 3 strains overlapping in time. We are currently analyzing samples from Brest, France, and Bern, Switzerland that are again from outbreaks in renal transplant recipients. Preliminary results suggest that one strain is common to the outbreaks in Brest and Bern, though not all cases were caused by this strain. In addition to RFLP, we are using multi-locus sequence typing (MLST). MLST is the most commonly used method for typing Pneumocystis in other laboratories, and this will allow us to compare the results of these two typing methods. We are also exploring sequencing larger regions of the Pneumocystis genome to be able to better examine the phylogenetic relationships among different isolates. These studies should help to better understand the epidemiology of Pneumocystis infection.  In collaboration with investigators at the Broad Institute and Leidos Biomedical Research, Inc., we have undertaken a project to sequence the genome of Pneumocystis species from different hosts. The major difficulty with this project was obtaining DNA of sufficient purity to allow next generation sequencing, sincethe organism cannot be cultured.    As a first step, we were able to completely sequence the mitochondrial genomes of P. carinii, P. murina, P. jirovecii, and to show that while there is a high level of synteny between the P. carinii and P. murina genomes, P. jirovecii has substantial levels of recombination compared to the other 2 species. In an effort spearheaded by Liang Ma (staff scientist) we have subsequently been able to purify Pneumocystis DNA from infected rat, mouse, and human lungs sufficiently to allow NGS sequencing to generate high quality sequence data that has permitted development of nearly complete draft genomes of all 3 Pneumocystis species (P. carinii, P. murina, P. jirovecii). RNA sequencing in parallel has allowed identification of P. murina and P. carinii transcripts and characterization of the genes encoded by this organism. Through analysis of these data, we have been able to demonstrate that all 3 Pneumocystis  species have a highly condensed genome compared to other fungi, and that Pneumocystis has developed mechanisms  to evade host innate immune responses, including inability to synthesize or degrade chitin, and inability to synthesize high mannose residues on proteins. Pneumocystis has also lost many other functions that highlight the probability that Pneumocystis lives almost exclusively in its hosts lung environment.  We are currently examining genetic variation in isolates of Pneumocystis obtained from a broad range of sources to better understand the level of varaiability that can be seen in genes other than the Msg gene family, and to better understand the evolution of Pneumocystis  species over time.    Availability of these genome should allow us to better understand the biology of this family of organisms, should potentially allow identification of metabolic pathways that need to be complemented to successfully culture the organism, and should facilitate the identification of important antigens and pathogenic factors."
"9393991","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The Tissue and Cell Analysis (TCA) Core provides traditional and cutting-edge technologies necessary for morphological analysis of cells, tissues from experimental animals, and human tissues. Dr. Jerrold Turner, M.D., Ph.D., is a subspecialty-trained GI pathologist who is an expert in routine and advanced imaging approaches and data interpretation. The Co-Director, Dr. Vytas Bindokas, Ph.D., has an extensive understanding of the newest imaging technologies and post-acquisition analytical tools. Together, their complementary skill sets provide users with the guidance needed for effective use of available resources. The TCA is closely aligned with the other Cores of the DDRCC, providing members with the capability of tissue and cell analysis of human and experimental samples derived from their services. The importance of services provided by the TCA Core has only increased in recent years as use of animal models and human specimens has grown exponentially. Tools needed to study these include H&E tissue preparations, simple and complex immunohistochemical stains, and more complicated preparations. The TCA Core also provides a longitudinal array of human specimens that have been well-characterized and preserved, anatomic pathology consultation, instruction in all techniques,(including immunohistochemistry), and specialized guidance specifically related to study of gastrointestinal disease. Slide-scanners can create virtual slides that can be viewed using a computer and virtual microscope software. This makes it possible to preserve the samples for viewing over extended periods of time or to share slides electronically, and greatly simplifies photomicroscopy. In order to study the diverse specimen preparations generated by DDRCC members, the TCA Core provides access to advanced imaging technologies, including superresolution microscopy that makes it possible to overcome the diffraction-limited 250 nm resolution of light microscopy by an order of magnitude. Other tools, including widefield deconvolution, laser scanning confocal, and spinning disk confocal microscopy make it possible to perform intravital imaging of cultured cells and genetically modified animals expressing fluorescent- tagged proteins. These are able to provide previously unattainable views of ongoing pathobiology that allow unprecedented insight into disease mechanisms. Further, as computer power has grown, advanced software that simplifies complex morphometry of enormous 5D (x,y,z,t,?) datasets has become available. The TCA Core has invested in these costly programs and makes their use available to DDRCC members at minimal cost. Perhaps most importantly, the TCA Core provides expert assistance and education in the use of the growing array of routine and highly specialized technologies that are available. This is essential, as the pace of advances makes it difficult for most investigators to be comfortable with or appreciate the benefits of these new tools."
"9549476","Idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension (IPAH), a subgroup of WHO grp 1 PAH, is a rare disorder with severe morbidity and high mortality. There are no routine screening tests or validated markers of disease activity in IPAH, or the broader group of disease associated PAH (DaPAH). Patients can present at advanced stages of disease. The pathogenesis of IPAH and DaPAH remain unclear. Current thinking focuses on a two-hit hypothesis: 1) genetic susceptibility, and 2) a triggering stimulus that initiates pulmonary vascular injury, resulting in endothelial cell (EC) dysfunction.  We hypothesized that circulating ECs (CECs) and/or peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) can be used to define a subset of differentially regulated biomarkers in IPAH and DaPAH that may lead to earlier diagnosis, better methods for assessing responses to therapy, and potentially identify novel targets for future therapeutic interventions.  Endothelial cells shed into the circulation are a valuable source of clinical material for studying diseases characterized by EC dysfunction. However, no clear methodology exists for isolating clinically relevant numbers of CECs. This project used flow cytometry to develop a methodology for isolating relevant numbers of viable CECs from healthy and PAH subjects. In addition, peripheral blood (PB) specimens were obtained for CECs and PBMCs for microarrays from healthy volunteers and IPAH and DaPAH patients. Plasma was also saved for application to cultured microvascular cells.  A subset of subjects had a right heart catheterization to assess pulmonary pressures and to obtain pulmonary blood specimens.  The protocol started actively enrolling in June 2006 and closed to enrollment in 2009 (n=31). Available data suggested there was no trend towards CEC enrichment in pulmonary vein blood compared to PB for both healthy volunteers (4.4 CEC/ml vs. 4.8 CEC/ml) and PAH patients (2.4 CEC/ml vs. 3.0 CEC/ml). There was a trend towards CEC enrichment in pulmonary artery blood compared to PB for both healthy volunteers (13.8 CEC/ml vs. 4.8 CEC/ml) and PAH patients (3.3 CEC/ml vs. 3.0 CEC/ml).  In 2010-11, total RNA was processed from PBMCs for genome-wide expression analysis. An abstract on PBMC differential gene expression patterns in PAH was presented at the American Thoracic Society (ATS) Meeting (AJRCCM 183:A5511, 2011). The patterns reflected both treatment related signatures and underlying disease pathophysiology.  In 2011-2013, using PBMC expression profiles from 10 PAH subjects with 10 age, gender and race matched healthy subjects we identified over 230 differentially regulated genes at a 20% false discovery rate (FDR). Ingenuity Pathway Analysis identified gene signatures for inflammation, cell-to-cell signaling and interaction, cytoskeletal rearrangement, cellular movement, hemostasis and cell death. In vitro data from our collaborating lab showed that spironolactone suppresses phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate-induced (PMA; an AP-1 activator) inflammatory gene transcription in primary human PAECs. To explore the effect of spironolactone on PAH-associated vascular inflammation we conducted a promoter level analysis of the up-regulated genes we identified in PAH subjects. Biobase ExPlain and Transfac bioinformatics software identified activator protein-1 (AP-1) as a key transcriptional regulator. Experiments using PBMCs isolated from healthy subjects and stimulated with PMA demonstrate that spironolactone suppresses these AP-1 inducible, PAH-associated genes in a dose-dependent manner. Similarly, in PBMCs from healthy and PAH subjects, spironolactone strongly suppressed the basal expression of genes that had been upregulated in PBMCs of PAH patients.  In 2011-12 we also continued to develop a bioassay assessing global transcriptomic changes induced by plasma from PAH compared to healthy subjects using Affymetrix oligonucleotide microarrays. Exposure of human PAECs to plasma from 5 PAH subjects compared to 5 matched controls, identified over 300 differentially expressed transcripts at a 10% FDR. We also explored (2012-13) the gene expression changes in cultured human PAECs induced by plasma from PAH subjects and found that 20% of the signature overlapped with the gene expression changes induced following bone morphogeneic protein receptor-2 gene silencing in PAECs. Importantly, over 90% of the overlap was directionally discordant, suggesting circulating factors may work to counter-regulate genotypic and phenotypic abnormalities that drive PAH.  In 2013-14, we expanded our PBMC expression findings, by starting to collect data from all other published human PAH PBMC genome-wide expression profiling studies for subsequent meta-analysis.  In 2014-15 we completed the necessary steps of data collection, annotation and aggregation of all the published human PAH PBMC expression profiling studies, Meta-analysis of all studies comparing gene expression profiles from IPAH and DaPAH patients to healthy subjects identified 579 and 1186 differentially expressed transcripts, respectively, at a 1% FDR. Interestingly, comparing gene expression profiles from IPAH and DaPAH patients yielded no differentially expressed transcripts at a 1% or 5% FDR. Defining a robust genomic signature across multiple PBMC studies may highlight previously unrecognized gene expression patterns.  In 2015-16, we added data from a recently published blood transcriptomic study conducted in chronic respiratory disease patients (n=8 PAH patients) compared to healthy controls (n=28). With the updated data set, we completed further downstream analyses. Differentially expressed genes in PAH previously identified in the literature demonstrated only modest reproducibility, defined as a FDR 10% by meta-analysis. Different bioinformatic approaches consistently identified inflammatory signaling and regulators of cell proliferation as overrepresented pathways among the shared genomic signature in IPAH and DaPAH. An abstract was presented at ATS 2016 (AJRCCM 193: A4619, 2016).  In 2016-17, over 30 differentially expressed genes in the combined PAH cohort were selected for validation using samples from this protocol. Importantly, over 900 genes identified by meta-analysis were not previously reported in the 7 published studies. Functional analysis of the 1269 differentially expressed genes derived from the combined PAH cohort identified several inflammatory signaling pathways as significantly overrepresented. Among these EIF2 and mTOR signaling have recently been linked to PAH pathogenesis demonstrating the validity of our meta-analytic approach. We also found that in circulating immune cells interferon plays a prominent role in the inflammatory component of PAH pathobiology. Next we performed a gene set analysis using data from all 22753 genes included in the meta-analysis without using arbitrary gene selection criteria. The analysis further supported the prominence of interferon signaling in circulating immune cells of PAH patients. Lastly we conducted a promoter-level analysis to determine if there was enrichment for specific transcription factor binding sites in the upregulated genes from the combined PAH cohort. The upregulated genes were compared to a group of genes that were not differentially regulated between PAH and healthy subjects. The results show highly significant enrichment of binding sites for the interferon regulatory factor family of transcription factors among the upregulated PAH genes. Project data was presented at the 2017 American College of Cardiology Annual Scientific Session as an invited talk entitled Genomics: Meta-Analysis of Blood Expression Profiling Studies in PAH. The protocol remains open to continue bioinformatic analyses of gene expression data, complete downstream in vitro work and finish the meta-analysis of the PAH PBMC expression profiling."
"9549491","Part 1 of this study has been completed. Over the past year, we have continued to develop the necessary technical skills in rodent cardiac catheterization and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging. We have implemented cardiac resonance imaging as part of the protocol instead of echocardiography in order to improve both the resolution and precision of our assessments of right ventricular function. Part 2 of the study, determining the effects of spironolactone versus eplerenone, began in May 2017 and we have completed the first set of experiments."
"9549485","Last year we amended the protocol to improve the pace of patient recruitment. The first change allows for the use of nasopharyngeal (NP) wash as an alternative to NP swab to collect upper airway specimens. NP wash may be better tolerated than NP swab and is routinely used during patient care at the NIH Clinical Center. The second change allows for use of NP wash specimens collected up to 24 hours preceding a clinically indicated bronchoscopy. This change eliminates the need for repeat upper airway sampling in a subset of patients.  Up to 100 male or female subjects age 12 and above who are already undergoing bronchoscopy for the collection of a BAL specimen and who will have respiratory virus PCR ordered on the BAL specimen as part of their ongoing care at the NIH Clinical Center will be eligible for inclusion in this study.  NP swab and wash specimens have been validated for testing using the FilmArray assay. Both the NP swab/wash and the BAL specimens will have the respiratory virus PCR (FilmArray) assay ordered in CRIS and the specimens will be processed and tested by the medical technologists in the Microbiology Service of the Department of Laboratory Medicine. Results from both specimens will be reported in CRIS. Instructions from the Centers for Disease Control on the proper technique for collecting NP swab specimens are presented in Appendix A. To resolve discrepant results, NP (swab or wash) and BAL specimens with conflicting results will be tested by a second multiplex PCR (Luminex Fast RVP) in the Laboratory of Infectious Diseases, Viral Pathogenesis and Evolution Branch, NIAID. These results will only be used for research purposes.  Demographic and clinical data (including but not limited to laboratory results, microbiologic data, and radiology results) on study participants will be abstracted from CRIS and correlated with results from the FilmArray assay. Excess NP swab/wash or BAL samples will be stored for potential future use by study investigators.  To date we have enrolled 35 subjects. The results thus far:  21 had negative results for respiratory virus PCR  14 had positive results for respiratory virus PCR  Of the 14 positive results:  11 had matching viral results from BAL and NP swab  1 showed positive results from BAL and NP swab identifying different pathogens  2 showed positive respiratory virus PCR on BAL only.  In April 2017, we changed the status of this protocol to Open for Data Analysis Only."
"9404358","Project Summary/Abstract: Trace Elements (TE) Shared Resource  The Trace Element (TE) Shared Resource is a specialized facility dedicated to determining trace element  concentration, and form of trace elements, in a wide variety of biological and environmental media. The  chemistry of inorganic elements inextricably is linked with the study of cancer. Whether determining the fate  and effects of known carcinogens (such as arsenic), the potential antagonistic effects of elements (such as  selenium), or the therapeutic effects of platinum or Fe nanoparticles, there is a clear need for routine advanced  trace element analytical methods to support cancer research. The critical nature of these services for the  Norris Cotton Cancer Center (NCCC) research program has led to designation of TE as an NCCC-supported  Shared Resource and to a request for future CCSG funding. In the TE core, Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass  Spectrometry (ICP-MS) methodologies have been developed to provide analysis of trace metals in solids,  solution, blood, and toenails. TE services include arsenic speciation in solutions, mercury speciation in  solution, and ICP-MS tuning and operation for routine analysis. There have been notable examples of cancer  research using TE resources. For example, the TE core developed innovative methods for determining  Arsenic species in rice, juice, and toddler formulae. Also TE-developed spatial analyses show the distribution  of a trace element within tissue sections, which is determined 'in situ' at pre-determined resolution, creating a  2-dimensional elemental image map from biological thin sections using laser ablation-ICP-MS. Using this  technology, the TE core developed methods for detecting Fe, Cu, and Zn in rat brain sections. Analytical  expertise is provided by the TE Core Director and a staff consisting of a PhD level scientist and an advanced  Research Technician. The TE core has collaborated with NCCC researchers in 5 of the NCCC Programs  (Cancer Epidemiology, Cancer Mechanisms, Molecular Therapeutics, Cancer Imaging & Radiobiology, and  Immunology & Cancer Immunotherapy) to determine the concentration or form of trace elements in biological  samples."
"9563636","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The genes encoded by our DNA form the template for the RNA and proteins that make up our cells and tissues and allow them to carry out their normal functions. However, not all of our DNA is expressed simultaneously by every cell. Epigenetic regulation changes the packaging and handling of DNA, providing genetically identical cells the ability to produce dramatically different patterns of gene expression. It allow for cells and tissues to silence the genes they don't need, and activate the genes they do. Now, advances in sequencing technologies are revealing that epigenetic regulators are among the most frequently altered genes in cancer. In many cancers, these epigenetic regulators do not function properly, often as a result of mutations in their DNA sequence. Our group and others have identified Multiple Myeloma SET domain-containing protein (MMSET) as an important epigenetic regulator in cancer. In normal cells, MMSET modifies the packaging of DNA in specific chromosomal regions to activate expression of genes. However, in many cancers, changes in the MMSET gene result in increased production of MMSET, which can cause increased cell growth and is associated with poor patient prognosis. Recently, a hyperactive form of MMSET was detected in several cancers of lymphoid cells, including relapsed pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), and mantle cell lymphoma (MCL). This hyperactive form is generated by a single mutation at position 1099 in the MMSET gene (MMSET E1099K). However, the biological function of MMSET E1099K in cancers is not fully understood. We hypothesize that the E1099K mutation leads to alterations in DNA packaging and handling, which results in changes in gene expression and in turn drives progression of lymphoid malignancies. We will test this hypothesis by examining the gene expression changes and biological consequences of the MMSET E1099K mutant in ALL and MCL cells and in mice. The mouse mutant will also help us learn how MMSET collaborates with other important drivers of cancer pathology. These studies will further our knowledge of lymphoid malignancy progression, as well as help us learn how to best design cancer therapies to target epigenetic dysregulation generated by MMSET E1099K."

"9549422","We have an ongoing project to characterize the antigens of mouse, rat, and human Pneumocystis.  We have previously purified the major surface glycoprotein (MSG) of both rat and human pneumocystis using HPLC.  It is necessary to use Pneumocystis from both sources because the organisms are different species.  Subsequently, we identified a number of clones from a cDNA library of rat Pneumocystis that contain genes encoding for the MSG.  These clones were clearly related but not identical, demonstrating that multiple genes encode the MSG.  We have continued studies to characterize potential antigens of Pneumocystis.  We have cloned a number of human Pneumocystis MSG genes and have expressed a full-length MSG in two fragments.  We developed an ELISA to examine antibody responses to these antigens, and have utilized it to examine sera from patients with or without HIV infection, and with or without a history of PCP, as well as sera from a variety of healthy controls.  In about 15% of healthy patients followed serially we have been able to document changes in antibody titers, suggesting that these individuals have developed reinfection or reactivation of Pneumocystis infection.  We will continue these studies to better understand the epidemiology of Pneumocystis infection in humans.  We have also identified the unique expression site of MSG in human Pneumocystis, and can now identify the MSG variants that are expressed in a patient with PCP.  Within this expression site we have identified a region of tandem repeats that varies among different Pneumocystis isolates, and thus provides a method for typing human Pneumocystis.  We have sequenced MSG variants from a single human pneumocystis isolate and have shown that the isolates can be divided, into 2 subgroups that are genetically distinct.  We have cloned and sequenced MSG variants from additional patients from around the world to see if this will provide information about the distribution of different Pneumocystis strains.  To date we have found substantial variability in MSG variants from different parts of the world, but no clustering by geographic location.  To better examine the MSG repertoire and MSG variability, we have utilized next generation sequencing. By 454 sequencing, we were unable to reconstruct the original sequences using a mixture of plasmids, in large part because of the conserved regions in MSG variants. PacBio sequencing, which allows potentially longer reads, appears to be able to overcome the assembly problem.  We are continuing to evaluate results generated by PacBio sequencing using mouse and human isolates of Pneumocystis.  We have also expressed a p57 protein of P. murina that is predicted to be a surface protein based on a predicted GPI-type anchor.  Based on western blot studies this is an antigen recognized by mouse serum from exposed or infected animals.  We are conducting studies to characterize expression of this protein by Pneumocystis. We have recently sequenced the genomes of 3 Pneumocystis species, and will be using the data from the genomes to identify potential surface proteins that may be antigens, based on the predicted amino acid sequence characteristics.   The goal of this study is to better understand the pathogenesis of Pneumocystis pneumonia with the hope that we can use this information to control or prevent this disease."

"9552570","Bacteria that produce carbapenemases, such as the K. pneumoniae carbapenemase (blaKPC), are increasingly common multidrug resistant pathogens causing nosocomial infections and outbreaks, with high rates of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Horizontal transfer of carbapenemase-producing plasmids is believed to play a significant role in the spread of multidrug resistant K. pneumoniae and other Gram-negative bacteria. Our experiments are aimed at defining the parameters regulating the spread of carbapenem resistance. Patients can be colonized by KPC+ K. pneumoniae for extended periods of time; however, only some of these patients have evidence of blaKPC containing plasmids transferring to bacteria other than Klebsiella species based on our extensive surveillance system. Understanding any differences between in vitro potential to spread and in vivo evidence of spread will aid our attempts to prevent dissemination of the resistance phenotype.  We found that investigators using in vitro models of conjugation should incorporate several parameters before drawing conclusions about a plasmids conjugative ability. Studies utilizing conjugation assays overwhelmingly use only a single assay condition. In vitro and in vivo studies of the same plasmid are often discrepant. Thus, we sought to use an even more accurate system, comparing in vitro data to in situ data, by using environmental and clinical epidemiology. Although this has been attempted previously, other studies typically use a single donor that is representative of an outbreak to a single recipient. In this study, we leverage four donor strains each with a unique molecular epidemiology, and leverage 16 patient isolate recipients not previously available for study. We generated a unique set of reagents through transformation into a plasmid-cured strain that allow for easy separation and testing of donor strain, plasmid, and recipient strain influences.  Our systematic analysis showed that conjugation is heavily context-specific, and is dependent on the donor, recipient, plasmid, and the environment.  The environment as a location for horizontal gene transfer has been examined and discussed, but the full extent and impact from this source of additional resistant strains is not yet known. We also sought to correlate our in vitro data to the epidemiology of blaKPC+ patients from two medical centers. We note that, surprisingly, in vitro conjugation efficiency does not correlate with observed promiscuous interspecies spread.  This is in contract to conclusion of some outbreak papers that suggest horizontal transfer may be of high efficiency between different species of Enterobacteriaceae. Next, we analyzed efficient and refractory recipients by single-molecule, real-time sequencing. We used this whole genome sequence data to generate hypotheses for possible mechanisms that control conjugation, highlighting the complexity of the regulatory system for conjugation.  These studies integrate epidemiology, plasmid biology, and genomics to give novel insights on clinically significant resistant Gram-negative bacteria."

"9552566","Many patients are unable to make medical decisions for themselves (Raymont V, et al 2004; Silveira MJ, et al 2010). Current clinical practice relies on shared decision-making between clinicians and surrogates to make treatment decisions for these patients. This decision-making process is meant to promote medical care that accords with the patients own preferences and values. However, empirical data suggest that this approach faces two significant challenges. First, surrogates and clinicians have trouble predicting which treatment course patients would have chosen. Second, surrogates often experience significant emotional distress as a result of making treatment decisions. To address these concerns it has been suggested that the shared decision-making process might be supplemented with a Patient Preference Predictor (PPP). A PPP would provide a prediction of which treatment a given patient would want based on the treatment preferences of similar patients in similar circumstances. Preliminary research suggests that incorporating a PPP into the shared decision-making process might help to improve the extent to which medical decisions reflect the preferences of decisionally incapacitated patients and alleviate some of the emotional burden felt by surrogates and clinicians. A survey of patients found that, if the use of the PPP would increase the predictive accuracy of the shared decision-making process, a majority of patients believe that incorporating it into the shared decision-making process would be beneficial (Rid et al, 2014). Based on these findings, the present study proposes to interview surrogates who have been involved in making decisions for an incapacitated patient to explore their perspectives on the PPP and how to incorporate it into medical decision-making."
"9562831","Acute and chronic pain are common in children and adolescents and are often associated with severe functional disability and mood disorders.  The pharmacological treatment of chronic pain in children and adolescents can be challenging, ineffective, and is mostly based on expert opinions and consensus.  We are examining new strategies to effectively treat pain in children using mechanistic driven approaches that also decreases opioid requirements.  One such approach is the use ketamine, an N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist, which has been used as an adjuvant to opioids in adult chronic pain and has been shown, in some instances, to improve pain and decrease opioid-requirement.  The use of sub anesthetic ketamine as an analgesic is supported by evidence, both from animal and human studies, implicating activation of NMDA receptors in the pathobiology of nociceptive, inflammatory, and neuropathic pain and in central sensitization.  In addition, activation of NMDA receptors has also been show in animals and in human experimental studies to play a role in settings where acute or chronic use of opioids is associated with tolerance or opioid-induced hyperalgesia.  Therefore, based on these preclinical findings, ketamine has been examined clinically as an adjuvant to opioids for the treatment of acute and chronic pain and in settings of opioid-induced hyperalgesia.  We examined the effects of sub-anesthetic ketamine on pain intensity and opioid use in children and adolescents with acute and chronic pain syndromes treated both in inpatient and outpatient settings.  We have shown that sub anesthetic doses of ketamine can be safely administered to children and adolescents both on an inpatient and outpatient settings, and in low doses it has an acceptable side-effect profile.  Overall, in children with chronic pain, ketamine significantly reduces pain intensity, especially in the setting of complex regional pain syndrome.  However, in patients admitted to the hospital, the effect of ketamine on pain scores varied according to clinical diagnosis, infusion duration, and pain location and greater reductions in pain scores are observed in patients with cancer pain.  Another approach we are also evaluating for the management of acute pain during the perioperative setting is the use of dexmedetomidine, an alpha2-adrenoreceptor agonist with sedative and analgesic properties.  A number of animal studies support the hypothesis that dexmedetomidine may have a role in the treatment of pain.  For example, in neuropathic pain models, the antinociceptive effect of dexmedetomidine appears to be opioid independent and is associated with supraspinal facilitation of inhibitory postsynaptic currents as well as inhibition of sensory neurons from the substance gelatinosa.  In models of visceral pain, dexmedetomidine has antinociceptive effects unrelated to opioid receptor activation and are associated with increased nitric oxide availability.  We have previously shown that in children undergoing tonsillectomies, dexmedetomidine improves pain management and prolongs opioid-free intervals during the immediate post-operative period.  Additionally, in obese adolescents undergoing bariatric surgery, the intraoperative administration of dexmedetomidine decreases opioid utilization during the perioperative period.  Another setting associated with acute and chronic pain in children is that of sickle cell disease.  In the laboratory, we had previously shown that dexmedetomidine ameliorates the altered nociception phenotype in mouse models of sickle cell disease.  We are now examining the role for dexmedetomidine in pain management during vaso-occlusive episodes in sickle cell patient.  We have preliminary findings suggesting possible beneficial effects of dexmedetomidine in decreasing opioid requirements and supporting the hypothesis that dexmedetomidine may have a role as a possible analgesic adjuvant to mitigate vaso-occlusive-episodes-associated pain in patients with sickle cell disease.   Overall we have collected data on the feasibility and safety of new approaches to treat pain in children, such as the administration of sub anesthetic ketamine or the use of an alpha2 agonist, such as dexmedetomidine.  These data will inform the design, sample and effect sizes calculations for the conduct of larger randomized clinical trials to identify pediatric patients who could benefit from those strategies"
"9481697","PROJECT SUMMARY Unintended pregnancies among HIV-positive women have significant consequences for maternal morbidity and vertical transmission of HIV, and contraception prevents unintended pregnancies among the millions of HIV- positive women worldwide. Contraceptive implants are the most effective form of contraception available to HIV- positive in resource-limited settings. Implants, however, when combined with certain antiretroviral therapy (ART) regimens have reduced effectiveness leading to unintended pregnancies. Clinical and pharmacokinetic (PK) data now demonstrate drug-drug interactions between implants and efavirenz dosed at 600mg (EFV600) reducing implant effectiveness. The latest World Health Organization ART guidelines recommend the use of lower dose efavirenz at 400mg (EFV400) and dolutegravir in first line ART globally. Whether the same drug- drug interactions affect implant effectiveness with these newer ART regimens is unknown. Thus, critical gaps exist in current international and national HIV treatment and contraception guidelines regarding the concomitant use of ART and hormonal contraception. This project will close this important knowledge gap by prospectively assessing the PK and pharmacodynamics (PD) effects of EFV400 and dolutegravir on the plasma implant progestins (etonogestrel or levonorgestrel) and endogenous progesterone (a marker of ovulation suppression) concentrations. This proposal leverages an on- going PK study in Kenya evaluating implant progestin concentrations in women using EFV600. A total of 100 women on the different ART/implant combinations will undergo repeated plasma sampling up to 24 weeks after implant placement. Specifically, this project will determine if the PK/PD effects of EFV400 on implant progestin concentrations and proportion of women ovulating differ from those of EFV600 (Aim 1a) and of dolutegravir from EFV600 (Aim 1b). This project will also explore if pharmacogenetics (PG) polymorphisms in CYP450 enzymes known to affect progestin and ART metabolism will influence systemic concentrations of these hormones and ART regimens (Aim 2). This proposal directly addresses emerging concerns that different ART regimens could substantively and differentially impact contraceptive efficacy, and it explores this potential risk when these new regimens are just becoming available. It builds on the existing PK data in this field and expands it with PD and PG information. If our study demonstrates lack of improvement in progestin concentrations with EFV400 from EFV 600 and no effect on progestin concentrations with dolutegravir, these findings would support shifting ART guidelines to recommend dolutegravir-based ART as first-line ART?instead of alternative first-line?for women of reproductive age."
"9390436","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Activation and repression of transcription of protein coding genes is key to all facets of biology. Over the past decade or so, the field has learned a lot about how writing and reading of the epigenetic code, alterations in chromosome conformation and distal enhancers contribute to this regulation. In this regard, we have examined how these elements contribute to activation and repression of the gene that encodes IFN-?, a critical cytokine for function of both innate and adaptive arms of the immune system. More recently the field has learned that much of the genome is transcribed in some cell lineage at some stage in development. Two newly discovered classes of RNA regulatory elements include long non-coding RNAs (lncRNA) and RNAs transcribed from distal enhancers (eRNAs). We identified a lncRNA adjacent to IFNG that activates IFNG transcription. We also identified eRNAs synthesized from IFNG distal enhancers in a Th1/Th2/Th17 lineage and developmental specific context. Here, we propose an integrated set of experiments to understand underlying principles by which lncRNAs contribute to both regulation of genes, IFNG, IL4/L13, IL17a/f, that encode signature cytokines that exemplify Th1/Th2/Th17 lineage commitment and genes encoding the 'master regulators' of this lineage commitment. We believe that examination of these classes of lncRNA, regulators of 'signature gene expression' and of 'master regulators', will identify underlying principles that can be integrated into a greater whole than studies targeting a single effector Th lineage. Our proposal will link functions of lncRNAs, eRNAs, and distal enhancer elements in a murine model system that permits analysis of the evolution of the genomic IFNG locus as T cells differentiate from the naive to effector to memory stage of development. An additional aspect of our studies will focus on genetic polymorphisms that increase risk to develop complex diseases. Genome-wide association studies in human populations have identified numerous single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with risk of developing complex diseases. The vast majority of these disease risk alleles are found in areas of the genome that do not code for proteins. Examples are the four SNPs within the TMEVPG1-IFNG-IL26-IL22 genomic region, three of which are associated with inflammatory bowel diseases. Our studies will focus on the function of these disease risk alleles. We propose that we have a unique understanding of this genomic region and the necessary expertise to undertake these studies. The hypothesis we will test is that presence of these SNPs and the associated co-inherited haplotype blocks alter distal enhancer function to change expression of adjacent protein-coding genes to impact disease. We propose an integrated series of experiments to explore this hypothesis. Not only will these studies increase our understanding of how genetic risk for IBD is conferred, diseases that affects 0.5-1% of the human population, but they will also serve as a general roadmap to address how disease risk alleles located in protein non-coding regions of the genome alter expression of key proteins contributing to disease pathogenesis."
"9443767","Project Summary The incidence of obesity has increased dramatically over the last fifty years. Over half of all Americans are over-weight and over one third are classified as clinically obese. The health ramifications of this epidemic of obesity are seen in the concomitant increase in the incidence of type 2 diabetes. An estimated 29 million Americans have diabetes with 95% of those being type 2. Metformin, the most commonly prescribed therapeutic used to treat the early stages of type 2 diabetes targets the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). Therefore, defining the functions and regulation of AMPK is of great significance to human health. This proposal uses baker's yeast as its model system to study the regulation of the yeast AMPK. In both yeast and human cells, the overall structure of AMPK and the modes of regulation are highly conserved. The speed and synergy of genetic and biochemical studies in yeast make this an ideal system to dissect the regulation of AMPK and apply the new knowledge to human biology. We have found that yeast AMPK regulates glucose transport by controlling which glucose transporters are maintained on the plasma membrane. We will investigate the molecular mechanism by which yeast AMPK controls the localization, function and expression of glucose transporters. In addition we have discovered a novel mechanism by which the glucose analog, 2- deoxyglucose, inhibits glucose metabolism. Yeast and cancer cells share a metabolic strategy called aerobic glycolysis that makes them extra sensitive to 2-deoxyglucose. We will use genetic, biochemical and genomic technologies to define the mechanisms underlying the toxicity and acquired resistance to this compound. Last, we have identified Snf1 serine-214 phosphorylation as a novel mechanism for the down-regulation of Snf1 signaling. We will employ a genetic screen to identify the kinase responsible for the modification."

"9453440","PROJECT DESCRIPTION Type III secretion systems (T3SSs) are widely distributed among gram-negative bacteria symbiotic or pathogenic to animals, plants and insects. These complex specialized machines have evolved to transfer multiple bacterial-encoded proteins, known as bacterial effectors, into host eukaryotic cells to modulate a variety of cellular functions, thus shaping the bacteria/host cell functional interphase for the benefit of the injecting bacteria. A central component of T3SSs is a supramolecular structure known as the needle complex (NC), which mediates the passage of the secreted proteins through the bacterial envelope. The functionality of the NC as a secretion machine is conferred by other components of the T3SS such as the export apparatus, which mediates the passage of the secreted proteins through the bacterial inner membrane, the sorting platform, a cytoplasmic structure that establishes the order in the secretion process, and an associated cytoplasmic ATPase that energizes the system. This research project focuses on the structural and functional characterization of the sorting platform. Through a multidisciplinary approach involving genetics, biochemistry, cryo-electron tomography, and super-resolution microscopy we will try to obtain structural and functional information on this essential component of T3SSs."
"9425270","Summary  Chromosomal translocations are key drivers of oncogenic transformation and frequently determine the biology and response to therapy of cancer cells. The mechanisms that generate the DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) that initiate chromosomal translocations are well known in hematologic cancers but poorly understood in solid tumors. In lymphoma and leukemia, most DSBs that lead to an oncogenic translocation are generated by the activity of enzymes such as RAG1/2 and AID. These enzymes are physiologically responsible for the rearrangements of the immunoglobulin genes, but can initiate a translocation when they aberrantly target other genes. In contrast, in solid tumors where RAG1/2 and AID are largely not expressed, it is unclear what factors initiate DSB formation. Physical factors, such as UV light or irradiation, or factors intrinsic to the DNA structure or replication are thought to be responsible for part of the DSB and translocation formation, but they are insufficient to explain the recurrent patterns of oncogenic translocations in solid tumors. Recently, the APOBEC proteins have been linked to peculiar mutational signatures found in several solid cancers, including lung and breast cancers. Importantly, the APOBEC-dependent mutational signatures typically co-localize with genomic rearrangements such as translocations and somatic copy number alterations (SCNAs). Based on these correlative findings and preliminary experiments, our hypothesis is that APOBEC enzymes could be responsible not only for somatic mutations but also for the formation of chromosomal translocation in solid tumors. We will test this hypothesis by applying innovative sequencing techniques we developed in our lab to identify and map recurrent translocations induced by APOBEC proteins in different cell types. We will apply these techniques both in in vitro assays as well as to in vivo models of translocation formation. The demonstration that APOBEC protein can initiate translocation formation has the potential to provide a key mechanistic link that is currently missing to explain recurrent structural aberrations in cancer. From this demonstration, a variety of new research lines will open including potential therapeutic applications aimed at blocking APOBEC activity to reduce genomic instability in cancer."
"9449092","Abstract Sleep is essential for the maintenance of our cognition and neurological functions, and both quality and quantity of sleep are critical. We likely have known this for the entire human history. Yet, we remain astonishingly ignorant on how the quality and quantity of sleep are regulated. Excitingly, nature has provided us a very small number of human subjects who are genetically wired to sleep shorter hours per day (thus more efficiently). These people usually live a long and healthy (both physically and mentally) life. Identification of genetic changes in these people provides us concrete and specific molecules that are in the sleep duration/efficiency pathway. These molecules offer opportunities to not only map brain regions and cells for sleep regulation but also will lead us to gain understanding of neurocircuitry of sleep duration/efficiency. In this proposal, we will use integrated approaches to understanding how neurocircuit activities work in concert to regulate sleep duration/efficiency. Our hypothesis is that there exist unique neurocircuits for sleep duration and efficiency that are separate from the circuits for sleep-promoting and wake-promoting. Our experimental design outlined here is based on this hypothesis to reveal these circuits in a systematic way. We will first identify specific cell types with our gene-specific Cre mice. We will then generate a functional circuit diagram by mapping their projections. The role and function of these cells in sleep regulation will be tested in the context of circuit by linking the activity of these cells to sleep with precise interventional tools that change neural circuit dynamics. The results from this study will reveal how dynamic patterns of neural activity are transformed into efficient sleep. We will simultaneously monitor sleep state with EEG/EMG recording while actively recording and manipulating dynamic patterns of neural activity of specific cells. The results obtained from this study will provide a fundamental understanding of brain circuits for sleep duration/efficiency maintenance. Since quality sleep is the basis of healthy brain (cognitive and neurological function), understanding of how quality sleep circuit is obtained will not only shed new light on how poor sleep can lead to unhealthy brain but also give insight into mechanisms for treating brain dysfunctions."

"9394004","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are defined by their unique ability to differentiate into all mature blood cell lineages while at the same time regenerating themselves, in a process termed self-renewal, to sustain hematopoiesis throughout mammalian life. A model explaining the nature of HSC divisions proposes that the mode of a division of a stem cell (symmetric versus asymmetric) may determine the cell fate of the resulting two daughter cells, with a symmetric division resulting in daughter cells with simila regenerative potential and an asymmetric division leading to daughter cells with a dissimilar potential. Terminologies like polarity and division symmetry have already been previously discussed in other stem cell systems, including hematopoiesis. The molecular mechanisms of the triad HSC polarity - division symmetry - cell fate though has eluded the HSC field to date and which factors instruct this process is not known. The markers of polarity associated with division asymmetry are also ill-defined. We propose to investigate a molecular link, i.e. Cdc42 activity, in the stem cell polarity - mode of division - cell fate relationship. A new concept that Cdc42 activity and cell polarity represent a dial-able threshold in a bell shaped manner in determining stem cell fate (i.e. high and low Cdc42 activity could both cause a loss of polarity and affect the mode of the cell division and fate), is proposed. A rigorous examination of the influence of Cdc42 mediated polarity/apolarity on the mode of stem cell division and daughter cell fate will strongly benefit the stem cell field and will impact the therapy of blood diseases such as bone marrow failure and aging. We propose three specific aims: First, we will examine the potentially causal relationship between cell polarity and the mode of HSC division by a series of in vitro and in vivo cell polarization and division symmetry analysis at single cell resolution. Second, we will define the role of Cdc42 in regulating the ratio between polar and apolar HSCs and consequently the cell fate. Third, we will determine the signaling pathway from HSC polarity into divisional asymmetry by examining non-canonical Wnt5a regulated Cdc42 activity and subsequent actomyosin and JNK/p38 signaling in polarity and division symmetry of HSCs. The studies will use state of the art immunofluorescence, chemical biology, mouse genetics, and stem cell methodologies like single cell transplants to define the molecular basis of cell polarity and divisional symmetry and their causal role in determining HSC cell fate."
"9555566","Background: In the past year, we have focused on studying the effect of shed-antigen on the microdistribution of Zr-89-labeled amatuximab in tumor, apart from other factors such as tumor vascular density, interstitial fluid pressure (IFP) and extracellular matrix proteins that could affect the microdistibution of mAb.  For this study, we used a nude mouse model implanted with A431/H9 tumor which over-expresses both mesothelin and Lewis-Y on the tumor cell surface. Mesothelin is a membrane glycoprotein of 40 kDa. It is actively shed from the tumor cell surface. Lewis-Y is a carbohydrate antigen and is not actively shed from the tumor surface. As model antibodies, we used two mAbs, anti-mesothelin mAb amatuximab (mouse/human chimeric antibody with 82.6% amino acid sequence identity to a human IgG1 and nM KD binding affinity) and anti-Lewis-Y mAb B3 (murine IgG1 with 10 nM KD binding affinity). Comparative autoradiography studies using the A431/H9 tumor model targeted with Zr-89 labeled-amatuximab and -B3 enabled us to define the effects of shed-Ag on the tumor microdistribution of the Zr-89-mAb, apart from the effects of other factors such as vascular density, high interstitial fluid pressure (IFP) and extracellular protein contents. Objectives: To investigate the effect of the injection dose and the tumor size on the tumor microdistribution of these two mAbs radiolabeled with Zr-89 in nude mice bearing A431/H9. Methods: The mAbs were radiolabeled with Zr-89 using desferrioxamine with an isothiocyanate linker as a chelating agent. The Zr-89 labeled mAbs were then purified with a PD-10 column eluted with 0.25 M ammonium acetate at pH 5.5. The radiolabeled mAbs with the radiochemical purity >95% and the immunoreactivity >70% were used for in vivo studies. For autoradiography studies, the mice with A431/H9 tumor were injected iv with Zr-89-amatuximab (100 micro-Ci/10 or 60 micro-g) or Zr-89-B3 (80 micro-Ci/15 or 60 micro-g). The mice (n=3) were euthanized at 48 h post-injection and the tumors were excised. The tumors were embedded and frozen in Tissue-Tek CRYO-OCT compound (Sakura Finetek USA Inc., Torrance, CA, USA) at -20 degree C for 3 h. Serial 20 micro-m thick short axis sections were cut in 400 micro-m intervals covering the entire tumor. Two or three consecutive tumor slices were selected at 3 tumor regions (25%, 50%, and 75% long axis regions from the tumor surface) as representative sections throughout the tumor and exposed on the phosphor screen for 16 h. Signals were obtained by the use of the Typhoon FLA 7000 (GE Healthcare Life Sciences, Pittsburgh, PA, USA) with 25 micro-m pixel resolution and analyzed with Image Quant TL8.1 software. Values were grouped together from the 3 tumor regions to represent a tumor. Each tumor was treated as an independent sample. To analyze the microdistribution of the radioactivity in the tumor sections, we introduced a normalized length analysis method as described below. The first line was drawn along a longest axis, and the second line was drawn along a short axis perpendicularly at the center of the first longest line. The center was selected as the point where the two lines meet.  Additional lines were drawn evenly and continuously between the two original lines passing through the same center point (total 8 lines). Radioactivity profile of each line was analyzed with ImageJ (NIH, Bethesda, MD) and exported into Excel files to redefine values with MATLABs interpolation function interp1. The maximum length of each line in x-axis was normalized to 1 to correct for the differences in the length of each line for reconstruction of the radioactivity-vs-tumor penetration distance profiles of each tumor section.  The maximum signal intensity within each tumor section in y-axis was also normalized to 100 to correct for the differences in the signal intensity between each tumor section. Mean radioactivity-vs-distance profiles with standard deviation were then reconstructed for tumor sections obtained at 25%, 50%, and 75% regions. Results: The radioactivity-vs-distance profiles of Zr-89 B3 showed the peak radioactivity distributed in the tumor periphery which was then rapidly decreased as moved away from the periphery toward the tumor core for both 15 and 60 micro-g doses. These radioactivity-vs-distance profiles were also similar to that of Alexa-labeled B3 analyzed by fluorescence microscopy after the injection of 150 micro-g Alexa-B3. These findings are consistent with a notion that the IFP is often elevated in solid tumors but declines in the tumor periphery in the outer 0.21.1 mm. This transvascular pressure gradient may cause a mAb against non-shed tumor antigen to extravasate and accumulate preferentially in the tumor periphery rather than in the tumor core. In contrast, the profiles of Zr-89 amatuximab depended on the injected dose levels; the radioactivity distribution was more uniform with the radioactivity distributed in the tumor core similar to that in the tumor periphery for 10 micro-g injection whereas the profile became similar to those of Zr-89 B3 for 60 micro-g injection, showing that the peak radioactivity at the tumor periphery rapidly decreased as moved away from the tumor periphery toward the tumor core. These findings support a notion that for 10 micro-g dose, Zr-89 amatuximab in the blood circulation mostly bound to the shed-mesothelin in blood and a small amount of free Zr-89 amatuximab which entered into tumor extracellular space (ECS) after crossing the tumor vasculature would mostly exist as an antibody/antigen complex and thus, would be distributed more uniformly throughout the entire tumor by bypassing the binding sites on the surface of tumor cells nearest to the vasculature. In comparison, Zr-89 amatuximab injected at 60 g/dose has an estimated concentration of 260 nM in a blood immediately after injection and 28.3 nM at 48 h (based on 6.8 %ID/g of blood) and therefore in a much larger molar excess concentration compared to the steady state concentration of shed-mesothelin in the blood ( 6 nM). Consequently, it would remain mostly as an unbound free mAb form, thereby escaping from the sequestration into the reticuloendothelial system in liver during a 48 h period.  Therefore, a large portion of the injected dose (95.2 nM for the tumor uptake of 22.90 % ID/g tumor at 48 h and 952 nM in the ECS because the ECS is 10% of the total tumor volume) would have crossed the tumor vasculature and diffused into the ECS of tumor. This concentration (952 nM) is similar to the steady state concentration of the shed-Ag in the ECS (800 nM in 400 cubic mm tumor). This finding suggests that one of two Ag binding sites of amatuximab entered into the ECS would have been free to bind the membrane-bound mesothelin on tumor cells in periphery (i.e., in the lower IFP) rather than in the tumor core, similar to that shown for Zr-89 B3. Conclusion: A mAb injection dose, that could generate the mAb concentration at a several fold molar excess to the shed-Ag concentration in blood but generate the mAb concentration at a several fold lower than the shed-Ag concentration in the tumor ECS, would provide a beneficial effect in maximizing tumor uptake with a minimum liver and spleen uptakes while allowing deeper tumor penetration. This study, thus, provides an important message that it is important to find an optimum treatment regimen to enhance the delivery and penetration of mAb into tumor with shed-Ag."
"9549544","Bacillus anthracis (B. anthracis or anthrax) remains a health threat for the developed world. Both lethal and edema toxin (LT and ET respectively) contribute to the pathogenesis of organ injury and lethality during anthrax infection. Understanding the mechanisms underlying the toxins pathogenic effects will be important for improving the outcome with this lethal infection. In vitro findings do suggest that each toxin can produce endothelial injury and loss of vascular integrity and increased permeability. Although never tested in the lung, increased endothelial permeability with the toxins could result in extravasation of fluid, reductions in oxygen transfer and lung compliance, and increased pulmonary vascular resistance. To investigate these possibilities, the present study will employ an isolated perfused rat lung model to examine whether LT or ET does cause pulmonary endothelial injury and increased pulmonary vascular permeability. This ex vivo model will allow a direct measure of changing lung weight over time, which is required to calculate a lung permeability coefficient. Determining whether either toxin alters lung permeability will improve our understanding of the pathogenesis and management of anthrax associated lung injury clinically.    This study will be done in two parts. In the first part (Part 1), an isolated perfused rat lung model will be developed and the models ability to measure changes in endothelial permeability, oxygenation, compliance and vascular resistance tested with lungs isolated from healthy rats. As a positive control, Part 1 will include experiments in lungs challenged with thromboxane A2, a mediator known to increase lung endothelial permeability. In the second part (Part 2), lungs will be challenged with LT or ET introduced into the isolated lungs perfusion circuit and lung function will be measured. Some experiments in this part of the study will also include the use of Raxibacumab, a monoclonal antibody that inhibits host cell uptake of LT and ET, and adefovir, an intracellular inhibitor of ET, to further explore mechanisms underlying these toxins pathogenic effects. The functional parameters tested in Part 2 will include permeability, oxygenation, compliance and vascular resistance. Some lungs from Part 2 will be sent for histology and examination by electron microscopy.  This study is ongoing."
"9608906","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Lipid-enveloped viruses replicate and bud from host cell membranes where they acquire their lipid coat. Understanding the budding processes of several viruses has had significant impact on elucidating the viral life cycle and identifying therapeutic targets. Filoviruses have a filamentous lipid- envelope and despite being discovered more than 30 years ago, not much is known on how they acquire their lipid coat. Filoviruses include Ebola virus (EBOV) and Marburg virus (MARV), which can have up to 90% clinical fatality. Filoviruses encode seven genes including the viral matrix protein VP40, which regulates budding from the host cell. VP40 as the only filovirus protein expressed in mammalian cells is sufficient to produce virus like particles (VLPs) nearly indistinguishable from live virions. Thus, VP40 has served as a model to study viral budding outside of BSL-4 laboratories. To date, little is known about how VP40 interacts with biological membranes to regulate budding and egress from the host cell plasma membrane. During the previous project period, we found that EBOV VP40 (eVP40) required PS on the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane to bind, assemble, and form VLPs. Notably, interactions of eVP40 with the plasma membrane induced exposure of PS on the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane at sites of egress; whereas PS is typically only on the inner leaflet. Flipping/transport of PS to the outer leaflet may aid PS presentation on the surface of nascent virions to facilitate TIM-1-mediated entry into cells. These findings provided a clear link between selective binding and transport of a lipid across the membrane of the human cell and use of that lipid for subsequent viral entry. New preliminary data and collaboration with a structural biologist has demonstrated that in addition to PS, eVP40 requires plasma membrane PI(4,5)P2 for assembly and budding. In contrast, MARV VP40 (mVP40) acts as an anionic charge sensor, promiscuously binding anionic lipids consistent with the new X-ray structure solved by our collaborator. The central hypothesis is that eVP40 and mVP40 have fundamentally different lipid binding properties. This renewal proposal will investigate lipid binding, assembly, and budding properties of eVP40 and mVP40. Specific Aim 1 will investigate the mechanisms by which eVP40 and mVP40 differentially interact with plasma membrane lipids to facilitate budding. We will also investigate the role of plasma membrane cholesterol content and membrane fluidity on eVP40 and mVP40 membrane binding, oligomerization, and budding. Specific aim 2 will investigate the role of a plasma membrane sphingolipid in eVP40 and mVP40 VLP formation. Biochemical and cellular assays in combination with structural analysis by our collaborator will be used to elucidate the molecular architecture of the eVP40 and mVP40 assembly events. Taken together, these studies should produce important mechanistic insight into how filovirus particles form from the plasma membrane of cells."
"9443941","The long term objective of this research proposal is to determine the molecular mechanisms of vascular calcification in order to identify novel target(s) for the treatment of chronic kidney disease (CKD)-dependent vascular calcification. Vascular calcification is closely associated with cardiovascular mortality in patients with CKD. In fact, more than half of all deaths in CKD patients can be attributed to cardiovascular diseases. Our previous study revealed that activation of a bile acid nuclear receptor, FXR, strongly attenuates CKD- dependent vascular calcification in animal models though an unknown mechanism. Recently, our metabolomic approach has identified that levels of a microbial bile acid metabolite, deoxycholic acid (DCA), are highly associated with an increased risk for higher coronary artery calcification (CAC) volumes and lower lumbar bone mineral density (BMD) in human patients and mice with CKD. We hypothesized that DCA generated by gram-positive bacteria causes CKD-dependent vascular calcification. Our hypothesis is also supported by the following evidence derived from a series of preliminary results from our lab: 1) CKD increases levels of circulating DCA. 2) FXR activation by its agonists preferentially reduces levels of DCA and a precursor of DCA, cholic acid. 3) FXR knockout mice with vascular calcification have significantly higher levels of DCA. 4) CKD alters gut bacteria populations and increases levels of the DCA-producing bacteria. 5) Activation of FXR normalizes the alteration of gut bacteria populations by CKD. 6) DCA but not other bile acids induces mineralization of VSMCs through TGR5-PKA-?-catenin signaling. To determine the pivotal role of microbial DCA in the pathogenesis of vascular calcification, we propose 3 specific aims: Specific Aim 1: Examine the molecular mechanism by which DCA induces vascular calcification in vitro. Specific Aim 2: A) Examine whether alterations of circulating DCA levels and gut bacteria populations influence CKD-dependent vascular calcification in vivo. B) Examine whether modulation of intestinal bacteria affects CKD-dependent vascular calcification in vivo. Specific Aim 3: Examine whether TGR5-PKA-?-catenin signaling contributes to CKD- dependent vascular calcification in vivo."
"9616947","Center Summary/Abstract Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is escalating in California and the United States and is associated with the rising obesity epidemic. NAFLD is a hepatic phenotype that encompasses the more serious manifestation of steatohepatitis (NASH), considered to be a prerequisite for liver cancer (hepatocellular carcinoma/HCC). We also know from recent clinical studies that chemical toxicant exposure, in the absence of obesity, can lead to toxicant-associated steatohepatitis (TASH), which closely resembles the pathology of NASH. These findings are relevant to SRP stakeholders in Region 9, since California ranks high in National Priorities List (Superfund sites) nationally and contains thousands of additional hazardous waste sites (HWS). In addition, the UCSD NAFLD Research Center shows that American Indians and Hispanics, combined the largest non-Caucasian population in California, are at far greater risk of developing NAFLD. Over the past five years, our SRC has leveraged resources to demonstrate that TASH is greatly accelerated by consumption of high-fat diet (HFD) or after a diabetic episode in mice. These findings are relevant, since we can speculate that American Indians and Hispanics are more susceptible to TASH development, a risk amplified by unhealthy diets, poverty and health disparities. The UCSD SRC will be developing models through its Biomedical projects to characterize the mechanisms of Superfund toxicant induced TASH development and cancer, while the Environmental Science & Engineering (ES&E) projects will develop tools for NPL-toxicant detection and remediation. Biomedical and ES&E projects will be assisted in these efforts by Research Core services that will provide tools for mouse genetic production, metabolomic and sophisticated Bioinformatic analysis. A key objective of the projects is to highlight scientific findings to maximize Research Translation, which will happen with collaborations between the projects and the Research Translation Core. We believe our program is innovative and paradigm shifting, since it has the potential of linking important basic research findings regarding Superfund toxicant exposure with human disease biomarker identification through collaborations with the UCSD NAFLD Research Center, which contains one of the largest NALFD cohort studies in the world. Importantly, our Biomedical findings and tools developed in the ES&E projects will be used as resources and knowledge gained to reduce cumulative impacts and health disparities. These initiatives will be leveraged through Community Engagement Core efforts in disadvantaged Hispanic neighborhoods in San Diego and Mexico where statistics confirms that obesity is an escalating problem both in children and adults. Since the incidence of NAFLD and liver cirrhosis is on the rise in both children and adults and may be linked to toxicant chemical exposure, our findings will be communicated to SRP primary stakeholders at the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry, in addition to state and local agencies."
"9549474","By developing a large database of BAL fluid linked to specific microbiologic diagnoses, we plan to define protein expression signature response profiles that distinguish specific etiologies of lung infection and inflammation.  These signature profiles will be based on mass spectrometry, two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and suspension array technologies.  Because of the variability associated with individual host responses to infection due to differences in host immunity, sampling time effects, and external factors such as antibiotic or anti-inflammatory therapies, a large database will be required.  The profiles of culture-negative BAL fluid will be of similar interest to assist in defining non-infectious etiologies of lung inflammation.  A secondary objective is to perform proteomic analysis on serum collected from patients at the time of bronchoscopy. The goal is to link serum proteomic profiles to BAL proteomic profiles to determine whether a less invasive technique can predict infiltrate etiology with comparable sensitivity and specificity to BAL profiles.  To complement the patient studies we have investigated protein biomarkers in blood and lavage from animal models of pneumonia. We have studied a rabbit model of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (Proteomics 2010;10: 4270-4280) and a canine model of staphylococcal pneumonia (Am J Physiol Heart Circ Physiol 2007;293;H2487-500). Exploring these model systems will facilitate our identification of candidate biomarkers across species.  We have recently developed new mass spectrometry-based protocols to detect bacterial peptides in bronchoalveolar lavage from patients with pneumonia. Identifying peptide biomarkers that are specific and unique for a pathogen offers the possibility of a method with higher sensitivity to detect bacteria in BAL. We have developed two methods (top down and bottom up approaches) that can be applied to clinical samples in order to rapidly identify Gram-negative pathogens. The former approach requires the removal of leukocytes, use of high performance liquid chromatography  mass spectrometry (LC/MS) and deconvolution of the resultant ions to a database (Biotyper) that can be interrogated for the identification of the microorganism. The bottom up approach is based upon the creation of a theoretical tryptic core peptidome from genomic data and comparison with peptides generated from tryptic digests of bacteria that are analyzed by LC/MS-MS. The specificity of the peptides for a particular strain or species of bacteria is done by proteomic database analysis (Unipept, pBLAST) and then validated experimentally with lysed bacteria with labeled targeted peptides. We have recently used this approach to rapidly identify strain-specific peptide markers of Acinteobacter baumannii based on LC-MS/MS profiling of digested peptides (Clin Chem. 2016 Jun;62(6):866-75.). Clinical application of these methods is ongoing.   We have a total of 589 clinical samples from 438 different subjects.  Of the 438 subjects, 1 subject specified that their samples could not be shared with outside investigators.  All subjects underwent the clinically indicated bronchoscopies and no samples were collected purely for research.  The total number of pediatric subjects enrolled to date is 30.  Approximately one half of the participants have a specific microbiologic diagnosis as a cause of their pulmonary infiltrates.  Enrollment thus far in the cases of interest includes:  Aspergillus species 58, P. jiroveci 63, Cytomegalovirus 61, Mycobacterial species 41, and Bacteria (gram negative or gram positive) 118.  Approximately 50-60% of these infections occur with more than one microbial pathogen (i.e. Aspergillus species and cytomegalovirus).  Infections with only a single pulmonary pathogen are somewhat less common than co-infection states.  New samples of the bronchoalveolar lavage and blood are currently being analyzed."

"9555570","Informed consent is an important component of ethical research.  Unfortunately, data show that research participants do not always understand key features of the research they participate in.  At the same time, consent documents are increasingly becoming longer, more technical, and complex.  This project aims to test a simpler, more concise consent form against the standard consent form in a variety of research projects. Both consent forms contain all the elements required by federal regulations, and are approved by an IRB. Participants in these trials are randomized to receive either the standard or the concise consent form and then asked to complete a questionnaire that tests their comprehension of study information and their satisfaction with the process. Our hypothesis is that comprehensionn will be similar in both groups and satisfaction higher in the group that receives the concise form.  If the data support our hypothesis, investigators and institutions may be encouraged to write forms that are easier to read and shorter.  Two studies with healthy volunteers are complete and published, a third study enrolling more than 4000 patient  volunteers from around the world was analyzed and results published in 2017.  Further analysis related to changes in consent forms is ongoing."
"9604861","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Telomeres stabilize the genome by distinguishing natural chromosome ends from DNA damage (end protection) and by facilitating replication of terminal DNA tracts via telomerase (telomere maintenance). These functions are executed through a dynamic molecular switch that converts the chromosome terminus from a fully protected (telomerase non-extendable) conformation into an open (telomerase-extendable) state. The molecular basis of the switch is unknown, but it must be strictly controlled as inappropriate exposure of the terminus or failure to fully replicate it leads to stem cell disease and cancer. In this renewal application we exploit the model eukaryote Arabidopsis to reveal new insight into the interplay between telomerase and the CST (CTC1/STN1/TEN1) telomere protein complex. The application builds on important discoveries from the previous funding period that include: 1) an alternative telomerase RNP complex with protein binding partners implicated in chromosome end protection; 2) a dynamic switch between a telomerase accessory factor POT1a, which positively regulates telomerase, and TEN1 a core component of CST, which negatively regulates telomerase; and 3) a non-canonical telomerase RNA (TER2) that negatively regulates telomerase enzyme activity in response to DNA damage. The central hypothesis of this application is that telomerase components together with CST orchestrate the assembly and dynamic exchange of end protection and replication complexes to promote telomere stability. This hypothesis will be tested through two specific Aims that employ a combination of biochemical, genetic and cell biological approaches. Aim 1 will investigate how blunt-end telomeres are stabilized. This work will focus on the roles of Ku, POT1b and POT1c in telomere protection, and will test the hypothesis that a processed form of TER2, TER2s, serves as an RNA scaffold to cap blunt-end telomeres. Aim 2 will define the dynamic interactions between CST, telomerase accessory proteins and the TER2 regulatory RNA to elucidate how these factors control telomere synthesis by telomerase. Aim 2 focuses on the roles of TEN1 and TER2 in terminating telomerase-mediated telomere elongation. The impact of these studies is that they will establish new paradigms for telomere protection and telomerase regulation, and yield insight into the emerging roles of long noncoding RNA in promoting genome integrity. In a broader sense, the results will explain how rapid evolution of telomere components can be used to achieve common mechanisms of telomere homeostasis as well as new modes of telomere regulation. Since it is likely that the sophisticated mechanisms of telomerase regulation discovered in Arabidopsis are conserved, completion of these aims will provide important new information about telomerase and CST related human disease."
"9509090","Abstract  Each year over 525,000 children under age five are killed by diarrhea caused by infectious disease. Cryptosporidiosis, the second most frequent cause of childhood diarrhea, is an infection caused by colonization of the intestines by the eukaryotic parasites, Cryptosporidium parvum or C. hominis, and particularly damages and kills malnourished children. Despite the high incidence and significant impact on malnourished children, there are no effective preventive or therapeutic treatments for cryptosporidiosis in this population.  N-myristoyltransferase (NMT) is an enzyme which transfers myristate, a 14-carbon fatty acid, to the N-terminus of glycyl-peptides and contributes to targeting the substrate protein to membrane regions. NMT has been validated as a drug target in fungal and parasitic diseases, including malaria and leishmaniasis. Our collaborators previously screened the GSK Tres Cantos proprietary library of 3 million compounds against P. falciparum NMT and identified 8 unique clusters of compounds with anti NMT activity. We hypothesized that NMT inhibitors effective against Plasmodium would also be active against Cryptosporidium. To test this hypothesis, we screened representative compounds from each cluster for their ability to inhibit Cryptosporidium NMT (CpNMT) activity (using an in vitro enzymatic assay) and parasite growth (using a cell culture assay). We have identified three different scaffolds effective at inhibiting CpNMT, one of which was also effective at preventing replication in cell culture.  Based on our preliminary results, we hypothesize that inhibitors targeting CpNMT will result in parasite clearance in animal models of infection. We propose to test our hypothesis by examining our best hit compounds in a mouse model of infection. We will first expand our library of three hit scaffolds by synthesizing and acquiring structurally related compounds using a structure-guided approach. We will progress the compounds through a screening cascade composed of in vitro assays to characterize the compounds and determine structure activity relationship (SAR) profiles of the hit scaffolds. Select compounds will then be tested in an animal model of infection to determine if the NMT inhibitors are active in vivo. In parallel, we will develop structural biology tools for determining the mode of binding and crystal structure of bound compounds to the CpNMT enzyme."
"9445345","The U.S. population of dual language learners (DLLs), or children who are exposed to and learning through two languages, has grown rapidly in the last decade. DLLs from low-income families lag significantly behind their monolingual English-speaking peers on school readiness measures at kindergarten entry, and the achievement gap continues to widen with age. Despite the critical role of socio-emotional development (SED) in children's long-term health and achievement, significant gap exists in our knowledge on how bilingual experience shapes SED. By integrating the assessment methods on language, executive functions, and SED, this R01 takes an interdisciplinary approach to study the reciprocal relations between bilingual (English and heritage language) development and SED in a longitudinal study. We will follow 400 DLLs (50% females, initially 3-4 years of age) from low-income Spanish-speaking Mexican American families (N = 200) and Cantonese-speaking Chinese American families (N = 200) annually for three years (T1 and T2 in preschool, T3 in kindergarten). Three waves of multi-method and multi-context data on children's English and heritage language proficiency, executive functions, SED, and quality of parent-child and teacher-child relationships will be collected to address the following specific aims: 1) Investigate the contributions of early English and heritage language development to DLLs' later SED, and test executive functions as a mediating mechanism; 2) Examine the contributions of early bilingual development to DLLs' parent-child and teacher-child relationships, and test relationship quality as mediators between language and SED; 3) Examine cultural differences in DLLs' social relationships, and test whether culture moderates the links between language and relationships; and 4) Test whether other child, family, and school factors moderate the relations between language and SED. The proposed research will contribute to the scientific knowledge on the linking of development across domains (language, executive function, and SED), and have implications for early childhood education policy, assessment, curriculum development, teacher training, and family engagement practice on DLLs."
"9462997","Project Summary/Abstract Research benefitting the health of children requires training a new generation of pediatric physician-scientists prepared for independent careers in basic biomedical research. The collaborative research enterprise of Emory University and Children's Healthcare of Atlanta is committed to meeting this need. During the past five year cycle of funding for the NICHD Child Health Research Career Development Program, the Atlanta Pediatric Scholars Program enrolled 8 outstanding young investigators, 3 of whom are currently continuing their K12 appointments. The 5 Scholars who have completed their appointments have been tremendously successful; one has received both R56 and R01 grants, 2 have received K08 awards, and the other 2 have K08 applications that have been reviewed and received scores in the fundable range. Collectively, APSP Scholars have published 57 manuscripts during the project period. For this renewal application, we have expanded the training faculty to 30 basic science investigators, each with an active laboratory research program, with total extramural grant support of $29.6 M and an additional $27 M in resources from start-up funds. Reflecting the program's multidisciplinary approach, 9 prospective mentors are outside the Department of Pediatrics, in other Emory departments, including the Department of Biomedical Engineering, a joint department between Emory and the Georgia Institute of Technology. Robust fellowship programs in the Department of Pediatrics and continued recruitment of junior faculty provide a large pool of outstanding Scholar candidates. The formal training curriculum is grounded in intensive laboratory research in areas of basic and translational science relevant to child health, mentored by experienced investigators, and supplemented by didactic coursework, career development training, and participation in scientific exchange. The APSP marshals Emory's extensive resources for faculty career development toward the goal of training pediatric physician-scientists. The strengths and resources of the Emory research enterprise, along with partnership with Georgia Tech, bolster a critical mass of investigators working in a variety of child health-related disciplines within the Emory Department of Pediatrics to create an ideal environment for basic research career development. The research infrastructure to support this program is therefore in place, and robust partnerships among Emory, Children's Healthcare of Atlanta and Georgia Tech continue to support recruitment and expansion of the research enterprise. Training of physician-scientists from minority and underprivileged backgrounds is a particular focus of this program, and will be facilitated by existing strengths and partnerships in Atlanta. The program includes a rigorous system for tracking and assessing progress. The Atlanta Pediatric Scholars Program is an important component of a growing academic enterprise in Atlanta focusing on child health, and is poised to provide outstanding career development for the next generation of leaders in child health research."
"9456311","PROJECT SUMMARY: During the immune response activated antigen-specific CD8 T cells differentiate into effector cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) that can recognize and directly kill pathogenic (infected and malignant) cells. Only a few antigen specific T cells that can survive through the primary immune response, forming long-lived memory cells that are critical for secondary encounter with the antigen. Unfortunately, in some pathological conditions such as chronic viral infections and cancer, CTL immune responses are compromised. Specifically, persistent antigen exposure and inflammation prevent the formation of memory T cells and drive effector CTLs into an over-differentiated state where they become so-called ?exhausted? cells with greatly diminished cytotoxic function. Despite extensive research, the mechanisms that regulate these processes are not fully understood. We have identified a novel post-transcriptional mechanism in CD8 T cells that regulates the differentiation of CTLs and is guided by let-7 microRNAs. We found that low expression of let-7 in CD8 T cells enhances differentiation, while high levels suppresses it. We hypothesize that the modulation of let-7 during the differentiation of CD8 T cells is critical for the generation of exhausted and memory T cells, and that let-7 has a unique pattern of expression in each population. We propose a model where persistent antigen stimulation inhibits the expression of let-7 in differentiating CD8 T cells, compromising the generation of functional CTLs and memory T cells. Aim-1 will identify the role of let-7 microRNA expression in the differentiation of effector CTLs into exhausted cells. Aim-2 will determine the role of let-7 in the generation of memory T cells. To address these aims we will analyze the differentiation of CD8 T cells with different levels of let-7 microRNAs into exhausted and memory T cells using a tumor model. Furthermore, using this unique system we will characterize the molecular mechanisms by which let-7 affects the differentiation of exhausted and memory T cells. It is anticipated that these experiments will define let-7 as a new therapeutic target."
"9552564","Despite research establishing the relationship between sleep disturbances and alcohol use, there is no clear understanding or model for what occurs once individuals who seek inpatient alcoholism treatment are discharged from rehabilitation facilities and attempt to integrate back into their homes and communities. The purpose of this investigation will be to characterize sleep patterns, perceptions, and beliefs throughout the process of alcohol rehabilitation. The misuse of alcohol is a global public health concern that compromises both individual and societal wellbeing, resulting in an estimated 2.5 million deaths annually. The National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) distinguishes alcoholism by craving, loss of control, physical dependence, and tolerance (NIAAA, Alcohol Use Disorders). Outcome expectancies, behavioral capability, and self-efficacy beliefs are central constructs in the Social Cognitive Theory (Bandura, 1986) and are measured directly in this study using both quantitative and qualitative methods. A mixed methods approach is being used to study the following aims: a) to assess individuals' perceptions of and experiences with sleep during alcohol rehabilitation, b) to describe sleep patterns, perceptions, and beliefs among alcohol-dependent individuals throughout the transition from a clinical research facility providing rehabilitation treatment back to the community, c) to assess whether sleep-related beliefs and/or behavior of individuals are predictive of sleep quality or relapse to drinking, and d) to assess whether sleep quality predicts relapse.   Sleep quality and duration are quantitatively assessed approximately one week prior to discharge from the inpatient facility and again 4-6 weeks post-discharge. A sub-set of participants are asked to wear actiwatches (accelerometers) to provide objective data on sleep throughout the transition from inpatient to outpatient. In addition to quantitative measures, qualitative semi-structured interviews were conducted with a subset of participants within a week of the scheduled discharge date and again four to six weeks post-discharge to assess perceptions of sleep during recovery. This proposed study will fill a gap in the literature by characterizing sleep throughout the rehabilitation process and ongoing maintenance of abstinence. The study is currently ongoing with 100 participants enrolled thus far. The qualitative portion of the study is completed and has been published. Recruitment for the quantitative portion of the study will continue until the proposed sample size is reached (N=219.)"
"9456175","Summary/Abstract  Our preliminary data suggest the existence of as-of-yet unidentified regulator of the important inflammatory pathway controlled by Toll-like Receptor 4 (TLR4), and the central goals of this project are to identify and validate candidate regulators using comprehensive genome-scale analyses. TLR4 induces potent inflammation in response to lipid A, the core component of bacterial endotoxin. While this response provides a first line of defense against bacterial infection, excessive TLR4 signaling promotes disease. Thus, understanding how TLR4 signaling is regulated is of central importance for understanding both health and disease processes. Despite the substantial progress made in elucidating many aspects of TLR4 biology, the mechanisms by which signaling is suppressed in the absence of ligand and then initiated upon the formation of a signaling complex remains a relatively less understood aspect of TLR4's mechanism.  In recent preliminary work, we inferred the existence of a currently unidentified negative regulator of TLR4 signaling, which we term the TLR4 inhibitory complex (TIC) and which operates via a mechanism distinct from that of any known negative regulator of TLR4 signaling. We hypothesize that TIC binds TLR4, preventing it from signaling in an otherwise constitutive fashion, such that deficiencies or disruptions of TIC components may drive chronic TLR4 signaling. Indeed, this switch-like TLR4 signaling hypothesis is consistent with the peculiar observation that distinct non-canonical ligands, such as metals, can also trigger TLR4 signaling. Understanding how such negative regulation is disrupted, for example in the context of genetic polymorphisms, could also shed important diagnostic light on many diseases involving chronic inflammation. To investigate this TIC hypothesis, in this project we propose to both identify putative components of TIC and validate their involvement in TLR4-driven inflammation.  In our first aim, we will identify candidate TIC components, which negatively regulate constitutive TLR4 signaling, via an unbiased genome-scale knock-out screen. We will harness the power of CRISPR/Cas9-based functional genomic screens to investigate the knockout of 19,000 protein-coding genes, evaluate the impacts of these knockouts on TLR4 signaling, and generate a ranked list of putative TIC components. In our second aim, we will validate and evaluate the role of candidate TIC components in TLR4 signaling. We will investigate whether depletion of putative TIC components identified in Aim 1 confers constitutive TLR4 signaling. Validated targets will be further investigated using biochemical assays to investigate whether TIC components physically associate with TLR4 in both the presence and absence of endotoxin, which would ultimately confirm a role for putative TIC components in ligand-dependent TLR4 signaling.  If successful, this project would contribute novel understanding of an important driver of inflammation and could identify novel target(s) of value for diagnosing and treating infections and inflammatory diseases."
"9555572","Our key findings indicate:   1. As determined by our expert measurement panel, Adults with Chronic Health Care Needs can be usefully defined at the population level as Adults with 1) ongoing physical, cognitive, or mental health conditions or difficulties functioning who 2) need health or related support services of a type or amount beyond that needed by adults of the same sex and similar age.   2. As determined by our secondary data analyses, ACHCN are not a special population, but may instead comprise over half of working age persons. Thus, the screener we have developed to identify this population includes elements that can be used for stratification into meaningful subgroups for the purpose of informing policies, programs, and services intended to support the population.   3. As also determined by our analyses, multiple chronic conditions are the norm among ACHCN, and the number of chronic conditions experienced rises with the extent of disability.  4. Most working age individuals with one or more chronic condition(s) do not have high service need or use, but among those that do, functional and activity limitations are quite common. Adults with functional limitations (in such areas as seeing, hearing, mobility and cognition) have elevated rates of need and utilization of healthcare services, while individuals with ADL and IADL limitations have the highest rates.  5. Access problems, such as delay or non-receipt of needed medical care, are significantly greater among ACHCN compared to individuals without chronic health care needs. While ACHCN are somewhat more likely to be insured than their counterparts, substantial numbers report being uninsured part or all of the average year.  6. Healthcare disparities based on race/ethnicity demonstrably affect people with disabilities, with African American and Hispanic individuals fairing worse than whites in several measures of service use and/or health insurance coverage.  7. Over 40 percent of all annual visits to Emergency Rooms are made by people with disabilities. Three key factors affect their ED use: access to regular medical care (including prescription medications), extent of disability, and the complexity of their health profiles.    From October 01, 2016 to September 30, 2017, the activities conducted for this project have focused primarily on dissemination.  This included the publication of the ACHCN definition and screener itself (in press) as well as associated products, such as a scoping literature review on the measurement of chronic conditions and disability (currently under review) and a book chapter on the epidemiology of disability and chronic conditions in the United States and internationally (in press).  Presentations on the ACHCN work were also made at the Heller School for Social Policy and Management and the NIH Clinical Center.  Additionally, work has begun on the creation of a new pooled analysis file, drawn from multiple years of the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (2010-2014).  This will enable the research team to continue with secondary data analyses in the coming year."
"9597768","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Upper gastrointestinal adenocarcinomas (UGCs) of the esophagus and stomach are a major health problem world-wide. Approximately 80% of patients in the United States present with regional or distant metastases. Unfortunately, the mortality rates for UGCs approach incidence rates, suggesting that the available therapeutic options are limited and ineffective. Understanding the molecular biology and signaling networks of UGCs is a critical step in order to develop specific therapies that can potentially improve the outcomes. This proposal stems from our original finding that Aurora kinase A (AURKA) is a critical target at the 20q amplicon that is overexpressed in approximately 60% of UGCs. Our recent studies indicate that the AURKA protein is a potent pro-survival protein that promotes resistance to chemotherapeutic drugs through activation of oncogenic signaling pathways. Our preliminary data demonstrate that AURKA mediates up- regulation and phosphorylation of EIF4E. We have also shown that cells with acquired resistance to mTOR inhibitor RAD001 develop an increase in the protein level of AURKA, as compared to their parental cells, whereas overexpression of AURKA leads to resistance to mTOR inhibitor RAD001. Several recent studies have shown that EIF4E is a key component of cap-dependent translation of several oncogenes such as c- MYC, CCND1, and VEGF. We have uncovered the presence of a novel positive feedback loop of AURKA- EIF4E-MYC that drives cancer cell survival and resistance to therapy. In addition, our data provide evidence that AURKA can bypass key signaling pathways and phosphorylate EIF4E independent of mTOR, AKT and ERK1/2 activities. Based on our novel discoveries, we hypothesize that activation of the AURKA-EIF4E-MYC signaling loop and EIF4E-dependent oncogenic translation drive cancer cell survival as well as resistance to RAD001. In Aim 1, we will investigate the role of AURKA in regulating EIF4E cap-dependent translation in UGCs. We will investigate the mechanisms and molecular functions of the AURKA-EIF4E-MYC loop in Aim 2. Aim 3 of this proposal will determine the potential clinical significance of the AURKA-EIF4E-MYC axis. In this aim, we will also investigate the therapeutic potential of targeting the AURKA-EIF4E-MYC axis using AURKA inhibitor MLN8237 alone or in combinations for overcoming resistance to RAD001. Upon completion of our work, we expect to unveil a new paradigm for molecular mechanisms regulating cancer cell survival by AURKA-EIF4E-MYC axis. The translational components of this project have been established with measurable end points that could facilitate the development of better diagnostic, prognostic, and possibly therapeutic interventions. Therefore, our findings will have a positive impact on understanding the biology which could accelerate the development of novel medical treatments for the deadly UGCs."

"9551830","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Thoracic aortic aneurysms (TAAs), a generally asymptomatic process, develop as a consequence to abnormal remodeling of the aortic extracellular matrix (ECM) which weakens the aortic wall and leads to gross dilation that typically progresses to rupture. Currently, the treatment options consist of surgical reconstruction or endovascular intervention; neither of which addresses the underlying pathways which drive this devastating disease. TAAs are influenced by both intracellular and extracellular mechanisms that function to regulate matrix deposition and degradation, in part through the activation of the matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). Previously, we identified membrane type-1 MMP (MT1-MMP) as a key mediator of TAA formation, through its role in both pericellular proteolysis and intracellular signaling. Utilizing murine model of TAA, protein levels of MT1-MMP increased during TAA development and localized to aortic fibroblasts. Moreover, MT1- MMP activity displayed a direct relationship with aortic dilatation. Importantly, when TAAs were induced in MT1-MMP heterozygous deficient mice, aortic dilatation was attenuated, suggesting it is required for TAA progression. Nevertheless, little is known in regards to the mechanisms that regulate the temporal expression, abundance, and activity of MT1-MMP during TAA development. MicroRNAs (miRs) have recently been identified as upstream mediators involved in the post-transcriptional regulation of protein production. We have demonstrated a loss in miR-133a expression, a validated miR that targets MT1-MMP translation, during TAA development. This loss of miR-133a displayed an inverse relationship with aortic size and coincided with an increase in MT1-MMP protein. Furthermore, several studies have suggested that MT1-MMP may be phosphorylated by protein kinase C and may play a role in regulating MT1-MMP activity through endocytosis. However, whether or not this phosphorylation may differentiate the multiple roles of MT1-MMP in regards to pericellular proteolysis and intracellular signaling remains to be defined. Accordingly, the central hypothesis of this proposal is that modulation of the dynamic regulation of MT1-MMP protein abundance, activity, and localization mediates TAA formation and progression, which will be examined with the following specific aims: (1) Demonstrate that MT1-MMP abundance and TAA development are regulated by changes in aortic fibroblast phenotype, mediated by changes in miR133a expression; (2) Demonstrate that pericellular proteolysis and intracellular signaling are mediated by changes in MT1- MMP cellular localization, regulated by phosphorylation of C-terminal residues. These studies will provide evidence for mechanistic changes that occur during TAA development, and will focus on both post-transcriptional and post-translational mechanisms that may reveal potential therapeutic targets."
"9522693","Tick-borne human disease cases are rising and outnumber mosquito-borne diseases in temperate climates. In North America, Ixodes scapularis ranks as the tick of highest public health concern as vector of Borrelia burgdorferi (Bb, an agent of Lyme disease), Anaplasma phagocytophilum (Ap, agent of human anaplasmosis), and Powassan or deer tick virus (agent of Powassan encephalitis), among others. In this resubmission, we will take advantage of our advances in rickettsial genomics to create rickettsiae able to express transgenes in ticks. Transgenic approaches are not yet available for ticks, in part hindered by their months- to year-long generation times. Our ability to generate aposymbiotic ticks coupled with our membrane feeder to reconstitute ticks with transformed R. buchneri and challenge them experimentally with Ap and Bb has opened unprecedented possibilities to dissect the interactions between ticks, their symbionts, and the pathogens they transmit. Symbionts play a fundamental role in shaping an arthropod's immune system. This highlights the need to understand how the tick immune system works when investigating the possibility of a paratransgenic strategy for tick-borne disease control. The tick immune system is not well understood, but Dr. Pedra, a co-investigator in the renewal project, has discovered fundamental differences from the insect immune system.  The overarching hypotheses of our proposal are 1) that the rickettsial symbiont of I. scapularis (Rickettsia buchneri) plays a core role in regulating this tick's relationship with pathogens that determines its capacity to be a vector, and 2) that the tick immune system is an important intermediary in this triad. In order to dissect the interacting components, we will address the following aims:  Aim 1) Determine R. buchneri role in tick fitness, exclusion of other rickettsiae, susceptibility to Ap and Bb.  Aim 2) Prepare R. buchneri transposon mutants that are competent to colonize ticks using a Himar1 transposon designed for subsequent replacement using Recombinase Mediated Cassette Exchange (RMCE).  Aim 3) Replace the Himar1 transposon with an expression cassette encoding an anti-Ap Nanobody in colonization competent R. buchneri mutants; determine susceptibility of reconstituted I. scapularis to Ap.  Aim 4.1) Determine whether R. buchneri presence in I. scapularis affects the activity of the IMD pathway.  Aim 4.2) Identify host factors that alter immune signaling during colonization of I. scapularis by Ap and Bb in the presence or absence of R. buchneri.  At the conclusion of the proposed project we will have gained detailed knowledge about R. buchneri as a provider of essential nutrients to ticks, as a factor required for maturation of a functional tick immune system, and as a controller of pathogen acquisition and transmission. We will further have defined the conditions that must be met to introduce a genetically modified R. buchneri into I. scapularis so that an effective paratransgenesis approach could be devised."
"9499569","Lupus is a devastating disease predominantly affecting young women. Lupus autoimmunity is prototypical of many different autoimmune diseases, which together affects 3-5% of the popula- tion. T cells, whose activation depends on both B cells and innate immune sensing, are pivotal in promoting disease. Despite that T cells are critical in driving virtually all aspects of systemic autoimmune disease, their identity, specificity, function and fate remain very poorly defined. Au- toreactive T cells provide help to autoreactive B cells and also cause tissue damage by target organ infiltration. While we have a deep understanding of the specificity, regulation and fate of autoreactive B cells, the same cannot be said for autoreactive T cells. In particular, we would like to elucidate how self-reactive T cells are regulated by self-tolerance mechanisms and how, upon activation, they contribute to various aspects of autoimmunity. With the current proposal we hope to make significant inroads into this important yet understud- ied area. We will first use a novel strategy to isolate new clones of autoreactive T cells that rec- ognize nuclear components (?ANA T cells?) from both normal and autoimmune prone genetic backgrounds (Aim 1A); this will provide insights into the repertoire of autoimmune B-helper T cell repertoire. We will then clone the TCRs of selected T cells into retroviral expression vectors to make ?retrogenic? (Rg) mice. We will then determine (Aim 1B) how these autoreactive cells develop, are subject to a variety of tolerance mechanisms, and are potentially spontaneously activated. This will be studied according to both the origin of the T cell as well as the context in which the T cell is expressed (normal or autoimmune background). Finally in Aim 1(C), we will convert selected TCRs into full-fledged TCR transgenic (Tg) mice, which will be required for more robust and detailed mechanistic studies. In Aim 2 we will then use these Tg mice T cells to study mechanisms of activation, T-B interaction and Toll-like receptor (TLR) dependence. This will be done by a series of mixed bone marrow chimeras that will allow us to interrogate the fate and function of ANA T cells in a more natural milieu in which the T cells will develop and operate in the context of polyclonal autoimmunity driven by the other cells in the chimera that will vary in expression of cognate BCRs as well as TLR signaling capability. At the conclusion of these studies we will not only have a truly unique set of new tools in the form of clones, Rg mice and Tg mice on normal and autoimmune backgrounds, but we will have very significantly advanced the field in terms of understanding how ANA T cells are activated and regulated, how they promote disease, and how they interact with innate immune signals."
"9565339","A major limiting factor in previous studies of both the asymptomatic and pathological knee is the inability to non-invasively measure three-dimensional skeletal and muscular motion simultaneously. Cine phase contrast (PC) MRI (dynamic MRI) is the only technique currently available that can do just this. Cine-PC MRI, which is a combination of cine and phase contrast MRI, provides a temporal series of anatomic images of all cyclically moving and static structures in the imaging plane.  Therefore, the overall goal of this work is to determine the specific sources of maltracking patterns in patellofemoral (PF) pain. As part of this overall goal, the purpose of this study is to determine how the loss of function in the vasti medialis muscle alters the dynamic control of patellar kinematics in healthy individuals, using cine-PC as the primary measurement tool.  Twenty-three asymptomatic volunteers with no prior history of knee pain, trauma, leg surgery, or contraindications to having an MRI have been enrolled. During the first visit, the PF and tibiofemoral (TF) kinematics were derived from dynamic cine phase contrast velocity data. If the first visit data revealed the presence of a valid exclusion criteria, the subject was removed from the study (n=5, based on the presence of abnormal PF kinemtics); if not, the subject was asked to return within a week for the second segment of the study. For the second visit, the same kinematics were acquired immediately after administering a motor branch block to the VM using 3-5cc of 1% lidocaine. A repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to test the null hypothesis that the post- and pre-injection kinematics were no different across the knee angles of extension. A Kolmogorov-Smirnov test for normality was run. If the data were normally distributed, a repeated measures ANOVA was run using Hotellings T2 test statistic; if not, the non-parametric Friedman's test statistic was used. Upon rejection of the null hypothesis a post-hoc analysis (Wilcoxon signed rank test) was completed to determine at which knee angles the null hypothesis could be rejected. Pearsons correlations between the change in kinematics post-injection and the pre-injection kinematics were quantified at these same knee angles. This was followed by a step-wise linear regression. Significance was set at p0.05.  Post-injection, the maximum lateral shift of the patellar and tibial origins (1.8mm, SD=1.7mm, p=0.003 KA=20 and 2.1mm, SD=2.9mm, p=0.02, KA = 15) and the maximum external tibial rotation (3.7, SD=4.4, p=0.006, KA=20) occurred at similar points in the extension arc. These changes were 3.2 to 4.8 times greater than the subject repeatability. The value of PF tilt trended laterally post-I (max=1.6, KA =15), but significant differences pre- to post-I were not found. No individual reported pain, based on a Visual Analog Scale, following the kinematic trials during visit 1 and visit 2. The lateral shift of the PF origin post-I was significantly correlated with the initial value of PF origins superior displacement in terminal extension (Pearson correlation coefficients (r-values) ranged from 0.47 to 0.48 for knee angles ranging from 10-20, p<0.05).   To relate the kinematic changes seen following a VM block to those seen in PFPS, it is important to understand that there are likely subgroups within the PFPS population, each with unique kinematic alterations of varying etiologies. In a previous study the PFPS cohort was divided into two groups, lateral and non-lateral maltrackers. The lateral maltrackers demonstrated increased PF lateral and superior shift, lateral tilt, flexion, and valgus rotation. The change in kinematics following the nerve block could account for a portion of the lateral shift and tilt seen in the lateral maltrackers. Increased ligament laxity likely would have increased this shift and tilt, as well as increased the patellar ligament length, resulting in the observed PF superior shift (patella alta) in the lateral maltrackers. Patella alta reduces the influence of the femoral groove on PF kinematics in terminal extension, resulting in increased PF lateral shift (as supported by the correlations within this study), lateral tilt, and valgus rotation. Therefore, a combination of VM weakness and generalized ligament laxity could account for the kinematic variations in the lateral maltracking group. These changes would result in higher contact stresses when the patella is forced to re-engage with the femoral sulcus in early flexion and would reduce the overall contact area, both of which would likely leading to PF pain.   The non-lateral maltrackers demonstrated increases in PF flexion and TF internal rotation only, with a trend towards PF medial translation and medial tilt. A larger LTI combined with a normative PF superior location in the non-lateral maltrackers limited lateral PF shift and influenced patellar tilt in this subgroup. Thus, in this sub-group a loss of VM strength likely would have resulted in increased contact force between the lateral femoral sulcus and the patella, resulting in PF pain, without excessive lateral shift and tilt being present. The high LTI and the trend towards medial tilt in the non-lateral maltracking group may help explain the variability in the post-I change in PF lateral tilt. In the presence of a high LTI, a loss of strength in the VMO strength could result in the lateral patellar edge riding up the lateral femoral sulcus, resulting in the observed trend towards medial tilt in the non-lateral maltrackers and the post-I medial tilt observed in some subjects.  The current study provides crucial data for validation of musculoskeletal modeling. Specifically, the estimation of the quadriceps ability to produce a torque on the tibia is complicated by the fact that the patella serves as an intermediary (a dynamic fulcrum) between the quadriceps and tibia. Therefore, the term effective quadriceps moment arm was coined to define the ability of the quadriceps to generate a torque on the tibia. Yet, this property has only been calculated two-dimensionally in the sagittal plane. The post-I external tibial rotation clearly demonstrates that acting through the patella, the VM effective moment arm has a component that results in internal tibial rotation.   This study has advanced the clinical understanding of PFPS by providing a direct in vivo link between VMO weakness in isolation and knee joint kinematic alterations. In doing so it has demonstrated that VMO weakness is most likely a major factor in, but not the sole source of, PF maltracking. Thus, isolated VM strengthening will likely not fully correct PF maltracking in most individuals. In addition, it demonstrated that even with kinematic alterations in the PF and TF joint, pain was not experienced during the post-I trial, indicating that pain may be a factor that develops over time. Combining these findings with past results pertaining to the kinematics and bone shape alterations in individuals with PFPS supports two paths to PFPS in two kinematically unique subgroups. Such knowledge will likely help foster the next generation of treatments for PFPS that focus on first elucidating subject-specific factors leading to PF pain and then devising an intervention plan that specifically targets these factors in order to optimize treatment. Future work is required to provide further evidence on the validity of these paths and extend the current methodology to create a clinical diagnostic tool that will help guide therapeutic or surgical treatments for patients with PF pain.  This work won the prestigious 2011 International Society of Biomechanics Clinical Award and the 2011 American Society of Biomechanics Clinical Award.  Currently, the data from this study is being used as part of a cartilage contact analysis."
"9397374","PROJECT SUMMARY Prion diseases are infectious neurodegenerative disorders caused by PrPSc, a misfolded and aggregated isoform of the cellular prion protein, PrPC. During late disease stages, PrPSc spreads through the CNS, causing neurodegeneration, gliosis, and ultimately death. Earlier studies suggest that prions spread through neuroanatomically connected brain regions, however the mechanisms of prion transport remain poorly defined. Here we propose to investigate the role of exosomes in the intercellular spread of prions. Exosomes are extracellular nanovesicles that originate from the endosomal pathway and are important for intercellular communication, transporting proteins and mRNA to nearby cells. Exosomes harbor infectious prions isolated immortalized cell lines and mice, and these exosomes efficiently cause prion disease in mice. I hypothesize that prions exploit the exosome pathway as the primary mechanism of prion spread into and within the CNS. I will address this hypothesis in three aims using both in vitro and in vivo models. In the first aim, I will define the size of prion aggregates packaged into exosomes using recombinant PrP fibrils and a diverse population of brain-derived prion strains, as well as measure prions in exosomes isolated from prion-infected cells and prion- infected mouse brain. In the second aim, I will manipulate the early vesicular pathway (Hrs in ESCRT-0) in vitro and determine the effect on prion spread between cells using primary neurons, astrocytes, and immortalized neurons in transwell systems. In the third aim, I will manipulate Hrs in the exosome pathway in a cell-specific manner in vivo and investigate the impact on prion neuroinvasion and spread through the CNS. I expect that these studies will elucidate mechanisms of protein aggregate spread that will be critical for understanding protein misfolding diseases and developing novel therapeutic strategies to arrest disease progression."

The ability to make a reliable, detailed characterization of platelet function may help investigators who are studying genetics of inherited platelet disorders. One family with abnormal platelet function and other abnormalities has been described and submitted to the journal Blood for consideration to be published (York Platelet Syndrome, T. Markello et al, authors and collaborators). Another patient has been identified who has a novel platelet disorder that may be a variant of Glanzmann's thrombasthenia. He has been referred to the Undiagnosed Diseases Program (NIH/NHGRI) for further analysis and possible genome sequencing to identify the basis of this disorder.  Characterization of D-Dimer and Related Coagulation Proteins in HIV-Infected Research Subjects Undergoing IL-2 Therapy: During the fifth year of this project, in support of intramural NIH research protocols, we have measured D-dimer levels and numerous coagulation parameters in research subjects who are infected with HIV or who are normal volunteers. We seek to correlate the D-dimer levels with these various parameters to gain insights into the mechanism for the observed elevations in D-dimer levels in HIV infected patients that correlate with increased morbidity and mortality.   Effect of Factor VIII Haplotypes on Inhibitor Development. We have identified a set of  800 DNA samples from patients with severe hemophilia A in an NHLBI repository and have IRB approval to determine their factor VIII protein-coding polymorphisms to determine the effect of factor VIII haplotype on inhibitor development. We expect to complete the DNA sequence determinations in the coming fiscal year, and will see if the effect of protein coding polymorphisms on inhibitor development that was seen in a minority population (African-Americans) can be seen in the population as a whole. We have observed two cases of acquired factor VIII inhibitor in the setting of non-myeloablative stem cell transplantation for sickle cell disease in African-Americans, a report on one of which has now been published."
"9408441","Despite the high prevalence of epilepsy, which affects nearly 4% of the population over their lifetime, roughly one third of afflicted patients are incompletely responsive to anticonvulsant drugs, requiring in severe cases neurosurgical resections or novel approaches such as deep-brain stimulation (DBS). Recently, I helped develop an electrophysiology-based online DBS protocol for seizure detection and interruption in rodent models of absence epilepsy, a form of epilepsy involving aberrant thalamocortical activity. However, like other online DBS procedures which detect seizures as they occur, there was little ability to predict incipient seizures due in large part to limited spatiotemporal resolution of the signal we used, the electrocorticogram (ECoG). ECoG and related electroencephalogram (EEG), being large scale local field potential approaches, do not provide single-cell resolution of neural dynamics that are likely required to obtain predictive information. Over the last decade, the field of brain-machine interface (BMI) has made breakthroughs in neuroscience and engineering by developing methods for multi-electrode array recording of large scale neural spiking activity and efficient reduction of the resultant high-dimensional neural activity to a smaller number of dimensions to effectively control neural prostheses. We predict that this approach will be invaluable for understanding neural dynamics during seizures and stimulation, and for developing predictive algorithms and adaptive DBS protocols.  Therefore, the goal of this project is to precisely characterize thalamocortical neural activity during spontaneous absence seizures and following thalamic stimulation by combining large-scale thalamic and cortical neural recordings, optogenetics, and BMI mathematical techniques. Additionally, the experiments presented in this proposal will use the recorded neural activity to develop adaptive algorithms that both predict oncoming seizure activity and modify stimulation parameters based on the neural state and response to stimulation in real-time. This proposal is aimed towards increasing our understanding of the neural dynamics of epileptic networks and improving the efficacy and safety of online DBS."
"9552559","The mouth is a complex biological ecosystem normally containing over 700 different species of bacteria. Some of these bacteria live in an exopolysacchride matrix biofilm and occupy specific niches in this complex oral environment. Understanding the oral environment and the microbiota that inhabit it will assist in determining their impact on health and disease. There are several studies in critically ill patients demonstrating changes in oral bacteria related to acute illness. Identification of respiratory pathogens in the mouth has led researchers to hypothesize that a relationship exists between the oral cavity and pulmonary infections. Identification of potential pathogens in the oral cavity of patients with severe aplastic anemia could indicate a similar association between oral pathogens and infection in patient who develop respiratory infections that are severe enough to require intubation. This descriptive case-control study will characterize the oral microbiota of patients who have severe aplastic anemia (SAA). Patients will be followed for 1 year after treatment for development of respiratory symptoms that require intubation (cases). The cases will be compared to two groups of controls, namely those SAA patients who did not require intubation that received treatment for SAA and normal healthy volunteers who are age and gender matched. A difference in the oral microbiome will be identified in specimens collected before and after treatment and in those patients who require intubation.  As of this date we have consented 24 participants and have finished sequencing. Results are being prepared for publishing."

The Program has two scientific aims. They are to: 1) Develop a  mechanisms-based understanding of the genetic, cellular, and biochemical processes regulating normal and  malignant hematopoiesis, and 2) Translate basic scientific discoveries into more effective and manageable  therapies. Thematic areas include transcriptional, translational, and epigenetic regulation of normal and  malignant hematopoietic cells; signal transduction in normal and malignant hematopoietic cells; molecular  therapeutics; hematopoietic stem cell biology and transplantation; and immune-based therapies. Program  members are extensive users of CCSG-supported resources (e.g., Clinical Protocol and Data Management,  Biostatistics Core, Clinical Cell and Vaccine Production Facility, Flow Cytometry and Cell Sorting Facility, and  Human Immunology Core) and have extensive collaborations with other Abramson Cancer Center Programs  including Cancer Control, Cancer Therapeutics, Immunobiology, Melanoma and Cutaneous Malignancies,  Radiobiology and Imaging, and Pediatric Oncology. The Program is Co-Led by Dr. Edward Stadtmauer, an  expert in clinical trials of novel therapeutics for hematologic malignancies and bone marrow transplantation,  and Dr. Nancy Speck, an internationally known basic scientist working in the area of hematopoietic stem cells  and leukemia. The Program's 21 members come from five departments (Medicine, Pediatrics, Genetics,  Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, and Cell and Developmental Biology) in the Perelman School of Medicine.  An innovative Hematologic Malignancies Translational Center of Excellence co-led by Dr. Stadtmauer has  catalyzed an already successful Program by adding laboratory, tissue banking, and clinical research personnel  resources as well as pilot grant funding. Prominent examples of Program advances include the demonstration  by Dr. Blobel that the formation of chromatin loops directly activates transcription of globin genes, the  demonstration by Dr. Tong that interaction of the cytokine signaling regulator Lnk with JAK2 is regulated by the  14-3-3 proteins, the reduction of graft versus host disease by CCR5 blockade, reported by a new member, Dr.  Reshef and colleagues, and the application of Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) modified T-cell therapy for  CLL and B-cell ALL, led by Dr. Porter. Weekly seminars, collaborative grant submissions, weekly clinical  working group meetings, and an annual research retreat organized by Drs. Speck and Stadtmauer facilitate  member interactions. Currently, members have research funding totaling $6.7M (annual direct costs) of which  $5M is peer-reviewed and $2.4M is from the NCI.

"9549526","First, canines (n=24) with Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) pneumonia were randomized in a blinded fashion for exchange-transfusion with either 7- or 42-day-old canine commercially available universal donor blood (80 mL/kg in 4 divided doses). These experiments were designed to test the extremes of storage age and transfusion volume. Older blood transfusion increased mortality, the arterial-alveolar oxygen gradient and histological lung damage. Older blood resulted in increased in vivo hemolysis, releasing free iron (in the form of non-transferrin bound iron) and CFH and decreasing haptoglobin plasma levels. Consistent with the vasoconstrictive effect of CFH, older blood increased both systemic and pulmonary pressures. This was the first randomized blinded animal trial showing blood transfused at end of storage period can increase mortality during infection.  Next, we investigated the effect of increasing bacterial doses and severity of infection on the risks associated with age of blood transfused in this canine model. A range of S. aureus bacterial doses were administered and then exchange-transfused with either 7- or 42-day-old canine universal donor blood (80 mL/kg in four divided doses). Without bacterial challenge, levels of CFH and NTBI were significantly higher with older versus fresher blood transfusion but there were no significant differences in measurable injury. With higher-dose bacterial challenge, the elevated NTBI levels declined more rapidly and to a greater extent after transfusion with older versus fresher blood, and older blood was associated with significantly worse shock, lung injury, and mortality. The CFH levels were markedly elevated over days regardless of severity of infection. The augmented in vivo hemolysis of transfused older RBCs, resulting in excess plasma CFH and iron release, appears to require the presence of established infection to worsen outcomes.  These data suggest that transfused older RBCs increases the risks specifically from infection in septic subjects and define an infection dose-response.  During canine bacterial pneumonia with septic shock, but not in controls, older stored RBCs were associated with significantly increased lung injury and mortality. We wondered whether transfusion of older RBCs would cause similar adverse effects during shock and inflammatory injury without infection. Therefore, animals (n=12) were transfused similar quantities of either older (42-day) or fresher (7-day) stored universal donor canine RBCs 2.5 hours after undergoing controlled hemorrhage producing shock. With older transfused RBCs, CFH and NTBI levels increased, but lung injury declined and there was a trend toward lower mortality (18% vs. 50%).  Interestingly, the increased levels of CFH with older blood transfusion were associated with an improved hemodynamic response to hemorrhage-reperfusion, with lowered exogenous norepinephrine requirements and cardiac outputs. This hemodynamic effect is consistent with the ability of CFH to scavenge NO causing vasoconstriction. Thus, in hemorrhagic shock, older RBCs altered resuscitation physiology but did not worsen clinical outcomes. Elevated CFH lowers norepinephrine requirements and cardiac output, ameliorating reperfusion injury. In our infection model, we had previously shown that older blood increases NTBI levels transiently during transfusion and the rapid clearance of iron is associated with increased lung injury and mortality. In contrast, during hemorrhagic shock, NTBI levels persist longer after transfusion, and these persistently increased levels of iron are not associated with worsened outcomes. These preclinical data suggest that, whereas iron derived from older RBCs promotes bacterial growth worsening septic shock mortality during infection, release of CFH and NTBI during hemorrhagic shock is not necessarily harmful.  We next conducted a blinded randomized controlled study of RBC washing in this canine model of transfusion injury. We hypothesized that washing older units of blood before transfusion would improve clinical outcomes by removing older fragile RBCs and prevent increases of CFH and iron, whereas washing fresher units would have no effect on outcome. Twenty-four animals with S. aureus pneumonia, were exchange-transfused with either 7- or 42-day-old washed (commercially available Haemonetics blood cell processor with standard washing procedure) or unwashed canine universal donor blood (80 mL/kg in 4 divided doses). Washing older units of blood improved survival rates, shock score, lung injury, cardiac performance and liver function, and reduced levels of NTBI, possibly by lysing and washing away older cells and supernatant. In contrast, washing fresh blood worsened all these same clinical parameters and increased CFH levels. Our data suggest that fresh blood should not be washed routinely because washing induces sub-lethal membrane damage to the RBC and, in a setting of established infection, washed RBCs are prone to lyse, release CFH, and result in worsened clinical outcomes. These findings, along with our previous studies, indicate that transfusion of fresh blood in infected subjects results in less hemolysis, CFH, and iron release, and is less toxic than transfusion of older blood in critically ill infected subjects. However, if older blood must be used during established infection, washing prevents elevations in plasma circulating iron and improves survival and lessens multiple organ injury.  We next examined the results of altering volume, washing, and age of RBCs. Animals were transfused with increasing volumes (5-10, 20-40, or 60-80 mL/kg) of either 42- or 7-day-old RBCs (n=36) or 80 mL/kg of either unwashed or washed RBCs with increasing storage age (14, 21, 28, or 35 days) (n=40). All volumes transfused (5-80 mL/kg) of 42-day-old RBCs resulted in like (i.e., not significantly different) increases in iron, CFH, lung injury, and mortality rates after transfusion. Transfusion of 80 mL/kg of RBCs stored for 14, 21, 28 and 35 days resulted in increased CFH and NTBI in between levels found at 7 and 42 days of storage. However, washing RBCs of intermediate ages (14-35 days) does not alter NTBI and CFH levels or mortality rates. Thus, our preclinical data suggest that any volume of 42-day-old blood potentially increases risks during established infection. In contrast, even massive volumes of 7-day-old blood result in minimal CFH and NTBI levels and risks. In contrast to the extremes of storage, washing blood stored for intermediate ages does not alter risks of transfusion or NTBI and CFH clearance.  We completed our investigation into whether haptoglobin therapy improves outcome after blood transfusion with different RBC storage ages as well as during sepsis without transfusion. Transfusion and bacterial sepsis are both independent potential sources of elevated plasma CFH. Increased CFH levels after transfusion and during sepsis have both been associated with worse outcomes in animal models and humans. Haptoglobin binds CFH and promotes its clearance. This data is currently being analyzed.  We are currently investigating the role of the temperature at which blood it stored for transfusion. According to FDA regulations, blood can be stored between 1-6C. We have shown in canine as well as human stored blood that cell free hemoglobin increases significantly as blood is stored as warmer temperatures (4C and 6C) compared to colder storage (2C). We also have found evidence that Chromium labelled red blood cells to determine viability post transfusion initially showed warmer RBCs having higher viability until we accounted for the loss associated with the process of labelling. This work is on going."
"9452258","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Epidemiologic studies are critical for understanding the diverse drivers of enteric infections and malnutrition, which lead to recurrent diarrheal illnesses and poor growth among children in low-resource settings. To accelerate the translation of population-based data into policy-ready, actionable evidence, novel epidemiologic methods have recently been developed to assess the generalizability of results and estimate the impact of potential interventions from observational data. In this K01 Mentored Research Scientist Development Award application, Dr. Elizabeth T. Rogawski, an Assistant Professor in Public Health Sciences at the University of Virginia (UVA), proposes to apply these innovative methods to inform the implementation of results from two multisite observational studies of enteric infections and two single-site randomized intervention trials in South Africa and Tanzania. The observational studies are MAL-ED, an 8-site birth cohort study of enteric infections, diarrhea, and child development, and GEMS, a 7-site case-control study of moderate-to-severe diarrhea. Specifically, Dr. Rogawski will: 1) identify site-specific social and environmental factors that modify the impact of risk factors for diarrhea and poor growth in MAL-ED and translate effect estimates to GEMS sites using inverse-probability weighting methods; 2) estimate the impact of realistic public health interventions to reduce diarrheal risk and improve child growth from the observational data using the parametric g-formula; and 3) estimate the impact of interventions assessed in the randomized trials of a drinking water quality intervention (South Africa) and a multifactorial child health intervention (Tanzania) at the other MAL-ED and GEMS sites. Key risk factors and potential targets of intervention include water, sanitation, and hygiene-associated factors, enteric pathogens, antimicrobial use, macro- and micronutrients, and illnesses. Dr. Rogawski proposes a career development plan that includes mentorship, fieldwork, coursework, publications, and presentations. Her proposal will be supervised by an outstanding mentoring team with complementary methodological, substantive, and clinical skills. The wealth of research and mentorship experience, robust training infrastructure, and longstanding international collaborations at UVA make this institution the ideal environment to support these activities. Her goals for the award are to become an expert in enteric infections and environmental enteropathy, develop proficiency in novel epidemiologic causal inference methods that are relevant to implementation research, and successfully transition to independence Through an academic career in epidemiology maintain an international research program in pediatric infectious diseases based in the US, while developing . , she plans to novel analytic methods to facilitate the presentation of impactful epidemiologic results. The K01 Mentored Research Scientist Development Award will facilitate her transition to independence as an investigator who bridges the gap between epidemiology and public health policy implementation to reduce infectious disease burden and improve global child development."
"9481602","Abstract Primate lentiviruses have become highly adapted to their respective natural hosts and species- specific variations in host proteins that are required for or that inhibit lentivirus replication limit their tropism. This has protected humans from cross-species transmissions but has also hindered the development of animal models for HIV-1. Investigating how primate lentiviruses interact with cell host proteins allow us to understand the changes required for these viruses to colonize a new species and potentially manipulate their tropism. The goals of this proposal are to determine the requirements in HIV-1 and SIV envelope glycoproteins (Envs) to efficiently use macaque CD4 without compromising their neutralization phenotype. This study will reveal the role of CD4 variation in shaping envelope glycoprotein (Env) adaptation during lentiviral transmission between primates and impact the development of viruses with expanded tropism that will be useful in macaque models for AIDS."
"9438008","Abstract: The duration of antibody responses varies widely with the specific vaccine or infection. The specific features of the immunogen and host responses that are responsible for these differences remain poorly understood. In this application, we describe two transcription factors of the BTB/POZ family which exert opposing effects on the duration of antibody production. The first of these factors, Zbtb20, promotes plasma cell survival and is required for primary long-term antibody responses when aluminum salts, but not Toll-like receptor ligands are used as the adjuvant. The second factor, Zbtb32, promotes plasma cell death and limits the duration of antibody production following memory B cell recall responses, but not primary antibody responses. Based on these findings, we propose to establish the cellular events that explain how adjuvants influence the duration of immunity, and to uncover the physiological consequences to the diversity of antibody responses when recall responses persist for too long. Moreover, we propose to identify the molecular mechanisms of how Zbtb20 and Zbtb32 function to control the duration of humoral immunity."

"9552568","Traditional identification of molds is challenging, cumbersome, and time-consuming, relying on non-specific phenotypic characteristics from culture or expensive and specialized DNA sequencing methods. MALDI-TOF MS has revolutionized clinical microbiology laboratories worldwide, enabling rapid identification of bacteria and yeast. This technology, however, has not been readily applied to mold identification due to technical challenges in developing an efficient protein extraction method and the limited availability of clinically comprehensive databases.  Recently, we developed and optimized a simple protein extraction procedure for molds and constructed a highly stringent database comprising 410 individual isolates representing 90 genera and 220 species for the rapid identification of molds by MALDI-TOF MS. The NIH Mold Database is the most comprehensive database developed to date for mold identification and has filled a huge diagnostic gap in the field of clinical microbiology. The NIH Mold Database has now been shared with >100 clinical microbiology laboratories worldwide in an effort to improve the diagnosis of invasive fungal infections by providing faster identification (within 30 minutes of growth detection as opposed to weeks) that in turn can guide optimal antifungal therapy.  During this fiscal year, an eight-center national controlled study that evaluated the clinical performance and accuracy of two fungal databases (the NIH Mold Database and the Bruker Fungi Database) against 80 clinical mold isolates has come to a close. This study has highlighted important (previously undetermined) factors required for the uniform implementation of MALDI-TOF MS for the routine mold identification in clinical microbiology laboratories"
"9549425","The immune responses to Pneumocystis are poorly understood, but cytokines may play a role in both clearing Pneumocystis infection and in the hypoxia associated with Pneumocystis pneumonia that may be exacerbated following initiation of therapy.  We are using immunodeficient mouse models, especially the CD40L KO mouse, as well as immunocompetent C57BL/6J mice to further evaluate the role of individual cytokines and other immunoregulatory molecules in modulating Pneumocystis infection.  We have developed a real time PCR assay to quantitate Pneumocystis over a wide dynamic range, and are currently examining Pneumocystis infection in healthy animals to better understand immune responses in the normal host.  Using microarrays, we have been able to identify genes that are differentially expressed during Pneumocystis infection in healthy compared to immunodeficient mice; the majority of differentially expressed genes are related to the immune system.  Immunohistochemical studies of the lungs done in parallel have demonstrated that there is an influx of CD4 cells and macrophages at 5 weeks, and, surprisingly, an influx of B cells at 6 weeks in immunocompetent mice but not CD40L KO mice.  Microarray studies suggest that the B cells persist through at least 10 weeks, well after the infection has been cleared.  We have extended these studies to examine immune responses in other immunodeficient mice, including those with defective innate immune responses, such as Myd88 knockout mice which are deficient in TLR signals, and CDld KO mice, which lack NKT cells.  Our studies have shown that these mice are not susceptible to uncontrolled Pneumocystis infection, suggesting that neither TLR signaling, nor NKT cells are critical to controlling Pneumocystis infection.  In collaboration with Philip Murphy, Michail Lionakis, and their groups, we have examined changes in expression of a variety of chemokine and chemokine receptor genes, using Taqman real-time PCR assays, and have been able to identify CCR2 and its ligands as potentially important in the response to Pneumocystis infection.  However, in examining the susceptibility of CCR2 knock-out mice to Pneumocystis infection, we found that they are able to clear infection similar to wild-type animals.  We also examined CX3CR1 knock-out mice for susceptibility to Pneumocystis infection, since CX3CR1 and its ligand identify alternately activated macrophages and are critical to clearance of another fungus, Candida, in mouse models.  These mice were again able to clear Pneumocystis infection with kinetics similar to wild-type mice.  Using microarray analysis of purified CD4 cells isolated from lungs of Pneumocystis-infected mice, we were able to show that CXCR6 is preferentially upregulated compared to cells from uninfected animals, and by Q-PCR that both CXCR6 and its ligand, CXCL16, are unregulated in lung tissue from immunocompetent Pneumocystis-infected mice. We are currently examining the role of CXCR6 in controlling Pneumocystis infection through use of CXCR6 knock-out mice.   We are examining the kinetics of immune responses in the lung of healthy animals exposed to Pneumocystis, using flow cytometry. We have found that interferon-gamma, and less predictably, IL-17, expression are increased in lymphocytes of the lung, primarily CD4 cells, during Pneumocystis infection and clearance, suggesting that Th1 and Th17 CD4+ T cells may play a role in clearing infection. Immunodeficient CD40L KO mice did not show changes in either of these populations during Pneumocystis infection. In follow-up, we found that IL-17A knockout mice are able to clear Pneumocystis infection, thus demonstrating that IL-17 is not critical to control of Pneumocystis infection. We have extended these studies to demonstrate that Th2 and Treg cells show minimal changes in in the lung during Pneumocystis infection in healthy mice, and that an anti-interferon-gamma antibody administered to immunocompetent mice causes a shift from Th1 to Th17 responses, but does not impact control of infection., with kinetics of clearance that are similar to untreated controls.   We have recently examined the contribution of beta-glucans in cysts to the inflammatory response to Pneumocystis.  We have demonstrated that, similar to other pathogenic fungi, glucans are to a large extent masked by surface proteins in 3 Pneumocystis species (P. murina, P. carinii, and P. jirovecii). Moreover, we have shown, by comparing infected mice treated with caspofungin, an inhibitor of beta 1,3 glucan synthase, to untreated mice, that beta-glucans are major contributors to the inflammatory response to Pneumocystis.  We are also examining the response of dendritic cells to the most abundant Pneumocystis antigens, the major surface glycoprotein (MSG).  Finally, we are performing reconstitution studies in CD40KO mice, to try to identify which cells are critical to the mounting an effective immune response against Pneumocystis.  For these studies we use CD45 allelic variants as donors to allow us to track transferred cells.  We have been able to show that unfractionated spleen cells from immunocompetent mice are able to clear Pneumocystis infection, and are currently examining which subpopulations of cells can confer this protection. Preliminary studies suggest that B cells play an important role in conferring long-lasting protection.  We are further examining the role of B cells by performing immune reconstitution studies using B cells that are quasi-monoclonal, to help determine if antibody production or, alternatively, other properties of B cells, such as antigen presentation, are critical to controlling Pneumocystis infection.  It is hoped that these studies will provide insights into the mechanisms critical for control of Pneumocystis infection in the healthy host, and may provide mechanisms for increasing clearance of Pneumocystis or decreasing the inflammation that may be causing hypoxia."
"9555573","The dramatic increase in the use of interventional spine procedures and the rising health care costs over the past decade have raised lots of questions about the utilization and outcomes of treatments for back and neck pain. Several articles have addressed some concerning scenarios related to spinal surgeries and catastrophic adverse events after epidural steroid injections have been reported, related to steroid use.    The purpose of this study is to describe and characterize the treatment of back and neck pain, while examining temporal and geographical trends, physician specialty, and setting variations. We will characterize treatment trajectories in newly diagnosed back and neck pain patients and identify efficient treatment paths and potential gateways to high cost and utilization. The characterization of patients treatment paths will include tracking of manual and percutaneous treatments, use of opioids, imaging utilization, surgical procedures, and safety events. We will examine the outcomes and adverse events following interventional spinal procedures by tracking patients for at least one year after their procedures.  Identifying efficient and safe treatment paths for back pain will lead to better guidelines for back pain management. A characterization of the outcomes and side effects of interventional spinal procedures will help patients and physicians make more informed decisions about treatment options.  Data  This project currently focuses on Medicare administrative health records for patients diagnosed with back pain between 2000-2013. An interagency agreement to access these data has been established between NIH and CMS.  Since the previous annual report, we have achieved the following:  Renewed our seat for access to a CMS virtual research data center (VRDC) that allows the analysis of CMS data in SAS, on CMS servers.   Produced preliminary results based on a subset of the data of interest and evaluated the feasibility of future work. Presented preliminary results at academic conferences and meetings.   Obtained access to CMS Carrier, Inpatient, Outpatient, and Part D files for the years 2000-2013 for almost 47 million patients with diagnoses of back pain.  Continued collaborations with academic partners.   Identified codes of diagnoses, procedures, drugs, complications, and outcomes relevant to our projects.  Additional data runs have been conducted on the updated dataset and cohort that focus on patient demographics and numbers of injections over the period under study. Differential complication rates by steroid type and injection approach are being examined. A published analysis explored the use of injections, surgical interventions, and physical therapy utilization in a sub-cohort of patients with spondylolisthesis. Preliminary results have been presented at Grand Rounds style conferences.  Publications generated by this year's research: Sclafani JA, Constantin A, Ho PS, Akuthota V, Chan L.

"9549552","Project 1: In this study, we will expose pregnant rhesus macaques to ZIKV in the first, second, or third trimesters of their 165-day gestational period. Following exposure, we will investigate fetal brain development and evolution of brain injury using serial fetal brain imaging (MRI and ultrasound), and monitor the appearance of a maternal serum marker of fetal brain injury. We will also sample the amniotic fluid to assess viral replication. Postnatally, we will humanely euthanize one newborn/dam pair from each cohort for detailed viral pathologic studies. We will then longitudinally observe the surviving infants for neurological abnormalities and the persistence of viremia.  Project 2: We developed a supportive critical care model in 5 Kg Indian Origin Rhesus Macaques under biosafety level (BSL) 2 conditions. In this model, animals are provided care and physiologic monitoring similar to that provided to humans in the intensive care unit. Animals are deeply sedated, placed on mechanical ventilation, and closely monitored by trained bedside technicians. In this setting fluid status, serum electrolyte and glucose levels, and acid-base status can be frequently monitored and closely adjusted. Similarly, this model allows for titration of continuous infusion of multiple vasopressors to maintain blood pressure and frequent dosing of medications such as empiric antibiotics and stress-dose steroids which are standard of care in humans with vasopressor-refractory shock. This level of care cannot be provided to awake animals with tethered indwelling vascular catheters.  Measurement of physiologic parameters including cardiac output and pulmonary artery occlusion pressure (PAOP) allows one to differentiate between the 4 categories of shock (i.e., hypovolemic, cardiogenic, obstructive, and distributive), which is essential to optimizing clinical management of severe infections. The contribution of the different categories of shock to EVD pathophysiology remains incompletely characterized. The pulmonary artery (PA) catheter utilized in this model remains the gold standard for assessing volume status and physiology of shock in humans. Specifically, the PA catheter provides a direct measure of cardiac output and an estimate of ventricular pre-load (intravascular volume status) and peripheral vascular resistance (determination of peripheral vasodilation), which can be intermittently assessed at the bedside to guide blood pressure management with titration of intravenous fluids and vasopressors. The PA catheter has been safely implemented in this model and provides reliable physiologic data consistent with those observed in humans."

"9549458","The study is a population based analysis of genetic variation of blood group antigens in three defined, ancient and still conserved Ethiopian sub-populations. Blood samples will be collected in distinct remote areas of Ethiopia and be analyzed at DTM/CC/NIH using standard serologic methods and modern molecular genotyping systems. Samples of red blood cells, plasma, DNA and cDNA will also be stored for future additional study, like high throughput sequencing. The study will allow a systematic analysis of the distribution of blood group antigens in three Ethiopian sub-populations. The populations are known to differ in malaria and sickle cell disease prevalence and environmental factors like other tropical infectious diseases and oxygen pressure. The ethnic group living in the Ethiopian highland is possibly exposed to low oxygen pressure for the longest period of any human population. We expect to describe differences associated with environmental influences (high altitude, low land tropical, and low land desert). We also expect to detect new alleles that may allow novel insight into the correlation of genotypes and phenotypes. The study was examined by the IRB of NHLBI and approved through PCSC on 1/11/2011 as NIH protocol 11-CC-N086."
"9393990","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The Host-Microbe Core (HMC) is comprised of two components ? the Gnotobiotic component (GBC) and Enteric Microbiology component (EMC). They synergize in the isolation, cultivation and analysis of microbiota by biochemical and sequencing methods with the concomitant analysis of microbes and their communities in vivo using our state-of-the-art gnotobiotic facility. Recent advances in the analysis of the commensal microbiota and an increasing appreciation for the role of the microbiota in the vital functions of the mammalian host have put the studies of host-microbe interactions at the forefront of many areas of the life sciences. This is especially true for studies of the normal physiology of the gut and pathophysiology of disease states such as IBD, which has been linked to disruptions in the host-commensal mutualism. The ability to analyze the composition and structure of the microbiota, as well as its functional properties and ex vivo culturing conditions, is a base requirement for building a successful research center devoted to studying digestive diseases. Moreover, to be in the vanguard of these increasingly inter-disciplinary research fields, DDRCC scientists need access to a reliable mechanism for testing their ideas in in vivo experiments in animals colonized with defined microbiota ? gnotobiotic mice. They are also in need of germ-free (GF) animals to use as controls for studies of the role of microbes in disease development. As a result, the HMC is committed to: (1) Providing DDRCC researchers with services that reflect their needs, are available on campus, and are competitively priced compared to commercial services; and (2) Further development of the HMC to meet both current and anticipated demands. The HMC not only provides valuable expertise to DDRCC users for experiment planning, troubleshooting and discussion of the results but is also integrated with the other DDRCC cores to augment these capabilities. The HMC together with the Integrated Translational Research (ITR) Core are essential for providing cells, tissues, and patient samples to investigators for establishing experimental models. Likewise, the Enteric Microbiology component of the HMC provides high-quality, customized service for cultivation- dependent and -independent analyses of complex gut microbiomes, and in conjunction with the Computational Analysis and Modeling Resource (CAMR) component of the Administrative Core provides assistance and instruction in the analysis of large datasets. Thus, the HM Core has had tremendous impact in enabling DDRCC members to advance knowledge in the DDRCC's thematic areas that focus on the study of IBD, host- microbe interactions, mucosal immunology and inflammation. Of the 306 DDRCC-acknowledged publications over the past funding cycles, 59 (~20%) cited the HMC as the primary core that they used. Further underscoring the integration of DDRCC Cores, the HMC was also listed as a secondary core for an additional 24 pubs, totaling 83 or 28% of the total publications that helped by the DDRCC over the past funding period."
"9552552","Understanding of factors associated with recovery following allogeneic transplant can increase the likelihood that patients will ultimately return to a normal, productive life. Existing research regarding the recovery of adult survivors of allogeneic HSCT indicates that many patients experience difficulties in a variety of Health Related Quality of Life (HRQL) domains. A critical issue which has remained unexamined concerns the extent to which domains improve, remain static, or perhaps even deteriorates with the passage of time after allogeneic HSCT.   This prospective longitudinal study accrued research participants once they have survived a minimum of three years from date of transplant.  The protocol provides a mechanism to examine the health status and health outcomes of long term survivors ( 3 years following allogeneic HSCT). Patients were approached for participation during their annual transplant follow-up at the Clinical Center. Patients were evaluated at approximately yearly intervals beyond the first time point within 60 days of their annual transplant follow-up. This parallel with their medical care will allow for potential work in the future comparing biological and self-reported markers of recovery.  Questionnaires address topics such as HRQL, functional status, psychosocial adjustment, symptom distress, fatigue, spirituality and sleep quality.  The study has closed to enrollment and is currently undergoing data anlaysis. 227 HSCT survivors were screened and 173 enrolled.Results will be discussed with respect to their implications for both the encouragement of realistic expectations for recovery following allogeneic HSCT as well as the development of intervention."

"9393989","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Over the past 75 years, researchers in digestive diseases at the University of Chicago have made crucial advances in the understanding of clinical disease behavior and progression, therapeutic efficacy, disease monitoring, cost-effectiveness assessment, genetics of IBD, epigenetics of IBD, microbial influences on gastrointestinal function, immune mechanisms, normal physiology and pathogenesis of luminal diseases. The investigators in the DDRCC have increasingly recognized that a comprehensive understanding of the clinical behavior, phenotype, epidemiology and pathophysiology of human disease requires the analysis of clinical data, analysis of human cells and tissues and the establishment/advancement of human model systems and cellular experiments. The ITR core was created to enable translational research by providing the infrastructure and means to integrate clinical information with experimental data relating to the microbiota, the intestinal tissue, the immune system and the genetic and epigenetic make-up. The ITR Core has the singular goal of establishing a centralized service to provide consultative and hands-on technical expertise to conduct associated human studies, key clinical database information that could be used for clinical trials recruitment, outcomes analysis, therapeutic efficacy studies, and in conjunction with biospecimen recruitment, a source of well-phenotyped samples as reagents for basic science and translational research. The Specific Aims of the ITR Core are summarized as follows: (1) to provide services for human biospecimen-based study design and cellular analysis; (2) to provide the infrastructure and services to optimize clinical database utilization and (3) to provide the infrastructure and services to optimize human biospecimen utilization. In particular, the ITR Core has worked steadfastly to optimize consultation services for human study design, create a dynamic mechanism to access and assess clinical data and to create an efficient workflow for patient and biospecimen recruitment. All improvements have been integrally supported by the University of Chicago and collaborative resources to address the needs of DDRCC investigators and to create an ITR Core that functions as a critical resource for the other DDRCC Cores. Since September 1, 2009, 27 DDRCC members (53% of membership) have utilized the ITR Core and 2568 Genesys IBD Registry and 603 Celiac Disease Registry patients have been recruited, with a total of 4477 patient recruited through the ITR Core for all GI studies in the past 5 years. The ITR Core has also built a repository of biospecimens to facilitate the rapid generation of data which includes 16,291 biospecimens on 1002 patients, including whole blood DNA, serum, biopsy RNA, biopsy DNA, flash frozen biopsy samples and FFPE tissues. The ITR core will continue to build on the infrastructural foundation established over the last 4 years to meet the growing and changing needs of DDRCC investigators for clinical database information and well-phenotyped biospecimens. The ultimate goal of the ITR Core is to remain an integral, essential resource for the advancement of research in understanding human physiology, human digestive disease pathogenesis and future therapeutic development."
"9535730","Project Summary  The Tobacco and Environmental Carcinogenesis Program, which received ?Outstanding? merit in its first  CCSG submission in 2010, assembles researchers committed to elucidating how exposures to tobacco and  environmental carcinogens cause cancer and how these exposures can be mitigated by risk reduction,  intervention, and communication strategies. Exposure to carcinogens represents a major cause of human  cancers yet individuals who have the same exposures do not all get cancer in the end-organ. This suggests  that significant inter-individual differences exist in cancer susceptibility. Understanding the basis of these  differences can lead to precision risk reduction, which represents the translational impact of the Program. The  foci of the Program is tobacco related cancers (e.g., lung) and asbestos exposure and mesothelioma, with a  developing effort in UV/light exposure and melanoma. Each area provides rich opportunities for inter-  Programmatic research. The Program owes its translational and transdisciplinary vision to Co-Leaders Drs.  Robert Schnoll, a leader in tobacco control, and Trevor Penning, an expert in environmental carcinogenesis.  The scientific aims of the Program are to: 1) Elucidate the pathways underlying exposure risk (e.g., risk factors  for tobacco dependence; environmental exposures and risk for mesothelioma and melanoma); 2) Identify the  mechanisms linking exposure to disease (e.g., steps in multi-stage carcinogenesis); 3) Evaluate methods for  exposure and risk reduction (e.g., tobacco cessation treatments; asbestos remediation; UV light protection);  and 4) Test methods of risk communication (e.g., tobacco marketing, regulatory science). Program members  collaborate extensively, particularly with the Cancer Control and Cancer Therapeutics Programs, on studies of  tobacco use, health communication, and smoking cessation, with the Cancer Therapeutics and Immunobiology  Programs on investigations in thoracic oncology and immunotherapies, and with the Melanoma and Cutaneous  Malignancies Program on UV/light issues. Seminal contributions during the project period include validating the  first genetically-informed biomarker for personalized smoking cessation treatment and identifying novel  mechanisms by which multi-organ carcinogens (e.g., polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons) in tobacco smoke and  the environment are metabolically activated. The intra- and inter-Programmatic environment is facilitated by  active mentoring, symposia, working groups, and pilot grants. The 15 members, who are from five departments  and two schools, have $5.9M in external funding (annual direct costs); $5.8M is peer-reviewed and $2.6M is  NCI-funded. Collaborative grants include an NCI P50 Tobacco Center of Regulatory Science (with Cancer  Control), a P30 Center of Excellence in Environmental Toxicology (CEET; with Cancer Control), a  Pharmacogenomics Research Network U01 (with Cancer Control), and an NIH P42 Superfund Research  Program on asbestos.

"9552563","We hypothesize that abnormalities in the oral microbiome will be detectable on admission, and that these will also rapidly renormalize with abstinence and resumption of ordinary diet and oral hygiene. If not, the findings in this study could point to the need for other interventions, such as administration of probiotics. Twenty evaluable participants admitted to the Clinical Center for alcohol detoxification will be enrolled. All patients will be admitted under the Unit and Clinic Evaluation, Screening, Assessment, and Management protocol (14-AA-0181), which includes adults 18 years of age or older seeking treatment for severe alcohol use disorders. Oral (tongue brushings) and gut (stool) specimens will be collected daily until for the first week. And then once a week for 28 days. Demographic characteristics, detailed drinking and dietary histories, measures of addiction severity, comorbid mental disorders, and metabolic indicators of other disease will be collected for correlation with microbiological results. Dietary records will include use of probiotics. Exclusion criteria include use of antibiotics, corticosteroids or immunosuppressive agents within the past month. Informed consent will be obtained after consent for the screening and treatment protocol (14-AA-0181) and in accordance with policies protecting participants with impaired decision-making. Microbial identification will include 16S rRNA analysis and a validated Next Generation Sequencing analysis pipelines. Statistical comparisons between each patients oral and gut microbiome samples will be evaluated and all results from this population will also be compared to published microbiomes in both healthy volunteers as well as existing data from alcohol dependent individuals. Participants will be compensated for research-related discomfort and inconveniences in accordance with NIH guidelines.   This study has finished accrual."
"9399679","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): While the prevalence of childhood obesity may have started to plateau for some groups of children, other groups such as low-income and minority children are experiencing increases in childhood obesity. These growing disparities may be linked to unanswered questions regarding the home environment and childhood obesity. For example, research has shown that healthful food availability/accessibility in the home, frequent family meals, and authoritative parenting style are associated with healthful dietary intake, bette psychosocial health, and fewer unhealthy weight control behaviors in youth, but findings are inconsistent across studies with minority and low-income families. These conflicting findings suggest that mixed- methods studies are needed for an in-depth examination of the home environments of diverse families to identify potential explanatory mechanisms of childhood obesity that may have been overlooked in prior research. In addition, previous studies have not included state-of-the-art measures that may help illuminate factors in the home environment that differ by race/ethnicity. The primary objective of this study is to identify how familial factors, including interpersonal relationships that exist between family members, of racially/ethnically and socioeconomically diverse children act as risk or protective factors for predicting childhood obesity. To achieve this objective, a two-phased incremental mixed-methods approach will be used. Phase I (yrs. 1-2) will include in-home observations of diverse families (n=120; 20 each of African American, American Indian, Hispanic, Hmong, Somali and white families) to identify individual, dyadic (i.e., parent/child; siblings), and familial factors that are associated with, o moderate associations with, childhood obesity. The in-home observations, using our community-based participatory research partners, will include: (1) an interactive observational family task and family interview; (2) ecological momentary assessment (EMA) 17 of parent stress, mood and parenting practices; and (3) child accelerometry and 24-hour dietary recalls. Using state-of-the-art measures, such as EMA, will allow for identifying within-day fluctuations in parenting practices or parent stress levels, which may help to identify nuances within the home environment that amplify or exacerbate childhood obesity risk. Results from the in-home observations will be used for rich analyses and to inform the development of a culturally-appropriate survey in Phase II (yrs. 3- 5). The survey will be administered at two time points to a diverse sample of up to two caregivers (n=2400) of children ages 5-7. Individual, dyadic, and familial factors that are longitudinally associated with child BMIz score and weight-related behaviors will be identified. Phase I and II recruitment will occur via the electronic Primary Care Research Network in Minnesota primary care clinics (n=82). This comprehensive evaluation of diverse home environments will identify potential factors that increase childhood obesity risk in order to create culturally-tailored interventions that will be effective in reducing childhood obesty disparities."
"9549446","We previously developed an ICU supported canine model of B. anthracis toxin shock, which has provided essential insights into the pathogenic effects of LT and ET. Using this model we then demonstrated that during LT and ET challenges alone or together, while the benefit with standard hemodynamic was limited, Raxibacumab provided substantial benefit, reducing fluid and vasopressor needs and improving survival even if administered after the onset of hypotension. The goal of the present study is to determine whether AIG also augments standards hemodynamic support during LT and ET challenge together in this canine model.    Studies have been completed examining the effects of AIG in this canine model and a manuscript has been submitted an is presently under its first revision for Intensive Care Medicine Experimental.  Work from this study was presented at the 2015 International Conference of the American Thoracic Society."
"9549557","The National Quality Forum (NQF) endorsed and CMS has instituted a performance measure to be applied to patients presenting with sepsis termed the Severe Sepsis and Septic Shock Early Management Bundle (SEP-1). The primary purpose of this performance measure is to decrease hospital mortality and costs of care related to sepsis, severe sepsis and septic shock. The performance measure includes five interventions (both treatments and measures) related to the hemodynamic management of patients with sepsis: In adults with severe sepsis, initial lactate level measurement must be performed within 3 hours of presentation, and repeat lactate level measurement must be performed within 6 hours of presentation, if initial lactate level is elevated. In adults with septic shock, resuscitation with 30ml/kg crystalloid fluids must be performed within 3 hours of presentation. Within 6 hours of presentation of septic shock, adults must receive vasopressors if hypotension persists after fluid administration. Also, if hypotension persists after fluid administration or if the initial lactate level is > 4 mmol/L, then a volume status and tissue perfusion assessment must be performed. According to the CMS performance measure, assessment of volume status and tissue perfusion requires either a focused physical exam (vital signs, cardiopulmonary exam, capillary refill evaluation, peripheral pulse assessment and skin examination  all must be performed), or any two of the following: measure CVP, measure ScvO2, bedside cardiovascular ultrasound, or passive leg raise or fluid challenge. At present CMS requires that providers report on their institutions use of the interventions in this performance measure. Subsequently, however, CMS will require that providers complete all interventions. This performance measure is complex and requires substantial hospital resources to achieve compliance. We will perform a systematic review and meta-analysis that will focus on the evidence supporting the use of each of these hemodynamic interventions in decreasing mortality from sepsis, as well as the length of hospital stay, organ failure and cost of care."
"9569190","This project involves the creation and and use of Choosing Healthplans All Together (CHAT), a small group decision exercise designed to give the public a voice in priority setting in efforts to make health care costs sustainable. It is intended to be used for research, policy and teaching purposes. Departments of Insurance in various states in the U.S. have used CHAT to determine public opinion about what should be included in basic health insurance packages for the uninsured. Some municipalities have used it to assess public priorities for direct service delivery to the uninsured.In 2014, the results of a CHAT exercise designed to ask cancer patients and their families about priorities for Medicare-covered insurance benefits for advanced cancer patients was published.In 2016 we reported the priorities of low income communities in Michigan and Missouri regarding patient-centered outcomes research. A number of CHAT projects are in progress and reaching completion.  One is a project designed to ascertain the priorities of Swiss citizens for insurance benefits in various regions of Switzerland. The latest project is being conducted in cooperation with staff at the Wits School of Public Health in Johannesburg, South Africa. This project will engage members of the community of Bushbuckridge in the Agincourt Health and Population Unit in defining a package of benefits for universal health coverage in South Africa."
"9549509","During the fiscal year, we accomplished the following:  1. Solved the NMR structure of calmodulin bound to estrogen receptor- (ER). Prior work from our laboratory identified and characterized the functional interactions of calmodulin with non-classic calmodulin target proteins, including IRS-1 (insulin receptor substrate-1), IRS-2, IQGAP1, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), p21Cip, androgen receptor, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR, also termed HER1) and ER. Calmodulin binds directly to ER (which stimulates tumorigenesis in ER(+) breast carcinoma) in a Ca2+-dependent manner. We documented that calmodulin binding both promotes the stability of ER by sequestering it away from the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway and is necessary for estrogen-stimulated transcriptional activity of ER. We previously identified the calmodulin-binding domain on ER. In collaboration with Jim Ames, we solved the NMR structures of the full-length calmodulin bound to two ER peptides. The two lobes of calmodulin bind to the same site on two separate ER molecules. Calmodulin binds two molecules of ER in a 1:2 complex and stabilizes ER dimerization. Full-length calmodulin increased the ability of estrogen to enhance transcriptional activation by ER of endogenous estrogen responsive genes. By contrast, expression of the individual lobes of calmodulin, either the N- or C-lobe, abrogated estrogen-stimulated transcription. These data suggest that small molecules that selectively disrupt the interaction of calmodulin with ER may be useful in the therapy of breast carcinoma.  2. Showed that knockdown of IQGAP1 in endothelial cells by siRNA abolished oxidized 1-palmitoyl-2-arachidonoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidylcholine (OxPAPC)-induced enlargement of VE-cadherin-positive adherens junctions, suppressed peripheral accumulation of actin polymerization regulators and attenuated remodeling of the peripheral actin cytoskeleton. Inhibition of OxPAPC-induced barrier enhancement by IQGAP1 knockdown was due to suppressed Rac1 and Cdc42 activation. Expression of an IQGAP1 truncated mutant showed that the GTPase regulatory domain (GRD) of IQGAP1 was essential for the OxPAPC-induced membrane localization of cortactin, adherens junction proteins VE-cadherin and p120-catenin as well as for EC permeability response. IQGAP1knockdown attenuated the protective effect of OxPAPC against thrombin-induced cell contraction, cell junction disruption and EC permeability. These results demonstrate for the first time the role of IQGAP1 as a critical transducer of OxPAPC-induced Rac1/Cdc42 signaling to the actin cytoskeleton and adherens junctions which promotes cortical cytoskeletal remodeling and EC barrier protective effects of oxidized phospholipids.  3. Established a mechanism forphosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate PtdIns(3,4,5)P3generation by scaffolded phosphoinositide kinases. In this pathway, class I phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase(PI(3)K) is assembled by IQGAP1 with PI(4)KIII and PIPKI, which sequentially generate PtdIns(3,4,5)P3from phosphatidylinositol. By scaffolding these kinases into functional proximity, the PtdIns(4,5)P2generated isselectively used by PI(3)K for PtdIns(3,4,5)P3generation, which then signals to PDK1 and Akt that are also in the complex. Moreover, multiple receptor types stimulate the assembly of this IQGAP1-PI(3)K signalling complex. Blockade of IQGAP1 interaction with PIPKI or PI(3)K inhibited PtdIns(3,4,5)P3generation and signalling, and selectively diminished cancer cell survival, revealing a target for cancer chemotherapy.  4. Showed that IQGAP1 associates with both the insulin receptor (IR) and insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1), and influences insulin action. Insulin binds to IR and induces tyrosine phosphorylation of the receptor and IRS-1, leading to activation of the PKB/Akt and MAPK/ERK pathways.In vitroanalysis with pure proteins revealed that the IQ region of IQGAP1 binds directly to the intracellular domain of IR. Similarly, the phosphotyrosine-binding domain of IRS-1 mediates a direct interaction with the C-terminal tail of IQGAP1. Consistent with these observations, both IR and IRS-1 co-immunoprecipitated with IQGAP1 from cells. Investigation of the functional effects of the interactions revealed that in the absence of IQGAP1, insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of Akt and ERK, as well as the association of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase with IRS-1, were significantly decreased. Importantly, loss of IQGAP1 results in impaired insulin signaling and glucose homeostasisin vivo.Collectively, these data reveal that IQGAP1 is a scaffold for IR and IRS-1 and implicate IQGAP1 as a participant in insulin signaling."
"9404365","Project Summary/Abstract: Transgenic & Genetic Constructs (TGC)  The Transgenic & Genetic Constructs (TGC) Shared Resource, directed by Dr. Steven Fiering, provides services  for generating, maintaining, and genetically and experimentally manipulating genetically modified mice (GMM).  TGC provides mouse, cell, and genetic construct manipulation and speed congenics to NCCC researchers.  These technical services are provided by 3 technical specialists, one for the mouse work, one in Embryonic  Stem cell culture and general molecular biology research, and the third performing automated SNP genotyping  assays using Illumina(R) technology. Newer services of TGC involve using techniques to generate mice with  either humanized immune systems or humanized livers. A colony of immunodeficient Nod/SCID/IL2gamma  receptor knockout mice (NSG) is in high demand by NCCC researchers, because they are the optimal strain for  establishing xenografts of human tumor cell lines. For many GMM-based experiments, knowing the genetic  background carrying the genetic modifications is crucial. Traditionally, a 3-year process of random backcrossing  has been required to change the genetic background of a GMM. Dr. James Gorham, with assistance from  Fiering, established a speed congenic facility that uses automated SNP genotyping to perform speed congenic  and related services on GMM. Merging TGC with the Speed Congenics Resource expanded TGC services to  provide rapid identification of male breeders with the highest proportion of the desired background; this has cut  the required number of backcross generations from 10 to 5. On a daily basis, Fiering focuses primarily on the  transgenic mouse generation and utilization services, and Gorham focuses on the speed congenics, but they  work together to direct TGC as one unit. Combining these services into TGC has enabled us to expand and  improve services and efficiency to better serve our clients. The generation and utilization of GMM is a  technically complex field, with new techniques rapidly evolving. TGC constantly is developing new technical  capabilities and new services to broaden our ability to support GMM usage in cancer research. The vast  majority of services provided by TGC utilize equipment (e.g., tissue culture hoods, molecular biology equipment,  microscopes, and injection devices and surgical tools) that have been in the lab for most of the 16 years of its  existence. Biological systems in use at a given time, technological approaches and the faculty and their interests  constantly evolve. Our ability to provide the broad range of services is dependent primarily on the accumulated  skill of the personnel performing the service tasks, such as culturing ES cells, manipulating embryos, using  recombineering to generate constructs, and speed congenic analysis. TGC services are an important component  of the research conducted by 4 of 6 NCCC Research Programs (Cancer Mechanisms, Molecular Therapeutics,  Cancer Imaging & Radiobiology, and Immunology & Cancer Immunotherapy). TGC also has entered into shared  service agreements with the University of Vermont Transgenic Shared Resource and Jackson Labs to avoid  overlapping services and to refer clients for services not available at their institution."
"9390485","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Early Adult Reduction of weight through Lifestyle (EARLY) Consortium includes several randomized controlled intervention trials designed to reduce weight or prevent unhealthy weight gain in young adults. Each of 7 participating sites across the United States developed their own intervention(s) using a variety of behavioral change techniques and including technologies used by young adults. Thus, there is heterogeneity in the interventions across the studies. However, the investigators agreed to common elements across all of the studies such as some common measurements, including outcomes, and aspects of the data collection protocols. This model whereby multiple interventions are funded to test several approaches for a health outcome using a set of common elements has been increasingly used by various institutes within the NIH. This approach has great potential to advance knowledge beyond what could be learned from the individual research studies by combining information across studies in a meaningful way. The EARLY studies have a Resource and Coordination Unit (RCU) that maintains a common database to which all of the studies contribute and which facilitates cross-study analyses. Complex interventions commonly employ various techniques for behavior modification, and it is not always the case that all techniques contribute to intervention success. End results of controlled clinical trials may indicate that an intervention package worked better than a control condition, but little other specificity regarding the theory based techniques that led to intervention success may be available. This application will use an innovative process to identify behavioral techniques across studies that lead to successful weight loss. Specifically, the approach to be implemented is to measure the extent to which behavior change techniques are employed by each of the EARLY interventions and to use those measures in conjunction with measures of intervention intensity in a manner similar to a process previously used successfully by another consortium of independent but coordinated randomized controlled trials. The long-term objective is to identify the theory-based behavior change techniques that lead to successful weight loss in young adults in this group of interventions. Another goal of this project is to develop, test and disseminate the process used to identify the most promising techniques across this consortium of studies. Hence, the goals of this project are to identify basic discoveries about intervention components related to weight loss and to disseminate the information to scientists, physicians, and ultimately the public."

"9535719","Project Summary  The Tumor Biology Program aims to catalyze research within the ACC to advance understanding of the  molecular mechanisms underlying cancer pathogenesis and to translate this knowledge to identify new and  more effective preventive, diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic approaches. This Program, which was  founded in the early 1970s, continues to progressively respond to advances in cancer research. Its overarching  scientific aims are to: 1) Elucidate the molecular and cellular basis of carcinogenesis, and 2) Translate these  findings into durable clinical applications. To that end, the Program is organized around three central goals or  themes: 1) Structural biology of molecules relevant to cancer, 2) The molecular and cellular basis of cancer,  and 3) The use of model organisms to study cancer in vivo. Interactive, intra-Programmatic scientific affinity  groups foster collaboration within and across themes, including: 1) Tthe tumor microenvironment, 2) RNA  biology, 3) DNA repair and genomic stability, 4) Cancer cell metabolism (this spawned a new ACC Basic  Science Center of Excellence), and 5) Organ-specific cancers, such as pancreatic (this has been integrated  into the new ACC Pancreatic Translational Center of Excellence). The Program continues under the strong  leadership of Anil Rustgi, MD, who fosters deep and impactful intra- and inter-Programmatic collaborative  relationships. Program Leadership is also instrumental in recruiting new members (e.g., Drs. Berger, Feldser,  Garcia, and Puré), mentoring junior faculty, establishing scientific affinity groups to leverage and further  develop common research interests among faculty members, and organizing conferences and symposia.  Program members are extremely actively involved in the training and mentorship of PhD students, MD/PhD  students, and MD or PhD postdoctoral fellows by virtue of their leadership roles in the Penn Biomedical  Graduate Studies, MD/PhD (MSTP) program and NIH T32 training grants. Program Leadership was highly  successful in harnessing Institutional support to catalyze a tumor biology translational research initiative and  increased translational research has been pursued in both thematic and organ-specific contexts. Its success is  evident in the emergence of new transdisciplinary, disease-specific collaborations that join Program members  with colleagues in Clinical Research and Population Science to study cancers, such as pancreatic and  esophageal, in which there is an unmet need for improved diagnosis and treatment. Currently, the Program  has 50 members from 16 departments and four different schools with total funding of $22M (annual direct  costs) of which $18.7M is peer-reviewed and $5.6M is NCI-funded. Since 2010, members published 466  cancer-related papers, of which 15% were intra-Programmatic, 32% were inter-Programmatic, and 30% were  multi-institutional."

"9549482","We are evaluating biomarkers in patients with severe infections that lead to shock and lung dysfunction. Samples are being analyzed in collaboration with collaborators at the University of Tennessee Memphis who have conducted a trial prospectively evaluating the effects of corticosteroids on outcome from septic shock or severe respiratory failure. Our goals are to evaluate biomarkers at the time of study entry and during the course of the illness to determine if there are molecules that will help characterize the patients who are likely to have a beneficial response from corticosteroid therapy. During the last year we have screened samples from patients with documented infection and ARDS for chemokines, cytokines, hemostatic, and growth factors that have been suggested to play a role in the pathogenesis of lung injury.    We utilized a highly sensitive antibody profiling technology to study autoantibodies in 48 patients with either acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or severe sepsis. 57% of ARDS and 46% of septic patients without ARDS had elevated autoantibodies compared to the healthy controls. Frequent high titer antibodies were detected against a spectrum of autoantigens including potassium channel regulator, gastric ATPase, glutamic decarboxylase-65 and several cytokines. Analysis of serial samples revealed that titers of low autoantibodies at early time points rose precipitously and peaked between days 7-14. The rapid induction of autoantibodies in ARDS and severe sepsis suggests that ongoing systemic inflammation and associated tissue destruction mediate the break in tolerance against these self-proteins and may contribute to late term sequela of systemic inflammation. (J Transl Med 2010; 8:97)  We studied biomarkers in 79 patients receiving methylprednisolone or usual care during early ARDS. Interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor, vascular endothelial growth factor, protein C, procalcitonin and proadrenomedullin were measured in archived plasma. We found that the changes in biomarkers changes varied with the precipitating cause of ARDS (infectious vs. noninfectious and pulmonary vs. non-pulmonary etiologies), suggesting that the underlying mechanisms and response to anti-inflammatory therapy may vary with the cause of ARDS. (Crit Care Med 2012; 40:495)  We are currently evaluating the differential effects of anti-inflammatory therapy on the expression of microRNA species associated with archived samples of peripheral blood cells from patients with ARDS. These molecules may provide insight into mechanisms that are engaged with the initiation of this therapy for severely ill patients.  Preliminary analysis of this work has been presented (microRNA Expression in Peripheral Blood Cells from Patients with Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome Treated with Corticosteroids.

"9549470","Advances in antiretroviral (ARV) pharmacotherapy have translated to increased longevity and improved quality of life in people living with HIV; hence, elderly individuals comprise an increasing proportion of todays HIV population. Moreover, HIV infection itself has become recognized as a condition characterized by a hypercoaguable state and premature immunologic aging. Potential interactions between ARVs and anticoagulant medications are of particular concern considering that many elderly, and even non-elderly HIV patients will require short-term or chronic anticoagulation to prevent and/or treat systemic embolism. Dabigatran, administered as dabigatran etexilate, is an oral irreversible, competitive direct thrombin inhibitor, which has been shown to be superior to warfarin, and non-inferior to enoxaparin, in preventing thromboembolism in patients with atrial fibrillation and undergoing orthopedic surgery, respectively.   While dabigatran itself is not a substrate of Permeability-glycoprotein (P-gp), its inactive pro-drug, dabigatran etexilate, is a substrate of P-gp. Co-administration of dabigatran etexilate with P-gp modulators has resulted in significant changes in dabigatran exposure. The pharmacokinetic enhancers, ritonavir and cobicistat, as inhibitors of P-gp, are expected to increase plasma concentrations of dabigatran; however, neither agent has been studied in combination with dabigatran etexilate, to date. Hence, the purpose of this study is to determine whether the separate co-administration of ritonavir or cobicistat with dabigatran etexilate increases the systemic exposure of dabigatran in healthy volunteers, and if so, whether adjusting the administration times of these medications can circumvent this interaction.  In this open-label study, 32 healthy volunteers will be assigned to 1 of 2 groups. Group A will consist of 16 subjects who will take 22 days of ritonavir; Group B will consist of 16 subjects who will take 22 days of cobicistat. All subjects will receive 3 separated single doses of dabigatran etexilate. Pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) sampling for dabigatran will occur on Days 0  1, Day 191  20, and Day 261  27. The PD effects of dabigatran will be characterized via ecarin clotting time (ECT) measurements.  Dabigatran PK/PD parameters will be determined using non-compartmental methods with the WinNonlin professional computer program (version 5.2; Pharsight Corporation, Mountain View, CA). The following PK/PD parameters will be compared between the groups: area under the curve from 0 to 24 hours (AUC0-24), maximum total dabigatran plasma concentration (Cmax), area under the curve from 0 to infinity hours (AUC0-), time to maximum plasma concentration (tmax), terminal half-life (T), apparent oral clearance (CL/F), area under the effect curve from 0 to 24 hours (AUEC0-24), and the maximum effect ratio over baseline (ERmax).  This study has completed full enrollment of all subjects in both arms of the study.  Parttial data was presented at 15th International Workshop on Clinical Pharmacology in HIV and Hepatitis, Washington DC, May, 2014 and the 2015 and 2016 Annual Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections in Boston, MA (2015) and Seattle, WA (2016.

"9402105","The arterial microenvironment at atherosclerosis-prone sites primes the endothelium for activation by a variety of systemic atherogenic factors, in part through enhanced endothelial NF-?B expression at sites of disturbed flow. Additionally, disturbed flow patterns are permissive for subendothelial matrix remodeling, and work from my group and others have shown that fibronectin deposition enhances the endothelial proinflammatory response to both disturbed flow and oxidized LDL. Current research into the mechanisms of fibronectin deposition at atheroprone sites focus on altered fibronectin expression. However, our preliminary data show that oxidized LDL elicits robust fibronectin deposition driven by dynamic talin1-dependent integrin activation without altered fibronectin expression, suggesting a novel model for atherogenic matrix remodeling. In the previous grant period, we demonstrated that integrin-specific signaling differentially mediates flow and oxidized LDL induced NF-?B signaling and proinflammatory gene expression, and our published and preliminary data show that inhibiting or deleting endothelial fibronectin-binding integrins reduces early atherogenic inflammation in vivo. Despite the importance of integrin-mediated NF-?B activation in multiple systems, the signaling pathways linking integrins to NF-?B activation remain relatively unknown. The I?B kinase IKK? activates canonical NF-?B signaling, and both flow and oxLDL stimulate IKK?-dependent NF-?B activation. Nonproteolytic ubiquitination (K63-linked and Met1-linked ubiquitin chains) drives the formation of signaling microdomains that classically couple IKK? to its upstream activators through the recruitment of ubiquitin-binding proteins, such as obligatory IKK?-binding partner IKK?. Our preliminary data demonstrate robust K63 ubiquitination in integrin adhesion complexes associated with IKK? targeting, and blunting K63 ubiquitination prevents oxLDL-induced NF-?B activation. In addition, we show that endothelial cells lacking fibronectin-binding integrins display reduced responsiveness to proinflammatory stimuli, suggesting that integrin signaling contributes to endothelial priming associated with the atheroprone phenotype. The research outlined in this proposal will test the hypothesis that dynamic integrin activation in endothelial cells drives fibronectin deposition and integrin-specific signaling to promote endothelial activation. We will accomplish this by examining the mechanisms regulating talin1-dependent integrin activation and fibronectin deposition in vitro and in vivo using the endothelial talin1 L325R transgenic mice deficient for integrin activation (Aim 1). We will delineate the mechanisms regulating integrin-dependent nonproteolytic ubiquitination in IKK?/NF-?B activation and characterize how fibronectin-binding integrins prime the endothelial cells for activation (Aim 2). Lastly, we will utilize inducible endothelial-specific deletion models to determine whether endothelial fibronectin-binding integrins contribute to endothelial priming in vivo, to atherosclerotic plaque progression following early matrix remodeling, and to flow-induced arteriogenic inflammation (Aim 3).  "
"9390405","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): One in 10 American adults, more than 20 million people, has some level of chronic kidney disease (CKD). This problem is especially severe in the elder population. For example, the incidence of recognized CKD in people ages 65 and older more than doubled between 2000 and 2008, and the prevalence in people ages 60 and older is now nearly 25%. At the end of 2009, more than 871,000 people were being treated for end-stage renal disease (ESRD) at an annual cost of $40B in public and private funds. Among the ESRD population, nearly 400,000 were being treated with some form of dialysis. Vascular access is a key component of dialysis systems and complications with both arterio-venous (AV) grafts and fistulas limit long-term survival rates. Frequent thrombosis is well described in prosthetic AV grafts and, to a lesser extent, fistulas. Current declot strategies often use a pharmacomechanical approach with initial thrombolysis and subsequent use of mechanical thrombectomy and/or balloon angioplasty. However, occasionally thrombolysis can be a lengthy and costly procedure with inherent risk. This is particularly the case if infusion thrombolysis is used. We have developed a targetable nanoagent containing nanoemulsion beads (NEB) with gold nanoshperes (GNS) decorating the surface (NEB-GNS) and combined it with a system delivering integrated photo-sono therapy and ultrasound(US)/photacoustic(PA) imaging to produce a tool for molecular theranostics using non-ionizing radiation. We hypothesize that this system can enable rapid, site-localized clot breakage with greatly reduced complications to manage thrombus in AV grafts and fistulas. To test this hypothesis, a research plan with four specific aims has been developed. In Aim 1, we will extend the capabilities of NEB-GNS nanoagents and explore new formulations to optimize both non-linear PA imaging and photo-sono activated therapies. Aim 2 will focus on PA imaging using non-linear processing to enhance both the sensitivity and specificity of molecular imaging with NEB-GNS nanoagents. Therapeutic methods based on site-localized cavitation using simultaneous photo/sono activation will be optimized in Aim 3 with a wide range of studies identifying optimal laser and US parameters for highly controlled cavitation. These studies will be validated on an in vitro clot model. Finally, in Aim 4 the overall approach to non-invasive molecular theranostics using NEB-GNS will be tested in vivo using a well-defined porcine model of vascular clotting."
"9390991","Despite tremendous progress in our understanding of the primary sensory neurons and spinal cord interneuronal circuits that respond to and transmit pain and itch-provoking stimuli, how these stimuli are interpreted by the brain to produce the perceptions of pain and itch are still unclear. To a great extent, this gap in our knowledge reflects the much more limited information that we have about the projection neurons that carry the information from the spinal cord to the brain. That gap is critical as it is the signals carried by the projection neurons that are ?read? by the brain and that ultimately lead to a perception of pain or itch, and to their various submodalities (heat, cold, mechanical, etc.). Our research program is multidisciplinary, using novel viral, genetic and functional (electrophysiological, behavioral and imaging) approaches to characterize the properties of the projection neurons, the circuits that engage them, their supraspinal targets and the functional consequence of their activity. An important focus of the research program is on the question of convergence or segregation of the circuits that respond to painful or itch-provoking stimuli and the extent to which these circuits are altered in the setting of injury. Our program includes several highly innovative experiments that for the first time will not only determine the molecular heterogeneity of the projection neurons, but will also examine the responses of populations of neurons in the brain to activity in the projection neurons. Defining molecular subtypes of projection neurons and the development of Cre-expressing mice based on these molecular features will permit a host of experiments, including viral-based retrograde (rabies) and anterograde (HSV) tracing of circuits that influence subsets of projection neurons, as well as the behavioral consequence of selective ablation, or DREADD-mediated activation/inhibition of these neurons. Finally, using incredibly powerful Ca2+ imaging techniques that signal the activity of populations of neurons in awake, freely moving mice, we will obtain new information on the behavioral correlates of algogen and pruritogen-evoked supraspinal activity. Using novel behavioral paradigms our program will also provide important insights into the processes through which noxious, and even innocuous stimuli (in the setting of injury), are interpreted as painful. These new approaches will provide information about the quality of the pain that the animal experiences and also offer a powerful validation of the mouse models of chronic pain and itch and their translatability to the human condition.  "
"9405903","Project Summary Following loss of ~58% of lung units by right pneumonectomy (PNX) in adult canines, supra-threshold tissue and microvascular mechanical stress additively stimulate compensatory lung growth and remodeling (CLGR) of remaining lung units, leading to regeneration of alveolar tissue-capillaries and restoring ~50% of the lost function. This robust model of regeneration mimics the consequences of destructive lung disease, allowing exploration of adaptive mechanisms in the remaining functioning lung units capable of responding, irrespective of the specific pathology causing destruction. CLGR is plastic; supplementation of growth promoters, e.g., retinoic acid or erythropoietin (Epo), further enhances alveolar tissue-capillary formation in remaining lobes but has not further augmented lung function, indicating a structure-function discrepancy in response to exogenous stimulation. This may be because mechanically induced lung growth also increases oxidative stress, which in turn limits growth and remodeling; also newly added tissue-capillaries may distort architecture of the acinus, the fundamental unit of gas exchange, and detract from functional enhancement. Anti-oxidation may be a key factor in resolving the structure-function discrepancy. Oxidative stress, paracrine Epo signaling via its receptor (EpoR), and the circulating anti-oxidative factor ?Klotho, are all persistently elevated during post-PNX CLGR. ?Klotho acts upstream of EpoR to enhance EpoR cytoprotection in vitro, suggesting that ?Klotho may also enhance angiogenic stimulation via the Epo-EpoR axis. We propose that optimal CLGR requires a balance between mechanical signals and cytoprotection, and concurrent ?Klotho anti-oxidation may enhance EpoR-stimulated angiogenesis in CLGR. Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that ?Klotho and EpoR mutually enhance each other to relieve oxidative stress in the lung, using mice with lung-specific conditional EpoR deletion ± genetic Klotho insufficiency, exposed to oxidant challenge. Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that ?Klotho augments EpoR-mediated angiogenic stimulation and acinar remodeling in CLGR to facilitate translation of structural growth into functional gain. We will concurrently deliver nanoparticles containing EpoR and/or ?Klotho cDNA to post-PNX young and adult canine lungs, to assess alveolar-capillary regrowth (in vivo CT and electron microscopy), angiogenic factor and progenitor cell distribution, stratified acinar architecture (microCT) and functional compensation. Finally, we will develop and compare (?Klotho+EpoR) cDNA treatment in PNX model with a canine unilateral elastase emphysema model characterized by reduced mechanical stress and elevated inflammatory oxidative stress. These issues of stratified acinar remodeling, growth-stimulation vs. cytoprotection balance, and overcoming structure-function discrepancy in CLGR, have not been examined; they directly impact any intervention aimed at promoting repair and regeneration of the native functioning lung units in destructive lung disease, e.g., emphysema or fibrosis as well as in transplanted or bioengineered lungs."
"9510498","Project Summary To eliminate virally infected cells, cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) must recognize viral antigens that are properly displayed on the cell surface by a molecule called MHC class I. To escape the CTL-mediated killing, viruses have evolved a variety of mechanisms to dampen the antigen presenting functions of MHC class I. Interestingly, although the structure of the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) is very similar to the MHC class I, FcRn is unable to present antigens to T cells. In contrast, FcRn is capable of transporting IgG across epithelial cells and protecting IgG from degradation. In this way, FcRn ensures an effective and long-lasting antibody-mediated immunity after infection and vaccination. Given that FcRn and MHC class I molecules share a very closely similar structure, we hypothesize viruses must possess mechanisms to interfere with FcRn structure and function, consequently inhibiting important IgG functions during infection. By using a model pathogen human cytomegalovirus, we seek to fully investigate this possibility. Therefore, this study will potentially discover a novel immune evasion mechanism by hindering FcRn function. Consequently, this study will significantly improve our knowledge for the rational design of novel strategies for HCMV vaccine development and antibody-mediated passive immunization and immune therapy."
"9357384","7. Project Summary/Abstract My research is rooted in a developmental psychopathology framework and focuses on understanding mechanisms that influence the development and persistence of aggression in youth, with the long-term goal of translating this knowledge to develop more effective prevention and intervention efforts. The prevalence of aggression among clinically referred youth and the well-documented associated risks speaks to the urgent need for research to identify child and familial risk mechanisms to better determine who is most vulnerable and how to best intervene with those youth and their families. The current proposal seeks to examine emotional reactivity as a neurobiological vulnerability for the persistence of reactive aggression (RA) during the critical transition to adolescence, a time period marked by substantial changes in the neurobiology underlying emotional development. Additionally, it aims to assess how dynamic parent-child transactions may serve to exacerbate RA over time, as parenting may be particularly potent for at-risk youth during this developmentally sensitive period. This application details a comprehensive training plan that allows me to address these questions and build on my previous experiences in several important ways. First, in light of the heterogeneity among youth engaging in aggressive behaviors, I aim to examine mechanisms underlying a more specific behavioral phenotype of aggression, namely RA, during the transition to adolescence, a time of rapid neurobiological change. Second, I seek to expand my knowledge of neurobiological assessment modalities to psychophysiological assessment of mechanisms underlying RA. Third, I hope to master the processing and analysis of ecological momentary assessments as an innovative tool to comprehensively assess RA and its underlying mechanisms in daily life. Concordant with NIMH strategic priorities 2.1 and 2.2, the current proposal takes a transactional approach and focuses on within-individual differences by utilizing a multi-modal, ecologically informed assessment of RA, emotional reactivity and parenting during the transition to adolescence. Independent and interactive effects of individual variation in emotional reactivity and parenting dimensions on the development and persistence of RA over 18 months will be tested in a clinically at-risk sample of youth. The aims of the study are 1) investigate concurrent and prospective associations between individual variation in emotional reactivity and RA during the transition to adolescence; 2) examine the bi- directional nature of parental response to emotional reactivity and RA over 18 months; 3) assess parental response to emotional reactivity as a moderator of the association between emotional reactivity and RA. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that heightened emotional reactivity as measured multidimensionally confers risk for the persistence of RA into adolescence, with variation in parental response to emotional reactivity and RA serving to exacerbate or ameliorate this association. This knowledge can ultimately be used to further develop prevention and intervention targets for these specific processes."
"9343057","Project Summary/Abstract This is a first R01 application from an early stage, new investigator and current NIEHS K01 awardee. Parkinson disease (PD) is a disabling neurodegenerative disease for which there is no cure. Years before the diagnosis of PD and the onset of motor symptoms, PD patients develop non-motor symptoms, including, importantly, constipation and gastrointestinal dysfunction. Constipation affects over 80% of PD patients and is one of the strongest risk factors for PD. Recent research shows that the enteric nervous system in the gut and the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus nerve which anatomically links the GI system to the brain, are among the first and most severely affected by alpha-synuclein pathology characteristic of PD5 leading to the hypothesis that the gastrointestinal tract might be the site of initiation of PD. We propose to conduct a comprehensive investigation of the relation between human gut microbiome and PD, focusing on the pre- onset microbiome. We will do this by building on an ongoing Department of Defense funded project that has identified participants with pre-parkinson syndrome (PPS - defined as the co- occurrence of constipation, pRBD (probable rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder) and hyposmia) that in a pilot study has been associated with a ~200 fold increase in PD risk. Studying the microbiome among this group, who are highly likely to develop PD or are already in the premotor state, will give us a unique look at the microbiome in PD patients prior to any potential disease-associated effects of changes in diet and lifestyle that may have confounded prior case-control studies. The proposed study will take advantage of 25 years of prospectively collected data on environmental and dietary exposures and disease outcomes in two prospective cohorts of men and women."
"9389367","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Interstitial lung disease (ILD) is a complex and heterogeneous disorder that is often associated with autoimmune syndromes; however, despite the connection between ILD and autoimmunity, studies have yet to identify a pathogenic mechanism whereby an autoimmune response specifically targets the lung within ILD patients. With our discovery of novel mouse and human lung antigens (BPIFB1) targeted in autoimmune- mediated ILD, we have linked an autoimmune response to the lung-specific protein BPIFB1 and clinical ILD. Our studies in the Aire translational model have demonstrated a critical role for lun autoantigens in ILD pathogenesis. Patients with defects in the AIRE gene develop the human Autoimmune Polyglandular Syndrome Type 1 (APS1), which includes lung autoimmunity, due to a well-defined breakdown in immune tolerance. Importantly, lung autoimmunity in this model shows relevance to more common forms of autoimmune-associated ILD, as patients and mice with defects in Aire develop autoimmune ILD that is pathologically identical to the ILD of autoimmune connective tissue disorders such as in RA. Strikingly, a subset of non-APS1 patients with autoimmune ILD harbor autoantibodies to BPIFB1, the major human antigen we identified in our model. These results strongly suggest that the Aire model represents a novel ideal system for studying the role of lung-specific autoimmunity in ILD pathogenesis. We hypothesize that autoreactive T cell responses targeting self-antigens in the lung are an important mechanism for inciting interstitial lung inflammation and fibrosis in autoimmune disease. We aim to develop improved insights into disease mechanisms to allow targeted cytokine or cellular interventions in preventing lung autoimmunity and lung fibrosis. To this end we will: (1) define the role of BPIFB1 as a major lung autoantigen in lung autoimmunity; (2) define the role of TH17 cells in autoimmune lung fibrosis; and (3) develop tools for improved diagnosis and disease monitoring in ILD patients. With completion of the proposed studies, we will be poised to gain significant insight into the relevant antigenic targets and effector mechanisms of autoimmune-mediated ILD. By demonstrating that loss of self-tolerance to lung-specific antigens contributes to ILD in a subset of patients with known or unrecognized autoimmunity, we will establish the role of these mechanisms in autoimmune lung injury and progression to lung fibrosis. With development of sensitive and antigen-specific assays, we hope to more accurately diagnosis autoimmune-associated ILD at earlier stages, allowing at risk patients to be monitored or undergo more specific immune-targeted interventions to alter the devastating course of ILD and resultant lung fibrosis."
"9572256","Goals and Objectives: The NIH Center for Interventional Oncology is an interdisciplinary effort with the primary goal of establishing an environment that will bring together multidisciplinary partners who will help define this emerging field of interventional oncology for minimally-invasive image-guided methods for treatment of locally-dominant cancer. A separate report is filed within the NIH Clinical Center (CC), since this multidisciplinary effort is supported by both NCI and CC.  Project Summary: The NIH Center for Interventional Oncology is an interdisciplinary effort with the primary goal of developing and better defining novel local, regional, or combination cancer therapies in patients with localized or organ-confined neoplasms. The goals are achieved via collaborations between imaging scientists, interventional radiologists, oncologists (surgical, medical, radiation, or urological), biologists, chemists, and engineers. The CIO provides a translational environment wherein clinical shortcomings in oncology are identified, then addressed by a collaborative team that develop novel technologies and techniques. Minimally invasive therapies are often less costly, safer, and easy to translate and broadly apply in the setting of the NIH Clinical Center and Intramural Research Program. The Center for Interventional Oncology (CIO) was established in late FY 09 at the NIH Clinical Center (CC) to develop and translate image-guided technologies for localized cancer treatments. The Center is a collaboration involving the CC and the National Cancer Institute (NCI), and to lesser extent NIBIB. The Center draws on the strengths of each partner to investigate how imaging technologies and devices can diagnose and treat localized cancers in ways that are precisely targeted and minimally or non-invasive. It will also help bridge the gap between diagnosis and therapy, and between emerging technology and procedural medicine. Advanced imaging methods have ushered in an era of earlier detection of cancers that are frequently localized to a single organ or region. Interventional oncology often provides cancer patients with local or regional treatment options to augment the standard systemic treatment options like: chemotherapy, surgery, and radiation. CIO investigators will leverage the interdisciplinary, translational environment at the CC to investigate and optimize how and when to combine drugs, devices, and multimodal imaging navigation. For example, activatable drugs can be injected in a vein or artery, then deployed directly in the tumor with needles or catheters using medical GPS, a technique that enables the physician to navigate through the body with real-time visualization using the latest advanced imaging technologies, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET), computed tomography (CT), cone beam CT (CBCT), or ultrasound. Pre-procedural images are reused to guide devices delivering targeted therapy to the location of the disease, making the procedure more cost-effective because it doesn't require the MRI, CT or PET system used to record the image to be physically present. A prior prostate MRI, for example, can be used to help with guided biopsy or focal ablation by using a medical GPS-enabled needle and ultrasound, without requiring, occupying or tying up an MRI system during the procedure. In another example, a thin needle or sound waves can be used to ablate tumors and enhance targeted drug delivery. Energy sources include high-intensity focused ultrasound, freezing, microwaves, laser, and radiofrequency. Researchers also expand investigations into image-guided drug delivery or image-guided drug painting, where the image can be used to prescribe a particular drug to a specific region, by combining targeted, activate-able drugs with localized energy or heat to deploy the drug within specially engineered nano-particles. The Center provides a forum to encourage collaborations among researchers and patient-care experts in medical, surgical, urologic, and radiation oncology and interventional radiology. The CC provides an exceptional environment for this type of collaborative translational research and patient care. Other major program components include the development of new image-guided methods for personalized drug investigations (or tracking tissue responses to investigational drugs during drug discovery) and first-in-human investigations involving new drugs, devices, image-guided robotic assistance, and nanoparticles. Targeted sequential biopsy is a powerful tool for drug discover or biomarker characterization. Education and cross-training is another important part of the program. Significant gaps exist between the various disciplines, between research efforts and patient care, and between diagnosis and treatment. The gaps may be integrated through advanced image methods for localized therapy. Further, cross-disciplinary training programs in interventional oncology suited to these early disease detect & treat paradigms do not yet exist, but would augment existing programs and underline the unique translational atmosphere at the NIH, where bench-to-bedside is the rule. Specific aims include: 1. Develop training and education in Interventional Oncology 2. Develop novel image-guided methods for smart biopsy and biomarker procurement to support targeted therapeutics 3. Support patient care using novel minimally invasive Interventional Oncology techniques 4. Pursue research in novel techniques and technologies in Interventional Oncology. This program is ideally and uniquely positioned to provide an interdisciplinary environment that combines training, patient care, and translational research to accelerate progress in interventional oncology and molecularly targeted interventions. The focus is upon translational models, translational tools, and actual practical deliverables of translation of multidisciplinary paradigms that meet specific clinical needs."
"9434282","PROJECT SUMMARY ! UHRF1 (ubiquitin-like, PHD and RING finger containing 1) is a multi-domain E3 ubiquitin ligase overexpressed in many human cancers. Deregulation of UHRF1 has been shown to correlate with cell proliferation and metastasis, and loss of UHRF1 renders cancer cells hypersensitive to DNA damaging agents. Genetic studies determined that UHRF1 is required for the epigenetic inheritance of DNA methylation, and that recognition of methylated histone H3 lysine 9 by the UHRF1 tandem Tudor domain (TTD) and adjacent plant homeodomain (PHD) is necessary to maintain DNA methylation patterns in human cancer cells. UHRF1 also contains a SET and Ring-associated domain (SRA) that binds hemi-methylated DNA, suggesting UHRF1 may recruit DNMT1 to replicating chromatin. Collectively, these data demonstrate that UHRF1 plays a fundamental role in the DNA methylation program through multivalent engagement of epigenetic modifications on the chromatin template. Because DNA methylation and histone PTMs are not coded for in the DNA sequence, vary among cell types, and are mediated in a large part by ?druggable? effector proteins, targeted intervention of proteins that recognize and interpret these epigenetic modifications represents a novel and promising cancer therapeutic strategy. We hypothesize that chemical disruption of the binding interaction between UHRF1 and chromatin is a rationale therapeutic approach to modulate cellular DNA methylation in human cancers. The goal of this proposal is therefore is to discover potent, selective, cell-active antagonists of the histone and DNA binding domains of UHRF1. These studies will set a strong foundation for subsequent drug discovery platforms targeting complex epigenetic readers and will facilitate the future study of UHRF1 function in normal biology, as well as developmental and disease states."
"9431890","PROJECT SUMMARY:  Airway inflammatory diseases such as asthma are characterized by inflammation, airway remodeling and hyperresponsiveness resulting in severe bronchoconstriction. Agonists of the beta adrenergic receptor (??AR) relax airway smooth muscle (ASM), bronchodilate, and hence are prominent asthma prophylaxis and rescue medicines. Recent studies have demonstrated multiple clinical problems associated with ??AR agonists including worsening of asthma symptoms, tachyphylaxis and asthma-associated mortality. Therefore, there is a clinical need to develop novel and improved ?2AR ligands. ?2ARs on ASM are coupled to Gs protein and relax ASM via a cAMP/protein kinase A mechanism. However, recent studies have demonstrated that ?2ARs bind to and activate additional signaling proteins (e.g. ?-arrestins) in target cells leading to untoward functional effects such as desensitization, proliferation, and altered gene expression. Molecular characterization of these regulatory events in airway cells is necessary for ?2AR. Receptor interaction with signaling proteins and thus activation is dependent on the receptor conformation which is based on the chemical structure of the ligand. Indeed, preliminary data suggest that agonist-induced conformational changes in ?2AR is distinct depending upon the structure of the ligand and the presence of interacting proteins such as Gs protein. Therefore, we hypothesize that the activation of multiple signaling pathways is dependent on the conformational heterogeneity of the ?2AR, which can be manipulated by ligands of differing chemical structures. In Aim 1 we will employ advanced computational approaches including atomistic molecular dynamics simulations carried out at a superior spatial and temporal resolution in the presence of interacting proteins and ligands. Further, we will develop functional group affinity patterns, FragMaps, for different conformations of the receptor which will be used to screen for novel ligands. Select compounds will be tested for biological activity in Aim 2 using multiple experimental models including HEK293 cells expressing human ?2AR, human ASM cells, isolated airways and lung slices, and by determining intracellular signaling (cAMP generation, PKA activation, ERK phosphorylation) and functional effects (relaxation, proliferation). We will correlate the structural information obtained from Aim 1 with the signaling and functional findings from Aim 2 to identify novel ?2AR agonists. We anticipate that the ?2AR ligands will act in a biased fashion, differentially favoring certain G-protein dependent, or, ?-arrestin dependent processes, based on ligand structure and the receptor conformation established by that ligand. This information can be leveraged for the rational design of novel and improved bronchodilators for asthma."
"9466479","Abstract Teaching is a highly stressful profession and toddler teachers report substantially higher stress levels than teachers of older children, resulting in teacher turnover rates 4 times higher than those of elementary staff and jeopardizing their abilities to foster children?s early development. Early Head Start (EHS) teachers, serving more than more than 160,000 at-risk infants and toddlers annually, may be at the greatest risk for stress. As many as 25% of Head Start staff have significant prior trauma exposure. In our pilot with EHS teachers, 31% reported 4 or more traumatic events. Prior exposure to trauma is robustly associated with greater vulnerability to mental health problems in adulthood, including stress. Hence, there is a great need to better understand teachers? stress, including coping and sources of stress that may account for variability in stress and associations between trauma exposure and stress. Existing research has only examined stress for short periods of time or via general surveys, limiting understanding of teachers? real-time stress over the school year. We propose to use an innovative ecological momentary assessment approach to examine stress (intensity of stress) and coping (mindfulness and social support) in 100 EHS toddler teachers using an existing sample. We are currently funded to implement and evaluate a 13-week professional development (PD) intervention (Hearts and Minds on Babies; HMB). Leveraging the HMB study, this R21 will describe the stress trajectory of toddler teachers by extending stress monitoring of teachers to include brief bi-weekly assessments over the school year. We will also examine coping and sources of stress that account for expected variability in stress. We will assess teachers? prior trauma exposure and its associations with baseline stress and stress trajectories. We also have a unique opportunity to examine differences in teacher stress by HMB intervention group assignment. Aims:(1) Describe the stress trajectory for toddler teachers and test sources of stress and coping as accounting for variability in stress; (2) Examine the effect of prior exposure to trauma on the initial stress level; (3) Identify differences in stress for toddler teachers by PD intervention condition. Approach: We will collect 2X weekly data over the school year (totaling 40 weeks Sept. to June; 80 measurement occasions) on coping and stress (via a smartphone app). Trauma exposure (Aim 2) and intervention group status (Aim 3) data will be provided from the HMB study. Scientific Premise: Chronic stress places heavy demands on teachers? abilities to cope, and jeopardizes their abilities to engage in high quality practices that support children?s development. In order to develop effective PD, there is a great need to better understand teachers? stress, including sources of stress and coping that may account for variability in stress, and the ways in which trauma exposure relates to stress. Impact: Results will elucidate real-time stress in toddler teachers, identify characteristics accounting for variability in stress, and show how PD intervention may impact stress. Findings will inform PD efforts for teachers serving our youngest and most vulnerable children."
"9518123","ABSTRACT Neurodevelopmental disorders such as Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) are a major source of disability and loss of potential, as well as emotional and financial hardship. Primary prevention of these disorders is of great public health importance, calling for the identification of modifiable risk factors, such as environmental chemical exposures. ASD and ADHD are both heritable but there is growing evidence that environment plays a role, and that environmental impact may be influenced by genetics. Traffic-related air pollutants, including fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) have biological evidence of neurotoxicity and human evidence that they may be risk factors for ASD and ADHD. Only two prior studies have considered the influence of genetics on air pollutant risk in neurodevelopmental disorders ? each addressing a single gene ? despite the fact that gene*environment investigation can improve ability to detect the impact of environmental chemicals and add pathophysiological insights. Prior studies are also limited in failing to consider co-diagnosis of ASD and ADHD, which is common, and other sub-phenotypes that may better reflect etiologically homogenous groups impacted by air pollutant exposure. The objective of this application is to conduct the largest single study of air pollutants with ASD and ADHD to date, in the context of genetic variation. The central hypotheses are that higher exposure during critical developmental windows to PM2.5 and NO2 will be associated with ASD and ADHD, the associations will be influenced by genetic factors, and will vary according to neurodevelopmental sub- phenotype. Our aims are: SA1: Deepen the mechanistic understanding of air pollutant risk on ASD, SA2: Clarify a potential role of air pollutant risk in ADHD, and SA3: Investigate the specificity of neurodevelopmental phenotypic subgroup associations with air pollutants, leading to cross-disorder insights. For each aim, we will (A) estimate air pollutant main effects, (B) account for child and family genetic modification of air pollution effects using a multi-faceted targeted approach among hundreds of loci, including genes related to exposure biology and neurodevelopment, and (C) estimate these associations in an exploratory genome-wide agnostic analysis using all available genetic markers. We will use a large, population-based study in Denmark with existing genome-wide genotyping data ? iPSYCH, including 16,146 children with ASD, 18,726 with ADHD (3033 with both), and 28,768 controls. We will add innovative well- validated weekly estimates of PM2.5 and NO2 air pollution exposures during critical developmental periods at both residential and employment locations. This work introduces key innovations including incorporation of novel genetic markers in exposure risk assessment and considering neurodevelopmental sub-phenotypes. It is significant in addressing modifiable causes of developmental disabilities, leading to elucidation of pathogenic mechanisms and specificity of effects, accelerating discovery for prevention and treatment."

"9397165","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Vascular occlusive disease poses an increasing burden on healthcare systems. Blockage of major arteries causes severe ischemic damage to tissues, with the potential of limb loss, organ dysfunction, and death. As a response to occlusion, however, collateral vessels are able to remodel to bypass the occlusion, a process termed arteriogenesis. Accumulating evidence implicates myeloid cells as key mediators of this remodeling, however the exact role these cells play in arteriogenesis remains unclear. Previous studies from our group have identified KLF2 as a transcriptional regulator of myeloid cell activation, a process critical for effective arteriogenesis. Nascent observations in our lab demonstrate that loss of KLF2 in the myeloid compartment greatly enhances perfusion recovery following a model of hindlimb ischemia (HLI). In addition, these differences appear to be greatly dependent on induction of the prominent inflammatory enzyme, inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS). Modification of critical proteins in vascular cells by S-nitrosylation has been shown to greatly affect functions crucial to vascular remodeling. These findings provide the basis for our central hypothesis that KLF2 serves as a regulator of macrophage-mediated nitric oxide (NO) production that affects the S-nitrosoproteome of endothelial and smooth muscle cells during occlusive injury. The proposed study will vigorously interrogate the effects of myeloid-KLF2 on vascular remodeling. Specifically, we aim to examine whether KLF2 serves as a nodal regulator of myeloid function during arteriogenesis, in part through its regulation of NO production. To accomplish this goal, this study will utilize a wide range of biochemical, molecular, and pharmacological techniques, including, but not limited to: in vivo models of arteriogenesis, microCT imaging, pharmacological modulation of NO, and S-nitrosylation assays. Together, these studies will provide crucial insight on the cellular and molecular processes leading to proper arteriogenesis and will provide the foundation for interventions targeting vascular occlusion with the goal of reducing debilitating complications for patients."
"9566613","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) including polycythemia vera (PV), essential thrombocythemia (ET), and primary myelofibrosis (PMF) are a group of chronic hematologic malignancies characterized by the overproduction of myeloid lineage cells. The JAK2V617F mutation has been found in ~95% cases of PV and 50-60% cases of ET and PMF However, the contribution of JAK2V617F in these three different MPNs still remains unclear. Using an inducible JAK2V617F knock-in mouse, we have shown that expression of heterozygous JAK2V617F in hematopoietic compartments is sufficient to cause a PV-like disease whereas homozygous JAK2V617F expression accelerates the progression to myelofibrosis (MF). We also have shown that only JAK2V617F-expressing hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) have the capacity to self-renew and propagate the MPN disease. However, the actual role of JAK2V617F in HSCs has remained unclear and controversial. Most studies are focused on the bone marrow (BM) HSC function. The contribution of spleen HSCs in the maintenance of JAK2V617F-evoked MPN remains unknown. We have found that the number of HSCs in the BM is reduced over time while spleen HSC pool is consistently increased in JAK2V617F knock-in mice. We hypothesize that JAK2V617F expression may cause aberrant HSC function, and JAK2V617F-expressing spleen HSCs may play an important role in the long-term maintenance of MPNs. JAK2 inhibitor therapy exhibits some benefits to the MPN patients but results in significant hematopoietic toxicities since JAK2 is critical for normal hematopoietic development. Identification of the targets of JAK2V617F in HSCs that are required for MPN but are not essential for normal hematopoietic development would facilitate the development of new targeted and safer therapies for MPNs. In preliminary studies, using microarray gene expression profiling, we have identified several targets of JAK2V617F in HSCs. Therefore, Aim 1 will determine the effects of JAK2V617F on BM and spleen HSCs, and identify the downstream targets of JAK2V617F in HSCs that are required for MPN. Although JAK2V617F is the most common mutation found in MF, the mechanisms of MF induced by JAK2V617F remains unknown. We have found that Shp2 is constitutively phosphorylated in JAK2V617F- positive MPN/leukemia patient derived cell lines and in the BM of JAK2V617F knock-in mice. In preliminary studies, we have found that deletion of Shp2 inhibits PV and prevents the development of MF in JAK2V617F mice. We hypothesize that Shp2 may play an important role in the pathogenesis of PV and MF induced by JAK2V617F. Therefore, Aim 2 will define the role of Shp2 in PV and MF induced by JAK2V617F. Inactivating EZH2 mutations have been found in patients with MF. Moreover, a significant proportion of EZH2 mutated MF patients harbor the JAK2V617F mutation. We hypothesize that EZH2 deficiency may contribute to the phenotypic diversity in JAK2V617F-positive MPNs. In Aim 3, we will determine the contribution of EZH2 deficiency in JAK2V617F-evoked MPN. Collectively, these studies will provide important new insights into the molecular pathogenesis of MPNs and may identify new therapeutic targets for treatment of MPNs."
"9468793","Project Summary The drug therapies against the central nervous system (CNS) disorders, such as brain cancer, stroke and Alzheimer's disease, are very limited because of the challenges associated with delivering drugs across the blood-brain barrier (BBB) into the brain. There is a need to develop novel strategies to enhance the delivery of CNS drugs. We have identified a peptide, called the CL peptide, that demonstrates an ability to deliver a small-molecule cargo across a model endothelial barrier. However, little is known about the biophysical properties of this peptide that give it the barrier-penetrating property. In this project, we propose to investigate the biophysical parameters for the peptide-based barrier penetration by working at the intersection of peptide engineering, membrane biophysics, in vitro BBB model development, and microfluidic device design. In Aim 1, we propose to investigate the sequence and secondary structure requirements for the high transcellular transport with the long-term goal of developing design rules for the barrier-penetrating peptides. We will synthesize variants of the CL peptide to test the effect of peptide's charge, hydrophobicity, and amphipathicity on transcellular transport rate. In Aim 2, we propose to use a microfluidic device and confocal microscopy to measure the individual rates of the peptide variants' entry and exit out of cells. We will test the hypothesis that the barrier-penetrating properties are associated with higher exit rates, when compared to other peptides with low transcellular transport rates."

"9549464","Most knowledge of the effects of prenatal exposure to ionizing radiation (IR) is based on atomic bomb survivors and animal studies data. We are examining what effects CT exposure may have on the human embryo using hESC in culture for studying the effects of IR on the hESC cellular radiobiology.  hESC have been proposed for therapy in replacing damaged cells in organs such as the brain and heart in patients who, through various disease processes, sustained the loss of vital differentiated cells. Numerous trials of stem cell therapy using hESC, or induced pluripotent stem cells, are underway. Yet, no one fully understands the effects of even diagnostic CT ionizing radiation exposure on these cells after they have been delivered in vivo for therapies of such patients. Thus, we examined hESC irradiated in situ in a tissue-equivalent, organ-torso, phantom using a commercial CT, at the diagnostic test settings routinely in use. We asked if such exposures induced cell responses such as changed growth, gene expression, or possibly induced mutations in the genomes.  Finally, radiation safety concepts have been generally based upon the assumption that all of us, regardless of our unique genomes, are equally susceptible to the deterministic and stochastic effects of ionizing radiation, even at low doses. However, we today know about multiple genetic mutations, such as the BRCA-1 and BRCA-2 mutations, which affect DNA repair processes to the extent that a percentage of individuals with these genetic changes have an increased risk of developing certain cancers. When an individual has DNA repair deficiency, it stands to reason that exposure to any DNA-damaging levels of ionizing radiation is likely to be more detrimental than to an individual without such a deficiency. By using the multiple hESC lines available to us in the NIH, each genetically distinct, we began to examine differences between the various hESC lines responses to relevant, low-dose, ionizing radiation exposures.  Using the increase in the hESC colony area as a surrogate measurement for cell proliferation, we assessed the effect of IR on seven genetically distinct lines of hESCs. The immediate effect of hESC exposure to IR is some cell death by apoptosis. After an initial drop in the cell population, all lines show recovery of their growth after 24 to 48 hours. We found that relative cell survival (RCS) varied for hESC lines. The RCS of the most radiation sensitive H7 cell line was ca. 1.5 times less than that of the least sensitive WA24 cells. Interestingly, we found strong direct correlation between RCS and cell population doubling times; meaning that faster growing hESC are more prone to selective apoptotic cell death after exposure to IR than slower growing cell lines. One possible explanation of this observation may be that the faster growing cell lines have a higher percentage of cells in S phase. That could reflect a higher sensitivity to IR of cells in S phase. Perhaps they cannot effectively repair their damaged DNA during replication, and thus more cells die from apoptosis.  Thus far, results of our genomic mutation study of hESC suggest that exposure to a modest dose of IR (0.2Gy) did not result in any detectable increase in genetic alterations occurring within multiple cancer hotspot regions of the genome in four hESC lines. Nonetheless, a higher dose of IR (1Gy), which led to much more cell death within 24 hours after exposure, resulted in one detectable gene sequence variation in one of the four hESC lines tested. We believe that our first results support the need for further studies of genetic alterations in human cells caused by IR using next generation sequencing. It should be possible for us to sequence increasingly larger portions of the hESCs genomes with progressively deeper coverage. We plan to extend this particular work to whole-genome sequencing."
"9469257","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Candida albicans is the leading pathogenic fungus of humans as well as a ubiquitous constituent of the microbiome, occupying the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, in addition to the skin, oral cavity and the genitourinary tract. Commensal yeast may transition to an infectious organism in susceptible patients, manifesting in skin and soft tissue cellulitis, oropharyngeal/esophageal candidiasis and septicemia. Antibiotic-driven microbial dysbiosis, immunocompromised HIV and diabetic individuals, and those receiving surgery or indwelling devices are particularly at risk for acquiring candidiasis, resulting in significant clinical complications for which antifungal treatment is the first line of defense. In addition to diverse engagement of the host, C. albicans exhibits a remarkable morphologic plasticity in response to environmental cues, adopting six distinct yeast-like cell shapes with specific transcriptional responses. These observations suggest that this fungus is particularly well adapted to thrive in multiple host environmental niches and potentially evade antifungal treatment in part by utilizing cell type changes. The specific environments in which morphologic plasticity allows for fungal establishment, however remain largely unknown. Additionally, while many studies have documented the ability of white-phase yeast to incite disease, a paucity of data exists defining specific fungal effectors mediating fitness in the host. The long-term goal of this project is to understand the mechanisms by which C. albicans succeeds as a commensal and pathogen in an array of host environments. To uncover the molecular underpinnings of these complex fungal-host interactions, established mouse models that mimic human colonization and disease states will be utilized in two aims. Aim 1 will be directed at understanding the role of colony morphology in C. albicans niche establishment with the host. The six yeast-like cell types will be used in 5 distinct infection models: gastrointestinal and skin commensalism, skin cellulitis, oropharyngeal/espophogeal candidiasis and systemic disease. Mice will be analyzed for fungal burden and cytokine response profile within host tissues in addition to visualization of cell morphology maintenance at the host-fungal interface through scanning electron microscopy and histological imaging. These studies will provide comparative and comprehensive understanding of fungal morphotypes specialized for host niches. In Aim 2, high-throughput forward genetic screens will be performed by infecting this skin of mice in both commensal and cellulitis models with pools of barcoded mutants from a comprehensive C. albicans deletion library. Challenge with yeast in both skin models will reveal previously undescribed genetic regulators and effectors contributing to fitness in both colonization and pathogenesis. In aggregate these innovative research strategies will garner a greater knowledge of the mechanisms of fungal infection and provide new avenues for the evaluation and treatment of candidiasis."
"9549442","Acute cardiac allograft rejection and infection remain significant sources of morbidity and mortality after heart transplantation, accounting for nearly 50% of reported deaths. It is often difficult to clinically distinguish between rejection and infection because they are both inflammatory processes with similar, nonspecific symptoms. However, this differential is essential for determining therapy. Identifying laboratory methods that will permit safe and concise early differentiation between rejection and infection in the transplant patient will improve outcomes. We established an ACUC protocol that allowed us to study whether gene microarray analysis of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) would reliably differentiate acute heart rejection from infection in the transplanted rat. The ACUC protocol also allowed us to do pilot studies necessary to support the main protocol.  We established the surgical techniques necessary to successfully perform and maintain the rat transplant model.  We determined the dose of cyclosporin (CSA) in this model that reliably suppresses rejection during its administration, but will permit the emergence of Grade 3 rejection upon its discontinuation. We have also determined the appropriate inoculant of intra-bronchial E. coli bacteria that is sufficient to cause a pneumonia and a systemic inflammatory response without being immediately lethal in transplanted rats receiving CSA. In addition, we have used gene microarry technology to study the impact of animal strain on gene expression during rejection (BMC Genomics 10:280, 2009) and the time course of post-surgical inflammatory changes in order to determine the most opportune time to harvest the transplanted hearts (i.e. when gene microarry signatures due to surgical inflammatory changes are dissipating). We have also completed the main study protocol. Our main protocol combines two well-established rat models, the first is a heterotopic heart transplantation model and the second is an E. coli pulmonary infection model. All rats underwent heart transplantation on day 0 in conjunction with daily CSA (10 mg/kg subcutaneous) to suppress rejection. After transplant, animals were randomized at day 6 to have CSA discontinued, in order to initiate rejection, or continued, in order to further suppress rejection. After discontinuing CSA the animals were again randomized on day 13 to receive intrabronchial E. coli inoculation or saline inoculation. Consequently, four groups (2 by 2 design) were studied: no rejection (i.e. receiving CSA) without infection, no rejection (i.e. receiving CSA) with infection, rejection (i.e. not receiving CSA) without infection, and rejection (i.e. not receiving CSA) with infection. On day 14, all animals were sacrificed and the blood and heart removed for gene microarray analysis. Other analytic tools that may be employed include: RT-PCR, western blot, in-situ hybridization, proteomics, immunehistochemistry, and histopathology. In addition, the animals' hearts, lungs, spleen, liver, and thymus were procured in the primary study and preserved for potential future analysis. A total of 124 rats were used over the duration of the protocol, which was closed in 2012. However we are continuing to process and analyze data related to the metabolic effects of rejection on cellular energy metabolism (JHLT 36 (4S):S372-S373, 2017); the effects of surgical inflammation over time on gene expression; and the effects of acute cellular rejection and/or infection on gene expression.  During the 2016-17 reporting period we entered into a collaboration with the Laboratory of Transplantation Genomics (LTG) of the NHLBI. The main objective of the collaboration is to develop a protocol for processing DNA derived from formalin-fixed tissue for methylatomic sequencing. As part of regular transplant care, lung and heart transplant recipients undergo regular and clinically-scheduled biopsies to monitor for acute rejection with excess biopsy tissue being stored in formalin. We provided LTG with 10 paraffin blocks of formalin-fixed rat cardiac transplant tissues from this protocol. One mg of this tissue was used for DNA isolation and suitable yields and quality of DNA has been obtained for down-stream analysis. The plan is to use the DNA for bisulfite treatment and methylation sequencing and then compare the epigenetic landscape with known cardiac specific signatures (https://www.genboree.org/epigenomeatlas/index.rhtml). If this analysis yields a significant correlation, then it may be possible to use formalin fixed human allotransplant cardiac tissue for epigenetic profiling. Recently, epigenetic profiling has emerged as a useful tool to study the pathogenesis and progression of transplant-related complications."
"9443858","PROJECT SUMMARY The broad objective of the current application is to advance our understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms of preclinical left ventricular diastolic dysfunction (PDD) (Stage B heart failure) in humans with type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) and to develop novel therapeutic strategies to prevent the progression to symptomatic heart failure (Stage C heart failure). Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that the number of Americans with DM has grown to 30 million people, or 9.3% of the U.S. population, with 90% to 95% of cases being type 2 DM. This application will focus only on type 2 DM. DM is strongly associated with the development of heart failure (HF) which is a major cause of death. We have previously reported that between 23-54% of DM patients have preclinical diastolic dysfunction (PDD) or Stage B heart failure determined by echo Doppler. More importantly, we determined that diastolic dysfunction was associated with increased risk of the subsequent development of HF after adjustment for age, sex, body mass index, hypertension, coronary disease and echo parameters (HR=1.67, 95% CI=1.27-2.23; p<0.001). The cumulative probability of development of HF for DM patients with PDD was 37% at 5 years compared to 17% at 5 years for DM patients without diastolic dysfunction (P<0.001). Cyclic guanosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cGMP) is the second messenger of the natriuretic peptide system and the nitric oxide system. cGMP plays an important role in the preservation of myocardial, vascular and renal function. Disruption of this signal transduction process may contribute to the development of cardiorenal dysfunction. Preclinical studies and the applicant's preliminary clinical data suggest that there is an impaired cGMP generation in response to the activation of the endogenous natriuretic peptides (NPs) in DM. The mechanism of impaired cGMP generation in DM to endogenous NPs is not well defined and may be due to the lack of biologically active NPs, increased NPs degradation or down regulation of NP receptors. Neprilysin is a zinc-dependent metalloprotease that cleaves peptides at the amino side of hydrophobic residues and inactivates several peptide hormones, including the NPs. Angiotensin receptor neprilysin inhibitor (ARNI) is a new class of therapeutic agents that combines neprilysin and angiotensin receptor inhibitor, potentiates the cGMP system and is approved for the management of Stage C systolic HF. However, the cardiorenal renal action of ARNI in human DM with and without PDD (Stage B HF) has not been well defined. We have previously demonstrated that neprilysin inhibition in experimental HF improves cardio-renal function associated with increasing endogenous NPs. Hence, ARNI may be used as a tool to provide insight into the mechanism of impaired cGMP generation in DM by inhibition of endogenous NPs degradation. Building on our know-how in protein biology, we have succeeded in creating a bivalent chimeric peptide that can activate 2 distinct molecular signaling pathways: CRRL 094 is a unique peptide that combines the biological properties of natriuretic peptide and Insulin, resulting in the activation of cGMP and the secretion of insulin. This novel peptide may be beneficial in DM with PDD to control hyperglycemia and the cardiorenal protective actions of the NPs to prevent the development of stage C HF.Our Specific Aims are as follows: Specific Aim 1: To perform high definition phenotyping of DM with and without PDD, defining the differential cardiorenal response to acute saline volume expansion. Hypothesis: DM with PDD has greater impaired cGMP and cardiorenal response to acute volume expansion Specific Aim 2: To determine the effects of exogenous B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) or neprilysin inhibition with ARNI (LCZ 696) on the cardiorenal and humoral response to acute saline volume expansion in DM with and without PDD. Hypothesis: DM with PDD has an attenuated response to ARNI but preserved response to exogenous BNP. Specific Aim 3: To define in an experimental model of type 2 Diabetic cardiomyopathy, the biological and potential therapeutic actions of a novel bivalent chimeric insulin secreting natriuretic peptide, CRRL 094 Hypothesis: The bivalent chimeric peptide will control hyperglycemia and have beneficial cardiorenal actions beyond insulin alone or insulin + ARNI. To address these objectives related to PDD with DM, we will pursue translational high definition physiological human and animal studies taking advantage of the extensive clinical facilities, patient populations, the NIH funded Center for Clinical and Translational Science (CCaTS) at the Mayo Clinic and also the cardiorenal research laboratory, which makes our proposed research highly feasible, innovative and of significant clinical importance."

"9600195","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Although Combination Antiretroviral Therapy (cART) is very potent in suppressing HIV replication and therefore life-prolonging, it can't eradicate HIV 1 infection. HIV can persist in long-lived resting memory CD4+ T cells. This reservoir of latent HIV-1 proviruses is the principal impediment to eradication of HIV infection. The current widely discussed and tested approach to eliminate the latent reservoirs is the so-called sock and kill strategy. It is hypothesized that reactivating latent HIV ('shock') in the presence of cART and immune-based therapy would ('kill') purge these reservoirs. In eukaryotic cells, the level of gene expression is strictly regulated by epigenetic modifications on chromatin including histone modifications and DNA methylation. The repressive status of chromatin largely contributes to HIV latency. In this proposal, we have identified a novel molecular mechanism of repressing HIV-LTR mediated transcription at epigenomic level. Importantly, we found that a small molecule inhibitor of a key epigenetic enzyme could reactivate HIV in two HIV latency cell models. In the R21 phase of this proposal, we will (1) further dissect the molecular basis of epigenetic regulation of HIV latency, and (2) evaluate our small molecular inhibitor in a primary CD4+ T cells model. In the R33 phase, using our small molecular inhibitor as a prototype, we will develop more specific and potent small molecule inhibitors, and determine whether these compounds can reactivate latent HIV in patients' samples. The potential synergistic effect of our compounds with other established HIV latency- reversing agents will also be evaluated. In summary, our proposed studies will likely uncover new mechanisms of regulation of HIV latency at the epigenomic level. Most importantly, based on our mechanistic studies, we might be able to develop a novel class of epigenetic compounds for reactivation of the latent HIV."
"9449675","Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infection permanently afflicts over half of all Americans, is the most common infectious cause of birth defects, and threatens the lives of thousands of children and adults with impaired immune systems. New strategies to stop the infection are urgently needed because current antiviral drugs are inadequate and a vaccine is non-existent. Our ultimate goal is to discover ways of immediately blocking HCMV infection, which may be reasonably achieved through selective disruption of viral gene expression. Toward this goal, the objective of this research project is to determine the mechanisms utilized by HCMV to regulate transcription of its genome during the course of an active infection. We hypothesize that HCMV adopts the basic host principles of transcription control of the RNA polymerase II, but modifies this host machinery through the actions of viral products. We further hypothesize that the major HCMV MIE proteins are central to orchestrating the temporal cascade of viral transcription, while also differentially modulating host transcription. The planned experiments will examine in-depth the transcriptional regulation of both HCMV and host genomes using powerful global techniques (ChIP-Seq, PRO-Seq, and RNA-Seq), novel in vitro systems (customized nuclear walk-on assays), originally crafted reagents (HCMV mutants), and a newly developed technology for rapidly and robustly eliminating proteins of interest to unravel their role in HCMV transcriptional regulation. The plan integrates the biochemical and molecular expertise of the Price Lab in transcription control and global techniques and the extensive experience of Meier Lab in HCMV virology and gene expression. The results of these experiments will be the first to determine the extent to which HCMV applies recently discovered mechanisms controlling animal gene expression, as well as the roles of the HCMV MIE proteins in commandeering this vital process. Results obtained through the combined efforts of the Meier and Price Labs will be applicable to understanding transcriptional regulation not only of HCMV, but all DNA viruses. The work proposed here will set the groundwork for future studies aimed at controlling infections of HCMV, HSV, EBV, and other viruses."
"9586374","Project Summary  Delirium in the intensive care unit (ICU) affects as many as 80% of critically ill, mechanically ventilated adults. Delirium is associated with substantial negative outcomes, including increased complications during hospitalization and long term effects on cognitive function and health status in ICU survivors. Sleep disturbances, iatrogenic/environmental factors, and biobehavioral factors may affect risk of delirium. This randomized clinical trial will test the effectiveness of a nonpharmacologic intervention to prevent delirium. The Family Automated Voice Reorientation (FAVoR) intervention uses scripted audio messages, recorded by the patient's family and played at hourly intervals during daytime hours, to provide information about the ICU environment to the patient; this ongoing orientation to the ICU environment through recorded messages in a voice familiar to the patient may enable the patient to more accurately interpret the environment and thus reduce risk of delirium. Increasing awareness of daytime by cuing patients during waking hours may also improve day/night orientation and nighttime sleep, further reducing risk of delirium. The primary specific aim of the project is to test the effect of the FAVoR intervention on delirium in critically ill, mechanically ventilated adults during hospitalization in the ICU. Secondary aims are to: (1) explore if the effect of FAVoR on delirium is mediated by sleep, (2) explore if selected biobehavioral factors may potentially moderate the effects of FAVoR on delirium, and (3) examine the effects of FAVoR on short term (immediately after ICU discharge) and long term (1 and 6 months after hospital discharge) outcomes, including cognitive function and patient-reported health status. A prospective, randomized, experimental design will be used to accomplish the specific aims. Subjects (n=178) will be randomly assigned to one of two groups (intervention or control) within 36 hours of intubation and ICU admission. The intervention group will receive FAVoR over a 5-day period, while the control group will not. Delirium free days, the primary outcome measure, will be assessed by Confusion Assessment Method (CAM-ICU) over the 5 day period. During the 5 day period, continuous polysomnography and actigraphy data and data related to iatrogenic/environmental and biobehavioral factors will be collected. After ICU discharge and at 1 and 6 months post-hospital discharge, follow up data (including cognitive function, patient reported health status, polysomnography, and actigraphy) will be collected. The effect of FAVoR on delirium free days will be tested using a Chi-square test; if there are unbalanced covariates, then covariance adjustment will be performed by using logistic regression that includes both the treatment assignment and the unbalanced covariates. Partial least square structural equation models will be used to analyze the relative importance and the pathways of secondary aim variables. FAVoR holds promise for reducing delirium in critically ill adults, improving sleep in the ICU, and secondarily benefitting cognitive function and health status in ICU survivors."
"9555578","Autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome is a rare genetic disorder characterized by defective FAS-mediated apoptosis, autoimmune disease, accumulation of mature T-cell receptor alpha/beta positive, CD4 and CD8 double-negative T cells and increased risk of lymphoma. Despite frequent hematologic abnormalities, literature is scarce regarding the bone marrow pathology in autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome. To investigate bone marrow findings in these patients, we retrospectively reviewed 31 bone marrow biopsies from a cohort of 240 patients with germline FAS mutations. All biopsies were performed for the evaluation of cytopenias or to rule out lymphoma. Clinical information was collected and morphological, immunohistochemical, flow cytometric and molecular studies were performed. Bone marrow lymphocytosis was the predominant feature, present in 74% (23/31) of biopsies. The lymphoid cells showed several different patterns of infiltration, most often forming aggregates comprising T cells in 15 cases, B cells in one and a mixture of T and B cells in the other seven cases. Double-negative T cells were detected by immunohistochemistry in the minority of cases (10/31; 32%); significantly, all but one of these cases had prominent double-negative T-lymphoid aggregates, which in four cases diffusely replaced the marrow space. One case showed features of Rosai-Dorfman disease, containing scattered S-100+ cells with emperipolesis and double-negative T cells. No clonal B or T cells were detected by polymerase chain reaction in any evaluated cases. Classical Hodgkin lymphoma was identified in three cases. Our results demonstrate that infiltrates of T cells, or rarely B cells, can be extensive in patients with autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome, mimicking lymphoma. A multi-modality approach, integrating clinical, histological, immunohistochemical as well as other ancillary tests, can help avoid this diagnostic pitfall.  We investigated expression of the B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA) in cases of multiple myeloma in collaboration with Dr. Kochenderfer, NCI. Therapies with novel mechanisms of action are needed for patients with multiple myeloma. Dr. Kochenderfe conducted the first-in-humans clinical trial of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells targeting BCMA. T-cells expressing the CAR used in this work (CAR-BCMA) specifically recognized BCMA-expressing cells. Twelve patients received CAR-BCMA T cells in this dose-escalation trial. Among the 6 patients treated on the lowest 2 dose levels, limited anti-myeloma activity and mild toxicity occurred. On the third dose level, 1 patient obtained a very good partial remission. Two patients were treated on the fourth dose level of 9  10(6) CAR(+) T cells/kg body weight. Before treatment, the first patient on the fourth dose level had chemotherapy-resistant multiple myeloma, making up 90% of bone marrow cells. After treatment, bone marrow plasma cells became undetectable by flow cytometry, and the patient's myeloma entered a stringent complete remission that lasted for 17 weeks before relapse. The second patient on the fourth dose level had chemotherapy-resistant myeloma making up 80% of bone marrow cells before treatment. Twenty-eight weeks after this patient received CAR-BCMA T cells, bone marrow plasma cells were undetectable by flow cytometry, and the serum monoclonal protein had decreased by >95%. This patient is in an ongoing very good partial remission. Both patients treated on the fourth dose level had toxicity consistent with cytokine-release syndrome including fever, hypotension, and dyspnea. Both patients had prolonged cytopenias. These findings demonstrated for the first time anti-myeloma activity of CAR-BCMA T cells.  Host-related immunodeficiency is known to play a role in the development of multiple myeloma (MM) from its precursor conditions (monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance, MGUS, smoldering multiple myeloma, SMM). In order to understand the underlying immune changes in this process, we characterized immune patterns from MGUS to SMM to MM. We further sought to identify potential novel immune biomarkers that may predict progression of SMM to MM. We characterized patterns of circulating lymphocytes in 181 patients using multiparametric flow cytometry. We found decreased B- (p=.0003), increased T- (p=.037) and unaltered NK cell proportions from MGUS to SMM to MM. To gain insights into functional variability, we further characterized immunophenotypic lymphocyte subsets, which uncovered differences in CD57 subsets. Specifically, we found that SMM patients who eventually progressed to MM showed decreased proportions of CD57-CD56+(p=.0061) and CD57-CD16+(p=.035) lymphocyte subsets. We thus report novel data characterizing the nature of host-related immunodeficiency in the development of MM. We show sequential changes in lymphocyte subsets from MGUS to SMM to MM. We further suggest that CD57 subsets may serve as potential markers of progression from SMM to MM. Our findings support the study of lymphocyte subsets in the search for immune biomarkers. Such markers could provide clinical guidance in managing myeloma precursor disease.  Disease progression in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) treated with ibrutinib has been attributed to histologic transformation or acquired mutations in BTK and PLCG2. The rate of resistance and clonal composition of progressed disease are incompletely characterized. In collaboration with Dr. Wiestner, NHLBI, we have reviewed histopathological findings in CLL patients treated with single-agent ibrutinib on an investigator-initiated phase 2 trial. With median follow-up of 34 months, 15 of 84 evaluable patients (17.9%) progressed. Relapsed/refractory disease at study entry, TP53 aberration, advanced Rai stage, and high -2 microglobulin were independently associated with inferior progression-free survival (P < .05 for all tests). Histologic transformation occurred in 5 patients (6.0%) and was limited to the first 15 months on ibrutinib. In contrast, progression due to CLL in 10 patients (11.9%) occurred later, diagnosed at a median 38 months on study. At progression, mutations in BTK (Cys481) and/or PLCG2 (within the autoinhibitory domain) were found in 9 patients (10.7%), in 8 of 10 patients with progressive CLL, and in 1 patient with prolymphocytic transformation. Applying high-sensitivity testing (detection limit 1 in 1000 cells) to stored samples, mutations were detected up to 15 months before manifestation of clinical progression (range, 2.9-15.4 months). In 5 patients (6.0%), multiple subclones carrying different mutations arose independently, leading to subclonal heterogeneity of resistant disease. For a seamless transition to alternative targeted agents, patients progressing with CLL were continued on ibrutinib for up to 3 months, with 19.8 months median survival from the time of progression."
"9395934","Heart failure (HF) affects nearly 6 million individuals in the US, one of every eight death certificates lists HF as a primary or contributing cause of death, and HF is associated with a significant reduction in quality of life for patients and caregivers alike. Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) has represented one of the most important advances in the care of select patients with HF. Although CRT has substantially improved outcomes among HF patients, it is widely recognized that approximately 1/3 of patients who undergo this invasive procedure do not derive clinical improvements. Research on causes of CRT non-response and approaches to mitigating non-response is a priority in the fields of HF and electrophysiology. Although many important questions can be answered through national registries and secondary analyses of landmark trials, lack of data granularity and adjudicated outcomes in registries, and small numbers of patients in key subgroups in trials, limit these approaches. Our group has successfully used Bayesian statistical methods to combine primary patient-level data from RCTs of the implantable cardioverter defibrillator. We propose that a similar approach for CRT trials, combined with stakeholder prioritization and a decision modeling framework, have the power to overcome many important limitations of existing platforms for CRT research.  Our long-term goal is to enhance the ability of the NHLBI to provide evidence-based decisionmaking tools to aid patients, providers, and policymakers in the use of CRT for the treatment of HF. To achieve this overall goal, we have four specific aims (SA): (1) To work with diverse stakeholders to identify and prioritize timely clinical and policy questions regarding the comparative effectiveness of CRT; (2) To develop a generalizable decision modeling framework for the treatment of HF; (3) To use Bayesian statistical techniques to devise a model for predicting patient and population health and economic outcomes; and (4) To combine the framework from SA#2, the Bayesian model from SA#3, and patient level data from existing RCTs and registries, to explore high-priority questions identified in SA#1. Our research will build off our team's expertise and experience in research prioritization, evidence synthesis, chronic disease modeling, Bayesian statistical techniques, stakeholder engagement, and methods of disseminating evidence-based decision models to patients, providers, and policymakers. We will collaborate with principal investigators from existing trials of CRT to harness the power of patient-level data from over ten years of clinical trials representing nearly 10,000 patients and use registry data to explore whether the outcomes observed in the community are predicted by available RCT evidence. In an era in which great importance is placed on defending clinical practice with rigorous supporting evidence, our research brings together stakeholder engagement, decision analytic methods, Bayesian statistics, the strength of RCT data, and medical informatics tools to enhance patient outcomes and provide powerful methods to aid patients, providers, and policy makers in their decisionmaking."
"9557287","Background  Megakaryocytes (MK) comprise a rare cell population in the bone marrow, making up an estimated 0.1-0.5% of the total nucleated cells. Numerical and morphologic abnormalities of MK are described in a variety of primary and secondary marrow disorders but the scarcity of these cells makes analysis difficult and enrichment techniques for subsequent cell analysis are complex and labor intensive.  Currently, MK changes are assessed exclusively on microscopic preparations (marrow aspirates and biopsies), and are used as important criteria for disease diagnosis, classification and therapy monitoring despite the inherent subjectivity of microscopic evaluations. In contrast to other hemopoietic or lymphoid cells, adequate quantitative studies of freshly isolated MK have proven difficult because of the relative rarity of these cells. Even flow cytometry (FCM), which is ideal for rapid detection of infrequent cell populations, faces serious difficulties in the assessment of marrow MK and the analysis of these cells is not part of the routine diagnostic work up of marrow cells in clinical laboratories.  MK can be isolated using separation techniques such as density gradients, magnetic beads, centrifugal elutriation or fluorescence activated cell sorting, but these are labor-intensive, time-consuming or costly methods. Mature marrow MK are large, polyploid cells and it has been shown that their size distribution overlaps minimally with that of all other marrow cells. This distinct size threshold implies that size alone is a discriminatory parameter for MK isolation. Thus, we developed a simple and inexpensive manual mesh filtration method for separation of MK that allows a rapid and easy size-based concentration and purification of these cells.    Materials and Methods  We examined 15 discarded anonymized BM aspirate samples suitable for our analysis.  These samples were from patients with a variety of hematologic disorders originally submitted to our laboratory for evaluation.  Sample age ranged from 1-4 days (mean 1.5 days).  Samples were diluted with a buffered saline solution and the cell suspensions were filtered through meshes of appropriate size.  This filtration procedure allowed the preferential retention of MKs and, on average, the procedure only lasted 15 minutes.  The resulting cell suspensions were stained with FITC-anti CD61 or PE-anti CD41a antibodies Becton Dickinson (BD) to label MKs, concurrently with the cell permeable DNA-binding DRAQ5 (Cell Signaling Technology) to identify all nucleated cells.  Final cell viability was assessed by C12Resazurin (Molecular probes).  Cell analysis was performed by flow cytometry (FCM) using a CANTO II flow cytometer (BD).  Absolute MK enumeration was performed using the Flow Cytometry Absolute Count Standard beads (Bangs).  MK enrichment efficiency was expressed as the percentage of MKs of all nucleated cells determined by FCM.   Results and Conclusions  The median (range) volume of the BM samples used in this study was 0.54 (0.24-1.99) mL.  MKs were identified by FCM on the basis of their large size, expression of platelet-associated antigens and DNA ploidy levels. The median (range) MK recovery was 31 (14-100) % of the original number of MKs and the yield was 9,882 (1,519-49,921) MKs per mL of BM aspirate.  The median (range) fraction of MKs among all nucleated cells after filtration was 39 (14-68) %, representing a 904 (439-3029)-fold MK enrichment.  The MK viability after filtration was near 100%. This rapid and inexpensive isolation and concentration method results in a MK recovery and purification that is comparable or better than other more elaborate techniques.  Despite the inherent heterogeneity of the samples used, we obtained a reasonably good recovery of MKs per mL of marrow aspirate and more than 900-fold median MK concentration.  The yield and level of purification of freshly isolated MKs obtained by thiiis simple procedure may be useful in studies of a variety of primary or secondary marrow disorders.  In particular, it should facilitate the application of analytical methods such as flow cytometry or in situ hybridization, and even be useful for biochemical or molecular testing that requires adequate cell representation and purity.  Current Studies   Using flow cytometry, we are presently determining DNA content (ploidy) and expression of a variety of surface antigens in MKs isolated from fresh aspirates as described above in marrows from normal volunteers and patients with a variety of hematologic disorders.  The goal of this study is to establish changes in MK ploidy and/or immunophenotype, if any, in diseases in which MK are expected to be abnormal based on morphological grounds, such as myelodysplasias or myeloproliferative neoplasms.  Unfortunately, the incidence of these disorders at the NIH is currently low.  Furthermore, hematologic patients with marrow disorders in this institution undergo extensive research studies and diagnostic testing that require a significant amount of marrow sample, frequently leaving a relatively scanty amount of material for our studies. For this reason, last year, we entered a collaborative effort with professionals in the Department of Pathology of the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center (WRNMMC) who have access to marrow samples, in order to obtain adequate and representative material for our studies.  This process took a long time and although we received some samples from that institution, the amount and/or quality of the samples was sub-optimal and, in most instances, did not yield a sufficient number of megakaryocytes for appropriate analysis.  We have recently decided to terminate the acquisition of samples for this purpose and analyze the results obtained with the samples already received.  We are analyzing the DNA content (ploidy level) of megakaryocytes in these samples in order to determine the quantity and distribution of the various G1 peaks that reflect nuclear lobe partitions in these cells, as well as the expression of platelet-associated glycoproteins that may be altered in hematologic disorders with morphological MK abnormalities.  We are still collecting selected cases of marrow disorders that affect megakaryocytes for appropriate characterization of changes and comparisons between normal, reactive, dysplastic and proliferative processes.

"9393316","Project Summary  The project goal is to continue exploring the relationship between experience, expertise, and modular organization in the temporal lobe. There are distinct regions of the brain, reproducible from one person to the next, specialized for processing the most universal forms of human expertise; such as face recognition, speech processing, and reading. Face-selective regions in the temporal lobe have been identified using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in both humans and macaques, and in humans visual recognition of letters and words is also localized, to the same part of the temporal lobe, but more lateral and posterior and in the opposite hemisphere. Because of the importance of social interactions in primates, one could imagine a face-specific region being generated by natural selection, but it is unlikely that a cortical region specific for written words could have evolved, given that humans have been using written language for only a few thousand years, and literacy has been widespread for at most a few hundred years. The fact that most people have intensive early experience with both faces and symbols prompted the question of whether intensive early experience could cause monkeys to develop anatomical specializations for stimuli they never naturally use. The project revealed that intensive symbol training can induce the formation of artificial domains in macaque inferotemporal cortex (IT), but only when they were trained as juveniles, not as adults. Furthermore these artificial domains are localized within IT according to a pre-existing proto-architecture. The proposed project is to probe and explore this proto architecture to characterize the constraints on the modifiability of IT. Previous results indicated that this proto-architecture could be a retinotopic-map based shape organization. Therefore the one goal is to find out whether the proto-architecture is more constrained by shape or by retinotopy, by pitting the two features against each other during the training regimen, and using fMRI after training to find out whether novel domains localize according to viewing eccentricity or shape. The major goal is to use chronic multi-electrode arrays to explore the constraints on the modifiability of response properties of individual neurons in IT, and to look for differences in the modifiability of neuronal response properties as a function of the age of the animal and as a function of anteroposterior location along IT. Chronic arrays will be implanted in different regions along the anterior/posterior extent of IT in animals of different ages. Response tuning across the array will be assessed using a large image set. Then the animals will be intensively trained on a subset of those shapes, and, as they are trained, response tuning across the arrays will be monitored. Chronic array electrophysiology and fMRI will be used in parallel and in conjunction to explore the constraints on the formation of training-induced domains and training-induced expertise, and to ask how these constraints change over normal development. The results should lead to a deeper understanding of how early social and educational experience or deprivation affects the developing brain."

"9549530","HIV-infected individuals experience accelerated vascular aging and an increased risk of vascular disorders. Vascular dysfunction, similar to that underlying vascular dementia and depression seen in aging HIV-negative populations, may contribute to the continued high rates of HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders seen in the effective antiretroviral therapy era. One diagnostic marker of vasculopathy is thickening of the vessel wall. Studies have established a correlation between vessel wall thickening and vascular disease manifestations. This prospective, observational study aims to examine the relationships between neurocognitive outcomes and vessel wall thickness as a marker of vascular disease in HIV-infected adults. Study procedures include neuropsychological testing, brain imaging, blood biomarkers, magnetic resonance imaging of the carotid vessel walls and computed tomography of the heart. HIV-infected patients (n=40) and age-, sex-, and race-matched HIV-negative controls (n=40) will be recruited. Participants will be followed for two years, with clinical evaluations every 6 months and repeat imaging studies at 12 and 24 months. Cross-sectional analysis will compare markers of vascular and neurocognitive disorders between HIV-infected and HIV-negative participants. The longitudinal data analysis will assess and compare the temporal progression of vascular disease (imaging and blood biomarker findings) in relation to changes in neurocognitive and depression scores in both groups.   65 participants have enrolled to date, 40 HIV-infected adults and 25 HIV-negative controls. In the first 30 HIV-infected participants with a fully-evaluable data set, 6 (22%) have neurocognitive impairment. Carotid atherosclerosis was identified in 12 (40%). Calcified coronary artery plaque was noted in 15 (50%), with a median coronary artery calcium score of 26 (range 1-2283). Six participants (20%) have both carotid and coronary disease. Research assays and cross-sectional analysis will be completed after the planned target of 40 HIV-negative and 40 HIV-positive participants have completed baseline assessments."
"9607134","PROJECT SUMMARY (See instructions): The goal of the Analytical Cytometry Core (ACC) is to provide the COHCCC members, through its facilities, leading-edge equipment and experienced operators to measure properties of cells and their components, isolate those cells and their components and present the data acquired for internal analysis and external review. Flow cytometry instrumentation available through this core resource includes: 3 high speed cell sorters (MoFlo, BD FACS Aria SORP and BD FACS Aria 111), and 4 analytical cytometers (Cyan, Gallios, LSR Fortessa and C6). The flow cytometry instrumentation provides investigators with the tools to analyze and isolate cells at speeds of up to 20,000 cells/second based on multiple fluorescent labels (up to 18) and light scatter properties with high yield (up to 90% based on speed) and extreme purity (99%). Additionally, the BD Aha 11 SORP is contained in a biosafety cabinet and allows users to sort live (potentially infectious) samples. All instrumentation in the ACC is subject to either daily (sorters and Fortessa) or weekly (Gallios, CyAn, and C6) quality control assessment and routine preventive maintenance and calibration. All data generated in the ACC is available through the institutional cyber-infrastructure network for further analysis and preparation for presentation or publication. Network based data processing software is offered by the core and a Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS) is being developed to help track experiment related meta data and archived file retrieval. Another key role of ACC is to provide flow cytometry training from basic theory, experimental design, software usage and operation of the cytometers to COHCCC members."
"9549512","Rapid molecular methods for identification of pathogens and characterization of resistance mechanisms are essential to clinical infectious disease diagnostics. Our work aims to develop novel applications of mass spectrometry to these problems in the clinical microbiology laboratory. Our approach involves both the identification of new bacterial protein markers and the development of assays to detect these markers using LC-MS/MS and other mass spectrometry technologies. Methods are being pursued for (1) Culture-free identification of pathogenic bacteria in primary specimens, (2) Strain-level classification of bacterial pathogens, and (3) Rapid resistance protein identification.   Previously published work involved identification of a peptide marker for tracking a carbapenemase-carrying resistance plasmid that could be detected by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry (Lau et al, JCM, 2014), followed by a clinical validation study demonstrating the method's utility in identifying KPC carbapenemase proteins in clinical isolates from NIH Clinical Center patients (Youn et al, JCM, 2016).  Work done during the 2016 fiscal year in collaboration with Anthony Suffredini's group in CCMD, NIHCC included the development of a genoproteomics approach for identifying strain-specific peptide markers based on LC-MS/MS profiling of tryptic peptides, using clinical Acinetobacter baumannii isolates as a model  (Wang et al, Clinical Chemistry, 2016). This approach is based on in silico computational analysis to guide selection of informative, genome-specific tryptic peptides from LC-MS/MS peptide profiles, followed by experimental confirmation.   Work completed during the past fiscal year included extension of genoproteomic methods to the design of assays for the culture-free identification of bacteria in primary specimens, published in Wang et al, Clinical Chemistry, 2017.  This proof-of-concept study demonstrated that rapid (90 minute) diagnostic identification of bacterial pathogens in primary specimens may be possible for a variety of specimen types without culture.  The genoproteomic approach was also extended to the direct identification of the KPC carbapenemase in clinical isolates using specific tryptic peptides that can be detected by LC-MS/MS, published in Wang et al, Scientific Reports, 2017.  This method allows a rapid (90 minute) diagnostic mass spectrometry assay for detecting the KPC carbapenemase protein in clinical isolates.  Work is currently underway to extend culture free identification methods to a variety of high impact pathogenic bacteria.  Additionally, work is underway to develop LC-MS/MS assays to detect other carbapenemases and extended spectrum beta lactamses using tryptic peptides and LC-MS/MS, which may be used in multiplex."
"9549448","The protocol was closed to recruitment and remains open only for data analysis. As of February 1, 2017, 326 NIH-registry donors had undergone 343 filgrastim-assisted large-volume apheresis procedures to collect peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) for unrelated NMDP recipients; 11 donors donated PBSC twice, and 9 donated subsequent unstimulated leukocytes. 308 of 326 (95 %) required only a single apheresis procedure to collect an adequate cell dose for transplantation. The mean volume processed per procedure was 19.6 liters, resulting in a procedure average duration of 4.6 hours. A central line was required for venous access in 32 (9.3%) of the 343 procedures. All donors experienced filgrastim-induced fatigue, insomnia, bone pain, or headache, although in only 5% were these effects considered severe. The peak mean leukocyte count after the standard 5-day filgrastim mobilization cycle was 39,500/uL, and the peak mean circulating blood stem cell count (CD34+ cell) following 5-day filgrastim administration was 75.1/uL. Platelet counts fell by a mean of 39% during apheresis, and significant post-apheresis thrombocytopenia (less than 100,000/uL) occurred during 75 of 343 donations (22 %). The mean time to complete recovery from PBSC donation was 1 week, compared with 3 weeks for marrow harvest.    NMDP protocol dictates a vial-based dosing scheme for filgrastim administration, including a minimum dose of 600 and a maximum dose of 1200 micrograms per day, with intermediate doses based on weight (approximately 10 micrograms per kilogram), but rounds to the nearest vial content as supplied by the manufacturer. This scheme limits toxicity at the upper end of dosing, increases CD34 mobilization efficacy at the lower end of dosing, and prevents drug wastage while maximizing dose-response relationships in the intermediate dosing range. In an analysis of the effect of donor demographic factors on stem cell mobilization response to filgrastim, higher total filgrastim dose, greater donor weight, and higher pre-filgrastim platelet count are strongly associated with higher peak CD34 cell mobilization responses, whereas Caucasian ethnicity, female gender, and increasing age are associated with poorer CD34 responses. The ability to use these factors to predict CD34 cell mobilization outcomes has resulted in optimization of filgrastim dosing schedules and apheresis processing volumes, and increased the likelihood of obtaining robust CD34 cell apheresis components for transplant.  Analysis of NMDP recipient outcomes shows that PBSC transplants are associated with reduced times to engraftment, decreased rates of graft rejection, but higher rates of chronic extensive graft versus host disease compared with marrow transplants, such that there is no difference in overall survival, disease free surivival, or leukemia relapse at three years following transplant among the two types of unrelated transplants. Administrative and statistical support for this study is provided by the NMDP National Office. Filgrastim was provided under an IND agreement with Amgen (BB-IND #6821)."
"9572254","Summary:      Research in the Interventional Radiology (IR) lab is motivated by the fact that image guidance and minimally invasive approaches have revolutionized the management of many common diseases.  However, diagnosis and therapy remain distinctly separated from each other in both time and space.  We believe that this gap between diagnosis and therapy can be narrowed by minimally invasive image guided therapies and with the application of novel guidance technologies and engineered vectors.  All research efforts in the IR lab are developed with a clear translational route to the clinic and address areas of urgent clinical need. The IR labs research program is separated into three main areas: electromagnetic (EM) and optical tracking and robotics, drug + device combinations, novel methods of augmentation of ablative energies (RFA, MWA, Laser, IRE, or HIFU).  The diversity of these projects requires an interdisciplinary team of researchers and takes full advantage of the interdisciplinary resources found within the Clinical Center and the Intramural Research Program of the National Institutes of Health.  We believe that combining the imaging tools inherent to interventional radiology with pharmaceuticals and medical devices can make a significant contribution to the future treatment of both localized and systemic diseases, with an emphasis upon cancer therapeutics. Principal projects are: 1) Smart biopsy, 2) OR of the future and, 3) Drugs + devices. Smart biopsy relies upon precise electromagnetic tracking to target tissue to correlate sample with imaging parameters. OR of the future is a broad translational project that integrates a variety of technologies for navigation, automation, and visualization of medical procedures. Sub-projects within the Drug + Device model include: 1) Temperature sensitive liposomes combined with radiofrequency ablation (RFA) or high intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU), 2) Radiofrequency ablation combined with immunotherapy / checkpoint inhibitor therapy, and 3) Development of image-able drug eluting beads (DEB) for transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE). The clinical treatment of solid tumors could be improved by controlling the pharmacologic properties of anticancer therapeutics to deliver a greater dose to the tumor; with conventional drugs, this dose is typically limited by toxic side effects in normal tissues.  Therefore, the efficacy of current anticancer treatments may be improved with advances in drug delivery technologies that have received increased attention in recent years.  The goal of drug delivery in the treatment of cancer is to increase the concentration of a therapeutic agent in the tumor while limiting systemic exposure and subsequent normal tissue toxicity.  The combination of drug delivery technologies with image guided interventions represents a rich field with great translational potential and the ability to bridge the gap between diagnosis and therapy. Diagnosis and therapy remain distinctly separated from each other in time and space. The gap between diagnosis and therapy can be closed by minimally invasive image guided therapies. Real-time, intra-procedural tools will blend diagnosis and therapy into a dynamic, iterative process with improved outcomes. The redefining of surgical-like procedures will be fueled by multi-modality imaging, navigation, visualization, robotics, and automated precision tools. These enabling technologies have not yet been optimally applied to existing clinical problems, especially in minimally-invasive image guided therapies. This presents an opportunity to integrate these technologies into the clinical setting in a validated and cost-effective manner, and to study the impact prior to broad implementation. Image guidance and multimodality navigation will fuel a small revolution in procedural medicine, which presents unprecedented opportunity and challenge. Image guidance and minimally invasive approaches have revolutioniiized themanagement of many common diseases. The miniaturization of surgical interventions has seen the broad adoption of needle or catheter-based procedures such as tumor embolization, brain aneurysm coiling, aortic stent grafting, uterine fibroid embolization, atherosclerosis stenting and angioplasty, and tumor thermal ablation with radiofrequency.  As procedures are becoming less and less invasive, they are more and more targeted and guided by imaging and spatial information. The ability to navigate a medical device to a target based upon multiple windows or multiple modalities should have tremendous advantages in certain settings. The combination of functional and morphologic (metabolic and anatomic) information on the same coordinate system is empowering.  With multiple public and private partners, we have developed a multimodality interventional radiology suite that uses a CT coordinate frame to co-register and co-localize different devices including pre-procedural images, intra-procedural ultrasound, CT, rotational fluoroscopy, robotics, electromagnetic tracking and therapeutic ultrasound, microwave, radiofrequency, etc. to allow the best combinations of techniques and guidance methods tailored to the particular patients needs. Combining imaging modalities can take advantage of each modality's strength. Real-time feedback and temporal resolution of ultrasound can be combined with the functional and metabolic data from PET and the spatial resolution of MR or CT, all on one seamless platform for treatment planning, targeting, procedural navigation, monitoring, and verification of treatment.The lab has continued the electromagnetic tracking clinical trial with over 2000 patients. The lab also further studied Medical GPS for tumor ablation and treatment planning and for prostate biopsies using MRI information without requiring an MRI to be physically present. We have also started work in preparation for using other vendor's ultrasound source images for fusing real time ultrasound with pre-op images (CT, MRI, PET, etc).  A novel use of the smartphone gyroscope as a handheld approach to needle positioning has led to an application soon to be available to the public.   This study yielded numerous discoveries, papers, and commercialized products. Also as a result of this work, numerous vendors in the field have adopted similar multi-modality approaches. Early Phase of laser ablation of prostate cancer under MRI guidance was completed and Phase II-III work is scheduled top begin in October 2017 for using ultrasound alone to guide the prostate cancer ablation. Low tech, low cost methods for navigation continued, including laser guidance for needle based biopsy and ablation, and bronchoscopy navigation and laser ablation development. Preclinical work is in process for focal prostate therapies (laser ablation with real-time MRI fluoroscopy) and clinical studies to plan and deliver a composite ablation treatment. A clinical trial is underway to study angle selection techniques and assess accuracy of CT integrated robot-like devices. Drug eluting beads as a tool for regional therapies was refined in preclinical models and will be combined with image-able beads that show where the drug is being delivered in liver chemoembolization with drug dluting beads. Image-able drug eluting beads are being studied and refined in preclinical models and clinic, in order to develop drug dose planning software. Conductive catheters and endovascular devices and embolization devices were studied and prototyped, and NIH patents were issued on devices. Optical needle endoscopy was prototyped and will be tested in CC patients next FY. Optical needle endoscopy will be tested under a UO1 grant and preclinical studies have started with anticipation of first in human in FY 2018."
"9535709","Project Summary The Clinical Cell and Vaccine Production Facility is a Shared Resource of the Abramson Cancer Center (ACC) that is jointly managed with the Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania. Bruce Levine, PhD, Barbara and Edward Netter Professor in Cancer Gene Therapy, has overseen the Facility since its inception, initially as a pilot Facility and then a developing Facility in 1999. The mission of the Facility is to facilitate translation of bench-to-bedside research in novel allogeneic and autologous cell-based vaccines and experimental gene therapies. The Facility performs cell and biologic processing and expansion on a range of different cell types, including peripheral blood and umbilical cord blood derived CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes, monocyte derived dendritic cells, and bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells in support of first-in-human and early Phase I and II cell and gene therapy clinical trials, with an emphasis on cancer. The Facility provides a range of services to ACC investigators to support preclinical process development and validation experiments for successful Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) clinical translation, clinical trial manufacturing, and specified testing for cell and gene therapy products for human administration. Notable accomplishments facilitated by the Facility have been first-in-human trials, including the first use of a lentiviral vector, the first infusions of zinc finger nuclease genome-modified cells, and the first use of lentivirally-modified cells to treat cancer. In 2005, with a considerable investment of non-Core Grant Funds from the University of Pennsylvania Health System, the Abramson Cancer Center and the Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, this facility expanded into a newly renovated 10-room GMP suite within the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania (HUP). In 2013, demonstrating continued and significantly increasing investigator usage of the Facility the Facility opened a second 10-room GMP suite in HUP (with additional investment of non-Core funds), effectively doubling capacity. These facilities are the only spaces on campus that can perform cell and tissue processing in compliance with FDA regulations 21 CFR Parts 210 and 211. Since 1999, Dr. Levine and the Facility have supported >30 FDA Investigational New Drug Applications at Penn and external institutions and produced over 2000 cellular vaccines that have been safely administered to more than 700 patients. The Facility currently supports manufacturing for 18 investigational new drug applications (INDs). The quality and the quantity of projects and clinical products generated in the Facility are recognized among collaborating institutions and pharmaceutical partners. In the reporting period (10/01/13-09/30/14), 19 investigators used the Facility, of which ACC member usage represents 58%. CCSG support represents 2% of the proposed Facility budget with the remaining funding coming from charge backs and other grants/contracts."

Case Flow Processing (Case Status Change Model and Queuing Theory): This project aims to develop methods to analyze system timeliness, measure processing times, and derive optimal flow characteristics. Our work in the area of system timeliness took on two complementary directions. To study system delays, we built a queuing model for the adjudication system that allows the user to obtain system performance statistics. Addressing the separation between wait times and processing time is our second direction of inquiry. For this purpose, we developed a batch processing model. To date, we have scripted code to obtain the needed transition probabilities, determined the rate at which jobs enter the system, completed the queue code, and estimated the distributions of processing/waiting times by using three techniques.   Data Mining Feasibility Study: The aim of this project is to extract functional information from clinical documentation. In order to identify functional information, it is necessary to understand the variation in text used in clinical documentation, noting those rich in functional information and those focusing on health conditions. Therefore, this project has two main goals: characterize medical documentation with respect to functional language; and, extract functional information from samples of medical documentation data. In 2017, the project team focused on functional mobility, as described in the WHOs ICF. The techniques developed from this project will have immediate application to the SSA disability determination process by locating instances where information on claimant function can be found in medical records.  Denied CAL  The aim of this project is to provide recommendations for changes to SSAs business rules to improve the precision of the CAL software, i.e., increase the allowance rate for cases selected by the CAL software. The NIH team provided SSA with seven recommendations for rule sets for CAL UID 204 (Adult Non-Hodgkins Lymphoma). While SSA reviewed these recommendations, NIH continued to work on the IAA year end project deliverables, specifically, to provide recommendations for all eight CAL conditions initially selected. To that end, we began working with CAL UIDs 62 (Early-Onset Alzheimer Disease), 68 (Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis), and 151 (Malignant Melanoma with Metastases). We generated rule sets for these three conditions using the methods previously developed for CAL UID 29 and 204. After examination of initial results, NIH proceeded to integrate additional pre-processing and feature selection capabilities into existing methods. These steps helped to moderately improve performance while also producing more contained, consistent rule sets. Recommendations for these three CAL conditions (UID 63, 68, 151) were provided to SSA for review in June. The SSA-NIH project team agreed that NIH would continue with analysis of the remaining three CAL conditions while SSA reviews the June outcomes.   NIH also began looking at rule simplification methods. These methods are intended to simplify and produce more compact rule sets that can be run as an alternative to SSAs existing business rules rather than an addition to the current rules. While the analytical methods already exist, the relevant software supporting implementation of the methods is rather limited. The objective of this work is to provide SSA the opportunity to select the most appropriate tool for use within the agency.   Based on project discussions with SSA, the NIH team also reviewed more general data about the eight selected CAL conditions. From this review, we generated statistics for comparison across conditions. While these statistics might not have a direct impact on the recommended rule sets, the NIH team hopes these data may be informative to SSA and may assist in reviewing the rule sets or CAL cases.  CAT development (Objective 2)  The NIH/RMD previously awarded a contract to the Boston University Health and Disability Research Institute (BU-HDRI) to develop a comprehensive set of tools to characterize the full continuum of individual capabilities (i.e. human function) relevant to work. This method uses Computer Adaptive Testing (CAT) coupled with Item Response Theory (IRT).   The development of CAT tools (also known as the Functional Assessment Battery or FAB) is a sequential process; one step must be completed before advancing to the next step. A calibration study was conducted to refine the item pools for the Daily Activities and Learning and Applying Knowledge. Additionally, Westat, a research survey firm, conducted replenishment testing of items for the first two domains, physical function and behavioral health, as well as legacy validation on all item pools. Boston University has embarked on a number of additional post development studies to enhance the functionality, utility, and comprehensiveness of the instruments. NIH plans to monitor claimant outcomes for a period of two years, assessing the predictive capacity of the instruments developed under this protocol. Upon expiration of the period of performance for this contract, BU-HDRI submitted a final report detailing efforts during the collaboration. NIH executed a new contract with BU this FY to continue refinement of the instruments and explore implementation opportunities within the SSA process. We completed a national study to replenish the items utilized in the IRT/CAT instrument."
"9549478","Summary: (at least 500 but no more the 7900 characters including spaces) At present, there are no clear guidelines as to when antiretroviral (ARV) therapy for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) should be stopped in the setting of elevated liver enzymes. In large part, this is due to a limited understanding of the natural history of ARV-related hepatotoxicity. We have undertaken a pilot study (Caryn Morse is PI) to estimate the prevalence of hepatic fibrosis in a cohort of HIV-infected patients who have chronically elevated transaminases while on ARV therapy in the absence of Hepatitis B (HBV) or C (HCV) coinfection.  Liver biopsy specimens are being evaluated for fibrosis by microscopic examination, the current gold standard for assessing the nature and severity of liver disease. Fibrosis, as well as other histopathology, is being measured using a validated scoring system. Sixty-two patients have enrolled in the study and undergone liver biopsy. Significant liver abnormalities, primarily steatohepatitis, but also fibrosis, have been seen in the 40 patients. A paper describing the histopathologic abnormalities and clinical correlates of these patients has been published. We plan to continue to follow these patients long-term to better understand the natural history of these liver abnormalities. We have also examined the predictive value of Fibroscans, which were performed in parallel with other evaluations, for identifying fibrosis in patients with elevated transaminases but without HBV or HCV co-infection. This study will provide clinically relevant information on the significance of elevated transaminases in HIV-infected patients without co-infection with HCV or HBV, and facilitate management of such patients.  Biomarkers including D-dimer and IL-6 have been shown to predict mortality in HIV-infected patients, independent of CD4 and viral load. To better understand the mechanism leading to D-dimer elevation, we have undertaken a cross-sectional study to examine markers of coagulation, platelet function, endothelial activation and inflammation, and to identify correlates of elevated D-dimer levels. Our hope is that this analysis will provide insights into which of these pathways is leading to D-dimer elevation. To date we have enrolled approximately 230 HIV+ patients and HIV-volunteers. Preliminary analysis suggests that TNF-alpha, sVCAM, andvon Willebrand Factor correlate with levels of D-Dimer. These data suggest that ongoing monocyte activation plays a role in D-dimer elevation. We have enrolled an additional 60 patients to study the correlates of immunologic non-response in patients receiving HAART, including 30 subjects and 30 controls. We plan to examine immunophenotypic characteristics of the patients, as well as look for evidence of infection with a variety of viral pathogens, including unknown viruses. We are in the process of examining T-cell receptor repertoire diversity, as well as a detailed flow cytometry panel, biomarker panel, and RNA expression levels using microarrays. We are also planning to examine whole exome sequencing of a subset of these patients to see if there are any genetic markers that can distinguish immunologic non-responders from responders to HAART. The goal is to better understand the mechanisms leading to poor immunologic response in HIV-infected patients."
"9404364","Project Summary/Abstract: Pathology Shared Resource (PSR)  The Pathology Shared Resource (PSR) was created to provide Norris Cotton Cancer Center (NCCC)  investigators from different backgrounds (e.g., physicians, basic scientists, diagnosticians) access to a CLIA-  certified, CAP-accredited facility with standardized laboratory protocols for histologic, quantitative imaging and  molecular analysis. The ultimate goal of the PSR is to provide NCCC investigators with state-of-the-art  technical and professional support leading to quality results for clinical and pre-clinical studies. The PSR has  consolidated institutional expertise and experience by combining responsibility for providing for and supporting  both clinical and research utilization of these services. The PSR supports human tissue and cell  procurement/acquisition (i.e., handling, storage, distribution and biobanking); histology and  immunohistochemical analysis; molecular pathology analysis (i.e., genotyping, next-generation sequencing,  quantitative PCR, tissue microarrays; cell processing services); and cytogenetics analysis. The PSR is directed  by Dr. Gregory Tsongalis, who oversees a staff of 12 that includes two Research Associates, two  Histotechnologists, an Apheresis Nurse, and seven additional technical specialists. The PSR is organized to  identify as early as possible the needs of researchers in developing and supporting their translational research  project, providing them with technical support and consultation. Further, many Pathology faculty become  involved in collaborating on individual research projects by reviewing proposals, selecting appropriate tissues,  designing IHC staining and molecular testing algorithms, creating tissue arrays, suggesting alternative  biomarker testing, and scoring IHC expression levels. The PSR has supported NCCC Members in each of the  six Research Programs: Cancer Control (2 members), Cancer Epidemiology (6 members), Cancer  Mechanisms (12 members), Molecular Therapeutics (27 members), Cancer Imaging & Radiobiology (7  members), and Immunology & Cancer Immunotherapy (12 members)."
"9448845","Recurrent breast cancer is typically an incurable disease. Consequently, the tendency of breast cancers to recur following treatment is the most important determinant of clinical outcome. Recurrent tumors invariably arise from the reservoir of residual tumor cells (RTCs) that can persist in patients in a presumed dormant state for many years after treatment of their primary tumor. As such, minimal residual disease, tumor dormancy, and recurrence constitute fundamental manifestations of tumor progression that collectively are responsible for the vast majority of breast cancer deaths. Despite the unrivaled clinical importance of these aspects of breast cancer progression, however, the mechanisms underlying them are largely unknown. Consequently, understanding the biology of RTCs and elucidating the molecular pathways that contribute to tumor dormancy and recurrence is a critical priority in cancer research.  We propose that disabling the survival mechanisms by which dormant RTCs persist in breast cancer patients following treatment will deplete this critical reservoir of cells, reduce tumor recurrence, and thereby improve survival. Using genetically engineered mouse models that faithfully recapitulate tumor dormancy and recurrence, we have determined that uPAR and its binding partner, ?5 integrin, are markedly down-regulated in dormant RTCs, but are subsequently up-regulated, along with FAK activity, in spontaneous recurrent tumors that arise with a stochastic latency period. When taken together with the observations that elevated uPAR and ?5 integrin expression are each strongly associated with an increased risk of recurrence in women with breast cancer, we hypothesize that down-regulation of uPAR and ?5?1 integrin are required for entrance into the dormant state following therapy, and that subsequent up-regulation of uPAR/?5?1/FAK signaling promotes mammary tumor recurrence by inducing the re-entry of dormant RTCs into the cell cycle.  The specific aims of this proposal are to: (1) Define uPAR/?5?1/FAK pathway status in residual disease in mice and in patients. uPAR/?5?1/FAK pathway activation will be evaluated in primary tumors, recurrent tumors, RTC in the mammary gland, and DTC in the BM and lungs in GEM models following targeted therapy or chemotherapy. Companion studies will evaluate the uPAR/?5?1/FAK pathway in BM DTCs, as well as primary and recurrent metastatic tumor cells in breast cancer patients; and (2) Determine the impact of uPAR/?5?1/ FAK pathway modulation on residual disease and recurrence.  By probing the biology of RTCs and the pathways that contribute to tumor recurrence, the proposed studies will advance the therapeutic goals of maintaining tumor cells in a dormant state, inducing their death by targeting their survival mechanisms, or blocking preferred pathways of recurrence. We anticipate that this knowledge will facilitate the development of more effective therapeutic approaches to recurrence that could improve the treatment options available to millions of breast cancer survivors."
"9480105","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Childhood Adversity and Cardiovascular Health among Puerto Rican youth Shakira F Suglia Latinos, the largest and fastest growing ethnic minority group in the United States, are vulnerable to the health related consequences of living in poverty; 32 percent are obese and 22 percent have hypertension. Puerto Rican women have the highest rate of obesity, hypertension and hypercholesterolemia than any other Latino subgroup. Recent research has demonstrated that childhood adversity is associated with cardiovascular disease in adulthood. However, adapting and coping behaviors that prime those exposed to adversity in childhood to develop poor cardiovascular outcomes remain largely unexplored. Understanding how childhood adversity affects obesity, blood pressure and inflammation as well as understanding the potential modifiers and mediators of these associations prior to the development of cardiovascular disease directly addresses the strategic plan of NHLBI to promote early intervention before symptoms of disease appear so as to preserve normal function as long as possible. The goal of this application is to conduct a cardiovascular health assessment of 1,200 Puerto Rican young adults (ages 18-23) living in two different contexts: the South Bronx, NY and San Juan, Puerto Rico. The sample to be recruited is part of the Boricua Youth Study (BYS), a longitudinal (4 waves of data) population-based study that started collecting information when participants were 5 - 13 years old (compliance rate higher than 80 percent in the last completed assessment). In this unique sample of a homogeneous Latino subgroup (Puerto Ricans) in two contexts, we propose to examine: 1) the relation between childhood adversity (negative life events, parental incarceration, psychopathology and substance use, child maltreatment) and selected indicators of cardiovascular heath (obesity, blood pressure and systemic inflammation) in young adulthood; 2) the mediating effect of child mental and substance use disorders; and 3) the role played by socio-cultural factors, including context, social support, acculturation and use of health services The research team has expertise in the study of social determinants of health, the effects of stress on health, as well as on adolescent health. Dr. Suglia (PI) has conducted a feasibility study (K01 HL103199) among BYS participants (N=103; 17-23 years old) in the South Bronx, NY and San Juan, Puerto Rico and has demonstrated good feasibility of cardiovascular health data collection as well as a high prevalence of cardiovascular health indicators of interest (obesity=30 percent; elevated blood pressure=22 percent and high systemic inflammation=23 percent). Extending the study to a larger sample (N=1,200) will allow higher precision in the estimate of cardiovascular measures, as well as the examination of mediators and modifiers of the childhood adversity and cardiovascular health association that can be targeted for prevention efforts among young Puerto Rican (and possibly other Latino) youth prior to the development of cardiovascular disease."
"9607371","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Osteoporosis, a common skeletal degenerative disorder, is characterized by decrease of bone- mass and micro-architectural deterioration of bone tissue. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a most common neurodegenerative disorder with cognitive dementia. Intriguingly, AD patients frequently have lower bone mineral density and higher rate of hip fracture, compared with the same age normal population. Several newly identified AD risk genes/loci encode proteins critical for osteoclastic activation and/or bone-mass homeostasis. Increasing evidence from clinical and genetic studies thus supports a degree of co-morbidity of both disorders. However, very few studies are available to address their relationship. The goal of this proposal is to determine if and how the Swedish mutant amyloid precursor protein (APPswe) acts as a common denominator for AD and osteoporosis/osteopenia. APP is a ubiquitously expressed transmembrane protein. Its cleavage product, A?, is believed to be a major culprit for both early- and late-onset AD. We thus speculate that APP/A? may contribute to the AD-associated skeletal deficits. By use of Tg2576 mice, a well-characterized AD animal model that ubiquitously expresses APPswe under the control of prion promoter, we observed age-dependent osteoporotic bone deficits in this animal model. By use of newly generated conditional/cell type specific APPswe transgenic mouse models, we found that APPswe plays important roles in regulating osteoblast (OB)-mediated bone formation and osteoclast (OC)-mediated bone resorption. However, the underlying mechanisms are unclear. In this proposal, we will address this issue. It is our hope that the results from this research may not only provide a potential link between AD and osteoporosis/osteopenia, but also identify unrecognized functions of APP and reveal new pathological mechanisms underlying both disorders."
"9549427","The activity of cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2) may be altered by calcium or by phosphorylation of serines in the cPLA2 molecule.  Activation of TLR4 receptors or surface receptors by sphingosine 1 phosphate may signal for phosphorylation of cPLA2.  Binding of lipopolysaccharide to TLR4 results in phosphorylation of cPLA2 by MAP Kinases.  This activation of MAP Kinases is mediated by both MyD88 and by TRIF activated through TLR4.  Ongoing studies include the study of cPLA2 activation by low molecular weight fragments of hyaluronic acid, which may be produced at sites of inflammatory events from metabolism of hyaluronan or activation of inflamasome formation.  In addition, the effect of the omega-3 fatty acid, docosahexanoic acid (DHA) on cPLA2 activation via the receptor GP120 has been studied.  Last  year, one manuscript was published.    This study is now closed"
"9377477","Project Summary Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia. AD is expected to increase in prevalence in the coming decades and poses a significant social and economic problem for an aging populace. Recently, a heterozygous mutation on the Triggering Receptor Expressed on Myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) gene was shown to confer one of the highest odds ratios for the development of AD. This mutation was proposed to cause an arginine to histidine (R47H) mutation resulting in loss of TREM2 function. Understanding the function of this TREM2 mutation is crucial to informing novel therapeutics to ameliorate AD. TREM2 is expressed on myeloid cells of the innate immune system, which include peripheral macrophages and resident CNS microglia, and therefore provide a novel target for immune-modulating therapies to treat AD. However, before therapeutics can be developed, the function of TREM2 must be determined. We previously found that TREM2 knockout AD mice had a significant reduction in amyloid plaque burden, neuroinflammation, and a decrease in hyperphosphorylated tau. We also observed a significantly loss of plaque-associated myeloid cells which were identified to be infiltrating macrophages. This was an unexpected finding, as TREM2 loss-of-function should augment AD pathology. This suggests that additional genetic models are needed to study the contribution of TREM2 to AD. In order to address this, we generated a novel TREM2 R47H knock in model using CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing technology. Our preliminary findings show that amyloid plaque number, plaque-associated myeloid cell number, and myeloid cell activation was significantly reduced. Again, these findings are contrary to the expected increase in AD risk. Therefore it is crucial to understand how the TREM2 R47H mutation modulates additional aspects of AD pathology. The goal of the current project is to characterize the myeloid cell component, amyloid homeostasis, and neurodegeneration in the TREM2 R47H AD model. This proposal will provide technical training in isolation of primary microglia for in vitro survival assays, flow cytometry to determine ontogeny of myeloid cells in the brain, and cell sorting to obtain RNA for transcriptome profiling for myeloid cell phenotype. Additionally, this proposal includes training in quantification of soluble vs. insoluble amyloid using ELISA and dot spot assays, and confocal imaging to quantify dystrophic neurites, hyperphosphorylated tau, and neuronal number. Finally, this proposal includes training in the assessment of deficits in spatial learning and memory using Morris water maze and working memory using radial arm water maze. The proposed experiments will test the hypothesis that TREM2 R47H may contribute to poor survival of resident microglia, poor infiltration of peripheral macrophages, or a combination of these processes. Ultimately, this may result in an increase in neurotoxic soluble amyloid, which may result in neurodegeneration and observable cognitive deficits. This proposal will contribute significant insight into the function of TREM2 such that novel therapeutics can be developed to treat of AD."
"9535700","Project Summary The Small Animal Imaging Core has been continuously funded by the CCSG since 2006. Small animals provide invaluable model systems in a broad range of disciplines in cancer research including cancer biology, genetics, immunology, stem cell biology, and experimental therapeutics. Effective utilization of these models often demands application of non-invasive imaging methodologies. These techniques allow for longitudinal studies of disease progression and response to therapy as well as providing unique information that is not accessible via other methodologies. The major impediment to the effective application of these methodologies is that the highly specialized instrumentation and diverse expertise necessary is generally beyond the reach of the individual PI. The Small Animal Imaging Core is the ACC's NCI-approved Shared Resource that provides state-of-the-art instrumentation and a renowned faculty and technical support staff with the expertise necessary to apply a broad range of imaging modalities to small animal models. Supported modalities include magnetic resonance imaging, positron emission tomography, computed tomography, single photon emission computed tomography, ultrasound imaging and optical/bioluminescence imaging. The Core provides limited animal housing for rats and mice, allowing multiple imaging sessions to be performed on a particular animal over an extended period without risking infection of the general population of animals. Since the last renewal, the Core has been physically consolidated, increasing proximity to ACC members. The new space facilitates the efficient application of multiple modalities to a given cohort of animals. In 2013, Dr. James Delikatny was appointed Core Director while Dr. Stephen Pickup continues as the Technical Director. The Core has four sub- Cores led by faculty with extensive experience in applying the respective imaging modality to small animals and nearly half of the users of the Core are ACC members. During the reporting period (10/01/13-09/31/14), 63 investigators have used the Core, with 31 (49%) being ACC members with peer-reviewed funding."

Internal planning and  evaluation includes input from NCCC Members and is secured from regular meetings of NCCC Senior and  Program Leadership, an annual center-wide retreat, and targeted seminars and symposia on key program  developments. Weekly Grand Rounds and monthly Program meetings routinely provide opportunity for  Members to present, hear, and comment on the status of current initiatives and the pending plans of individual  projects. Standing forums for broader NCCC planning and evaluation discussions include the monthly NCCC  Executive Committee, monthly Cancer Research Committee, semi-monthly Senior Leadership meetings, and  weekly Senior Administrative meetings. NCCC Senior Leadership consolidates and publicizes their plans  through annual updating and circulation of a five-year strategic plan. NCCC has developed opportunities to  integrate into broader Dartmouth initiatives. There is extensive representation of NCCC Leadership in  Dartmouth's CTSA (SYNERGY), including co-chair of the CTSA Internal Advisory Committee, and participation  of the Director in senior leadership committees of the medical school and medical center. Application of  planning considerations to current initiatives includes designation of targeted priorities for faculty recruitments,  planning for use of the adjacent Williamson Translational Research Building under construction, the initiation of  new Shared Resources and addition of new services, acquisition of major instrumentation, identifying and  pursuing translational research opportunities, and investment of developmental funds and institutional  resources into strategic priorities. Examples of capitalizing on EAC insights include recruitment in support of  the expansion of Cancer Epidemiology into molecular epidemiology and the extensive new collaboration  between NCCC and The Dartmouth Institute, in the health services delivery component of the Cancer Control  Program, and NCCC's pursuit of an enhanced imaging research initiative in conjunction with the creation of the  NCI-funded Center for Surgical Innovation.

"9535708","Project Summary The Cancer Imaging Core serves ACC investigators with cancer-related clinical trials and translational research that involve imaging biomarkers and/or imaging-related endpoints. The overarching goals of the Core are to facilitate and support the use of high quality, advanced imaging modalities in clinical trials by providing easily accessed, reliable, reproducible, timely and validated imaging data and results in a timely and cost- effective manner. In addition to scientific imaging consultation, the Core provides protocol development services, standardized data acquisition methods for cancer imaging trials, and expert image response assessment analyses. The Core supports investigator access to a variety of cancer imaging methods, both standard clinical imaging studies and novel cancer imaging methods developed by Penn investigators, e.g., cancer imaging biomarker methods. The Core's objectives are to: 1) provide high quality consistent image acquisition processes and image analysis for cancer clinical trials involving imaging endpoints; 2) assist with protocol development, submission and activation of cancer clinical trials that involve imaging modalities; 3) provide scientific consultation to clinical investigators on the most appropriate cancer imaging methods to meet scientific needs; and 4) direct investigators to the appropriate choice of both standard and advanced imaging methodologies in ACC clinical investigations. Users and usage has steadily increased over the current project period, and seven of 11 ACC Programs are actively using the Core services in their scientific studies. The Core's ability to provide cost-effective, consistent, and timely quantitative image response assessment is made possible through new web-based tools. Recent changes include: 1) recruitment of an experienced new Co- Leader, Dr. David Mankoff; 2) expanded and more highly automated services for imaging response assessment and support for advanced imaging methods; 3) expanded capabilities in PET and molecular imaging, and 4) recruitment of seasoned Core staff with experience in cancer imaging core administration and imaging-related regulatory matters. Through its support of both standard imaging in cancer clinical trials and advanced imaging for ACC clinical trials, the Core is poised to lead the ACC into the next generation of clinical and translational research studies guided by quantitative cancer imaging. The current yearly rate of imaging response assessment is over 800 studies per year, involving 57 trials, of which 46 were initiated in the current year. A total of 120 new protocols and 31 different investigators, all of whom are ACC members, used the Core in the reporting period (10/01/13-9/30/14).

"9549495","This project represents is a continuation of series of collaborative studies performed to better characterize and understand immune deficiency. Mutations involving the genes for the common gamma chain (X-SCID) and Fas (ALPS) are being evaluated using Sanger sequencing of genomic DNA with fluorescent probes. These studies have continued to identify a number of new mutations in both diseases and these data have been entered into the NIH NHGRI web site supporting each of these two disorders.  This was followed by the inclusion of mutation analysis of patients with hyper IgM syndrome directed at the genes encoding CD40L and NEMO followed by sequencing for immune deficiency associated mutations focused on host defense defects with recurrent infections involving opportunisitc intracellular organisms including genes encoding the interferon gamma receptor 1 and 2, the IL-12P40 and IL-12 receptor beta 1 genes. Finally, new additional genes have been added to the repertoire including genes encoding: AIRE, ARTEMIS, BTK, FOXP3, ICOS, IL-7Ralpha, JAK3, mu heavy chain,SAP, WASp. This initial work is now complemented by NextGen sequencing using the Ion Torrent PGM platform focused on expanding number of genes evaluated associated with primary immunodeficiencies that currently is focused on 172 known or possible primary immunodeficiency genes to screen patients refered to the NIH and on clinical research protocols with suspected primary immunodeficiency disorders. THis approach to gene mutation screeningd depends on emulsion PCR platform (Haloplex system) that has been validated in house. This togetehr with the choice of the appropriate library has been validated using deidentified patient gDNA samples with previously defined mutations linked to primary immunodeficiency disorders. To date we have identified at least a number of new genes associated with a previously uncharacterized primary immunodeficiency that have been confirmed by Sanger sequencing and functional testing. We continue to evaluate additional samples and will be moving to a more robust platform using the same principle but potentially allowing whole exome sequencing as well as targeted gene sequencing. We are in the process of preparing for publication our overall experience with the targeted gene approach (using the Ion Torrent and Haloplex technology) in screening a substantial number of patient samples. Our expereince to date suggests that this is a cost effective approach for screening referred patients with clear evidence of defects in host defense and that resequencing using the standard Sanger method under defined circumstances may not be necessary."
"9557286","This study received CNS IRB Blue approval on March 17, 2010. The study team is fully staffed and we are actively recruiting patients for this protocol.   In July 2011 we received IRB approval for a sub study that broadens the study inclusion criteria up to 5 years since injury. The sub-study will focus on collecting primarily the TBI Common Data Elements (CDEs), bloods, and imagining.   In June 2012 the IRB approved expanding our enrollment age range from 18-70, to 18 and older. This same amendment exchanged PET-CT for PET-MRI in the imaging section of the protocol. A section regarding offered treatment was added to address the needs of those subjects who have functional needs with limited access to community resources.   At the end of 2014 approval to collect ultra-high field (7 Tesla) imaging parameters was granted by the IRB and the NMR Center allotted time monthly. The 7T magnet has been used to scan both blast and non-blast TBI patients in order to determine if differences between the types of injury can be detected at ultra-high field.  In September 2015 the IRB approved expanding our study population with the addition of a healthy volunteer control group. Additionally, we have noted that the local TBI patient population is not normally distributed and has a somewhat higher level of education than average. Although normative data to which results are compared is demographically adjusted, direct comparisons to a control group from the same population will add support to our findings. In earlier versions of the protocol the need for a control group was discussed. However, the decision to hold off on a control group was made until the demographics of the local TBI population was known and healthy controls could be matched to the patient population.  Including a control group of healthy volunteers to the data set provides direct comparisons to be made with a normal local sample. Therefore, collecting imaging data on a control group on the identical scanner concurrently with the patient population would provide substantial influence to this research. Collecting the same clinical correlates on a local healthy volunteer sample population, as done in the TBI population, will address this critical need when assessing novel diagnostic imaging and biomarkers techniques. In the case of this study, this control population may need to be matched for a variety of patient demographics as well as any co-morbid illnesses that might affect our imaging or serum results.   Additional SLP measures assessing language, discourse, and social cognition have been added to the protocol. Discourse measures will include audio and/or video recording. The discourse analysis is an assessment of language and nonverbal behaviors during procedural, narrative, conversational, and other discourse tasks. Healthy Volunteers are paired with TBI patients of similar age and matching gender, to compare discourse measures between individuals with and without a TBI.   To date, this study has enrolled 175 TBI patients, approximately 60% of which are enrolled in the prospective cohort study and followed longitudinally, and 12 Healthy Volunteers. Previous recruitment challenges have been addressed with the expansion of a formulized recruitment effort and the opening of communication between the Recruitment Core and the Acute TBI Protocol under Dr. Larry Latour."
"9446051","Project Summary This proposal is significant because we aim to develop novel treatments for secondary lymphedema, a common and morbid complication of cancer treatment. This is important because current therapies for this disease are palliative and inadequate. In our previous studies, we have shown that the pathology of lymphedema is secondary to progressive fibrosis and is mediated by chronic T-helper (CD4+) cell inflammation and T-helper 2 (Th2) differentiation. We have used this information to develop novel therapies for the treatment of secondary lymphedema and have recently translated our work from the bench to the bedside in an investigator-initiated trial using Th2 cytokine neutralizing antibodies.  The objective of this application is to identify the cellular mechanisms that initiate CD4+ cell inflammatory responses following lymphatic injury. This objective is a logical extension of our previous work and should identify additional targets that can be targeted pharmacologically to treat/prevent lymphedema. Our long-term objective is to use the information we gain from this basic understanding of lymphedema to develop therapies that disrupt the cycle of events that promote progressive fibrosis and lymphatic dysfunction. Our approach is innovative since we use a combination of mouse models and clinical specimens to dissect the cellular mechanisms of lymphedema pathology. Our group is uniquely positioned to accomplish our goals on the basis of our multidisciplinary team, our access to clinical tissues, and our novel mouse models. We plan to achieve our objectives using 2 specific aims: Aim 1. Determine how lymphatic injury activates CD4+ cells. This aim will use clinical samples and mouse models to test the hypothesis that keratinocytes play a key role in the activation and migration of CD4+ cells to lymphedematous tissues. In addition, we will test the hypothesis that single nucleotide polymorphisms in immune response genes will increase the risk of lymphedema. Aim 3. Determine how inflammation impairs lymphatic function. This aim will test the hypothesis that inflammatory responses in lymphedema impair lymphatic function by multiple effects, including tissue and lymphatic fibrosis, perilymphatic inflammation, and impaired formation of collateral lymphatic vessels."

"9471598","Project Summary Pathological autoimmunity occurs when the immune system attacks healthy tissue, causing immunopathology and tissue dysfunction. There are over 80 recognized autoimmune diseases that afflict 25-50 million Americans, and this represents a significant financial and public health burden. The experimental mouse has been a standard model of autoimmune research for several decades. However, although research in mice has led to most of the fundamental insights into the development and function of the mammalian immune system, restoration of self-tolerance has been relatively easy to achieve in mouse models of autoimmune disease and many of these findings have been difficult to translate into effective therapies for human autoimmunity. This is likely due to 1) Fundamental differences in immune pathways responsible for tolerance induction in mouse vs. human, and 2) Differences in the immune environment between carefully housed and monitored experimental mice and the more heterogeneous and daunting immune challenges faced by humans, who are exposed to continual acute and chronic infection along with an array of environmental exposures that can damage tissues and provoke immune reactions. This highlights the need to study immune tolerance in animal models that more closely resemble human immune systems, and account for each of these important factors. The goal of this proposal is to use novel and realistic mouse models that more closely mirror human immune function to study tolerance induction via manipulation of the IL-2/TR cells axis, and identify critical parameters that influence the outcome of therapies aimed at preventing or ameliorating autoimmune disease."
"9402600","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Introduction - nanoMAG LLC, an engineered biomaterials manufacturer, is developing and commercializing next generation, magnesium (Mg) biocompatible materials with applications in craniofacial and orthopaedic medicine. The overall goal of this SBIR Fast Track project is to develop a bioabsorbable Mg implant for mechanical fixation in craniofacial surgical procedures. This will include confirming function and biocompability, followed by large animal studies required both by FDA and OEM device manufacturers to advance the commercialization of these devices. Significance - Commercial bioabsorbable polymer alloys exist; but they are not strong enough for load bearing and rigid fixation applications (they are FDA approved for only non-load bearing applications). Non- bioabsorbable titanium (Ti) and stainless steel are also used in craniofacial procedures; but complications can occur that necessitate a secondary surgery to remove the devices. Surgical removal is advocated in 60% of cases involving young patients (1). Removal of Ti implants can be extremely difficult, threatened by screw- head fracture, nerve damage, infection and bone refracture (1,2,3,4,5,6). There is a critical need for stronger bioabsorbable materials for craniofacial devices. Long Term Goal and Relevance to NIDCR mission - BioMg(R) 250 will enable rigid craniofacial fixations while obviating the pain, cost, stress and infection risk of secondary operations. The Product - nanoMAG's products are bone fixation devices (plates, screws, tubing) produced from bioabsorbable Mg based alloy, BioMg 250, for use in craniofacial devices.  Phase I Hypothesis and Specific Aims - An experimental methodology and protocol for functional evaluation of BioMg 250 can be developed based on a pilot animal study. A mandible fracture model pilot animal study in swine will demonstrate the feasibility of the technology, providing fully documented protocol and procedures developed for General Laboratory Procedure (GLP) animal studies to be carried out in Phase II. Phase II Hypothesis and Specific Aims - GLP Large animal craniofacial implant studies in conjunction with biocompatibility testing will demonstrate the efficacy and safety of bioabsorbable BioMg 250 implants for load bearing devices. Expected outcomes - carefully executed and fully documented pre-clinical large animal studies to support submission of data to FDA regulatory examiners as well as to OEM strategic partners. ."
"9507160","Project Summary/Abstract The evidence for the degree to which indirect effects (i.e. the protection conferred to unvaccinated individuals) of influenza vaccination reduce the risk of infection is lacking. Much of our current knowledge of indirect effects of influenza vaccination comes from ecologic studies comparing communities in which school children were vaccinated to those in which they were not. Subsequently, several randomized clinical trials vaccinated children and then compared the risk in their contacts to the risk in contacts of unvaccinated children. This previous work is generally limited to one year of follow-up and has not used laboratory-confirmed infection, limiting the quality of the evidence and the ability to draw conclusions about different influenza types and subtypes. The objective of this project is to determine the indirect effects of influenza vaccination in households over multiple years. We hypothesize that indirect vaccine effects can manifest in two ways at the household level. First, vaccinated individuals may be protected against community acquired infection thus preventing them from exposing unvaccinated household contacts. Second, unvaccinated household members can be protected through reduction in infectiousness of a vaccinated household index case, and a subsequent reduction in the secondary infection risk among household contacts. Using longitudinally collected data from the Household Influenza Vaccine Effectiveness (HIVE) cohort study we plan to conduct analyses to address the following specific aims: Aim 1) Quantify the indirect and total effects of influenza vaccination in reducing the risk of influenza infection; Aim 2) Estimate the indirect effect of influenza vaccination in reducing the risk of exposure to influenza at the household level; and Aim 3) Estimate the indirect effect of influenza vaccination in reducing the risk of influenza infection in unvaccinated members following introduction of influenza to the household. The expected outcome of the work proposed in these aims is to quantify the protection of unvaccinated individuals by influenza vaccination of household contacts by influenza type/subtype. We further expect to clarify how that protection is conferred, provide clearer evidence for targeting vaccination by age in the event of vaccine shortage, and to estimate the total effect of vaccination in preventing infection. Indirect effects of influenza vaccination are assumed, despite insufficient evidence. Thus, the impact of these findings will be to improve public health messaging by informing vaccine advisory bodies and other decision makers of the total benefits influenza vaccination."
"9449089","Vascular disease increases with advancing age and is the leading cause of death in the elderly population. The most prominent feature of vascular aging with respect to the cardiovascular system is the gradual and progressive stiffening of the vessel wall. Indeed, age-related aortic stiffness can occur in the absence of any cardiovascular risk factors, and antedates the development of systolic hypertension and cardiovascular disease. Thus, the aging process itself is an important risk factor for vascular stiffness. The pathogenesis of age-related vascular stiffening is marked by non-compliance of the vessel wall due to loss or fragmentation of elastin fibers, deposition of non-compliant collagen fibers, endothelial dysfunction, and increased vascular tone. This leads to progressive microvascular dysfunction and the development of systemic hypertension. Signaling pathways, which affect the compliance and contractility of the vessel wall, therefore, may be important contributors to the pathogenesis of vascular aging or stiffening. Because SMCs are the predominant cell type in the vessel wall of conduit arteries that stiffens with age, abnormal SMC function will probably play a central role in mediating the mechanical and morphological properties of vascular aging. Indeed, physiological and pathological studies suggest that SMC phenotype and function are critical determinants of both passive and active biomechanical properties of the vessel wall. Accordingly, we will focus on the role of ROCK in SMC and determine whether SMC ROCKs are necessary and/or sufficient in mediating arterial stiffening, and if so, to determine the relevant mechanisms involved.  Specific aim 1 will investigate the SMC-specific effects of ROCKs on vascular aging. The hypothesis to be tested is that ROCKs are necessary and sufficient in mediating age-related vascular stiffening. For loss- of-function studies, we will generate SMC-specific ROCK1?/? and ROCK2?/? mice (smROCK1?/? and smROCK2?/?) using smSMC-CreERT2 mice and conditional ROCK1/2flox/flox mice. For gain-of-function studies, we will generate SMC-specific caROCK mice using smSMC-CreERT2 mice and conditional caROCKflox/flox mice. In addition, we will determine whether co-morbidities of advancing age in humans such as obesity and/or atherosclerosis can activate SMC ROCK to accelerate the vascular aging.  Specific aim 2 will investigate the role of eEF1A and SRF phosphorylation in mediating the downstream effects of ROCKs on vascular aging. The hypothesis to be tested is that phosphorylation of eEF1A and SRF by ROCK mediates both contractile and non-contractile SMC functions that contribute to vascular aging. Specifically, we will 1) determine whether SMC eEF1A and SRF phosphorylation increases with age, 2) develop phosphor-mutant eEF1A and SRF mice, and 3) determine whether eEF1A and SRF phosphorylation contributes to ROCK-mediated vascular changes that are associated with aortic stiffening."
"9552569","Traditional microbiological work up is slow and sometimes inaccurate, relying on phenotypic culture identification followed by antimicrobial susceptibility testing. Newer technologies, such as matrix assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) and real-time molecular detection (antimicrobial resistance genes microarrays) have advanced the diagnostic capabilities of clinical microbiology laboratories and have created an exciting field for research and development. Given the in-depth and highly accurate (sometimes complex) results that are produced by such platforms, careful detailed analyses are required to better understand the clinical significance of the organisms identified and the resistance mechanisms detected.  During this fiscal year, we performed a large retrospective analysis on the clinical performance of HardyCHROM CRE media for the detection of carbapenemase-producing organisms from surveillance cultures. Data showed a positive predictive value ranging 8-56% depending on the definition carbapenem resistant organisms applied which varies between states and national guidelines. This has a tremendous effect on applied infection control practices and antimicrobial choices in response to a potential clinical infection. We also performed a comparative evaluation of three phenotypic assays for the detection of carbapenemases, as well as a retrospective analysis on the performance and accuracy of MALDI-TOF MS and susceptibility testing directly from positive blood cultures. The latter has provided informative results for clinical microbiology reporting while awaiting standardized testing results. Quality improvement projects have included a prospective comparative evaluation of blood culture volume monitoring methods (weight vs virtual system), comparative analysis of a multiplex gastrointestinal pathogen panel with traditional methods, and a large comparative assessment of product sterility testing systems for novel therapies (traditional USP<71> manual method vs automated Bactec FX system and BacTAlert Dual-T system)."
"9393993","The Pilot and Feasibility grant program at the University of Chicago's NIDDK Digestive Diseases Research Core Center (DDRCC) is designed to provide a mechanism to promote new initiatives in digestive diseases (DD)-related research. The overall objectives of this program are to support investigations which would allow the development of preliminary data sufficient for funding of a research grant by conventional mechanisms (pilot studies) or testing of an innovative hypothesis which might have important implications or yield significant results for digestive diseases-related research (feasibility studies). Both of these broad aims have been pursued in the context of research focused on maintenance of homeostasis and an understanding of the pathobiology that accompanies intestinal inflammation. In the previous renewal (2005-10), 25 P & F projects were awarded, and in the current period (2010-14), 26 were awarded. The return on investment (ROI) over the past 10 years has exceeded 25:1, in comparison to the previous period from 1995-2004 where the ROI was 20:1. The P & F program remains an important vehicle for promoting multidisciplinary collaboration and a strong supportive scientific network for the young investigators funded by this program. Track I (new) investigators are given highest priority, followed by Tract II (non-DD) and Tract III (DD, new direction) investigators. We are requesting continuing support at the level of $110,000 per year. The funds will be combined with the $50,000 per year in supplemental funding committed by the GI section, bringing the total award amount to $160,000 or $30,000-37,500 for each award depending on the number of awards selected by the External Advisory Board. With the increased award size, the P & F awards are far more attractive to potential applicants and substantial enough to improve the odds that they will be successful in obtaining independent federal and extramural funding. A key feature of the program is the multi-disciplinary nature of the submitted proposals, coming from numerous departments, programs, and institutional affiliate within the University of Chicago network including the two of the University of Chicago affiliates, Argonne National Laboratory (ANL) and Marine Biological Laboratory (MBL). This large catchment of investigator talent reflects the overall scientific diversity of the research base of the DDRCC. The P & F program has therefore made a difference for many investigators, fostered collaboration and interaction, pushed the envelope of scholarship and discovery, and is one of the jewels of our DDRCC program."
"9552567","Research:  My research has focused on three primary areas: 1) Pediatric research; 2) Risk/benefit evaluation in research; and 3) Decision making for incapacitated patients.  1. Pediatric research: I have systematically evaluated the existing guidelines for pediatric research, and attempted to describe alternatives where existing requirements do not provide sufficient protection, or have the potential to block appropriate research.    The U.S. regulations evaluate the risks of pediatric research in comparison to the risks of daily life. However, data we collected reveal that this standard has the potential to expose children to excessive risks in some cases. To address this concern, I have developed and defended the charitable participation standard, according to which the risks of pediatric research should be compared to the risks in daily life that are considered appropriate for children in the context of activities designed to benefit others. This standard offers a way to protect children from being exposed to excessive risks.   I conducted the first survey of the views of parents and children regarding non-beneficial pediatric research. This study provides support non-beneficial research, finding that respondents were as willing to have the children participate in research as charitable activities.   The minimal risk standard typically is understood as establishing one risk threshold. However, based on empirical data that teenagers are able to make their own decisions, I argued for two risk thresholds, one for younger children and a somewhat higher one for older children.   With a fellow, I evaluated the regulations for research with wards of the state. This analysis identified several safeguards to better protect these especially vulnerable individuals.   With a colleague, I conducted the first systematic evaluation of the subjects condition requirement which has caused a good deal of confusion. This analysis reveals that the requirement allows the enrollment of groups that to date have been excluded.   A number of commentators argue that it is unethical to expose children to research risks for the benefit of others. This view, which has been supported by U.S. courts, could halt vital attempts to improve pediatric clinical care. In response, I published the first comprehensive justification for non-beneficial pediatric research.  2. Risk/Benefit Evaluation in Clinical Research:  Currently, IRBs evaluate the risks of research using only their intuition. Yet, extensive data reveal that intuitive evaluation is subject to systematic biases. To better protect research subjects, I have been developing a systematic method for evaluating research risks.   Recognizing that the risks of research and daily life are of different types, I developed a method (SERR) for comparing risks of different types. This method led to the first empirical data that IRBs are miscategorizing the risks of pediatric studies.   With a fellow, I further developed SERR to allow IRBs to compare the likelihood and magnitude of the risks of research to the risks of daily life. Since it was published, I have been contacted by two of the largest clinical research groups, Western IRB and Quintiles, who are interested in using the approach.   Most regulations allow vulnerable individuals to be enrolled in riskier research only when the risks are justified by the potential for direct benefit. We conducted an analysis which reveals that existing interpretations of direct benefits are overly narrow and supports an interpretation which has less risk of blocking appropriate research.  3. Decision making for incapacitated individuals: While current emphasis on respecting individual autonomy respects competent adults, it poses a significant dilemma for treating incapacitated adults. My work in this area has focused on evaluating how well reliance on surrogates promotes the goals of decision making and developing improved methods.   In a prior systematic review, we showed that surrogates are not able to promote the goal of providing treatment consistent with patient preferences. In response, I described and defended a new approach, the Patient Preference Predictor, which predicts which treatments a given patient would want based on the preferences of similar individuals,    We just completed one of the largest surveys ever conducted on surrogate decision making. This survey of almost 1200 patients was the first ever to gather systematic data on patients own priorities regarding the goals for surrogate decision making. It also will provide empirical data on patients attitudes regarding the Patient Preference Predictor.   Many argue that reliance on surrogates promotes the goal of helping the family. To evaluate this claim, a fellow and I completed the first systematic review of the impact of making treatment decisions for incapacitated patients. This review found that making these decisions poses a significant burden on many surrogates. These data underscore the need to consider new methods to make these decisions."
"9555575","Clonal mast cell disorders are known to occur in a subset of patients with systemic reactions to Hymenoptera stings. This observation has prompted the question of whether clonal mast cell disorders also occur in patients with idiopathic anaphylaxis (IA).  In collaboration with Dr. Metcalfe group, we sought to determine the prevalence of clonal mast cell disorders among patients with IA, criteria to identify those patients who require a bone marrow biopsy, and whether the pathogenesis of IA involves a hyperresponsive mast cell compartment. We analyzed prospectively enrolled patients with IA (3 episodes/y) who then underwent a medical evaluation that included a serum tryptase determination, allele-specific quantitative PCR (ASqPCR) for the KIT D816V mutation, and a bone marrow examination. Mast cells were cultured from peripheral blood CD34+ cells and examined for releasability after FcRI aggregation. Results showed that clonal mast cell disease was diagnosed in 14% of patients referred with IA. ASqPCR for the KIT D816V mutation was a useful adjunct in helping identify those with systemic mastocytosi, but not monoclonal mast cell activation syndrome. A modified overall clonal prediction model was developed by using clinical findings, a serum tryptase determination, and ASqPCR. There was no evidence of a hyperresponsive mast cell phenotype in patients with IA. We concluded that patients with clonal mast cell disease can present as having IA. Distinct clinical and laboratory features can be used to select those patients more likely to have an underlying clonal mast cell disorder (monoclonal mast cell activation syndrome or systemic mastocytosis) and thus candidates for a bone marrow biopsy."
"9607139","PROJECT SUMMARY (See instructions):  Molecular-based imaging provides unique opportunities to assess the pharmacokinetics and targeting properties of r potential therapeutic agents, as well as to assess vital cellular processes in vivo. The ability to monitor the molecular processes of cancer through non-invasive imaging may provide critical information regarding the effects of therapy. In the context of pre-clinical research, the use of in vivo imaging permits the acquisition of a complete dynamic biodistribution study of a molecular tracer on an single animal, thereby reducing the number of animals required to reach a statistically adequate result. Often the imaging techniques and targeting agents that are tested in small animal imaging modalities are directly transferable to the clinical setting. The Small Animal Imaging Core (SAIC) is a shared resource dedicated to providing investigators access to state of the art small animal imaging capabilities for use in basic and translational research relevant to the mission of the City of Hope Cancer Center. Specific aims of the SAIC include: (1) keeping abreast of the latest developments, current capabilities, and limitations of small animal imaging as pertains to cancer research; (2) implementing, developing, calibrating, maintaining, and operating relevant imaging systems within the context of a small animal imaging laboratory; and (3) optimizing the use of small animal imaging in research at City of Hope in collaboration with investigators. Core personnel currently include a Director, an imaging physicist, and a manager, all of whom are highly experienced in the use of imaging for research with animals. Small animal imaging systems in operation include two units for bioluminescence optical imaging (one has been modified for fluorescence imaging [IVIS 100, Caliper Life Sciences]); a gamma camera (y- IMAGER, Biospace, Inc.); a PET scanner (microPET R4, Siemens); and a CT scanner (microCAT II Hi Res, Siemens). The microPET and microCAT are readily used in tandem to generate co-registered functional anatomic PET/CT images. The Animal Resources Center has provided three rooms within the Parvin Biomedical Research Building for use by the SAIC (one room for the microPET, microCAT, and the y- IMAGER, and two rooms for the IVIS optical imaging instruments. A system has been developed for monitoring instrument usage and to bill users for a portion of the costs of the imaging procedures."
"9444209","More than 1.2 million new cases of non-melanoma skin cancer, including squamous cell carcinoma and basal cell carcinoma, are diagnosed annually in the United States, and the lifetime risk for skin cancer exceeds the lifetime risk for all other cancers combined. Ultraviolet (UV) radiation is considered as the main cause of non-melanoma skin cancer. The current paradigm for prevention against UVB-induced skin cancer is application of general antioxidant products, which is inadequate because it is based on incomplete understanding of the role of oxidative stress in cancer development. The overall goal of this research is to gain an in-depth understanding of the mechanism by which superoxide radical/anion (O2·- ) in mitochondria contributes to metabolic switch during UVB carcinogenesis and to test the concept that a targeted antioxidant approach can prevent skin cancer. Our preliminary data demonstrate that the expression of manganese containing superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) is suppressed in histologically normal skin at preneoplastic stage, which results in increased superoxide production and increased synthesis of uncoupling proteins (UCPs). Furthermore, knockdown of UCPs suppresses lactate production and increases ATP levels. Thus, adaptation to increased superoxide production by induction of UCPs is likely the critical step leading to the Warburg effect. We also have found that exposure to UVB causes nitration and inactivation of MnSOD, and activation of prosurvival autophagy responses. Co-immunoprecipitation of nitrated MnSOD identified members of the Chaperone-Mediated Autophagy (CMA) pathway, which supports the role of CMA in selective degradation of nitrated proteins. Based on these novel findings, we propose that O2·- is a critical driver of metabolic alteration in UVB carcinogenesis that promotes cancer development and progression. Specific Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that O2·- triggers an uncoupling protein (UCP)-dependent metabolic switch. Specific Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that MnSOD is a critically important target of UVB-induced peroxynitrite (OONO- ) that leads to activation of autophagy responses. Specific Aim 3 will test the concept that UVB-induced O2·- and OONO- are critical mediators that promote UV carcinogenesis. We will use molecular genetic approach coupled with proteomics to identify UCP transcriptomes and stable-isotope-resolved metabolomics to identify pathways leading to preneoplastic metabolic alterations. We will use well- characterized mimetics of MnSOD to test the concept that mechanistically targeted antioxidants can prevent UV carcinogenesis. The relationship between UV radiation and energy metabolism remains unknown. The results from this study will close that knowledge gap and will provide valuable insights into the metabolic vulnerabilities that are amenable to cancer prevention."
"9557282","Improved viral screening assays and more intensive questioning of donors for high-risk behaviors have resulted in dramatic declines in the rates of transfusion-transmitted hepatitis and AIDS. Nonetheless, there is need for continued vigilance of the safety of blood supply. This study aims to enroll blood donors and prospectively followed blood recipients in order to establish active surveillance for a multiplicity of potential blood transmitted infectious agents and establish a repository of linked donor and recipient samples so that newly emerging infectious agent can be rapidly evaluated for their threat to the blood supply.    This study has thus far enrolled 1633 patients; 1033 from NIH or Suburban Hospital and 600 from Children's National Medical Center. We have complete serial sampling on 1087 (67%) patients and partial sampling on 178(11.0%) patients. 355(22.%) patients have either died, or were lost to follow up and 13 patients are in active follow up. For the 1265 patients with at least partial sampling, there have been approximately 6300 blood exposures.  There has been no transmission of HCV, HBV, HIV or HTLV observed. There has been one definite transfusion-related transmission of parvovirus-B-19. Using unlinked donor samples we have  found the prevalence of antibody to EBV to be 88% for anti-EBVCA IgG, 47% for anti-EBVNA and 0% for anti-EBVCA IgM; the prevalence of anti-CMV IgG is 44% and is 2% for anti-CMV IgM. We have tested 500 donors for anti-HHV-8 against two HHV-8 epitopes. The average seroprevalence of anti-HHV-8 is approximately 15%. Using an unlicensed but well-validated EIA, the prevalence of antibody to the hepatitis E virus was 21.8% in 916 donor samples obtained in 2006, but fell to 16% in 1023 donor samples obtained in 2012. Only 0.4% of samples were positive for IgM anti-HEV in both time periods and none of the antibody positive samples were HEV RNA positive. In a prospective follow-up of 362 blood recipients, no HEV transmissions have been observed.    We continue to investigate the transfusion risk of CMV, HHV-8, HBV, HCV and HIV by molecular techniques. We found that 47(4.7%)of 1000 recipients tested HHV-8 DNA positive in their post-transfusion sample,but most were also positive in their pretransfusion sample; hence there were only 6(0.6%)molecular conversions and based on pre-transfusion serology, only one possible new HHV-8 infection that could not be confirmed subsequently. Similarly, there were 34(3.5%) molecular conversions for CMV DNA, but based on the presence of pre-transfusion antibody, all of these appeared to be CMV reactivations rather than new infections. Among 924 recipeints analyzed for parvo-virus B-19, there was one molecular conversion (0.1%)that represented one transfusion transmitted infection proven by phylogenetic analysis of the virus in both donor and recipient. This represents one of only four other documented cases of B19 virus transmission by single-donor blood components and the case was published in the journal Transfusion.  Thus far, the proportion of patients that develop new infections post-transfusion is small although reacttivation of CMV infection is relatively common. Also, even a single observed case, as for Parvo B-19, when extrapolated to the 15 million blood products transfused per year in the U.S., potentially represents thousands of transmissions nationwide. As expected, there were no identified transmissions of HBV, HCV or HIV. In light of epidemics of dengue, zika virus and chikungunya virus in South America and the Caribbean, we have begun a surveillance of blood donors who travelled to these areas and will closely follow any that test positive for these agents. We are also developing methods to test for all three agents simultaneously. We are in the process of developing a gene chip that we detect up to 20 transfusion transmitted agents simultaneously. This chip technology will be used in real time for monitoring recipients in the TRIPS study and ultimately may be used to screen blood donors.       We have completed a study assessing the transfusion risk of the hepatitis E virus (HEV). This agent, previously  thought to cause only acute resolving hepatitis and  to be rare in industrialized countries, has now been shown to sometimes result in chronic liver disease and isolated cases of blood transmission have been reported in industrialized nations. Our testing of blood transfusion recipients revealed 2/362 (0.06%) possible antibody seroconversions.  Neither recipient was found  to be HEV RNA positive at any time point in the study.  Further investigation of linked donor samples, found that in one case, antibody positivity was caused by passive transfer of IgG from a donated unit with high titer anti-HEV. Overall, this study did not find any cases of transfusion-transmitted HEV infection despite the high prevalence of anti-HEV antibody in the donor population. These findings were  published in the journal Transfusion in October, 2013. We have completed our study of transfusion-associated microchimerism (TA-MC) in this TRIPS cohort and have now tested 431 adult and pediatric female blood product recipients for persistence of donor leukocytes as determine by detection of Y chromosome. We evaluated persistence of TA-MC in a non-trauma setting where all blood is leukoreduced and at least half the blood is irradiated.  Of the 431 recipients tested, 14.3% (12/84;5 adults and 7 children), demonstrated very low-level, but reproducible MC.  However, development of persistent high-level MC was not demonstrated in any of 431 adult and pediatric blood recipients.  The risk of TA-MC appears dependent on the clinical setting, being rare in routine transfusion and high in patients sustaining severe trauma.  The preliminary data was presented at the 2010 annual meeting of the American Association of Blood Banks (AABB) and was published in the journal Transfusion, October 2011.    In addition, we collaborated with Dr. Philip J. Norris from Blood Systems Research Institute (BSRI) in San Francisco, California to evaluate human leukocyte antigen (HLA) alloimmunization in recipients of leukoreduced (LR) and non-leukoreduced (non-LR) blood using newer, more sensitive antibody detection assays.  Pre-transfusion and serial post-transfusion (4, 8, 12, & 24 wk) samples from 20 TRIPS recipients of LR blood were tested and compared to 29 recipients of non-LR blood provided by the Transfusion-Transmitted Viruses Study (TTVS).  A substantial proportion of subjects possessed pre-transfusion HLA Abs in both cohorts studied (20 of 29 in TTVS, 8 of 20 in TRIPS).  Applying a sensitive HLA Ab test revealed high levels of baseline alloimmunization in the TTVS and TRIPS cohorts and frequent alloimmunization even in recipients of LR blood.  An abstract detailing the results from this study was presented at the 2010 annual meeting of the AABB and a manuscript has been published in the journal Transfusion, June 2013."

"9562826","The first step performed to achieve the goals stated above was to assess the technical capabilities of a commercially available stereophotogrammetry (SP) system. We performed a study to determine the reliability, stability, validity and precision of a SP system for use in quantifying the complex three-dimensional (3D) structure of the human torso. We performed assessments of the system using images of geometric solids and a human-form mannequin. Analysis of geometric solids revealed excellent intra- and inter-rater reliability of the system for linear, surface area and volume measurements (r > 0.99, P < 0.001). Overall, no significant difference was found between SP and manual measurements (F = 4.23, P > 0.06). The system exhibited excellent stability in images of the mannequin over time (r > 0.99). The limit of precision (error > 5%) of the system to detect objects on the surface of the mannequin was estimated at an object size of 23.5cm2 for surface area and 32mL for volume. After confirming the stability of the SP image acquisition system with human-form mannequin, a human subjects protocol was approved by the NIDCR IRB. A materials transfer agreement with the University of Alberta, Canada was completed in order to share MatLab image analysis software developed by investigators there  In this first phase of the clinical study, 102 healthy volunteers were imaged using the SP system, and these images were processed into transverse torso slices between 2.5 and 6 mm using the Matlab image analysis software. The coefficients of variation were calculated for each thickness for desired outcome measures such as pseudocobb angle or maximum difference in area between the right and left half of the torso. Preliminary analyses of data obtained in this phase of the study were presented in March 2013 at the Annual Meeting of the Association of Academic Physiatrists. It was found that all outcome measures had coefficients of variation that were at or below the 30% threshold for stability, with the exception of the pseudoCobb measure. Modifications in the pseudocobb analysis algorithm have recently been completed and have yielded more reliable results.  The findings above indicate that this SP system does have the potential to provide quantifiable, multi-planar information about spinal and chest wall deformities. A report of the results of this phase is currently in preparation for publication.  The phase one results have allowed us to move on to our second phase of the study and we are continuing to accrue subjects with scoliosis and/or rib deformities in order to assess the ability of the system to discriminate healthy subjects from those with scoliosis, and chest wall deformity. We have also begun testing the system's sensitivity to detect changes in deformity over time. Subsequent to this accrual and analysis, the information gained will be applied to accrual and development of analyses of the distribution of adiposity in persons with truncal obesity."

"9552571","The application of next-generation sequencing (NGS) approaches to infectious disease diagnostics is anticipated to result in substantial clinical advances. In particular, techniques based on unbiased shotgun sequencing and targeted amplicon sequencing of DNA and RNA extracted from primary specimens are expected to have many advantages over classical microbiological approaches, including the detection of pathogens directly from primary specimens that may be difficult or impossible to culture.  Nevertheless, routine application of this technique for diagnostic use is still challenging due to complicated requirements for sample preparation, the considerable expertise required for data analysis and interpretation, and the lack of off-the-shelf commercial solutions. This works aims to implement and validate an integrated NGS-based diagnostic system in a routine hospital microbiology service.  Development of this system requires choosing and optimizing appropriate DNA extraction and library preparation methods for both ubiased and targeted amplicon sequencing approaches, assembly of a local computer and network infrastructure to support in-lab processing of data, implementation and validation of bioinformatics pipelines for data analysis, and clinical reporting.   One exploratory aspect of this work is to determine the complexity of NGS pipeline output from clinical specimens, which has not been well characterized. The complexity of data obtained, in turn, will be used to guide the design of an interpretive framework for converting pipeline output into a form suitable for clinical reporting.  In the current fiscal year, we have developed SOPs for nucleic acid extraction and NGS library preparation from primary clinical specimens, designed and implemented in-lab computer and network infrastructure resources capable of manipulating and analyzing NGS data, and installed and debugged software pipelines for NGS data analysis.   Clinical validation of a highly sensitive 16S rDNA NGS method for universal bacterial identification was completed in the past year. More than 500 samples representing various spiked and clinical pathogen compositions, clinical specimen matrices, and replicates were sequenced and analyzed in the course of development. Work is presently underway to develop and validate an ITS NGS method for universal fungal identification in clinical specimens.    In addition, we have estimated limits of detection using a metric that relates DNA concentrations, read counts and CFU counts.  Initial validation results suggest that an NGS-based approach can offer superb sensitivity and specificity when variables are properly optimized."

"9386058","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cell death facilitates the removal of infected cells; it can be triggered by many stimuli, which activate numerous biochemical pathways that lead to apoptotic (immunologically silent), as well as non-apoptotic (including pyroptosis or Caspase-1-dependent, and necroptosis or RIPK3/MLKL-dependent) forms of death (1) (Figure 1). Recently we revealed a new role for pyroptosis in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPC) during hematopoietic stress induced by viral infection and chemotherapy causing cytopenia, immunosuppression and bone marrow failure (2). We now present preliminary data, currently in press at Cell, that RIPK3-dependent necroptotic cell death limits the self-renewal capacity of LT-HSC in lethally-irradiated recipient mice (Figure 2). This result unveils non-apoptotic cell death as a key biological process restricting HSC self-renewal, and has major clinical implications for improving the engraftment potential of HSC in transplantation settings using bone marrow, G-CSF-mobilized peripheral blood stem cells, cord blood units, and for gene therapy clinical trials. These data will change our view of one of the cornerstones of HSC biology: the self-renewal of HSC and how necroptosis impacts lifelong hematopoiesis and immunity. Our extensive preliminary data also establishes RIPK1 as a negative regulator of RIPK3/MLKL-dependent necroptosis. To access necroptotic cell death pathways, most previous studies utilize caspase inhibitors to block Caspase-8-mediated inhibition of RIPK3. Here we can now investigate necroptosis without treating primary cells or mice with caspase inhibitors, heralding a new approach to understanding necroptosis and the possible interaction of this non-apoptotic cell death pathway with executioner caspases such as caspase-3. This application seeks to use these necroptotic Ripk1-/- chimeric mice to specifically investigate the physiological consequences of necroptosis and its negative regulation by RIPK1 in hematopoieisis. We will investigate the following specific aims to understand how necroptosis affects HSPC: Aim 1. Define the role of RIPK1 and MLKL in the self-renewal of HSC and recovery from chemotherapy. Aim 2. Biochemical, morphological, and kinetic analysis of necroptosis ex vivo. Aim 3. Study the role of RIPK1 and MLKL in viral-infected HSPC."
"9575529","The overarching goal of this program is to define cellular and molecular events during neural development vulnerable to genetic perturbations that increase risk for neurodevelopmental and neurological disorders. Currently, our knowledge of human brain development is largely inferred from animal models, indirect measures of human development, and limited access to human neural tissue. All of these are valid tools to piece together the sequential processes of human neural development but are not sufficient to describe the dynamics with enough temporal or molecular resolution to understand mechanistically how genetic risk factors can affect brain formation and function. Technological advances in cellular reprogramming have now made it possible to derive induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from adult patients, which are a renewable resource for the generation of human neurons with disease-relevant genetic features. This long-term research program is designed to incorporate human iPSC-based studies with animal models to provide a comprehensive and longitudinal understanding of neural development, from neural stem cell behavior to neuronal development, synapse formation and circuit integration. As a proof-of-principle, these studies will use a prominent copy number variation (CNV) risk factor for multiple neurological disorders, 15q11.2CNVs, to illustrate how multifaceted interrogations of the basic biology of neural development in the context of genetic variation can reveal new targets for testing mechanism-based intervention in relevant subtypes of human neurons, as well as animal models of neural function and behavior. Building on significant scientific discoveries we have made in the fields of stem cell biology, adult neurogenesis, and patient-specific iPSCs, and technological innovations we have developed to meet critical challenges in each of these fields, our primary research focus is to integrate multiple levels of analysis to provide a high-resolution description of the cellular processes and molecular mechanisms of neural development that can be used to probe genetic or environmental risk for neurological disorders. Three interlinked projects will be pursued. Project 1 will focus on adult mouse neurogenesis as a model for neural development and use clonal analysis of neural stem cells and their development, single-cell transcriptome analysis, and transgenic mouse models to dissect molecular, cellular, and circuit level effects of genetic mutations on neural development; Project 2 will use human iPSCs with known genetic risk factors, and targeted differentiation protocols, to interrogate human neural development in 2D and 3D cultures; and Project 3 will focus on identifying the molecular mechanisms and targets of risk genes in both animal models and human iPSC-derived neurons and the rescue of observed deficits through rational therapeutic intervention. This is an opportune moment to synthesize recently developed technologies and build a novel translational platform to study underlying mechanisms of neurological disorders, and facilitate the identification of strategies to diagnose, treat, and prevent the often debilitating consequences of dysregulated neural development."
"9465849","PROJECT SUMMARY Bloodstream infections (BSIs) represent a very serious clinical manifestation that can be caused by a variety of bacterial and fungal pathogens, many of which have been associated with high rates of mortality. Physicians caring for patients with BSIs are challenged with having very limited time to make an effective diagnosis, including identification of the causative agent and determination of the antimicrobial susceptibility profile of that pathogen, prompting the use of empiric treatment regimens that routinely consist of multiple broad-spectrum antibiotics. Since a comprehensive diagnosis typically takes several days to complete, many patients receive antibiotics either unnecessarily or incorrectly, due to the lack of infection or infection with an antibiotic-resistant pathogen, respectively. Although currently unavoidable based on the diagnostic tools available, these therapeutic decisions can have severely detrimental implications on patient health, including the generation of antibiotic resistant organisms and the destruction of normal bacterial flora, the latter of which can give rise to additional downstream infections with pathogens such as Clostridium difficile. With these consequences in mind, it is clear that new and improved processes that expedite the detection of BSI-causing pathogens are vital to reducing patient mortality rates and enabling more effective antibiotic stewardship practices. The proposed studies focus on developing a rapid and efficient method to detect BSIs directly from human whole blood, effectively replacing standard blood culturing devices which can have extensive times-to-result. We will evaluate commercially available blood separation devices for their sample processing effectiveness for subsequent analysis in the BacterioScan 216Dx, a highly sensitive laser light-scattering device that has a ~3-log lower limit of detection (LOD) than instruments currently used in clinical microbiology laboratories. Once established, we will use this process to determine the limit of detection and time-to- positivity for a broad panel of common BSI-causing pathogens, comparing the 216Dx?s detection performance to that of a conventional blood culturing device. Based on preliminary data, we anticipate significant improvements in times required to flag samples as positive, without significant increases in pathogen LOD relative to currently-utilized methods. Likewise, we envision a reduced time to definitively identify uninfected specimens, promoting the justified de-escalation of unnecessary antimicrobial treatment. Taken together, particularly when considering the potentially dire clinical implications of BSIs, successful execution of this proposal will empower clinicians to make faster and more informed therapy decisions which, in turn, will impact both patient care and the more prudent use of antimicrobial agents."
"9597602","  PROJECT SUMMARY Epidemiological, genetic, and biological evidence implicates mitochondrial dysfunction in the pathogenesis of Parkinson Disease (PD). Recent transcriptional studies have identified clusters of genes reduced in dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra of patients with subclinical and symptomatic PD, the majority of which are involved in neuronal metabolism and mitochondrial function. These findings raise the possibility that the function of transcriptional regulators of metabolic and mitochondrial genes may be compromised in idiopathic PD and that targeting key transcriptional pathways for gene regulation may be an appropriate strategy for preventing and/or rescuing metabolic deficits and neuronal cell death.  Using bioinformatics and transcriptional assays, we have identified a potential transcription factor required for the regulation of metabolic and nuclear-encoded gene transcription in dopaminergic nigral neurons. This protein, estrogen-related receptor ? (ERR?), drives the expression of nuclear-encoded genes for mitochondrial biogenesis and respiration in peripheral tissues, and it can directly associate with peroxisome proliferator- activated receptor ? coactivator 1? (PGC-1?), a transcriptional coactivator that is reduced in PD and can be neuroprotective when overexpressed in PD models. Our preliminary data indicate that ERR? is expressed by neurons of the substantia nigra in rodents and that deletion of ERR? from the mouse midbrain causes a reduction in ERR?-driven metabolic genes and motor activity. Furthermore, our data indicate that PGC-1?- target genes are enriched in binding sites for ERR? and that PGC-1? and ERR? can synergistically drive mitochondrial gene expression. Importantly, the majority of mitochondrial genes of the electron transport chain reduced in PD are ERR? target genes. The experiments proposed in this application will expand upon these initial findings to test the hypotheses that ERR? is a central regulator of metabolic and mitochondrial gene expression in nigral neurons (Aim 1), that ERR? is required for PGC-1? to induce metabolic and mitochondrial genes (Aim 2), and that overexpression of ERR? can prevent cell dysfunction and death in rodent model of PD (Aim 3). These experiments have the potential to reveal the critical pathways by which nigral neurons maintain metabolic and mitochondrial homeostasis and a novel avenue for improving mitochondrial function in disease. Furthermore, considering that ERR? can orchestrate a transcriptional program for a number of genes reduced in PD, ERR? deletion in nigral neurons could serve as a biologically relevant model of idiopathic PD.  "
"9481669","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Oral antiretroviral therapy (ART) is highly effective for HIV-infected people to prevent transmission and HIV- uninfected people to prevent acquisition, known as pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), but monitoring and improving drug adherence have been challenging. The World Health Organization recommends all HIV-infected people receive ART and all people at substantial risk of HIV infection receive PrEP with priority for high incidence groups (?3 infections/100 person-years) in both the US and developing countries. However, ART and PrEP are only effective when people maintain drug levels equivalent to ?4 doses per week. As many patients taking ART or PrEP have difficulty with adherence, clinicians currently have no available tools to monitor drug levels or adherence to provide targeted counseling and support. We propose that a simple, rapid, point-of-care assay to monitor ART or PrEP drug adherence could be a useful tool for clinicians and patients to monitor drug levels and guide adherence counseling, which may lead to less HIV transmission and better coordination of HIV prevention efforts. Since 2013, we have been developing a simple, point-of-care assay to accurately and inexpensively measure tenofovir, the primary drug of both ART and PrEP. In 2016, we initiated an NIH-funded pharmacokinetic study to establish the necessary limit of detection and drug levels for our point-of-care PrEP adherence test. Therefore, we will complete the development of the rapid tenofovir test, transfer the technology to a lateral flow point-of-care assay format with the appropriate detection threshold, and conduct a clinical feasibility, acceptability and validation study in a local PrEP clinic. Our objective in this application is to complete the development of a rapid lateral flow point-of-care test to monitor and improve adherence to ART and PrEP, and to assess feasibility, acceptability, and validation in a PrEP clinic. We plan to test our central hypotheses by pursuing the following three specific aims: (1) To optimize the detection and measurement of tenofovir in buffer, blood, and urine specimens using antibodies, aptamers, or nanobodies; (2) To transfer the immunoassay components into a lateral flow assay format and establish the quantitative range and limit of detection of tenofovir in blood and urine specimens; (3) To assess clinical feasibility and validation of the point-of-care tenofovir test among PrEP providers and patients in a clinical setting. This work is innovative because it develops an entirely new category of rapid diagnostic test for monitoring adherence, which will help patients and clinicians improve ART and PrEP adherence and prevent HIV transmission. At the end of this project, we expect to have a rapid lateral flow assay that will be suitable for a future large-scale clinical implementation trial. If our rapid tenofovir adherence test proves to be valuable and cost-effective, then it could be easily implemented in clinics worldwide, including resource-limited settings."
"9569189","The goal of this project is to explore the possibility of designing public policies aimed at improving the health of low-income populations. Toward this end, this project has engaged health policy experts and low-income residents in an exploratory exercise aimed at designing an affordable, evidence-based intervention program targeted at addressing socio-economic factors and reducing health disparities among low income urban residents. A three step process is entailed:   1. Identification of candidate interventions that have been shown to ameliorate the socio-economic determinants of health, and estimation of the actuarial costs of offering these services to low income residents of Washington, D.C.;  2. Consideration of a reasonable per capita expenditure for the purpose;  3. Engagement of low-income residents of Washington, D.C.to ascertain their priorities for publicly funding the proposed interventions within the assigned budget.    Several hundred low-income adults recruited from clinical and community settings have participated in this engagement process through 43 small group exercises in which a facilitated discussion takes place using a previously tested group decision tool, REACH (Reaching Economic Alternatives that Contribute to Health). Data pertaining to participants socio-demographic characteristics, attitudes toward health, and preferences for possible interventions have been collected anonymously. Group discussions have been audio-taped. Data have been analyzed quantitatively and qualitatively to determine preferences for various interventions and their association with socio-demographic characteristics. Participants have been financially compensated for their participation in this study which has been approved by IRBs at the NIH, Howard University and the District of Columbia Department of Heatlh.   Study results have yielded information about the interventions that are of utmost priority to low income urban residents in Washington, D.C. This is unique information that may contribute to efforts to find affordable strategies for ameliorating the socio-economic determinants of health for low-income urban population in the US.  Three manuscript have been published. In 2013-14 the REACH exercise developed for this project was adapted for use in engaging residents in Birmingham, United Kingdom."
"9405328","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The piRNA pathway has a conserved role in transposon silencing and genome maintenance during germline development. Adaptation to new genome pathogens by the Drosophila piRNA genome defense system appears to be driven by transposition into heterochromatic clusters, which produce the primary piRNAs that to initiate silencing. The HP1 homolog Rhino binds to clusters and is evolving rapidly under positive selection, suggesting that it may co-evolve with invading mobile elements. piRNA clusters and Rhino thus function at the adaptive interface between the piRNA pathway and transposons. Aims1 and 2 combine evolutionary divergence and conservation with genetic, genomic, computational and cytological tools to define this critical interface. The ability to differentiate cluster transcripts from mRNAs is critical to the specificity of the piRNA dense system, and our recent data suggest that stalled spicing may mark cluster transcripts for processing into silencing RNAs. Aim 3 focuses on the role of splicing in piRNA precursor sorting into the silencing pathway. These studies address mechanisms that maintain the inherited genome and are likely to directly impact reproductive health."
"9448049","Project summary Systemic sclerosis (SSc) is a progressive fibrotic disease for which there is no effective treatment. Presently, the major cause of morbidity and mortality for patients with SSc is respiratory failure due to pulmonary fibrosis. Despite how commonly interstitial lung disease (ILD) occurs in SSc, it remains poorly understood and represents a major unmet medical need. The Wnt/?-catenin (?-cat) signaling pathway is known to be crucial for cell fate decisions throughout development and adult tissue repair after injury. Work from our group and others have shown that the Wnt/?-cat pathway is aberrantly activated in systemic sclerosis and the associated ILD. Subsequent studies from our laboratory provided the first evidence that global genetic loss of the Wnt co-receptor Lrp5, resulting in reduced ?-cat signaling, was protective against bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis and that, in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells from two independent cohorts of Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF) subjects, Wnt signaling as one of the top 2 over- represented pathways associated with worsened prognosis. We have generated extensive preliminary data demonstrating that sustained ?-cat signaling in lung macrophages promotes the persistence of lung fibrosis after both bleomycin- and asbestos-induced injuries in mice, suggesting that macrophages are a key cell type through which ?-cat signaling drives fibrosis. Our preliminary data also reveal that the alveolar macrophage population is increased in SSc-ILD lungs, where lung transcriptomes from SSc-ILD and IPF subjects share common genes. Thus, based on these findings, we reason that the signals that drive macrophage recruitment, differentiation and perdurance after tissue injury are conserved across fibrotic diseases through a common Wnt/?-cat regulatory axis. We hypothesize that Wnt/?-cat signaling is required for the differentiation of monocytes into recruited alveolar macrophages and that injured lung alveolar epithelium provides a contextual Wnt signal that maintains a pro-fibrotic milieu for these recruited macrophages, thus aggravating lung repair and promoting the persistence of fibrosis. We propose 1) to determine the role Wnt/?-cat signaling to the differentiation of monocytes-macrophages in the persistence of fibrosis in SSc-ILD, 2) to determine the contribution of Wnt signaling from the injured alveolar epithelium in maintaining the pro-fibrotic macrophage phenotype in SSc-ILD, and 3) to determine the monocyte- macrophage subpopulations from subjects with SSc-ILD that express enrichment for Wnt pathway genes. We will use human blood and lung samples from subjects with SSc-ILD and complementary in vivo approaches using competitive and shielded chimeric mice, macrophage-specific transgenic mice targeting ?-cat and Wnt ligands, and chemical ablation to dissect the relative contributions of Wnt/?-cat signaling in macrophages and epithelial cells necessary for repair after lung injury and in SSc-ILD where immune pathways are implicated."
"9389531","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) is a clinical syndrome of acute lung injury characterized by a sudden onset and a profound inability of the lungs to oxygenate the blood (hypoxemia). ARDS has a mortality rate of 30% and is responsible for 75,000 deaths annually in the United States despite extensive research efforts. The combination of sepsis plus mechanical ventilation significantly increases the risk for developing ARDS. Therefore, a two-hit model of acute lung injury is of great interest and has been studied extensively in animal models. However, the specific mechanisms underlying the development of acute lung injury through synergy of sepsis and mechanical ventilation (MV) remain unknown. Interleukin 1? (IL-1?) is implicated in the pathogenesis of ARDS, and its secretion is regulated by an intracellular complex termed the NLRP3 inflammasome, which we recently demonstrated is activated in macrophages by mitochondrial dysfunction and is associated with cell death. We developed a mouse model in which MV triggers macrophage mitochondrial dysfunction and cell death, and inhaled lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and MV together lead to IL-1? secretion and the development of acute lung injury, as demonstrated by neutrophil infiltration, alveolar edema, chemokine secretion, and hypoxemia. Interestingly, when IL-1? signaling was disrupted by the absence of caspase-1 or NLRP3, or by the administration of IL-1R antagonist Anakinra, we observed significant improvement in the development of hypoxemia without significant effects on neutrophil infiltration or alveolar leakage, indicating that the mechanism causing hypoxemia in lung injury is independent of lung inflammation but dependent on IL- 1? signaling. These data suggest a novel role for IL-1? and the NLRP3 inflammasome, specifically in the hypoxemia associated with acute lung injury and ARDS. We hypothesize that hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction, in which blood is diverted away from areas of poor gas exchange, can help to explain how the development of hypoxemia can be mechanistically distinct from inflammation. Literature suggests that IL- 1? may modulate hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction by affecting nitric oxide production in the lung. Indeed, we found that MV increases expression of nitric oxide synthase 2 (NOS2) and nitric oxide production in the lung, and that Nos2-deficient mice were protected from the development of acute lung injury-related hypoxemia. Based on these data, the central hypothesis for this mentored K08 grant application is that the development of hypoxemia in acute lung injury requires NLRP3 inflammasome activation and IL-1? secretion, and that the mechanism of hypoxemia is primarily through IL-1? effects on hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction. We now propose to test our hypothesis through the following aims: Aim 1 is to determine the role of alveolar macrophages in the development of hypoxemia in acute lung injury; Aim 2 is to determine the role of nitric oxide in IL-1?-dependent hypoxemia in acute lung injury; and Aim 3 is to determine if NLRP3 and IL-1? signaling in acute lung injury disrupts hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction."
"9616530","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Misrepair of DNA damage is a hallmark of tumor cells. DNA damage can occur from many endogenous and exogenous sources including environmental toxicants. Alkylation damage caused by a myriad of industrial and consumer based sources is pervasive in the environment. DNA alkylation leads to replication stress and DNA damage. If DNA is alkylated during replication, then the replication fork can collapse and many repair mechanisms can be utilized to repair the damaged DNA. How a cell commits to a specific repair pathway is not completely understood. In budding yeast, the Shu complex is critical in the repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSB) created by processing of replication forks damaged by DNA alkylating agents. This complex is highly conserved throughout eukaryotes and contains the Rad51 paralogues, proteins that are structurally similar to the central DNA repair protein Rad51. In this study, the investigators aim to elucidate the role of the yeast and human Shu complexes in repair of DNA alkylation damage at a replication fork. They are testing the hypothesis that the Shu complex is a critical key regulator of error-free DNA repair by shuttling DNA intermediates into homologous recombination pathway through its unique protein-protein interactions. Consistent with this hypothesis, mutation of the Shu complex proteins leads to repair by alternative error-prone repair mechanisms. The investigators will test the model that the Shu complex plays an essential role in the DNA repair pathway choice by 1) characterizing the association of the Shu complex with a damaged replication fork and the importance of its protein-protein interactions at the fork and 2) solving the structure of the Shu complex DNA binding subunits while bound to a replication fork-like substrate. These studies will elucidate how the Shu complex interactions with DNA and its protein-protein interactions direct these DNA intermediates into distinct repair mechanisms. Using what is learned in yeast to quickly and efficiently identify key substrates, residues, and protein targets, the investigators will expand their studies into human cell lines where they will investigate the role of the human Shu complex and RAD51 paralogues in repair of alkylation damage caused by environmental toxicants. The investigators will specifically characterize mutations and small nucleotide polymorphisms in the hRAD51 paralogues, which may make these individuals hypersensitive to DNA alkylators and could therefore increase cancer risk. Collectively, these studies will provide key insights into the role of the Shu complex in repair of DNA alkylation damage and elucidate how this complex promotes error-free DNA repair to prevent genetic instability. In addition, the investigators will identify at-risk individuals harboing mutations in these important genes that may be more sensitive to DNA alkylation damage and therefore susceptible to human disease."
"9528018","Human T-cell Leukemia Virus type 1 (HTLV-1) is the etiologic agent of a fatal form of leukemia and a progressive neurodegenerative disease and is also linked to a spectrum of immunoinflammatory disorders. These diseases arise from infected T-cells undergoing pathogenic reprogramming in response to complex virus-mediated processes that are not yet fully understood. To date, HTLV-1-associated diseases have proven to be highly refractory to a wide array of therapeutic strategies. Recently, however, a molecularly targeted therapy showed promise for some HTLV-1 leukemia patients. This observation highlights the importance of devising therapeutic approaches that disrupt or exploit specific viral processes as a means of sensitizing infected cells for elimination or rendering them innocuous. Considering this goal, we have focused on characterizing functions of the viral protein, HTLV-1 basic leucine zipper (bZIP) factor (HBZ), which is implicated in pathogenic reprogramming of infected cells. HBZ localizes to the nucleus and affects transcription. It contains an N-terminal activation domain that binds the homologous cellular coactivators, p300 and CBP, and a C-terminal bZIP domain. Through the leucine zipper (ZIP) sub-domain, HBZ is able to dimerize with a subset of cellular bZIP transcription factors. These interactions generally block the cellular factors from binding DNA and activating transcription. This effect is consistent with the current view that HBZ does not bind to DNA due to its lack of certain amino acid motifs normally found in other bZIP factors. Despite this property, HBZ is frequently involved in activating gene expression, but how it does so remains largely unresolved. The preliminary data in this application show that HBZ binds to a group of cellular bZIP transcription factors known as small Mafs (sMafs). Strikingly, the HBZ/sMaf complex displays DNA-binding activity. These observations led to the hypothesis that HBZ/sMaf heterodimers recognize specific DNA sequences and, through HBZ-mediated recruitment of p300/CBP, activate transcription. The objective of Specific Aim 1 is to characterize HBZ/sMaf/DNA complexes. The preliminary data in this application also define HMOX1 as a gene that is specifically activated by HBZ/sMaf complexes. HMOX1 produces heme oxygenase- 1, an enzyme that modulates cellular detoxification events such as the elimination of reactive oxygen species (ROS). This function may play a role in the survival of HTLV-1-infected cells, as the activities of other viral proteins trigger production of ROS that, in turn, can induce apoptosis. These observations support the hypothesis that elevated HMOX1 expression in infected cells reduces oxidative stress caused by other viral proteins and exposure to chemotherapeutic agents. The objective of Specific Aim 2 is to determine whether inhibition of HMOX1 activity deters the survival and proliferation of HTLV-1-infected T-cells. Results from these studies will elucidate a novel mechanism used by HBZ to activate certain cellular genes. This information will be useful for advancing molecularly targeted approaches against HTLV-1-associated diseases."

Since March 2016, N=37 cancer patients were screened for participation. A total of 24 subjects (n=12 dyads) have been enrolled and all have completed Phase I study participation. A mixed methods analysis, Phase I, is currently underway.   Due to changes in investigator status and pending analysis from Phase I of the study, a request to close the study to enrollment; open for data analysis only was submitted to the IRB. Phase II of the study was originally written to further explore quantitative measures of individual caregiver and patient as well as dyadic well-being with regard to role adjustment and mutuality. A particular focus was to be on dyads who are flourishing and those who are collaborating, to determine what they are doing differently. If this objective is deemed important after the data from Phase I are disseminated, a new study would be designed for this specific purpose."
"9549524","Despite attempts at aggressive source control in addition to intensive care unit support, mortality in the recent UK outbreak of Bacillus anthracis (B. anthracis) soft tissue infection among intravenous drug abusers was very high (greater than 40% in more than 40 patients). A noticeable finding among many of these patients was a marked coagulopathy and thrombocytopenia. These conditions greatly complicated efforts at debridement in patients. While laboratory evidence of coagulopathy and thrombocytopenia has not been consistently reported on in prior anthrax outbreaks, pleural fluid collections and meningitis have frequently been described as hemorrhagic. Thus disruption of coagulation, excessive fibrinolysis and platelet consumption or destruction may play an important role in the pathogenesis of anthrax. Understanding the basis for these processes will be important for targeted treatment of anthrax in the future.  Anthrax is associated with several virulence factors, which could potentially contribute to coagulopathy, fibirnolysis and thrombocytopenia or platelet dysfunction. On the one hand, anthrax produces lethal and edema toxins (LeTx and ETx respectively). LeTx inhibits is a zinc dependent protease which disrupts MAPK pathways important in innate immunity, cell cycling and replication and other essential host functions. Edema toxin has calmodulin dependent adenyl cyclase activity and increases intracellular cAMP to very high levels. Both toxins have the potential to alter both coagulation, fibrinolysis and platelet function. However, as a gram-positive bacteria, anthrax has a peptidoglycan cell wall which could also disrupt these functions via stimulation of inflammatory pathways. While such abnormalities related to LeTx or ETx might be best treated by toxin inhibitors, cell wall induced abnormalities might require alternate forms of therapy such as anti-inflammatory ones.  The purpose of the present protocol has been to directly compare the effects of LeTx, ETx and anthrax cell wall peptidoglycan on coagulation, fibrinolysis and platelets in a previously developed rat model. In experiments now completed, animals were challenged with 24-hour infusions of one of these three components using methods developed in prior experiments. During infusion, as well as from 24 to 48 hours, animals had serial coagulation, fibrinolysis and platelet studies performed. We previously developed techniques to measure prothrombin (PT) and partial thromboplastin (PTT) times, fibrinogen levels, and thrombin anti-thrombin (TAT) levels in this rodent species.  Other measures included tissue factor, protein C, anti-thrombin III, and plasminogen activator inhibitor.  In this study anthrax cell wall peptidoglycan had marked coagulopathic and inflammatory actions, while similarly lethal doses of LeTx and ETx did not.  This work was previously published.

"9404372","Project Summary/Abstract: Cancer Mechanisms (CM)  The goal of the Cancer Mechanisms (CM) Program is to elucidate and characterize cellular/molecular  pathways that present opportunities to prevent cancer and to improve cancer classification and treatment. The  research interests of the program faculty range from fundamental pathway discovery in model organisms,  biochemical and cell biological approaches to understanding cell cycle and self-renewal, to elucidation of  genetic pathways that present opportunities for improved cancer diagnosis, classification, prevention, and  treatment. Furthermore, new members focusing on bioinformatic and proteomic approaches to cancer have  enhanced our intra-programmatic and inter-programmatic collaborative opportunities. The CM program  currently has 22 members from 9 different departments whose research is organized into several overlapping  themes: 1) cell division and cancer, 2) gene expression and cancer, 3) cancer cell biology including,  metastasis and vascular biology, and 4) bioinformatic approaches to cancer. Diversity in the research  approaches and backgrounds of investigators in the CM program also is accompanied by significant overlap  between research themes, with clinical experience and observations informing basic science approaches, and  discoveries in biochemical and genetic model systems being translated to clinical trials. The Co-Directors  represent both ends of the basic and clinical research spectrum and leverage their diverse experience to  enhance collaborations through activities that include recruitment of new members, organizing specialized  regional symposia, attracting outside high-profile seminar speakers, and organizing regular programmatic  meetings, retreats and ad-hoc technical workshops; with the goal of enhancing members' cancer-oriented  research and facilitating collaborative projects. These activities have resulted in a strong collaborative group;  as evidenced by the intra-programmatic and inter-programmatic joint grants, cancer clinical trials translating  CM science themes, and publications. The program is a generator of discoveries of novel targets, pathways  and mechanisms to be studied in the clinic. The success of CM investigators was enabled by the NCCC  through the successful strategic recruitment of outstanding new faculty in the Bioinformatics theme (Cheng,  Greene), Pathology (Stan), Proteomics (Kettenbach), and in clinical/translational investigations (Dragnev [CE]),  the support of shared resources, and the provision of pilot funding. More than 271 cancer-related manuscripts  have been published over the reporting period (86 [32%] appearing in high-impact journals), many of them  representing intra-program (26=10%) or inter-program (76=28%) collaborations. Intra-programmatic involve all  22 CM program members, with 17 co-authors with other NCCC members, including several other programs,  particularly ICI, MT, and CE. Total funding for the program is currently $5.6M, of which $5.4M is peer-reviewed,  and $1.8 is from NCI."
"9549522","Anthrax infection remains a bioterrorist health threat today capable of affecting a large number of individuals in a relatively brief period. Defining effective but inexpensive therapies that can be stock-piled for prolonged periods and quickly administered on a large scale would be of great value for the US public in the event of an anthrax outbreak.   Production of anthrax lethal toxin (LeTx) is central to the pathogenesis of anthrax. This is a binary type toxin consisting of an A (lethal factor, LF) and B component (protective antigen, PA). PA is necessary for cellular uptake of the toxic moiety LF. Lethal factor is a zinc dependent protease, which inactivates all but one mitogen activated protein kinase kinase (MPKK 1 to 4 and 6). These MPKKs participate in signaling pathways necessary for cell survival. We and other labs have shown that LeTx can produce shock and lethality similar to that observed during live bacterial infection. Importantly, inhibition of the cellular uptake of LeTx with selective antibodies to PA is protective in bacteria challenged anthrax models, emphasizing the important contribution this toxin makes to the lethality of anthrax. Despite their demonstrated effectiveness however, antibody preparations are expensive and may be difficult to administer on a large scale. Furthermore, bioengineered strains of anthrax capable of producing toxin insensitive to the effects of such antibody preparations can be manufactured with relatively few resources. Developing alternative agents capable of inhibiting anthrax toxin is warranted.  In prior in vivo work we found that LeTx was a potent inhibitor of endogenous nitric oxide (NO) production in lethal lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and E. coli challenged rats. While such inhibition during anthrax infection itself may promote bacterial growth by suppressing host innate immune responses, it may aid the microbe in other ways as well. Consistent with this, in in vivo experiments in the rat lab, we observed that nonlethal doses of LPS capable of rapidly increasing NO levels were actually protective with lethal LeTx challenge. These in vivo findings suggest that administration of NO donor agents may be of therapeutic benefit during anthrax infection. Depending on type, NO donor agents can be produced inexpensively, stored in large quantities, and can be orally bioavailable. Such agents could be administered relatively efficiently on a large scale during an anthrax outbreak.   The present protocol is designed to investigate the potential of NO donor agents for the treatment of LeTx associated shock. As a proof of principle investigation, it has focused on agents that can be administered intravenously to ensure delivery. The study has consisted of two parts thus far. In the first part (Study 1), the ability of three different NO donors sodium nitroprusside (SNP), S-nitroso-L-glutathione (GSNO) and 3-morpholinosdnonime (SIN-1) to produce increases in circulating NO levels that are measurable (>15% of control) and sustainable over 24 hours with <15% decreases in mean arterial blood pressure (MBP) will be tested in a catheterized rat model. This data was employed to develop a regimen of SIN-1 treatment directed against LeTx.   The second part of the protocol (Study 2), has tested the ability of SIN-1 treatment to inhibit the lethal effects of LT.  In initial experiments we showed that pretreatment of LT with SIN-1 did inhibit LTs in vivo lethal effects.  Subsequent experiments showed that coinfusion of SIN-1 with LT (i.e. simultaneously via the same venous catheter) was significantly protective, presumably inactivating LT during the process of infusion.  Two final sets of experiments have now been completed in which: 1) SIN-1 and LT have been infused via separate catheters in LT challenged animal and 2) animals were treated with a NOS inhibitor and then challenged with LT. Data from these experiments is under analysis anda manuscript is in preparation.  Data from the study was presented at the International Conference of theAmerican Thoracic Society 2012 and 2014.  A manuscript is in preparation."
"9549554","Nutritional modulation of the host immune response to infection has been investigated in the critically ill with varied results, predominantly due to the heterogeneity of disease and differences in the composition of the dietary treatment. Understanding the function of individual compounds with respect to immunity would therefore be essential in evaluating the efficacy of dietary formulations. Dietary niacin undergoes several redox reactions resulting in the production of nicotinamide (NAM). Enzymes in the cytosol, mitochondria, and nucleus catalyze NAM transformation to NAD where the molecule is used in NAD(P)H redox reactions or consumed as a substrate by poly(ADP-ribose) polymerases (PARPs), CD38/CD157 ectoenzymes and sirtuins.  Research has indicated that the disparate functions of myeloid cells may be linked to altered cell metabolism such that a pro-inflammatory (M1) macrophage utilizes anaerobic metabolism whereas an alternatively activated (M2) macrophage, involved in wound repair and tissue homeostasis, utilizes oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) metabolism. The transcription factor HIF-1alpha is pivotal to anaerobic metabolism and a functional component in macrophage migration, phagocytosis, and antigen presentation. Macrophages isolated from HIF-1alpha deficient mice exhibit impaired clearance of gram positive and negative bacteria whereas pharmacological augmentation of HIF-1alpha boosts the response. Additional in vitro analysis of human monocyte derived macrophages (HMDMs) revealed that NAM antagonizes LPS-induced oxidative stress. These antioxidant properties of NAM decreased LPS-induced M1 pro-inflammatory cytokine production (tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1beta) and increased components of an M2 phenotype (CD200 receptor and C-type mannose receptor 1 expression).   In the field of immuno-oncology, blockade of the programmed death 1 (PD-1) axis is being examined as a means to induce anti-tumor immunity. Antibodies to PD-1 or PD-L1 are expected to block T cell PD-1 binding with its ligand (PD-L1, PD-L2) on antigen presentation cells or tumor cells and thereby antagonize T cell PD-1 cell signals thus encouraging tolerance. The cell surface receptor, CD38, binds NAD as well as the endothelial receptor CD31 and it additionally serves as a target for mainly B cell malignancies. In response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS), macrophages increase their expression of PD-L1 and CD38 on the cell surface, suggesting that NAM may also modify these responses.  To begin to assess the functions of LPS and NAM with respect to metabolism, we examined if LPS could induce HIF-1alpha protein compared to a characterized hypoxia mimetic, DFOM, by immunoblot. Circulating monocytes from healthy volunteers were differentiated into HMDMs with 30 ng/ml M-CSF for 7 days. HMDMs (4x105 cells/ml) were incubated with 100 micro M DFOM or 10 ng/ml LPS for 24 hours. Cells were solubilized and immunoblots were probed for HIF-1alpha or actin. We identified a 120 kDa band associated with HIF-1alpha production that is up-regulated by DFOM and LPS compared to the control.   To assess if NAM is able modulate the production of HIF-1alpha, we treated HMDMs with 10 ng/ml LPS in the absence or presence of increasing concentrations of NAM for 24 hours. We showed decreased production of HIF-1alpha in response to increasing concentrations of NAM compared to the LPS control.  Intracellular signals in RAW cells stably transfected with reporters for p65 and TNF-alpha were additionally assessed for transcriptional activation after 24h incubation. NAM reduced LPS-induced reporter activity for both p65 and TNF-alpha.  To further assess the functions of NAM, we examined characterized downstream effects of HIF-1alppha in HMDMs. We identified increased expression of CD80, CD40, and MHCI in the presence of LPS that is significantly reduced by NAM. These data suggest that NAM may alter innate and subsequent adaptive immune responses involving LPS.  PD-1 interactions with its ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2, modulate T cell/antigen presenting cell communications with negative regulatory effects. However, both PD-1 and PD-L1 have also been identified on subsets of macrophages in mediating responses to infection. PD-L1 is up-regulated by LPS and the expression is reduced significantly by NAM in HMDMs. We also identified PD-1 expression compared to an isotype control (data not shown) in HMDMs and noted that the receptor is not significantly modulated by LPS or NAM.  Research has indicated that hypoxia enhances phagocytosis in macrophages in a HIF-1alpha-dependent manner. To initially assess HMDM phagocytosis, we examined the uptake of FITC-dextran. We showed that NAM significantly reduced HMDM uptake of dextran.  To further understand phagocytic modifications by NAM in HMDMs, we examined the expression of mannose receptors (CD206, CD209) implicated in Pseudomonas aeruginosa phagocytosis.  However, the identified expression levels of CD206 and CD209 across treatments and donors were variable and not significantly different (data not shown). We then tested the expression of CD38 which is a characterized macrophage activation marker and integral factor in FcgammaR-mediated phagocytosis. In fact, NAM significantly reduced LPS-induced expression of CD38.  In summary, our preliminary studies have shown that in vitro treatment of human macrophages with NAM is able to reduce the expression of LPS-induced HIF-1alpha, MHCI, CD40, C80, PD-L1 and CD38. We have additionally found that macrophage uptake of FITC-labeled dextran is decreased by pre-treatment with NAM and the reporter activity of p65 and TNF-alpha, is also reduced in RAW cells. Our subsequent studies will focus on assessing metabolic shifts (ROS, lactate) and confirming the activity of p65 and HIF-1alpha as well as the modulation of cell surface molecules in human and murine macrophages in response to LPS and NAM after in vitro and in vivo treatment. In vivo challenge with a lethal dose of LPS in mice fed NAM supplemented or normal drinking water will also be assessed. These data are anticipated to reveal differences in the progression of pulmonary inflammation, particularly due to the distinct functions of hypoxia and PD-1/PD-L1 and CD38 in immunity and lung disease."

"9549456","HCV is a major public health problem, infecting more than 170 million people worldwide. Most cases of HCV infection become persistent and may eventually lead to chronic liver disease, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma. Although hepatocytes are the major site of viral replication, a broad clinical spectrum of extrahepatic complications and diseases are associated with chronic HCV infection, including mixed cryoglobulinemia, non-Hodgkins lymphoma, cutaneous vasculitis, glomerulonephritis, neuropathy, and lymphoproliferative disorders. The existence of extrahepatic reservoirs of HCV replication, particularly in PBMCs, remains highly controversial. It is unclear how B cells become dysregulated during the course of chronic HCV infection.   In our previous study, we demonstrated that in 7 out of 7 chronic HCV patients, HCV is preferentially associated with CD19+ B cells in PBMC subpopulations. Using in vitro reconstitution experiments by mixing cell-free HCV particles from chronic HCV carriers with PBMCs from healthy blood donors, we found that HCV particles preferentially bind to CD19+ B cells. HCV particles produced from in vitro cell cultures have minimal binding capacity to CD19+ B cells. However, when HCV particles produced in cell culture were pre-incubated with serum samples from HCV recovered patients and then mixed with PBMCs from healthy blood donors, the viral particles become preferentially bound to CD19+ B cells. Initially we thought the serum components which promote the binding of HCV to B cells were induced by HCV infection, such as HCV antigen-specific antibodies. Later, we demonstrated that the same activity can also be found in serum from healthy blood donors without any evidence of previous exposure to HCV.  Recently, we have further demonstrated that the association of HCV with CD19+ B cells is mediated by the complement system (Hepatology 2016). In this study, we used in vitro cultured virus and uninfected PBMCs from healthy blood donors to investigate the necessary serum components that activate the binding of HCV to B cells.   First, we found that in the absence of exogenous serum factors, there was negligible binding of culture-produced HCV particles to B cells.  However, upon pre-incubation of culture- produced HCV particles with serum, HCV binding to B cells was increased by more than two orders of magnitude compared to virus in the absence of serum. The essential serum factors were found to be heat- labile and present in both healthy blood donors and HCV recovered patients, suggesting that complement might be integral to the binding process. Second, the preferential binding activity of HCV to B cells could be blocked by anti-complement C3 antibodies. In experiments with complement-depleted serum and purified complement proteins, we demonstrated that complement proteins C1, C2, C3, and C4 were required to activate such binding activity.  Third, using antibodies against cell surface markers, we showed that the binding complex mainly involved CD21 (complement receptor 2), CD19, CD20, and CD81.   In human B cells, CD21 is known to form a costimulatory complex with CD19 and CD81. Co-ligation of the B cell antigen receptor (BCR) with this costimulatory complex can lower the threshold required for BCR-mediated B cell activation and proliferation. One of our major goals in this program is to elucidate the pathways through which complement mediated HCV attachment to B cells affects intracellular pathways that foster oncogenesis. For our next phase of study, we will focus on the following projects: 1) To identify signaling pathways associated with HCV binding to CD21; 2) To elucidate the possible biological responses and consequences of HCV binding to B cells using cytokine array assay; and 3) To investigate the potential molecular mechanisms of HCV associated lymphoid-neoplasms using RNA sequencing analysis of B cells derived from chronic HCV patients and matched healthy controls.   The complement system plays a central role in innate immune defense and consists of both soluble factors and cell surface receptors that interact to sense and respond to a wide range of invading microorganisms. Activation of complement system has been demonstrated during infection by several enveloped viruses including HIV-1, herpesvirus, Ebola virus, and influenza virus.. However, these viruses have also evolved escape mechanisms to evade the complement system by incorporating host regulators of complement activation into their viral envelopes and, as a result, escape antibody-dependent complement-mediated virus lysis. Complement activation upon HCV infection has been implicated in several studies. In addition, CD55 and CD59, regulators of complement activation, have been shown to be incorporated into HCV particles, which led to resistance to complement-mediated antibody-dependent virolysis, In chronic HCV patients, the level of immune-complexes in blood is often elevated. Since complement receptor 1/CD35 on erythrocytes has been shown to play a key role in transporting complement-opsonized immune-complexes to liver and spleen, the potential roles of this receptor on HCV infection need to be further elucidated.   Recently we have completed the manuscript describing the complement-mediated binding of HCV to erythrocytes. To further explore the pathogenesis of HCV-related immune complex disease, we will focus on the following projects: 1) To determine the levels of complement-activated immune complexes (IC) in plasma samples from chronic HCV patients and compare to those from matched healthy controls with a minimum of 30 individuals from each group; 2) To investigate the genetic polymorphism of complement receptor 1 (CR1/CD35) gene associated with CR1 expression on erythrocytes from both groups of individuals, and how this CR1 expression level  correlates with IC level; 3) To identify the potential molecular signatures of B cells from chronic HCV patients with elevated levels of complement-activated IC in plasma samples using RNA- seq analysis by Next Generation Sequencing."
"9549548","Critical illness and sepsis are associated with significant morbidity and mortality, especially in conditions where existing therapeutic strategies remain suboptimal, such as in necrotizing fasciitis with shock. The pathophysiology of necrosis and organ dysfunction in necrotizing fasciitis is attributed to inflammation mediated by exotoxin-mediated cytokine cascade. Intravenous immunoglobulin neutralizes superantigen mediated exotoxin released by Group A Streptococcus and Staphylococcus aureus (principal causes of monomicrobial necrotizing fasciitis). In a large propensity-matched cohort of patients with necrotizing fasciitis and shock at 130 US hospitals, we found that IVIG use was sporadic (4%) and did not improve survival. These findings were subsequently coroborated by others in a randomized clinical trial (INSTINCT study Madsen et al,  Intensive Care Med.2017 Apr 18).     Antibiotic overuse remains a significant problem in the critically ill and is associated with toxicity and development of antimicrobial resistance. We found that a third of patients admitted with smoke-inhalation associated acute lung injury at 68 US hospitals are receiving antibiotics. Using modelling, we determined that such empiric therapy was not associated with improved outcomes, and as such, this practice should be discouraged.   Among critically ill patients with suspected or confirmed sepsis in a larger cohort of US hospitals, we found that use of procalcitonin significantly reduced duration of antibiotic use without worsening outcomes.     Most estimates of sepsis incidence and mortality in existing literature are estimated using claims data. Unfortunately claims based data are subject to a variety of biases. We estimate 10-year trends in the incidence and outcome of septic shock using clinical indicators in a cohort of academic medical centers in the United States and compared it to estimates obtained using claims based data. We found that the prevalence of septic shock was rising and mortality declining over time, albiet, both less vigorously than suggested by claims based methods."
"9557281","Approximately 15 percent of patients recover from hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection while 85 percent become persistently infected with various degrees of associated chronic liver disease. In this study, comparisons will be made between patients who rapidly recover, those who have delayed recovery, those with persistent infection and stable chronic disease and those with rapidly progressive, fatal infection. The parameters measured will be viral burden (initially and over time), HCV genotype, the number of viral quasi-species (extent of viral heterogeneity) at the time of infection and subsequently, neutralizing antibody responses and, T-cell helper, proliferative and cytotoxic responses. The goal is to determine if any of these parameters can predict outcome. Studies to date have shown no correlation with genotype since the population is fairly homogeneous for HCV genotype 1. However, there does appear to be a correlation between viral quasi-species and disease outcome. Using rare specimens obtained during the first 16 weeks of HCV infection, we have measured the mean Hamming distance that reflects the extent of viral diversity (the degree of sequence divergence within the viral quasi-species). We have found that the mean Hamming distance 12 to 16 weeks after the onset of acute infection predicts whether the patient will recover from HCV infection or develop persistent infection and chronic liver disease. Patients who recover have a declining Hamming distance as antibody to HCV develops, signifying immunologic containment and then clearance of the virus. In contrast, the majority of patients demonstrate an increased mean hamming distance as antibody appears. This suggests that if the immune response is not sufficient to clear the virus, it paradoxically exerts immune pressure that results in mutations (escape variants) that lead to persistent infection. Interestingly, patients with fulminant hepatitis have a very low degree of viral diversity because they succumb to the infection before the immune system can clear the virus or exert immune pressure. This study has been published (Science 288:339-344.2000). In ongoing studies, we are measuring the viral quasi-species throughout the long-term course of HCV infection and the relation of the quasispecies other parameters to the outcome of HCV infection.  Thus far, studies have shown that patients with chronic HCV infection have impaired CD4 and CD8 cell responses to all HCV antigens compared to patients who recover from acute HCV infection.We have also found that neutralizing antibodies do not correlate with recovery from acute HCV infection, but rather continue to increase in strength and breath of activity over the course of chronic infection. Despite these antibodies, escape mutants continue to evade the immune response. Most recently, we have compared patients who have severe, rapidly progressive hepatitis C to those who have a stable indolent course. We found that patients with rapid progression have  a delayed or impaired immunologic response to HCV, an inability to reduice viral load early in infection, a greater degree of viral diversity, a diminished interferon response and, importantly, an early and sustained elevation of the pro-fibrogenic cytokine, MCP-1. We are now testing in a larger cohort wheteher MCP-1 could serve as a predictive marker of severe fibrosis in patients with chronic hepatitis C. Ongoing studies are looking for other cytokines or micro RNAs that might predict fibrosis progression. In this regard we have shown that the miRNA, Let-7, is a predictive marker of fibrosis progression."
"9568237","Goals and Objectives:  The research of the Molecular Biomedical Imaging Laboratory (MBIL) includes developing patient-based methods for detection and quantitative characterization of subclinical cardiovascular disease of the myocardium and blood vessels in both early phase clinical trials as well as in multi-center studies.  Areas of study include genetically determined disease, as well as acquired cardiovascular disease as a result of common risk factors.  Methods include advanced magnetic resonance techniques, cardiovascular computed tomography, and positron emission tomography.  The ongoing projects include:  1) Epidemiology of Diabetes Interventions and Complications (EDIC) (10-CC-N010) The Diabetes Control and Complications Trial/Epidemiology of Diabetes Interventions and Complications (DCCT/EDIC) study is to provide data on the benefits and effects of treatments and glucose lowering levels on the systemic complications seen in the Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM) population.  The NIDDK further expanded the study for an additional time to look at the cardiovascular disease, long-term microvascular, and neuropathic issues that are seen in the T1DM population.  MBIL and Johns Hopkins Hospital is working as the joined core CMR lab of this study.  MBIL is evaluating the relationship between cardiovascular disease and risk factors using CMR.  2) Non-invasive Assessment of Atherosclerosis in Patients with Disorders of the Immune System (10-I-0029, NCT01063309, PI: Dr. John Gallin) Atherosclerosis, the major cause of heart disease, is thought to relate to dysregulated inflammation in the cardiac blood vessels and possibly results from over production of reactive oxygen species (ROS).  The rate of atherosclerosis in patients with disorders of the immune system has not been well characterized but is likely to be dramatically different than that seen in the general population.  Specifically, patients with Chronic Granulomatous Disease (CGD) may be protected from developing atherosclerosis due to reduced superoxide and other ROS production by phagocytic cells.  We hypothesize that patients with CGD are at decreased risk of developing atherosclerosis.  The primary objective will be assessed using imaging techniques to measure coronary artery calcium scores and the presence of absence of soft plaque. Participants undergo prospective CT angiography, gadolinium enhanced cardiac MR and high resolution carotid MR imaging.     3) Cardiometabolic Assessment in HIV (NCT01089114, PI: Dr. Colleen Hadigan) HIV is now a chronic infection as patients with access to antiretroviral therapy have significantly improved life expectancies.  Patients with HIV also have an increased risk of cardiovascular disease.  Thus, cardiovascular disease is an important potential co-morbidity for patients living with HIV.  The study will perform a detailed cardiovascular assessment using state-of-the-art imaging techniques to evaluate intramyocardial lipid as well as coronary artery disease and myocardial function in a cohort of 100 HIV infected patients and 30 healthy volunteers as controls.  The MBIL is collaborating with NIAID researchers quantify intramyocaridial, intrahepatic and intramyocellular triglyceride content with MRI spectroscopy and the anatomy and function of heart using Cardiac CT and MRI.  5) Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA, NCT00005487, PI: Dr. Bluemke)  The Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) is an NHLBI funded study of the characteristics of subclinical cardiovascular disease (disease detected non-invasively before it has produced clinical signs and symptoms) and risk factors that predict progression to clinically overt cardiovascular disease, and that predict progression of subclinical disease itself, in a diverse, population-based sample of 6,500 men and women aged 45-84.  MBIL and Johns Hopkins Hospital have been working as a joint core CMR lab for this study for MESA exam 5.  MBIL was actively involved in the protocol design, staff training, database design and implementation, and image analysis of MESA exam 5.  MBIL has finished reading of more than 3000 cases.  6) Evaluation and optimization of myocardial mechanics and tissue composition a) Cardiac MRI core lab of HCM Net Study; Cardiac MRI core lab of Vanish study (OHSR-CC-5125, PI: Dr. Carolyn Ho) Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is the most common cardiovascular genetic disorder, marked by phenotypic and genotypic heterogeneity.  The MBIL is the core cardiac MRI lab of the HCMNet study.  MBIL has finished the reading of all cases of the first phase of this study and will continue work on the second phase of this study, which would be a medical treatment study of HCM. The VANISH study is phase 2 of this project, with MBIL delivery core laboratory training and establishing the cardiac magnetic resonance protocol for this multi-center study.  c) Cardiac MRI core lab of Halt HCM Study (OHSR-CC-11322, NCT01537926, PI: Dr. Ali Marian) Regression of Hypertrophy with N-acetylcysteine (NAC) in Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy (HALT-HCM) is a NHLBI funded study.  Despite HCMs clinical impact, there is no effective pharmacological therapy for HCM. None of the current pharmacological therapies reverses or attenuates cardiac hypertrophy or reduces the risk of SCD in adults. Cardiac hypertrophy, the essential clinical feature of human HCM, is a major determinant of morbidity and the risk of SCD. The primary objective is to perform a pilot study in HCM patients with gene mutations to assess safety and gather the pre-requisite data for subsequent robust randomized placebo-controlled efficacy studies with NAC.  The MBIL is the core cardiac MRI lab of the Halt-HCM study.  The study has enrolled a limited number of subjects to date, and the cardiac magnetic resonance studies from these subjects will be evaluated by MBIL. d)   Cardiac MRI core lab of Genetics, mechanisms and clinical phenotypes of arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy  (NCT:  pending.  PI:  Jeffrey Towbin) Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) is a common cause of sudden cardiac death in young people.  The specific aims include 1: To identify new genes causing ARVC, ALVC, and aDCM, 2A: To evaluate genotype-phenotype associations in patients with arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC);  MBIL is the core lab of this study which is currently in the start-up phase with establishment of the CMR protocol, forms and procedures to be submitted to field centers.  7) The Psoriasis, Atherosclerosis, and Cardiometabolic Disease Initiative (PACI) (PI Mehta, NCT NCT01778569) Psoriasis is an inflammation that mostly affects the skin but can affect the entire body. Another disorder, atherosclerosis, is a process in which cholesterol is gradually deposited on the wall of arteries. Many cells that cause psoriasis also cause atherosclerosis. The purpose of this study is to study the relationship between psoriasis and cardiometabolic diseases."
"9565336","The primary objective of this study remains the same: to link the capabilities of people with and without physical impairments to his or her ability to perform activities of daily living. Many of the methodologies remain the same as well, the core of which is 3D movement analysis.   We have collected data on functional movement tasks in both the arm and legs such as reaching and walking in different patient groups, specifically those with cerebral palsy, brachial plexus palsy and adults with dystonia, as well as healthy volunteers, of all ages.  This is only an assessment protocol but it has enabled us to evaluate differences in movement or physical assessment characteristics within patient groups as well as between those with and without a specific disorder to provide insights into the mechanisms that underlie motor coordination and how it can be affected by specific conditions.    This past year, we have published several papers, two of which were related to walking differences in individuals with cerebral palsy compared to an age-related comparison group and one on quantifying upper limb coordination in persons with and without brachial plexus palsy."
"9552551","Health disparities related to the provision of, and access to, healthcare in the United States are well documented across racial and ethnic groups. One area of particular interest to health disparities researchers has been solid organ transplantation. Both provider and patient behaviors are implicated as contributing to ethnic variance of medical care in kidney transplantation. Research evidence suggests that an important target for improvement is the patient-provider relationship. Trust is central to this relationship, yet trust has been described as the scarcest of medical resources.    This pilot study explored the perceptions of trust among patients in the kidney transplant process at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Clinical Center and the Walter Reed Army Medical Center (WRAMC).Face-to-face interviews were conducted that included questions related to demographic variables, the Trust in Physician Scale, the Trust in Nurse Scale and the Patient Trust Scale. Study accrual was closed in 2006. Total accrual is 113 subjects; sixty-eight subjects were enrolled at the NIH site and forty-five subjects were enrolled at the WRAMC site.   Data analysis reveals the emergence of confidence as a sixth dimension of trust in addition to the following five dimensions previously described in the literature: competence, compassion, control, communication and confidentiality. Data analysis also reveals lower Physician Trust scores and lower Nurse Trust scores among females and individuals with less than a high school diploma. Data analysis is now complete.   The identification of confidence as a sixth dimension of trust contributes to the understanding of the dynamics of trust and the patient-provider relationship. This new information has the potential to facilitate the development of specific interventions designed to improve patient-provider relationships. Manuscript development is in progress."
"9552554","Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) generates multiple symptoms and problems that can vary in complexity. Although it seems evident that patients and caregivers experience clinically significant levels of psychological distress, few interventions studies have been explored to address this concern in this population.    Problem-solving is an essential skill for individuals to successfully cope. Increased problem-solving skill has been shown to decrease psychological distress and may improve symptom distress and health related quality of life (QOL). The COPE (Creativity, Optimism, Planning, and Expert Information) problem-solving education (PSE) intervention has demonstrated benefit and has been reported as a positive therapy by cancer patients and their families.   Based on the findings from our pilot study and recent published reports, this study is designed to determine preliminary efficacy of problem solving education by increasing self-efficacy in caregivers during allogeneic HSCT. In addition, this study explores factors associated with change in caregiver self-efficacy and distress such as demographics, clinical variables, mutuality, caregiver reaction, sleep quality, fatigue and health behaviors.    This is a phase two clinical trial applying a prospective repeated measure design. Subjects were accrued to this protocol if they agreed to participate in an allogeneic HSCT at the Clinical Center, NIH, are > 18 years old, able to read English and able to comprehend the investigational nature of the study. Patient volunteers must have at least one caregiver throughout the study period.   The study was closed to enrollment in November 2010; open for data anlysis only. 330 potential subjects were screened; 195 patient and careagiver volunteers were enrolled.   Each caregiver (and patient) was scheduled for three individualized PSE intervention sessions (study intervention) in addition to the usual care group education. Three surveys were administered to all study participants. The baseline questionnaires were administered twice; once prior to allogeneic HSCT and again directly before the first PSE, at the time of initial discharge from the hospital. The post-intervention questionnaires will be administered 6 weeks post discharge. There will be no long term follow-up after the intervention period. Questionnaires include: Distress Thermometer, Family Caregiving Inventory Mutuality Scale, Health-Promoting Lifestyle Profile II, Cancer Self-Efficacy scale, Brief Symptom Inventory, Caregiver Reaction Assessment, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index and the Multidimensional Fatigue Symptom Inventory-Short Form. In addition, the subjects participated in a semi-structured interview at the end of the study and the interventionist will complete a log that tracks subject attendance, session length, and discrepancy between planned and actual session date and time. Quantitative and qualitative analysis techniques will be used in this study."
"9549435","The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of the NIH Animal-Assisted Therapy (AAT) program on distress in oncology patients treated for pain.  More than simply a physiologic or sensory response, pain is multidimensional.  Pain management programs are best developed by selecting interventions based on the individuals pain experience. Strategies with several courses of action that complement each other may be selected to work together in a synergistic response to maximize pain relief. The goal of palliative care is to achieve the highest possible quality of life for patients, and indirectly, their families, through symptom control and attention to the whole patient: addressing physical, psychosocial, and emotional dimensions.   Limited research with persons receiving palliative care for cancer indicates that a variety of complementary interventions can mitigate psychological distress and improve quality of life (Ernst, 2001).  A growing body of literature documenting positive effects of pet ownership and animal-assisted therapy (AAT) on patients with chronic illnesses warrants consideration of this type of intervention among the complementary approaches that may benefit terminally ill cancer patients.   The purpose of the proposed preliminary study is to explore the possible benefits of the existing NIH AAT program on psychological and physiological distress in cancer patients referred for pain and palliative care consults at the NIH Clinical Center. The primary outcome variable of interest is distress.  Secondary outcomes of interest are pain intensity, pain unpleasantness, and use of pain medications.  Attitudes towards pets is considered a moderating variable and will also be assessed.  A pre-post, within-subjects design will be used.  Patients will be assigned in randomized block order to a comparison and treatment condition, administered at the same time of day on two consecutive days.  The treatment condition is 20 minutes of AAT and the comparison condition is a 20-minute neutral discussion with a Recreational Therapist.  All participants will be adult oncology patients consulted to the pain and palliative care service, and recreation therapy.    Psychological data will be collected pre and post session by survey instruments; medication use will be collected every 24 hours; physiological stress will be measured by salivary cortisol and, for patients with established indwelling catheters only, serum beta-endorphin levels.   Repeated measures ANOVA will be used to assess the effect of the two conditions (treatment vs. comparison) on each of the dependent variables.  Descriptive statistics will be used to summarize baseline demographics.  At this time the study is closed to accrual and data is being reviewed."
"9472627","Project Summary / Abstract Lung inflammatory diseases such as allergic asthma affects almost 300 million people worldwide, with up to 11% of the population of the United States alone and its rate continues to increase in urbanized countries. This disease cannot be cured, making it one of the most expensive diseases for healthcare systems in developed countries. This makes this work highly significant. Allergic asthma is characterized by a balance of inflammatory cytokines such as those produced by Th2 and Th17 cells, and counter regulation of these cells Foxp3+ T regulatory cells (Treg) and IL10+ Type 1 regulatory T cells. While much is known about Tregs, very little is know about the intracellular signals that regulate Tr1 cell development and function. Being able to manipulate the suppression mediated by Tr1 cells is a potentially promising immunotherapeutic strategy for controlling and suppressing such lung inflammation. We have found that tyrosine kinase Itk regulates the development of Tr1 cells. Based on our results, we have developed the hypothesis that Itk regulates the development and function of Tr1 cells during lung inflammation. We propose experiments in two specific aims that will determine the role of Itk in the development and function of Tr1 cells in mice and human, and mechanism by which it does so. This work is extremely innovative as we utilize novel and unique transgenic mice and approaches, and have exciting preliminary data that when fleshed out, will provide information on a signaling pathway that could be used to manipulate the development and function of Tr1 cells during lung inflammation as well as other inflammatory conditions."

"9464846","PROJECT SUMMARY Klebsiella pneumoniae is an increasingly prevalent drug resistant nosocomial pathogen. Commonly, K. pneumoniae isolates are carbapenem resistant, which are referred to as carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE), and present significantly less therapeutic intervention options. Furthermore, community-acquired infections associated with hypervirulent isolates of K. pneumoniae have emerged that are capable of causing a disseminated disease in healthy individuals. Molecular studies indicate that the main virulence factor of K. pneumoniae is a thick capsular polysaccharide that facilitates immune evasion. Although 79 Klebsiella capsular polysaccharides have been identified, studies indicate that two serotypes, the K1 and K2 serotypes, account for two-thirds of all community-acquired infections, and also cause a significant portion of hospital-acquired infections. We are running out of antibiotics to treat drug resistant K. pneumoniae, and therefore, a prophylactic vaccine would be an alternative method to drastically reduce the burden of K. pneumonia infections globally. Currently there is no licensed vaccine available for individuals at risk of K. pneumoniae infection; indeed, Klebsiella vaccines are not even undergoing clinical trials. Conjugate vaccines, composed of polysaccharides linked to proteins, are ideal vaccines for K. pneumoniae as conjugate vaccines are highly protective and generate immunological memory in all age groups. However, their synthesis is complex, costly, and not conducive for all polysaccharides. To fill this void, VaxNewMo will generate the first conjugate vaccine against two of the most frequently encountered K. pneumoniae serotypes, K1 and K2, using our propriety conjugating enzyme technology. With our platform, we utilize a glycoengineering approach to generate conjugate vaccines in vivo using the lab safe E. coli through a process termed bioconjugation. This glycoengineering strategy eliminates the need for harsh chemicals to covalently link a polysaccharide to a protein. Furthermore, our conjugating enzyme is the first and only enzyme able to transfer K. pneumoniae capsular polysaccharides to an acceptor protein, a feat other conjugating enzymes are unable to perform. The proposed research in this phase I application will focus on (Aim 1) glycoengineering two strains of E. coli for the heterologous expression of the K. pneumoniae K1 and K2 capsular polysaccharides. We will then pair these K1/K2 polysaccharide producing E. coli strains with our proprietary conjugating enzyme technology to develop the first bivalent bioconjugate vaccine against K1 and K2 serotypes of K. pneumoniae. Subsequently (Aim 2), we will demonstrate the immunogenicity and efficacy of our bivalent K. pneumoniae K1/K2 specific bioconjugate vaccine compared to polysaccharide alone as there currently is no vaccine to compare non-inferiority against. Our next step for phase II funding will be to expand the serotype coverage in our bioconjugate vaccine to include the remaining six hypervirulent serotypes as well as demonstrate the safety, immunogenicity, and efficacy of the first bioconjugate vaccine against K. pneumoniae to streamline FDA regulatory approval."
"9422356","Abstract  T cell exhaustion is characterized by a progressive loss of inflammatory cytokines production followed by a functional and proliferation defect leading to apoptosis. While this phenomenon was studied recently in the context of allo-transplantation, it remains not well understood. Identifying and targeting key pathways involved in the induction of allo-immune T cell exhaustion will promote allograft acceptance.  We recently showed that the immunoproteasome (i-20S) replaces the constitutional proteasome (c-20S) and becomes highly expressed in the human and murine T cells upon allo- activation making it an ideal target for allo-immunity. Hence, in collaboration with Dr. Gang Lin, we designed and synthesized a highly selective inhibitor of the LMP7 subunit of the i-20S that revealed an unexpected role for the LMP7 in T cell exhaustion through specific degradation of the JAK-STAT5 pathway and in promoting murine heart allograft survival across major histocompatibility complex (Esilida et al, PNAS, Dec 2016). While targeting c-20S is hindered by significant off target side effects, i-20S is an ideal target for allo-immunity as it's enriched in immunocytes upon activation.  Our hypothesis is that during alloimmune T cell activation, the immunoproteasome subunit LMP7 is upregulated, promoting degradation of phosphorylated STAT5 (pSTAT5) through its protease activity to protect the antigen-reacting effector T cells from immune regulation and exhaustion. Hence, inhibiting the immunoproteasome subunit LMP7 increases pSTAT5, induces T cell exhaustion and Fas/FasL apoptosis leading to clonal deletion, and promotes allograft survival without toxic off target effects.  To test our hypothesis, we will use selective inhibitors generated in collaboration with Dr. Gang Lin in an antigen specific transplant model (OTI, OTII, OVA) and will track the allo-reactive T cell clones using a novel non-invasive luciferase technique in vivo. We also generated knockouts of LMP7 on the OTI and OTII backgrounds and a conditional knockout of LMP7 selectively in CD4 and CD8 T cells. We will use molecular techniques to identify how the LMP7 degrade STAT5 and if STAT5 activation leads to T cell apoptosis and clonal deletion. Finally, to generate preclinical data, we will test our therapeutic strategy on the human immune system using a humanized mouse model transplanted with human islets."
"9463305","Myeloid cells are critical component of tumor microenvironment. Abnormal differentiation of myeloid cells is now considered a major immunological hallmark of cancer. One of the most prominent changes in the myeloid compartment in cancer is the expansion of pathologically activated relatively immature myeloid cells with the potent ability to suppress immune responses ? myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC). In recent years, MDSC emerged as critically important regulators that suppress anti-cancer immunity and limit the efficacy of cancer immune therapy. Therefore, understanding of the mechanisms regulating MDSC function is of fundamental and translational importance. As only small proportion of monocytes and neutrophils acquire characteristics of MDSC, it remains unclear which specific mechanisms are responsible for such conversion. An abundance of immune suppressive mechanisms detected in MDSC also raised the question, why accumulation of these cells in cancer, does not result in profound global immune suppression of the host. This gap in our knowledge impedes progress toward targeting MDSC function in order to increase the efficacy of immunotherapies. Our new preliminary data suggest that type 1 interferons (IFN1) signaling have an intrinsic regulatory role in preventing acquisition of the immune suppressive potential by neutrophils and monocytes and in limiting suppressive activity of MDSC. All IFN1 (including IFN-? and IFN-?) signal via binding to a surface receptor composed of two chains (IFNAR1/2). Based on our preliminary data we hypothesize that IFN1 produced during inflammation or cancer interferes with acquisition of immune suppressive activity by MDSC. During acute viral and bacterial infections this mechanism prevents the development of immune suppressive activity by neutrophils and monocytes, which otherwise would compromise immune responses. In cancer, however, this mechanism is limited due to tumor-induced downregulation of IFNAR1. As a result, negative IFN1 signaling in MDSC is blocked and these cells can display potent suppressive activity that limits the effect of cancer immunotherapy. Thus, targeting down-regulation of IFNAR1 in MDSC may have valuable therapeutic effect. Overall goal of this proposal is to identify biological and biochemical mechanisms negatively regulating immune suppressive activity of MDSC and to develop methods of their therapeutic regulation."
"9386758","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Molecular imaging with targeted imaging probes can be used to evaluate vascular phenotype in cardiovascular disease. In the past funding period, we developed new tools for assessing endothelial activation and cellular adhesion using contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEU) molecular imaging in order to detect and quantify high risk atherosclerotic disease. Because CEU molecular imaging can detect events that occur at the endothelial-blood pool interface with high sensitivity and temporal resolution, it is a potentially valuable asset in preclinical research than can be used to discover new disease-related pathways or to rapidly test new candidate therapies. The overall aim of this proposal is to leverage the technologies we have developed in order to better understand the role of platelets throughout the course of atherosclerotic plaque development. Platelet-endothelial interactions have been postulated to play an important early role in promoting atherosclerosis by potentiating the inflammatory response. These interactions have not been well characterized because of lack of appropriate tools for assessing platelet- endothelial interactions in vivo. In Aim 1 CEU molecular imaging of platelet GPIb? and endothelial activation in a murine model of atherosclerosis will be used to temporally characterize platelet-endothelial interaction and endothelial inflammatory activation at different stages of plaque development. Mechanism for platelet adhesion will also be investigated by: (a) imaging the effects of inhibitors to the molecular pathways that may mediate platelet-endothelial or platelet-monocyte complexes, and (b) direct molecular imaging of potential mediators such as dysregulated von Willebrand factor. Since increased oxidative stress is a likely common mediator of endothelial activation and platelet adhesion, in Aim 2, we will determine whether platelet-endothelial interactions at various stages of atherosclerosis are modifiable by potent anti-oxidant therapies (NADPH-oxidase inhibitors, catalase mimetics, or stable transfection with single chain antibodies against oxidized lipoproteins). CEU molecular imaging will be an important biologic readout for these studies. In Aim 3, we will evaluate endothelial-platelet interactions and endothelial inflammatory activation in primates by studying obese, insulin- resistant, and atherosclerotic rhesus macaques. In these studies CEU molecular imaging will be combined with targeted radionuclide imaging of vascular lipid oxidation. Treatment effects of NADPH oxidase inhibitors will again be used to determine the regulatory role of oxidative stress. Successful completion of these studies will provide important new information on atherosclerosis pathophysiology which can be targeted for therapy."

"9392180","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of the Child Health Research Career Development Award (CHRCDA) program at the Children's National Health System/Children's Research Institute is to facilitate the development of successful basic science and translational research careers for junior faculty members in pediatrics. The rationale for this program is based on the observation that while many opportunities currently exist to use molecular biology to advance treatment of pediatric diseases, the complex and comprehensive scientific knowledge and practical laboratory experience that are required to capitalize on these opportunities are often deficient among young investigators. Specifically, extended bench experience is typically lacking in the traditional career development of academic pediatricians who have recently completed their clinical training. The CHRCDA addresses this need by providing sufficient protected time for pediatrician-investigators during their initial academic appointment to: 1) take coursework in basic science areas relevant to their research; 2) learn state-of-the art laboratory methodology; 3) develop preliminary data under the supervision of established investigators/mentors that will lead to submission of independent NIH grant applications; and 4) learn to effectively translate accomplishments in pediatric basic and translational research into improvements in child health. In order to accomplish these goals, the CHRCDA Scholars will spend at least 75% effort honing these skills under the mentorship of established investigators/mentors over a 2-4 year period (depending on past experience and area of investigation). During this period, each of the above tasks will be addressed in a systematic fashion, including participation in a core curriculum in research methodology and biostatistics and performance of increasingly independent research in the laboratory of investigators/mentors. We propose for consideration 20 mentors in 4 affinity areas: neuroscience, genetics, immunology, and cell biology. The administrative structure of the CHRCDA includes two Principal Investigators/Program Directors, a Training Director, a Recruiting Officer, a Program Administrator and an Advisory Committee. We propose to select and train a total of 8 CHRCDA scholars at the Assistant Professor level during the award period with a specific goal of enhancing Scholar diversity through aggressive outreach and recruitment. The outcome of this program will be measured by the products of the Scholars' subsequent academic careers: external grant support, publications, and other contributions to basic and applied research in child health."

"9428307","Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is characterized by primary impairment in social competence. Effects of current psychosocial interventions often fail to maintain or generalize and few employ rigorous experimental methods. Our treatment, SENSE Theatre, combines several well-documented, effective behavioral strategies, such as the inclusion of trained peer models, theatre play techniques involving predictable (i.e., scripted) and flexible (improvised) role-play, and repeated performance of newly learned skills resulting in greater automaticity of behavior. Recent findings from a randomized control trial (RCT) show immediate between- group effects and evidence of target engagement on the hypothesized mechanism of action, memory for faces, which was evaluated by neuropsychological and event-related potential (ERP) measures. Moreover, the RCT demonstrated treatment effects on social communication skills that generalized to home and community settings. Finally, maintained treatment effects were observed on communication symptoms. The proposed project will extend these findings and provide a stronger test of efficacy using a multisite RCT of SENSE Theatre with a large sample of 240 participants with ASD (8 to 16 years) randomized to experimental (N = 120) and an active control group (N = 120) in 12 separate cohorts. The RCT will assess target engagement of memory for faces, a foundational skill for social competence, and functional change in social interaction with peers using examiners blind to study treatment group assignment. The significance and size of treatment effects on these cognitive and behavioral outcomes will be measured using mixed level analysis. Thus, the overarching aim of the study is to determine whether detected changes in face memory and social interaction are due to the SENSE Theatre treatment and the extent to which these changes generalize and maintain. If predicted results occur, it will provide strong empirical support for a community-based treatment that has generalized effects on a set of core deficits that otherwise have life-long consequences for youth with ASD."
"9443026","Project Summary Abstract Since the mid-1900s, tobacco control policies have effectively decreased smoking prevalence in the United States. However, important disparities by socioeconomic status (SES) and race/ethnicity in smoking prevalence and tobacco-related health outcomes persist. People with relatively lower education and income are more likely to smoke than their more affluent counterparts. In addition, although non-Hispanic Blacks and non-Hispanic Whites have a similar prevalence of smoking, Blacks have lower quit rates and higher lung cancer incidence and mortality than Whites. Hispanics, on the other hand, smoke less than Blacks or Whites. This suggests that current tobacco control policies do not adequately reduce, let alone eliminate, smoking disparities in vulnerable subgroups. However, few policy evaluations address smoking disparities, and the effects of policies across different SES and racial/ethnic subgroups are mostly unknown. Moreover, tobacco control policies are generally designed with broad populations in mind, without a focus on reducing the prevalence of smoking among specific populations. As a consequence, some policies may actually be exacerbating smoking disparities, even if their net population effect is positive. The objective of this study is to determine the health equity impact of established and emerging tobacco control policies in the US. The proposed project will: (1) determine how tobacco control policies influence disparities in smoking initiation among youth; (2) determine how tobacco control policies influence disparities in smoking cessation among adults; and (3) predict which combination of policies are needed to reduce health disparities in tobacco- attributable mortality over time using a tobacco policy simulation model. Aims 1 and 2 will systematically analyze two large, nationally-representative surveys over time to determine the extent to which tobacco control policies in the US affect disparities for smoking initiation and cessation, focusing on the differential impact of policies by education, income, and race/ethnicity (i.e., Whites, Blacks, Hispanics), and their possible intersection with gender. Aim 3 will integrate the evidence developed in Aims 1 and 2 into a simulation model to predict how policies, individually and in combination, will affect smoking disparities and future downstream tobacco-attributable deaths. The proposed study will take the field beyond describing smoking disparities to producing concrete, actionable evidence informing which tobacco control policies may be most effective in simultaneously reducing both overall smoking and tobacco-related health disparities. Knowledge gained from this study will guide policy-makers? decisions regarding implementation of specific tobacco control policies by highlighting the importance of considering their contribution to tobacco-related health disparities."
"9549452","Cell and gene therapy products must be tested for sterility, stability, purity and potency. In addition, its important to test clinical cell therapy products for identity, consistency and comparability.  Testing cellular and gene therapies is challenging. These therapies are generally collected from a single person so the quantity of material available to test is limited. They are typically transfused immediately or shortly after they are produced so there is a very limited amount of time to complete the assays. Many of these therapies are complex cells that have multiple functions. The cell functions that are critical to the clinical effectiveness of these therapies are often not known. Traditionally, analytic assays such as flow cytometry, ELISA, ELISPOT and cell culture have been used to analyze cellular and gene therapies. While these assays have proven to be very useful, the number and types of factors that can be analyzed with these assays is limited.   We have been investigating the use of gene and micro RNA expression assays for the analysis of cellular therapies. These assays can require the use of only small quantities of cells and can be used to assess the expression of the entire transcriptome. We have been testing the ability of global gene and micro RNA expression profiling to determine the utility of these assays for assessing the stability, purity and potency of cellular therapies. We have shown that gene expression profiling can detect changes in stored cells and detect differences between peripheral blood leukocytes (T cells, B cells and monocytes) and hematopoietic stem cells. Gene expression profiling has also been able to detect differences between immature and mature dendritic cells (DCs) and has been useful for comparing mature DCs produced using different combinations of maturation agents.   Bone Marrow Stromal Cells (BMSCs) are being use to modulate the immune system and for a number of regenerative medicine applications including bone repair. BMSCs are a heterogeneous population of cells and a small number of BMSCs are skeletal stem cells which are important for regenerative medicine clinical applications. We have been investing BMSCs to determine markers that identify skeletal stem cells.  We are using single cell analysis and next generation DNA sequencing to identify markers for the skeletal stem cells.   Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) T cells are being used to treat a number of hematologic malignancies, however,  clinical outcomes have varied among recipients of these therapies and some of this variability is likely due to variability, and hence, differences in potency among CAR T cell products.  We are using gene expression analysis, mRNA analysis, single cell analysis and next generation sequencing to identify factors associated with the clinical potency of these cells."
"9501861","Toxoplasmosis is the most common cause of focal central nervous system (CNS) disease in AIDS. AIDS patients who survive Toxoplasmosis exhibit significant neurological deficits. Moreover, latent Toxoplasma gondii [Toxoplasma] infection is strongly associated with worse neurocognitive functioning in HIV-positive patients. These CNS clinical manifestations originate from the reactivation of latent Toxoplasma cysts. There is no current therapy that can eradicate latent cysts or reduce the risk of reactivated infection in HIV-positive and in AIDS patients. Developing any therapy to reduce the disease burden of latent Toxoplasma infection has lagged because of major gaps in our biological knowledge and understanding of latent Toxoplasma infection. These gaps in knowledge have been driven because of the lack of any genetic model for latent infection that can be specifically applied to validate drug targets for latent infection, or to clearly distinguish a specific biological role for a parasite gene in latent infection. For example, we and others have deleted various genes encoding molecules secreted by Toxoplasma and reported major or complete defects in the ability of some of these mutants to establish latent infection in mice. Unfortunately today, the field cannot easily or clearly decipher whether the Toxoplasma genes that impact latent infection perform their biological functions during acute infection (which precedes latent infection), during the transition from acute to latent infection, or during the latent cyst stages. To eradicate latent cysts in HIV-positive and in AIDS patients, the field must identify and validate drug targets that can directly act on latent cysts to cause their disintegration and clearance. To validate these potential drug targets the field requires a genetic model that can turn off gene function after latent cysts have already developed. While these genetic models are currently available for acute Toxoplasma infection for which we do have some clinical treatments, these genetic models are not yet developed for latent cyst stages for which we do not have any clinical treatments. We propose to develop and validate a genetic model to control Toxoplasma gene expression in the latent cyst stages. The genetic model(s) developed in this high impact R21 project will be made broadly available to Toxoplasma researchers to accelerate the discovery of parasite genes that are essential for establishing and maintaining the latent cyst stages."
"9549439","Cardiac allograft acute cellular rejection (ACR) remains a significant source of morbidity and mortality within the first year after heart transplantation. Afterwards, cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV), as a result of chronic vascular rejection, is the major cause of morbidity and mortality. Within the first year post-transplantation, almost two-thirds of recipients will experience at least one rejection episode and approximately one third of these patients will have multiple episodes. At five years post-transplantation, nearly 50% of survivors will have CAV. The clinical symptoms of ACR are relatively nonspecific (fatigue, dyspnea, low grade fever). Most CAV patients remain asymptomatic until they develop serious problems such as myocardial infarction, heart failure, ventricular dysrhythmias or sudden cardiac death. No widely accepted noninvasive method exists for the accurate diagnosis of acute or chronic cardiac rejection. The current gold standard for the diagnosis of ACR remains right ventricular endomyocardial biopsy (EBx), an invasive method of diagnosis subject to morbidity and random sampling and interpretation error. Likewise, the gold standard for diagnosing CAV is cardiac catheterization with intravascular ultrasound, an invasive procedure also subject to morbidity.  We are applying functional genomics, detection of cell free donor DNA, and peptidomics to study ACR and CAV. By correlating putative biomarkers with clinical, histological, and imaging based evidence of allograft disease we hope to build a database comprised of genomic and peptidomic data relevant to the immunologic relationship between the donor organ and recipient.  The Critical Care Medicine Department (CCMD) has developed and tested standard laboratory procedures for sample processing for functional genomics. CCMD has also established a bioinformatics infrastructure to support oligonucleotide microarray investigations.  Published reports have established that detection of donor DNA in recipient blood can serve as a diagnostic tool of graft injury. The level of donor DNA measured as percentage of circulating cell-free donor DNA (%ccfdDNA) has the potential to accurately diagnose ACR with a high sensitivity and specificity, possibly at times earlier than the diagnosis obtained by conventional EBxs. The ability of cell free DNA to diagnose graft injury early opens a new window to re-examine markers of rejection. These markers are traditionally evaluated using biopsy results, often positive late during rejection. %ccfdDNA offers an opportunity to better characterize our analyses. In collaboration with the NHLBI Laboratory of Transplantation Genomics, we are embarking on biomarker discovery using our collected samples and their recently developed genomic approaches.  Peptidomics has emerged as a viable and promising diagnostic tool and has been applied to diseases such as tuberculosis and chemotherapy-induced heart disease.  This tool, has been used to identify peptide biomarkers of diagnostic and prognostic significance in these disease entities.  In collaboration with the Peptidomic Nanoengineering Core at The Houston Methodist Hospital Research Institute we are embarking on biomarker discovery using our collected samples and their recently developed peptidomic techniques.    Blood and urine specimens were obtained serially from heart transplant recipients during periods of immunological tolerance of the allograft (no ACR) and immunologic intolerance of the allograft (ACR) and from heart transplant recipients with and without CAV. The samples will be analyzed to determine whether unique gene and/or protein/peptide expression patterns are associated with each state. In the latter phase of the project we hope to translate these profiles into an acceptable test for acute and chronic cardiac allograft rejection. In addition to developing a biomarker approach to the diagnosis of rejection in cardiac transplant patients, expression profiling has the potential to identify immunoregulatory pathways that can serve as new targets for immunosuppressive therapy (rational drug development).  On Oct 29, 2015 the protocol was closed to new transplant candidates with a total enrollment of 187 subjects. As of December 15, 2015, we no longer obtained samples with biopsies from those we followed that have been transplanted and no longer followed the subjects who remained on the transplant wait. We continue to collect clinical information (i.e. survival) and also continue to recruit healthy volunteers to match our remaining unmatched patients.  The protocol has obtained a minimum of one year of sample collections from all subjects being actively followed that have been transplanted. We have collected blood and urine samples during 621 EBxs. On average from each biopsy time point we stored 5 plasma tubes, 4 serum tubes, 1 tube of RNA, and 1 urine sample.  During the 2013-14 reporting period we entered into a collaboration with the Laboratory of Transplantation Genomics (LTG) of the NHLBI. During the 2014-2015 reporting period we embarked on a collaborative biomarker discovery study with the Houston Methodist Hospital Research Institute (THMHRI) focusing on using peptidomics and exosomes. The goal of both collaborations is to identify markers of graft injury.   Our protocol has created at NIH a bio-bank of samples from transplant subjects with well-characterized clinical phenotypes. Under a Materials Transfer Agreement executed on August 14, 2015, we plan to share a subset (639) of our plasma samples with the Houston group once we obtain external validation (see 2016-17 reporting period) of biopsy specimens to confirm rejection status. In addition, over the reporting period 2015-16 we also shared a subset of our plasma (1,205) and urine samples (74) with LTG. The urine samples were analyzed to determine the physical properties of cell-free DNA in urine to aid in protocol development (JHLT 35(4S):S16, 2016). From the plasma samples, 101 have been analyzed to date for cell free DNA (manuscript accepted JHLT 2017). The remainder were awaiting external validation of biopsy specimens to confirm rejection status before proceeding further. These consensus histopathology reads were completed in the 2016-17 reporting period (see below).   During the 2016-2017 reporting period, we retrieved histologic slides that were coincident to 350 bio-specimen time-points and performed consensus histopathology reads. Consensus reads were performed by two expert transplant pathologists. The data produced from the consensus reads and the clinical histopathology dataset from INOVA enabled concordance analyses. Through these analyses, we are now able to identify bio-sample time-points with concordance biopsy results for the collaborative studies with THMHRI and LTG (see 2014-16 reporting period above).

"9535715","Project Summary  The Abramson Cancer Center (ACC) has a long and successful track record of conducting innovative pilot and  Phase I clinical trials, including studies targeting specific molecular pathways relevant to cancer, angiogenesis  inhibition, cell-based therapy, and stem cell transplantation. Early Phase Clinical Research Support (EPCRS)  has been particularly helpful in supporting the conduct of high priority, innovative, pilot and/or Phase I clinical  trials. The pilot and Phase I trials that receive funding via this mechanism are of the highest priority for the ACC  as they often lay the groundwork for future efficacy studies. Trials supported by EPCRS include both traditional  ?investigator-initiated? studies of short duration (e.g., 1-2 years) and studies that result from collaborations with  industry in which the ACC investigator is the primary contributor to the design and conduct of the trial and often  has conducted the preclinical research that provided the rationale for the study.  The primary focus of EPCRS during the project period has been to enable the conduct of innovative early  phase trials. Funds have been used to support oncology research nurses and data managers for qualified,  carefully selected trials. Studies supported by EPCRS, while highly meritorious, are often unfunded or under-  funded, and thus unable to cover research nursing and/or data management costs adequately without such  support. In addition, EPCRS funded studies are generally complex, and usually include novel biological  correlative studies requiring expert study coordination. Consistent with this complexity, the EPCRS-supported  research nurses and data managers are among our most highly trained staff. EPCRS enables this core group  of experienced professionals to support ACC investigators in conducting ground-breaking translational  research studies in a manner that responds to the needs of the investigators and matches the technical  demands of the individual studies."
"9555581","Overview: The objectives of this project are to understand the molecular biology of pain sensing neurons and peripheral tissues at the transcriptome level and modulation of transcriptomic parameters in acute and chronic pain models and in human patients or post-mortem samples. The laboratory has established research methodology and protocols, built an infrastructure of hardware and software, formed collaborative arrangements, trained a team of scientists and support personnel to utilize the methodology of RNA-Seq. We have performed hundreds of deep sequencing runs in various species and models and have obtained over 50 billion reads of transcriptome sequence information.  We are intensively involved in the analysis of the resulting datasets from physiologically or genetically labeled pain-sensing neurons, neurons in dorsal spinal cord during peripheral inflammation, models of rheumatoid arthritis, inflamed peripheral tissue, axotomized DRG, dorsal and ventral spinal cords and peripheral nerve. We are also investigating transcriptional processes affected by general anesthesia in higher order brain regions.  Multiple time points are sampled to follow the evolution and resolution of the intervention with enough samples at each point to permit statistical comparison. Because we isolated certain neuronal and non-neuronal cell populations we know which genes are in pain-sensing neurons and which are in mainly non-pain-sensing neurons such as proprioceptive primary afferents, supporting cells, or Schwann cells. The ability to form incisive hypotheses regarding pain physiology is greatly advanced by this type of tissue and neuron-specific information. We now have quantitative information on all the genes that mediate DRG and spinal cord sensory and motor functions and formation of the myelin sheath in the peripheral nervous system.  TRPV1 Transcriptome: One important focus for our group is the subpopulation of DRG neurons that express the thermo-, chemo-, pH-, and lipid-responsive ion channel called TRPV1. This ion channel is also gated by capsaicin, the active ingredient in hot pepper. We have demonstrated that the potent capsaicin analog resiniferatoxin (RTX) can control cancer pain in dogs and humans indicating a crucial role for TRPV1+ neurons in transmission of clinical pain. Because of the efficacy of manipulations aimed at the TRPV1-expressing DRG neurons, we performed deep sequencing RNA-Seq on various animal and human ganglionic preparations targeting TRPV1 neurons. We published a report in mouse and rats using genetic techniques to FACS isolate TRPV1+ DRG neurons and to obtain the inverse population by killing the TRPV1+ neurons with diphtheria toxin or RTX treatment.  and isolating TRPV1+ neurons by agonist-activated calcium fluorescence. Our initial publication outlines the transcriptome results from several of the above manipulations and provides a comprehensive transcriptomic profile of this clinically important population of nociceptive neurons.  We followed this up in another publication in which we distinguished the contribution of Schwann cells versus neurons to the DRG transcriptome.  A third publication has been submitted in which we isolated TRPV1+ neurons by agonist-activated calcium fluorescence and sequenced DRGs obtained at autopsy from one of our human cancer pain patients who had been treated with RTX and a cohort of canines with cancer pain who had been treated for pain with RTX. Interestingly these data demonstrated that the most sensitive neuronal component is the centrally projecting axons that contain RTX and the cell bodies in the ganglion are comparatively resistant to RTX. This important mechanistic insight was gained from transcriptomic analyses and is being used to fine-tune the administration protocol in our human clinical trial.   Analgesia transcriptome: One of the most interesting aspects of the transcriptome analyses is quantitative insight provided by next-gen RNA-Seq. We now know the quantitative relationships between the exact genes that mediate the actions of known analgesic drugs such as morphine, clonidine, lidocaine, ibuprofen, and gabapentin and emerging targets such as nociceptor-neuron-specific sodium channels. Frequently it is not clear which molecular paralogs of ion channels or receptors are expressed by neurons in the pain pathway. Our data show that when expression for all the relevant genes are obtained quantitatively a more informative picture emerges. The transcriptome experiments also point to new targets for potential analgesic drug development. We identified an orphan GPCR that is well expressed in the nociceptive population, and are currently exploring its analgesic properties. We published a report that began with transcriptomic profiling of lipid generating genes to define a metabolic pathways for production of potentially neuroactive lipids. This novel approach predicted two new lipids which we identified using mass spectrometry. Correlative animal behavioral and human headache and psoriasis studies suggest roles in pain sensitization and itch.    Transcriptomics of human pain sensitivity resulting from genetic variations: The RNA-Seq data provides a means for amplification of ongoing studies and informs all of our hypothesis-driven studies.  We are in the process of characterizing human genetic copy number variations (CNVs) that produce pain insensitivity.  The mechanisms can be probed, in part, using rat or mouse models of the CNVs.  For example, we were able to evaluate the integrity of neurons in sensory ganglion and spinal cord in a rodent model of the hemideletion.  In these studies, transcriptomic profiling allows for more precise hypothesis generation.   Anesthesia Transcriptome: We are in the process of completing an assessment of the effects of inhalation general anesthesia on cortical and hippocampal transcriptomes and associated proteins identified from the gene analysis. This is the initial step to a larger study on general anesthesia and cognitive function in aged animals. In humans, general anesthesia can be deleterious to cognitive function and we hypothesize that mechanistic insight into the defect state can be obtained by understanding the molecular level changes induced by anesthesia and the capacity for recovery. Our results indicate that communication between synaptic input and nuclear transcriptional control is inhibited by general anesthesia and that the alterations are more pronounced in cortex than hippocampus.  We detect widespread modulation of genes that mediate functional plasticity and memory formation. Corresponding decreases in several of the proteins are also observed.  The data suggest that anesthesia can transiently uncouple synaptic activity from neuronal transcriptional control.   Summary: The datasets acquired over the past several years provide unprecedented and extremely fine-grained detail on gene expression in pain-sensing circuits and anesthesia sensitive brain regions. The basic goal is to understand how we sense and control pain. We are determining exactly what molecules the different types of pain-sensing neurons make and how they work together to do their job. We have extended this approach to actions of anesthetic agents and observe a remarkable sensitivity of cerebral cortex to gaseous anesthetics compared to hippocampus. This suggests that executive function and working memory will be the most susceptible variables affected by general anesthesia. Taken together our data provide a transformative new resource for the pain research and anesthesia communities, and will allow more precise assessment and verification of experimental and clinical results."
"9589862","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Many viral vaccines stimulate the immune system through a synergistic combination of pattern recognition receptors. These combinations of agonists are critical for long-lived antibody and T- cell responses. These multi-agonist responses could be applied as new adjuvants, but the pathways and mechanisms through which they operate remain unclear. Our goal is to elucidate a mechanistic pathway for adjuvant synergies resulting from the molecular activation of two receptors by two covalently linked Toll-like Receptor (TLR) agonists (Dual_TLRs) on antigen presenting cells. We will determine the location of a set of synergies and the mechanism by which they occur. We will test the safety and efficacy of our synergistic adjuvants using model vaccines. We will use a combination of synthetic chemistry and molecular biology tools to probe physical and biological mechanisms for the synergistic activation of two TLRs. In this application, we study the enhanced activity and antibody response of two TLR agonists that are linked together. Previously, we showed that linking agonists of distinct TLRs (e.g. TLR2_TLR9) leads to increased activation. Vaccines adjuvanted with Dual_TLR agonists improve the breadth and intensity of antibody response. Moreover, these synergies are controlled by the linker-length and receptor identity implying control at the molecular level by physical phenomenon. Studying the mechanism of Dual_TLR agonists will result in fundamental understanding of signaling synergies within cells as well as an understanding of the mechanism that links cellular responses to antibody diversity mediated by TLR signaling. With this fundamental knowledge, it will be easier to apply the knowledge gained from viral vaccines to the designing new adjuvants."

"9549431","Two approaches have been used to address this issue. (1) Healthy and HIV-infected patients receive up to 5 days of continuous infusions with 6,6-2H2-glucose, a nonradioactive, stable isotope of glucose that is safe to administer. The deuterium is incorporated into DNA via metabolism of glucose to ribose and incorporation into nucleotides. The rate of incorporation can be measured in subpopulations of cells to determine the rate of replication of those cells, and the rate of loss of the incorporated deuterium can be used to examine the turnover rate of the replicated cells. (2) Administering bromodeoxyuridine (BrDU; 200 mg/m2), an analogue of thymidine, to HIV-infected patients. BrDU is incorporated into DNA and incorporation can be measured using an anti-BrDU monoclonal antibody. By FACS analysis, both surface markers and BrDU can be measured. Thus, FACS analysis can be used to directly measure subpopulations of cells that have replicated. To date, approximately 110 patients have been enrolled in these studies. Techniques for measuring incorporation have been developed and validated for both methods. Studies with BrDU have identified two populations of proliferating cells, one with a rapid turnover, and the second with a slow turnover. The size of the rapidly proliferating pool, but not the slowly proliferating pool, is directly related to the log viral load, suggesting that HIV drives cells to enter the rapidly proliferating pool. Activated central memory cells are the primary population of cells that are proliferating for both CD4 and CD8 cells. For CD4 cells, both CD4 (inverse) and viral load (direct) correlated with proliferation, while for CD8 cells only viral load (direct) correlated. The BrdU studies have been terminated based on DSMB recommendations to no longer enroll patients, and completion of follow-up of the patients previously enrolled in the study. Currently we have no ongoing in vivo labeling projects with deuterium labeling, but this labeling approach is available as an adjunct to other studies. In vivo labeling studies provide information about lymphocyte kinetics that have relevance to better understanding HIV infection and other disease states."

"9414927","Project Summary/Abstract Parent emotion-related talk (e.g., use of emotion language) with children has been shown to be associated with later externalizing behavior problems. However, most studies examining parent emotion-related talk have relied on cross-sectional designs and therefore have been unable to understand how parent emotion-related talk changes over time. Existing studies also have primarily included preschoolers and older children, and only a few studies have examined the relation between parent emotion-related talk, child prosocial behavior and emotion regulation with infants and toddlers. Deficits in prosocial behavior and emotion regulation are associated with poor long term outcomes, including impairment in academic functioning and peer relationships, which may be increased by behavior problems. Early signs of behavior problems place these families at high risk of developing later externalizing problems. Considering the high risk of later externalizing problems, it is important to understand if there are differences in parent emotion-related talk in infants and toddlers from low- and high-risk families. The developmental trajectory of parent emotion-related talk (Research Aim 1) and the impact of parent emotion-related talk on infant prosocial behavior and emotion regulation will be examined (Research Aim 2). Specifically, growth curve modeling will be used to examine changes in parent emotion- related talk over time and structural equation modeling using multiple units of analysis, including observational assessment of behavior and parent report will be used to examine the effect of parent emotion-related talk on infant emotion regulation and prosocial behavior. In addition, differences in parent emotion related talk between parents of infants at low and high risk of behavior problems will be examined (Research Aim 3). Mentoring with Dr. Bahrick and Dr. Reeb-Sutherland will consult on normative infant development (Training Goal #1). Dr. Denham will consult on measurement of emotion understanding and socialization, and Dr. Graziano will consult on assessment of emotion regulation (Training Goal #2). Dr. Coxe will consult on developing advanced quantitative skills longitudinal data analyses (Training Goal #3). Dr. Bagner will consult on the impact of parenting practices on infant development and the unique needs of high-risk families, as well as supervise and consult on the overall proposed study and ethics. Findings will inform future work to examine possible mechanisms by which parent emotion-related talk can be targeted to help improve child social, emotional, and behavioral outcomes. The proposed training goals and research aims will prepare me for a career as an independent investigator focused on impact of parent-child interactions on the development of emotion in early childhood."
"9453438","Ebola (EBOV) and Marburg (MARV) viruses are enveloped, negative-strand RNA viruses within the Filoviridae family and are high priority Category A BSL-4 pathogens for which there are no commercially available vaccines or therapeutic agents. Thus, exploratory and innovative approaches are clearly warranted to obtain a more comprehensive understanding of virus-host interactions that regulate their replication and pathogenesis. As obligate intracellular pathogens, viruses critically depend upon host cell machinery for completion of their replication cycle including late steps of budding. Host mechanisms required for budding of enveloped RNA viruses are highly conserved across virus families, and thereby represent potential broad spectrum antiviral targets. Importantly, we and others have established that the filovirus matrix protein VP40 is both necessary and sufficient to initiate virus-like particle (VLP) assembly and budding from host cells facilitating the study of these host mechanisms under BSL-2 conditions. This approach has been used to identify proteins and pathways (e.g. the ESCRT pathway) that are critical for virus assembly, budding and spread. Moreover, we have identified and validated strategies for disrupting viral-host ESCRT interactions to block the transmission of these deadly pathogens. Our most recent published efforts establish that Ca2+ signals are triggered in host cells by viral matrix proteins and that Ca2+ acts as a master regulator of budding. Moreover, our exciting new preliminary studies reveal a completely novel aspect of this budding mechanism that involves Transient Receptor Potential Mucolipin I (TRPML1). TRPML1 is a Ca2+ activated ion channel that has essential cellular roles in endosomal sorting and exocytosis, and in plasma membrane remodeling and repair. Intriguingly, TRPML1 orchestrates the formation, both in endosomes and on the plasma membrane, of membrane protrusions that bear a provocative resemblance to those induced by eVP40 and infectious EBOV. Here, we propose that TRPML1 represents the ?missing link? in Ca2+ dependent regulation of budding. Our hypothesis is that Ca2+-dependent TRPML1-mediated plasma membrane repair machinery involving lysosomal exocytosis is hijacked by EBOV to direct the growth of plasma membrane protrusions that form VLPs/virions. Consequently, this proposal has broad impact in a critical area of human health as the mechanisms we identify will lead directly to the development of new classes of broad-spectrum host- oriented antiviral therapeutics for filoviruses. Importantly, these mechanisms are also likely to be relevant for a range of enveloped RNA viruses, including arenaviruses (LAFV and JUNV), rhabdoviruses (rabies), retroviruses (HIV-1), and paramyxoviruses (RSV and Sendai virus) that bud via similar mechanisms."

"9456048","SUMMARY: Macrophages can polarize towards opposing functional states with distinct effector functions in different diseases. While macrophage subsets likely exist in vivo along a continuum of these functional subsets, in vitro polar opposites can be distinguished, such as M1-type (IFN-?/LPS-induced) or M2a-type (IL-4- induced) macrophages. Distinct triggers can also induce other subsets of M2-type macrophages with specific functions. M1-type macrophages are considered to have antitumorigenic and proinflammatory functions, while M2-type macrophages are considered proangiogenic and protumorigenic. Particularly M2-type macrophages have been shown to promote pathologic angiogenesis in many disease conditions, including cancer, neovascular age-related macular degeneration (AMD) or wound healing disorders. Thus, defining the key molecular mechanisms that differentially regulate M1- versus M2-type polarization and identifying druggable targets to therapeutically shift polarization from the M2-type to the M1-type has important translational impact. In order to obtain a global unbiased and comprehensive characterization of the signaling mechanisms that lead to M1- or M2-type macrophage polarization we have used quantitative proteomic and phosphoproteomic analyses of macrophages during early time-courses after induction of M1- versus M2a-type polarization. Moreover, we conducted chemical inhibitor screens to define specific signaling pathways that when inhibited can block M2a-type polarization of macrophages. These approaches identified a critical role of Raf/MEK/ERK signaling for promoting M2a-type polarization while inhibiting M1-type polarization. Notably, MEK and pan-Raf inhibitors blocked M2a-type polarization of macrophages, but promoted M1-type polarization. We discovered that during M1-type macrophage polarization MEK2 activity is actively suppressed through selective phosphorylation of MEK2 T394 by ERK1 that suppresses the kinase activity. Thus, our novel data strongly suggest that inhibition of MEK signaling in macrophages can block M2-type and promote M1-type polarization. In order to test this hypothesis we have now generated mice with inactivation of MEK1 and/or MEK2 specifically in macrophages. We will determine how lack of MEK signaling specifically in macrophages affects their ability to undergo M1- versus M2-type polarization. In direct comparison to these findings we will also test how specific MEK inhibitors affect macrophage polarization, which will allow us to distinguish potential off- target effects of these inhibitors. Next, we will test whether macrophage-specific inactivation of MEK1 and/or MEK2 inhibits M2-type polarization and pathologic angiogenesis in a wound healing assay and a model for neovascular AMD. We will compare the outcomes with groups of mice treated with MEK inhibitors, allowing us to distinguish effects of MEK inhibition in macrophages from those in other cells. Our data provide a strong scientific premise for therapeutically targeting MEK signaling in macrophages and our proposed experiments have an important clinical relevance for various diseases that are promoted by M2-type macrophages.  "
"9549528","Anthrax produces two binary type toxins, lethal toxin (LT) and edema toxin (ET), which are closely associated with the bacterias lethal effects. Both LT and ET reduce blood pressure in animal models. Using the isolated perfused rat heart, we showed previously that while ET has positive chronotropic and inotropic effects (increased heart rate and ventricular contraction), it also increased coronary flow suggesting a vasodilator effect. LT in that model had some negative inotropic effects but only at very high levels. Each toxin includes a common component called protective antigen (PA) necessary for cellular uptake of the toxins toxic moieties; lethal factor (LF) for LT and edema factor (EF) for ET. LT is zinc metalloprotease that inactivayes mitogen activated protein kinase kinase pathways and has the potential to alter cellular Ca2+ metabolism. ET has calmodulin dependent adenylate cyclase activity that increases intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) level and decreases intracellular Ca2+. However, to what degree hypotension with these toxins reflects their direct effect on arterial dilation (relaxation) as opposed to indirect effects (e.g. increased endothelial permeability with extravasation of fluid, myocardial depression, inappropriate urinary losses) is unclear. However, we hypothesize that both toxins can cause vasodilation and the present study will employ an isolated rat aortic ring assay to investigate this.  In the aortic ring assay, standardized lengths of isolated rat aorta (4 mm) are connected to pressure transducers while immersed in a bath of physiologic solution. These aortic ring sections are then challenged with agents with known constrictor or relaxant properties or with experimental agents, and the level of resulting contractile or relaxant forces are measured. Normal arterial constriction and relaxation entails several pathways, but by using agents that are known to selectively influence these pathways, it is possible to decipher how an unknown agent might be altering arterial tone. The aortic ring assay was developed in the late 1970s and has been used extensively since then to investigate the pathophysiology and treatment of abnormal states of arterial tone (i.e. relaxation-dilation or constriction).   The present protocol originally included three parts. In the initial part (Part 1), the stability of the aortic ring preparation in our lab and its ability to contract with increasing concentrations of phenylephrine (PE) or relax with increasing concentrations of acetylcholine was confirmed. In the second (Part 2) and third parts (Part 3), we investigated the influence of exogenous ET (Part 2) and LT (Part 3) on contraction and relaxation of the aortic ring. These studies were subsequently published (Li Y, et al. B. anthracis edema toxin increases cAMP levels and inhibits phenylephrine-stimulated contraction in a rat aortic ring model. Am J Physiol. 2013. 305: H238-H250).  Additional studies are now underway further examining the mechanisms underlying the vaso-relaxant effects of anthrax edema toxin as well as the potential for agents to interfere with the toxins vascular effects ex vivo and in vivo.   Work from this protocol was presented at the 2015 International Conference of the American Thoracic Society.  One study from this protocol examining the role of nitric oxide production in the vasorelaxant effects of edema toxin has been published and is listed below.

The questionnaire was originally designed in English, piloted, translated into French, Norwegian, and Italian. Following IRB approval, the study sample included general practitioners and general internists from each of four European countries including England, Switzerland, Norway and Italy. In 2013 we revised the survey and administered it to a sample of physicians from Ethiopia to examine how ethical dilemmas related to bedside rationing from a developing country compare to those in developed, resource-rich countries that have already been surveyed. One publication from the Ethiopian survey has been published and two are in preparation. The principal investigator has also collaborated with non-NIH colleagues in using a similar survey among physicians across the US to determine their attitudes towards addressing costs in clinical practice. In addition, we are considering administering the survey in other resource-poor countries.     The results of the European survey have been analyzed and six peer reviewed journal articles have been published and two book chapters have been published. A book based on the research findings and commentaries from philosophers, physicians, and health policy experts was published by Oxford University Press in 2015.  These publications report: 1. The ethical difficulties encountered in clinical Practice by European doctors. 2. Physicians access to ethics support services in the four European countries in the study. 3. The prevalence and determinants of physician bedside rationing in four European countries. 4. Physicians views on resource availability and equity in four European health care systems.  5. An examination of whether ethics consultants should help clinicians face scarcity in their Practices. 6. The experiences of Ethiopian physicians which involve extensive resource scarcity, tough decisions and adverse consequences Results of the survey in the US have yielded valuable information about the attitudes of US physicians regarding their role and responsibilities in addressing health care costs."
"9557285","This study was closed in 2015 to recruitment and continues in data analysis.  Our work has contributed significantly to evidence-based guidelines as adjunct therapy for the treatment of PAH patients in an updated treatment algorithm published by the American College of Cardiology (ACC).  Findings from our RCT contributed to the ACC suggesting an upgrade to the recommendation for rehabilitation and exercise training for patients with PAH to Class 1 with a Level of Evidence: A. (Galie et al, 2013).  While the benefits of aerobic training are proven for patients who have chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and chronic heart failure, its utility for patients with pulmonary hypertension (PH) has been unclear.   In our study, we are seeking to understand the cardiorespiratory mechanisms that limit peak oxygen consumption (VO2) in patients with PH and to determine whether these mechanisms are reversible by aerobic exercise training. We also focus on relationships between indices of these mechanisms and indices of performance such as 6-minute walk distance, peak treadmill work rate, and peak exercise time. We are using a battery of self-report scales to investigate the effect of aerobic training on mood, physical activity, fatigue, and exercise readiness. Thus, our clinical trial is aimed at determining, in patients with PH, the gross mechanism by which cardiorespiratory function is limited, whether aerobic exercise training reverses this mechanism, the extent to which reversal of the limiting mechanism actually improves physical performance; and the effect of aerobic training on health related quality of life and physical activity.  This project has two main clinical research arms. The first is a phase II clinical trial that evaluates the safety and effectiveness of aerobic exercise training on cardiorespiratory fitness and health related quality of life in patients with PH. After screening and physician exam, patients with PH qualifying for study first complete a 6-minute walk test. After a 45-minute rest period, the subjects then complete self-report questionnaires on general fatigue, mood, physical activity, and overall quality of life. Patients then undergo symptom-limited peak treadmill exercise tests to volitional exhaustion. During the symptom-limited treadmill tests, cardiorespiratory measurements are made including pulmonary gas analyses, cardiac output, and near infrared spectroscopic measures of muscle oxygen extraction. After the test battery is complete the subject is randomized to either a protocol of patient education plus aerobic exercise training or patient education only. Those in the education plus exercise group attend classes on topic of importance regarding living with PH as well as three weekly sessions of treadmill walking exercise at an intensity of 70 to 80 percent of their heart rate reserve. Patients exercise for 30 to 45 minutes per session. The education only group receives identical education classes but does not exercise. Both the education plus exercise training and the education only regimens last for a duration of 10 weeks. Patients in both groups repeat all of the 6-minute walk test, questionnaires, and the treadmill tests. Pre- and post-training changes are compared between the groups. Main outcome variables are peak oxygen consumption and 6-minute walk distance.  In the second arm of the project, baseline symptom-limited peak treadmill test results in the patients with PH will be compared to results of sedentary but otherwise healthy control subjects. We will determine if muscle oxygen extraction, and cardiac output is diminished in the patients with PH at baseline. Moreover, this study arm will help us to determine whether, in patients with PH, exercise training-induced changes in the physiological response pattern trend toward normal.  There are also two sub-studies in this project. In the first sub-study, subjects in the control group crossover to an exercise only group. The group originally receiving education only will complete the 6-minute walk, questionnaires, and peak treadmill test. Following an exercise training regimen that is identical to the education plus exercise group, the group originally receiving education only will again undergo these tests. Data will be compared before and after training. This sub-study will discern the cardiorespiratory adaptations to exercise between the education plus exercise group and the group originally receiving only education. In the second sub-study, we are examining the training adaptation in patients with interstitial lung disease (ILD) who do not have PH. Patients with ILD will undergo an exercise training regimen identical to the one used for training patients with PH. Responses and adaptations will be compared. This sub-study is important for data interpretation since many of our patients with PH also have ILD.  Total Number of Subjects Enrolled = 97 Total Number of Subjects Enrolled in the current year = 0 Total Number of Subjects Enrolled that dropped = 9 Total Number of Subjects Enrolled that dropped this year = 0  Pulmonary Hypertension = 30 Interstitial Lung Disease = 15 Healthy = 52  Though the sample size was small, our RCT has shown that trained PAH patients reached higher levels of physical activity, decreased fatigue severity, improved 6-min walk distance (6MWD), cardiorespiratory function, and patient-reported quality of life as compared with untrained controls. Our research was also referenced in a panel discussion on Exercise and Pulmonary Rehabilitation at the 2014 International PH Association Conference in Indianapolis, IN, where the consensus of medical opinion stated exercise in a supervised setting is critical for PH patients (Bull et al, 2014).  Interpreting our findings to date has provided our team with opportunities to identify additional important research questions within our means to answer.  We will also utilize healthy volunteer data collected in this study to compare to data collected in our randomized controlled exercise trial for patients with interstitial lung disease without pulmonary hypertension.  The basis for the randomized trial for ILD and exercise was established by our work with PAH and exercise where we observed more efficient cardiorespiratory function, increased physical work capacity, and improved health related quality of life (HRQoL), following AET in an uncontrolle7d arm of patients with ILD without pulmonary hypertension."
"9549489","We will screen up to 58 healthy volunteers with the goal of enrolling up to 48 subjects to participate in the study.  Two cohorts will be studied. One cohort of healthy subjects will be studied with bronchoscopy and BAL (up to n = 12) at a single time point. This will provide lung and blood cells to assess immunophenotypes of resident pulmonary cells in the absence of any inflammatory stimulus. The cells will be studied with flow cytometry and with cell culture.  Cell-associated and secreted miRNA will be studied ex vivo over a 6-24 hour period.   A second cohort of subjects (n = 36) will be studied after undergoing segmental endotoxin challenge with bronchoscopy. BAL will be performed at either 6 (n=12), 24 (n=12) or 48 hours (n=12) after this challenge. Subjects who participated in the first cohort will be eligible to participate in the 2nd cohort with endotoxin challenge after a 4-week interval from their earlier participation. The cells acquired with BAL at these 3 time points will provide a means to study changes in secreted and cell associated miRNA and their relation to specific cell types.  The protocol was approved on 01/26/2015. We enrolled our first subject on 06/18/2015 and have completed eight control studies to date.The study initiated the endotoxin portion of the study this summer. We have enrolled and completed 2 segmental endotoxin challenge studies with bronchoscopy and a 6-hour BAL."
"9472969","Seasonal influenza (flu) virus, an NIAID category C priority pathogen, causes widespread infection, resulting in at least 3-5 million cases of severe illness and 250,000-500,000 deaths worldwide. While annual vaccination is recommended for all individuals aged over 6 months in the US, current vaccines are only around 60% effective and there is an urgent need for safe, more effective influenza vaccines that offer broad-spectrum protection. To meet this need, FluGen has developed a novel, live replication-deficient influenza virus, M2SR, that can be modified to encode the viral antigens from any influenza A or B strain. We have shown that the influenza A strains of M2SR (M2SR) provide effective protection against both homologous and heterologous viruses in both mice and ferrets. In our previous Phase I award, we generated an influenza B M2SR (BM2SR) vaccine and demonstrated that it also provided effective protection against homologous and heterologous influenza B viruses in a mouse model. Interestingly, there appear to be some differences in the mechanism of protection between M2SR and BM2SR vaccines. In the current Phase II grant, we will investigate the efficacy and safety of the BM2SR vaccine in a ferret model, which more closely resembles the viral infection in humans. We hypothesize that the vaccine will provide safe and effective protection against both homologous and heterologous influenza B infection in ferrets. We will also investigate the mechanism of protection in greater depth. Aim 1. To determine the efficacy and spectrum of protection afforded by the vaccine in ferrets. Aim 2. To evaluate the safety of the vaccine in ferrets. Aim 3. To investigate the mechanism of protection induced by BM2SR. These studies will provide a comprehensive pre-clinical evaluation of the efficacy and safety of the BM2SR vaccine. The outcome of the studies is expected to have high impact on the fundamental understanding of the mechanism of protection of the BM2SR influenza B vaccine and to progress FluGen?s vaccine program toward a quadrivalent human clinical trial."
"9421008","ABSTRACT Psychiatric morbidity is one of the most common and socially disabling consequences in adults with mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI), yet poorly studied in youth. According to the International Collaboration in mTBI Prognosis, prediction of psychiatric morbidity in mTBI remains a challenge. Post-concussion symptoms are highly aspecific and significantly overlap with psychiatric symptoms. In fact, depression, anxiety, mood lability, and irritability are common after injury. Yet, a clear link between pathophysiologic mechanisms of mTBI and the subsequent onset of post-TBI psychiatric symptoms remains unclear. This relationship is of utmost importance in the study of developing brains, where brain lesions have the potential to mine the normative development of neural circuitries involved in emotional regulation. An imbalance in fronto-temporo-limbic systems has been proposed as a neural mechanism of emotional dysregulation in pediatric psychiatric disorders. Yet, no study has examined the relationship between fronto-temporo-limbic lesions and the onset of post-TBI psychiatric symptoms. The rational for the proposed research is that abnormalities in fronto-temporo- limbic regions in youth with mTBI might represent the structural basis for the vulnerability of emotional regulation circuitries, possibly leading to a heightened risk for post-TBI psychiatric morbidity. The objective of this application is to use multimodal neuroimaging techniques to characterize the brain structure and functioning of emotional regulation circuitries in 200 youth 1 week after injury. Five clinical assessments will define 1-year trajectories of depressive symptoms, anxiety, mood lability and irritability in each participant. Based on the extant literature and our preliminary findings, our overall hypothesis is that acute injury quantifiable with neuroimaging measures of brain structure and functioning predates the onset and course of post-TBI psychiatric symptoms in youth prospectively characterized for up to 1 year after injury. Specifically, this proposal aims to 1) examine if mTBI-related lesions in fronto-temporo-limbic regions predict the severity of post-TBI psychiatric symptoms 3 weeks after injury. This proposal also aims to 2) identify demographic and clinical risk factors predicting 1-year trajectories of post-TBI psychiatric symptoms. This approach is innovative because no study examined if mTBI- related lesions in emotional regulation circuitries relate to the acute onset of post-TBI psychiatric symptoms in youth with mTBI. The identification of 1-year trajectories of post-TBI psychiatric symptoms is also innovative and will allow to examine if the combined use of neuroimaging measures and clinical risk factors can help predict these symptoms up to 1-year after mTBI. Finally, by collecting a second scan in a subsample of youth (n=100) 6 months after mTBI, we will examine if neuroimaging measures at 6-month, more than neuroimaging measures at-injury, can help predict 1-year trajectories of post-TBI psychiatric symptoms. This contribution is anticipated to be significant because this strategy has the potential to identify a subset of youth at-risk for developing post-TBI psychiatric morbidity, who might benefit from early intervention strategies."
"9393986","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overarching objective of this DDRCC is to foster and facilitate research in inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) and related inflammatory diseases of the bowel. This theme has defined our GI program for 75 years, ever since Dr. Joseph B. Kirsner, the founder of modern gastroenterology at the University of Chicago, put forward the hypothesis that inflammatory bowel diseases are caused by combination of genetic, immunological, and microbial factors. We now know this is indeed the case, but recognize that other factors associated with recent changes in environment, lifestyle, and diet, are contributing to the increased prevalence and incidence of these diseases. The DDRCC has been the foundation of IBD research at the University of Chicago allowing us to build a highly collaborative, multidisciplinary team, a fully integrated translational research infrastructure, an state-of-the-art core facilities and services. In addition, the DDRCC has partnered with two University of Chicago affiliates, Argonne National Laboratory (ANL) and the Marine Biological Laboratory (MBL) at Woods Hole, to attract new investigators to the field and leverage their resources, talent, and facilities for the investigation of inflammatory diseases of the bowel. The central hypothesis of the collective group is that IBD and related inflammatory diseases of the bowel arise from a confluence of host, microbial, immunological, and environmental factors. The program is now in its 24th year, and, despite being a highly focused research program, the research base has steadily increased to 51 full and 16 associate member investigators with a total annual direct cost funding for digestive diseases of $14.8 million, of which ~$5.7 million comes from NIDDK (21% increase from 2009). The program has 4 major interrelated research themes that focus on the etiopathogenesis of IBD: (1) host immune/tissue responses, (2) the gut microbiome, (3) host genetics and gene function, and (4) environmental modifiers. The 4 DDRCC cores embracing these themes have continuously evolved to meet the needs of investigators and to anticipate new trends and technologies in biomedical research. The DDRCC has received tremendous institutional support as 1 of 5 priority areas designated for development by the Division of Biological Sciences. The DDRCC has successfully supported new investigators, but also drawn in talented scientists outside of the field of digestive diseases  (15 now full members since 2010). Over the past two funding cycles, the P&F program has resulted in over $25M in extramural funds, or a 25 to 1 return-on-investment. Over the past funding cycle, 56% of the 306 publications acknowledging the DDRCC for its support were coauthored by two or more DDRCC members, indicating a high level of collaborative science. The number of high impact papers (Impact factor>20) published by DDRCC members has nearly doubled compared to the previous funding cycle. Thus, the DDRCC has successful met its goals of advancing the science and translation of discovery in inflammatory diseases of the bowel. The DDRCC as a whole is greater than the sum of its parts. It provides strategic vision, cutting-edge, high quality, and cost-effective services and resources, and gives opportunity to current and next generation scientists to flourish in a highly collaborative and productive environment."
"9426498","Project Summary/Abstract  A vast number of mutations contribute to cancer, but the observed non-random combinations of these leading to transformation highlight the importance of hallmark pathways and networks in cancer progression. While many pathways have been implicated in cancer, tumor heterogeneity stemming from different mutagens, tissue of origin, degree of progression, etc. leads to each case exhibiting a unique subset of altered pathways. Taken together, this diversity among cancer types and their origins, compounded by the huge genetic and epigenetic heterogeneity of tumors has complicated the development of targeted cancer treatments. The premise of this project is that cancer mutations converge into genetic interaction networks, and these networks bring together mutations of all varieties, including genes with low frequency of oncogenic mutations, and tumor suppressor profiles. We thus hypothesize that by systematically mapping these networks in both cell lines and in clinically relevant patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models, new molecular targets for cancer therapy can be identified. Focusing on head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC), a disease that results in over 250,000 deaths each year worldwide, the aims correspondingly focus on using state-of-the-art high-throughput epistasis mapping via CRISPR-Cas and coupled single-cell analyses to enable systematic interrogation of the functions of individual genes and gene-pairs while notably also assaying the impact of tumor heterogeneity. Towards this we aim to utilize an extensive panel of >50 HNSCC cell lines and >50 PDX models. To enable screening across this vast collection we will utilize focused libraries and cell barcoding strategies that will allow us to efficiently screen across genes and cell panels via integrated pooled experiments. Coupled with rigorous in vitro and in vivo drug and targeted genetic validations in preclinical models, we anticipate our integrated experimental and computational framework will result in unprecedented insights into the underlying tumor biology as well as unraveling of clinically actionable genetic vulnerabilities to advance the practice of precision oncology."
"9453998","Project Summary We propose to explore and document structural heterogeneities in virus capsid populations, using a combination of computer simulations and the re-examination of raw cryo-electron microscopy (cryoEM) data. Although structural biology methods by design typically yield virus capsid models that are free of defects, both in vivo and in vitro capsid populations exhibit structural heterogeneities of probable biological and potential therapeutic importance. Characterizing and understanding meta-stable structures that are partially or mis- assembled could lead to strategies for retarding assembly by inducing these off-pathway states. We propose to focus on hepatitis B virus (HBV) as a model system for this exploratory R21. HBV has previously been studied by the PIs using both computational and experimental approaches. Methodologically, we will computationally generate a large set of three-dimensional models of defective HBV capsids which will be filtered in an iterative fashion by comparison to existing two-dimensional cryoEM images. The models will be generated both by (i) assembly and disassembly simulations and (ii) combinatorial removals of capsomers from the fully symmetric structure. Simulations will employ the recently developed tabulation approach which has enabled assembly simulations at an unprecedented level of structural detail; additionally, the weighted ensemble enhanced sampling approach will be employed, as it has been shown to yield detailed assembly pathways. Structural models which are validated by comparison to cryoEM data will be made publicly accessible. The basic idea of the proposal may be seen as mirroring the change in perspective which has taken hold in single-molecule structural biology: it is now widely accepted that understanding the function of complex biomolecules requires an `ensemble picture' of multiple structures representing functional pathways and motions. We believe that heterogeneity in virus capsid structural behavior could be equally important and merits careful investigation. This proposal is an attempt to initiate an in-depth investigation into capsid defects, which could be of long-term therapeutic importance."
"9377481","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the leading cause of age-related neurodegeneration. Its prevalence is predicted to greatly increase with the increasing numbers of elderly in the United States. While histological hallmarks of AD are well characterized, the mechanisms of AD are still unclear. Recent studies have characterized the transcriptional and epigenetic alterations in post-mortem brains of AD patients. This work suggests that epigenetics changes, induced by a combination of external stressors and aging, contribute to AD progression. DNA methylation is a covalent modification to DNA and an epigenetic mark with the capacity to induce long- lasting changes to gene expression. Reproducible alterations to DNA methylation at specific genomic regions have been associated with AD in large patient cohorts, including at genomic segments adjacent to genes with AD susceptibility variants. The functional importance of these changes, however, has been difficult to assess. Heterogeneity in sample composition, disease course, and genetic background are confounding factors, as is the stochastic nature of epigenetic lesions at the level of the individual cell. These limitations have prevented meaningful correlations of epigenotype and phenotype and thwart identification of epimutations that functionally contribute to the Alzheimer's disease state. There is need for a tractable, genetically controlled AD model system in disease-relevant human cell types that allows for assessment of DNA methylation status at single cell resolution. To this end, this proposal aims to develop and characterize an in vitro model of AD neurons derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs). Ongoing work is being completed to define in vitro culture conditions that induce methylation changes at AD-associated differentially methylated regions (DMRs). This will allow for the assessment of the role of AD-DMRs in regulating gene expression with potential to alter AD phenotypes. A combination of genetic and culture condition based stressors that mimic AD are being used in conjunction with the Reporter of Genomic Methylation (RGM), our recently developed genetic tool for assessing DNA methylation at single-cell resolution. By inserting the RGM adjacent to an AD-DMR, it is possible to isolate cells with a specific DNA methylation perturbation and correlate transcriptional and molecular phenotypes. The proposed experiments will be the first to systematically characterize factors that contribute to the epigenetic alterations in AD. This work will also provide previously unobtainable resolution to the correlation of DNA methylation and transcriptional changes associated with disease. Finally, a model of the induction of AD- associated epigenetic errors will enable further basic mechanistic studies. This work will act as a stepping- stone for understanding why and how DNA methylation changes occur in neurodegenerative disorders."
"9404373","Project Summary/Abstract: Molecular Therapeutics (MT)  The goal of the Molecular Therapeutics (MT) Program is to identify therapeutic targets, drugs, and strategies,  and to facilitate the translation of Dartmouth-investigator hypotheses into clinical trials. The research interests  of the program faculty cover the full spectrum of investigations in molecular therapeutics and include synthesis  of novel compounds as research tools and potential therapeutics; investigation of novel targets for therapy;  assessment of predictors of disease progression or drug response; and proof-of-concept and therapeutic early  phase clinical trials. The MT program currently has 30 members from 9 different departments whose research  foci can be described under the following four scientific themes: (1) Synthesis and discovery of novel  compounds and potential cancer drugs, (2) Interrogation of potential new targets and therapeutic strategies, (3)  Development of biomarkers for cancer diagnosis and prediction of treatment response, and (4) Development of  hypothesis-based cancer clinical trials. These four research themes do not exist as separate entities. There is  extensive interaction between them, as novel drugs and compounds are used to interrogate novel targets,  novel biomarkers are being identified, and these advances are being translated into molecular proof-of-  principle clinical trials. The interactions across this spectrum are catalyzed by the interactive environment  generated by activities of the MT program, its deep involvement in the Early Phase Trials Clinical Oncology  Group (EPTCOG), and by the continual nurturing and mentoring of program members by the Program Co-  Directors. This work results in extensive collaborations across the entire spectrum of molecular therapeutics,  as evidenced by joint grants and publications. Major contributions of the program to the NCCC mission have  been the facilitation of discoveries promising new therapeutic approaches, the translation of Dartmouth  investigator hypotheses into clinical trials, and the accrual of patients to such studies. In addition, NCCC has  made substantial commitment to improving the depth and breadth of research and clinical translation in the MT  program through support of shared resources, financially supporting many of the costs associated with early-  phase/proof-of-principle clinical trials, and strategic recruitment of new investigators. For example, over the  past 5 years, the membership of the program has evolved with the successful recruitment of outstanding new  faculty in the biological laboratory sciences (Miller, Kurokawa), chemistry (Micalizio, Wu), and in  clinical/translational investigations (Danilov, Lansigan, Smith). More than 363 cancer-related articles have  been published over the reporting period (54 [15%] in high impact journals), many of them representing intra-  program (69=19%) or inter-program (107=29%) collaboration. These collaborations involve 29 MT program  members and 63 NCCC members, almost equally distributed between the other 5 NCCC research programs.  Total funding for the program currently is $8.0M, of which $6.0M is peer-reviewed and $3.4M is from NCI."
"9557291","1. MicroRNA changes in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL).  As a followup to our work that was published in Leukemia this year on miRNA changes in CLL in response to Ibrutinib treatment, we continued analysis of miRNA profiles in CLL patient cells in relationship to differing prognostic subgroups based on IGHV mutation status, immunophenotypic profile, cytogentic abnormalities, and ZAP-70 positivity; and to circulating B-cells from controls. All of the miRNAs in our panel were significantly differentially expressed in CLL in comparison to controls.  Significantly altered miRNA expression was associated with disease stratification based on IgHV mutational status (mutated vs. unmutated) and ZAP-70 positivity.  The findings provide evidence that miRNA expression patterns are linked to disease biology and related to diagnosis, prognosis and risk assessment in CLL.  A manuscript with the findings is in preparation.    2. RAS-associated Autoimmune Leukoproliferative Disorder (RALD)  is a chronic indolent condition that typically presents in childhood with monocytosis, lymphocytosis, autoimmune phenomena, splenomegaly, and variable lymphadenopathy. RALD is characterized by somatic mutations in KRAS or NRAS in hematopoietic cells. Despite the indolent course of RALD, it shares some overlapping clinical features and similar genetic defects with Juvenile Myelomonocytic Leukemia (JMML), which is also characterized by underlying RAS-pathway mutations.  The nature of RALD is somewhat controversial as many pediatric hematologist/oncologists argue that RALD may represent a form of JMML or a precursor disease with the potential of transforming into JMML; although malignant transformation to JMML or acute leukemia has not been observed in the large RALD cohort followed at NIH to date.  In 2016-2017, in collaboration with Dr. Koneti Rao, we performed whole exome sequencing on peripheral blood mononuclear cells from a cohort of RALD patients.  WES identified the known somatic NRAS or KRAS mutations but no other pathogenic mutations (including those commonly seen in JMML) were identified in any of the RALD patients under the age of 40.   Variants predicted to be pathogenic were identified in two patients diagnosed with RALD who are over the age of 40, and this is being further investigated.  RNA seq was also performed on RALD samples and compared with controls revealing significant differences based on gene ontology analyses, involving multiple cellular processes including immune response and intracellular signaling.  One of the RALD patients over the age of 50 has developed two separate B-cell lymphomas.  WES of the second diffuse large B-cell lymphoma sample was performed in the past year and showed presence of the persistent somatic NRAS mutation with an additional variant, predicted to be pathogenic, in a known tumor suppressor gene associated with lymphomagenesis.  These findings raise the possibility of predisposition to lymphoid neoplasia, but require further study and longterm followup with the RALD cohort; no other RALD patient in our cohort has developed lymphoma.  A platform presentation of this research was presented at the International JMML Foundation workshop at the American Society of Hematology Annual meeting in December 2016, and a manuscript is in preparation.        3. MicroRNA profiling of GATA2 deficiency associated myelodysplasia (MDS) / acute myeloid leukemia (AML).  Somatic and inherited germline mutations in GATA2 have been identified in patients diagnosed with monocytopenia, B-cell and NK-cell lymphopenia, susceptibility to opportunistic infections (e.g. disseminated MAC), and a strong propensity to develop hypocellular MDS/AML or CMML.  We previously identified significantly altered levels of miRNAs in EBV transformed cell lines from patients with GATA2 deficiency, and performed functional studies to identify mRNA targets of miR-181c and mir-424. During the past year we expanded functional studies using luciferase reporter constructs furether validating the regulation of MCL-1 by miR-181c, and the regulation of FLT3 and FLT3LG by mir-424. We also completed a collaborative study with Dr. Cynthia Dunbar and Dr. Steven Holland focused on NK-cell lymphopoiesis in GATA2 deficiency.  Additionally, we began isolating megakaryocytes from GATA2 patients for transcriptomic analysis, and targetted sequencing.  A manuscript was published in Blood with our contribution to the NK-cell GATA2 study, and a final manuscript of the miRNA functional studies is in preparation.     4. Immunophenotypic and morphologic analyses of rare diseases with bone marrow and peripheral blood pathology.  Multiple collaborative research studies continued in 2016-2017: a) we characterized abnormal bone marrow hematopoiesis in ADA2 deficiency (or DADA) in collaboration with Dr. Daniel Kastner and Dr. Chip Chambers at Vanderbilt University, a platform presentation for this work was given at the 1st International DADA2 meeting in November 2016;  b) ongoing collaborative studies in aplastic anemia with Dr. Neal Young and Dr. Danielle Townsley demonstrated that the drug eltrombopag restores trilineage hematopoiesis and expansion of CD34 positive stem cells in the bone marrow  this work was published in the NEJM in 2017,  c) in collaboration with Dr. Gulbu Uzel and Steve Holland we characterized abnormal bone marrow features of patients with germline mutations in PIK3CD, and CTLA4 which often present with features overlapping with aplastic anemia and LGL leukemia, and d) continuation of studies in myeloma with Dr. Ola Landgren and Dr. Maryalice Stetler-Stevenson resulted in several publications."

"9552565","Bacteria that produce carbapenemases, such as the K. pneumoniae carbapenemase (blaKPC), are increasingly common multidrug resistant pathogens causing nosocomial infections and outbreaks, with high rates of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Extensive routine in-house surveillance and screening is performed in the Clinical Center. All blaKPC/blaNDM-1 PCR positive isolates are sequenced for epidemiological and research purposes. Overall, we have a very low presence of CPOs, with data analysis suggesting that for most of patients who are positive for CPOs, it is likely that the bacteria were acquired outside of the institution. Environmental surveillance can be useful to identify the source of an outbreak, test efficacy of preventative infection control measures, and, more recently, to better understand the microbiome of the hospital. We are investigating the flora of the hospital environment at a closer level then has been done previously, and performing genomic analyses on identified resistant organisms as well as comparing the new sequences to the database of information obtained on patients over multiple years."
"9259535","Project Summary Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is an X-linked recessive disorder that is primarily characterized by the progressive loss of mass and strength. Despite the advancement of gene and molecular therapy for DMD, there is no cure for this disease. Muscles of DMD patients and of the dystrophic mdx mouse model exhibit elevated numbers of immune cells, primarily macrophages. A growing body of research demonstrates that the immune response to dystrophic muscle modulates muscle injury and regeneration. In chronic injuries, like muscular dystrophy, these interactions can become disrupted and exacerbate the pathology. The ability of macrophages to migrate to sites of muscle injury and modulate injury and repair makes these cells ideal vehicles to deliver therapeutic molecules to injured muscle, as needed. The main goal of this investigation is to genetically modify the hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), from which macrophages are derived, so that upon transplantation the modified macrophages will express therapeutic molecules that can ameliorate the DMD pathology. Our strategy is to precondition dystrophic mdx mice with non-myeloablative drug busulfan, then transplant HSCs that have been genetically modified ex vivo to express a therapeutic gene, and then assay for the effects on muscle function and the pathology. The results from this study will provide a new platform for delivering therapeutic molecules to DMD muscle in a site-specific manner. This new therapeutic strategy can also be expanded to other forms of muscular dystrophies as well as other diseases where the inflammation and immune cells mediate the pathology."
"9524069","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Local interactions in the immune system determine whether an immune response is protective or destructive, fighting infection or initiating autoimmunity. Adaptive immunity begins in the lymph node (LN), a highly organized and dynamic tissue. Currently, it is difficult to parse the role of inflammatory mediators or rationally design therapies for chronic inflammatory disease such as artherosclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis, which together affect 5 ? 7% of the Western population. We hypothesize that analyzing local responses ex vivo in intact tissue will provide information not easily obtained from current methods (in vitro/in vivo). Such experiments require new tools to analyze dynamics in the immune system, which we develop by combining expertise in bioanalytical chemistry, microfluidics, and immunology.  In this project, we will develop a novel ex vivo model of immunity, using a hybrid of microfluidic culture and LN slices. In Aim 1, we will establish long-term culture coupled with analysis methods for live murine and human LN slices. Slice culture offers the advantage of preservation of the extracellular microenvironment and any matrix-bound signals. We will optimize long-term culture (7-21 days) for murine LN slices and human tonsil slices to maintain high viability, low cellular activation markers at rest, and ability to respond to inflammatory and antigen-specific stimuli. In Aim 2, we will develop a novel microfluidic system for on-demand local stimulation of LN slices. We will improve the spatial resolution of our previously developed device, to target clusters 2 ? 10 cells in diameter (20 ? 100 ?m lateral resolution) using short- and long-term stimulation. We will also enable on-demand selection of delivery zone by using a mobile port, making the whole tissue accessible with minimal handling. In Aim 3, we will validate the hybrid microfluidic-tissue slice system for analysis of inflammatory responses and anti-inflammatory therapies. We will compare the inflammatory response to a pro-inflammatory cytokine, TNF-?, in slices versus cell cultures and in vivo systems. Finally, we will test the extent to which the model provides new information to guide immunotherapy, by using the hybrid tissue-chip system with mouse and human tissue to compare the effects of competing TNF-? inhibitors (anti-TNF-? monoclonals or soluble TNF-? receptor).  Combining local microfluidic stimulation with tissue slice technology produces the first experimental platform for analysis of spatially organized signaling and cell-cell interactions in live LN tissue. This innovative platform will advance both basic and translational biomedical research: locally delivered cytokines will serve as a much-needed model of acute or chronic inflammation, and locally delivered immunotherapies will guide the design of targeted drug-loaded nanoparticles. This technology is broadly applicable for a host of inflammatory diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis, Chron?s disease, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer?s disease, and cancer."
"9572330","The purpose of this qualitative case study is to explore the perceptions of oncology clinical research nurses about the phenomena of therapeutic misconception that can occur in cancer patients participating in phase 1 and phase 2 oncology clinical trials. The targeted population for this study are NIH Clinical Center oncology clinical research nurses who provide direct bedside nursing care to phase 1 and phase 2 oncology clinical trials participants. Twenty-five oncology clinical research nurses volunteered to participate in a 45-minute face-to-face interview session with the lead investigator. During the interview six open-ended questions were presented to study participants. The interview questions address the overarching research question: what are the perceptions of oncology clinical research nurses' about the phenomena of therapeutic misconception among phase 1 and phase 2 oncology clinical trials participants. The interviews were audio-recorded upon written consent of the study participants. The results of 25 face-to-face interview are currently being transcribed and analyzed."
"9562830","The overall goal of this program is to improve pain management in sickle cell disease (SCD) patients. Our work aims to identify objective pain sensitivity measurements to serve as clinical endpoints to test the efficacy of novel analgesic agents, to conduct mechanistic studies in mouse models of SCD and to conduct pre-clinical screen of potential therapeutic agents able to reduce SCD pain.  Pain phenotypes in sickle cell disease (SCD) patients are highly variable.  A small percentage of SCD patients experience many vaso-occlusive crises/year, 5% of patients account for over 30% of pain episodes, while 39% report few episodes of severe pain.  The underlying mechanisms of such variability of pain phenotype is incompletely understood, which in turn partially explains the high readmission rates among SCD patients.  Clearly, a better understanding of the pathobiology of SCD is needed to improve its therapy.  Humanized sickle cell mice recapitulate several phenotypes of SCD patients and provide models for the study of SCD pain.  In a large cross-sectional study of SCD mice, we examined thermosensory response and sensory nerve fiber function using sine-wave electrical stimulation at 2000, 250, and 5 Hz to preferentially stimulate A, A, and C sensory nerve fibers respectively.  We use two strains of humanized SCD mice (BERKs and Townes), which have been studied extensively and shown to display the hematologic abnormalities seen in SCD.  We are now investigating the role of novel approaches to treat pain in SCD.  Specifically we are examining the roles of the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin, which in erythroid precursor cells from normal human subjects has been shown to increase fetal hemoglobin.  We are also evaluating the effect of the 2 adrenoreceptor agonist, dexmedetomidine in the nociception phenotype SCD mice.  We have shown that BERK and Townes mice, compared to respective controls, have decreases in 2000, 250, and 5Hz current vocalization thresholds in patterns that suggest sensitization of a broad spectrum of sensory nerve fibers during basal conditions.  In addition, the pattern and degree of sensitization of sensory fibers varied according to strain, sex, age, and genotype of the mice.  In a similarly variable pattern, both Townes and BERKs also had significantly altered sensitivity to noxious thermal stimuli in agreement with what has been shown by others.  Therefore, the analysis of somatosensory function using sine-wave electrical stimulation in humanized sickle cell mice suggests that in SCD, both myelinated and unmyelinated, fibers are sensitized.  The pattern of sensory fiber sensitization is distinct from that observed in pain models of neuropathic and inflammatory pain. Using the same paradigm of quantitative sensory testing used in sickle cell mice, we have shown that sickle cell disease patients who display a severe pain phenotype, have sensitization of myelinated sensory nerve fibers.  These findings raise the possibility that sensitization of a broad spectrum of sensory fibers might contribute to the altered and variable nociception phenotype in SCD. This past year, we have also characterized the neurocognitive behavior profile of humanized SCD mice (Townes, BERK) and identified the hematologic and neuropathologic abnormalities associated with the behavioral alterations observed in these animals.  Both heterozygous and homozygous Townes mice displayed severe cognitive deficits characterized by significant deficits in spatial learning compared to controls. Homozygous Townes also had increased depression- and anxiety-like behaviors as well as reduced performance on voluntary wheel running compared to controls. Behavior deficits observed in Townes were also seen in BERK sickling mice. Interestingly, most deficits in homozygotes were observed in older mice and were associated with worsening anemia and neuropathologic abnormalities including the presence of large bands of dark/pyknotic (shrunken) neurons in CA1 and CA3 fields of hippocampus and evidence of neuronal dropout in cerebellum.  These observations suggest that altered nociception and cognitive and behavioral deficits in SCD mice mirror those described in SCD patients and that aging, anemia, and profound neuropathologic changes in hippocampus and cerebellum are possible biologic correlates of those deficits. These findings support using SCD mice for studies of cognitive deficits in SCD and point to vulnerable brain areas with susceptibility to neuronal injury in SCD and to mechanisms that potentially underlie those deficits."
"9509144","Project Summary/Abstract The emergence of pathogenic viruses represents continuous infectious disease threats to public health. Among these, the paramyxoviruses, which include many important human and animal pathogens, also include two excellent examples of emerged, zoonotic pathogens of importance: the henipaviruses; Hendra virus (HeV) and Nipah virus (NiV). HeV and NiV have a uniquely broad host tropism capable of infecting at least 18 animal species across 6 orders of mammals. HeV and NiV can also cause a systemic and often fatal respiratory and/or neurological disease in 11 mammalian species including humans. These henipaviruses remain significant biothreats to humans and economically important livestock in Australia and throughout South East Asia, and there are no vaccines or antivirals approved for human use. The henipaviruses are single-stranded, negative sense, enveloped RNA viruses and possess two membrane anchored glycoproteins involved in virus entry, one for host cell receptor attachment (G glycoprotein) and the other a fusion (F) glycoprotein which facilitates virion and host cell membrane fusion. The G and F glycoproteins are the major antigenic targets of neutralizing antibodies and also the focus of several vaccine strategies. In contrast however, antiviral drug discovery for HeV and NiV has been significantly hampered because of the requirements of biosafety level-4 (BSL-4) containment, and presently there is a complete lack of any effective antiviral therapeutics against henipaviruses for human use. We have been extensively characterizing the recently identified non-pathogenic species of henipavirus, Cedar virus (CedPV). Using recombinant viral glycoprotein mediated cell-cell fusion assays, we have discovered that CedPV-mediated membrane fusion is similar to HeV and NiV, however, the ephrin receptor tropism of CedPV was found to be remarkably broad and fusion could be triggered by ephrin- B1 and -B2 as well as the glycophosphatidylinositol-anchored A subtype ephrins-A1, -A2, and -A5. The cell- cell fusion activity supported by each of these ephrin receptors also correlated with CedPV G binding ability as measured by surface plasmon resonance. Further, we have recently rescued recombinant CedPV encoding eGFP (rCedPV-GFP) using a reverse genetics approach. Our rCedPV platform represents a new virological system that can be used in a variety of applications to study various aspects of henipavirus cell biology and host cell interactions safely under BSL-2 containment. But of further importance, it is also an authentic henipavirus infection and replication reporter system now suitable for high-throughput screening (HTS) for the discovery of potentially pan-anti-henipavirus molecules. Using this new live-henipavirus platform, our objectives here will be to develop and optimize a rCedPV reporter system and utilize it in an HTS assay to discover antiviral molecules capable of inhibiting the infection of henipaviruses. Specifically, we will: 1) Adapt and develop CedPV reporters for the HTS assay; 2) Optimize the HTS parameters of recombinant virus infection and reporter activities; and 3) Pilot a HTS assay using the Prestwick Chemical Library."
"9565338","Major Findings We have completed all data collection and have published the clinical findings which demonstrated significant changes after exercise on the speed of voluntary and involuntary balance reaction time. We have completed analyses of the fMRI task and found that there were significant changes after the exercise program in the brain regions that sub serve balance in this population and these changes were correlated with clinical improvements. We are currently preparing a manuscript on these results for submission.     Project Impact Statement This project has contributed to our fundamental understanding of brain injury and may lead to new treatments to enhance motor and/or psychological well-being and promote neural recovery in those with TBI. The use of fast speed elliptical training is based on recent evidence on the fundamental role of exercise in neural repair and recovery of function across multiple brain subsystems (motor, sensory, cognitive, emotional, etc.). This project also has strong relevance to the intent and mission of the CNRM which is to create bridges across federal institutional efforts to advance the scientific study of traumatic brain injury, with a specific interest in the potential for neural plasticity and recovery of pre-injury functioning.  This pilot project has lead to the design of a randomized clinical trial comparing this more moderate exercise to higher intensity aerobic exercise in individuals with TBI that is currently underway (new protocol)."
"9562827","The most widely accepted model addressing the source of PF pain is that a force imbalance in the muscles controlling the knee joint leads to static patellofemoral (PF) malalignment and dynamic PF maltracking. In turn, this malalignment and maltracking leads to elevated joint contact stresses, which ultimately leads to PF pain and potentially OA. This model has been substantiated by a recent study that demonstrated a direct correlation between the degree of pain at the PF joint and patellofemoral kinematics. In addition, studies focused on McConnell taping have consistently shown that by adding a medializing force through taping an immediate reduction in pain can be seen. Yet, the source of the force imbalance around the knee is still open to debate with some postulating the cause to be delayed timing in the vastus medialis oblique (VMO) muscle, imbalance in the passive structures, or a loss of strength in the VMO. Numerous studies refute these claims as well.   Therefore, the goal of this current protocol is to determine if a temporary immediate medialization of the quadriceps force can reduce excessive lateral shift and tilt in individuals with PF pain and by doing so provide immediate pain relief. This will be accomplished by using bupivacaine to create a short-term, instantaneous loss of function in the VL muscle in patients with PF pain. Bupivacaine is a local anesthetic which is closely related to lidocaine and commonly used for peripheral nerve blocks.  Cine-PC (CPC) MR imaging will be the primary measurement tool to assess the PF kinematics pre- and post-block. This is the only non-invasive technique that can accurately (<0.33mm) measure three-dimensional skeletal and muscular motion simultaneously. The two specific primary hypotheses and the secondary hypothesis to be addressed are: 1) A short-term loss of function in the VL in patients with PF pain will result in a reduction in their PF lateral shift and tilt; 2) A short-term loss of function in the VL in patients with PF pain will result in a reduction of pain; and 3) A short-term loss of function in the VL will result in a no change in the maximum isometric extensor strength of the quadriceps muscles. Ultimately, we hope to establish direct links between medialization of the quadriceps force, normalization of knee kinematics, and a reduction in pain.  In order to better understand potential confounding variables, this protocol plans to enroll 10 healthy control subjects prior to evaluating individuals with PF pain.  To date, five asymptomatic volunteers with no prior history of knee pain, trauma, leg surgery, or contraindications to having an MRI have been enrolled. For all subjects, the PF and tibiofemoral (TF) kinematics will be derived from dynamic cine phase contrast velocity data during the first visit. The subject will then be asked to return within a week for the second segment of the study. For the second visit, the subject's isometric strength and level of pain during various activities will be assessed first. Then, the vasti lateralis block will be performed using 1-5 cc of 0.5% solution of bupivacaine. After it has been confirmed that the block is effective, the subject's strength and level of pain will be reassessed. Following this, cine-phase contrast data will be again collected during a flexion-extension exercise in order to quantify the subject patellofemoral kinematics. A repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) will be used to test the null hypothesis that the post- and pre-injection kinematics were no different across the knee angles of extension. A Kolmogorov-Smirnov test for normality will be run. If the data are normally distributed a repeated measures ANOVA will be run using Hotellings T2 test statistic; if not, the non-parametric Friedman's test statistic will be used. Upon rejection of the null hypothesis a post-hoc analysis (Wilcoxon signed rank test) will be completed to determine at which knee angles the null hypothesis could be rejected. Pearsons correlations between the change in kinematics post-injection and the pre-injection kinematics will quantified at these same knee angles. This will followed by a step-wise linear regression. Significance is set at p less than or equal to 0.05.  This project remains in the data collection phase."
"9591098","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): As highlighted in the 'Bad Bugs, No Drugs' campaign by the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA), There simply aren't enough new drugs in the pharmaceutical pipeline to keep pace with drug resistant bacterial infections, so-called `superbugs'. Numerous hospitals worldwide have experienced outbreaks of infections caused by multidrug-resistant (MDR) Pseudomonas aeruginosa, one of the six top-priority dangerous ESKAPE microorganisms identified by the IDSA that require the most urgent attention to discover new antibiotics. Sadly, no novel antibiotics against MDR P. aeruginosa will be available for many years to come. Polymyxins (i.e. colistin and polymyxin B) are now being used as the `last-line' of therapy for infections caused by these very problematic MDR pathogens. Most unfortunately, the emergence of polymyxin resistance has been increasingly reported recently. In essence, resistance to polymyxins implies a total lack of antibiotics for treatment of life-threatening infections caused by these Gram-negative bacteria.         Research Design: Our research strategy includes R21 and R33 phases. The overall objective of this project is to harness inhaled bacteriophages as natural predators to combat the superbugs in respiratory infections. Our over-arching hypothesis is that inhalation delivery of phages as an aerosol will provide a safe and efficacious local treatment for MDR infections in the lungs. R21 phase includes two Specific Aims: (1) to produce novel phage powder formulations for inhalation aerosol delivery to the lungs, and (2) to establish the validity and utility of these phge formulations by physicochemical characterization and proof-of- concept efficacy study. If the specific milestones in R21 phase are met, the R33 phase will (1) elucidate the mechanism responsible for stabilization of phages in powder formulations, and evaluate the storage stability of the phage inhalation formulations [Specific Aim 3], and in parallel, examine the pharmacokinetics and potential toxicity of inhaled phage formulations [Specific Aim 4]. Finally, in vivo efficacy studies of inhaled phage formulations will be conducted using animal infection models [Specific Aim 5]. Together, these studies will identify the best phage formulation (plus one backup) for further pre-clinical pharmacological evaluations. As phages are already used clinically, there is great potential to rapidly translate our research findings to the clinic.         Significance: This project holds great promise for the development of a novel phage therapy for respiratory infections caused by MDR P. aeruginosa. Our inter-disciplinary approach will provide the fastest track and cost effective clinical solutions for inhaled phage therapy to combat the very problematic Gram-negative `superbug'. Overall, this project targets an urgent global unmet medical need and it aligns perfectly with the 2014 NIAID Antimicrobial Resistance Research Strategic Approaches."

"9481384","The HIV life cycle requires the export of intron-containing viral mRNAs from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. This process is ordinarily restricted by the cell, but HIV overcomes this check through the interaction of a viral protein, Rev, and an RNA secondary structure, the Rev-Response Element (RRE), found on intron-containing viral transcripts. Variation in the functional activity of the Rev-RRE axis has been observed in viruses taken from patients infected with HIV, but the clinical significance of that variation and its causal mechanism is not clearly understood. Previous studies of a related lentivirus clearly show that Rev-RRE activity variation plays a role in pathogenesis, strongly suggesting that this system is similarly important in HIV infection. It is hypothesized that the Rev-RRE regulatory axis functions as a rheostat which permits viral adaptation to different immune environments. In this K08 Mentored Clinical Scientist Research Career Development Award application, Dr. Patrick Jackson, a fellow in Infectious Diseases at the University of Virginia, proposes to perform a series of studies to illuminate the role of the Rev-RRE system in HIV transmission and in viral latency. First, using a novel high-throughput lentiviral vector assay of Rev-RRE functional activity, the role of this axis in HIV transmission will be examined by comparing Rev-RRE activity in transmitted and circulating viral quasispecies. Second, the Rev-RRE activity of latent proviruses and circulating viruses will be compared. High and low activity Rev-RRE pairs will be tested to see if they cause differences in viral replication kinetics and the production of viral proteins. This phenomenon could underlie the failure of ?kick and kill? strategies to cure HIV. Finally, domain swapping experiments will be performed to identify the sequence determinants of both Rev and RRE functional activity. Naturally occurring and chimeric Rev and RRE sequences will be utilized to identify key residues and structures. This research has direct implications for the development of improved pharmacologic prophylaxis for HIV transmission and for improvements in ?kick and kill? HIV cures. This research will be conducted at the University of Virginia under the mentorship of Drs. David Rekosh and Marie- Louise Hammarskjold who have a strong track record of training success. Dr. Jackson proposes a career development plan consisting of experiential learning; formal course work in molecular biology, bioinformatics, and grant writing; and structured research and professional mentorship. He proposes a specific timeline for presentation of results at international conferences and in peer reviewed publications, as well as a timeline for future grant applications. This program is designed to situate him as an independent researcher with expertise in HIV virology and a skill set which encompasses a broad set of scientific techniques."
"9549460","Three granulocyte donors were recruited since the last annual report. To date, 82 healthy volunteers were accrued and signed informed consent as active granulocyte donors and donated a total of 272 filgrastim- and dexamethasone-stimulated or  filgrastim-alone stimulated  granulocyte apheresis components since protocol started. 31 components were collected since last report.  Up to 8/8/17 this year , these products were administered to 6 patients with severe neutropenia or neutrophil dysfunction and life-threatening infections; 3 had chronic granulomatous disease and 2 were patients transplanted for leukemia and 1 had an IL1-receptor defect.  In total, 25  of 45 recipients had fungus or mold (an additional one could not be confirmed, and one of the patients had polymicrobial bacteremia in addition to fungus) and 19 had life-threatening bacterial infections, including two with carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumonia.   As was true this year, a median of 4 granulocyte transfusions (range 1 to 41) were administered per patient course since protocol inception. Since last annual report, 2 of 6 patients did not respond to the granulocyte transfusions (GTX) and died having received only 1 and 6 granulocytes transfusions each. The remaining 4 improved and were discharged having received a total of 24 GTX overall. Two CGD ( of the 6 patients) patients disountinued their course of GTX due to reactions/alloimmunizations. Donors experienced mild to moderate insomnia, nightmares, irritability and jitteriness related to the dexamethasone, and myalgia, arthralgias, fatigue and flushing related to the filgrastim administration. This year 14 donors underwent comprehensive eye exams for cataract detection as an assessment prior to repetitive dexamethasone administration. Donor retention in the program was 77%, with donor loss due to moving away from the Bethesda area or loss of interest. A mean of 7.2 liters were processed per procedure, during which 5.4 x 10e10 granulocytes (range 2.32-10.32 x 10e10) were collected in a volume of 335 mL. Granulocyte collection efficiency was only 39.1% using the Spectra apheresis device, with WBC differential composed of 87% granulocytes, and with a mean hematocrit of 12% and a mean red cell content of 39 mL.

"9565337","Major Findings:  We have now closed enrollment and are preparing manuscripts. The major findings were a significant and marked change in the speed with which children were able to perform the reciprocal leg exercise with approximately a third of those also having a clinically significant improvement in gait speed. (the change in gait speed for the group was not significant. A manuscript is currently in press that details these results.   Another important funding is that this group of patients showed greater than normal functional connectivity across the two sensorimotor hemispheres. After the exercise we found a correlation between the change in voluntary speed and the change in connectivity, such that those who had a greater change in speed, had a greater reduction of connectivity suggesting that the brain pathways improved and became more reciprocal instead of synchronized as a result of training. A manuscript is currently in preparation for submission.    Project Impact Statement:  This will be the first reported efficacy trial of both motor-assisted cycling and elliptical training in CP. Since reciprocal coordination improved as a result of training,these findings warrant further comparison with existing treatments such as BWSTT through clinical trials. This is also one of the few studies with pre-post intervention brain imaging results in children with bilateral cerebral palsy."
"9404371","Project Summary/Abstract: Cancer Epidemiology (CE)  The goal of the Cancer Epidemiology (CE) Program is to provide a platform to synergize research efforts of  epidemiologic and clinical researchers in order to elucidate pathways to cancer occurrence and progression  that can impact clinical treatment and prevention strategies. The program brings together experienced, NCI-  funded epidemiologists, molecular biologists, biostatisticians, bioinformaticists and NCCC clinicians around 3  central interactive program themes: (1) population genomics, (2) emerging risk factors, and (3) life course  epidemiology. Program investigators design, execute, and analyze population-based research aimed at  understanding cancer etiology, second malignancies, progression, and survival, as well as develop novel  methods for these lines of research. This work is based on outstanding efforts to use population-based studies  of the catchment area population and also to engage in research with national and international epidemiologic  resources, including clinical trials, cohort and case-control studies. Currently there are 22 members, including  3 clinical members and 1 joint member, spanning 11 departments with expertise and experience in all facets of  modern molecular epidemiology. The NCCC has been instrumental in supporting the efforts of the CE  program, most notably with its support of strategic, targeted recruitment efforts, including the recruitment of  Chris Amos, Olga Gorlova, Jennifer Doherty, Diane Gilbert-Diamond, Scott Williams, Amarendra Das, Zhigang  Li, Brock Christensen and Carmen Marsit, the latter who serves now as Co-Director of the program with  Margaret Karagas. Spurred by these recruitments and their synergies with existing member interests, the  present program has developed and evolved, from a broader program in Cancer Epidemiology and  Chemoprevention, to focus its efforts on cancer epidemiology research and translation. The program aims to  expand collaborative research efforts within its membership and across NCCC Programs, utilizing monthly  program meetings to encourage these activities, which are subsequently catalyzed by pilot grants funded by  NCCC. The support of the NCCC was paramount in the successful creation and funding of the new COBRE  Center for Molecular Epidemiology, the development of an interdisciplinary training program in the Quantitative  Population Sciences in Cancer, and a second COBRE in Integrative Biology. These initiatives have been  instrumental in the recruitment of talented faculty and trainees that continue to energize and grow cancer  epidemiology research. More than 580 cancer-related articles have been published over the reporting period  (85 [15%] in high impact journals), with all 22 members on intra-program (158=27%) and 19 members on inter-  program (74=13%) collaborations. Total funding for the program is currently $11.5M, of which $10.8M is peer-  reviewed and $2.9M is from NCI. These efforts will allow the CE program to continue to perform cutting-edge  molecular epidemiologic research, on the etiology and outcomes of cancer, to reduce the burden of human  malignancies and impact prevention and treatment strategies."
"9555574","With the exception of the presence of the FIP1L1-PDGFRA fusion gene, little is known about predictors of imatinib response in clinically-defined hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES). In this study, we have stratified HES patients according to their FIP1L1-PDGFRA mutational status and criteria suggestive of a myeloid neoplasm. The peripheral blood and bone marrow specimens were evaluated for dysplastic eosinophils on peripheral smear (abnormal nuclear lobation, uneven granulation, hypogranulation, agranulation), serum B12 level 1000 pg/ml, serum tryptase level 12 ng/mL, anemia and/or thrombocytopenia, bone marrow cellularity >80% with left shift in maturation, dysplastic (spindle-shaped) mast cells on bone marrow biopsy, evidence of reticulin brosis 2+ on bone marrow biopsy, and dysplastic megakaryocytes on bone marrow biopsy. Subjects with FIP1L1-PDGFRA-myeloid neoplasm (FP; n =12), PDGFRA-negative HES with 4 criteria suggestive of a myeloid neoplasm (MHES; n =10), or steroid-refractory PDGFRA-negative HES with <4 myeloid criteria (SR; n = 5) were enrolled in a prospective study of imatinib therapy. The primary outcome was an eosinophil count <1.5  109/L at one month and improvement of clinical symptoms. Clinical, molecular, and bone marrow responses to imatinib were assessed. In addition, a retrospective cohort of 18 subjects with clinically-defined HES who received imatinib (300-400 mg daily  1 month) were classified according to the criteria used in the prospective study. Overall results showed that imatinib response rates were 100% in the FP group (n = 16), 54% in the MHES group (n = 13) and 0% in the SR group (n = 16). The presence of  4 myeloid features was the sole predictor of response. After  18 months in complete remission, imatinib was tapered and discontinued in 8 FP and 1 MHES subjects. Seven subjects (6 FP, 1 MHES) remained in remission off therapy for a median of 29 months (range 14-36). In conclusion, clinical features of MHES predict imatinib response in PDGFRA-negative HES."
"9557290","PAROXYSMAL NOCTURNAL HEMOGLOBINURIA (PNH) is a clonal hematologic disorder caused by acquired somatic mutations in the phosphatidylinositol glycan class A (PIG-A) gene.  The product of this gene takes part in the biosynthesis of the glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor, a molecule that attaches numerous proteins to the cell membrane.  Because PIG-A gene mutation originates in  a multipotent hematopoietic stem cell with differentiation and self-renewal capacity, all progenitor cells deriving from the mutated HSC harbor the GPI defect, and have a complete or partial deficiency in the expression of GPI-anchored proteins (GPI-APs) on the cell surface. Some of these GPI-anchored proteins, such as CD55 and CD59, are regulators of the complement cascade, by interfering with the assembly of the terminal complement complex. In this manner, red blood cells of normal individuals are protected from complement-mediated destruction, whereas those deficient in anchored proteins such as CD55 and CD59 undergo hemolysis, predominantly intravascular. PNH is commonly associated with states of acquired bone marrow failure such as idiopathic aplastic anemia (AA) and myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS).  In AA, up to 60% of patients harbor small to moderate PNH populations, whereas in MDS, the prevalence of PNH clones is lower, 10-20%.  Evaluation of deficient expression of GPI-APs in PB cells by flow cytometry (FC) is currently the method of choice for the laboratory diagnosis of PNH. Although most flow cytometric analyses have focused on testing the expression of the two GPI-APs CD55 and CD59, a fluorescently labeled inactive variant of the protein aerolysin (FLAER) emerged as a superior method for PNH testing in granulocytes and monocytes. PB red and white cells have been extensively studied in this disorder but there have only been few efforts to delineate in detail the abnormalities of BM cells in these patients.  BM specimens are generally considered less suitable than PB owing to variable expression of GPI-APs during the various stages of hematopoietic cell development and are seldom studied for PNH evaluation.  However, BM aspirates from patients with unexplained cytopenias, including bone marrow failure syndromes, are frequently submitted to laboratories for general diagnostic purposes but targeted PNH analysis is seldom performed on these samples.   Specific goals of this project: 1. Analysis of fluorescently labeled aerolysin (FLAER) binding to bone marrow (BM) cells in normal volunteers and patients with primary marrow disorders such as aplastic anemia (AA) or myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) who have detectable PNH in the peripheral blood (PB). 2. Comparison of PNH clone size in BM and PB.  3. Detection of PNH in BM by antibodies routinely used for diagnosis and characterization of BM disorders in clinical laboratories.   Methods: Flow cytometry analysis of FLAER binding, and expression of CD55/CD59 inn conjunction with other antibodies in BM cells.   Preliminary Results: FLAER binds to all normal BM cells, except for erythrocytes. FLAER binding increases with cell maturation and reaches the highest level on mature elements. In PNH, the clone size is smaller in lymphocytes than in other BM cells.  PNH clone sizes in BM and PB are comparable, making BM equally suitable for PNH detection and quantitation.  With antibodies routinely used for general diagnosis (anti CD45, CD13, CD11b, CD64 and the anchored proteins CD16 and CD14) PNH clones can also be detected in BM mature neutrophils and monocytes with high specificity and sensitivity.

"9549462","Zika virus (ZIKV) is an Aedes species, mosquito-transmitted Flavivirus responsible for an ongoing epidemic in over twenty countries and territories in the Caribbean, and in North, Central and South America.  In addition to mosquito-borne transmission, ZIKV can likely be transmitted via blood transfusion and by sexual contact with a ZIKV-infected man. Other Flaviviruses, including yellow fever virus and dengue virus (DENV) are known to be transfusion-transmitted and have resulted in severe outcomes. Chikungunya virus (CHIKV), an alphavirus, has a high theoretical risk of transfusion-related transmission. The ZIKV, DENV and CHIKV infection rates are unknown among U.S. blood donors deferred either for travel to an endemic area or for sexual contact with a partner who travelled to an endemic area.  Further, the natural history of ZIKV, DENV and CHIKV among deferred blood donors is not well-defined.   Enrollment for this study began in mid June 2016 at the NIH Blood Bank, in the NIH Clinical Center Department of Transfusion Medicine.  To date, 25 travel-deferred or potential blood donors who traveled to Zika virus endemic areas have been enrolled and tested using highly sensitive and specific RT-PCR-based assays for ZIKV, DENV1-4 and CHIKV (Altona Diagnostics; under FDA emergency use authorization).  Enrollees have mean age of 40, 56% are female, 72% are white or Caucasian and 32% had been blood donors >10 years.  Donors and potential donors traveled to 23 different countries or territories with endemic Zika virus, including: Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, El Salvador, Mexico, Panama and Peru; in the Caribbean: the Bahamas, Dominican Republic, Jamaica, Martinique, Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands; elsewhere: India, Indonesia, Nigeria, Senegal, Singapore, Tanzania, UAE and Vietnam.    We performed internal validation of the ZIKV RT-PCR kit using clinical samples and determined a limit of detection of approximately 100 copies per mL.  Thus far, thirty-two of thirty-three deferred or potential blood donors were negative for ZIKV, DENV and CHIKV in plasma and urine.  One potential donor was positive for Chikungunya RNA in urine (negative in blood) >2 weeks after mild, CHIKV-related symptoms began during a visit to Ecuador. The patient attributed the mild CHIKV symptoms to strenuous volunteer work she was doing for an aid agency in Ecuador, and would not have been reported as an illness during blood donor screening.  We are in the process of procuring clinical samples for validation of our microarray-based pathogen chip for simultaneous ZIKV, DENV and CHIKV detection.  We anticipate collaboration with a large regional blood collection system who will refer travel-deferred donors, donors who have recently traveled to ZIKV, DENV and/or CHIKV high-risk areas and donors who have tested RNA positive for ZIKV, DENV, and/or CHIKV."
"9555580","Overview: This translational research program addresses molecular and pathophysiological processes of nociceptive transmission and new ways to investigate the potential confluence of chronic pain, autoimmune conditions, infectious diseases and their intersections in human patients. Chronic neuropathic pain can affect any part of the body and can occur due to a variety of insults, infections, and autoimmune or metabolic disorders (e.g., diabetic peripheral neuropathy). We are testing the hypothesis that, in some patients, chronic pain is initiated and/or maintained by immunopathological processes related to autoantibodies generated against proteins in peripheral nerve or Schwann cells or possibly components of the central nervous system. Autoantibodies are known culprits in certain large fiber paraneoplastic peripheral neuropathies. Where pain is a component, we hypothesize the presence of autoantibodies to proteins found in nerve endings arising from small diameter pain-sensing (nociceptive) C- or A-delta nerve fibers. To test the hypothesis that painful neuropathic conditions have an autoimmune component we established a sensitive, quantitative, liquid phase luminescence assay that uses recombinant protein antigen-luciferase fusions as tracers with expression in mammalian cells. The goals of this research are to understand (a) molecular and cell biological mechanisms underlying human chronic pain disorders, and (b) to use this knowledge to devise new treatments and diagnostics for pain and other disorders to which it can be adapted.   The methodology we established, luciferase immunoprecipitation systems (LIPS) assay robustly and sensitively detects antibodies in serum, plasma, cerebrospinal fluid or saliva. Our early investigations evaluated a range of diseases and disorders that antibodies play a role in, including infectious diseases with and without nervous system involvement and autoimmune disorders, which have nervous system symptomology in subsets of patients. In many neural autoimmune disorders, the major autoantigens are frequently plasma membrane receptors or ion channels. We are in the process of examining neuropathic pain disorders for targets based on published reports, notably the beta-adrenergic receptor and a potassium channel.  Our aim is to determine if the LIPS assay can detect auto-antibodies to these proteins in appropriate patients. We completed a study on shingles (herpes zoster) and patients in which shingles evolved into a painful neurological disorder called post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN). We detected some neutralizing anti-cytokine autoantibodies in a subpopulation and, interestingly, all of these had PHN. This is important because it suggests that some patients with PHN may require additional intervention to control the disorder other than just analgesic medications. In a recent publication we demonstrated both HSV1 transcripts and HSV1 antibodies in post-mortem  human trigeminal ganglion and whole blood, respectively.  The correspondence between titer and transcript was 100%.  The fact that we used RNA-seq allowed us to align the HSV1 reads to the HSV1 genome and all of the transcripts aligned with the HSV1 latency associated transcript (LAT), indicating that none of the subjects had viral re-activation at the time of death. We intend to use this approach as a component in a larger study of headache and migraine.   One of the most compelling aspects of this project is its broad applicability and the progressive layering and evolution of the datasets. As we increase the number of test antigens, and assay across conditions and diseases, we assemble comprehensive evaluations of immune and autoimmune responses. This is accomplished by determination of (a) the extent and specificity of immune response to orthologous proteins and protein fragments, (b) overlap in antigen profiles indicative of common denominators or general mechanisms, and (c) antigenicity within an entire signaling pathway involved in inter- or intracellular communication. Examples are the TRIM family of proteins in Sjogren's Syndrome, our autoantigen-based classification of patients with Lupus Erythematosis, and a recent examination of antibodies to oncogene products in HPV driven cancers. An example of a new use for public health monitoring is our earlier demonstration of autoantibody measurements in saliva, which highlights the feasibility of establishing non-invasive assays vulnerable populations or the pediatric population. Eventually, full multiple antigen profiling can be implemented to obtain a deeper level of understanding of the immune component of many complex human disease states."
"9535713","Project Summary  Clinical Protocol and Data Management (CPDM) is the administrative home for all of the units that support  clinical research at the Abramson Cancer Center (ACC), providing essential support for and monitoring of all  clinical research conducted in the ACC regardless of the type of intervention or sponsor. The CPDM, in  collaboration with ACC Leadership, creates, directs and enforces the operational standards (policies) and  expectations for the conduct of all clinical research within the ACC. The CPDM scope is of necessity broad,  encompassing development and updating of policies and procedures, education and training, supervision of  data managers and research nurses, and oversight over all of the specialty clinical research units within our  Center. The CPDM manages our centralized Clinical Trials Management System (CTMS), Velos, organizes  and performs quality assurance and QC/monitoring of clinical trials across the center, and directly manages the  complex, ongoing and recurring activities of our mandatory clinical research review committees. Key units  supported by the CPDM are the Department of Compliance and Monitoring (DOCM), the Protocol Review and  Monitoring System (PRMS, known as the Clinical Trials Scientific Review and Monitoring Committee  [CTSRMC]), the Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC), and the Clinical Research Unit (CRU).  While CPDM provides the administrative support for PRMS and DSMC, it is vital to note that these are, by  design, distinct entities. PRMS is described elsewhere in this renewal. The inclusion of Women and  Minorities in clinical trials is a central focus of ACC Leadership and clinical investigators as a component of  our commitment to addressing the cancer burden in minority and underserved populations. During the current  award period, the ACC implemented several initiatives aimed at reducing disparities in cancer incidence and  mortality in minorities, including completion of quality improvement training to further increase the diversity of  the patients on cancer clinical trials at ACC, establishment of additional key partnerships with community  organizations to increase educational efforts and community outreach, creation of cancer screening navigation  programs that increase patient engagement and improve access to and completion of cancer screening tests,  and recruitment of a cadre of patient navigators for common diseases in our catchment area affecting  minorities, including lung, colorectal and breast cancer, in order to assist patients from all backgrounds in  getting into our health care system and using it effectively. Children with cancer have traditionally had a very  high participation rate in clinical research studies with the field of pediatric oncology often at the forefront of  cancer clinical research. The ACC Pediatric Oncology Program has played a central role locally and nationally  in improving our understanding of the biology of childhood cancers through the collection and study of human  tumor specimens, and in advancing our knowledge of optimal treatments by conducting clinical trials and  playing a very notable leadership role in national pediatric cooperative group and clinical research consortia."
"9557292","Summary of studies using the transgenic rats in 2017: 1. Dopaminergic dysfunction in HIV transgenic rat: We have previously reported significantly decreased D2/3 receptors in the adult Tg rat brains compared to age-matched controls, in both the dorsal striatum (DS) and ventral striatum (VS), using 18F-fallypride PET imaging.  In younger animals, the decrease in D2/3 receptors was only significant in the DS, suggesting that there was a continuous trend of neurological/dopaminergic damage that worsens with age.  The combination of decreased TH that we saw on immunofluorescence (early step in dopamine synthesis) and decreased post synaptic receptor density (D2/3) seen on PET supported the notion of dopaminergic neuronal dysfunction/loss in this animal model. We concluded that 18F-fallypride can detect dopaminergic system dysfunction in the Tg rats and may be a reasonable imaging biomarker to evaluate neuroprotective approaches. We wanted however to further evaluate the pre-synaptic component of the dopaminergic system using another PET ligand, 18F-FP-CMT. Using two groups of rats (5-8 Month-old and 15-18 Month-old), we found that the 18F-FP-CMT and 18F-Fallypride binding potential (BPND) values were significantly lower in 15-18 month-old Tg compared to age-matched WT rats (p< 0.0001 and 0.001, respectively). 18F-FP-CMT BPND values in 5-8 month-old rats, however, were not significantly different. Longitudinal age-related decrease in 18F-FP-CMT BPND was exacerbated in the Tg rat.  We concluded that there is both presynaptic and postsynaptic dopaminergic dysfunction/loss in older Tg compared to WT rats. We believe this to be related to neurotoxicity of viral proteins present in the Tg rats serum and brain. 2. Role of oxidative stress in the neuropathology of the tg rat: HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND) continues to be a widespread problem, and progression of neurocognitive impairment caused by aging in individuals with HIV has been reported.  HAND is characterized by an increase in reactive oxygen (ROS), and reactive nitrogen species (RNS) at the cellular level. Motor and behavioral dysfunction are among the common symptoms and it is believed that oxidative and nitrosative stress contribute to mechanistic changes leading to neurocognitive impairment.  Our previous imaging, histological, motor and behavioral assessments support a dysregulation in dopaminergic function as the HIV-1 Tg rat ages.  The goal of this study was to demonstrate the presence of oxidative and nitrosative stress within the neuroanatomic areas associated with dopaminergic dysfunction in the HIV-1 transgenic (HIV-1 Tg) rat brain. We found pathology consistent with pre-synaptic dopaminergic neuronal loss, increases in striatal NADPH oxidase-4 (Nox4) and neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) expression with associated increase in 3-nitrotyrosine (3-NT) modified neurofilament proteins in the basal ganglia neurons of HIV-1 Tg rats compared to age-matched wild type rats. Those abnormalities were seen in the 9 month-old but not in the 3 month-old rats. Finally, this increase in free radical mediated neuronal pathology occurred without significant induction of the transcription factor Nrf2 and redox adaptation of the Nrf2 responsive thioredoxin and glutathione antioxidant system.  Our findings suggest that in the aging HIV-1 Tg rat, possibly due to chronic exposure to HIV-1 proteins and lack of appropriate redox adaptation, nitrosative stress and 3-NT modification of neurofilament proteins of basal ganglia neurons is hastened possibly contributing to structural changes to dopaminergic neurons and secondary dopaminergic dysfunction  Summary of studies using the SIV infected monkeys: 1. We hypothesized that 11C-DASB binding will be affected in SIV infection (with respect to pre-inoculation scans). We are using rhesus macaques infected with the neurovirulent SIV strain, SIVsm804E. We have finished acquiring PET imaging targeting SERT using 11C-DASB in monkeys before and after inoculation, in order to detect serotonergic system status under the effect of SIV infection. We found that the serotonin transporter (SERT) levels/expression increased in most animals (6 out of 7) that were inoculated with SIV when we compared the last time point imaging (11C-DASB PET) to the preinoculation scans. We are investigating a potential epigenetic effect of the virus on SERT expression at this point and preparing a manuscript. 2. We are also investigating the evolution of neuroinflammatory changes in the SIV-infected monkeys using peripheral viremia and disease control (simulating optimally treated HIV+ patients) as covariants. Towards this goal, we have finished acquiring 18F-DPA-714 PET imaging as biomarker of microglial activation (neuroinflammation), in vivo, in the SIV-infected monkeys. Unlike our expectations, we did not find increased translocator protein expression using 18F-DPA714 PET imaging in the monkeys (5 out 5 showing decreased binding after inoculation rather than increased binding). We believe this correlates to the severity of CNS involvement as measured by CSF viral load. We are now"
"9562829","While researchers have extensively reported on qualitative patterns of altered sensory processing in autism spectrum disorders (ASD), the neurobiological underpinnings of these alterations remain poorly understood.  Most importantly, it remains unknown whether the associations between social deficits, repetitive behaviors, and sensory dysfunctions are causally related or are due to shared underlying pathobiology.  The overall goal of this project is to elucidate the mechanism of altered nociception in animal models that recapitulate the core symptoms of ASD.  We will conduct mechanistic studies in well characterized autistic-like mouse models that harbor gene mutations known to be associated with increased risk for ASD.  We will also conduct preclinical evaluation of therapeutic agents that might improve sociability, repetitive behaviors, and at the same time possibly correct the altered nocifensive response.  The evidence that individuals with ASD have altered nociception, pain processing, and pain response is inconclusive.  In humans, others have shown that high-functioning adolescent with ASD have decreased thermal sensitivity (increased warmth and cold detection threshold) and that their thermal detection thresholds and heat pain thresholds correlates with their intelligence quotients.   In another study, high functioning ASD children were shown to have increased pain (lower pressure pain thresholds) and touch sensitivities (Von Frey monofilaments) compared to healthy children.   Using standardized questionnaires for the evaluation of behavioral responses to sensory stimuli, family members and care-takers answers indicate that in individuals with ASD, higher levels of tactile hypo-responsiveness and increased tactile seeking behaviors significantly correlates with increased social impairment and repetitive behaviors. Studies in animal models that recapitulate the social deficits and repetitive behaviors of ASD have increased our understanding of altered behavior and pain sensitivity in ASD.  Mice harboring gene mutations, known to be associated with increased risk for ASD, such as Mecp2 (a model of Rett syndrome), Shank2, Shank3 (a model for Phelan-Mcdermid syndrome), Fmr1 (a model for Fragile-X syndrome), offer a powerful combination of genetics, a mammalian brain, and the ability to quantify simple and complex behaviors like sociability and nocifensive response.  We are particularly interested in understanding the role of the nicotinic cholinergic system on the alterations of social behaviors and nocifensive response to noxious stimuli.  Multiple lines of evidence implicate the nicotinic cholinergic system on the pathobiology of behavior deficits in ASD.  Our recent findings in BTBR T+Itpr3tf/J (BTBR) mice, a well-studied model of ASD, further support this hypothesis and suggest that drugs targeting nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) may have a role in the treatment of behavior deficits in ASD.  We showed that nicotine, which activates and up-regulates nAChR subtypes particularly 42* and 7, has two distinct effects in BTBR.  Nicotine improves social deficits, at lower but not higher doses, and reduces repetitive behavior, at higher but not lower doses. These effects were observed with chronic nicotine administration and plasma levels within ranges achieved with nicotine supplementation therapies (nicotine patch). Together, these results implicate nAChRs in the pathobiology of behavior deficits in ASD and suggest that activation and/or desensitization of different nAChR subtypes and consequent modifications in cholinergic signaling and synaptic transmission were associated with the beneficial effects of nicotine on behavior deficits in BTBR.  Our findings also support using BTBR mice to screen therapies targeting nAChRs to modulate core ASD deficits.  We have also conducted studies to evaluate the role of the nicotinic cholinergic system on the nocifensive response on the BTBR mouse and on mice harboring Fmr1 null mutation (a model for Fragile-X syndrome).  By integrating the results from our two recent studies we are now evaluating the use of several drugs targeting nAChRs, which have a track record of safety and efficacy and are FDA-approved to treat neuropsychiatric disorders"
"9549480","Although the immunosuppressive drugs currently in use are effective in reducing the incidence of acute rejection after transplantation, they also put the patient at risk for life threatening infections and cancers. The long term administration of immunosuppressive agents results in an increase in both morbidity and mortality. In addition, the long term cost of these agents represents a financial burden.  Establishment of tolerance to a well-functioning transplant without nonspecific immunosuppressive drugs is a major goal of organ transplantation therapy. The induction of recipient (host) tolerance to the histocompatibility antigens of the organ donor could eliminate the need for long term administration of these nonspecific immunosuppressive drugs. This would have a major impact on the quality and quantity of life of patients with long term surviving organ grafts by reducing the immunologic and non-immunologic complications associated with long term immunosuppressive therapy.  Induction of immunotolerance in animal heart transplant models has for the most part involved donor-based tolerance. One well established model is injection of donor splenocytes plus a single injection of the T-cell supressing agents anti-rat lymphocyte serum or RIB 5/2. Adoptive transfer (altering the hosts immune system using lymphoid cells from another individual) of ex vivo generated alloantigen-specific regulatory T cells induces immunotolerance in a rat transplant model. This method has also been used in bone marrow transplantation and can be the basis for recipient-based immunotolerance induction. In heart transplantation, recipient-based immunotolerance induction is clinically more applicable than donor-based since donor genotype is rarely known prior to transplant. To date there is limited data on recipient-based immunotolerance induction in heart transplantation, but data exists from the bone marrow transplant literature.  In addition, although allograft tolerance has been achieved using a wide variety of donor-based immunologic interventions in laboratory animals, no reliable method of confirming tolerance following cardiac transplantation has been established. Standard of care in the field of solid organ transplantation remains initial treatment with triple immunosuppression followed by long term maintenance therapy with 1-3 immunosuppressive agents. One cannot withdraw drugs confidently even if the graft seems to be tolerant.   This study will apply high throughput expression profiling with the goal of studying donor and recipient-based immunotolerance induction protocols and identifying protein and gene changes that could serve as possible candidate biomarkers of tolerance. Identifying laboratory methods that will permit safe and precise confirmation of immune tolerance in the transplant patient has the potential to improve outcome substantially.  The protocol was approved in 2006 and a total of 403 rats were used over the duration of the protocol which was closed in 2012. The protocol was divided into 2 parts: Part 1 (recipient-based tolerance); and Part 2 (donor-based tolerance). In Part 1 (recipient-based tolerance), Stage 1 we were able to successfully generate Th2.rapa cells from recipient BN rats.  In Part 1, Stage 2 these adoptively transferred ex vivo generated BN Th2 cells were tested in culture using flow and cytokine phenotype tests, and an optimal rapamycin dose was determined.  In 2009, we completed studies in Part 1 Stage 3, which was designed to determine if Th2-shifted hosts (recipient-based tolerance) have reduced rejection.  In Part 2 (donor-base tolerance), Stage 1 (Induction donor-based tolerance) we successfully learned the techniques to remove the spleen of the rat (DA) that will donate the heart in stage 2.  We also successfully injected its processed splenocytes into the thymus of the rat (BN) that will receive the donor heart in stage 2.  In 2009, we completed studies in Part 2, Stage 2 which were designed to determine if donor-based tolerance induction reduces rejection.  In 2010, total RNA was prepared from peripheral blood mononuclear cells and used for high density oligonucleotide microarrays.  A manuscript was published in 2011 (PloS One, 6(4): e18885, 2011) establishing the ability of host-type Th2. Rapa cell therapy given pre-transplant to shift post-transplant cytokines towards a Th2 phenotype and prolong allograft viability when used in combination with a short course of cyclosporine therapy.  As mentioned above, in 2012 the protocol was closed; however, we continue to report on the project, since as new genomic techniques become available we may do further data processing and analysis of these completed studies and their stored samples."
"9402640","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a deadly disease, partially treated with pulmonary vasodilators. Emerging data suggest a potential role for insulin resistance in PAH. Both conditions are linked to chronic low- grade inflammation and monocyte (MNC) activation. However, direct measurements of insulin resistance in PAH patients have not been performed to date. Furthermore, the extent to which exercise and diet may improve PAH through the modulation of insulin sensitivity and inflammation has not been investigated. Our central hypothesis is that insulin resistance is a mediator of the disease process in PAH. We will test this hypothesis by pursuing the following Specific Aims: 1) Quantitate insulin sensitivity and body composition in PAH, and correlate with PAH severity. Indices of insulin sensitivity will be calculated using an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), and body composition will be measured by means of dual energy x-ray absorptiometry. These data will be correlated with PAH severity and mortality during a 2-3-year follow up. 2) Measure the inflammatory response of PAH-MNCs to hyperglycemia. Our working hypothesis is that insulin resistance elicits an enhanced inflammatory response in PAH. We will test this hypothesis by measuring the release of interleukin 6 and tumor necrosis-alpha by peripheral MNCs, both in the fasting state and after an oral glucose load. Aims 1 and 2 will include age-, gender-, and BMI-matched healthy controls. 3) Determine the extent to which improvements in insulin resistance via diet and exercise impact PAH. The working hypothesis is that improvement in insulin sensitivity might lead to improvements in PAH parameters through blunting of the inflammatory response. We will assess the impact of a 12-week exercise and low glycemic index Mediterranean type diet program compared to standard of care on insulin resistance, PAH indices of severity (echo estimated pulmonary pressure and right ventricular function) and monocyte- derived inflammatory cytokines, and in a proof-of-concept randomized study. The candidate has a strong clinical background in PAH, a track record of successful research endeavors with publications in major pulmonary journals, and a clear commitment and passion for patient-oriented research. The proposal's feasibility and success are predicated upon the large PAH population followed at the Cleveland Clinic; the one on one mentoring by Dr. Dweik, a PAH expert, and Dr. Kirwan, an insulin resistance expert; the collaboration with Dr. Barkoukis, an expert in diet interventions; and the CTSA Clinical Research Unit where the metabolic testing, diet counseling and exercise training will take place. The career plan includes didactic courses and guidance from a Mentoring Committee. The ultimate goal is to expand the applicant's research skills to allow a future career as an independent investigator able to conduct research that will directly benefit PAH patients."
"9557280","This protocol is designed to study the natural history and epidemiology of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in an asymptomatic blood donor population, to assess the potential for sexual transmission or other percutaneous transmission of HCV and to assess the clinical impact of acute or chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection superimposed on HCV infection.    To date, the primary study has enrolled 760 patients.  Of those 760 enrolled, 738 subjects have been analyzed, including 469 recombinant immunoblot assay (RIBA) positives, 52 RIBA indeterminates, and 217 RIBA-negative controls. The 15 year follow-up of the cohort was published in 2012(JID 2012:206:654). Interesting epidemiologic findings include the high proportion (41 percent) of RIBA+ donors who admitted to prior (remote) intravenous drug use and the strong independent association between cocaine snorting and HCV positivity. Shared paraphernalia for snorting accompanied by epistaxis, may serve as a covert vehicle for parenteral viral transmission. Among anti-HCV+/RIBA-positive donors, 82 percent were persistently viremic, but 18 percent appeared to have spontaneously recovered from prior HCV infection. A liver biopsy has been obtained from 185(47%) patients who were chronically infected; 51% had mild chronic hepatitis and 44% had moderate chronic hepatitis over a mean duration of infection of 20 years; only 5% had severe inflammation. No fibrosis was observed in 33% of biopsied patients and 52% had only mild fibrosis; 15 had more severe fibrosis including 12% with bridging fibrosis and 2% with cirrhosis. Overall, HCV infection in this cohort was generally asymptomatic and over the course of 25 years progressed to severe liver disease in approximately 15%. Despite an association of HCV with sexually promiscuous practices, we found no evidence for sexual transmission to the specific partners of 165 HCV-infected individuals. The study continues to follow the natural history of HCV infection and is now focusing on histologic progression as assessed in liver biopsies and fibroscans. New emphasis is being placed on studies of cell-mediated immune responses to HCV, neutralizing antibody responses, predictors of fibrosis progression, including performance of cytokine arrays, micro-RNAs and measurement of IL28 polymorphisms. Emphasis is now also being placed on treatment.New treatments with direct acting antivirals can effect greater than 90% cure rates, but the new drugs are expensive and not readily available. Our goal is to treat as many patients as possible and effectively cure most of the patients in this cohort. Thus far, 55 patients in this study have been treated to cure either with interferon based therapies or with new direct acting anti-virals.     In the current sexual partner arm of this study, we have enrolled 41 partners all of whom tested negative by both the initial screening test (EIA) and the specific HCV RNA PCR test.  Twenty-one (51.2%) of those 41 partners had previously tested negative with an average duration between testing of 12.8 years.  All partners were sexually active with index cases for at least 1 year and 71% never used any form of protective measure during sexual activity.   Since approval of the hepatitis B arm of this study, we have enrolled 3 HBV positive patients.  One patient had acute hepatitis B and was followed through her acute course to full recovery with treatment.  The second patient was hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and HBV DNA positive at enrollment, but soon after became HBV DNA negative without treatment, but continues to be HBsAg positive. The third patient was strongly positive for HBsAg and for hepatitis B core antibody (anti-HBc).  Further testing revealed that he was hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) negative and had very low level HBV DNA viral load and normal liver function (ALT) levels suggesting inactive infection. We continue to follow him on protocol and monitor his HBV DNA level and liver function."
"9396482","I have begun a program of research on the precipitants of change in personality traits that confer high risk for young adult problem drinking. This work has focused on the trait of negative urgency, the tendency to act rashly when distressed; negative urgency has been shown, in meta-analytic research, to relate more strongly than other impulsigenic traits to problem drinking (Berg et al., 2015; Stautz & Cooper, 2013), and, in prospective work, to predict the onset of, and increases in, drinking behavior (Riley et al., 2016). Using longitudinal designs, my colleagues and I have demonstrated that (1) very early onset drinking predicted subsequent increases in negative urgency, which in turn predicted yet further drinking, suggesting a positive feedback loop of prospective increases in both negative urgency and drinking (Riley et al., 2016); and (2) increases in negative urgency following early drinking behavior mediated the predictive impact of elementary school drinking on multiple negative high school outcomes, including increased drinking, smoking, and binge eating (Riley & Smith, in press). Recently, a co-sponsor of this proposed traineeship published evidence that a training program produced reductions in negative urgency in a small sample of women suffering from PTSD (Weiss et al., 2015). The scientific premise of this proposal is to test whether this training program produces (a) reductions in drinking behavior, (b) reductions in negative urgency among heavy drinking young adults, and (c) evidence that reduced negative urgency mediates the impact of the training on drinking behavior. I propose to test these hypotheses using a within-subjects laboratory design within a sample of heavy drinking young adults. A successful test will have direct implications for the prevention of heavy drinking behavior. Because negative urgency has been shown to increase risk transdiagnostically, findings may have implications for comorbid disorders and reducing other risky, impulsive behaviors as well. A key component of the training plan of this proposal is for me to receive training in conducting laboratory, experimental studies, because my work thus far has primarily involved longitudinal studies. Thus, the training plan includes: (1) training in the design and execution of laboratory, experimental studies; (2) training in how to conduct the negative urgency reduction training, which focuses on emotion modulation; (3) training in multilevel modeling: my planned program of research will involve studies of observations nested within people, nested within groups; (4) further advanced training in research ethics, including a second graduate course on ethical research with clinical populations and attendance at the University's clinical ethics grand rounds and research ethics lecture series; (5) preparation of research reports for publication, including learning how to respond effectively to revise and resubmit decisions; (6) presenting original research at leading, international scientific meetings; and (7) training in the mentoring of junior graduate students and undergraduate research assistants, including those assisting with the proposed research."
"9471644","ABSTRACT The global prevalence of soil transmitted helminth infections is estimated at two billion individuals infected, with an estimated 870 million children at risk of becoming infected. Helminth infections can lead to significant malnutrition, growth retardation, severe immunopathology, and exert enormous economic burdens on local communities. Helminth parasites take complex migratory cycles through multiple tissues before entering the intestine of their host. To combat these challenges, the mammalian immune system has evolved mechanisms to maintain a delicate balance between promoting beneficial inflammation needed to reduce parasitic burdens and limiting pathologic inflammation to maintain tissue integrity. The importance of maintaining this balance is evident by the severe pathology that presents in patients exhibiting dysregulated immune responses to helminths. Despite the importance of balancing protective and pathologic responses in the context of helminth infections, the cellular and molecular events that regulate these pathways remain unknown. It is well established that T helper type 2 (TH2) cytokine responses, characteristics of helminth-induced immunity in humans and mice, are required to both promote worm clearance and limit infection-induced tissue damage. An emerging body of literature has now shown that type 2 cytokine-activated macrophages operate as critical regulators of these distinct pathways. In addition, our recent work has also demonstrated that interactions between neutrophils and lung macrophages are required for macrophages to acquire anti-Nippostrongylus brasiliensis (Nb) effector functions in the airways. Moreover, our preliminary data suggest that interactions with basophil populations are required for macrophages to initiate wound healing responses in the lung. Collectively these studies provide the hypothesis that coordinated interactions with Nb-primed innate immune cell populations are necessary for macrophages to acquire host-protective effector functions. This will be directly tested in Aim 1 of this proposal focused on interrogating the accessory cells necessary to promote macrophage activation in the lung following Nb infection. It is well established that long-lived tissue-derived macrophages (TD-Macs) populate the lungs during fetal development, while monocyte-derived macrophages (Mo-Macs) accumulate in tissue environments in the context of ongoing inflammation. Further, it has been demonstrated that TD-Macs and Mo-Macs can exhibit distinct phenotypes in the context of helminth infections. Despite these advances the distinct contributions of TD-Macs and Mo-Macs to anti-helminth immunity and tissue integrity remain unknown. This will be directly tested in Aim 2 of this proposal focused on elucidating the distinct and common effector functions of lung macrophage populations following Nb infection. These aims will be addressed employing the collective intellectual and scientific resources of the Siracusa and Gause laboratories and the results of these studies will increase our understanding of how pulmonary macrophages are programed in the context of acute inflammation."
"9447640","PROJECT SUMMARY (ABSTRACT) Helicobacter pylori is a Gram-negative bacterium that colonizes the gastric mucosa of humans. Although most H. pylori-infected persons remain asymptomatic, potentially serious sequelae of infection include gastric adenocarcinoma, duodenal or gastric ulceration, and gastric lymphoma. Gastric cancer is the third leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide, and H. pylori has been classified as a type I carcinogen by the World Health Organization. One of the major secreted proteins of H. pylori is a toxin known as VacA. There is a high level of genetic variation among vacA alleles from unrelated H. pylori strains, and the encoded VacA proteins exhibit marked differences in their ability to cause alterations in human cells. A large body of literature indicates that H. pylori strains containing certain forms of vacA (termed s1, i1, or m1) are associated with a higher risk of gastric cancer or peptic ulcer disease than are strains containing other forms of vacA (termed s2, i2, or m2). Thus, VacA is considered to be an important H. pylori virulence factor. Most cellular effects of VacA are dependent on its ability to oligomerize and form anion-selective membrane channels, but relatively little is known about the molecular basis for these two critical steps in the VacA mechanism of action, and almost nothing is known about the roles of VacA oligomerization and pore formation in vivo. Therefore, the specific aims are to (i) elucidate the process by which VacA assembles into oligomeric structures; (ii) elucidate the process by which VacA inserts into membranes to form anion-selective channels, and (iii) define the consequences of VacA oligomerization and membrane channel formation in animal models. This work is relevant not only for the study of H. pylori-associated diseases, but will also increase our understanding of bacterial pore-forming toxins, chloride-conducting membrane channels, and ?-helical passenger domains secreted by an autotransporter pathway."
"9412191","Abstract Pneumonia caused by host-adapted, multiple drug resistant bacterial pathogens is a major clinical problem, associated with both primary infections and complications of hospitalization. Much of the pathology associated with these pathogens is due to the host response that is elicited ; either excessive inflammation that causes respiratory failure or an immunosuppressive response that permits unimpeded bacterial replication, pulmonary damage and sepsis. Organisms such as MRSA, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella pneumoniae readily adapt to the milieu within the human airways, acquiring mutations that affect their metabolism, immunogenicity as well as their resistance to antimicrobial agents. The goal of our studies is to apply a comprehensive approach to fully characterize such host adapted pathogens, isolated from patients, by using whole gen ome sequencing, murine modeling of immunogenicity, and proteomics. This type of analysis can provide the data necessary to identify bacterial components associated with specific patterns of infection. Bacterial genes that are linked to immuno-pathogenicity can be identified in clinical isolates in real time, just as methicillin resistance genes are routinely screened in staphylococci. A better understanding of the host response that is elicited will be used to apply immunomodulatory therapy to complement the often ineffective antimicrobial agents used to treat pneumonia. In other branches of medicine, targeting the inflammasome, IL-1, T cell signaling and TNF cascades have become standards of care and new immune targets are under active development. A comprehensive understanding of both the properties of the infecting organism and the host response that is evoked can be used to develop a strategy of precision medicine for the treatment of bacterial pneumonia."
"9493944","The overall objective of our research program is to understand how leukocytes migrate into inflamed tissues so that new therapeutic strategies can be developed to treat inflammatory diseases. One of the fundamental processes of inflammation is the directed migration of leukocytes into target organs following a gradient of chemokines or pathogen products, a process called chemotaxis. Blocking chemotaxis alone is effective for treating human inflammatory diseases. However, how leukocytes sense and follow chemical gradients is not well understood. This application is inspired by our recent discovery that leukocytes deficient in the TIPE (tumor necrosis factor-a-induced protein 8-like) family of proteins are ?compassless?, and non- polarizable: they are unable to polarize or migrate towards chemoattractants or into nervous tissue to cause inflammation despite their normal motility. The TIPE family are ?professional? transfer proteins of the phospholipid second messengers PIP2 and PIP3, and risk factors for both inflammation and cancer. We initially cloned the TIPE2 gene from the spinal cord of mice with autoimmune encephalomyelitis and found that it was preferentially expressed by leukocytes. We then generated TIPE2-deficient mice and found that they were significantly resistant to neural inflammation. Unexpectedly, TIPE2-deficient leukocytes have no defects in motility or activation, but are severely compromised in their directionality, i.e., the ability to sense and follow the gradient of chemoattractants. We therefore propose that the TIPE family is the long-sought-after compass of leukocytes that confers polarity and directionality during inflammation. In this proposal, we will test the hypotheses that TIPE proteins (i) direct leukocytes into nervous tissue during inflammation and (ii) polarize leukocytes through the mechanism of local excitation and global inhibition."
"9414507","ABSTRACT Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is an iatrogenic severe prothrombotic disease caused by an immune response to complexes of platelet factor 4 (PF4) and polyanions, such as heparin, accompanied by mild- moderate thrombocytopenia. We have studied the biological basis of this prothrombotic state in vitro using a novel human endothelial-lined microfluidic system, and in vivo, using a HIT model focused on mice that are transgenic for both human (h) PF4 and FcgRIIA. We found that in both, PF4 released from platelets followed by HIT-associated antibodies (HIT Abs) bound predominantly to the perithrombus endothelium. These endothelial-bound complexes propel thrombus growth and extension. Additionally, we found that PF4 enhanced neutrophil binding to injured endothelium and caused activated neutrophils to extrude its chromatin termed neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). NETs were compacted by PF4, enhancing their resistance to digestion by DNase. HIT Abs bound to these compacted NETs, further enhancing their DNase resistance. We propose that this sequence of events contributes to the intense prothrombotic sequelae of HIT and resistance to anti-thrombotic therapy. We will now further pursue these observations: Specific Aim (SA) #1: Understanding the role of the endothelium in HIT. We showed that PF4 released from platelets binds preferentially to injured perithrombus endothelium concurrent with loss of its heparan-sulfate-rich glycocalyx. It is unclear how endothelial injury with loss of glycocalyx increases PF4 binding. This unexpected increase will be pursued in the microfluidic system and in mice with genetic defects in glycocalyx formation. Strategies to attenuate the prothrombotic nature of HIT directed at the endothelium will also be pursued. SA#2: Understanding the role of neutrophils in HIT. PF4/HIT Abs complexes augment neutrophil adhesion to injured endothelium in vitro. In addition, in situ studies in HIT mice show enhanced neutrophil adhesion to thrombi in HIT and formation of neutrophil/platelet hetero-aggregates in hepatic vessels. These observations suggest important role(s) for neutrophils in HIT. We will extend the in situ studies of neutrophils in HIT to other target organs and we will study neutropenic HIT mice to confirm the importance of neutrophils to HIT- associated thrombosis and thrombocytopenia. We will test whether adhesion of neutrophils via P-selectin and its ligands mediate these observations and whether blocking this pathway ameliorates the thrombosis and/or thrombocytopenia. SA#3: Understanding the role of NET-release (NETosis) in HIT. We posit that PF4/HIT- Ab-stabilized NETs are highly prothrombotic. We have begun to test this concept in vitro and in vivo using HIT mice that cannot undergo NETosis, and will also measure soluble markers released from NETs in HIT. Thus, this proposal focuses on the roles of the endothelium and neutrophils in the development of HIT, and may lead to novel therapeutic approaches to complement current anticoagulant therapies. We also believe that insights gained from these studies may be applicable to other proinflammatory, prothrombotic disorders."
"9549540","Invasive B. anthracis infection is a relatively rare but highly lethal infection in humans. Production of lethal and edema toxin are believed to be central to the pathogenesis of B. anthracis infection. Due to the infrequency of invasive B. anthracis infection, but its potential use as a weapon of bioterror, the FDA permits the evaluation and approval of adjunctive therapy of this infection based on studies performed in at least two clinically relevant animal models. To what extent models that have been used to date to test anti-toxin agents have simulated the conditions encountered in patients presenting with invasive anthrax infection is unclear. Also, whether the effectiveness of anti-toxin agents is influenced when conditions do approach those encountered clinically (e.g. treatment after infection has manifested itself and in combination with other therapies) has not been investigated. To address these questions we are performing a systematic review of the literature and a meta-analysis of all preclinical models employing live B. anthracis challenge and testing anthrax anti-toxin treatments with or without accompanying antibiotic support.

"9555579","Overview: This research program addresses basic molecular and physiological processes of nociceptive (pain-sensing) transmission in the peripheral and central nervous systems (CNS) and new ways to effectively control pain. The molecular research is performed using animal and in vitro cell-based models. We concentrate on primary afferent pain-sensing neurons located in dorsal root ganglion (DRG) that send nerve fibers to skin and deep tissues and make connections within dorsal spinal cord, which is the first CNS site of synaptic information processing for pain. The mechanisms of transduction of physical pain stimuli are investigated through models of pathophysiological damage or using reductionist preparations such as primary DRG cultures or heterologous expression systems of ion channels or receptors. Our goals are (a) to understand the molecular and cell biological mechanisms of acute and chronic pain at the initial steps in the pain pathway, (b) to investigate mechanisms underlying human chronic pain disorders, (c) to explore neuronal plasticity and altered gene expression in persistent pain states, and (d) to use this knowledge to devise new treatments for pain.  New Treatments for Pain: We address the new treatment goal through translational research coupled with human clinical trials to develop and introduce new molecular interventions for severe pain. Studies with the TRPV1 agonist resiniferatoxin (RTX) have resulted in a Phase I clinical trial for in patients with intractable pain from advanced cancer. RTX activates TRPV1, which is an inflammation-, heat-, and capsaicin-sensitive calcium/sodium ion channel that normally converts painful heat or acidic pH into nerve action potentials by opening the pore of the ion channel. The influx of ions depolarizes pain-sensing nerve endings and sends electrical signals to the spinal cord (which in turn sends the signals to the brain where we perceive pain). After binding to TRPV1, RTX props open the ion channel, causing intracellular calcium cytotoxicity. Depending on the route of administration this disables or deletes TRPV1 pain-sensing neurons, their nerve endings or axons (i.e., the nerve fiber). RTX produces very effective pain control in pre-clinical models. The central route involves administration into the cerebrospinal fluid around the spinal cord (intrathecal). After approval of the clinical protocol by our IRB and the Investigational New Drug application by the FDA, we have treated 12 patients with pain from advanced cancer. This study is nearly complete. We also published a study of injections around or directly into sensory ganglia, and, based on this approach, we will commence a new protocol for more localized cancer pain problems. Peripheral routes of RTX administration include direct injection into skin, joints, nerve bundles, or topically. Analgesia by these routes is long-lasting but temporary since nerve endings and axons regrow. Peripheral administration formed the basis of three reports, one in which we successfully treated experimental burn pain, another in which we successfully used RTX as a preemptive analgesic for surgical incision pain and a third report (in progress) in which we successfully treated clinical osteoarthritis (OA) pain by intraarticular injection in client owned dogs. The canine results demonstrated strong efficacy and a long duration of action (4 to >12 months) upon RTX injection into knee joints and strongly reinforce the objective of therapeutic use of vanilloid agonists for pain control and the translation to human patients.    Early Translational Investigations: In collaboration, we have also examined the pharmacological activity of polyunsaturated ethanolamines and linoleic acid metabolites.  These putative endovanilloids. could function as endogenous orthosteric agonists at TRPV1. In this cycle, we evaluated tissue biosynthetic pathways for new endogenous lipids. We published our discovery of two previously unknown lipids. One sensitized nerves to nociceptive stimuli, the other caused itch and, in humans, were associated with headache and itch conditions, respectively. In ongoing allied studies, we examined small chemicals that act as positive allosteric modulators (PAMs) of TRPV1 activation. By high throughput screening we discovered several new chemical compounds that enhance the activation of TRPV1 upon orthosteric agonist (capsaicin) binding or by elevated H+ ions. Medicinal chemistry efforts yielded DPM-32 and DPM-74, which are active in in vivo or in vitro assays. These experiments reveal a new approach to pain modulation and pain control and support the idea that TRPV1 agonist activity, induced in several different ways, has the potential to yield novel, non-narcotic, non-addictive, selective, long-lasting analgesic agents that may be effective in acute, persistent, or chronic pain disorders. During this cycle we also published a report on a protein therapeutic agent that is a conjugate between Substance P and a bioengineered Pseudomonas exotoxin.  This agent is endocytosed by the substance P receptor expressing second order spinal cord dorsal horn neurons and the exotoxin moiety stops protein synthesis thereby killing the neuron and interrupting the pain pathway to the brain. This is a potent analgesic agent. We intend to test it in certain pain indications, including cancer pain and spinal cord injury pain. Molecular manipulations aimed at generating high expressing constructs are in progress.   Basic Pain Mechanisms: Underlying the translational and clinical studies are investigations of molecular biology, neuronal function, behavior, and mechanisms of pain transduction. We are systematically investigating molecular alterations at the first three steps in the pain pathway beginning with injured peripheral tissue, the dorsal root ganglion and the dorsal (sensory) spinal cord in order to obtain a foundational, comprehensive, quantitative molecular understanding of nociceptive processes related to inflammation and nerve injury. Our studies reveal a complex, dynamic modulation of gene expression at all three steps. We are using a method called RNA-seq to sequence all of the mRNAs in a given tissue or cell population and have identified prominent roles for new, key molecules with distinct combinatorial patterns of expression among the three tissues. We also combine RNA-seq with genetically or pharmacologically manipulated mice and rats and in humans with copy number variants that affect pain sensitivity, one being a hemideletion on chromosome 11 and the other a duplication on chromosome 7. The results are both compelling and informative, and define previously unidentified genetic components governing pain sensitivity. We also have used RNA-seq to define genes involved in inherited peripheral neuropathies and pain channelopathies. These investigations provide a much better quantitative assessment of genes expressed in tissues and neurons of the nociceptive circuit in basal conditions, after pathophysiological manipulations, and in human genetic variations that affect pain sensitivity. Through this basic research we aim to obtain a deeper understanding of mechanisms that trigger acute pain and sustain chronic pain and to identify molecular components to control pain."

"9392160","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) is a leading cause of kidney failure and end stage renal disease, and brings a substantial burden of early mortality and accompanying health care costs. Genetic factors contribute to the risk of DKD. If we could identify these genetic factors, we could better understand the mechanisms by which DKD occurs, and thereby accelerate the development of better therapies. We established the GENIE consortium, a collaboration between Queen's University Belfast, University of Dublin, University of Helsinki, and the Broad Institute. Together, we completed the largest genetic study to date of DKD, and successfully identified the first two robust genetic risk factors for DKD. In a separately funded genetic study, we are collaborating with additional groups to extend our efforts and encompass larger samples. To better understand the underlying biology and pathophysiology of DKD, we propose to complement and build on our past and ongoing genetic studies in several critical ways. We will leverage a co-funding mechanism between Ireland, Northern Ireland and the US to carry out a multidisciplinary investigation of DKD. We will assemble and jointly analyze all available genetic data pertinent to DKD, to begin the process of discovering rarer variants with stronger effects on DKD. We will also generate DNA methylation data in kidney and blood, and in patients with and without DKD, and also expression data in samples relevant to DKD. We use a novel and powerful method to integrate the genetic, epigenetic and genomic data to generate hypotheses about the biological causes of DKD, and test these hypotheses with further genetic studies (sequencing in a large follow-up sample) and with functional studies in models of DKD. This international, multidisciplinary collaboration will build on genetic discoveries to help decipher the underlying biology and pathophysiology of DKD and thereby guide the prevention and treatment of this important disease."
"9579802","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Satiety hormones such as glucagon-like peptide-1 (Glp1) are secreted in response to feeding and activate neural processes that subsequently suppress food intake. While the satiety effects of Glp1 have been known for over 15 years, the mechanism mediating this effect is not clearly defined. This is significant since some Glp1-based therapies for type 2 diabetes display modest weight loss effects. Understanding how Glp1 regulates food intake may, therefore, lead to the design of therapeutic interventions with improved efficacy for weight loss. Based on our preliminary data, we hypothesize that the anorectic effect mediated via the central Glp1 receptor (Glp1r) is integrated with hypothalamic signaling proteins that respond to changes in circulating glucose. Activation of the hypothalamic Glp1 receptor (Glp1r) inhibits the cellular energy sensor AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). Considering that the anorectic effects of leptin, insulin and glucose are mediated in part by inhibition of hypothalamic AMPK, we hypothesize that this is also a mechanism by which Glp1 suppresses food intake. We also show that inhibition of AMPK by the Glp1r agonist Exendin-4 (Ex4) in hypothalamic cell lines occurs only with increasing glucose concentration. Ex4 also stimulates glucose uptake and metabolism in a glucose concentration-dependent manner. Since increased glucose metabolism inhibits AMPK, we hypothesize that central Glp1r activation inhibits AMPK and subsequently reduces food intake by stimulating central glucose metabolism. Supporting this hypothesis, we show that inhibition of glycolysis in the brain blocks the anorectic effect of Ex4.  Contrasting the effects of glucose, central administration of fructose attenuates the anorectic effect of Ex4. Fructose activates hypothalamic AMPK. This suggests that by activating hypothalamic AMPK fructose can short-circuit the Glp1r signaling pathway and promote central Glp1 resistance. This could partially explain our observation that mice fed a sucrose diet, which provides fructose and glucose, eat more compared to mice fed an isocaloric starch diet that only provides glucose. This also has clinical implications based on the association between increased fructose consumption and the obesity epidemic, particularly in children.  Since the Glp1r is expressed in multiple hypothalamic nuclei, the first aim is to identiy hypothalamic regions mediating the anorectic effect of Glp1r agonists. The second aim will combine hypothalamic nuclei- specific modulation of the Glp1r with pharmacological agents that target processes we hypothesize are downstream of the Glp1r - glucose metabolism and AMPK activity. The final aim will assess whether dietary fructose is an inhibitor of the satiety effects mediated by central Glp1r activation.  The long-term goal of this application is to elucidate the mechanisms that regulate multiple aspects of feeding behavior. Defining the mechanisms by which the central Glp1r regulates food intake will identify key control points that could be sites for disruption by obesogenic factors and targets for therapeutic intervention."

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): To provide optimal HIV treatment and prevent new infections among women and adolescent girls in Kenya, it is necessary to conduct locally relevant research that addresses the know-do gap and can be readily translated into national guidelines, clinical practice and policy. The proposed training program's primary goal is to build capacity at the Kenya Medical Research Institute (KEMRI) in implementation science focused on HIV, women and adolescents while creating bridges to other organizations responsible for healthcare practice and service delivery. KEMRI's strong commitment to conducting research that informs service delivery and improves national health outcomes in Kenya forms the foundation for the program. This foundation is strengthened by the University of Washington's (UW) long-term collaboration with KEMRI and other Kenyan institutions, such as the National AIDS and STD Control Program (NASCOP). The program will be led by Dr. Carey Farquhar, UW Professor of Medicine, Epidemiology and Global Health, and Director of two large HIV training programs in Africa, and by Dr. Elizabeth Bukusi, an obstetrician-gynecologist with extensive research experience who is currently Deputy Director of Research and Training at KEMRI. The first aim of the proposed program will build implementation science research capacity at KEMRI and NASCOP by training 8 medical doctors in master's and doctoral programs offered by the UW School of Public Health. After 9 months of coursework in Seattle, trainees will return to Kenya for 9 months to conduct implementation science research projects focused on HIV treatment and prevention for women with guidance from a team of UW, KEMRI and NASCOP Core Faculty. During this period they will also complete an externship at the Kenya Ministry of Health, CDC-Kenya, or another governmental or non-governmental organization working in HIV care and prevention for women and adolescents. The program's second aim will further strengthen capacity at KEMRI by supporting medium-term training for 5 faculty who have excelled in teaching and research at the graduate school. After 5 months at UW, faculty will return to KEMRI equipped to teach new courses in advanced research methods, implementation science and adolescent and women's health and having completed a grant proposal or manuscript related to women and HIV. The third aim will extend the reach of training to a greater number of KEMRI and NASCOP staff by providing 1-week workshops on implementation science, grant writing, and manuscript preparation; 1-day workshops for county medical directors will also be offered in collaboration with KEMRI staff to promote engagement of local care, treatment and prevention leaders in areas where women are hardest hit by the HIV epidemic. This three-tiered approach uses UW's well-established approaches to training, the proposed program to build greatly needed implementation science research capacity at KEMRI and its partner organization NASCOP and change the face of the HIV epidemic for women and adolescent girls in Kenya."

Recently, coding region polymorphisms (G1 and G2) in the apolipoprotein L1 (APOL1) gene has been identified that can explain this increased risk. According to recent reports, there are more than 3 million African Americans with high-risk genotype, who are at increased risk for kidney disease development. Interestingly, mutations of APOL1 can present with diverse phenotypes, including patients with hypertensive nephrosclerosis (HN) presenting with low-grade albuminuria or patients with focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) and HIV associated renal disease (HIVAN) showing nephrotic syndrome. APOL1 is an HDL associated protein in the circulation, but glomerular and tubule epithelial cells, endothelial cells and vascular smooth muscle cells also express APOL1. APOL1 is a relatively recent gene and it is not present in rodents. Animal model studies proving that APOL1 is the causal gene for kidney disease development is lacking. The aim of the proposal is to understand APOL1-Associated Kidney Disease (AAKD) development. Aim1. A. Provide decisive evidence that APOL1 risk variants compared to the reference allele cause kidney disease B. Demonstrate that our cell type specific inducible mouse model system recapitulates human disease at a functional, histological and molecular level. C. Determine the critical cell type(s) for APOL1-mediated disease development by characterizing the phenotype of transgenic mice with podocyte, tubule epithelial cell, liver, endothelial and vascular smooth muscle specific inducible G0, G1 and G2 APOL1 expression. Aim2. Define whether lowering risk allele APOL1 levels can stabilize or reverse kidney disease Aim3. Understand the transcriptional regulation of APOL1 in podocytes Examine whether transcriptional suppression of APOL1 by STAT inhibitors can reduce APOL1 expression and ameliorate the mutant protein induced cytotoxicity. The studies shall have a broad significance, as APOL1 mutations might be the most common genetic cause of glomerulosclerosis; including FSGS."
"9549449","Persons with hemochromatosis were recruited via Internet-based educational and referral information and by letters to area physicians. Comprehensive care and phlebotomy therapy were offered free of charge regardless of whether subjects met criteria for allogeneic donation. Hemoglobin of 12.5 g/dL(for females) 13.0 g/dl (for males), the regulatory thresholds for blood donation in the U.S., were used as the thresholds for performing phlebotomy, and decreases in the mean corpuscular volume (MCV) and ferritin were used to guide the endpoints of therapy.  548 subjects with iron overload were enrolled as of June 30, 2017. 67% of subjects were homozygous for the C282Y mutation in the HFE gene, 69% met eligibility criteria for allogeneic donation, and 56% were previous blood donors. A median of 25 weekly or biweekly phlebotomies (range 7-99) were performed before the ferritin reached the targeted endpoint of 50-150 mcg/L. The median phlebotomy interval necessary to keep the ferritin at this level during maintenance therapy was 20 weeks.  Hemochromatosis donations were safe: no incident seroconversions for agents of transfusion-transmissible disease occurred during 9937 donations made by HH donors from 2002 through 2017.  As of June 30,2017 hemochromatosis donors were contributing 537 units of red cells yearly, resulting in a contribution of 10.8% of the units collected for allogeneic use in the NIH Clinical Center, and 105 units per year distributed for research use to NIH investigators from HH donors who did not meet standard allogeneic eligibility criteria. Family member screening and counseling were facilitated by concentrating the care within the Blood Center.  Our data demonstrate that hemochromatosis subjects can safely and significantly augment the allogeneic blood supply. Provision of phlebotomy therapy in the Blood Center, unrestricted by considerations of insurance reimbursement or suitability for donation, can improve access to care and remove incentives for incomplete risk disclosure.  Evaluations performed to date in this cohort indicate that there is a higher than expected incidence of thyroid abnormalities in hemochromatosis subjects, most commonly subclinical hypothyroidism. Thyroid function abnormalities were found in 28% of female subjects with homozygosity for the C282Y  HFE mutation. A series of cardiology studies in these patients indicated that C282Y homozygotes have a statistically increased incidence of mild, subclinical abnormalities in atrial contractility and exercise-associated arrhythmias when compared to normal subjects, and these changes may be associated with elevated serum markers of oxidative stress. Left ventricular contractility and response to stress were found to be normal in C282Y homozygotes compared with control subjects.  A comprehensive analysis of arthritis in these subjects revealed that 11.8% (43/363) C282Y-homozygous versus 2.2% (4/180) non-homozygous subjects underwent a total of 44 total hip, 21 total knee, and 10 total ankle replacements. The frequency of total joint replacement was significantly greater in C282Y-homozygotes than in the control group. The cumulative risk of total joint replacement hemochromatosis subjects was 31%.  Among C282Y homozygotes, the risk of total joint replacement was markedly greater in subjects with initial ferritin levels greater than the median value of 735 mcg/L.  Among the estimated 23,966 Caucasian U.S. males age 40-79 undergoing total hip replacement each year, the data suggest that 3-4% are C282Y-homozygous."

Additionally, IPIM oversees large-animal imaging instrumentation, including MRI, CT,  fluoroscopy/angiography, and ultrasound; all necessary for many types of preclinical translational research.  IPIM is involved intimately in the development and use of the recently completed Center for Surgical  Innovation (CSI), a unique novel intraoperative clinical and preclinical surgery-imaging facility that includes  state-of-the-art MRI and CT scanners that enable scanning a patient during surgical procedures. Finally the  IPIM (Strawbridge, Hoopes) oversees and facilitates several alternating magnetic field (AMF) generators  and coils currently used to activate magnetic nanoparticles in the ongoing NCCC nanotechnology cancer  research program. IPIM activities are overseen by P. Jack Hoopes (DVM, PhD) and a senior internal  advisory board with very significant knowledge and experience in all scientific aspects of these services.  Activities are scheduled and managed by a centralized staff of seven highly experienced and trained  scientists and resource managers. Each service receives oversight from the director as well as a co-  director highly trained in that specific area. David J. Gladstone (DSc, DABMP), chief of radiation physics,  Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center, directs the irradiation service. A research veterinarian, Dr. Karen  Moodie (DVM, MS), directs the preclinical and animal imaging resource. Radu Stan (MD, PhD) directs the  optical cellular (including confocal) services. The Electron Microscopy facility and program is directed by Dr.  Charles Daghlian (PhD). Due to the need for daily expertise and support, the irradiation resource and  optical cellular (confocal) and electron microscopy resources each have operational support from  managers Rendall Strawbridge, Christopher Ogomo, and Kenneth Orndorff, along with image processing  consultant Alex Hartov, all who are on site to assist and access information."

"9598228","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Astrocytes interact with all types of neural cells by establishing direct cell-cell contacts through gap junctions and/or by releasing gliotransmitters which modulate synaptic activity, brain microcirculation, as well as neuroinflammatory and metabolic responses. Among the various types of paracrine signals, purinergic ATP-mediated signaling is emerging as the most prominent mechanism by which astrocytes interact among themselves and with neurons. This is because neural cells release and respond to ATP. ATP release from cells occurs through distinct mechanisms including ion channels. Recently, Pannexin1 (Panx1), a vertebrate ortholog of invertebrate gap junction protein, was found to form channels that we and others have proposed to be the site for ATP release. Pannexins are abundantly expressed in the CNS, both in glia and neurons, where they have been implicated in ischemic neuronal death and epileptiform activity. In concordance with the proposed role of Panx1 channels in hyperactivity, we recently found, using two different mouse lines with global Panx1 deletion that ATP release through these channels contributes to prolong the clinical manifestations of status epilepticus. A main question that remains to be answered, however, regards the cell type (astrocyte or neuron) that contributes to Panx1-mediated seizures. Thus, the overall aim of this grant application is to determine key missing information regarding cell-cell communication via Pannexin1 channels in the CNS, including the biophysical properties of these channels and the signal transduction events both leading to and resulting from Panx1 activation. For that we will use newly available conditional Panx1-null mice to directly evaluate the extent to which astrocyte or neuronal Panx1 channels contribute to status epilepticus by releasing ATP and to provide new mechanistic understanding of gating and signal transduction events of this new type of channel."
"9446441","PROJECT SUMMARY Hijacking of normal developmental programs is a common mechanism of tumorigenesis and epigenetic deregulation of developmental transcription programs is central to the genesis of most, if not all, pediatric cancers. Ewing sarcomas, aggressive bone and soft tissue tumors that predominately arise in adolescence, continue to be associated with high rates of mortality and novel approaches to therapy are needed. Ewing sarcomas are characterized by the presence of pathognomonic driver fusion oncogenes, most commonly EWS/FLI1, and their likely cellular origin is mesenchymal stem/progenitor cells (MSC). EWS/FLI1 initiates tumorigenesis by inducing widespread disruption of transcriptional regulation as a consequence of altered recruitment of chromatin remodelers to target gene enhancers and promoters. We have reported that posterior HOXD genes, in particular HOXD13, are aberrantly over-expressed by Ewing sarcoma and that posterior HOXD genes contribute to maintenance of the tumorigenic phenotype. Our preliminary studies suggest that EWS/FLI1 can induce expression of HOXD13, in a cell context dependent fashion, and that this activation is mediated by aberrant activation of developmental enhancers that are otherwise active in only very discrete spatiotemporal developmental windows. In addition, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) studies have demonstrated that in EWS/FLI1+ cells the HOXD13 promoter is preferentially enriched with the MLL- dependent activating histone modification H3K4me3 and bound by both MLL and menin proteins. Significantly, exposure of Ewing sarcoma cells to novel small molecule inhibitors of MLL:menin interaction, that are currently in preclinical development for MLL-fusion positive leukemias, leads to a dramatic loss tumorigenicity and concomitant loss posterior HOXD gene expression. Thus, these studies demonstrate that that, like MLL-fusion positive leukemias, maintenance of the oncogenic phenotype of Ewing sarcoma is critically dependent on MLL:menin-dependent activation of developmental HOX genes. In this proposal, we will test the hypothesis that HOXD13 functions an obligate cooperative oncogene in Ewing sarcoma and that dependency on its continued expression presents a previously unrecognized tumor-specific vulnerability that can be therapeutically exploited. In Aim 1 will use innovative Bru-seq technologies and functional validation studies to define the downstream transcriptional targets of HOXD13 that promote tumorigenicity. In Aim 2 we will use targeted ChIP assays and chromatin conformation studies to determine how EWS/FLI1 leads to epigenetic activation of HOXD13. In Aim 3 we will test the therapeutic potential of MI-503, a small molecule inhibitor of MLL:menin protein:protein interaction, in in vivo tumor models. These studies will together elucidate the contribution of HOXD13 to Ewing sarcoma pathogenesis and test the potential of a new class of epigenetic modifying agents for Ewing sarcoma-targeted therapies."
"9404375","Project Summary/Abstract: Immunology and Cancer Immunotherapy (ICI)  The overall goal of the Immunology and Cancer Immunotherapy (ICI) Program is to unite the efforts of basic  and clinical immunologists to explore the immune system's impact on cancer development and progression, to  develop novel strategies that use immunity to treat cancer, and to conduct clinical trials to test novel  therapeutics and approaches to improve patient outcomes and increase overall survival. There are twenty-one  members from six different academic departments and two professional schools. The current focus and  initiatives of the ICI scientists are centered on three themes: Immune regulation, Immune effector  mechanisms, and Translational immunotherapy. The immunotherapy approaches are focused on adoptive  T cell therapy, vaccination, and immune regulation blockade. While basic research is a key focus, many faculty  members actively are involved in translational bench-to-bedside research. Other members are clinicians  (hematologists, oncologists or oncologic surgeons) who actively are involved in clinical research and clinical  trials. This program joins established and experienced clinical trialists with NCI-funded cancer immunologists to  design, execute, and complete Dartmouth-initiated immunotherapy trials in renal cell carcinoma, melanoma,  glioblastoma, colorectal carcinoma, multiple myeloma and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. There are  extensive collaborations between ICI members around common areas of interest in immunobiology and  immunotherapy, as evidenced by joint publications and funded grants. Major contributions of the program to  the mission of the NCCC have been the facilitation of new insights into the tumor microenvironment and how  this is affected by leukocytes, the development of novel protein and cell therapies, the translation of Dartmouth  investigator ideas into clinical trials, and the accrual of patients to these trials. NCCC has made substantial  commitment to improving the depth and breadth of research and clinical translation of the ICI program through  support of shared resources, financial awards for new pilot grants, and strategic recruitment of new  investigators. More than 280 cancer-related articles have been published over the reporting period, with 46  (16%) appearing in high impact journals. Intra-programmatic publications (43=15%) involved 19 of our 22  members, and inter-programmatic publications (66=24%) involved 15 members. Total grant funding for the  program currently is $6.4M, of which $5.5M is peer-reviewed and $2.2M is from NCI."
"9404356","Project Summary/Abstract (Description): Developmental Funds  NCCC uses discretionary funds in general, and CCSG Developmental Funds in particular, to pursue new  opportunities, promote novel transdisciplinary collaborations, and advance meritorious cancer research. In  response to the 2008 review, we have retained a priority for investment in new faculty recruitment, where  return on investment historically has been highest. Refinement in use of Developmental Funds has been  linked to insights arising from planning and evaluation activities. In response to External Advisor  recommendations, we have emphasized collaborative initiatives, and Members subsequently have secured an  NCI U54 award in Cancer Nanotechnology and NIGMS P20 IDeA multi-project awards in quantitative  biomedical sciences and in molecular epidemiology. NCCC utilizes its five-year Strategic Plan to prioritize  announcements and financing of projects requesting use of developmental funds. The full portfolio of NCCC  developmental approaches includes pilot projects, new faculty funding, interim support, and investment in  advanced technology and new Shared Resource services. Recipients of pilot awards totaling $687,853 in  CCSG funds secured $16.3M in subsequent funding (see Table 2). We have directed pilot project awards to  strategic areas, such as multi-investigator proposals, translational studies, and early phase clinical trials. We  have examples of faculty refocusing on cancer-relevant questions (e.g., Stan [CM]), teams subsequently  securing multi-investigator awards (e.g., Roberts, Paulsen, and Pogue [CIR]), and junior faculty securing peer-  reviewed support (e.g., Danilov [MT]). During the current award period, we received renewal with a 25%  increase in the ACS-IRG pilot award program NCCC conducts. Our most recent call for pilot projects secured  proposals from over 25% of our Members, indicating the value perceived in this opportunity, and we selected 8  of 24 proposals, including at least one from each Program. We have invested $315,000 in CCSG funds in new  faculty recruitments who have secured $10.8M in subsequent peer-reviewed funding (see Table 3). NCCC  has in place policies addressing bridging (resubmission of approved but unfunded proposals) and retention  (preparation of new proposals) support, both of which rely on NCCC discretionary funds rather than CCSG  support. We have utilized NCCC developmental funds to promote Member utilization of new technologies,  including deep-sequencing and preclinical imaging. We have augmented services available to Members  through existing NCCC Shared Resources by developing new capabilities, such as geospatial mapping and  speed congenics. Renewal of CCSG Developmental Funds will support pilot project awards in priority areas  such as translational research, new faculty recruitment in strategic initiatives in early phase clinical  development and cancer immunotherapy, the 2015 opening of the NCCC-directed floor in the adjacent  Williamson Translational Research Building, and collaborative groups around emerging themes such as  precision medicine, surgical innovation, and behavioral interventions aimed at cancer risk reduction."
"9549520","The pathology of traumatic brain injury in experimental models includes acute inflammatory reaction, blood brain barrier disruption, hemorrhage, demyelination, axonal transection and chronically with axonal neuronal loss and gliosis. Stem cell (SC) therapy is a potential treatment either as replacement therapy or via paracrine effect with release of growth factors and anti-inflammatory cytokines for TBI injury. We reported on a longitudinal study in a mild TBI rat model based on MRI and correlated to histology over 2 months. We reported that diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) axial diffusivity and fractional anisotropy (FA) were sensitive to axonal integrity, whereas radial diffusivity showed significant correlation to the myelin compactness. We also observed that FA was correlated with astrogliosis in the gray matter, whereas mean diffusivity was correlated with increased cellularity and magnetization transfer ratio (MTR) demonstrated a strong correlation with both axon and myelin integrity. We also were able to demonstrate that in rats with mild ventriculomegaly (MVM) demonstrated insignificant changes in FA, suggesting less axonal injury compared to normal rats following mild TBI.  The MVM animals had significant increase in MTR compared to normal rats following mild TBI. On histological examination, limited axonal injury with significant increase of microgliosis and astrogliosis in MVM brains compared with normal animals. MVM rats exhibited greater inflammation following TBI compared to normal rat brains.  These results indicated the importance of using MRI to screen for brain abnormalities in experimental animals used in TBI studies and that the variation observed in TBI studies may be due to the variability in response to induced trauma as a result of structural morphology The relationship between changes in diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and magnetization transfer imaging (MTI) and the underlying pathologies is still relatively unknown.We investigated the radiological-pathological correlation between these imaging techniques and immunohistochemistry using a closed head rat model of TBI. TBI was performed on female rats followed longitudinally by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) out to 30 days postinjury, with a subset of animals selected for histopathological analyses. A MRI-based finite element analysis was generated to characterize the pattern of the mechanical insult and estimate the extent of brain injury to direct the pathological correlation with imaging findings. We observed that DTI axial diffusivity and fractional anisotropy (FA) were sensitive to axonal integrity, whereas radial diffusivity showed significant correlation to the myelin compactness. FA was correlated with astrogliosis in the gray matter, whereas mean diffusivity was correlated with increased cellularity. Secondary inflammatory responses also partly affected the changes of these DTI metrics. The magnetization transfer ratio (MTR) at 3.5ppm demonstrated a strong correlation with both axon and myelin integrity. Decrease in MTR at 20ppm correlated with the extent of astrogliosis in both gray and white matter. Conventional T2-weighted MRI did not detect abnormalities following TBI, DTI and MTI afforded complementary insight into the underlying pathologies reflecting varying injury states over time, and thus may substitute for histology to reveal diffusive axonal injury pathologies in vivo."
"9435727","Project Summary  Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) has adapted to survive a wide range of assaults?from our immune response to antimicrobial therapeutics?intended to eradicate the organism. However, the molecular switches that enable Mtb to endure these stresses, to slow replication or to become dormant as a latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) are not known. Emerging studies on the molecular underpinnings of stress survival in Escherichia coli generally point to a major role for toxin-antitoxin (TA) systems, which are operons comprising adjacent genes encoding two small proteins, a toxin and its cognate antitoxin that inhibits toxin activity in the TA protein-protein complex. Their expression has been implicated in Mtb stress survival and/or the switch to the non-replicating persistent state characteristic of LTBI. However, several bottlenecks have impeded progress toward rigorous testing of this provocative association. This proposal enlists a proven collaborative team with combined expertise in four core components of the proposed work--toxin-antitoxin systems, M. tuberculosis biology and physiology, bioinformatics/computational biology and RNA-seq. The goal of this R21 proposal is to enlist our 5? RNA-seq technology to identify the RNA targets among the uncharacterized Mtb VapC toxin family members. This approach directly tests our hypothesis that tRNA-cleaving VapC toxins collude to downregulate Mtb growth by surgically inactivating a single tRNA, followed by translation inhibition of key proteins that contribute to growth regulation that require this depleted tRNA. In addition to illuminating the mechanism of action of the VapC family of toxins, these studies should uncover new insights into the full spectrum of molecular events that underlie the growth regulating properties of these toxins. A better understanding of these processes is essential for the development of more effective treatments for LTBI. !"

"9428315","Perinatal arterial ischemic stroke is estimated to occur in 1/2300?1/5000 live births and can result in long-term deficits in motor, cognitive, attention, and executive functions and persistent seizures. Rapid diagnosis of focal ischemic stroke in newborns, the timing of the stroke, and differentiation of perinatal stroke from global hypoxia-ischemia allow more efficient and directed interventions/prognosticacions. In the proposed work, we will develop miniaturized noninvasive photoacoustic imaging for use on the scalp of human fetuses and newborns to dynamically track changes in oxygenation in sagittal sinus venous blood and regional cortical tissue both during and after labor. Using a newborn animal with a large gyrencephalic brain, we will validate the oxygenation measurements against directly measured sagittal sinus O2 saturation during hypoxia-ischemia and against pimonidazole-based measurements of regional tissue hypoxia during focal stroke. Based on these data, we will then develop algorithms for detecting graded progressive ischemia based on tissue hemoglobin content and O2 saturation. We will test the sensitivity and specificity of these algorithms with different size and locations of photothrombotic-induced stroke. Furthermore, secondary injury cascades that transpire in the immature brain after arterial thrombotic stroke may differ from those that transpire in mature brain and likely depend on maturation of connectivity and energy metabolism in specific brain regions. After photothrombosis of the middle cerebral artery, we will contrast dynamic changes in tissue hemoglobin content and O2 saturation in 1) the metabolically active primary sensorimotor cortex, known to be selectively vulnerable to hypoxia- ischemia, 2) the metabolically quiescent secondary sensorimotor cortex known to be resistant to hypoxia- ischemia, and 3) the watershed penumbra. In addition, we will use noninvasive imaging to track tissue uptake of photoacoustically sensitive dyes conjugated to different size molecules and relate regional differences in size-dependent blood brain-barrier permeability to markers of energy metabolism. Finally, we will investigate whether stabilizing anti-inflammatory, anti-epileptic, anti-platelet, pro-vasodilatory, and pro-angiogenic epoxyeicosatrienoic acids with an inhibitor of soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) is protective. Though pretreatment with such inhibitors is protective in adult rodent models of transient cerebral ischemia, post- treatment efficacy has not been determined with prolonged ischemia or in immature brain. We will test the concept that a multi-potent sEH inhibitor will attenuate neuroinflammation, blood-brain barrier permeability, perivascular loss of aquaporin-4 channels, ischemia-induced increase in Sur1-TrpM4 channels known to contribute to malignant edema, and the loss of peri-ischemic neurons, while promoting VEGF expression; we will also determine whether an inhibitor of EET synthesis will exert the opposite effects. Therefore, this application will reveal new insights into the mechanisms of injury from perinatal thrombotic ischemia, provide a potential therapeutic target, and enable an innovative technological advance for screening newborns for stroke."

"9393987","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The Tissue Engineering and Cell Models Core (TECM) enables DDRCC investigators to address key questions relating to causality and mechanisms by providing novel and vetted experimental models that can be customized to their needs. It was established 21 months ago, replacing the Genomics and Molecular Engineering (GME) Core of the DDRCC. The reorganization of the Core was a direct result of two sequential annual needs assessments indicating strong interest by the membership for more physiologically-relevant experimental models to study digestive health and diseases. The TECM has three major components: (1) A centralized repository and facility for established and primary gut-relevant cell lines, which was originally part of the host-microbe core, but moved to the TECM to centralize all cell and tissue experimental systems, (2) A tissue engineering component that includes customizing and developing intestinal organoid technologies for specific applications needed by DDRCC users, and (3) an experimental systems component that includes in vivo models (rodent microsurgery and C. elegans), ex vivo models, and live functional assays. Inherent to these services, the TECM provides training and education, opportunities for cost-savings through bulk purchases (serum, disposables, etc), and technical expertise that saves investigators time and insure high quality of services. The TECM is inextricably tied to the other DDRCC cores. The integrated Translational Research (ITR) and the Host-Microbe (HM) cores are essential for providing cells, tissues, and patient samples for establishing the experimental models. The Tissue and Cell Analysis (TCA) core provides investigators with the means to analyze data derived from the model systems. Thus, the TECM Core has had great impact in enabling DDRCC members to advance knowledge in the thematic areas fostered by the DDRCC which focus on the study of IBD, host-microbe interactions, mucosal immunology and inflammation. In the past year, it was used by 86% of the DDRCC membership and was used in 195 peer-reviewed publications or 65% of the total (306) DDRCC-acknowledged publications during this period. The TECM has promoted interaction, collaboration, cost-sharing, and efficient resources utilization, and, at the same time, has enhanced the capabilities of our investigators."

"9588477","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Real-Time Unbiased Pathogen Detection in Febrile Illnesses by Nanopore Sequencing Acute febrile illness is one of the most common presenting symptoms in clinical medicine, with a broad differential that includes a variety of infectious etiologies. Conventional laboratory testing can take days to a result, and most rapid detection technologies such as PCR are limited to the detection of a single or narrow range of targets. Unbiased diagnosis of all pathogens in a single test by metagenomic next-generation sequencing has proven feasible, although still requires >24 hours due to long sequencing times, lack of portable instrumentation, and/or the complexity of bioinformatics analysis. Here we propose to use the Oxford Nanopore, a USB-sized, portable sequencing instrument with current read capacity of 500 Gb data and >100,000 reads, to develop a diagnostic assay to rapidly diagnose patients with acute febrile illness by screening for all potential pathogens in under 2 hours. We have already demonstrated in preliminary data that metagenomic detection of Chikungunya and Ebola virus performed by real-time nanopore sequencing and analysis is possible with a 6-hour sample-to-answer timeframe. In years 1-2 (R21 phase), we will optimize the assay, validate it in a CLIA-certified laboratory by developing standard operating procedures, establish its performance characteristics including sensitive, specificity, and limits f detection, and develop standalone and cloud-based software pipelines for real-time sequencing analysis. In years 3-5 (R33 phase), we use it to test positive and negative control clinical samples from patients with acute febrile illness. We will also use it to investigate clinical samples from patients with febrile respiratory and systemic illnesses and infected by a variety of pathogens, including influenza virus, Ebola virus, Lassa virus, Chikungunya virus, enterovirus D68, and Plasmodium falciparum (malaria). We will also test the platform at point-of-care field sites in California (California Department of Public Health), Central America (American Red Cross) and Democratic Republic of the Congo, Africa (Institut National de Recherches Medicales). Ultimately, the goal of this 5-year project is implementation of a field-ready, real-time sequencing assay for unbiased pathogen diagnosis of acute febrile illness by metagenomic nanopore sequencing."
"9420794","DNA polymerase (Pol) ?, a B-family Pol, plays an important role in replication of damaged DNA. Extensive biochemical studies with Pol? have shown that it is very inefficient at inserting nucleotides (nts) opposite DNA lesions but is highly efficient at extending synthesis from the correct or incorrect nt opposite DNA lesions. Since translesion DNA synthesis (TLS) through a large variety of DNA lesions requires the sequential action of an inserter and an extender Pol, by extending synthesis opposite from diverse DNA lesions, Pol? performs a critical task in the replication of damaged DNA. In yeast, Rev1 performs an indispensable but non-catalytic role as a component of Pol??? and it increases Pol??s efficiency for extension from incorrect nts opposite DNA lesions. Consequently, the Rev1/Pol? complex promotes highly error-prone TLS and thereby accounts for damage induced mutagenesis in yeast. In striking contrast to the requirement of Rev1 for yeast Pol? function, Rev1 is not required for Pol? function in TLS in normal human cells. Instead, we provide evidence here that Pol? acts as an indispensable component of human (h) Pol?? and in concert with Pol?, hPol? promotes a predominantly error-free mode of TLS opposite various DNA lesions. In the proposed studies, we will utilize a combination of genetic, cellular, biochemical, and structural studies to: elucidate the role of Pol? in Pol? dependent TLS in human cells, determine the fidelity and action mechanism of Pol? in TLS opposite DNA lesions which impair Watson-Crick (W-C) base pairing, and define the molecular mechanisms that allow Pol??s active site to handle such DNA lesions. In Aim 1, we will: (a) analyze the requirement of Pol? and its domains for Pol?-dependent TLS and mutagenesis opposite a variety of DNA lesions in human cells; (b) examine the role of Pol? in UV induced mutagenesis in the cII gene carried in the mouse genome; (c) determine the requirement of Pol? domains for localization of Pol??into replication foci in UV damaged human cells; (d) examine whether Pol? associates with hPol? in a physical complex in UV damaged human cells; and (e) determine the effects of Pol? on fork progression in UV irradiated human cells. In Aim 2, we will (a) use steady-state kinetic analyses to determine the catalytic efficiency and fidelity of Pol? in inserting nucleotides opposite N1-methyladenine (N1-MeA) and the 3?T and 5?T of a (6-4) TT photoproduct, and (b) carry out pre- steady-state kinetic studies to determine the action mechanism of Pol? for inserting the correct nt opposite these DNA lesions which impair W-C base pairing. In Aim 3, we will (a) determine the structures of binary and ternary complexes of Pol? bound to N1-MeA template in the absence or presence of an incoming dTTP, respectively, (b) determine the structures of binary and ternary complexes of Pol? bound to the (6-4) TT photoproduct-containing templates in the absence or presence of an incoming dATP, respectively, and (c) carry out mutational analyses of residues deemed from the structures as important for stabilizing the damaged template.?"
"9455843","While advances in antiviral small-molecule therapeutics have been made, the inherently high-rate of viral mutation can rapidly give rise to drug resistance and significantly complicate the treatment and eradication of viral infections. The development of fundamentally new approaches toward therapeutics targeting highly conserved proteins among phylogenetically distant viral strains provides an enhanced genetic barrier to resistance and may constitute a general mechanism for the development of antiviral agents. Viral capsid proteins have highly conserved and critical roles in the viral life cycle of many viruses; however, they represent challenging pharmacological targets and therapeutic approaches, typically involving small-molecule inhibitors, have failed to provide sufficient efficacy. This proposal introduces a fundamentally novel oligonucleotide-based protein inhibition approach that enables the targeted degradation of viral capsid proteins through a highly specific oligonucleotide-protein interaction. In Aim 1 a panel of oligonucleotide aptamers for the targeted degradation of HIV-1 nucleocapsid protein and HBV core protein will be constructed. Using these sets of agents, structure-activity relationship studies will be completed through target protein quantification in order to confirm the ability to degrade capsid proteins, as well as to identify optimized degradation-inducing aptamers. Applying the optimized aptamers, Aim 2 will encompass a therapeutic evaluation of the effect of capsid protein degradation on capsid export and viral gene replication in cellular models of HIV and HBV. Tests that the antiviral efficacy is associated with capsid degradation and not off-target toxicity or an innate immune response will be conducted. In addition, proteomics experiments will confirm the specificity of the protein degrading agents. The degradation-inducing oligonucleotides will be utilized in new cellular delivery methods in order to obviate the need for transfection agents and to set the stage for animal experiments. The expected outcomes of these aims are the development and evaluation of a new technology for the inhibition of viral capsid function through targeted protein degradation. The proposed aims are based on our strong preliminary results in the development of oligonucleotides for the targeting and degrading of proteins, providing an early validation of this novel approach. The proposed research is significant because it provides a highly efficacious approach for complete inhibition of viral capsid functions via programmed protein degradation, thereby overcoming many of the current limitations of nucleic acid-based protein binders. Due to the expected general applicability, this approach will have long-term implications beyond the scope of this proposal."
"9448646","PROJECT SUMMARY The implications of microRNAs (miRNAs) in cardiovascular disease have recently been recognized, representing the most rapidly evolving research field. Atherosclerosis, major cause of CVD, is a chronic disease characterized by lipid retention and vascular inflammation. Macrophages are recognized to have a unique impact on the disease progression. Within the atherosclerotic plaque macrophages respond to a large number of signals, which promote complex changes in gene transcription as well as post-transcriptional regulatory mechanisms of control of gene expression. Important players of the post-transcriptional regulatory network are the small non- coding RNAs, microRNAs, which have a demonstrated role in the control of transcriptional networks in macrophages. miR-21 is the most abundant miRNA in macrophages accounting for 42% of total miRNA content. However its role in regulating macrophage functions during atherogenesis remains unexplored. Intriguingly, miRNAs can be transferred from cell to cell by exosomes, thus facilitating the exchange of information among cells. In the context of atherosclerosis the effect of miR-21 has not been explored in light of their possible delivery, via exosomes to vascular cells such as endothelial cells (ECs) or vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). Collectively, this work will define the mechanisms by which miR-21 regulates atherogenesis, will determine the paracellular actions of macrophage miR-21 in vivo on ECs or VSMCs within atherosclerotic plaques and shed insights into miR-21 role as potential therapeutic target for atherosclerosis."
"9397574","The purpose of this grant is to define the role of endogenous stem cells in coronary collateral growth. This problem is significant because patients with ischemic heart disease, who have well developed collaterals show a lower incidence of sudden death, have smaller infarcts in the event of an occlusion, and demonstrate a better prognosis than patients with poorly developed collaterals. Currently, there is no evidence (pro or con) that endogenous stem cells are even involved in coronary collateral growth. One goal of the present application is to rectify this deficiency by establishing if stem cells participate in coronary collateral growth and then the mechanisms underlying this effect. Within this context we propose three aims. In the first aim, we will determine the factors produced by the myocardium and coronary vasculature that induce homing and reprogramming of bone marrow stem cells. In this aim, we will define which factors that are produced by the heart and/or growing vasculature activate stem cell homing to the heart and coronary collateral vasculature. Studies will be performed to examine gain and loss of function of 4 key factors to establish their roles in this adaptive, important process. We also will determine if these factors also induce reprogramming of bone marrow in addition to their effects of homing. Reprogramming is used in this context to suggest that these factors will increase the population of sub-classes of bone marrow cells that are committed to a vascular differentiation program. In the second aim, we will determine if stem cells that are recruited to the heart or to the growing vasculature are essential for the process of collateral growth. We will first establish the sub-types of stem cells that home to the heart and coronary vasculature. Then will we study if depletion or enrichment of these cells (during the creation of the chimeric model) will blunt or magnify, respectively, coronary collateral growth. After we have established the type of stem cells that are critical for coronary collateral growth, our studies will focus on the third aim to delineate the fate of the stem cells in the heart by addressing the question: Do they engraft in collateral arteries and differentiate into smooth muscle or endothelium? The overarching goal of these studies is to fill the current void in our understanding about the role of endogenous stem cells in the growth of coronary collaterals. If coronary collateral growth could be stimulated it would theoretically obviate the need for a bypass as a collateral is ?nature?s bypass.? Our overall approach is to use the experience of diverse research team in many disciplines?physiology, vascular biology, in vivo imaging, biochemistry, molecular biology?to address this problem."
"9455850","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT: In genetically heterogeneous humans, differing combinatorial subsets drawn from a larger overall pool of potential disease susceptibility genes may contribute to type-1 diabetes (T1D) pathogenesis by eliciting perturbations at differing operational points within a common set of immunoregulatory pathways. This genetic complexity is illustrated by the previous observation that nominally resistant mouse strains can carry gene variants which when expressed in the proper combinatorial context contribute more strongly to T1D development than the corresponding allele from disease susceptible NOD mice. We propose that T1D developing in progeny from outcross/backcross between NOD and nondiabetic strains, wherein susceptibility genes come from both parental genomes, more accurately reflects the situation in humans. This proposal focuses on a potent likely single recessively-acting diabetogenic gene discovered in the distal region of Chromosome (Chr.) 11 of a disease resistant C57BL/6J (B6) stock congenic for the NOD derived H2g7 MHC haplotype (B6.H2g7). This B6.H2g7 origin gene in tight linkage with the marker D11Mit48 acts through CD4 T cells to more strongly promote pathogenic activation of diabetogenic CD8 T cells than the NOD allelic variant. The discovery of a single gene exerting strikingly divergent effects on how CD4 T cells support pathogenic CD8 T cells presents a unique opportunity to better understand and design treatments for immunological tolerance induction defects underlying T1D susceptibility. The current proposal seeks to (1) identify the Chr.11 gene that supports or suppresses pathogenic CD8 T-cell activation to determine whether it may be targeted for disease prevention and (2) define which CD4 T cell population is directly controlled by the D11Mit48-linked locus to regulate diabetogenic CD8 T cells."

"9555576","Historically, the detection and identification of bacteria, mycobacteria, yeasts, and molds have relied primarily on their morphologic and phenotypic properties. This approach is imprecise and slow for many clinically significant microbes. We have explored alternative methods, such as targeted sequencing and mass spectrometry, for the detection and identification of selected organisms. Studies in the current fiscal year have focused on alternative identification methods, specifically MALDI-TOF (matrix-assisted laser desorption-ionization time of flight mass spectrometry) for the identification of Nocardia, mycobacteria, and molds and rapid genomic assays for identification, typing and detection of antibiotic resistance in M. abscessus group. MALDI-TOF MS provides a reproducible spectral pattern based on the mass/charge (m/z) ratio of ionized proteins. Preparation of samples is rapid and inexpensive. Well-characterized reference strains of mycobacteria, Nocardia and molds allowed us to build a NIH database that was then challenged with clinical isolates. Following a demonstration of excellent performance, MALDI-TOF MS has become the method of choice of the NIH Microbiology Service for identification of both rapid and slowly growing mycobacteria as well as filamentous molds. This approach has been recently validated for the identification of Nocardia at the NIH and more recently also at two other academic centers. A multi center evaluations of the performance of the NIH mold database is ongoing. Finally, we are exploring the use of proteomics and in particular Maldi-Tof MS for direct detection of microbial antigens in clinical samples and our project was granted a Bench to Bedside (BtB) award. Our findings support the validity of this approach for detection of circulating antigens of Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Mycobacterium avium complex and is being currently evaluated for other species of mycobacteria."

"9549559","The initial goal of the study is to determine if we can collect our goal of 5 x 1010 granulocytes. Several aspects of the protocol need to be optimized to maximize our efficiency and our resulting yield. G-CSF is used to stimulate granulocyte production. Dexamethasone and Hespan is used to sediment the cells being apheresed. Our initial 3 apheresis procedures confirmed significant increases in granulocyte production and efficiency of collection. Operational adjustments such as increasing flow rates negatively effect intravascular calcium potentially significant morbidity, continue to be worked out. We have been able to collect 3.2 x 1010 cells and are confident with additional adjustments we can reach our target which would then allow us to proceed with determining the efficacy of the therapy in improving survival during severe sepsis."

"9464494","Project Summary The goal of this SBIR Fast-Track project is to further the commercialization of PathoVax?s bi-valent RGVaxTM as a broad spectrum Human Papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine that targets all clinically relevant HPVs. Current HPV vaccines provide type-restricted protection that focuses only on sexually transmitted HPVs resulting in an unexpected STD stigma that directly affects uptake rates. By targeting additional HPVs especially non-sexual types that causes diseases such as recalcitrant anogenital, cutaneous warts, and life-threatening laryngeal papilloma?s, RGVax? offers the potential to be marketed as a general public health vaccine. This provides the opportunity to sidestep current social stigma and potentially increase market uptake. This unique advantage will attract strategic partners that PathoVax will work with to bring RGVax? into the clinic. PathoVax has licensed the underlying prototype technology based on a HPV virus-like particle (VLP) platform that displays 360 copies of the highly conserved, stable HPV epitope (RG1). Animal vaccination studies utilizing this prototype have confirmed broad-spectrum protection against 27 HPVs, a dramatic improvement over current HPV vaccine that only protects 9 types at best. Given the broad protection, this prototype was awarded an NCI PREVENT grant that supports manufacturing and IND enabling studies. To enhance the odds of market success for this innovation, PathoVax has developed an improved bi-valent RGVaxTM formulation as the final commercial product to satisfy FDA-mandated antibody titer standards and provide comprehensive HPV- disease protection. In this SBIR-Fast Track, Phase 1 specific aims focuses on benchmarking our finalized formulation to obtain competitive profiling data against Gardasil-9®, the current standard of care for HPV prevention. This will be done in the same animal models used to validate the current Gardasil vaccine franchise owned by Merck (Aim 1). Once we have demonstrated RGVax?s superiority, we will transition into phase 2 specifics aims whereby PathoVax will demonstrate RGVax?s efficacy data in animal models that simulates immune-suppression, so as to develop pivotal preclinical data to support PathoVax?s clinical strategy by demonstrating RGVaxTM?s ability to prevent skin HPV disease in organ transplant recipients (OTRs) as a first indication for marketing approval (Aim 2). Additionally, PathoVax will provide the FDA with a GMP manufacturing strategy to produce the bi-valent RGVaxTM formulation by working with a vaccine contract manufacturer (CMO) to develop a production and purification process (Aim 3A), and also demonstrate this process produces RGVax vaccine particles that are superior or equivalent to current laboratory produced particles (3B). The timely development of this data package is critical for both our upcoming pre-IND FDA discussion, fund raising to investor groups and initiating our IND-enabling program for a bi-valent phase 1b/2a clinical trial."
"9549472","Early studies focused on septic shock pathophysiology (Am J Physiol 1988; Chest 1990), the role of endotoxemia (J Clin Invest 1989; J Exp Med 1989; Chest 1991; N Engl J Med 1993; Infect Immun 1996), and the efficacy of various anti-endotoxin therapies (Antimicrob Agents Chemother 1989) including lipid A analogs (J Clin Invest 1987; Pharm Res 1990) and antibodies (JAMA 1993; J Infect Dis 1994).  Nitric oxide (NO) was examined as an important mediator of septic shock (Crit Care Med 1993; JAMA 1996). Non-selective NO synthase inhibitors were found to be sometimes toxic and never beneficial (J Exp Med 1992; Crit Care Med 1998; Am J Respir Crit Care Med 1998).  Increased NO production in normal volunteers challenged with endotoxin was blocked by ibuprofen, but blood pressure was unaffected, suggesting that other mechanisms compensated to maintain vasodilation (J Pharmacol Exp Ther 1999).  Severity of illness (risk of death) influenced the therapeutic efficacy of anti-inflammatory agents in septic shock (Am J Respir Crit Care Med 2002).  L-arginine without or with N-acetylcysteine in a canine model of septic shock was found to be harmful (Crit Care Med 2006). L-arginine had been a component of immunonutrition formulas marketed for use in critically ill patients.  A canine septic shock model was redeveloped to balance animal welfare and scientific relevance. Both specific and supportive titrated therapies routinely used in patients were fully integrated into the model (Am J Physiol Heart Circ Physiol 2007).  Whether risk of death altered the effects of hydrocortisone was investigated in a mouse model of E. coli pneumonia (Intensive Care Med 2008).  Intra-aortic balloon counterpulsation was found to prolong survival in a hypodynamic canine model of Staphylococcal pneumonia-induced septic shock (Crit Care Med 2009). Low cardiac output is seen in 10 to 20 percent of adults and up to 50 percent of children with septic shock.  The U.S. Critical Illness and Injury Trials Group (USCIITG; http://www.usciitg.org/) was founded to create a clinical research framework that can reduce the barriers to investigation (Crit Care Med 2009).  A meta-analysis of bundled care for septic shock demonstrated consistent and significant improvements in survival that were only strongly associated with early and appropriate antibiotics and not other bundle components (Crit Care Med 2010).  SB203580, a p38 inhibitor, improved cardiac function but worsened lung injury and survival during E. coli pneumonia in mice (J Trauma 2010).  Fluids and vasopressors, standard approaches to septic shock were harmful in a rat model of anthrax lethal toxin (LeTx)-induced shock (Crit Care Med 2009). In sedated canines receiving mechanical ventilation, edema toxin increased mortality when added to equimolar lethal toxin challenges (J Infect Dis 2010).  Heparin in a mouse model of E. coli pneumonia failed to improve lung injury or survival (Crit Care Med 2011).   Corticosteroids that activate both mineralocorticoid (MR) and glucocorticoid receptors (GR) consistently reverse vasopressor-dependent hypotension in septic shock, but have variable effects on survival. In a canine model of S. aureus pneumonia-induced septic shock, MR and GR selective agonists were examined separately. Mineralocorticoid was only beneficial if given prophylactically, while glucocorticoid was most beneficial when given close to the onset of infection (Crit Care Med 2012). Stress dose corticosteroids were only beneficial in sepsis with a high risk for death (Intensive Care Med 2012).  Tigecycline was found to be associated with increased mortality and non-cure. Effects were not isolated to type of infection or comparator antibiotic regimen, and the impact on survival remained significant when limited to trials of approved indications (Clin Infect Dis 2012).  Staphylococcal enterotoxin including B (SEB) can trigger a lethal superantigen-mediated cytokine storm. These exotoxins contribute to the high mortality of S. aureus sepsis and are a potential bioweapon threat. Using an aerosolized-toxin mouse model, gene-expression changes across multiple organs implicated a host-wide IFN-response in SEB-induced death (PLoS One 2014).  Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) function was characterized serially over five days in 101 canines with severe Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia. HPA axis unresponsiveness and high aldosterone levels identified a septic shock subpopulation with poor outcomes that may have the greatest potential to benefit from new therapies (Am J Physiol Endocrinol Metab 2014).   Infections caused by multidrug-resistant and extensively drug-resistant gram-negative organisms are an important emerging threat to critically ill patients worldwide. Intravenous colistin administration identified a severely ill population with a high probability of having culture-confirmed extensively drug-resistant bacteria. Colistin-cases at 40 academic medical centers nearly trebled over 7 years (Clin Infect Dis 2015).  Meningoencephalitis was documented for the first time in a patient with Ebola virus disease at the NIH Clinical Center (Ann Intern Med 2016).  The Surfactant, Positive Pressure, and Pulse Oximetry Randomized Trial (SUPPORT) consent forms suggested that the low oxygen saturation arm was a widely practiced subset of usual care. An analysis of usual care practices demonstrated that oxygen targets and other interventions in the trial differed substantially from routine management outside of the trial (PLoS One 2016).  A survey of intensivists found that diagnosing sepsis is extremely subjective and variable, indicating the need for objective and standardized critieria (Critcal Care 2016).  Toxoplasmosis encephalitis was complicated by immune-reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS), in an allogeneic stem cell transplant patient (Bone Marrow Transplant 2016).  A clinical surveillance definition based on concurrent vasopressors, blood cultures, and antibiotics accurately identified septic shock hospitalizations and suggested that the incidence of septic shock has risen and mortality rates have fallen, but less dramatically than estimated using ICD-9 codes (Chest 2017).  In a propensity-score matched cohort of patients from 130 US hospitals, adjunctive intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) was administered infrequently for necrotizing fasciitis with vasopressor-dependent shock and had no apparent impact on mortality or hospital LOS beyond that achieved with debridement and antibiotics (Clin Infect Dis 2017).  Meta-analysis of available data in patients with cardiovascular disease demonstrated that a restrictive vs.liberal transfusion trigger was associated with an increased risk of death and acute coronary events (submitted).  Using electronic clinical data from over 400 hospitals, we estimated 1.7 million adults nationwide with serious infections and concurrent organ dysfunction in 2014.  Sepsis incidence was stable between 2009-2014; hospital mortality decreased but the combined outcome of death or discharge to hospice was stable (submitted).    Difficult to Treat Resistance (DTR) was defined as the treatment-limiting burden of resistance to all high-efficacy, low-toxicity antibiotics (penicillins, cephalosporins, carbapenems, and quinolones). A multicenter repository of hospitalized patients was examined to determine the prevalence of DTR gram-negative bloodstream infections and its impact on mortality (submitted).  Using inpatient encounters across 156 hospitals from 2000-2014 in the Cerner Healthfacts database prevalence of discordant antibiotic therapy displayed extensive taxon-level variability and was associated with patient and institutional factors. Discordance detrimentally impacted survival in gram negative and S. aureus bloodstream infections (in preparation)."
"9549518","We observed that dexamethasone, a glucocorticosteroid, leads to an unanticipated enhancement of endothelial inflammatory mediator production by extracellular ATP. These effects are mediated in part by a direct effect on the purinergic receptor (P2Y2R) promoter, enhancing transcription of P2Y2R mRNA and protein expression. Inflammation promoting effects include enhanced release of IL-8 and increased transcription of adhesion molecules (ICAM-1, VCAM-1 and SELE). This positive feedback loop of glucocorticoids and ATP-induced endothelial inflammation highlights the observation that glucocorticoids are not uniformly immunosuppressive and has implications for understanding the interactions that occur between the purinergic receptors and ATP in the pathogenesis of vascular inflammation in shock syndromes or atherosclerosis. (J Pharmacol Exp Ther 2010;335:693)  Dual specific phosphatases negatively regulate the effects of mitogen activated protein kinases. We show that dexamethasone, a glucocorticoid agonist and deoxycorticosterone, a mineralocorticoid agonist have novel effects on DUSP1 and DUSP5 expression and function. While qualitatively different, both dexamethasone and deoxycorticosterone induce DUSP1 and DUSP5 mRNA in endothelium.  The enhanced expression of both DUSP1 and DUSP5 by these corticosteroids suppressed the responses of endothelial cells to TNF alpha. Notably, the induction of DUSP1 mRNA by either dexamethasone or deoxycorticosterone was suppressed by TNFalpha stimulation whereas induction of DUSP5 mRNA by either corticosteroid was not. The suppression of glucocorticoid induction of DUSP1 may be a mechanism by which TNFa amplifies endothelial inflammatory responses.    COUP-TF-II is an orphan nuclear receptor that has essential roles in cardiovascular development and metabolic homeostasis. We investigated the effect of COUP-TF II on endothelial cell inflammatory responses. COUP-TFII mRNA expression is down-regulated by TNF alpha, while COUP-TFI is not affected. The down-regulation of COUP-TFII by TNF alpha is independent of MAPK pathways.  COUP-TFII silencing increases TNF alpha-induced IL-6 mRNA expression and decreases TNF alpha-induced E-selectin. COUP TF II may represent a novel therapeutic target in conditions characterized by endovascular injury and inflammation such as acute lung injury or septic shock.  This study is open for analysis only."
"9099311","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The dynein adaptor Lis1 plays a pivotal role in the oncogenesis of several cancers, including leukemia. In leukemia, Lis1 controls differential positioning of the mitotic spindle within the dividing cancer cell, resulting in the asymmetric cel divisions that allow these cells to divide away from their substratum and turn cancerous. Mutations in human Lis1 can also cause malformation of brain tissue, resulting in the devastating and fatal brain disease, Lissencephaly.  The long-term interest of the Miller lab is to  understand the microtubule-based mechanisms involved in orientation of the mitotic spindle, a process that requires the dynein motor protein.  The Miller lab has shown that SUMO is important for positioning the mitotic spindle. The Miller lab recently established that the dynein adaptor Pac1p, the yeast homologue of Lis1, is modified by both ubiquitin and SUMO. Preliminary data from the Miller lab shows that sumoylation regulates Lis1/Pac1p. However, the exact role that these modifications play in regulating Lis1/Pac1p and dynein is not known. The objective of this proposal is to identify the specific mechanisms by which sumoylation regulate Lis1/Pac1p and to determine the extent to which the SUMO modification of Lis1 is conserved in human cells. The rationale is that by achieving a fuller understanding of this key sumo regulation in yeast cells and establishing its translational impact in human cells, researchers can  advance similar investigations into many other tissue- specific disease models. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that sumoylation regulates Lis1 to control the dynein motor. This hypothesis will be tested by pursuing two specific aims using the yeast model organism. 1. Identify novel signal transduction mechanisms that regulate dynein. 2. Determine the role that SUMO targeted ubiquitin ligases (STUbLs) play in the activity of Lis1. A third Aim will characterize the SUMO modification in Lis1 in human cells. These Aims will be accomplished using a combination of biochemical, cell biological and genetic approaches. This work is significant because it will contribute to a new understanding of key mechanisms regulating microtubule-associated proteins and a major motor protein, aiding the development of improved cancer interventions. It will also provide insight into regulation of the sumoylated MAP tau, a MAP implicated in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's. This proposal is innovative because the approach is based on a new paradigm of sumoylation regulation of the microtubule dependent process of spindle-positioning, guided by preliminary data the Miller lab has generated. This work supports the NIH mission to pursue fundamental knowledge about the behavior of systems and the application of that knowledge to extend healthy life. This research project will allow students at all levels to learn research strategies and critical thinking skillsin hands-on research, inspiring them to pursue biomedical careers at the next level. This project strengthens the overall research environment at OSU by facilitating several intra- disciplinary collaborations."
"9449314","PROJECT SUMMARY Retinoid X receptor-? (RXR?), a unique member of the nuclear receptor superfamily, acts as a ligand- dependent transcription factor by recruiting coregulators to positively or negatively regulate target gene transcription. RXR? also acts nongenomically in the cytoplasm to crosstalk with different signaling pathways. However, the mechanisms by which RXR? exerts its nongenomic activities remain obscure. We propose that the nongenomic action of RXR? is regulated by a set of cytoplasmic coregulators that act as counterparts to nuclear coregulators, and that the effect of the nongenomic coregulators can be modulated by ligands via a unique binding mechanism. This innovative hypothesis is built upon our published and preliminary results. We previously reported that RXR? is proteolytically cleaved in cancer cells, resulting in an N-terminally-truncated RXR? (tRXR?) protein that resides in the cytoplasm, where it activates phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling by interacting with its p85? regulatory subunit. Recently, we discovered that an LxxLL motif utilized by genomic coactivators for binding to the coregulator-binding site (CoRBS) of nuclear receptors is present in p85? and required for binding. Our preliminary results also identified two tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR)-associated factors, TRAF2 and TRAF6, as potential nongenomic coregulators of tRXR? that regulate its activation of NF-?B. In our effort to identify and characterize small molecules for inhibiting tRXR? activities, we found via structural analysis that Sulindac-derived analogs bound to previously unrecognized sites on tRXR? to stabilize its tetrameric state, leading to dissociation of p85?. We also discovered a small molecule that binds to CoRBS of tRXR? and prevents its interaction with p85?. In this application, we propose a multidisciplinary approach to address our hypothesis, with 4 Aims: (1). Determine whether p85?, TRAF2 and TRAF6 serve as nongenomic coregulators of tRXR?. We will employ mutagenesis coupled with biological analysis to address the role of CoRBSs in tRXR? and cognate binding motifs in p85?, TRAF2, and TRAF6. (2). Define the structural and functional determinants of RXR?/peptide and protein complexes using complementary crystallographic and functional approaches. (3). Design and identify small molecules that regulate the interaction between tRXR? and its nongenomic coregulators. We will optimize compounds for stabilizing tRXR? tetramerization and for directly inhibiting coregulator binding. (4). Study the role of tRXR? and inhibitors in the development of the inflammatory tumor microenvironment using co-culture assays, and in the growth of tumor in nude and transgenic mice, which will also be used to evaluate inhibitors of nongenomic coregulators. Results obtained from this study should unravel fundamental regulatory mechanisms for the nongenomic action of RXR? (and perhaps other nuclear receptors), and may lead to the identification of new RXR? modulators for therapeutic intervention and mechanistic study."
"9616960","Project Summary/Abstract Project 1 will generate and use mouse models for studying how exposure to hepatotoxic Superfund substances causes fatty liver disease and its different manifestations, including inflammation, fibrosis and cancer. It has become increasingly clear that exposure to many industrial and environmental toxicants can cause toxicant- associated fatty liver disease (TAFLD) and its more serious form, toxicant-associated steatohepatitis (TASH), whose pathological signs are strikingly similar to those of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and non- alcoholic stateohepatits (NASH), respectively. As the pathogenic mechanisms underlying to TAFLD and TASH are poorly understood, we posit that better insight to toxicant-induced liver diseases can be gained from studying them along with NAFLD and NASH. Moreover, pre-existing NAFLD can increase the susceptibility of the liver to toxicant induced damage, further justifying the study of this metabolic condition that can progress to NASH or TASH and then to liver cirrhosis and cancer, diseases whose incidence is greater in economically disadvantaged Indian- and Mexican-American populations. During the past project period we obtained exciting and important preliminary results according to which the development and clinical progression of NASH and TASH are strongly modulated by two different populations of B lymphocytres, spleen-derived B2 B cells that promote fibrotic progression and IgA-producing plasmocytes that attenuate the onset of liver fibrosis, but favor the establishment of an immunosuppressive microenvironment permissive to the growth and progression of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Correspondingly, the specific targeting of IgA+ plasmocytes results in immune rejection of established HCC. To better understand the role of these B populations in the development and progression of NASH and TASH and to generate a new therapeutic approach to the treatment of toxicant-and obesity-induced liver cancer we will: 1) Define the pathways responsible for B cell recruitment into toxicant-damaged steatotic livers; 2) Determine how TASH and NASH trigger IgA class switch recombination (CSR) in liver-infiltrating B cells; 3) Determine how IgA+ plasmocytes attenuate NASH- and TASH-associated liver fibrosis; 4) Determine the role of T cell subsets and microbiota in the development of NASH and TASH; 5) identify secreted metabolites that along with IgA can be used for non-invasive detection of liver fibrosis; 6) determine the role of IgA+ plasmocytes in NASH and TASH progression to HCC. Our ability to accomplish these goals and gain a much better understanding of the immune mechanisms that affect the pathogenesis of NASH and TASH will be greatly enhanced by our research cores and the close collaborative interactions with other research projects."
"9452516","Abstract: Vaccines against devastating infectious diseases represent some of mankind's greatest medical breakthroughs. The underlying principle of vaccines is the establishment of immunity using attenuated or inactivated vectors that mimic the natural pathogen without causing the systemic damage a live infection can trigger. Thus the prerequisite for all successful vaccines to date is that the human immune system must be inherently capable of eventually generating adaptive immunity when faced with the natural live infection. In cases like polio, the damage achieved before adaptive immunity can control the natural virus is unacceptable; nevertheless, lasting immunity is ultimately achieved and protects against subsequent infections. Currently, however, many of the most problematic infectious diseases worldwide cannot be effectively controlled by the human immune system and do not elicit lasting immunity against re-infection. For example, by virtue of its mutability, HIV establishes chronic infections that cannot be cleared and are ineffectively controlled without the assistance of antiviral drugs. Dengue virus infection leads to lasting immunity against re- infection by the same serotype, but in fact causes far more severe disease if the individual is re-infected with a different Dengue serotype than if he/she were completely naïve. Similarly, influenza strains continuously alter themselves genetically; thus immunity to a given strain rarely affords complete protection against all subsequent influenza viruses that circulate in time and space. Natural infection with malaria does not necessarily lead to lasting immunity, as the same individual can be re-infected many times over the course of a lifetime. Pathogens like these thus pose a conundrum: how can vaccines designed to mimic the natural pathogen elicit immunity when the immune system is intrinsically incapable of generating broad and effective immunity when faced with the actual infection? Innovative alternate strategies, such as structure-guided sequential immunizations, gene therapy, and cell-based therapy have all been proposed, though the latter approach is the least developed. In this application, we thus focus on cell-based therapies and propose to 1) develop strategies to differentiate human pluripotent stem cells into transplantable pathogen-specific plasma cells, and 2) Use CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing to eliminate major determinants of immunogenicity from human pluripotent stem cells to allow scalable off-the-shelf therapies for infectious disease.    "
"9392912","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Corneal opacities, a leading cause of blindness worldwide, are commonly a result of stromal fibrosis or haze from dysregulated wound healing. Corneal wound healing is an enormously complex process that requires the simultaneous cellular integration of multiple soluble biochemical as well as biophysical cues associated with the wound space. Research from our laboratory and others have demonstrated biophysical attributes of the extracellular matrix profoundly modulate a host of fundamental cellular behaviors essential to the maintenance of homeostasis and wound repair including adhesion, migration, proliferation and differentiation. We have demonstrated that the intrinsic mechanical properties of the corneal stroma are significantly altered in a time dependent manner throughout wound healing. The matrix associated with the wound space was stiffest at 7 days with the greatest myofibroblast numbers and degree of stromal haze occurring at a later time point. This temporal relationship, combined with in vitro data documenting stiffer substrates to promote myofibroblast transformation, suggests a causal relationship. In Aim 1 we propose to directly modulate matrix stiffness in vivo using clinically relevant approaches and establish the impact of stiffening and softening of the wound matrix on wound healing outcomes using a well-defined rabbit PTK model. The complex inter-relationship between cytoskeletal dynamics and matrix remodeling and stiffness is central to determining wound healing outcomes but remains little investigated and poorly understood and are the central focus of Aim 2. Here, the impact of altering cytoskeletal dynamics in vitro on cell derived extracellular matrix elaboration, remodeling and mechanics, and the impact of altering cell derived matrix stiffness on keratocytes to myofibroblast transformation will be determined. Preliminary data demonstrate that the mechanical properties of ECM derived from cell in vitro can be modulated by applying diverse clinically relevant crosslinking methods. Preliminary data also document that modulating the cellular stiffness using drugs that alter the cytoskeleton can dramatically influence myofibroblast transformation. Stiffening of the cell promoted myofibroblast transformation. While softening of the cell inhibited transformation even in the presence of TGF? signaling. Additionally, the complex signaling dynamic that exist between stromal and epithelial cells will be investigated using a novel microfluidic co-culture platform in Aim 3. This novel system allows for the simultaneous presentation of multiple yet distinct biophysical and biochemical stimuli in addition to controlled exchange of soluble signaling molecules between epithelial and stromal cells. We will determine if soluble signals from the epithelial cells have a differential effect on KFM transformation under various biophysical stimuli. In aggregate the experiments detailed in this proposal are aimed at testing our central concept that optimal outcomes in corneal wound repair can be facilitated by engineering the intrinsic biophysical attributes of cells and/or matrices."

"9600122","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Dr. El Mallah is an Assistant Professor of Pediatrics, Pediatric Pulmonary Division, University of Florida, with 75% of time devoted to research, 25% to clinical. During the proposed award, her career development and learning objectives are to 1) acquire core knowledge in respiratory neurobiology and molecular therapy, 2) gain further expertise in research methodology, techniques, and scientific writing, and 3) develop academic leadership skills. Dr. El Mallah's long-term career goal is to become a successful independent pediatric pulmonary clinician scientist with an emphasis on translational research. As a result of her research she has published her findings, presented them at national meetings and has received several awards and grants, including the Parker B. Francis fellowship award. ENVIRONMENT: Drs. Fuller and Byrne are exceptional mentors, with a track record of successful mentees. Dr. Fuller is a leader in respiratory neurobiology, while Dr. Byrne is a national gene therapy expert. They both have extensive NIH funding, very active and productive laboratories, and will provide the resources to assist the candidate in her research project. The University of Florida (UF) Pediatric Department offers a structured scholars program designed to enhance research and leadership skills, and to give structured feedback and evaluations. UF also offers an employee education program to support coursework for the candidate. RESEARCH: The research project in this proposal will build on the candidate's prior research on targeting respiratory dysfunction in Pompe disease. In addition, it will explore a novel therapeutic agent for stimulating respiratory drive in a Pompe (Gaa-/-) mouse model. Pompe disease is a fatal neuromuscular disorder resulting from mutations in the gene for acid alpha- glucosidase (GAA) - an enzyme necessary to degrade lysosomal glycogen. Infants with Pompe disease suffer with respiratory insufficiency often leading to mechanical ventilation. Breathing problems have originally been attributed to muscle pathology but our group has recently shown a central nervous system contribution. Unfortunately, the only FDA approved therapy for Pompe disease (enzyme replacement therapy) is suboptimal because it does not cross the blood brain barrier. Therefore, many patients on enzyme replacement therapy still require mechanical ventilation. We propose a series of pre-clinical studies that directly address the need for treatment of the CNS in Pompe disease. Specifically, we will evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of ampakines, compounds that enhance excitatory glutaminergic neural transmission in respiratory neurons. In addition, since ampakines do not directly address the underlying pathology, we will use gene delivery to correct the underlying gene defect. Alone, gene delivery does not transduce the entire motoneuron pool and appears to only partially correct neural dysfunction. Therefore we propose to study the impact of ampakines on respiratory function following AAV gene therapy in Pompe mice in order to optimize therapy for respiratory dysfunction. Overall, this project will test an important and novel hypothesis and will provide the candidate with training in new experimental techniques. The fundamental hypothesis driving this proposal is that ampakine therapy will potentiate respiratory motor output in Pompe disease, and the function of these drugs will be further enhanced after CNS GAA activity is increased via AAV-based gene therapy. This will be examined using two specific aims: Aim 1: To test the hypothesis that ampakine therapy will stimulate respiratory drive in a mouse model of Pompe disease. Aim 2: To test the hypothesis that the efficacy of ampakine therapy will be further enhanced after CNS GAA activity is increased via AAV-based gene therapy. PROJECT RELEVANCE: This work is innovative because the impact of these excitatory agents, ampakines on respiratory dysfunction has not been evaluated in the context of neuromuscular disorders. Moreover, the ampakine treatments, which definitively work via a neural mechanism, will serve to emphasize the neural contribution to respiratory dysfunction in Pompe mice, and the necessity to target the CNS in order to treat this fatal disease. In addition, since both ampakines and AAV-GAA have already undergone phase I and II clinical trials and are safe for human use, this work has the strong potential to quickly translate to human care and to impact the clinical treatment of Pompe disease."

"9391029","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS) is a devastating premature aging disease. Children with HGPS exclusively die of heart attacks or strokes at an average age of 13 years. The majority of HGPS cases are caused by a mutation C1824T in the lamin A gene. This mutation activates a cryptic splicing site and produces a truncated lamin A mutant named progerin. It is unknown how progerin causes the life-threatening cardiovascular diseases in HGPS patients. Previous research revealed a profound phenotype of massive loss of smooth muscle cells (SMCs) in large arteries in both human patients and HGPS mouse models, strongly suggesting a connection of this phenotype with the cardiovascular malfunction and death associated with HGPS. The primary goal of this proposal is to elucidate the molecular pathway behind this phenotype. Based on a recent study from my group (Zhang et al., PNAS 2014), we hypothesize a mechanism that the presence of progerin destabilizes Poly [ADP-ribose] polymerase 1 (PARP1) protein and leads to the activation of non-homologous end joining (NHEJ), the error-prone DNA repair pathway. Consequently, the mis-repaired chromosomes encounter problems in mitosis, which results in mitotic catastrophe of HGPS SMCs. In this proposal, we propose to test this idea by (i) elucidating how progerin lead to PARP1 down- regulation, (ii) studying the consequence of PARP1 disruption in HGPS SMCs, and (iiI) determining whether attenuation of NHEJ can alleviate SMC loss in HGPS. We will use HGPS patient specific induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) to model SMC loss in vitro as well as apply mouse models of HGPS to test our hypothesis in vivo."
"9482095","Project Summary/Abstract Very few cases have been documented in which vaccine-elicited antibodies can bind to the Man1(alpha)-2Man1(alpha)-2Man ?tips? of Man8/9 high-mannose glycans that are prevalent on the HIV envelope protein. Rather, there is evidence that in most cases, vaccination with Man8/9 structures elicits antibodies that bind to the ?core? of the glycan, and pharmacokinetic literature data show that Man9 structures are rapidly trimmed to Man5/6 structures in vivo, on a timescale that may interfere with development of antibodies specific for Man9. The goal of this project is to test whether sustained immunogen delivery methods can increase the elicitation of antibodies specific for the intact Man8/9 glycans, by making intact glycan continuously available to the immune system."
