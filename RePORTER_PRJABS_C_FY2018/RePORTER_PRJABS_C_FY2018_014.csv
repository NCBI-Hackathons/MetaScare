9478006,"The aim of this Task Order modification is to support a pilot test to obtain medical claims data from Unlimited System, a medical claims aggregator (also referred to as a clearinghouse). Medical claims aggregators receive, edits, and submit insurance claims from medical practices. Working through a medical claims aggregator will ensure that this pilot test is conducted in the most efficient and cost effective manner because the desired oncology practice will be able to be recruited directly through the aggregator and once recruited the aggregator will directly submit their claims data. Also, since oncology practices are required to by law to submit data on newly diagnosed cases of cancer it is hoped that the option of claims aggregator submitted data will prove appealing. The goal of this pilot is to evaluate the feasibility of utilizing medical claims data to obtain longitudinal treatment data."

Advances in scientific research on the effects of various alcohol-related policies depend on well-measured indicators of these policies. Research in this important area has been constrained by limitations on the availability and quality of policy information. Initiatives to provide reliable information on public policies relating to alcohol must contend with the extraordinary complexity of alcohol policy in the United States. Laws, regulations, and jurisprudence address myriad aspects of alcoholic beverage production, packaging, transportation, marketing, taxation, sales, and consumption, as well as the financing and delivery of alcohol-related treatment and preventive services. Many of these policies are established by governments at all levels (Federal, State, county, and municipal). The National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) developed the Alcohol Policy Information System (APIS) to provide authoritative, detailed, and comparable information on alcohol-related public policies in the United States at both the State and Federal levels.

Initial fundamental activities to support the National Cancer Data Ecosystem include:  ? Establishing the ?blue print? to define the requirements of the fundamental infrastructure and components of the National Cancer Data Ecosystem and serve as a reference to the wider community that will contribute to and guide future activities of the NCI ? Identifying key data contributors, key data elements, and structured mechanisms for sharing these data elements to support various components of that National Cancer Data Ecosystem ? Building the infrastructure to enable data linkages, which is crucial to the interoperability of the National Cancer Data Ecosystem  The first two of these activities will require input and expertise from the community, which NCI will achieve by convening workshops to bring together critical stakeholders, including bioinformatics experts, IT experts, patient advocates, electronic medical record vendors, and cancer registries.  The third activity focuses on the ability to connect is the ability to connect disparate data sources at the patient-level, making it available to researchers, but without compromising patient privacy or confidentiality. This connectivity should include data generated from a variety of data sources and representing different aspects of each cancer patient's experience over time.  Linking data at the patient level poses a number of challenges, including: protecting patient confidentiality, data security, scalability and accuracy in linking the same patient assuring consistency of patient identifying information (PII) across a variety of sources that may hold different components of PII (e.g. name and date of birth versus SSN and date of birth).  This work will support the exploration of existing solutions to address these issues through the generation of encrypted unique patient identifiers to link individual patient data from disparate sources."
9569840,"The EAGeR trial was a multi-center, block-randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted across four medical centers in the U.S.. A total of 1228 women ages 18-40 years with up to two documented prior miscarriages and who planned to become pregnant again were randomized for this trial, making the EAGeR trial the largest preconception trial of LDA. Each woman was randomly assigned to 81 mg aspirin daily or placebo beginning prior to conception and continued to 36 weeks gestation in women achieving pregnancy. Participants were block randomized by study center and eligibility stratum, defined based on specific eligibility qualifications: 1) original stratum, women with exactly one documented pregnancy loss <20 weeks gestation during the preceding 12 months; and 2) expanded stratum, women not meeting all criteria for the original stratum, and having 1 or 2 prior pregnancy losses of any gestational age at any time in the past. Participants attended two study visits per menstrual cycle for the first two cycles attempting pregnancy and once per cycle thereafter, which included spot urine and blood sample collection. Follow-up ended after six menstrual cycles attempting pregnancy or, in women becoming pregnant, throughout pregnancy.  This proposal is to request funding for the measurement of stored biospecimens in the EAGeR Trial.  The assays proposed will provide a rich data source on biomarker levels that can be analyzed to answer novel research questions in conjunction with the extensive data already collected in the EAGeR Trial.

9420122,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Humans have a remarkable capacity to adapt to changing circumstances and learn new information from feedback in the environment. Failures to use feedback to adapt or maintain behavior are implicated in a wide variety of brain disorders, including schizophrenia 1, addiction 2, autism 3, Parkinson's disease 4,5, Tourette syndrome 6, and attention deficit hyperactive disorder 6. A better understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying feedback processing and learning has the potential to bridge neuroscience research across a range of species and theoretical and methodological frameworks, and to help gain insight into brain disorders. This project examines the mechanisms of positive and negative feedback-guided learning in healthy humans from a physiologically inspired perspective centered on large-scale brain networks and how they interact through synchronized electrophysiological rhythms 7,8. We focus on rhythms hypothesized to index frontal cortical mechanisms that compute and communicate the need for adjustment or maintenance of current information processing across broad networks during learning. We combine high-density electroencephalographic (EEG) measurements of synchronized rhythms with high definition transcranial direct-current stimulation (HD-tDCS) 9,10 to determine whether it is possible to modify components of frontal activity and cause bi-directional changes in next-trial behavior and learning success. Our preliminary data are highly encouraging and indicate that we can causally manipulate the timing of low-frequency rhythmic activity, and improve or impair learning measured behaviorally. The goals of the research program are to use novel neuroscience tools and analysis procedures to gain a deeper understanding of the cognitive mechanisms underlying the flexible adjustment of behavior and learning, and contribute new knowledge to the development of effective, non-pharmacological interventions for improving cognition in healthy and patient populations."

9563035,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the leading causes of cancer-related mortality worldwide. While the five-year survival rate for localized CRC is excellent at 90%, more than half of new CRC cases have the disease spread to regional lymph nodes and/or distant organs at the time of diagnosis. CRC with distant metastasis has a dismal five-year survival rate of 13.5%. These data clearly indicate that CRC-related mortality can be significantly improved if the disease is detected early. Risk factors for CRC include age (>50), race (African American), obesity, cigarette smoking, type II diabetes, history of inflammatory bowel diseases, family history of colorectal polyps or CRC, and inherited genetic syndromes known to increase the CRC risks, such as familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) and Lynch syndrome. FAP and Lynch syndrome are caused by germline mutations in the APC gene and DNA mismatch repair (MMR) genes, respectively. The management of individuals with hereditary gastrointestinal cancer syndromes requires additional measures beyond what is recommended for the average-risk population to minimize the overall risk of cancer-associated morbidity and mortality.        Fusobacteria are common human oral gram-negative anaerobic microflora isolated from dental plaque and gum diseases, but rarely detectable in the colorectum of healthy individuals. In recent years, the enrichment of a specific pathotype, Fusobacterium nucleatum (Fn), has been demonstrated in the colonic tissues and stools from patients with colorectal adenomas and CRC. Clinical evidence suggests that the prevalence of Fn progressively increases from dysplasia, adenomas to CRC, and the higher amount of Fn is significantly associated with CRC with high microsatellite instability (MSI-high), which is caused by DNA MMR deficiencies as seen in Lynch syndrome-associated CRC. The potential association of Fn with CRC tumorigenesis has been examined in a mouse model of FAP. ApcMin/+ mice, which carry a nonsense mutation at codon 850 of the Apc gene (Apc?850), had a significantly accelerated onset and increased multiplicity of both small intestinal and colorectal tumors after oral inoculation of Fn. These data strongly suggested the tumor-promoting role of Fn in ApcMin/+ mice.       Although how Fn contributes to CRC tumorigenesis has yet to be fully elucidated, emerging evidence points to its two virulence factors, FadA and Fap2, as potential enhancers of CRC tumorigenesis and progression. FadA adhesin, which is expressed on the bacterial surface, mediates Fn attachment and invasion of endothelial and epithelial cells. A recent study has shown that the Fn FadA binds to E-cadherin and activates Wnt/?-catenin signaling, resulting in increased cell proliferation in human colon cancer cells. Disruption of FadA and E-cadherin binding by synthetic inhibitory peptides significantly reduced Fn-driven CRC cell proliferation in vitro and tumor growth in vivo. In the clinical setting, the increased level of FadA expression has been demonstrated in colonic adenoma and CRC tissues obtained from human patients. The Fn Fap2 protein is another virulence factor suggested to play a role in Fn-associated CRC tumorigenesis in humans. The Fap2 binds to human T-cell immunoglobulin ITIM domain (TIGIT), an immunoglobulin superfamily receptor known to function as an immune co-inhibitory molecule. Its ligands, CD155 and CD112, are expressed on antigen presenting cells, T cells as well as on a variety of tumor cells. Fap2-binding to TIGIT on NK and other T cells protects tumor cells from NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity and blocks effector T cell functions in the tumor microenvironment. TIGIT has also been shown to promote Treg function. Taken together, Fn may exert tumor promoting effects not only by promoting CRC tumor growth via activation of Wnt/?-catenin signaling pathway, but also by exploiting the immune-suppressive function of TIGIT via the Fap2 protein and contributing to tumor immune evasion mechanisms.      Prophylactic vaccines for human papillomavirus (HPV) and hepatitis B virus (HBV) have been associated with significant reductions in infection rates, which are expected to result in the dramatic decrease in the incidence of cervical cancers and hepatocellular carcinoma, respectively. Compared to the prevention of infection, the eradication of oncogenic infectious agents from the host is in general highly challenging, if not impossible. Nontheless, the host immune defense system may be fortified by pathogen-targeted vaccines, if they can boost anti-pathogen immunity and lead to the containment of infection or suppression of pathogen-mediated tumorigenic functions.       As with other gram-negative bacteria, Fn produces outer membrane vesicles (OMVs), which contain much of the biological content of the Fn, but without replicative capacity. OMVs are naturally secreted, bi-layered lipid membrane nanostructures of 20-250 nm in size, and are highly stable and immunogenic. OMVs can also be engineered to express specific antigens, while genetically altered to reduce the endotoxicity. As has been demonstrated with the successful development of highly efficacious OMV based anti-meningococcal serogroup B vaccines (i.e. Trumenba and Bexsero), Fn OMV may be used as anti-Fn vaccines to elicit immunity that would reduce Fn colonization. The current project will attempt to develop Fn OMV based vaccines (Fn vaccines), which will result in the reduction of Fn colonization in the intestine and colorectum and in turn reduction of the CRC risk in individuals with FAP and Lynch syndrome as well as in other high-risk cohorts."

CGEMS has developed into a robust research program involving genome-wide association studies (GWASs) for a number of cancers to identify common genetic variants that affect a person's risk of developing cancer. In collaboration with extramural scientists, NCI's Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG) has carried out genome-wide scans for common and/or highly lethal cancers extensively studied by the Division. CGEMS relies upon data from the NCI Consortium as well as collaborative case-control epidemiologic studies with biospecimens. By scanning the DNA collected from individuals participating in these cohort or case-control studies, scientists have identified common inherited genetic variants associated with cancer risk that may lead to new preventive, diagnostic, and therapeutic interventions. The pooling of large data sets provides the statistical power to quantify the risks associated with specific gene variants and exposures, and enables subset analyses that uncover gene-gene and gene-environment interactions. Researchers are applying fine-mapping and deep sequencing techniques to regions or loci identified by these scans to pinpoint the specific functional variants responsible for disease risk and the biologic mechanisms involved. Ultimately, findings from these studies may yield new preventive, diagnostic, and therapeutic interventions for cancer."

It is envisioned that initiation of this consortium will provide cutting-edge chemical tools for probing complex signaling pathways and will serve as the starting point for the elaboration of first-in-class targeted therapies. The CBC will be an integrated research consortium at the interface of chemical biology and molecular oncology that will, working with various programs within DCTD and CCR, establish an iterative cancer drug discovery group on the scale of a small biotechnology concern. The goal of the CBC will be to focus on unmet therapeutic needs in oncology that are not currently addressed by the private sector. The long-term vision of the CBC is to bridge the gap between basic scientific investigation and clinical research supported by the NCI as the first step in re-establishing the NCI as a world leader in the area of innovative cancer therapeutics discovery.  To address this challenge and to ensure that NCI re-emerges as a strong and flexible player in the national cancer therapeutics discovery arena, we propose to develop a national effort in coordinated cancer drug discovery that unites academic and small biotechnology chemical biology and molecular oncology groups with the later-stage drug development resources of the NCI's Developmental Therapeutics Program (DTP). This unique effort will:    1. Focus on the identification of novel targets, and the development of new molecules to interrogate those targets and serve as lead structures around which potential drugs can be designed and tested by a restructured NCI therapeutics pipeline. This will be accomplished, in part, by establishing a consortium of chemists, chemical biologists, and molecular oncologists, formed in recognition of the increasing need for a highly interdisciplinary and creative team research effort in drug discovery, that will propel the NCI into the era of personalized therapeutic cancer medicine. These teams will be formed with funding through the use of NCI contracts, NCI-SAIC subcontracts, or NCI grants mechanisms, whichever is most expedient and appropriate to the scientific expertise required.  2. Establish an iterative drug discovery effort that will coalesce all segments of the current NCI therapeutics research activity, so that the development of promising chemical leads into bone fide clinical candidates can be accelerated  3. Build an enhanced, and robust drug pipeline with the goal of producing a new clinical agent for first-in-human clinical testing in the fourth quarter of 2009  The integrated process outlined here will allow NCI to maximize the return on its investment in molecular oncology over the past decade by consolidating and coordinating the essential chemical and biological technologies that are available and necessary for therapeutics development. This initiative will also streamline the therapeutics development workflow for chemists and biologists in academia and small business by enhancing the scientific infrastructure available to move their molecules along the entire drug development pipeline into first-in-human clinical trials. We believe that the NCI Chemical Biology Consortium will provide the new strategic approach that is required for NCI to re-establish itself as a world leader in anticancer drug discovery and development."

9430122,"Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is a multifactoral disease, and a large proportion of patients affected with either type 1 or type 2 diabetes develop diabetic nephropathy and progress to end stage renal disease (ESRD). When poor prognostic factors such as hypertension and chronic hyperglycemia are aggressively treated, the rate of progression of diabetic nephropathy can be slowed. However, no interventions have been shown to reliably halt the progression of diabetic nephropathy. Numerous studies have suggested that genetic predisposition to diabetic nephropathy exists, but genes for nephropathy have not yet been isolated. It is anticipated that a comprehensive analysis of a large number of uniformly phenotyped ESRD families will be necessary to isolated genes for ESRD. Such a database of families may not be available at any single institution. The charge of the FIND consortium was to acquire sets of families and individuals with well-characterized diabetic nephropathy, establish a secure master FIND database, and use genetic technologies to identify chromosomal regions linked with diabetic nephropathy in order to identify diabetic nephropathy susceptibility or protection genes. A Repository of samples collected during the FIND is essential for the FIND study to achieve its goals and for subsequent studies of this valuable sample collection."
9539090,"Shade helps people manage their UV exposure_ it is a ultraviolet (UV) monitor with unprecidented accuracy connected to a mobile application. Although it is one of the clearest and most controllable causes of cancer, UV exposure can be difficult to estimate due to the importance of combining many rapidly changing factors including intensity, shade, and use of protective cloting and sunscreen. To validate Shade in a short study we enroll a highly susceptable population, transplant patients taking immunosupressive drugs. Kidney tranplant patients have 65 times higher risk for developing squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), and once diagnosed they have a far higher rate of developing metasteses and dying. SCC develops from precancerous, UV triggered actinic keratosis, a lesion with remarkably high prevalence in this population. This project will accomplish the following (1) recruit transplant patients undergoing regular skin checks, (2) provide them with Shade, (3) validate that Shade users see a decrease in symptoms and markers of UV exposure by dermatologist observation of actinic keratosis, and by a reduction in cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers a biomarker of UV exposure, and (4) observe changes in understanding of UV exposure through completion of a UV education survey at the beginning and end of the study."

9569764,"The Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) Study was initiated in 1985 with two components: community-based surveillance and a prospective cohort study. The community surveillance aimed to monitor trends in hospitalized myocardial infarction (MI), fatal coronary heart disease (CHD) in four U.S. communities: Forsyth County, NC; Jackson, MS; suburbs of Minneapolis, MN; and Washington County, MD. Surveillance for hospitalized heart failure (HF) events was added in 2005. The communities were selected to provide data across four (4) geographic locations with a range of mortality rates, in urban, suburban, and rural settings. The cohort study aimed to investigate the risk factors for and natural history of atherosclerosis and development of clinical atherosclerosis in middle-aged white or African American adults from the same communities. The study recruited in 15,792 white or African American participants initially aged 45-64 years and selected participants received triennial clinical exams over the first ten years of the study (1987-1989, 1990-1992, 1993-1995, and 1996-1998), with a fifth clinical exam in 2011-2013, providing a rich set of data on physical, behavioral, genetic, and psychosocial factors. Since 1988, the cohort has been contacted annually and in 2011 semiannual follow-up was initiated. Findings have been presented in over 1,400 publications as of 2014.

9430054,"The major functions of this laboratory under Thomas McCloud are related to the preparation of extracts from natural product sources (marine invertebrates, plants and microbes) with the aim of producing materials for use in cancer related studies both in intramural and extramural laboratories and locations., The materials are subsequently ?plated? in 96 and 384 well plates, and the production of solubilized materials, both extracts and synthetic compounds for subsequent 60 cell line cancer cell assays and other, usually molecular target assays of interest to the DTP in support of cancer drug development. In addition, the laboratory performs a ?dereplication? function for hits from various anti-cancer assays, thus enabling a decision to be rapidly made concerning continuation of work on a particular ?hit?. As a result of the dereplication effort, significant numbers of ?fraction plates? have been amassed thus permitting relatively easy access to prefractionated samples if the same or similar extracts ?hit? in a different assay related to cancer.  The laboratory also is utilized for rapid Quality Control and identification work on potential anticancer agents from a variety of sources of interest to the Developmental Therapeutics Program as part of cancer drug discovery and development. There is also the capability to isolate and purify small molecules of interest from a variety of sources and to perform some structure activity work via semisynthesis when/where necessary. In addition with the in vivo assays related to crude extracts, as these results come in, the laboratory will be performing initial chemical assessments on the hits.  As the Chemical Biology Consortium initiative ramps up, this laboratory will become the focal point for a number of initial steps in that process; viz extract preparation and plate production, initial dereplication and in certain cases identification of lead compounds from a variety of assays."
9545268,"RNA-based vaccines and therapeutics have emerged as great promise for HIV prevention and treatment, respectively. However, many obstacles still need to be overcome, in particular RNA instability, manufacturing problems, and clinically relevant delivery mechanisms of RNA into target cells. RNA vaccine approaches have some advantages in relation to other vaccine technologies; they can be delivered directly into the cytoplasm and do not require nuclear localization to generate expression. Improvements of methods for mRNA synthesis and stabilization and development of improved self-amplifying RNAs have recently yielded promising results. RNA approaches also stimulate the host?s innate defense system, in part through activation of the TLR pathways that recognize single and double stranded RNAs. Furthermore, RNA-based therapeutics have shown the potential to silence HIV effectively upon direct transfection in vitro, but delivery into cells in vivo is still unsatisfactory. Vector-based (lentivirus, adeno-associated virus) delivery to quiescent cells has proven inefficient, and the vectors themselves pose a risk to the host. The primary goal of this contract solicitation is to develop improved platform technologies for the delivery of RNA into specific cells and tissues to improve the efficacy of HIV vaccines or therapeutics. Examples of HIV RNA vaccines include, but are not limited to mRNA and self-amplifying RNAs. Examples of RNA therapeutics include small interfering RNA (siRNA), microRNA (miRNA), microRNA antagonists, aptamers, messenger RNA (mRNA), splice-switching oligonucleotides, antisense oligonucleotides, and plasmid or other circular DNAs encoding messenger RNAs and transcription regulatory sequences. To enhance the efficacy of traditional HIV vaccines and therapeutics, combinations of cytokines, adjuvants, broadly neutralizing monoclonal antibodies, immune checkpoint inhibitors, etc. can also be co-delivered in mRNA form.

Unavailability of three-dimensional (3D) tissue culture model systems that mimics the original tumor?s architecture and molecular characteristics of the racially disparate breast tumors limits our advancement in this area. The overall goal of this SBIR Phase-I proposal is to develop a standardized protocol for the establishment of a three-dimensional (3D) tissue culture model system using tumor mass from breast cancer patients of African American and Caucasian American racial/ethnic background. We will achieve overall goal in three parts: ?A? development of 3D-tissue culture model system from racially disparate breast tumors; ?B? phenotypic characterization of the developed 3D model system to confirm their stability and; ?C? functional characterization and technical validation of the developed 3D-tissue culture models. Successful completion of this highly innovative proposal will result in a novel phenotypically stable 3D-culture model system that will be a landmark in BC racial disparity research. Moreover, this will provide a strong foundation for our next step, in that we will pursue a Phase II for developing up to 50 3D-tissue culture model system for racially disparate BC of different molecular subtypes."

9453385,"Project Abstract From 2007 to 2009, there was record high job loss in the United States with almost one out of every six workers reporting a job loss, leaving both the public and researchers worried about the long-term adverse consequences of unemployment for population health. While earlier cohorts of Americans could anticipate relatively stable employment across the life course, recent cohorts have experienced more layoffs, shutdowns, and increasingly unstable work, whereby they have increasingly varied unemployment experiences by midlife. Moreover, even short-term experiences of perceived job instability are related to declines in health, suggesting that long-term unemployment risks may have profound and enduring health consequences. Yet there is scant research on the impact to health of risk of job loss over time. This project will (1) identify group-based trajectories of unemployment risk experienced by men and women across the life course, (2) identify life course and labor market risk factors associated with greater unemployment risk across ages 25-45 and (3) apply multinomial treatment models to estimate the relationships between pathways of unemployment risk and likelihood to experience hypertension, stroke, arthritis, or other chronic diseases at age 50 that remain leading causes of hospitalization and death in the US. Identifying patterns of unemployment over time and how they connect to health could lead to targeted unemployment policies that will directly improve population health. Amidst heightened concerns about unemployment and economic instability in the wake of the Great Recession, these questions have direct relevance to keeping the American workforce healthier in the future."

9531520,"Despite recent advances in immunotherapy and molecularly targeted therapies for advanced melanoma, early detection remains the most effective means of preventing death from melanoma. Currently, physicians have no uniform way to efficiently and effectively teach the 3.79 million people at-risk to develop melanoma how to check their skin for melanoma. Melanoma patients are not provided with communication materials to inform their first degree relatives of their risk of developing melanoma and how to engage their relatives in managing their risk by performing skin self-examination to improve early detection of melanoma and their survival from this deadly disease. The weakness in the current health care system result in undue anxiety among relatives of melanoma patients, unnecessary visits to the dermatologist with unnecessary skin biopsies, and increased cost to the health care system. Through a RCT, we will validate the use of Eviderma that extends the proven physician-to physician consultation of the Vignet Mobile Telederm system to provide melanoma patients and their first-degree relatives education about their risk of developing melanoma and the importance of early detection, teach the skills to perform SSE, provide diaries for home use and access to dermatologists. The melanoma patient and relative will download the Eviderma and self report their adherence to their care plan by learning how to perform SSE, report their SSE results, and send the dermatologist a picture of a pigmented lesion (mole), and the dermatologist will recommend next steps.   We hypothesize that melanoma patients and first-degree relatives, who use Eviderma, will a) improve their awareness of being at-risk of developing melanoma, importance of early detection, and SSE performance, b) learn to engage dermatologists effectively and efficiently for skin examination of concerning lesions, and c) disseminate it to friends and relatives. We will conduct a randomized clinical trial in order to develop and rigorously test Eviderma. In addition, we will assess the direct costs such as physician visits for screening, biopsy of concerning moles and the pathologic interpretation as well as the projected cost of care of advanced melanoma when early detection failed. Indirect costs for the patient, including travel, time lost from work and family will also be assessed. The impact of a successful trial should be to fill the current gap in the care of melanoma patients and their first-degree relatives, reduce health care costs, improve patient adherence to SSE performance, detect melanoma in the curable stage, and reduce mortality."

The NIAID, Division of AIDS has a requirement for a comprehensive and uniform approach to evaluate initial and on-going laboratory capability and readiness to carry out NIAID-funded clinical trial protocols outside the U.S. NIAID places the highest priority on ensuring the safety and optimal management of subjects who participate in its clinical trials and on obtaining reliable laboratory-based data critical for the meaningful interpretation of study findings. Equally important is the safety of those who perform the laboratory testing. Clinical laboratories in the U.S. are required to meet Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) performance standards and participate in a variety of external proficiency testing programs. Though non-U.S. accreditation organizations and providers of proficiency testing programs exist, these vary significantly in their requirements and level of oversight of clinical laboratories.  The purpose of the Patient Safety Monitoring in International Laboratories (SMILE) contract is to provide a comprehensive and uniform approach to evaluate initial and on-going laboratory capability and readiness to carry out NIAID-funded clinical trial protocols by (1) monitoring laboratories compliance with Good Clinical Laboratory Practices (GCLP), (2) monitoring the ability of laboratories to reliably perform protocol-specified tests by evaluating results obtained with panels of coded samples, (3) providing Labs with various means of assistance, guidance and training to address and prevent recurrence of deficiencies in GCLP and/or proficiency testing, and (4) maintaining a computerized data management system and document library that include lab performance data and guidance documents."
9437001,"Malaria was responsible for 212 million of clinical cases in 2015. Plasmodium vivax is the most prevalent of the human malaria parasites and account for an estimated 41% of the malaria burden. P. vivax and P. ovale are characterized by their ability to produce undetectable dormant stages in the liver known as hypnozoites that can result in relapse infections weeks to months after the primary infection. Progress on the assessment of the molecular makeup of these parasite forms has been hindered by the biological constraints of these malaria parasite species that cannot be continuously cultured in vitro and to the challenging of studying relapsing in the limited number of experimental animal models available. The development of new tools for in vivo study of relapsing malaria parasites is, therefore, a research priority. This proposal will build on our experience working with simian malaria parasites and non-human primates to create a fully simianized mouse model to study relapsing parasites. The main goal is to develop a model that consistently reproduces the liver stage development of relapsing malaria parasites in vivo. In Aim 1 we will generate a simianized liver chimeric mice able to support the growth of simian relapsing malaria parasites. In Aim 2 we will assess the value of developing fully simianized mice to understand anti-liver stage immune responses with emphasis on the impact of pre-erythrocytic stage immunity on hypnozoites. The comprehensive characterization of experimental infections in the proposed animal model will provide opportunities to define novel biomarker for detection of hypnozoites and to understand compartmentalized immune responses in search of novel targets for interventions."

9430253,"This research study aims to increase understanding of factors that predict poor asthma  control during pregnancy as well as add to our knowledge of the basic immunology of  pregnancy. Asthma is a common chronic disease and some women experience  exacerbation and worsening of their asthma during pregnancy while others improve.  Change in asthma severity/control in pregnancy has been noted frequently  in the literature (about one-third worsen and one-third improve) but this change is not  explored in any depth 1? Patients with asthma may have a defect in regulatory T (Treg)  cells, which favors further T H2-cell proliferation2. Treg cells are integral to the process by  which the immune system differentiates foreign antigens (pathogens, etc.) and self  antigens and, as such, they also play a key role in mediating pregnancy tolerance3?  Treg can be measured in peripheral blood and the levels vary over the course of  pregnancy and post-partum as well as across the menstrual cycle. Foxp3 is the primary  gene responsible for Treg regulation.  We will investigate predictors of asthma control variability during pregnancy including  demographic, biologic, genetic and environmental factors with particular interest in  the role of maternal allergy. Pregnancy requires the immune system to tolerate the  not self fetus and the clinical presentation of asthma including improvement or  worsening will contribute to knowledge of the basic immunology of pregnancy.  Women who get worse during pregnancy may represent a vulnerable subgroup with  respect to environmental exposures, such as poor air quality, which can exacerb  asthma and may have an independent effect on poor pregnancy outcomes."

9578288,"There is an urgent need for more effective drug delivery agents for treatment of brain tumors, which are among the most aggressive and intractable cancers. SapC-DOPS, a nanovesicle composed of saposin C (SapC) coupled to dioleoylphosphatidylserine (DOPS), has proven tumor targeting properties, which include crossing the blood-brain tumor barrier and binding the lipid tumor marker, extracellular phosphatidylserine (PS). It also exhibits antitumor activities in preclinical glioblastoma (GBM) models. We hypothesize that endowing SapC-DOPS nanovesicles with a radiolabeled lipophilic reporter will create a novel agent with superior efficacy for targeted radionuclide therapy (TRT) of GBMs. Treatment options for GBMs are very limited, and standard therapies with radiation and/or chemotherapy provide only modest survival benefits with potential deleterious effects. To address these issues, we propose to create a novel cancer-selective, targeted radiolabeled SapC-DOPS for TRT of GBMs. A unique advantage of MTTI's approach lies in the feedforward therapeutic mechanism of the novel compound: radiation exposure is known to increase PS externalization in tumor cells, thus leading to enhanced anticancer effects by PS-targeted SapC-DOPS nanovesicles. This proposal is backed by extensive, published and unpublished, preliminary data, the FDA Orphan Drug designation of SapC-DOPS, and an ongoing clinical phase I trial."

9566448,"Mortality rates for colorectal cancer (CRC) vary according to geographic region, gender, age, ethnicity, and diet/lifestyle factors. Genetic influences also contribute to the etiology of CRC, for both sporadic cases and hereditary syndromes, such as familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP). Risk?reducing surgical intervention in FAP patients often is coupled to prevention strategies using NSAIDs (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs). However, none of these agents is completely effective against adenoma growth in the GI tract, and Sulindac continues to be viewed as the standard of care in many clinical settings. Sulindac is effective in preclinical FAP models, including the Apc?driven polyposis. Recent clinical trials (Samadder et al., JAMA 315:1266-1275, 2016) using a combination regimen of Sulindac administered twice/day with daily erlotinib for 6 months was shown to be effective in reducing the duodenal polyp burden in patients with FAP. However, the toxicity of the two drugs in combination may not allow long term treatment in a prevention setting. The purpose of this Task Order is to determine the optimal dosing and/or scheduling of erlotinib and Sulindac, individually and in combination, which reduce the toxicities associated with these drugs while maintaining or improving efficacy of the treatment regimens administered at animal equivalent dose levels; to determine the effects of the agents on tumor parameters in small intestinal compared to lower colonic tumors; to assess the effects of long term agent exposure on the potential to develop resistance; and assess pharmacodynamic markers predictive of agent efficacy."

9574781,"African-American men have the highest incidence of prostate cancer (PCa) are more than twice as likely to die than Caucasian men in the US. Underlying factors that cause this disparity have yet to be confirmed in functional studies as representative in vitro models are not readily available to the research community. This problem has two origins. First, a diverse source of PCa tumor cells from representative racial and ethnic backgrounds does not currently exist. Second, the inaccuracy of two-dimensional (2D) cancer drug screening models in predicting in vivo tumor responses in patients is a major hurdle for effective candidate drug selection and contributes to the high rate of cancer drug clinical failures. This compounds the difficulty of assessing potentially subtle biological factors that may contribute to cancer health disparities (CHD). In this proposal, Mimetas and its collaborators at Rice University will develop and demonstrate the feasibility of a racially diverse population of PDX derived PCa cultures of Caucasian, Hispanic, and African-American origin in Mimetas 3D OncoPlate high-throughput platform containing 96 ex vivo micro tumors.

9545265,"RNA-based vaccines and therapeutics have emerged as great promise for HIV prevention and treatment, respectively. However, many obstacles still need to be overcome, in particular RNA instability, manufacturing problems, and clinically relevant delivery mechanisms of RNA into target cells. RNA vaccine approaches have some advantages in relation to other vaccine technologies; they can be delivered directly into the cytoplasm and do not require nuclear localization to generate expression. Improvements of methods for mRNA synthesis and stabilization and development of improved self-amplifying RNAs have recently yielded promising results. RNA approaches also stimulate the host?s innate defense system, in part through activation of the TLR pathways that recognize single and double stranded RNAs. Furthermore, RNA-based therapeutics have shown the potential to silence HIV effectively upon direct transfection in vitro, but delivery into cells in vivo is still unsatisfactory. Vector-based (lentivirus, adeno-associated virus) delivery to quiescent cells has proven inefficient, and the vectors themselves pose a risk to the host. The primary goal of this contract solicitation is to develop improved platform technologies for the delivery of RNA into specific cells and tissues to improve the efficacy of HIV vaccines or therapeutics. Examples of HIV RNA vaccines include, but are not limited to mRNA and self-amplifying RNAs. Examples of RNA therapeutics include small interfering RNA (siRNA), microRNA (miRNA), microRNA antagonists, aptamers, messenger RNA (mRNA), splice-switching oligonucleotides, antisense oligonucleotides, and plasmid or other circular DNAs encoding messenger RNAs and transcription regulatory sequences. To enhance the efficacy of traditional HIV vaccines and therapeutics, combinations of cytokines, adjuvants, broadly neutralizing monoclonal antibodies, immune checkpoint inhibitors, etc. can also be co-delivered in mRNA form. The short-term goal of this project is to perform feasibility studies for the development and use of delivery mechanisms for RNA-based HIV vaccines and therapies. The long-term goal of this project is to enable a small business to bring fully developed delivery systems for RNA-based HIV vaccines and therapies to the clinic and eventually to the market."

Subsequently, coded compounds will be studied by determining whether selected doses, administered pre-session, reduce the discriminative-stimulus effects of cocaine (pretreatment) and/or whether selective doses of the compound itself can produce cocaine-like effects (substitution). In the drug self-administration paradigm, Mm will be prepared with indwelling IV catheters, and trained to self-administer IV cocain in daily sessions that also include food self-administration components. Each coded compound will be tested in Mm in which the dose-response function for IV cocaine self-administration has been determined. In the pretreatment protocol, tests will be conducted, first, to identify a pretreatment dose that reduces self-administration of the peak reinforcing unit dose of IV cocaine without greatly altering food self-administration, and second, to determine how that dose alters the cocaine dose response function for IV self-administration.

Contracts were awarded to ten Clinical Centers to recruit, enroll, and follow patients to monitor clinical responsiveness to study treatments, to assess growth and development, and to monitor for toxicity from study treatments. Surrogate markers of end organ damage were used to evaluate pulmonary, renal, splenic, and brain function as well as developmental milestones. One Medical Coordinating Center was awarded to oversee drug distribution, coordinate central laboratory functions, perform data collection and analysis, and conduct clinical sites visits to monitor study performance. The trial enrolled 193 subjects with SCD between the ages of 9 and 17 months from October 2003 to June 2007. Subjects remained on study drug for a period of two years. HU demonstrated substantial clinical benefit without serious toxicity in this cohort of very young children. In 2008, a follow-up study was added to the contracts to provide structured follow-up of the children after they completed their two years on study drug. The purpose of the initial Follow-Up Study is to characterize the long-term toxicities and unexpected risks (if any) associated with treatment with HU at an early age.

9607211,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT The memory CD8 T cell compartment can be activated by inflammatory cues even in the absence of a T cell receptor signal. This process is referred to as bystander-activation of memory T cells and has been observed following different infections. The contribution of these cells to host immunity was poorly understood until we recently reported that bystander-activated memory CD8 T cells play a crucial role in controlling early pathogen replication following infection. We demonstrated that bystander-activated memory CD8 T cells express granzyme B and can directly kill target cells in a TCR-independent, innate-like fashion. In stark contrast to their beneficial effect for host immunity following infection, our most recent data provide strong evidence that these bystander-activated T cells decrease antigen availability following vaccination by eliminating antigen- presenting cells. We propose to test the hypothesis that bystander-activated memory CD8 T cells play a fundamental and thus far unappreciated role in directly controlling the size of the cellular and humoral immune response following vaccination. We will determine which memory T cell subsets are capable of becoming bystander-activated, identify how bystander-activated T cells affect subsequent adaptive immune responses and define the mechanisms that lead to decreased antigen availability following vaccination. We will use a mouse model system to define the underlying mechanisms of target cell elimination and primary human T cells ex vivo to ensure direct relevance for human health. This proposal is highly significant because addressing the role of bystander-activated memory T cells in a vaccine context is one of the most significant and pressing cellular immunology research topics due to the inability to achieve effective immunity by vaccination in select populations at risk for and most susceptible to infections. This proposal is highly innovative because we identified NKG2D as a key molecule in this process and engineered a novel antagonist designed to enhance vaccine efficacy by inhibiting bystander-activated CD8 T cell function. Our proposed experiments clearly define the impact of bystander-activation on subsequent immune responses and to provide a new strategy for enhancing vaccine efficacy."

9571108,"There is a demand for estrogen-free contraception in order to reduce the risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE), particularly for obese women. A new oral contraceptive agent consisting of a progesterone receptor modulator, which does not affect endogenous estrogen levels, has been developed. Ulipristal acetate (UPA) has been used in a single high dose for emergency contraception and has been used continuously for up to six months for treatment of uterine fibroids. Low dose continuous usage of oral UPA is anticipated to inhibit ovulation and provide an estrogen free, bleed free method of contraception.   The Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institutes of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) has a mission to develop safe and effective contraceptives for women, including obese women. Obesity is the number one public health issue facing the US population and is an independent risk for venous thromboembolism (VTE). Therefore, there is a public health need to develop effective contraception for woman that does not increase the risk of VTE. One Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved contraceptive method is the progestin-only pill (POP). This method requires strict adherence to taking the POP at the same time every day. The method is associated with irregular bleeding which often leads to discontinuation of the method. Daily low dose oral progesterone receptor modulators (PRMs), such as UPA, have been shown to inhibit ovulation and cause amenorrhea. The endogenous estrogen level is not affected by the PRM. Thus, the method will provide a regimen that is easier to follow than POP regimen and have a theoretically lower risk of VTE, especially for obese women. In addition, there is in vitro evidence that UPA may have protective activity against breast cancer. In order to provide preliminary evidence that daily, low dose UPA could be effective for contraception, a clinical trial will be conducted in the NICHD Contraceptive Clinical Trials Network (CCTN). The proposed study will be evaluated sequentially. Initially, women of reproductive age, with normal menstrual cycles, will receive treatment for 12 weeks (three 28-day cycles) in order to evaluate the mechanisms of contraceptive efficacy, safety and acceptability of this new contraceptive."

9589075,"Abstract Background:  Harmful drinking among women is increasing at an alarming rate.  The 2012-2013 National Epidemiological Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC) III found that Alcohol Use Disorder affects about 14% of the U.S. population, including 10% of women.  This represents a doubling of the prevalence of AUD among women since the completion of the 2001- 2002 NESARC I, when AUD was found to affect 5% of U.S. women.  A 2009 analysis of data from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) found a 30% increase in binge drinking among women 18 to 23 yrs. of age from 1979 ? 2006. (J Am Acad Child Adolscnt Psych; 7/09).  In 2015 NIAAA staff published a follow-up analysis of NSDUH data, finding that binge drinking increased 12% among women > 21 yrs. from 2002-2012. (White, et al; ACER, 2015)  The CDC reports binge drinking in 1 in 5 high school girls, and 1 in 8 women aged 18 yrs. and older, while 24% of women 18-24 yrs. engage in binge drinking.  (CDC Vital Signs; 1/13) According to data from the Federal Bureau of Investigation, in 2011 nearly one out of four DUI arrests in the United States involved a female driver, a dramatic increase since1980, when women made up less than one in ten DWI arrests nationwide.  DUI arrests for women have increased 30% in just the past decade.    One of the most serious potential outcomes of this striking increase in harmful drinking among women and girls is a significant increase in the incidence of unplanned and unsafe sex, and resulting increase in HIV transmission. Not only does alcohol consumption play an important role in the transmission of HIV, but there is growing eidence that it may  play an important role in the  progression of HIV disease among women and girls, including the occurrence and course of comorbid conditions such as HCV, oral and esophageal candidiasis and TB, and adverse outcomes in the areas of sexual risk behavior, pregnancy and birth, adherence to medications and provider advice, provider and patient attitudes towards treatment, and survival. In response to mounting evidence of dramatic increases in harmful drinking among women, the Women, Drinking, and Pregnancy Work Group of the Interagency Coordinating Committee on Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (ICCFASD) proposes to convene a National Conference on Alcohol and Other Substance Use Among Women and Girls in October, 2017.

9430164,"The Center for Cancer Genomics (CCG) at the National Cancer Institute (NCI) was established in 2011 with a mission to lead the NCI efforts in generating critical datasets required to catalog the alterations seen in human tumors, coordinating data unification and sharing efforts, and supporting development of analytical tools and computational approaches aimed at improving our understanding of the large-scale, multidimensional data. CCG also has the goal of developing and applying cutting-edge genomic science to prevent cancer and better treat cancer patients, for example in the context of NCI-supported clinical trials. Currently, several large-scale cancer genome research projects fall under the CCG umbrella including those managed by The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) Program Office and the Office of Cancer Genomics (OCG).  The CCG is initiating a variety of new projects that require the genomic analysis of cancer specimens and cancer models (e.g. human cancer cell lines). Broadly, the goals of these initiatives include the elucidation of pathogenetic mechanisms in cancer and how genomic alterations in cancer influence the response to treatment. One such effort is the recently initiated Cancer Driver Discovery Program (CDDP), which aims to identify genes that acquire ?driver mutations? in 2% or more cases of cancers of a particular histology. The CDDP pilot has been launched with initial focus on three tumor types ? lung adenocarcinoma, colon carcinoma and ovarian carcinomas ? but will consider other tumor types as well. By sequencing biopsies in larger numbers than has occurred in the TCGA program (i.e. >500), the CDDP will have the statistical power to discover new recurrently mutated genes in cancer that may drive the oncogenic process. Another program supported by this Yellow Task would be the Clinical Trial Sequencing Project (CTSP), in which CCG is working with DCTD to conduct comprehensive genomic analysis of cancer biopsy specimens from patients enrolled on NCI-sponsored clinical trials, with the goal of identifying the molecular basis for therapeutic response and resistance. A third CCG initiative, termed the Human Cancer Models Program (HCMP), will include the genomic analysis of newly created human cancer models growing in vitro or in xenografts. This Yellow Task is not limited to support for genomic analyses within CDDP, CTSP and HCMP, but rather will enable CCG to conduct similar analyses in other cohorts of cancer specimens or models that address key questions in cancer pathogenesis and treatment.  This Yellow Task supports a range of activities necessary for the conduct of the genomic analyses outlined above. First, the contractor will support the acquisition of tissue samples and cancer models for CCG-sponsored projects. It is expected that accrual of tumors will mainly come from collections existing at the NCI Cooperative Groups or similar entities that have obtained the specimens in the context of large-scale well-annotated clinical trials. However, other sources of tissues are not precluded and are in scope for this task order. The accrual process for samples and associated clinical data will involve reimbursement of a modest amount to the participating institutions in a single payment structure.  Second, this Yellow Task supports the Biospecimen Core Repository (BCR), which provides CCG with support for the acquisition of cancer biopsy samples, the derivation of molecular analytes (DNA, RNA and protein), and the curation of clinical data associated with CCG-sponsored genomic studies. Additionally, the BCR will produce documents (Material Transfer Agreements, MTA) that codify the legal relationship between the Tissue Source Site(s) (TSS), the Genomic Characterization Center(s) (GCC) and the BCR.  Finally, this Yellow Task supports the establishment of Genomic Characterization Centers (GCCs), which will produce molecular data of various types from the analytes provided by the BCR and deposit said data in a format that is compatible with other large-scale genomics projects sponsored by CCG. Deposition of data will be done at a database to be designated by the Program Office (PO)."

9394007,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT. Telomerase is critical for health and longevity, but there is a fundamental lack of understanding of how it is regulated in human cells. This knowledge gap impedes the ability to develop therapies for a growing spectrum of disorders in which telomerase dysfunction is implicated. The long-term goal of this project is to be able to manipulate telomerase in human cells for therapeutic benefit, with a key target being the hematopoietic system. The level of the noncoding telomerase RNA component TERC is a critical determinant of telomerase function in cells. Low TERC levels resulting from genetic mutations cause a wide spectrum of degenerative disorders, including dyskeratosis congenita (DC), aplastic anemia, MDS/leukemia, solid tumors, pulmonary fibrosis, and cirrhosis. What is not known is how TERC levels are regulated in cells, which is an important barrier to developing therapeutic strategies to manipulate telomerase. The overall objective of this proposal is to understand how TERC is regulated in human stem cells including hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). The central hypothesis is that cis-acting elements at the TERC locus and other factors that function post-transcriptionally act in concert to determine the steady-state level of TERC in cells. The rationale for this work is that deciphering how patient mutations impact TERC biogenesis will yield a new understanding of how TERC levels are normally regulated, which will in turn reveal novel approaches to manipulate telomerase activity. The central hypothesis will be tested by pursuing two Specific Aims: (1) Identify transcriptional mechanisms regulating human TERC expression, and (2) Identify post-transcriptional mechanisms regulating human TERC levels. Under the first aim, ?scarless? genome-editing in induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells from DC patients will be used to define the function of newly identified cis-acting elements in the human TERC locus, and to reveal trans-acting factors that modulate TERC transcription. Tools and techniques that have been developed and demonstrated to be feasible in the applicants' hands will be used. Under the second aim, the role of an RNA processing factor recently found to be disrupted in DC patients who have low TERC levels will be investigated. Using patient iPS cells, which have been created by the applicant and carry mutations in this gene, the post-transcriptional processing and maturation of TERC will be investigated. The approach is innovative because the new tools and insights now available allow a critical shift in focus from the regulation of the catalytic component of telomerase (TERT), which has been the subject of intense investigation, to the equally important but less well studied RNA component of telomerase, TERC. The proposed research is significant, because it is expected to yield new strategies to manipulate telomerase activity in a growing number of hematopoietic and degenerative disorders including aplastic anemia, MDS/leukemia, pulmonary and cardiovascular disease, in which telomerase dysfunction is implicated but for which there are few if any curative therapies.

As a component of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), an agency of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), the NIAMS supports basic, translational, and clinical research; research training; and information programs on many of the more debilitating diseases affecting the American people. Most of these diseases are chronic and many cause life-long pain, disability, or disfigurement. They affect millions of Americans, cause tremendous human suffering, and cost the U.S. economy billions of dollars in health care costs and lost productivity. These diseases include the many different forms of arthritis and numerous disorders of the musculoskeletal system and the skin. The Institute also conducts and supports research on the normal structure and function of bones, joints, muscles, and skin. The NIAMS is committed to a comprehensive program of information dissemination. Research advances are of limited value if they never reach the arena of health care, therefore missing the goal of improving public health for all Americans. The NIC and the NRC help support the NIAMS effort of reaching patients, their health care providers, the research community, and the media with information about medical research advances, particulatly related to arthritis, musculoskeletal, and skin diseases. In addition, the NIAMS works closely with many voluntary and professional societies to learn their needs and disseminate NIAMS research findings to them. The NIAMS targets much of its information to certain high-need audiences, such as underrepresented and non-English-speaking communities, and it strives to make its information accessible to the vast and diverse populations affected by the diseases within its mandate. The NIAMS contracted with an organization to provide all management, technical, logistical, and administrative services for the continued operation of the NIC, a congressionally authorized national information clearinghouse. This contract included the operations of the NIC and the provision of related information dissemination services to the NIAMS OCPL. The nature of the support services included public inquiry response, materials development, materials management and dissemination, database development, meeting and exhibit support, and communications planning and outreach in support of the NIAMS' mission to disseminate information."

9434266,"Widely recognized as one of the primary pathological agents responsible for Alzheimer's disease (AD), ?-amyloid peptide triggers a broad host of cellular pathologies including synapse loss, tau phosphorylation, and ultimately cell death. One of the earliest manifestations of AD in the central nervous system is the loss of excitatory synapses and impaired function at remaining synapses, which precedes widespread neuronal cell death. Accumulating evidence suggests that synapse elimination and dysfunction is triggered by soluble oligomeric assemblies of the beta-amyloid peptide (A?o). Intriguingly, A?o-mediated synapse loss requires activation of NMDA-type glutamate receptors (NMDARs), which conduct Ca2+, a critical second messenger for diverse forms of synaptic plasticity required for normal cognitive function. How or whether A?o directly influences synaptic NMDAR function is unclear. We recently found that Ca2+ entry through synaptic NMDARs was potently impaired following exposure to concentrations of A?o similar to those found in the cerebrospinal fluid of healthy individuals. Here we propose to dissect the mechanisms and signaling pathways responsible for A?o-induced NMDA receptor impairment and explore the possibility that A?o could play a normal role in NMDA receptor regulation in the healthy brain. If true, this would be a completely new and important function for amyloid peptides and would yield new insights into how these proteins contribute to synaptic dysfunction when misregulated."

The Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Final Rule for Section 508 (EIT Accessibility) can be found at www.section508.gov and at the Access Board?s Web site at https://www.access-board.gov/508.htm.  Unless it is an ?undue burden? or compliant products or services do not exist, the products must conform to Section 508. The contractor should state that they will comply with the requirements of Section 508 or cite a justifiable reason for an exception.  NINDS may put contractor?s presentation on its public website.  Presentations (video and/or powerpoint ) must allow for individuals with disabilities to view them by following Section 508 accessibility standards from the United States Board 36 CFR Part 1194.  Section 508  requires that individuals with disabilities, who are members of the public seeking information or services from a Federal agency, have access to and use of information and data that is comparable to that provided to the public who are not individuals with disabilities, unless an undue burden would be imposed on the agency.  For example, presentations should not use color coding as the only means of conveying information, indicating an action, prompting a response, or distinguishing a visual element.  In addition, all training and informational video and multimedia productions which support the agency's mission, regardless of format, that contain speech or other audio information necessary for the comprehension of the content, shall be open or closed captioned.  Partially conforming presentations will be accepted from the contractor, since the COR will work with the contractor and the NINDS IT Web Team to make contractor?s presentation fully compliant with Section 508.

9574551,"Despite advances in its early detection and improved treatment options, breast cancer remains a significant health problem. Although breast cancer mortality is declining, preventing breast cancer or its progression is the most effective way of reducing breast cancer deaths. For women with estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancers, anti-estrogen drugs are effective for both treatment and prevention. For women with HER2-positive breast cancer, anti-HER2 targeted therapies have been found to be effective for the treatment and are now being tested for the prevention of HER2-positive breast cancers. However, for women whose tumors lack ER, progesterone receptor (PR), and HER2 (aka triple negative breast cancer, TNBC), there are few options for targeted therapy. TNBC, which accounts for 10-20% of invasive breast cancers, is known to be more aggressive with poor prognosis, and is resistant to anti-estrogen or anti-HER2 therapies. The p53-mutant TNBCs are typically high grade with poorer prognosis even if treated with chemotherapy. TNBC tumors also frequently harbor BRCA1 gene mutations, especially in women with a family history of breast cancer. Evidently, there is a clear need for the clinical development of new agents with novel mechanisms of action, documented/established efficacy and minimal toxicity for the prevention of ER negative and Triple negative breast cancers. Accumulating data suggest that mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) is a crucial mediator of tumor progression and may be a promising target in a significant proportion of breast cancer patients. Deregulation of mTOR has been found in TNBCs and a mutation of the BRCA1 gene increases the phosphorylation and kinase activity of AKT1 and mTOR signaling pathways.  Everolimus (mTOR inhibitor) is a second generation rapalog approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to be used in combination with other agents to treat advanced-stage, hormone-receptor-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer in postmenopausal women. Further, everolimus is used to treat ER-positive tumors that have become resistant to anti-estrogen therapy. This drug is now being tested in clinical trials for the treatment of ER-negative breast cancer. Such ?clinical-ready? agents, already in clinical use for treatment of cancer and other diseases, offer prevention options that may be primed for clinical translation within a much shorter timeframe, if favorable toxicity profiles can be established in the prevention setting. Alternative modes of administration of these clinical-ready agents - including lower, potentially less toxic doses, represent a viable approach to drug development for prevention of breast cancer.  The overarching goal of this task order is to evaluate an mTOR inhibitor, Everolimus, for its chemopreventive efficacy in preclinical models with loss of BRCA1 and P53,  and p53-mutant TNBC."

9545273,"Approximately 37 million people are living with HIV, with 15 million accessing antiretroviral therapy (ART). Recently revised WHO guidelines recommend that all people diagnosed with HIV be offered ART at any CD4 count, which will result in many more people on ART. Current ART regimens are very potent and reduce HIV viral load in blood to undetectable levels in most patients, which in turn significantly reduces mortality and morbidity and reduces transmission of HIV. However, viral rebound can occur through non-adherence or resistance. In either case, it is critical to identify viral rebound as early as possible in order to avoid drug resistance and clinical progression. The ability to easily monitor HIV plasma RNA in blood at home would help identify viral rebound early and allow intervention. Ideally, HIV RNA testing at home should be as easy as glucose monitoring for diabetics. If priced appropriately, this technology may be useful for home monitoring in resource limited settings where patients live far from the clinical care site. Such a technology could also be used for home monitoring of individuals enrolled in clinical trials involving a treatment interruption who need to have their viral load monitored very frequently, in-home monitoring for individuals using pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), where HIV infection must be detected very early to avoid resistance to the drugs in the PrEP regimen, and in-home monitoring for high risk individuals to allow early detection and early treatment, which may lead to smaller HIV reservoirs and reduced transmission."

9446099,"Project Summary ? Project 1 Peanut allergy is a common food allergy that is associated with fatal anaphylactic reaction. While allergy is an IgE mediated disease, accumulating evidence suggests that allergen specific CD4+ T cells play a significant role in disease development. The objective of this project is to establish peanut allergy as a heterogeneous disease with peanut epitope specific T cells as a biomarker to define disease heterogeneity. The specific aims of this project will include: 1) Identifying peanut specific CD4+ T cell epitope; 2) Examining the phenotype of peanut epitope specific T helper cells; 3) Testing the hypothesis that the phenotype of peanut specific T cells depends on the epitope they recognized; 4) Evaluating phenotype heterogeneity of peanut specific T helper cells in peanut allergic subjects; 5) Testing the hypothesis that phenotype of peanut specific T cells can be used to segregate peanut allergic subjects into 2 distinct subtypes; 5) Establishing a link between phenotype and molecular signature of peanut specific T cells and allergic disease status; 6) Examining the epitope specificity peanut specific regulatory T cells and 7) Testing the hypothesis that regulatory T cells in allergic subjects are functionally impaired. We will use class II tetramers in tracking peanut specific cell and cutting edge technologies, including CyTOF and single cell RNA-seq, in examining peanut specific T cells. A CD154/CD137 assay will also be developed to monitor both peanut specific T effectors and regulatory T cells. The cumulative results will lead to a much better understanding of peanut specific T cells in the pathogenesis of peanut allergy."

9438756,"PROJECT SUMMARY The purpose of this proposal is to provide opportunities for undergraduate students from under- represented or disadvantaged backgrounds to engage in an intensive, summer research training experience. Individuals from diverse backgrounds are under-represented in biomedical and behavioral sciences. While the underpinnings of this issue are complex, the problem has been perpetuated in no small part due to major limitations in the ?pipeline? of trainees from diverse backgrounds. As a reflection of our commitment to this issue, the Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine has been running an NHLBI-funded program for students from under-represented or disadvantaged backgrounds for the past 15 years. We wish to build on this foundation, and sustain this initiative. Our program was developed on the premise that the principal barrier to diversity in science is not a lack of talent, but rather a lack of opportunity. The program was built around an intensive research experience with an individual mentor, complemented by activities important to building communication and networking skills, such as making presentations in journal club and at a closing poster session, as well as seminars that describe issues relevant to career-building in biomedical sciences. To date we have trained 212 students in our program. Of the 186 students that participated in our program and have now graduated from their undergraduate institution, 163 have been accepted to, enrolled in or received advanced degrees from medical/graduate school. In addition, 8 students are working full-time in research positions with plans to apply to graduate/medical school, bringing the number of past participants actively engaged in the biomedical sciences to 91%. In pursuing funding through this R25 program, we have three principal goals. The first is to provide a high quality scientific experience to students of diverse backgrounds as a means of exposing them to, and persuading them of, the excitement of careers in biomedical sciences. The second goal is to provide students exposure to activities that will enhance their chances for success in biomedical careers, such as organizing material for presentations and seminars on the mentee- mentor relationship. Finally, we hope to continue to develop a network of contacts and information that will help these individuals surmount historical issues of access that have limited entry and success. Over the past 15 years, we have demonstrated our commitment to enhancing diversity in the biomedical sciences, and we look forward to extending this commitment."

9564741,"Gastric cancer (GC) is the 4th most common incident cancer and the 2nd leading cause of cancer death worldwide.1 Approximately 990,000 people are diagnosed with GC worldwide, of whom close to 75% die from this disease.2 GC also is responsible for one of the highest cancer burdens, as determined by disability-adjusted life years lost.3 Despite the overall decrease in the incidence of GC since the 1930s, the annual global burden of cancer is projected to double by 2030 to 22.2 million incident cases and 13.1 million deaths, with over two-thirds of the burden in resource-limited nations.4, 5 In the US, the American Cancer Society estimates that in 2015 24,590 new cases of GC will be diagnosed and approximately 10,720 individuals will die from this type of cancer.6 The average risk that a person will develop GC in his/her lifetime is about 1 in 111, with the risk being 2 to 3-fold higher in men than women. However, GC incidence rates vary dramatically across different countries and are higher in less developed countries.2 GC is more common in East Asia, Southern and Eastern Europe, and South and Central America whereas the lowest incidence rates are observed in Africa and North America.7 Although nearly 60% of the new GC cases are diagnosed in Asia,8 significantly better outcomes have been reported among Asian individuals compared to those diagnosed in Western countries.9 Five-year GC survival rates are 40% lower in the US and Europe compared to Japan.10   With the high GC mortality-to-incidence ratio and the lack of routine screening methods available for asymptomatic individuals, the management of GC remains a challenge and warrants further investigations to more fully understand the biologic basis of progression and to develop chemopreventive strategies for individuals at increased risk.  Curcumin is a phenolic antioxidant compound derived from the rhizome of the plant Curcuma longa. This bioflavonoid is a potent inhibitor of arachidonic acid metabolism, and blocks both lipoxygenase and cyclooxygenase activity in the intestinal mucosa. Curcumin exerts a variety of additional immunomodulatory and antioxidant effects and is thought to have broad chemopreventive potential through a variety of molecular mechanisms and cellular pathways, as recently reviewed.11  The investigators (Drs. Cruz-Correa & Morgan) from the Mayo Consortium are proposing a chemopreventive trial on a population at risk for gastric cancer (GC) using Meriva (a liposome-encapsulated formulation of curcumin) and placebo. The hypothesis is that curcumin given to individuals with gastric precancerous lesions ? multifocal atrophic gastritis (MAG) & intestinal metaplasia (IM) will have a decrease in markers of inflammation including DNA damage, as compared to placebo, after six months of taking the study agent.  Meriva (Curcumin) is a patented formula of curcumin that includes a dietary phenolic with soy lecithin (non-GMO). The curcumin content and the curcuminoid absorption is 27 fold higher when compared to curcumin alone."

9569843,"The EAGeR trial was a multi-center, block-randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted across four medical centers in the U.S. A total of 1228 women ages 18-40 years with up to two documented prior miscarriages and who planned to become pregnant again were randomized for this trial, making the EAGeR trial the largest preconception trial of LDA. Each woman was randomly assigned to 81 mg aspirin daily or placebo beginning prior to conception and continued to 36 weeks gestation in women achieving pregnancy. Participants were block randomized by study center and eligibility stratum, defined based on specific eligibility qualifications: 1) original stratum, women with exactly one documented pregnancy loss <20 weeks gestation during the preceding 12 months; and 2) expanded stratum, women not meeting all criteria for the original stratum, and having 1 or 2 prior pregnancy losses of any gestational age at any time in the past. Participants attended two study visits per menstrual cycle for the first two cycles attempting pregnancy and once per cycle thereafter, which included spot urine and blood sample collection. Follow-up ended after six menstrual cycles attempting pregnancy or, in women becoming pregnant, throughout pregnancy.  This proposal is to request funding for the measurement of stored biospecimens in the EAGeR Trial.  The assays proposed will provide a rich data source on biomarker levels that can be analyzed to answer novel research questions in conjunction with the extensive data already collected in the EAGeR Trial.  A growing body of evidence suggests that exposure to many common environmental chemicals, particularly those with endocrine-disrupting properties, may be associated with impaired fecundability and increased risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes.  The objective of this task is to measure several analytes in stored serum and urine samples from the EAGeR trial to investigate the association between environmental chemicals and ovulation, fecundability, pregnancy, and pregnancy loss.  Ship approximately 10,012 specimens to the UMN lab.  Receive and re-stock into the EAGeR inventory approximately 8812 residual specimens after analysis is completed."
9587931,"NIH DRUG DISCOVERY AND DEVELOPMENT CONSULTING SERVICES  STATEMENT OF WORK  A.  BACKGROUND  The National Institutes of Health (NIH) is the nation?s leading medical research agency and the primary Federal agency whose mission is to seek fundamental knowledge about the nature and behavior of living systems and the application of that knowledge to enhance health, lengthen life, and reduce illness and disability, conducting, supporting and making medical discoveries that improve people?s health and save lives.    The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) is a part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), conducting research into the causes, treatment, and prevention of neurological disorders and stroke. The NINDS mission is to seek fundamental knowledge about the brain and nervous system and to use that knowledge to reduce the burden of neurological disease.  The NIH Blueprint for Neuroscience Research, a consortium of 8 NIH Institutes and Centers that support neuroscience research, established the Blueprint Neurotherapeutics Network (BPN) as a pipeline between the typical endpoint of NIH-funded research and the beginning of industry drug development. The BPN provides neuroscience researchers with funding and access to a full range of industry-style drug development services and expertise. The program is intended for projects requiring medicinal chemistry optimization and contract research organization (CRO) support through phase I clinical testing. Each project is directed by a Lead Development Team (LDT) composed of the principal investigator (PI), industry consultants hired by NIH, and NIH staff. This team maps out a research strategy, including milestones, and oversees implementation by CROs. Bioactivity and efficacy studies are funded through an award to the PI; other research services are provided without cost to the PI through NIH contracts.  The BPN currently has projects in the exploratory through preclinical safety stages. Some projects will proceed to the Investigational New Drug (IND) and clinical trial stages.

9392924,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Myocardial ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury is a major human health problem causing millions of deaths per year. Myocardial I/R involves severe cardiac myocyte dysfunction and myocyte death for which there is no cure. It has been challenging to dissect the role of specific mechanistic pathways in I/R owing to the multitude of cellular processes altered in I/R, including elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS), membrane instability, intracellular Ca2+ mishandling, mitochondrial uncoupling and others. Despite these challenges, myocyte generated ROS is widely considered a key initiating event leading to cellular damage in cardiac I/R. We provide exciting new evidence of a significant uncoupling of myocyte-generated ROS and damage in cardiac I/R. Thus, this proposal focuses on a new paradigm in testing the hypothesis that sarcolemma stability, independent of increased ROS production, is central to I/R injury. To interrogate I/R mechanisms we will implement sarcolemma stabilizers that in preliminary work significantly limit myocyte leak, Ca2+ mishandling, mitochondrial membrane depolarization and preserve myocyte viability despite I/R-mediated increased ROS. These results challenge the dogma of the mechanism of I/R damage by highlighting sarcolemma stabilization as central in the I/R injury pathway. Sarcolemma stabilization by cell surface interacting synthetic copolymers is proposed here as a tool for mechanistic dissection of the direct role of cardiac muscle membrane integrity in I/R. Copolymer-based membrane stabilizers are amphiphilic long-chain macromolecular copolymers that interact with and protect cellular membranes during stress. The overarching hypothesis of this proposal is that, independent of I/R-mediated ROS production, synthetic sarcolemma stabilizers function to significantly limit myocyte Ca2+ dysregulation and mitochondrial depolarization to increase heart pump performance in vivo. Stated differently, we will test the hypothesis that ROS alone is insufficient to cause I/R injury. This hypothesis, if correct, will change the field by providing direct evidence in establishing membrane integrity as central in I/R pathogenesis. The impact of this work derives from using synthetic sarcolemma stabilizers as a viable new therapeutic option that could be readily translated to clinical settings of I/R. The Specific Aims are: Aim 1. To test the hypothesis that during I/R, independent of myocyte ROS production, copolymer sarcolemma stabilizers will significantly limit membrane leak, intracellular Ca2+ mishandling and mitochondrial membrane depolarization to promote cell viability in rodent adult myocytes and human iPSC-derived cardiac myocytes in vitro. Aim 2. To test the hypothesis that copolymer sarcolemma stabilization will promote myocyte viability and preserve myocardial function in a clinically relevant porcine model of myocardial I/R injury in vivo."

9470481,"The urinary tract, especially the bladder, is one of the most common sites of bacterial infection in humans. Uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC) is the predominant cause of urinary tract infection (UTI). Women, children, the elderly, and individuals with catheters, uroliths, or diabetes mellitus are highly susceptible to UTI. There is an immediate need for novel strategies to manage UTI because of an alarming increase in antibiotic resistance in UPEC globally. We have demonstrated that copper (Cu) is mobilized to urine as a host response during clinical UTI in patients. We have developed a non-human primate model of UTI that recapitulates urinary Cu mobilization observed in human UTI. Our findings, taken together with reports of fulminant UTI in patients with Menkes disease (who cannot absorb dietary Cu), highlight an important and novel biological role for Cu in the protection against UTI. Our long-term research goal is to define the molecular and cellular features of host-pathogen interaction during UTI to identify targets for therapeutic development. Major objectives of this proposal are to define the mechanism of Cu-mediated protection against UPEC colonization, and to determine how Cu is mobilized to urine during UTI. Based on our published and preliminary data, we hypothesize that Cu is mobilized to urine in response to UPEC signals to impede bacterial survival, and that augmenting the toxicity of Cu will promote UPEC clearance. The rationale for the proposed work is that understanding Cu mobilization, and its impact on UPEC survival are critical to develop therapeutics that bolster this innate response to resolve UTI. We will test our central hypothesis by pursuing the following specific aims: 1) Determine how copper deters UPEC survival, and identify pathogen signals that trigger copper mobilization; 2) Define the mechanism of copper-mediated UPEC killing within human phagocytes; and 3) Determine the effect of augmenting the toxicity of copper on UPEC clearance. The expected outcomes of this study include understanding the direct and indirect impact of Cu on UPEC clearance during UTI, and the identification of the pathogen signals that trigger Cu mobilization. We will determine the mechanism of Cu-mediated UPEC killing in human phagocytes. Cu-boosting treatments are anticipated to promote UPEC clearance in the mouse and non-human primate models of UTI. The substantial positive impact of this study will be elucidating the role of an innate host defense effector in protection against UTI in humans. The proposed research is significant because our findings are anticipated to break new ground to develop novel interventions against UTI. Our approach is innovative because we seek to bolster a host effector that is amenable to dietary and pharmacological modulation, to promote resolution of UTI. In summary, the proposed study is expected to confer a significant public health benefit against UTI, a ubiquitous and profoundly painful infectious disease affecting millions of people."

The Center for Population Research (CPR), within NICHD, was established in 1968 by the Secretary of Health Education and Welfare, with the important goal of developing new contraceptives through the use of contracts and grants. Within CPR, the Contraception and Reproductive Health Branch (CRHB) has long supported several preclinical contraceptive testing facilities as well as facilities for synthetic chemical and synthetic peptide formulation.  To further expand their contraceptive development capabilities, in 1996 CRHB established the NICHD Contraceptive Clinical Trials Network (CCTN). The current CCTN has conducted Phase I, II, and III clinical trials of contraceptive methods.  With the recompetition of the CCTN, clinical sites will perform Phase I, II, III, and Phase IV clinical trials of a wide variety of new or existing female contraceptive methods. There is a demand for estrogen-free contraception in order to reduce the risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE), particularly for obese women.

9573288,"There is a demand for estrogen-free contraception in order to reduce the risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE), particularly for obese women. A new oral contraceptive agent consisting of a progesterone receptor modulator, which does not affect endogenous estrogen levels, has been developed. Ulipristal acetate (UPA) has been used in a single high dose for emergency contraception and has been used continuously for up to six months for treatment of uterine fibroids. Low dose continuous usage of oral UPA is anticipated to inhibit ovulation and provide an estrogen free, bleed free method of contraception.   The Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institutes of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) has a mission to develop safe and effective contraceptives for women, including obese women. Obesity is the number one public health issue facing the US population and is an independent risk for venous thromboembolism (VTE). Therefore, there is a public health need to develop effective contraception for woman that does not increase the risk of VTE. One Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved contraceptive method is the progestin-only pill (POP). This method requires strict adherence to taking the POP at the same time every day. The method is associated with irregular bleeding which often leads to discontinuation of the method. Daily low dose oral progesterone receptor modulators (PRMs), such as UPA, have been shown to inhibit ovulation and cause amenorrhea. The endogenous estrogen level is not affected by the PRM. Thus, the method will provide a regimen that is easier to follow than POP regimen and have a theoretically lower risk of VTE, especially for obese women. In addition, there is in vitro evidence that UPA may have protective activity against breast cancer. In order to provide preliminary evidence that daily, low dose UPA could be effective for contraception, a clinical trial will be conducted in the NICHD Contraceptive Clinical Trials Network (CCTN). The proposed study will be evaluated sequentially. Initially, women of reproductive age, with normal menstrual cycles, will receive treatment for 12 weeks (three 28-day cycles) in order to evaluate the mechanisms of contraceptive efficacy, safety and acceptability of this new contraceptive."
9574500,"Over the past two decades, clinical trials have become increasingly dependent upon image-based surrogate endpoints for evaluation of cancer therapeutics. The growing complexity of image-based response evaluation criteria has made it challenging for radiologists to provide reliable, timely, protocol-compliant longitudinal measurements. The Tumor Imaging Metrics Core of the Dana-Farber/Harvard Cancer Center has increased the quality and efficiency of imaging assessments by developing a software system, branded Precision Imaging Metrics (PIM), which is currently in use at six NCI-designated Cancer Centers. The PIM system consists of two applications: a web-based workflow informatics management application and a desktop imaging application. This proposal aims to extend the PIM solution into an entirely cloud-based, widely deployable and easily supportable system with an integrated web-based image review tool. The proposed contract has two aims: to assess the feasibility of a cloud-hosted, zero-footprint system for workflow management and image review, and to develop systematic processes and documentation to simplify onboarding, performance qualification, and customer support of nationwide Cancer Centers.

9466334,"Project Summary / Abstract  The proposed research focuses on the development of a turn-key resonator for liquid-state Overhauser Dynamic Nuclear Polarization (ODNP) spectroscopy to study the site-specific translational dynamics of water molecules located at the interface of bio-macromolecules such as membrane proteins. It will allow researchers to readily perform ODNP experiments in a state-of-the-art commercially available X-band cw/pulsed electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectrometer.  In recent years, DNP has proven to be a robust method to increase signal intensities in NMR experiments in laboratories around the world and substantial progress has been made in adapting DNP for solid- and solution- state NMR spectroscopy. This progress has sparked a new interest in ODNP spectroscopy. Although the method is known since the 1960s it has just recently been applied successfully to study the site-specific translational dynamics of water located at the interface of large bio-macromolecules such as membrane proteins. ODNP can map out the local and site-specific hydration dynamics landscape of membrane proteins and lipid membranes and can provide critical information about the protein structure and dynamics.  One of the major challenges in ODNP spectroscopy is microwave induced sample heating. In this SBIR Phase I application we propose to develop a turn-key, ODNP resonator compatible with state-of-the-art continuous wave or pulsed X-Band EPR spectrometer, which can be found in many academic spectroscopy facilities. The resonator will have a much higher microwave conversion factor compared to conventional rectangular or circular EPR cavities. In addition, the low Q resonance structure will allow pulsed ODNP experiments to further minimize microwave induced heating by reducing the average power required to saturate the EPR transitions.  The successful development of this technology will provide researchers access to instrumentation allowing them to incorporate ODNP spectroscopy in their research routine without the hassle of troubleshooting home-built equipment. This will greatly proliferate the method and is of large interest to many projects funded by the U.S. National Institutes of Health."

9430184,"Human Papillomavirus infection is mostly benign and self-limiting, however certain genotypes are considered high risk and oncogenic. HPV has been found in virtually all cervical cancers with HPV 16 causing 50% and HPV 18 another 20%. Currently, there are three licensed human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines with excellent efficacy, but poorly characterized correlates of vaccine induced immunity. One of the vacines is bivalent (Cervarix, GSK), the second is quadrivalent (Gardasil, Merck), while the third is nonavalent (Gardasil9). All three vaccines utilize virus like particles (VLPs) based on the L1 major capsid protein from HPV. VLPs are noninfectious protein capsids which can be produced by expressing the capsid protein in yeast or insect cells. The recombinant L1 capsid protein assembles in into the 60-nm HPV VLP. The efficacy of each vaccine has been evaluated with different standards, making comparison of the vaccines difficult. There has also been indication suggesting that one dose of these vaccines may be as efficacious as the three dose regimen currently in use, however there is no set of serological standards that could be used for evaluation. Currently, pooled human serum serves as the best standard and is used to create a curve from which results are extrapolated in arbitrary Units/ml. However, the pooled serum is a finite resource and subsequent studies require the development of a new pool that is calibrated against the previous pool and therefore has its limitations as a standard. The goal is to establish a laboratory that would standardize and harmonize serological assays for Human Papillomavirus (HPV) antibody testing through development of validated reagents and standards that will be available to the scientific community.

9388364,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A central goal of sensory neuroscience is to understand the neural code in sensory cortical areas to the point where, by monitoring neural responses in a subject engaged in a perceptual task, one could read, in real time, the content of the neural representation and account for the subject's perceptual capabilities. The overarching goal of the proposed research is to understand the nature of the neural code in primate V1. Specifically, we will focus on the neural code in two important perceptual tasks, pattern discrimination and contour grouping. In Aim 1 we will test the hypothesis that, in addition to representing stimuli by the activity of a small subset of highly selective neurons, V1 representation relies on the large-scale pattern of spatial variations in neural population responses across the retinotopic map. Specifically, we recently discovered a novel topographic signal in V1, reflecting the spatial representation of the stimulus's luminance modulations (LM) in V1's retinotopic map. We also documented a similar retinotopic signal reflecting the global pattern of the stimulus' contrast modulations (CM). By monitoring neural responses at the retinotopic and columnar scales as monkeys perform a threshold orientation discrimination task, we will test the hypothesis that the retinotopic LM and CM signals contribute to visual perception. In Aim 2 we will examine the contribution of primate V1 to perceptual grouping - the process of grouping together disparate visual elements that belong to the same object. Specifically, we will test the hypothesis that mechanisms involving configuration-specific lateral interactions in V1 play a key role in this process, and initiate the grouping by linking together pairs of elements that are likely to belong to the same object. To test this hypothesis, we will monitor neural population responses in V1 of monkeys as they perform a challenging and naturalistic perceptual grouping task. In addition, these experiments will be used to determine the rules by which responses to local image elements combine to form a spatiotemporal pattern of population activity in primate V1. Overall, the proposed experiments are likely to provide important and unique insights into the neural mechanisms that mediate cortical sensory processing."

9430183,"One of the challenges in cancer research is that a single measured parameter fails to provide a complete picture. As a result, there has been expanded use of multi-parameter or high-content technologies which have applications across a broad spectrum of cancer research areas. CSSI has promoted the development of these high-content technologies and to facilitate the broader use and adoption of these tools proposes to develop a 'High-content Integrative Pathology Core' at the Fredrick National Laboratory for Cancer Research. The lab would include capabilities to characterize and compare both single cells and bulk tissue. Characterization would be focused on cell and tissue morphology, genomics, and proteomics characterization. Assays would allow for characterization and comparisons of rare cells from blood, bone marrow, and tissue biopsies. Potential applications are broad and would include investigating metastatic processes, understanding of the microenvironment, and investigating the immune system and immunotherapies."

9360003,"Repetitive mild closed head injury (rCHI) is a common form of mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) among military personnel in both combat and non-combat missions. rCHI can result in sustained cognitive decline and neurobehavioral changes (such as anxiety and depression-like behaviors) [1]. More recently rCHI has also been linked to the formation of a neurodegenerative condition called chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). CTE is pathologically characterized by protein aggregate deposit found in the cortex and other brain regions, post-mortem. Two major proteins found in these CTE protein deposits are microtubule-associated protein Tau and TAR DNA-binding protein (TDP-43) [2-5]. Patients with CTE may show symptoms of dementia, such as memory loss, confusion, anxiety, depression and aggression, which generally appear years or decade(s) after the occurrence of neurotrauma. The Central Hypothesis to be tested is that chronic cognitive and neurobehavioral changes following repetitive mTBI (rCHI) is closely linked to post-injury Tau and TDP-43 proteinopathy development. In addition, the proposed work will not only allow us to test this hypothesis, but also enable us to validate novel CTE biomarkers tests as well as to examine a novel Tau, TDP-43 proteinopathy-based immunotherapy strategy towards improvement of chronic neurobehavioral deficits. Three specific aims are proposed in this application to address the central hypothesis. In Specific Aim 1, we will subject wildtype mice to repetitive close head injury (rCHI) and follow them from subacute to chronic period (up to 18 mo.) to characterize cognitive and neurobehavioral changes, overall neuropathology and their correlation with time-dependent CTE-like Tau/P-tau and TDP-43 protein accumulation /proteinopathy signatures in brain tissue and biofluid. In Specific Aim 2 we will subject human-tau (hTau) transgenic mice and TDP-43 overexpressing transgenic mice to rCHI and follow them from subacute to chronic period to examine if they develop worsened cognitive and neurobehavioral changes, neuropathology and accelerated, exaggerated Tau/TDP-43 proteinopathy signatures in brain tissue and biofluid. Lastly, in Specific Aim 3, we will combine our learning from rCHI models in Aim 1 & 2 to test potential effects of Tau/P-Tau and TDP-43 immunization as novel immunotherapy for reducing rCHI-induced Tau and TDP-43 proteinopathy load and mitigating chronic cognitive, neurobehavioral and neuropathological changes in wildtype, hTau, TDP-43 transgenic and/or hTau/TDP-43 double transgenic mouse lines. This proposed systemic study will advance our understanding of the neurobehavioral (anxiety, depression, cognitive dysfunctions) and their potential linkage to the biochemical/protein changes of aggregation-prone proteins such as Tau and TDP-43 (proteinopathy) and CTE- like neurodegenerative cascade during the chronic phase of TBI. Such knowledge can translate into the ability for VA to devise better management tools and improved Veteran patient care. Our findings will also help us better diagnose chronic TBI including ultrasensitive biofluid-based Tau/P-tau and TDP-43-biomarker tests. Furthermore our research also points to a novel and promising immunotherapeutic strategy to treat such conditions. Taken together, these are all significant biomedical advances consistent with the research mission of the NF/SG VHS and VA and meet the full intent of the RFA. Importantly, the learning from this rodent studies and the immunotherapy approach can rapidly translate into clinical studies with Veterans who are at risk of developing post-TBI CTE. "
9577083,"Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide, with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) representing 80%. Despite advances in chemotherapy, the prognosis remains poor, as less than 20% of patients with stage IV disease have even a two-year survival rate. Hence, there is an urgent need for new or repurposed agents that are effective against this disease.  Oral bexarotene is used clinically to treat cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, and has shown modest efficacy in clinical trials of NSCLC. Despite its modest efficacy, oral bexarotene causes hypertriglyceridemia and hypercholesterolemia, which limit dose escalation to higher, perhaps more effective doses. We anticipate that aerosol delivery of bexarotene would result in little or no drug being delivered to the blood, thereby reducing/eliminating these systemic adverse effects, while maintaining or increasing its efficacious effects at the target site, the lung. The purpose of this task order is to support the aerosol development of bexarotene."

9565462,"The goal of this contract is to synthesize a heparan sulfate (HS) library consisting of structurally homogeneous oligosaccharides, in response to an SBIR contract call from NCl-321 Chemically Defined Glycan Libraries. The Contractor specializes in the synthesis of structurally diverse HS oligosaccharides. The Contractor has built an innovative chemoenzymatic method for Glycan synthesis. Polymeric HS contains the disaccharide repeating units of glucuronic or iduronic acid linked to glucosamine that carry sulfo groups. Chemical synthesis of structurally homogeneous HS oligosaccharides is extremely difficult. The chemoenzymatic method reduces synthetic complexity, providing a cost-effective approach to prepare a diverse collection of HS oligosaccharides. A library of 77 oligosaccharides with different sizes and sulfation patterns shall be constructed using this method. The library represents the basic structural elements found in naturally occurring HS. Synthesis shall be carried out under good laboratory practice (GLP) at a scale of 3 mg for each compound, which amount is sufficient for structural analysis by NMR and mass spectrometry as well as the purity analysis by anion-exchange high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Four milestones for sample preparations and deliveries are clearly marked.Heparan sulfate (HS) is a member of glycosaminoglycan family that is present in large quantities on the cell surface and in the extracellular matrix. HS is a highly sulfated polysaccharide with a disaccharide repeating unit of glucuronic acid (GLcA) or iduronic acid (ldoA) linked to glucosamine. Both ldoA and glucosamine residues carry sulfo groups. HS participates in numerous biological processes, including embryonic development, assisting viral and bacterial infections and regulating blood coagulation. The sulfation patterns and the location of ldoA residues, as well as the size of HS molecules play critical roles in determining the functions HS. Unfortunately, knowledge of HS is far less developed than knowledge of proteins and nucleic acids. One grand challenge in HS studies is to make HS oligosaccharides widely available to the scientific research community. Chemical synthesis of HS has been taken to respond to this challenge. However, the facts that complicated synthesis and low yield of products led to the unsuitableness for oligosaccharide library construction and for HS market. The objective of this contract is to employ a state-of-the-art chemoenzymatic approach to synthesize HS oligosaccharides with different structures under GLP conditions. A total of 77 oligosaccharides in the library have been selected based on the natural structures of HS and shall be synthesized. The oligosaccharides cover the range of tetra- to nona-saccharides.consisting of N-, 6-0-, 3-0-, and 2-0-, sulfation as well as ldoA residues. None of these compounds in the library is currently commercially available. Each compound has an aldehyde moiety at its reducing end and has a unique chromophoric group for easy detection. The purity of each compound is more than 98%. The structures of the newly synthesized compounds shall be proven by NMR and Mass spectrometry analyses. All 77 oligosaccharides at 50 ug of each compounds along with their NMR spectra shall be delivered to NIH by the end of Phase II. The targeted oligosaccharides can be divided into six groups, structurally differing in the size, sulfation patterns and with or without ldoA residues. Each compound has a pAHP (para-azido hexanamido) phenyl) capped GlcA end, which exhibits similar chemical reactivity to that of the reducing end of a given sugar residue .."

9567654,"Multiple agents are in development to prevent breast cancer. Selective estrogen modulators (SERMs, specifically tamoxifen and raloxifene) and third-generation aromatase inhibitors are either FDA-approved and/or have been demonstrated in phase 3 trials to reduce breast cancer incidence significantly.  The efficacy of these estrogen antagonizing agents is limited to prevention of ER+ breast cancers, however.  Although other, more broadly applicable (ER+, ER-, triple negative) breast cancer prevention agents are currently being tested, these agents remain at early stages of development, with no immediate translational applicability to the clinic. Yet, a need exists for a broader spectrum of effective breast cancer prevention agents, with documented/established efficacy and minimal toxicity. Such ?clinical-ready? agents, already in clinical use for treatment of cancer and other diseases, offer prevention options that are poised for translation within a much shorter timeframe. Alternative modes of administration of these clinical-ready agents - including lower, potentially less toxic, doses, and combinations to enhance efficacy ? represent a viable approach to drug development for prevention.  Two such agents are bazedoxifene and lapatinib. Bazedoxifene, a third-generation SERM, is approved in Europe for prevention and treatment of osteoporosis.  In Europe and the United States, it is approved in combination with conjugated equine estrogens (CEE), as Duavee, for treatment of osteoporosis and vasomotor symptoms associated with menopause. As expected of a SERM, bazedoxifene inhibits growth of hormone-dependent (ER+) breast cancer cells, down-regulating the ER alpha protein, but without stimulating the uterine endometrium.  In addition, bazedoxifene inhibits hormone-independent breast cancer cell growth and exhibits additional mechanistic activities such as down-regulation of cyclin D1 and inhibition of IL-6/GP130 protein-protein interactions resulting in induction of apoptosis and reduction of tumor growth.  Such observations, together with a low toxicity profile, support the testing of bazedoxifene specifically for prevention of breast cancer. Lapatinib, a small molecule dual receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor (RTKI) of both the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR/HER1) and human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2), is FDA-approved and is commonly used to treat patients with HER2-positive (HER2+) breast cancer. Lapatinib has been shown to inhibit development of ER+ tumors that develop in the Sprague-Dawley rat treated with the carcinogen methynitrosourea (MNU).  Additionally, lapatinib suppresses abundance of HER2, phosphorylated HER2, and phosphorylated EGFR in this rat model and modulates a number of downstream signaling molecules associated with proliferation, apoptosis and cell-cycle arrest. Although lapatinib has specific toxicities, primarily diarrhea and rash, the drug is generally well tolerated at dose levels used in treatment of metastatic cancer. Early studies of the clinical efficacy of lapatinib as a breast cancer prevention agent are ongoing. Both bazedoxifene and lapatinib are approved for human use with minimal toxicity at the approved treatment doses. For this reason, they are poised to be rapidly incorporated into a cancer prevention trial once preclinical studies support such translation. These drugs work through different mechanisms and thus may complement each other?s activity resulting in synergistic or additive effects. The hypothesis emerging from these observations is that combination treatment with the two agents should enable the use of lower, presumably less toxic, doses and simultaneously lead to enhanced efficacy in inhibition of breast carcinogenesis. The overall objective of this task order is to test the efficacy of two FDA-approved drugs, Bazedoxifene and Lapatinib, at lower doses, alone and in combination, for prevention of breast cancers in rodent models of ER+ and ER- breast cancer."
9554729,"The proposed clinical trial shall address the utility of inhaled iloprost for the prevention of lung cancer. Iloprost is a promising agent for the chemoprevention of lung cancer - a prior clinical trial showed reversion of bronchial dysplasia (a lung cancer precursor lesion) with oral iloprost. Since oral iloprost is no longer available, the goal of the current study is to determine if two different schedules of inhaled iloprost are tolerable and whether they modulate biomarkers of lung carcinogenesis.    The trial is a phase I trial of two different dose levels of iloprost, 5 micrograms (ucg) four times daily (QID) or twice daily (BID) given for 2 months to former smokers at the University of Colorado, Denver (Denver VA Medical Center). In each of the two dose levels, participants will be randomized to iloprost or matched placebo and will undergo pre- and post-treatment bronchoscopies with biopsies so that tissue-based biomarkers can be examined"
9454665,"Iodine is an essential nutrient required for the production of thyroid hormones. Consequences of severe iodine deficiency include goiter, hypothyroidism, cretinism, intellectual impairment and increased pregnancy loss, due to inadequate production of thyroid hormones. The recommended daily iodine intake is 150 ug/day in the general adult population, and 250 ug/day among pregnant and lactating women. Pregnancy increases iodine requirements in the mother by increasing maternal thyroid hormone requirements and renal iodine excretion, and because the fetal thyroid gland requires iodine from the mother. Recent studies of pregnant women in the United States show a decline in median urinary iodine concentrations from 327 ug/L in 1971-1974 to 129 ug/L in 2005-2010, indicating that more than half of all pregnant women in the United States are iodine deficient. The etiology of congenital hypothyroidism in areas where pregnant women suffer from severe iodine deficiency is well known. Because the fetus is totally dependent on maternal iodine for thyroid hormone production, it is virtually a given that a newborn with inadequate iodine status and congenital hypothyroidism has the condition because of low maternal iodine concentration. It is not known, however, whether the level of iodine deficiency present in US pregnant women Is sufficiently severe to cause congenital hypothyroidism. Measuring iodine concentrations in blood samples from newborns that have congenital hypothyroidism and from unaffected control newborns will provide us with a better sense of whether current maternal iodine concentrations in the US are affecting the fetus."

9483436,"Major birth defects are a serious health problem, occurring in approximately two percent of births.  Despite all the research that has been conducted, the cause of most birth defects remains unknown. Large scale genetic investigations offer a new pathway for etiologic investigation. As the technology advances, it becomes possible to do more and more with small samples of DNA. Our group has been active in identifying ways to use very small amounts of DNA (such as is available from filter paper blood spots) to conduct genome-wide studies. This study will examine the entire coding sequence of the genome (the exome) by whole exome sequencing (WES). The exome is an excellent target for genome studies because WES requires sequencing only 1-2% of the genome but provides data on all the coding material. Whole genome sequencing to obtain data on other potentially important areas is far more costly and creates serious challenges in interpreting the data. Therefore, WES is generally considered the best value. The data generated by this process can also be used to identify copy number variants (CNV). Thus, both variants as small as a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) change in an exome or as large as a duplication or deletion in a section of a chromosome, will be identified."

There are very few contraceptive options available to men. Studies indicate that men would use a  safe and reversible method of contraception if one were available to them. One promising  regimen involves a method of delivering androgen plus progestin in order to suppress sperm  production. Previous studies demonstrated the gonadotropin and sperm suppressing capability of  Nestorone gel and testosterone gel preparations applied transdermally. For the present study,  both steroids have been combined into a single gel formulation. This Task Order is for the  conduct of a Phase lb clinical trial to test whether the combined Nestorone and Testosterone gel , as a contraceptive agent for men, maintains similar pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties as were found for  the two steroids in separate gel formulations. If a combination Nestorone and T gel regimen is  effective at gonadotropin suppression, the NICHD may elect to conduct a larger study to  evaluate the product using contraceptive efficacy as the primary endpoint."

9388971,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The aggressive and unpredictable nature of relapsed T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) represents a major clinical challenge, in large part due to highly toxic and ineffective chemotherapies. Further advances in therapy will require a detailed understanding of the molecular underpinnings of T- ALL development and relapse. To this end, I have completed a highly innovative screen in zebrafish to identify genes associated with T-ALL progression and have found that the protein tyrosine phosphotase PRL-3 was commonly amplified in single T-ALL cells as they developed increased ability to form relapse over time. In transgenic animals, PRL-3 over-expression significantly enhanced primary T-ALL development and relapse formation. I have found that PRL-3 amplified in a subset of human T-ALL and is highly expressed by a majority of T-ALL patient samples. These cells are also sensitive to PRL-3 knock-down through the induction of apoptosis. These results imply that PRL-3 activity has an important role in T-ALL malignancy, and that PRL-3 and its substrates may represent novel therapeutic targets for the treatment of T-ALL. The objectives of this proposal are to 1) define the contribution of PRL-3 to T- ALL progression and relapse and 2) identify the mechanism by which PRL-3 drives T-ALL malignancy. This objective will be achieved through two specific aims. During the K99 phase of this award, I will complete Aim 1, where I will examine the effect of PRL-3 gain-of-function and loss-of-function in various stages of T-ALL development in zebrafish, including invasion from the thymus, intravasation, proliferation and relapse, and I will also test the effects of PRL-3 knock-down on human cells in a murine xenograft model. During this phase, I will learn techniques to directly image cancer progression in live animals and to develop orthotopic leukemia xenografts in mice. With this knowledge in hand, during the R00 phase I will complete Aim 2, where I will identify the target substrates of PRL-3 in T-ALL cells, and test the contribution of these genes and pathways to T-ALL malignancy using in vivo and in vitro epistasis experiments. In total, this work will lay the foundation for the development of small molecule PRL-3 and pathway inhibitors for potential therapeutic use in T-ALL. The mentored phase of this award will occur under the guidance of Dr. David Langenau, an expert in zebrafish models of cancer, and Dr. Thomas Look, an internationally recognized leader in the field of leukemia research. Their proven track record of mentorship, coupled with an intensive didactic component and the rigorous and nurturing academic environment offered by the research community of Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School offer the best opportunity for my success as I transition to becoming an independent investigator."

9547681,"A 1996 congressional mandate founded the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Pain Consortium (www.painconsortium.nih.gov). The NIH Pain Consortium includes representatives from 24 NIH Institutes and Centers. Its purpose is to coordinate the NIH's pain research and dissemination activities. In 2010, the NIH Pain Consortium held a workshop on the state of pain education in the education of future health care providers, including medical, dental, nursing, and pharmacy schools. The findings of this workshop were distressing. Although pain is the most commonly problem faced in medical practice, it receives relatively little attention in the education of health care providers. For example, on average, medical students receive only 8 hours of training on how to measure, diagnose, and treat pain. Relatedly, pain often is poorly treated, with some patients receiving the wrong pain treatment or far less medication than is warranted to provide relief, and others receiving too much medication, which places the patient at a high risk of addiction to pain medications. This situation is especially problematic since 100 million people in the United States suffer from persistent pain, and prescription pain medication abuse has reached epidemic proportions in the United States, with nearly 15,000 people dying each year as a result of In an effort to help improve pain treatment while reducing the prescription pain medication epidemic, the NIH Pain Consortium, in an effort led by the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), created an initiative to increase pain education in medical, nursing, pharmacy, and dental schools across our nation. The plan included support of Pain Champions at health care schools, who were people in these institutions who already realized the need to increase pain education, and could, with support from the NIH Pain Consortium, increase pain education in their institutions. The NIH Pain Consortium also remains committed to increasing and improving pain education even beyond the institutions that receive associated NIH funding. Thus, the funded Pain Champions are required to create interactive teaching tools, which other institutions can freely download and use to teach their students about pain and its treatment. the abuse of prescription pain medication. Key people in these health care crises are health care providers, who in general lack the necessary training to adequately treat pain or identify and minimize the risks of pain medication abuse or diversion by their patients. While the NIH Pain Consortium was building support for this initiative, the Institute of Medicine released a report mandated by the Affordable Care Act titled Relieving PAIN America. A Blueprint for Transforming Prevention, Care, Education, and Research. Education of health care providers on treating pain was a major emphasis of this report. Two recommendations in particular were: ? Recommendation 4-2 Improve curriculum and education for health care professionals. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the Health Resources and Service Administration, accrediting organizations, and undergraduate and graduate health professions training programs should improve pain education curricula for health care professionals, and ? Recommendation 4-3. Increase the number of health professionals with advanced expertise in pain care. Educational programs for medical, dental, nursing, mental health, physical therapy, pharmacy, and other health professionals who will participate in the delivery of pain care should have increased capacity to train providers who can offer advanced pain care. With this additional mandate and guideline, in 2012 the NIH Pain Consortium selected certain health professional schools as designated Centers of Excellence in Pain Education (CoEPEs). The CoEPEs are acting as hubs for the development, assessment, and distribution of pain management curriculum resources for medical, dental, nursing, and pharmacy schools to enhance and improve the teaching of health care professionals about pain and its treatment. These CoEPEs are increasing pain education in their institutions. They represent approximately 100 teaching units (departments, universities, teaching hospitals, etc.). They also are creating interactive web-based teaching modules for use in the CoEPEs and any other interested teaching institutions. Further, the CoEPEs plan to assess the success of their pain teaching programs and disseminate their results to the general health care education field to encourage other institutions to follow the lead of the CoEPEs and increase pain education. The NIH Pain Consortium supports the general principle that better education will lead to better treatment. In addition, the NIH Pain Consortium supports the persuasive argument that better pain treatment is necessary."

9569768,"The Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) Study was initiated in 1985 with two components: community-based surveillance and a prospective cohort study. The community surveillance aimed to monitor trends in hospitalized myocardial infarction (MI), fatal coronary heart disease (CHD) in four U.S. communities: Forsyth County, NC; Jackson, MS; suburbs of Minneapolis, MN; and Washington County, MD. Surveillance for hospitalized heart failure (HF) events was added in 2005. The communities were selected to provide data across four (4) geographic locations with a range of mortality rates, in urban, suburban, and rural settings. The cohort study aimed to investigate the risk factors for and natural history of atherosclerosis and development of clinical atherosclerosis in middle-aged white or African American adults from the same communities. The study recruited in 15,792 white or African American participants initially aged 45-64 years and selected participants received triennial clinical exams over the first ten years of the study (1987-1989, 1990-1992, 1993-1995, and 1996-1998), with a fifth clinical exam in 2011-2013, providing a rich set of data on physical, behavioral, genetic, and psychosocial factors. Since 1988, the cohort has been contacted annually and in 2011 semiannual follow-up was initiated. Findings have been presented in over 1,400 publications as of 2014. Participants were examined for evidence of subclinical atherosclerosis using B-mode ultrasound in carotid and popliteal arteries, ankle-brachial index measurement, and retinal photography and, in subsets, abdominal aortic CT, and hemostatic factors; established and putative laboratory risk markers; socioeconomic, psychological, behavioral, and environmental characteristics; and genetic factors.

9591574,"?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Primary cilia organize signaling pathways such as vision, olfaction and the Hedgehog developmental pathway. The movements of signaling receptors into, inside and out of cilium are critical for the correct regulation of these pathways, yet our understanding of the basic mechanisms governing signaling receptor trafficking through cilia remains fragmentary.  The major goal of this proposal is to study the BBSome, a protein complex that ferries signaling receptors into, inside and out of cilia. The emphasis in this fundin period will be on investigating the turnaround point during which anterograde trains become reconfigured into retrograde trains. While past studies have provided circumstantial evidence for the existence of IFT train turnaround at the tip of cilia, molecular mechanisms are lacking for thi critical step that commits molecules to be removed from cilia. The removal of signaling receptors from cilia may serve to desensitize cilia to specific stimuli and the ciliary export of signaling intermediates such as the Hedgehog effector and transcription Gli3 is required for them to reach their nuclear target. Yet, how molecules are exported from cilia remains elusive. Our preliminary data suggest a testable molecular model for the turnaround point and the assembly of retrograde BBSome/IFT trains. We will test this model using biochemistry and innovative live cell photokinetics assay."
9571681,"Although recent developments in highly sensitive technologies have revolutionized research on RNA modifications, the available quantitative methods can be further improved. Current methods include liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectroscopy (LC-MS/MS) and next-generation sequencing coupled with modification-specific antibodies. The LC-MS/MS method is not accessible to many researcher scientists due to its high cost and specialization. Deep sequencing is only useful for research on specific RNA modifications if high quality antibodies are commercially available. We found there are at least a dozen RNA modifications that are not commercially available, but have been suggested to be related to cancer, suggesting a gap in the antibody market. Furthermore, though antibody pull-down followed by RT-qPCR can be used to evaluate the modification of a specific RNA, this method is not site-specific, and will not work well when there are multiple modification sites in one targeted RNA. There is a need for a simpler method to quantitatively analyze site-specific RNA modifications beyond the current options available. Here, we propose to 1) fill the gap in next-generation sequencing approach by developing high-affinity antibodies for cancer-related modifications with no commercially available antibodies, and 2) develop simpler alternative methods for the site-specific quantification of RNA modifications using Mediomics? PINCER technology."

9572988,"Newborn screening programs currently screen more than 4 million U.S. infants per year. The intent of newborn screening is to detect potentially fatal or disabling conditions in newborns, thereby providing a window of opportunity for early treatment, often while the child is still asymptomatic. This public health program has saved countless lives through the identification of infants who are at risk for congenital disorders for which early interventions and treatments have the potential to reduce morbidity and mortality. In 2006 the American College of Medical Genetics (ACMG) developed newborn screening guidelines that recommend that all newborn infants be screened for 29 core conditions and that 25 secondary conditions identified during the core evaluations be reported. These recommendations have been accepted by the HHS Secretary's Advisory Committee on Heritable Disorders in Newborns and Children (ACHDNC) (authorized by the Children's Health Act of 2000), and the Secretary of HHS. Most states now use this or very similar panels for newborn screening. There has been broad acceptance of these screening guidelines by state screening laboratories, and interest in adding new tests that have been appropriately vetted to the recommended panel. In addition, under the Newborn Screening Saves Lives Act of 2007, the Hunter Kelly Newborn Screening Research Program within NICHD is authorized to carry out, coordinate, and expand research in newborn screening. Currently, policies related to newborn screening are determined through analysis of the severity and incidence of each condition under consideration, the specificity and sensitivity of the screening test, the natural history of the disorder, and the efficacy, safety, and effectiveness of treatments available for the disorder.    Newborn Screening Translational Research Network (NBSTRN) websiteThe Newborn Screening Translational Research Network (NBSTRN) is a resource for investigators engaged in newborn screening related research. As part of the Newborn Screening Saves Lives Act mandated by Congress, the Hunter Kelly Newborn Screening Program was established, with the NBSTRN Coordinating Center as a key component. The NBSTRN Coordinating Center is funded by a contract to the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) from the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities Branch (IDDB).    The primary goals of the NBSTRN are to:    Enable biomedical investigators, with appropriate IRB permission and privacy protections, to access dried bloodspots and other biological specimens in a site-independent manner for research  Support the needs of investigators to:  Evaluate the predictive value of biomarkers through early phase clinical/epidemiological studies  Facilitate the development and assessment of new methods and technologies to improve the capacity for early identification through newborn screening  Identify candidate diseases for inclusion in expanded newborn screening  Determine the effectiveness of treatments and long-term outcomes by means of studies involving screened and treated patients  Encourage collaboration among researchers and rapid dissemination of information to promote progress and avoid fragmentation of effort  Develop policies and procedures that support privacy and confidentiality of patient-related information as well as appropriate rules by which to conduct the research  The NBSTRN works collaboratively with other organizations involved in newborn screening related activities. These groups include both federal programs (the Health Resources and Services Administration, the National Library of Medicine, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) and organizations such as the Association for Public Health Laboratories, the Genetic Alliance, and the National Newborn Screening and Genetics Resource Center."
9575051,"The National Cancer Institute?s Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium (CPTAC) is a national effort to accelerate the understanding of the molecular basis of cancer through the application of large-scale proteome and genome analysis, or proteogenomics.  Launched in 2011, CPTAC pioneered the integrated proteogenomic analysis of colorectal, breast and ovarian cancer to reveal new insights into these cancer types, such as identification of proteomic-centric subtypes, prioritization of driver mutations by correlative analysis of copy number alterations and protein abundance, and understanding cancer-relevant pathways through posttranslational modifications.  CPTAC is currently leveraging its investment in cancer proteogenomics by characterizing additional cancer types, expanding its application through open-source community resources, and accelerating precision oncology by applying proteogenomics to questions of toxicity and resistance in clinical trials.  This is being achieved through a coordinated effort by CPTAC-affiliated Proteome Characterization Centers, Proteogenomic Translational Research Centers, and Proteogenomic Data Analysis Centers located throughout the country.  Global BioClinical (GBC) will collect tumor biospecimens for use in the CPTAC project.  All biospecimens will be sourced prospectively and collected according to the CPTAC protocol.

9600196,"?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There is currently considerable emphasis on strategies for eradicating HIV from infected individuals. Although much effort is focused on reactivating integrated provirus using small molecules, a second possibility is using broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) that are highly potent and active against diverse strains and clades of HIV. Recent evidence demonstrating the ability of bNAbs in delaying viral rebound after stopping antiretroviral treatment (ART) indicate that these antibodies may be able to clear or remove cells expressing envelope glycoprotein on their surface, effectively reducing the pool size of persistently-infected cells. We propose to investigate a role for bNAbs in actively eliminating or reducing the size of the persistent viral reservoir, in novel humanized models of ART-suppressed HIV infection that support antibody-effector function.  In the first of three specific aims, we will construct `gutted' or helper-dependent adenoviral (HDAd) vectors, encoding the heavy and light chains of three second-generation bNAbs, in view of the downstream intramuscular application in animal models described in Aims 2 and 3. In the second aim, these vectored bNABs will be tested in HIV-infected humanized BLT mice, in which viral loads will be suppressed to undetectable levels by ART, for measurements of the latent viral pool size by genomic DNA qPCR and viral outgrowth assays. In particular, novel humanized mouse models that have active complement and functional natural killer cells will be used to assess the role of bNAb effector function in shrinking the persistently infected reservoir. In the final aim, the vectored bNAbs will be tested for their ability to shrink viral reservoirs in humanized mice derived using peripheral blood leukocytes from ART-suppressed HIV+ patients with undetectable plasma viral loads.  On the basis of the investigations to be conducted in the R21 phase of this application, we anticipate establishing a critical role for bNAb-effector activit targeting persistent viral reservoirs. The R33 phase of the application will extend these studies to the testing of tetracycline-regulable bnAbs encoded in HDAds, possible due to large carrying capacity of HdAds (~30 kb). In addition to exploring newer, more potent bNAbs, we will also test the use of the recently described eCD4-Ig, that encodes both soluble CD4-Ig and a CCR5 peptidomimetic and ARM-Hs, which are bivalent small molecules capable of binding the CD4 binding pocket of gp160 and also recruiting anti-dinitrophenol antibodies for effector activity. This approach of using HDAds encoding bNAbs may also be combined with latency reversal agents, in order to clear out infected cells. The results of these investigations should accelerate the use of bNAbs as an adjunct to ART in the treatment of HIV disease, with the potential for functional eradication due to elimination or prevention of reactivation of persistently-infected cells."

9390063,"?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): NK cells recognize virally infected and malignant cells and respond by direct target cell killing and the production of inflammatory cytokines. In humans, we have shown that adoptive transfer of NK cells can induce remission in patients with refractory acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) and that hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) can cure AML. Although clinical success is seen in both settings, NK cell survival and function are often suboptimal after transplant, resulting in cancer relapse. We have shown that AML patients who reactivate latent human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) post-HCT reconstitute more terminally differentiated NK cells with potent effector function relative to those who do not reactivate HCMV or are HCMV seronegative. Several clinical studies have also recently shown that HCMV reactivation early after HCT is associated with reduced relapse risk. The molecular basis for enhanced NK cell differentiation and function in response to HCMV is unknown. We have extensive preliminary data showing that, in healthy HCMV seropositive donors and in transplant recipients that experience HCMV reactivation, populations of NK cells lacking the proximal signaling molecules FcR1g, SYK and EAT-2 expand. These novel NK cells have a genome wide epigenetic profile markedly similar to that of effector CD8+ T cells with a striking microRNA signature. They are present at stable frequencies over the course of at least one year, and they exhibit enhanced function in response to signaling through CD16. These cells appear to represent a human equivalent to adaptive or memory NK cells in mice that respond specifically to mouse cytomegalovirus (MCMV). Because of their functional and survival properties, there is considerable interest in being able to utilize them for immunotherapy. In this proposal, we aim to study the role of microRNAs in the differentiation of adaptive human NK cells upon HCMV reactivation in NK cells from our unique cohort of transplant patients using an unbiased, cutting-edge deep-sequencing approach. We will test the hypothesis that signaling through activating receptors is required for the expansion of adaptive NK cells and determine the role of pentameric HCMV protein complexes and high-affinity antibodies to these complexes in triggering expansion. We have preliminary data suggesting that the Notch/TCF-1 and Wnt signaling pathways are selectively induced in HCMV-induced adaptive NK cells, and we will study the role of both pathways in the development and differentiation of adaptive NK cells in depth using our well defined transplant cohorts and in vitro assays. We will also combine our recently developed xenogeneic model for adoptive human NK cell transfer with a new model for systemic HCMV infection in mice to study HCMV-induced adaptive NK cell survival, homing and function in vivo. Our team of leading basic and clinical NK cell biologists, HCMV experts and mouse immunologists are well positioned to perform these studies and translate them to therapies that can prime NK cells for potent function and prolonged survival for clinical use in the treatment of cancer."

Six thousand eight hundred and fourteen (6,814) participants were recruited from six Field Centers during 2000-2002 and examined for evidence of subclinical coronary atherosclerosis, using computed tomography, cardiac MRI, carotid ultrasound, flow-mediated brachial artery dilation, radial artery tomometry, ankle-brachial index measurement, and retinal photography and, in subsets, abdominal aortic CT, carotid MRI, cardiac MRI tagging for measures of regional myocardial function; established and putative laboratory risk markers; socioeconomic, psychological, behavioral, nutritional and environmental characteristics; and genetic factors. Selected components were repeated over three subsequent examinations through 2007. The cohort has been followed for clinical events since baseline to ascertain and characterize new clinical events and other changes in health status, including changes in medications. The four scientific objectives for the period 2008 through 2015 are (1) identify factors related to progression of subclinical to clinical CVD; (2) identify predictors of decline in ventricular function; (3) further understanding of the basis for racial/ethnic difference in CVD; and (4) provide a platform for in-depth ancillary studies of CVD and other areas. All surviving and willing members of the MESA cohort will be followed up during the time period and included in an fifth examination during 2010-2012.

This work will take advantage of a cohort of food allergy patients, available to this project, that display a wide variety of responses to food challenge and to interventional therapy. These include food allergic patients who differ in clinical manifestation at baseline, patient non- responder to therapy, patients who experience adverse reactions during therapy, patients that loss peanut sensitization during therapy but not at the end of an avoidance period and patient that gain long term tolerance to peanut as a result of immunotherapy. This investigation will be performed in the context of an Immune Tolerance Network funded Peanut Oral Immunotherapy trial and in the context of an Aravax funded peanut specific peptide immunotherapy trial. Both effector T cells and regulatory T cells will be examined and we will capitalize on epitope discovery from project 1 to probe peanut allergen epitope specific T cells. The proposed work will include the use of state-of art technologies such as pMHCII tetramer staining and dual CD154/CD137 assay allowing determination of the contribution of allergen epitope-specific T cells to the global peanut specific T cell responses. We will also explore the alterations that arise on TCR repertoire and transcriptional phenotype of peanut-specific T cells during clinical intervention. These information are pertinent for determining suitable target to guide the design of optimal allergy vaccines. We will finally determine the extent to which these T cell epitopes can be used as biomarker predicting which patients are most likely to benefit from these therapeutic interventions, which immune mechanisms are involved and screen out those candidates in whom immunotherapy may lead to unnecessary risks."

9431313,"PROJECT SUMMARY  Cystic fibrosis (CF) is one of the most common fatal pediatric respiratory diseases, affecting approximately 1 in 3500 children. The development of CFTR modulators has spawned a new era of hope for CF therapeutics. However, addressing the common F508del CFTR mutation has been challenging and CFTR modulator therapy for this mutation is only minimally effective. An improved understanding of F508del CFTR and its correction is the most critical therapeutic pursuit for CF patients.  I have recently shown that the cystic fibrosis genetic modifier TGF-? diminishes CFTR function, reduces CFTR synthesis, and impedes F508del correction. I have also reported that TGF-? is significantly increased in CF lungs and mediates its effects by microRNA-based signaling. Specifically, I have found that the microRNA 145 (miR-145) mediates TGF-? inhibition of CFTR expression and function, and also limits F508del correction by CFTR modulators. Discovery of this important underlying mechanism has stimulated me to expand my career goals to microRNA therapeutics. My central hypothesis is that miR-145 antagonism interrupts TGF-? suppression of CFTR synthesis and function in airway epithelia, representing an attractive therapeutic target. With K08 support, I will receive training to 1) investigate mechanisms of miRNA regulation of CFTR 2) deliver miRNA antagonists in vivo and 3) learn methods to quantify F508del therapeutic response in CF animal models. These training goals will help advance my career focus on microRNA therapy and will be achieved through the following Specific Aims: Specific Aim 1: Determine the in vitro mechanism of miR-145 inhibition of CFTR in airway epithelia. Specific Aim 2: Establish in vivo relevance of miR-145 manipulation to improve CFTR function. Specific Aim 3: Augment CFTR correction with miR-145 antagonists in preclinical CF animal models.  My training will be mentored by Dr. Steven Rowe (Director of the UAB Cystic Fibrosis Research Center and expert in CF translational science) and a panel of senior investigators in a fertile research environment with exceptional resources. Data obtained during the study period will establish the role of miR-145 inhibition to stabilize F508del modulation and introduce miRNA antagonists as a useful adjunct to CFTR directed therapeutics. Training provided by the K08 mechanism will facilitate my transition to research independence, creating a niche to investigate consequence of miRNA dysregulation in CF lungs and benefit of miR-145 antagonists to improve current and next generation F508del CFTR correction. These studies will establish a foundation for my career in CF translational science evaluating mechanisms of disease progression and therapeutic development."

9448901,"PROJECT SUMMARY Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are common, drive extensive antibiotic use, and are becoming increasingly resistant to treatment. There is general agreement that urinary chemical composition influences UTI pathogenesis, but this has been difficult to translate to clinical practice. Clinical urinary pathogens possess numerous genetic adaptations to the urinary environment, suggesting multiple selective pressures related to urinary composition. Recently, we identified individual differences in urine's ability to support antibacterial iron chelation by the innate immune protein siderocalin (SCN; also known as Lipocalin-2 or NGAL). Using mass spectrometry-based metabolomics and biochemical hypothesis-testing, we have mechanistically linked these differences to a specific chemical class of human urinary metabolites. Here we will identify human urinary metabolomic influences on SCN activity and other aspects of UTI pathogenesis. Because human urine is chemically complex, we will combine recent bioanalytical advances with contemporary data science approaches to identify metabolomic networks that influence bacterial growth and behavior. Our objective is to identify networks associated with SCN activity and bacterial growth, explore their mechanism(s) of action, and learn their physiologic origins as a basis for new prophylactic and therapeutic strategies. The proposed analyses and experiments are a rigorous initial evaluation of the hypothesis that urinary composition influences infection susceptibility and can be modified as a non-antibiotic therapy."

9327389,"Project Summary Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV/MERS) is a recently emerged zoonotic pathogen that has caused almost 1,800 cases and over 600 deaths since its 2012 discovery. MERS is the second virulent coronavirus to emerge in the last fifteen years, following SARS-CoV (SARS) in 2003, further demonstrating that coronaviruses are a continuing threat to global public health. While MERS, SARS, and the murine coronaviruses all belong to the same genus, Betacoronavirus, MERS is highly divergent from both and its genome encodes a novel set of accessory proteins. All viruses must manipulate diverse arms of the host antiviral response to ensure replicative success and transmission, and coronavirus accessory proteins participate in these essential functions. Due to its novelty and divergence from previously studied coronaviruses, the MERS accessory proteins are largely uncharacterized and lack significant sequence homology with other known viral proteins. We have used structural modeling to identify the MERS NS4b accessory protein as a homolog of the mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) NS2 accessory protein, which was previously described by our lab as an antagonist of the antiviral enzyme RNase L. Both proteins are homologs of the LigT-like 2H-phosphoesterases (2H-PEs), a large family of prokaryotic and eukaryotic proteins characterized by 2 HxS/T catalytic motifs separated by 80-100 amino acids. NS2 is critical for MHV replication in myeloid cells and the mouse liver, and inactivation of NS4b enzymatic activity results in RNase L activation during MERS infection of human airway epithelial Calu-3 cells. Antagonism of RNase L by either MHV NS2 or MERS NS4b is dependent on 2?,5? phosphodiesterase activity mediated by the catalytic histidines. Despite the similarity between these two proteins, our lab has identified striking differences and significant preliminary data which, combined with reports in the literature that NS4b can antagonize expression from the interferon- ? promoter in reporter assays, suggest it has an additional function as compared to MHV NS2. Notably, whereas MHV NS2 is exclusively cytoplasmic, MERS NS4b contains a strong, functional NLS and localizes primarily to the nucleus. Our lab previously demonstrated that nuclear localization is completely dispensable for antagonizing RNase L, and the NS4b NLS is conserved in all known MERS-like viruses, strongly supporting the idea of a nuclear function. Additionally, whereas MHV NS2 cleaves only 2?-5? linked phosphodiester bonds, MERS NS4b cleaves both 2?-5? and 3?-5? linked bonds, giving it broader substrate range and the ability to process RNA, as some prokaryotic and eukaryotic 2H-PEs are known to do. Our preliminary data strongly suggest that NS4b post-transcriptionally processes host mRNAs associated with the antiviral response and cell death, doing so in the nucleus through its enzymatic activity. Therefore, MERS NS4b is likely the first known viral 2H-PE to act in the nucleus. This research may illuminate a new mechanism by which coronaviruses interact with the host, and determine whether NS4b is a plausible therapeutic target during MERS infection."

9412468,"?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal seeks support jointly for the 2016 Photosensory Receptors & Signal Transduction Gordon Research Conference (GRC) and associated Gordon Research Seminar (GRS), to be held January in 23-29, 2016 at Hotel Galvez in Galveston, Texas and in the spring of 2018, most likely in April at the GRC site Renaissance Tuscany Il Ciocco Resort, Lucca, Italy. This biennial meeting is one of the most prestigious forums for participants to discuss topics at the frontiers of photobiological and biomedical research. Since it began 15 years ago, this GRC series has regularly brought together leading researchers and developing scientists from across the world. About half of the participants will be from the USA and half from Europe, Asia, Oceania and South America, reflecting the active international community in this scientific area. The 2016 and 2018 conferences will continue to provide a unique platform to unite researchers from a diverse range of subfields and disciplines to discuss and share new results and emerging approaches on natural and synthetic photosensory systems. Although photobiology largely originated in the plant sciences and is still strongly represented there, it now embraces a multitude of other experimental organisms such as bacteria, fungi and mammals. Researchers working on fundamental aspects of hot sensory biology will be united with those focused on developing new technologies in the applied field known as optogenetics. This fast-moving field spans the range from molecular to clinical, with practitioners developing methodologies aimed at directing gene expression, modifying the transmission of nerve impulses and restoring vision. A key to extending such tools is harnessing the diversity of photoreceptor systems that are available in nature. The continued efforts of this GRC/GRS series will ensure that the breadth of these disciplinary interactions is maintained and further developed through vigorous discussion and collaboration. Other unique features of this conference include: a 2:1 (talk versus discussion) time for oral presentations; the sheltered meeting venues where participants dine and socialize together outside of the sessions, afternoon social activities planned to promote networking, and poster displays accessible throughout the day and following evening sessions to maximize exposure, as well as space reserved within the main GRC program for short oral presentations to promote talented graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, and junior faculty poster presentations. The closely associated GRS will also allow students and postdoctoral researchers to bring forth their latest developments in the field, lay the scientific groundwork in areas these junior scientists may be less familiar with, and offer explicit mentoring led by senior scientists in informal, round-table discussions aimed at broad aspects of career development. In each case, the breadth of topics and the diversity of techniques employed in this highly multidisciplinary field will attract a diverse group of scientists with a common interest in photosensory function and application."

9569767,"The Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) Study was initiated in 1985 with two components: community-based surveillance and a prospective cohort study. The community surveillance aimed to monitor trends in hospitalized myocardial infarction (MI), fatal coronary heart disease (CHD) in four U.S. communities: Forsyth County, NC; Jackson, MS; suburbs of Minneapolis, MN; and Washington County, MD. Surveillance for hospitalized heart failure (HF) events was added in 2005. The communities were selected to provide data across four (4) geographic locations with a range of mortality rates, in urban, suburban, and rural settings. The cohort study aimed to investigate the risk factors for and natural history of atherosclerosis and development of clinical atherosclerosis in middle-aged white or African American adults from the same communities. The study recruited in 15,792 white or African American participants initially aged 45-64 years and selected participants received triennial clinical exams over the first ten years of the study (1987-1989, 1990-1992, 1993-1995, and 1996-1998), with a fifth clinical exam in 2011-2013, providing a rich set of data on physical, behavioral, genetic, and psychosocial factors. Since 1988, the cohort has been contacted annually and in 2011 semiannual follow-up was initiated. Findings have been presented in over 1,400 publications as of 2014. Participants were examined for evidence of subclinical atherosclerosis using B-mode ultrasound in carotid and popliteal arteries, ankle-brachial index measurement, and retinal photography and, in subsets, abdominal aortic CT, and hemostatic factors; established and putative laboratory risk markers; socioeconomic, psychological, behavioral, and environmental characteristics; and genetic factors.

9517629,"The Division of Intramural Population Health Research (DIPHR) conducts research on a variety of topics pertaining to human reproduction and development, child and adolescent health and behaviors, and care of pregnant women among other topics. Both observational and interventional research is designed and implemented by Division scientists, and most research includes multi-faceted collection of data and biospecimens. This includes subgroups of the population such as infants and children, who are likely to have even lower concentrations than adults. All biospecimens are collected using approved protocols and are de-identified prior banking in NICHD-supported repositories. A wide range of biospecimen  types are collected including whole blood, plasma, serum, peritoneal fluid, urine, saliva, tissue (e.g. omental fat), organs (e.g., placenta), hair, nails, follicular and seminal fluids, semen, and newborn blood spots. The Division conducts research focusing on the relationship between environmental exposures and human reproduction and development, as broadly defined. The Division defines environment as non-genetic, including environmental chemicals, diet, and lifestyle. Within the scope of environmental chemicals, both persistent (e.g., metals and trace elements, organochlorine pesticides, perfluorochemicals, polybrominated biphenyls, polychlorinated biphenyls, polybrominated diphenyl ethers) and non-persistent (e.g. parabens, phenols, phthalates) chemicals are of interest. Of note is the Division?s research focusing on emerging classes of chemicals as well as biomarkers of lifestyle exposures and diet. Moreover, ophisticated aliquoting schemes are typically required for much of the Division?s research to enable additional biomedical laboratory analyses to compliment the environmental analyses. For example, a plasma sample may be used for the quantification of persistent chemicals and for metabolomic analyses, while a urine sample may be analyzed for both short-lived chemicals, such as phthalates, and for reproductive hormones."

9589169,"NIH DRUG DISCOVERY AND DEVELOPMENT CONSULTING SERVICES  STATEMENT OF WORK  A. BACKGROUND  The National Institutes of Health (NIH) is the nation?s leading medical research agency and the primary Federal agency whose mission is to seek fundamental knowledge about the nature and behavior of living systems and the application of that knowledge to enhance health, lengthen life, and reduce illness and disability, conducting, supporting and making medical discoveries that improve people?s health and save lives.    The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) is a part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), conducting research into the causes, treatment, and prevention of neurological disorders and stroke. The NINDS mission is to seek fundamental knowledge about the brain and nervous system and to use that knowledge to reduce the burden of neurological disease.  The NIH Blueprint for Neuroscience Research, a consortium of 8 NIH Institutes and Centers that support neuroscience research, established the Blueprint Neurotherapeutics Network (BPN) as a pipeline between the typical endpoint of NIH-funded research and the beginning of industry drug development. The BPN provides neuroscience researchers with funding and access to a full range of industry-style drug development services and expertise. The program is intended for projects requiring medicinal chemistry optimization and contract research organization (CRO) support through phase I clinical testing. Each project is directed by a Lead Development Team (LDT) composed of the principal investigator (PI), industry consultants hired by NIH, and NIH staff. This team maps out a research strategy, including milestones, and oversees implementation by CROs. Bioactivity and efficacy studies are funded through an award to the PI; other research services are provided without cost to the PI through NIH contracts.  B. STATEMENT OF OBJECTIVE   The NIH is seeking senior-level, industry-experienced drug discovery and development consultants with expertise in the following specific discipline to provide leadership and technical guidance on drug discovery and development projects in the BPN and possibly other NIH drug discovery and development projects and programs:   ? Drug Metabolism and Pharmacokinetics  C.  SCOPE OF WORK    Each consulting contract will be specific to one or more areas of expertise as outlined in this Statement of Work, and will reflect the NIH time commitment needs for the specific areas of expertise.   Consultants hired under this requirement will not only make significant contributions to promising drug discovery and development projects that have been selected through a rigorous peer-review process, they will also help shape an innovative, high-profile program that may serve as a model for future NIH drug discovery efforts.   Contract consultants will be expected to provide feedback and guidance on programs and projects to the NIH and to BPN LDT members through conference calls and by email. Consultants may serve on an ad hoc basis or as members of LDTs. Consultants will be expected to offer input on project milestones, development strategy, study design, and data interpretation. Specific consulting responsibilities will depend on the expertise of the individual consultant and the needs of individual projects and programs.

9579884,"Scope or Objectives  As a follow-up to the success of its initial precision oncology trials (NCI-MATCH and NCI-COG Pediatric MATCH), DCTD is developing a portfolio of clinical trials in the ET-CTN that will systematically identify new drugs to treat newly discovered molecular abnormalities of clinical significance. The product of this TORFP 17-090 A National Clinical Laboratory Network for NCI Precision Oncology  8/26/2017 Page 2 of 15   clinical trial portfolio is expected to be an increased number of molecular abnormalities that can be matched to targeted therapies ? a critical step in creating the treatment arms of the next generation MATCH-like trial. In addition, these ET-CTN trials will also assess drug molecular mechanism of action (mMOA) and reveal if the pharmacodynamics (PD) of each drug varies when matched to particular variants of the molecular abnormality. To conduct the ET-CTN portfolio trials, a precision oncology clinical trial laboratory network is needed to provide robust, specialized fit-for-purpose analyses of patient specimens with a reliability that will assure reproducible assay performance when the assays are incorporated into the next generation MATCH trial to assign patients to therapy.  The MoCha lab and CPP (composed of PADIS, NCTVL and IQC labs) are requested to support a National Clinical Laboratory Network (NCLN) for Precision Oncology by establishing, participating in, leading and assuring the quality of a national network of clinical laboratories capable of providing robust, reliable and relevant clinical assays that are harmonized across laboratories. The NCLN will provide complete assay services (i.e. fit-for-purpose clinical assays) covering all required aspects of molecular characterization (including the Oncomine assay), diagnostic protein assays and pharmacodynamic assays of patient specimens in the ET-CTN. The NCLN must have the flexibility to incorporate newly developed clinical assays and assay technologies that are important for matching patients with targeted agents and work within different regulatory environments (CLIA or not).  The clinical assay locations that comprise the NCLN will be available in time to contribute to all aspects of the selected NCI sponsored trials in the ET-CTN precision oncology portfolio: clinical protocol development; IRB (or cIRB) approval and activation of the trial; specimen collection, shipping, processing/handling, tracking and accountability; clinical sample analyses; quality controlled supply lines of key reagents and reference samples; proficiency testing and other quality assurance strategies; timely reporting of assay results to clinical sites; organized storage of cumulative assay results; and analysis and reporting of assay results to clinical investigators."

9571107,"There is a demand for estrogen-free contraception in order to reduce the risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE), particularly for obese women. A new oral contraceptive agent consisting of a progesterone receptor modulator, which does not affect endogenous estrogen levels, has been developed. Ulipristal acetate (UPA) has been used in a single high dose for emergency contraception and has been used continuously for up to six months for treatment of uterine fibroids. Low dose continuous usage of oral UPA is anticipated to inhibit ovulation and provide an estrogen free, bleed free method of contraception.   The Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institutes of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) has a mission to develop safe and effective contraceptives for women, including obese women. Obesity is the number one public health issue facing the US population and is an independent risk for venous thromboembolism (VTE). Therefore, there is a public health need to develop effective contraception for woman that does not increase the risk of VTE. One Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved contraceptive method is the progestin-only pill (POP). This method requires strict adherence to taking the POP at the same time every day. The method is associated with irregular bleeding which often leads to discontinuation of the method. Daily low dose oral progesterone receptor modulators (PRMs), such as UPA, have been shown to inhibit ovulation and cause amenorrhea. The endogenous estrogen level is not affected by the PRM. Thus, the method will provide a regimen that is easier to follow than POP regimen and have a theoretically lower risk of VTE, especially for obese women. In addition, there is in vitro evidence that UPA may have protective activity against breast cancer. In order to provide preliminary evidence that daily, low dose UPA could be effective for contraception, a clinical trial will be conducted in the NICHD Contraceptive Clinical Trials Network (CCTN). The proposed study will be evaluated sequentially. Initially, women of reproductive age, with normal menstrual cycles, will receive treatment for 12 weeks (three 28-day cycles) in order to evaluate the mechanisms of contraceptive efficacy, safety and acceptability of this new contraceptive."

The current method for these linkages requires the researcher to work directly with each registry involved in the follow-up process including preparing and completing IRB documents, working with the registry to submit a standard dataset. This often requires significant time and resources and frequently there are no matches. For a large cohort study this may involve direct contact with a large percent of the State and regional central cancer registries in the United States.   The purpose of the VPR project is to create a capacity similar to the National Death Index without the creation of an aggregated national level cancer patient database. The VPR will consist of ?one stop shop? process through which an interested researcher could submit one research application and one research file which will undergo one standardized linkage simultaneously at multiple registries."

9519200,"Project Summary/Abstract:  Small vessel cerebrovascular disease is a major risk factor in Alzheimer?s disease. However, quantitative biomarkers that are suitable for use as endpoints in clinical trials for these conditions are still lacking. The goals of the present project are to 1) in the UH2 phase, evaluate and identify MRI-based microvascular biomarkers that are diagnostic and predictive, with a particular focus on a novel marker referred to as cerebrovascular reactivity; 2) in the UH3 phase, work with the Coordinating Center and other projects in the consortium to further evaluate the most promising biomarker candidates in a multi-site setting.  Conventional anatomic imaging (e.g. T2-FLAIR) can identify white matter hyperintensities that represent the consequence of small vessel damage. In this project, we will emphasize several newer techniques that probe the potential physiological driving force of small vessel cognitive impairment and dementia (VCID). Specifically, we will focus on a marker indexing the dynamic coupling capacity of the neurovascular unit, referred to here as cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR). Our previously studies on CVR have revealed that: 1) CVR is three times as sensitive to age as resting perfusion. 2) CVR is diminished in patients with AD dementia. 3) Decline in processing speed (over four years) is significantly associated with CVR decline (over four years). 4) CVR of the brain is strongly correlated with structural lesions as seen on T2-FLAIR. Therefore, the present project will emphasize the development of CVR MRI as a small vessel imaging biomarker, with additional consideration of several other microvascular parameters including microbleeds count and cerebral blood flow (CBF). These small vessel measures (vascular imaging markers) will be combined into a composite index based on their contributions to cognitive impairment, which will form a composite imaging biomarker for diagnosis, prediction, and target engagement of VCID.  Our Specific Aims in the UH2 phase are: 1) Examine the association between cognitive function and candidate vascular imaging markers in a group of elderly individuals with mixed vascular and Alzheimer?s pathology; 2) Conduct technical assessment of the vascular imaging methods to show that they are multi-site ready in terms of applicability and reproducibility; 3) Work with Coordinating Center and other Development Projects to establish the consortium in preparation for the UH3 phase. Quantifiable milestones have been defined for these aims and for the readiness of the project to enter the UH3 phase, in which the specific aim is to perform collaborative studies as part of the small vessel biomarker consortium to further evaluate and develop the most promising biomarker candidates.  Impact: Upon the completion of this project, we will have developed a small vessel imaging biomarker that is ready for large scale multi-site clinical validation studies."

9555905,"NIAID is committed to research necessary to end the HIV/AIDS epidemic and in finding new and more effective immune based therapies that complement antiretroviral drug combinations (cART). HIV prevention vaccines are designed to address outcomes of exposure in uninfected persons, i.e. acquisition of virus or attenuation of viral load when infection occurs.  Thus far, such vaccines have not demonstrated therapeutic efficacy when used in infected subjects. Thus the need exists for innovative therapeutic biological products that work in infected persons. Recent research has also identified numerous anti-HIV neutralizing antibodies with properties that suggest they may be useful as therapeutic agents. These antibodies have useful and novel properties including potency, broad ranges of neutralization, and other antibody-mediated effector functions. Additional research indicates certain antibodies may be engineered to improve binding specificity, potency, or antibody effector function. There is also heightened interest in the possibility of HIV eradication or sustained remission based on one apparent HIV cure due to therapeutic bone marrow transplant, and one apparent cure due to immediate and aggressive antiretroviral therapy in a newborn.  There is also a specific interest in therapeutic anti-HIV vaccine, anti-HIV antibody products, or other immune-based anti-HIV products being part of a cure armamentarium to be tested as part of HIV sustained suppression/eradication human clinical trials to determine safety and efficacy."
9571847,"Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are a novel class of non-coding RNAs that are an abundant component of the epitranscriptome. Putative functions of circRNAs, include miRNA sequestration, RNA-binding protein scaffolding, mRNA trapping, and protein translation regulation. Deregulation in one or more of these roles has been linked to several types of cancer, including pancreatic cancer, basal cell carcinoma, and gliomas. One well-studied circRNA, ciRS-7, is believed to act as a miRNA-7 sponge and inhibit its regulation of oncogenic receptors and tumor suppressor factors. Despite all the excitement around circRNAs, many of the recently discovered circRNAs remain poorly understood and progress has been extremely slow. An important reason is the lack of easy-to-use tools to study individual circRNA. Recognizing this unmet need, we propose to develop a simple fluorogenic assay platform to detect circRNAs of interest in biochemical and cell lysate-based samples. In phase I, we will develop a circRNA sensor assay that will specifically recognize ciRS-7 and emit fluorescence signal. Due to portable nature of the proposed assay platform, the ciRS-7 sensor can be easily modified to recognize other circRNAs of interest. Once developed, the circRNA sensor platform would find applications in circRNA research, drug discovery, and biomarker diagnostics."

9574271,"Throughout the years, several practical problems have discouraged drug testing in children. These include the lack of a suitable infrastructure to conduct pediatric pharmacology research; the unforeseeable nature of some clinical responses in immature individuals; the possibility of unanticipated adverse reactions; the threat of effects on growth, development or health, long after the drug's administration, and difficulties predicting dose or concentration-response relationships by extrapolating data obtained in adults or experimental animals. Researchers and clinicians involved in pediatric drug development face daily challenges that include, but are not limited to the following: the need to obtain parental permission and/or the child's assent; ethical issues related to the conduct of non-therapeutic research in children; the lack of technology applicable to children; and the lack of incentives that would encourage pharmaceutical companies to study drugs in neonates, infants and children.

9551829,"?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The importance of new methods to regulate immune responses is underscored by the difficulty of generating effective vaccines for diseases like HIV, tuberculosis, or cancer. To exploit the full potential of the immune system, the antigen features that lead ultimately to tolerance or immunity must be defined. To expedite the generation of antigens that elicit desired immune responses, a fundamental knowledge is needed of how antigen processing cells (APCs) and the downstream responses that result are influenced by antigen structure. Chemical synthesis provides access to well-defined antigens that vary in valency, elasticity, the identity and number of immune receptors they target, and the proteases that can process them. The four Specific Aims have been devised to leverage synthetic methods from chemistry and chemical biology to generate tailored synthetic antigens to dissect critical steps in immune system function. In the previous grant period, we developed strategies to assemble chemically defined epitopes that target receptors on B cells or the lectins on dendritic cells. We demonstrated that by displaying specific epitopes on a polymer backbone, we could devise antigens that bind the B cell receptor to activate or tolerize B cells. We shall leverage the synthetic methods and building blocks that resulted from those investigations to synthesize chemically defined antigens to pinpoint attributes critical for immunity. A key element of our approach is the use of state-of-art polymer chemistry to vary antigen features, such that the requisite properties can be identified. In Aim 1, we shall use defined antigens to address how valency influences antigen signaling and trafficking in B cells and dendritic cells (DCs) but also how antigen valency influences the ability of these APCs to activate T cells. In Aim 2, we shall synthesize nanoparticles to test the hypothesis that increases in antigen stiffness will augment B cell and dendritic cell activation, facilitate antigen uptake and processing, and therefore promote immunity. In Aim 3, we shall produce antigens to exploit the vacuolar pathway to elicit cross presentation and thereby augment immunity by activating cytotoxic T cell responses. In Aim 4, we shall use the blueprints that emerge from Aims 1-3 to generate antigens that induce potent in vivo immune responses. We anticipate that progress on the proposed Aims will yield new strategies to recruit the immune system to treat human disease."

This initiative was begun by the DHHS Office of Population Affairs [OPA] in 1984, when they established a public-use archive of computerized data on adolescent pregnancy and pregnancy prevention data, including data files, with all identifiers removed. Sociometrics was the contractor for this service. This Sociometrics archive now contains more than 150 studies. It has made extant data accessible, so that not all research projects addressing adolescent pregnancy prevention or interventions are needed to initiate costly data collection efforts. In order to select appropriate studies for the archive, ongoing federally funded and other research projects were evaluated as to their scientific quality, by a panel of experts in the area of teen pregnancy prevention research. Those studies that met the standards stated in the original OPA guidelines, as revised, were included in the archive. It is available for purchase in CD Rom format and by download from the web by Sociometrics with supporting documentation including the data collection instruments used in the original studies. The cost for purchasing this data covers the costs incurred by Sociometrics to duplicate the data. Over the intervening years, sufficient numbers of users of the data archives have been developed so that the ongoing maintenance of the holdings has become self-sustaining. In addition, the contractor started, with separate funding, a data archive on intervention programs and training in the use of selected intervention programs. This archive was named PASHA. NICHD contributed to the early development costs of PASHA through an interagency agreement. The CDC and OPA no longer contribute to the archiving, due to lack of funds. But the project remains funded by NICHD and is included in the follow-on award.

9618294,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In Africa, children carry a large proportion of the burden of tuberculosis (TB). Recent studies suggest that first line anti-TB drugs (isoniazid, rifampin, ethambutol and pyrazinamide) are often under-dosed in adults, especially with HIV, and children. In 2010, the World Health Organization (WHO) proposed a revised mg/kg dosing strategy for anti-TB drugs for children. The revised guidelines are based on a very limited body of data. As there is a non-linear relationship between weight and drug clearance, the standardized mg/kg dosing is likely to result in under-dosing in small children compared to larger children. The PIs propose to evaluate the 2010 WHO dosing guidelines by assessing the pharmacokinetics of first line anti-TB drugs in 240 children across pediatric populations (<12 years, HIV infected and uninfected, and varied nutritional status) and regions (Cape Town, South Africa and Blantyre, Malawi). Improving the understanding of the pharmacokinetics of first line anti-TB drugs in children will aid in the development of evidence-based guidelines for pediatric TB treatment. In sub-Saharan Africa, the burden of HIV infection in children remains high. Important management challenges in children with TB and HIV include drug-drug interactions and overlapping drug toxicities. Co-administration of rifampicin dramatically reduces the concentrations of protease inhibitors. Using double dose lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r) in the commercially available 4:1 ratio has been shown to be insufficient. LPV/r in a ratio of LPV/r=1:1 results in adequate pharmacokinetic parameters but is not feasible because of the complexity of dosing LPV/r and ritonavir separately, and the short shelf life of oral ritonavir solution. Alternative solutions for the management of HIV and TB concomitantly in children are thus urgently needed. The PIs propose to evaluate an 8-hourly weight band-based dosing strategy for LPV/r using commercially available LPV/r in children receiving rifampicin-based TB treatment. In many settings nevirapine (NVP)-based regimens remain the only effective ART available. Young children may be at high risk of subtherapeutic NVP in the presence of rifampin. The proposed research will define optimal dosing of anti-TB drugs in children and generate evidence for optimization TB/HIV co-infection in children."
9578565,"Otomagnetics has invented a magnetic drug delivery device that we intend to develop to enable prevention of a major side effect of chemotherapy in children. Cisplatin and carboplatin chemotherapy regimens can lead to severe hearing loss, especially in pediatric patients. For cisplatin, hearing loss is FDA listed on-label as a dose limiting toxicity. Hearing loss in kids has a dramatic impact on their ability to communicate and learn and is associated with substantial cognitive and speech development deficits. Otomagnetics' drug delivery technology enables topical delivery of otoprotective therapy to the cochlea, and in animal studies has been shown to save hearing from cisplatin regimens. Topical and non-invasive magnetic delivery of a small dose of otoprotective steroid to the cochlea would not interrupt the systemic anti-tumor action of chemotherapy, and in some patients would remove limits on administering needed chemo doses due to induced severe hearing loss."

Some studies may also address transfusion recipient safety concerns such as evaluating non-infectious transfusion risks (e.g., alloimmunization) and ways to reduce their occurrence."
9576593,"Contractor will design and build a fully automated, self-contained drone platform to enable repetitive tasks in a laboratory environment - specifically, High throughput Screening (HTS) by robotic loading and unloading of microplates in a bio-research laboratory. Such a platform has the potential to be far more attractive than traditional robots in the realm of indoor logistics because they can be adapted to be infinitely configurable with respect to waypoints; can transport material over long distances; and unlike traditional robots, do not adversely impact the real estate envelope of the laboratory or require rearrangement of equipment in a laboratory. Contractor will use commercially available components to a large extent, and combine them with innovative mechanics, sensor, software and actuation solutions. The resulting platform will allow fully autonomous operation with minimal operator intervention requirements, and yet provide high accuracy in material movement, low failure rates, easy to use software driven interfaces, and a high degree of safety to allow the drones to operate within the bio-laboratory in the presences of humans and other bstacles. The drone platform will largely eliminate the need for labor intensive repetitive logistics operations and also provide attractive productivity enhancements within the bio-laboratory sector."

9470507,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) affects millions of individuals in the United States, and is highly costly to society (11,12). In recent years, research on the functional importance of many of ASD-linked genes suggest that components of Neuronal Homeostatic Plasticity are important (1). Homeostatic plasticity provides negative feedback to stabilize neuronal function and works in opposition to destabilizing learning- and experience- associated plasticity. While homeostatic plasticity has been well described, which and how homeostatic mechanisms are altered in ASD remains unknown. This proposal aims to determine which homeostatic mechanisms are altered in ASD and how those alterations affect single neuron and network stability. I hypothesize that ASD-linked mutations affect both homeostasis of neuronal synapses and excitability, giving rise to unstable neural networks ultimately responsible for subserving sensory processing and behavior. I will utilize our model of Timothy Syndrome, a syndromic form of ASD (33,34). In vitro preparations enable me to precisely dissect the mechanisms involved, while in vivo investigations will determine if these altered mechanisms are at play in the animal. I have identified that homeostatic plasticity in neurons expressing the TiS mutation is exaggerated. By chronically blocking action potentials in dissociated cortical cultures for 24hrs with tetrodotoxin (TTX), neurons globally increase their excitatory synaptic weights and their excitability. In TiS neurons, these increases are exaggerated beyond the levels of neurons without the TiS mutation. In Aims 1 & 2, I will determine which molecular mechanisms are involved. Specifically, through a series of electrophysiology and molecular biology experiments, Aim 1 will investigate the role of calcium- permeable AMPARs in mediating exaggerated synaptic homeostasis. Aim 2 will identify what underlying molecular processes are involved in the exaggeration of neuronal firing and excitability in TiS neurons. I will determine whether exaggeration of excitability is mediated by axon initial segment regulation, or by phosphorylation of particular ion channels. I predict that altered regulation of these mechanisms are responsible for functional exaggeration of homeostasis. Furthermore, I hypothesize that this exaggeration in neurons results in maladaptive homeostatic plasticity for networks. In Aim 3, I will describe how the TiS mutation affects neural network activity using electrophysiology and calcium imaging. With pharmacological manipulations, I will dissect which of the previously described homeostatic mechanisms are responsible. I will also determine if maladaptive homeostasis in TiS results in tonic asynchronous or coordinated hypersynchronous activity. The results of this study will elucidate the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms of ASD and may provide a generalizable framework for distinguishing ASD subtypes."

This mission is made even more important by the expansion of NIAID clinical networks and grants into international resource-limited settings, where basic standards of clinical virology laboratory testing vary widely from country to country, and by the increasing number and complexity of the assays being used throughout the world. There is also a need to standardize and evaluate new virologic methods to ensure their comparability to the older versions that have been in use by NIAID clinical trial network laboratories. Since modifications of the FDA-approved versions of these assays are often being sold outside the US and are being used in many non-US laboratories, these modifications must also be evaluated. Lower cost alternative assays and point-of-care assays will become necessary in order to sustainably monitor the large numbers of people who are/will be on anti-HIV therapy. There is a need for evaluation of these new technologies. NIAID-supported clinical trial networks depend on the VQA for the proficiency programs and for the assay evaluation studies.

9261044,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Due to the significant gaps in the understanding of mechanisms controlling tumor-promoting signaling pathways, mammary cancer remains the 2nd most common cancer diagnosed and the 2nd leading cause of death in women. Over the past few decades, hyperactive Wnt/?-catenin signaling has been linked to the development of multiple cancers, including mammary cancer, making identification of molecules regulating Wnt/?-catenin signaling crucial to the development of mammary cancer treatment strategies. Betaglycan is a transmembrane proteoglycan co-receptor that can exist with or without heparan and/or chondroitin sulfate glycosaminoglycan (GAG) modifications whose significance is underscored by embryonic lethality in mice and roles in regulating cancer cell biology, independent of its TGF-? coreceptor functions. The goal of this research proposal is to define the specific role of the differentially modified forms of Betaglycan on Wnt3a signaling in epithelial cancer models. To accomplish our goal, three aims will be pursued. Aim 1 will delineate the role of differentially modified Betaglycan in regulating Wnt3a signaling through the use of CRISPR/Cas replacements of full length Betaglycan with modified versions of Betaglycan lacking either its heparan sulfate (HS), chondroitin sulfate (CS) or both GAG chains. In this aim, we will test the hypothesis that HS Betaglycan suppresses Wnt signaling while CS Betaglycan enhances Wnt signaling. Aim 2 will focus on delineating changes in Wnt3a/Frizzled/Betaglycan interactions regulated by differentially modified Betaglycan by testing the hypothesis that HS Betaglycan sequesters Wnt3a through high affinity interactions resulting in less Frizzled/Betaglycan complexes while CS Betaglycan weakly interacts with Wnt3a promoting Frizzled/Betaglycan complex formation to enhance Wnt signaling. Aim 3, will determine the effects of differentially modified Betaglycan on mammary tumorigenesis in vitro and in vivo by testing the hypothesis that HS Betaglycan is responsible for suppressing epithelial tumor growth and metastasis while CS Betaglycan enhances epithelial tumor growth and metastasis, in part, through changes in Wnt signaling. Several combinations of biochemical techniques in vitro and syngeneic orthotopic studies in vivo will be used to address the aims. At the completion of these studies, we fully expect to define the specific roles of HS and CS modified BG in modulating Wnt activity and epithelial tumorigenesis. Our research will thus be relevant to public health as we will broaden our current understanding of mechanisms controlling tumorigenesis."

9574580,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second leading cause of cancer-related mortality in the US, with more than 1.35 million new cases diagnosed each year. Although non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as aspirin and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors were shown to be effective in preventing CRC in animal models and in the clinic, their use is severely limited by gastrointestinal and cardiovascular toxicities. Thus, there is an unmet need for the identification of safer chemopreventative agents for CRC. The third-generation angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) Olmesartin Medoxomil is the most commonly prescribed medication in the US for the treatment of hypertension. ARBs and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have been shown to reduce inflammation and inhibit cell growth and survival, and several retrospective case-control studies have revealed an association between the use of these drugs and a reduced risk for several different types of cancer, including CRC. In addition, the angiotensin signaling inhibitors, Captopril and Telmisartan, have been shown to suppress the formation of colonic aberrant crypt foci in animal models of CRC. The known safety profiles, cardiovascular protective properties, and pre-clinical efficacy of ARBs and ACE inhibitors make them attractive candidates for CRC chemopreventative agents. The purpose of this Task Order is to evaluate Olmesartin Medoxomil for CRC prevention."

9545270,"RNA-based vaccines and therapeutics have emerged as great promise for HIV prevention and treatment, respectively. However, many obstacles still need to be overcome, in particular RNA instability, manufacturing problems, and clinically relevant delivery mechanisms of RNA into target cells. RNA vaccine approaches have some advantages in relation to other vaccine technologies; they can be delivered directly into the cytoplasm and do not require nuclear localization to generate expression. Improvements of methods for mRNA synthesis and stabilization and development of improved self-amplifying RNAs have recently yielded promising results. RNA approaches also stimulate the host?s innate defense system, in part through activation of the TLR pathways that recognize single and double stranded RNAs. Furthermore, RNA-based therapeutics have shown the potential to silence HIV effectively upon direct transfection in vitro, but delivery into cells in vivo is still unsatisfactory. Vector-based (lentivirus, adeno-associated virus) delivery to quiescent cells has proven inefficient, and the vectors themselves pose a risk to the host. The primary goal of this contract solicitation is to develop improved platform technologies for the delivery of RNA into specific cells and tissues to improve the efficacy of HIV vaccines or therapeutics. Examples of HIV RNA vaccines include, but are not limited to mRNA and self-amplifying RNAs. Examples of RNA therapeutics include small interfering RNA (siRNA), microRNA (miRNA), microRNA antagonists, aptamers, messenger RNA (mRNA), splice-switching oligonucleotides, antisense oligonucleotides, and plasmid or other circular DNAs encoding messenger RNAs and transcription regulatory sequences. To enhance the efficacy of traditional HIV vaccines and therapeutics, combinations of cytokines, adjuvants, broadly neutralizing monoclonal antibodies, immune checkpoint inhibitors, etc. can also be co-delivered in mRNA form. The short-term goal of this project is to perform feasibility studies for the development and use of delivery mechanisms for RNA-based HIV vaccines and therapies. The long-term goal of this project is to enable a small business to bring fully developed delivery systems for RNA-based HIV vaccines and therapies to the clinic and eventually to the market."
9569759,"The Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) Study was initiated in 1985 with two components: community-based surveillance and a prospective cohort study. The community surveillance aimed to monitor trends in hospitalized myocardial infarction (MI), fatal coronary heart disease (CHD) in four U.S. communities: Forsyth County, NC; Jackson, MS; suburbs of Minneapolis, MN; and Washington County, MD. Surveillance for hospitalized heart failure (HF) events was added in 2005. The communities were selected to provide data across four (4) geographic locations with a range of mortality rates, in urban, suburban, and rural settings. The cohort study aimed to investigate the risk factors for and natural history of atherosclerosis and development of clinical atherosclerosis in middle-aged white or African American adults from the same communities. The study recruited in 15,792 white or African American participants initially aged 45-64 years and selected participants received triennial clinical exams over the first ten years of the study (1987-1989, 1990-1992, 1993-1995, and 1996-1998), with a fifth clinical exam in 2011-2013, providing a rich set of data on physical, behavioral, genetic, and psychosocial factors. Since 1988, the cohort has been contacted annually and in 2011 semiannual follow-up was initiated. Findings have been presented in over 1,400 publications as of 2014.

9444063,"Project Summary Binge-eating is characterized by recurrent episodes of eating large amounts of foods, eating much more rapidly than normal and until feeling uncomfortably full, as well as feeling disgusted with oneself, depressed, or guilty after those episodes. Two eating disorders are characterized by binge-eating as central diagnostic criteria, bulimia nervosa (BN) and binge eating disorder (BED). Behavior studies have shown that negative affect and negative urgency (the tendency to act rashly when distressed) often drive binge-eating. A knowledge gap exists for 1) what neurobiological underpinnings are associated with negative affect that leads to loss of control and drives binge-eating, 2) whether neurotransmitter related brain circuits can be specifically linked to binge-eating, and 3) whether brain imaging can identify a brain based vulnerability for negative affect and excessive food intake in the natural environment. This application will study binge-eating across diagnostic categories, in individuals at normal weight with BN and obese individuals with BED, in contrast with normal weight or obese controls. We will apply the constructs cognitive control and positive valence system from NIMH's Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) project together with functional magnetic resonance brain imaging. In Aim 1. we will test whether negative affect alters brain reinforcement learning during a dopamine anchored taste reward paradigm. In Aim 2. we will study during a food choice paradigm the effects of negative affect on brain circuitry for cognitive control and food valuation. Aim 3. is to test whether brain activation predicts food intake or negative affect in a person's naturalistic environment, using ecological momentary assessment and meal observation. Binge-eating associated disorders are major health concerns with reduced quality of life and increased mortality rate, and the available treatments are limited. The neurobiology underlying binge-eating is not well understood and has not specifically been studied in a transdiagnostic approach using the NIMH's research domain criteria. This project will bridge affective-cognitive research knowledge with neurobiological brain research across eating disorders characterized by binge-eating as primary symptom. It will fill an important research and knowledge gap to develop intervention-directed research in the future."

9467405,"The rising prevalence of obesity in the U.S. over the past several decades and the accompanying spread of adverse long-ranging health effects pose serious public health and economic consequences. While a genetic contribution to obesity is well-established, genetic factors underlying individual susceptibility to common obesity have modest effects, which can be amplified considerably in the presence of certain triggering environmental factors. Approximately two-thirds of women of reproductive age now enter pregnancy at a high body mass index, and the majority of women experience pregnancy-associated weight gains in excess of Institute of Medicine guidelines, leading to increased perinatal and chronic health risks for both mother and child. The increased prevalence of obesity among women of reproductive age is reflected in a concomitant increase in the prevalence of gestational diabetes (GDM), which confers additional increased risk of adverse maternal and child health outcomes. Limited previous intervention research has indicated modest improvement in short-term maternal diet and gestational weight gain, with little evidence of long-term adherence. The well-documented inadequacies of these and traditional weight-loss interventions relying on existing health behavior paradigms suggest the need for innovations that allow for a shift in the theoretical framework underlying the determinants of eating behavior. Recent findings from basic research in neuroscience suggest that the brain reward response to highly palatable foods is a critical element that is currently absent in current theoretical frameworks. Individuals vary with respect to their ?food reward responsivity?, which refers to susceptibility to the effects of food and eating on the brain reward system. Simultaneously, foods vary with respect to their ?reinforcement value?, which refers to the degree to which foods activate the brain reward system. Whereas certain foods elicit a normative food reward response that is sensitive to homeostatic regulation of appetite, it is hypothesized that ?hyperpalatable? foods, which elicit exceptionally pronounced activation of the brain reward system, may blunt this sensitivity, leading to hedonic, non-homeostatic overeating characterized by food intake beyond energetic needs. Repeated consumption of hyperpalatable foods reinforces the brain food reward response and culminates in neurological changes similar to those observed with drugs of abuse. However, this rapidly-expanding body of work has not yet been incorporated into population-based research. Research to date on food reward responsivity and food reinforcement value has been conducted primarily in small samples in the general population. However, to date, no studies have examined these constructs among pregnant women. While it is known that most women gain more weight than recommended and many do not return to their pre-pregnancy weight, there is insufficient data on individual determinants of dietary intake and weight change during and after pregnancy. Understanding the association of food reward responsivity and food reinforcement value with dietary intake and weight change during pregnancy and postpartum may be informative for the development of clinical and public health interventions that promote optimal diet and weight in this population."

9430249,"Identifying abnormal fetal growth as restriction or overgrowth during an ongoing pregnancy remains a pressing clinical challenge. One promising area of research suggests that changes in fetal soft tissue, including lean mass, fat mass, and organ size, may be the earliest changes that occur in pathologic growth and that soft tissue measures may complement traditional estimates that are based primarily on bone dimensions. Three-dimensional volume assessment of a portion of the arm or thigh where the borders are easier to trace, known as fractional limb volumes, may also detect abnormalities in soft tissue that result from pathologic growth earlier than conventional 2D measures. Despite the fact that most standard ultrasound machines in the U.S. have 3D/4D capability, the available technology has not been widely integrated into routine clinical practice other than for evaluation of fetal malformations. It remains to be determined whether 3D significantly improves prenatal diagnosis over 2D and is worth the extra time and cost. The Government recently completed a multi-site, prospective cohort study, the NICHD Fetal Growth Studies, which was designed to establish a standard for normal fetal growth (velocity) and size for gestational age in the U.S. population, and to improve estimation of abnormal fetal growth for four self-identified race/ethnicity backgrounds in 2,334 low-risk, non-obese gravidas: African American (n=611), Asian (n=460), Caucasian (n=614), and Hispanic (n= 649). Following a detailed sonogram at 10-13 weeks of gestation, each woman was randomized to one of 4 follow-up visit schedules. Each schedule comprised 5 additional sonograms: (16-22, 24-29, 30-33, 34-37 and 38-41 gestational weeks) for fetal biometry plus additional image and 3D volume acquisition for later analysis. An additional 486 obese women were recruited as well as 171 women with dichorionic twin gestations (where each twin has its own chorionic and amniotic sacs). The twin protocol was similar to the singleton protocol, with slight differences undertaken to allow the research ultrasounds to report to the clinical side, recognizing the high risk status of twin pregnancies, and a simplified ultrasound protocol to limit ultrasound time and patient burden. In addition to traditional biometrics, the following volumes were collected in the singleton study if they were able to be obtained: 1st trimester: fetus and gestational sac; 2nd and 3rd trimesters: head, cerebellum, face, chest, heart, abdomen, pelvis, arm and thigh. In twins, the volumes collected were 1st trimester: fetus and gestational sac and in the 2nd and 3rd trimesters the thigh. In addition to body composition, fetal cerebellar and organ sizes may differ in fetuses with growth abnormalities. Fetal cerebellar volumes have been suggested as potentially having better discrimination for fetal growth restriction than one measurement in a 2-D plane. However, there are very few studies on fetal cerebellar volumes. In addition, there may be racial differences, as cerebellar volumes were different in a Taiwan population compared to a Brazilian population. Whether cerebellar volumes vary by pregnancy complication is unknown. Kidney and liver volumes have been studied in association with pregnancy conditions such as small-for-gestational age (SGA) and gestational diabetes. In summary, there is a paucity of data on longitudinal changes in fetal body composition (subcutaneous fat, lean mass) and visceral volumes over the course of pregnancy. This data gaps contrasts sharply with available imaging technology. Knowledge of fetal body composition has the potential for practical scientific and clinical use given that current management of many pregnancy complications is limited because the degree of severity that results in adverse outcomes remains uncertain. Moreover, given reported differences in birth size characteristics by maternal race, we will be able to use data from a prospective pregnancy cohort design with longitudinal measurements (2D and 3D) to assess body composition changes and visceral measurements for the 4 maternal racial groups. Future interventions can also be tested such as increasing periods of maternal rest to increase blood flow to the uterus in instances of decreasing fetal fat deposition as an early signal for fetal growth restriction. The NICHD Fetal Growth Study is an ideal, prospective epidemiologic study well-designed to characterize fetal body composition and organ sizes. Knowledge of these associations could help increase understanding of the etiology of fetal and subsequent neonatal morbidity, and guide future interventions such as improved maternal disease control, individualized pregnancy monitoring and determining timing of delivery."

9581128,"Over the last few years, protocols have been established to develop the ?next generation? of cancer models, in vitro propagating cultures that can be verified to more closely represent the tumor from which they originated. Several groups have demonstrated that organoid cultures and conditionally reprogrammed cells in combination with unique media formulations offer new tools to address current gaps in our understanding of cancer initiation, development, and progression.   Systematic application of these novel culture methods now present an opportunity to develop a large library of cancer models that can be made available as a community resource to investigators in academia and the biopharmaceutical industry. In response to the opportunity, the National Cancer Institute?s (NCI) Office of Cancer Genomics (OCG), in the Center for Cancer Genomics (CCG), together with international institutions, has established a consortium, the Human Cancer Models Initiative (HCMI). HCMI?s goal is to make available to the scientific community large numbers of ?next generation? in vitro cancer models that are not encumbered with excessive intellectual property (IP) constraints.  To support the US contribution to HCMI, OCG established two Cancer Model Development Centers (CMDC) to develop the ?next generation? models using high-throughput, systematic techniques. The CMDC sites have established relationships with their own network of clinical sites at which cancer patients will be consented and enrolled to donate their medical data and tissues.  Eventually, successfully developed models will be made available via a third-party distributor, and the case-specific clinical and molecular characterization data will be made available through CCG?s Genomic Data Commons (GDC, https://gdc.nci.nih.gov/index.html)."

9424863,"PROJECT SUMMARY Infertility is a common condition affecting as many as 15% of couples in the United States. Despite its prevalence, little is known about the determinants of infertility overall, or on modifiable risk factors for the male and female contributions to infertility. Male factors (commonly defined clinically as abnormalities in conventional semen quality parameters) are implicated in as many as 58% of cases, with an additional one third of cases attributed to both male and female factors. Genetics have been shown to account for a small percent (10-15%) of male infertility, indicating that lifestyle factors and environmental exposures likely play a vital role in the majority of male factor infertility cases. Compelling animal and human studies have linked exposures to air pollution with altered semen quality. A recent review and a recent meta-analysis of the human epidemiologic data both concluded that air pollution has been associated with various measures of semen quality, but both pointed to issues of comparability, consistency, and quality in the existing literature. Concerns have also been raised regarding the impacts of environmental exposures to endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs), including phthalates, flame retardants, pesticides, volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) as well as the implications of exposures to multiple chemicals simultaneously. Although the results of this literature are compelling, a number of important research gaps remain. To date, no study has comprehensively examined the impact of multiple environmental exposures from a wide variety of sources among groups of young, otherwise healthy men, and little is known regarding the potential epigenetic changes these exposures may make to spermatozoa that may lead to adverse health effects in later generations. Our proposed study will address a number of these limitations, while taking advantage of newly available mobile monitoring devices, novel outcome measurement techniques, and newly developed real-time exposure monitoring and passive personal samplers to improve exposure assessment. We will leverage these combined technologies in the Growing Up Today Study (GUTS), a prospective nationwide cohort of young adults followed since early childhood. Ambient and in-home measures of air pollution will be assigned throughout spermatogenesis and personal exposures to a wide range of EDCs will be assessed with personal passive wristbands. We will assess the impact of multiple environmental exposures on measures of semen quality (concentration, total count, and motility) assessed via cell phone, morphology assessed with standard laboratory methods, and novel epigenomic markers (sperm DNA methylation). Specifically we will evaluate the associations of ambient and indoor home exposures to PM2.5 and NO2 and personal measurements of EDCs on semen quality (concentration, count, morphology, and motility) and assess the association of these exposures on sperm DNA methylation patterns."

9568097,"The goal of newborn screening is to detect potentially fatal or disabling conditions in newborns, thereby providing a window of opportunity for early treatment, often while the child is still asymptomatic. Such early detection and treatment can have a profound impact on the clinical severity of the condition in the affected child. If left undiagnosed and untreated, the consequences of the targeted disorders can be dire, many causing irreversible neurological damage, intellectual, developmental and physical disabilities, and even death. In 2006, the American College of Medical Genetics (ACMG) developed newborn screening guidelines that recommend that all newborn infants be screened for 29 core conditions and that 26 secondary conditions identified during the core evaluations be reported. These recommendations have been accepted by the HHS Secretary's Advisory Committee on Heritable Disorders in Newborns and Children (ACHDNC) (authorized by the Children's Health Act of 2000), and by the Secretary of HHS. Since acceptance of the core conditions, 5 additional ones have been added. Most states now use this or very similar panels for newborn screening. Currently, there are thousands of rare disorders that have been identified and hundreds that could potentially benefit from newborn screening."
9403207,"The centromere inheritance paradox is that although centromeres control genetic inheritance by directing chromosome segregation, centromeres themselves are not encoded by a particular DNA sequence. Instead, centromeres are defined epigenetically by the presence of nucleosomes containing the histone H3 variant CENP-A. That a protein is the mark poses a problem for maintaining centromere identity during oocyte development because oocytes arrest in prophase I for years or decades (in humans) before resuming the cell cycle to complete meiosis. In cycling somatic cells, CENP-A partitions between sister chromatids during DNA replication and reloads in early G1 phase, which maintains CENP-A levels between cell cycles. These mechanisms do not explain how centromere identity is maintained in the oocyte because there is no known mechanism to assemble new CENP-A nucleosomes according to the established paradigm for loading in G1. Oocytes are unique in that they arrest in prophase I, and then centromeres must be maintained until the cell cycle resumes in response to hormonal stimuli. In principle, two factors could contribute to maintain centromere identity: (1) the intrinsic stability of CENP-A nucleosomes and (2) a possible prophase I loading mechanism to replace CENP-A that is lost with age. Our preliminary data show that both make significant contributions. Aim 1 will define CENP-A stability over the reproductive lifespan of the animal, determine the mechanism of loading during prophase I, and determine the functional significance of this loading mechanism. Our previous biophysical and structural studies showed that CENP-A nucleosomes are ~10-fold more rigid than their canonical H3 counterparts. Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that structural rigidity of CENP-A underlies its long-term stability and centromere inheritance in the oocyte. We will identify point mutations that compromise structural rigidity and stability but localize normally and support centromere function in cycling somatic cells. We will also generate knock-in animals of selected mutants to test the functional consequences of reduced stability for maintaining centromere identity and function in oocytes. Overall, our experiments will provide the first insight into mechanisms underlying centromere inheritance in the mammalian female germline, and connect atomic level structural insights to long-term maintenance of centromere identity and ultimately reproductive fitness. Our approach is highly interdisciplinary, combining structural biology and biophysics with in vivo reproductive biology, to gain insight into how oocytes maintain structures assembled during entry into meiotic prophase I that must then function years or decades later during oocyte maturation. Such understanding has clear health implications given the decline in fertility associated with increasing maternal age and women delaying the time of childbirth."

9536615,"In 2000, the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) awarded contracts to conduct a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in young children with sickle cell disease (SCD) to test the hypothesis that Hydroxyurea (HU) can prevent the onset of chronic end organ damage in children recruited before two years of age. Contracts were awarded to ten Clinical Centers to recruit, enroll, and follow patients to monitor clinical responsiveness to study treatments, to assess growth and development, and to monitor for toxicity from study treatments. Surrogate markers of end organ damage were used to evaluate pulmonary, renal, splenic, and brain function as well as developmental milestones. One Medical Coordinating Center was awarded to oversee drug distribution, coordinate central laboratory functions, perform data collection and analysis, and conduct clinical sites visits to monitor study performance. The trial enrolled 193 subjects with SCD between the ages of 9 and 17 months from October 2003 to June 2007. Subjects remained on study drug for a period of two years. HU demonstrated substantial clinical benefit without serious toxicity in this cohort of very young children. In 2008, a follow-up study was added to the contracts to provide structured follow-up of the children after they completed their two years on study drug. The purpose of the initial Follow-Up Study is to characterize the long-term toxicities and unexpected risks (if any) associated with treatment with HU at an early age. Information obtained from this follow-up study is vitally important to understanding the risks and benefits of early treatment, and ultimately for creation of an optimal paradigm for HU therapy in young children with sickle cell anemia. The follow-up study ends in December 2011. The purpose of the Baby Hug Follow-Up Study II is to provide continued structured follow-up of the children enrolled in the Baby Hug Follow-Up Study I, to characterize the long-term toxicities and unexpected risks (if any) associated with HU treatment at an early age, and to determine if there are clinical benefits from the treatments. Collection and ongoing evaluation of growth and development and clinical data are crucial for determination of the long-term effects of HU. The objective is to intensively monitor and assess this unique group of children for growth, development, and clinical status at least through the first decade of life to document any alterations in the natural history of sickle cell disease associated with early HU therapy. The follow-up will include enhanced neuropsychological, brain, cardiac, and pulmonary evaluations. All children enrolled will be followed to a common termination date of December 31, 2016. Results from the Follow-up Study II will improve understanding of the natural history of SCD in young children and in a cohort receiving HU. Whether or not HU reduces organ damage in these children will be established. If HU has a beneficial effect, the standard of care for children with SCD will be permanently altered."

9566454,"Endometrial hyperplasia (EH), a pre-cancerous condition of excessive proliferation of the endometrium, generally arises in the context of chronic estrogen exposure unopposed by progesterone. It represents a continuum of histologically distinct processes, starting from simple EH without atypia that progresses to complex EH without atypia, followed by complex EH with atypia. The presence of the most severe form of EH (complex EH with atypia) in an endometrial biopsy denotes a high (29%-52%) risk of concurrent and future endometrial cancer (EC). Current treatment approaches for EH are limited, involving primarily hysterectomy or hormone therapy. Growing evidence has shown progressive increases in cyclin D1 expression in human endometrial glands with complex hyperplasia and in endometrioid adenocarcinoma, compared with healthy human endometrium tissue. SHetA2 is a nontoxic, orally bioavailable drug that causes cyclin D1 degradation and G1 cell cycle arrest in transformed cells. SHetA2 also induces decreases in cyclin D1 in uterine tissues from mice treated with oral or vaginal suppository administration, compared with control mice. Furthermore, SHetA2 selectively triggers apoptosis in tumor cells by inhibiting migration of the chaperone GRP75 and its client proteins (such as the ER) to the mitochondria.

9430051,"This project is a major part of the Developmental Therapeutics Program drug discovery and development program within the Division of Cancer Treatment and Diagnosis. The emphasis is on preclinical drug discovery and preclinical drug development.  In Vitro Cancer Cell Line Screen (IVCCLS) ? During FY2007, the cell-line screen added a 60thth tumor cell line, MDA-MB-468, for evaluation of the antitumor activity of both natural and synthetic agents. The screen includes cell lines that represent a variety of cancers, including leukemia, melanoma, and cancers of the lung, colon, brain, ovary, breast, prostate, and kidney. The aim is to prioritize, for further evaluation, synthetic compounds or natural product samples showing selective growth inhibition or cell killing of particular tumor cell lines. The primary screening paradigm was changed to incorporate an initial single drug-dose screen against all 60 cell lines in the screen. Drugs that show activity in the one-dose assay are retested in the standard assay that consists of a 5-concentration test using the 60 human tumor cell lines. The criteria used to identify active agents was developed based on historical data from the 5-dose screen and developed to establish a targeted pass rate of 20?25% and to capture the majority of drugs that have previously been shown to be active in the standard screen. The concept of the one-dose screen is to more rapidly identify active drugs and eliminate inactive compounds so resources can be focused on the active compounds. The 60-cell line screen is unique in that the complexity of a 60-cell line dose response produced by a given compound results in a biological response pattern that can be utilized in pattern recognition algorithms. Using these programs, it is possible to assign a putative mechanism of action to a test compound, or to determine that the response pattern is unique and not similar to that of any of the standard prototype compounds included in the NCI database. In addition, following characterization of various cellular molecular targets in the cell lines, it is possible to select compounds most likely to interact with a specific target.  In Vitro Molecular Targets Screening Program (MTSP) - The In Vitro Molecular Target Screening Program (MTSP) is a dedicated service providing direct support to the DCTD/DTP anticancer drug discovery program. This laboratory has developed the infrastructure and expertise for the operation of cell-free and cell-based high-throughput (HTS) molecular target-based assays. MTSP has developed the staff experience, instrumentation, and information technology infrastructure to carry out screening campaigns with large chemical libraries (>140,000 compounds). Several HTS screening campaigns have been completed and others are ongoing at the present time. In addition, MTSP has gained enhanced molecular biology experience by developing new methods for the transfection of human tumor cells with molecular target genes of interest and by optimizing expression systems for recombinant proteins to be utilized as reagents for our HTS molecular target screens. To complement these primary screens, the laboratory has developed assays for secondary testing of compounds showing activity in various HTS screens."

9573644,"The Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) has a mission to develop safe and effective contraceptives for women, including obese women. Obesity is the number one public health issue facing the US population and is an independent risk for venous thromboembolism (VTE). Therefore, there is a public health need to develop effective contraception for woman that does not increase the risk of VTE. One Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved contraceptive method is the progestin-only pill (POP). This method requires strict adherence to taking the POP at the same time every day. The method is associated with irregular bleeding which often leads to discontinuation of the method. Daily low dose oral progesterone receptor modulators (PR.WlS) , such as UPA, have been shown to inhibit ovulation and cause amenorrhea. The endogenous estrogen level is not affected by the PRM. Thus, the method will provide a regimen that is easier to follow than a POP regimen and have a theoretically lower risk of VTE, especially for obese women. In addition, there is in vitro evidence that UP A may have protective activity against breast cancer. In order to provide preliminary evidence that daily, low dose UP A could be effective for contraception, a clinical trial will be conducted in the NICHD Contraceptive Clinical Trials Network (CCTN). The proposed study will be evaluated sequentially. Initially, women of reproductive age, with normal menstrual cycles, will receive treatment for 12 weeks (three 28-day cycles) in order to evaluate the mechanisms of contraceptive efficacy, safety and acceptability of this new contraceptive. Subjects will be randomized into 3 arms:  ? Group 1: UP A 5 mg taken orally daily for 24 days followed by a pill-free interval of 4 days, repeated 3 times. ? Group 2: UP A 10 mg taken orally daily for 84 days (12 weeks) without interruption. ? Group 3: UPA 5 mg taken orally daily for 84 days (12 weeks) without interruption."
9581257,"Summary  New treatments are needed for severe asthmatics who do not respond to standard therapy with inhaled steroids, especially those with a ?type 2 low? phenotype, such as individuals with neutrophil-predominant inflammation. This solicitation is for the development and early commercialization of an inhalational formulation of the 5A apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I) mimetic peptide that can be administered to asthmatic subjects in Phase I clinical trials and subsequently developed into a new treatment for severe asthma.   ApoA-I is the major protein component of high-density lipoproteins, which mediates reverse cholesterol transport out of cells by interacting with the ATP-binding cassette subfamily member 1 (ABCA1). ApoA-I also has anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant, and immunomodulatory properties. NHLBI investigators have shown that systemic administration of the 5A apoA-I mimetic peptide, which is a bi-helical peptide that recapitulates the ?-helical structure of apoA-I and mediates reverse cholesterol transport out of cells by interacting with ABCA1, attenuates the induction of airway inflammation, mucous cell metaplasia, and airway hyperresponsiveness in house dust mite (HDM)-challenged mice. In addition, they have shown that apoA-I has a protective effect in allergic asthma. Apoa1-knockout mice, which were sensitized and challenged with ovalbumin (OVA), have increased neutrophilic airway inflammation that was primarily mediated by increased G-CSF expression, with associated increases in type 1 (IFN-?, TNF-?) and Th17 (IL-17A) cytokines. The increased neutrophilic airway inflammation in the OVA-challenged Apoa1-knockout mice was inhibited by intranasal administration of the 5A apoA-I mimetic peptide. Lastly, serum apoA-I levels are positively correlated with FEV1 in atopic asthmatic subjects, which suggests that circulating apoA-I may improve airflow obstruction. These murine and human translational studies serve as the conceptual basis for developing the 5A apoA-I mimetic peptide into a novel inhalational treatment for severe asthma.  Project Goals  The overall goal of this project is to prepare, in both manufacturing processes and preclinical evaluation, an inhalational 5A apoA-I mimetic peptide that will be the subject of a future Investigational New Drug (IND) application to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) focused on the treatment of type 2 low phenotype asthma patients, such as those with neutrophil-predominant inflammation. Successful submission and allowance to proceed of the IND will enable the company to collaborate on the conduct of a clinical trial with intramural clinicians at the NIH Clinical Center, at the company?s discretion. During review, preference will be given to companies or teams with a demonstrated prior ability to successfully bring either a peptide therapeutic or an inhalational therapeutic to, at a minimum, Phase 1 clinical studies in the US."

9591102,"?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The continued emergence of bacterial strains that are resistant to multiple broad classes of antibiotics has raised significant concern among the medical community, some even suggesting we may be about to enter a post-antibiotic era. Among resistant bacteria, carbapenemase-producing members of the Enterobacteriaceae, particularly Klebsiella pneumoniae carrying the blaKPC allele, are agents of major concern. Bacteriophages, viruses that infect bacteria, have been proposed as biological control agents for the treatment of these MDR bacterial infections. Phages have the advantages of being specific, non-toxic and capable of growing at the site of the bacterial infection, and have been shown to cure a wide variety of bacterial infections in animal model studies. However, little is understood regarding the principles of in vivo phage efficacy. The work proposed in this project will assemble a well-characterized library of lytic phages capable of killing KPC+ K. pneumoniae isolates, and develop mouse and rabbit models of asymptomatic KPC+ K. pneumoniae carriage and gut-derived bacteremia caused by KPC+ K. pneumoniae. The host ranges, resistance profiles, growth characteristics and in vivo performance of the phages in the library will be used to assemble a mixture of phages with maximal efficacy against a broad swath of clinically relevant KPC+ K. pneumoniae strains, and these will be evaluated in mouse and rabbit models of infection developed for this study. This work will produce a phage-based therapeutic that will have a direct application for treatment of KPC+ K. pneumoniae infection in humans, and will determine some of the phage parameters associated with in vivo efficacy."

9430057,"Accession of Clinically Annotated Pathology Specimens for Molecular Marker Research - Large numbers of clinically annotated specimens are required for the evaluation of markers and assays for clinical decision-making, but it is generally not possible to anticipate the specific needs of the research community. It is very costly to set up specimen banks for all the different possible needs. The Cancer Diagnosis Program (CDP) seeks to test a peer-to-peer informatics system to locate and retrieve specimens and pertinent clinical and outcome data on an as needed (just-in-time) basis from community health care settings. A system exists that has been shown to work in an academic setting, but much larger numbers of specimens are housed in the community setting. In addition Health Maintenance Organizations generally have both inpatient and outpatient records, and this can provide more complete treatment and recurrence information than that contained in tumor registries. CDP is supporting a program to develop and test an open-source, peer-to-peer computer program to identify pathologic specimens and associated clinical and outcome data in clinic and hospital settings. This program will be tested in 2-3 sites selected by CDP from members of the Cancer Research Network (funded by the NCI), in sites showing good quality, archived pathologic specimens suitable for molecular marker studies; and to have computerized medical record systems that are linked to the specimens. This program will initially test and adapt their previously developed de-identification protocol at the local sites, evaluating its performance on ever larger numbers of cases. Test retrieval queries will be constructed to include the identification of specimens from pathology reports and linkage to local clinical and outcome databases. Successive queries will be increasingly complex, including as many such databases as possible. Evaluation of the query results will be by manual inspection of data and pathology blocks using study and local personnel as appropriate.  Tissue Microarrays - The Cancer Diagnosis Program (CDP) supports construction of statistically designed Tissue Microarrays (TMAs) using breast cancer tissue and clinical data. The TMAs will be used by breast cancer investigators to develop and validate prognostic and predictive diagnostic biomarkers. Archival, well annotated invasive breast carcinoma and DCIS pathology cases from the patient population in diverse geographic areas with 5-10 years of clinical follow data will be used for designing prognostic and progression TMAs with built in statistical significance. Clinical and outcome data fields associated with each case (patient) include: histological diagnosis, demographic data, extent of disease, treatment, follow-up, recurrence, survival and vital status. Each TMA requires several hundred breast cancer cases and needs to be selected from a much larger collection to avoid biases. Board certified pathologists need to select pathology blocks, cut slides from the blocks, perform QA/QC and mark the appropriate areas on the slides for coring and construction of the TMAs. Significant QA/QC also needs to be performed to assure that the clinical data associated with the specimens used in the TMAs is complete and accurate. The end results of this effort will be the delivery of quality assured tumor blocks with marked slides and complete and accurate data.  Calibration of the BCR-ABL Assay for CML - The Cancer Diagnosis Program (CDP) supports the development and evaluation of molecular diagnostics for clinical practice. Acceptance by clinicians of the BCR-ABL assay for Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia (CML) is limited by the lack of standardization among the American laboratories that perform the assay. The assay uses quantitative RT-PCR, and despite being performed in CLIA-certified laboratories, one laboratory's results cannot be directly compared to anothers. Currently many American laboratories perform this assay using different protocols and different control genes. There are no commonly used calibrators to standardize the assay. The CDP is supporting this project to assess whether use of a uniform RNA calibrator improves standardization of this assay. The study sites must have a CLIA-certified laboratory that routinely performs the BCR-ABL assay according to their CLIA certified laboratory procedures and protocols, and the NCI will provide specially prepared samples including some duplicates and will provide calibrators."

9588372,"PROJECT SUMMARY The development of alcohol use disorders involves a transition to inflexible habitual drug-seeking behavior, resulting in difficulty regulating or terminating drinking behavior. Ethanol exposure is thought to facilitate the expression of habitual ethanol seeking, and indeed our own data indicate that chronic intermittent ethanol exposure (CIE) promotes the expression of this behavior. A growing body of literature suggests that glutamatergic signaling within corticostriatal circuits is dysregulated across chronic ethanol exposure. In particular, data suggest that CIE increases extracellular glutamate in the nucleus accumbens shell (NAcS), and that this effect may be mediated by the loss of presynaptic mGluR2. Despite strong evidence that glutamate signaling within these circuits mediates behavioral flexibility, little is known regarding how NAcS glutamate signaling changes across the development of inflexible reward seeking, and further, how alterations in NAcS glutamate signaling can regulate the expression of actions versus habits. This K99/R00 proposal contains a comprehensive training and research plan based on the applicant?s preliminary findings that regulation of glutamate signaling within the NAcS can reverse CIE-induced deficits in goal-directed behavior, directly implicating NAcS glutamate signaling in response strategy selection. During the mentored portion of the award, the applicant will receive training in cutting-edge laboratory techniques including multielectrode array (MEA) recording in awake behaving mice, pharmacogenetics and optogenetics. The candidate will use this training to test the novel hypothesis that alterations in NAcS glutamate signaling resulting from CIE exposure impair behavioral flexibility. Aim 1 is designed to confirm the hypothesis that CIE-induced deficits in goal-directed ethanol seeking can be reversed by mGluR2/3 agonism and to confirm the neuroanatomical locus of this effect. In Aim 2 we will use MEA recordings to test the hypothesis that acquisition of habitual behavior is accompanied by changes in neuronal activity in the NAcS, as well as synchrony between the NAcS and structures that send glutamatergic projections to this brain region, including the infralimbic prefrontal cortex (IfL), the basolateral amygdala (BLA) and the ventral hippocampus (VH). Aim 3 is designed to test the hypothesis that pharmacogenetic and optogenetic manipulations of activity within distinct glutamatergic projections to the NAcS ? from the IfL, BLA and VH - alter the expression of habitual ethanol seeking. The results of these experiments are expected to provide considerable information on the neurobiology of habitual ethanol seeking and to identify mechanisms through which behavioral flexibility can be restored. We expect that the knowledge gained from these studies will provide significant insight into the development of alcohol use disorders that will ultimately inform the generation of novel prevention and treatment strategies. The training that the candidate receives during the mentored portion of this award is expected to facilitate her career development and transition toward becoming an independent neuroscientist."
9566457,"Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) makes up about 20% of all breast cancers (BCs), and the majority of BCs associated with BRCA1 mutations. The fact that TNBCs are more aggressive with poorer prognoses and no targeted therapies places them in the forefront of cancers requiring targeted preventive and treatment pharmaceutical intervention.  TNBCs exhibit a high incidence of TP53 mutations (>80%), loss of RB expression (20%) and PI3KCA mutations (7-9%).  Activation of the Wnt/?-catenin pathway is common in TNBCs and the related basal-like BCs. Autocrine feed-forward stimulation by Wnt ligands may underlie this Wnt pathway hyperactivation.  When Wnt is activated by its ligand, it binds to the transmembrane receptor frizzled (FZD) which, in turn, recruits Disheveled (DVL). This leads to phosphorylation of the tail of transmembrane LRP5/6 by CK1?, all of which results in disassembling of the ?-catenin destruction complex.  The now stabilized ?-catenin translocates to the nucleus where it induces transcription of target genes in the Wnt pathway. The phosphorylation of LRP5/6, and probably DVL, by CK1? (and CK1?) thus plays a role in carcinogenic progression via Wnt pathway activation, but also via other pathways. Multiple attempts have been made to develop agents that inhibit serine/threonine kinases such as CK1?/?, but most exhibit disadvantages, including lack of specificity.  In contrast, the dual CK1?/CK1? inhibitor SR-3029 is one of 2 compounds that do exhibit the desired specificity and it inhibits TNBC tumor growth in vitro and in vivo (human breast cancer cell lines; xenografts and patient-derived xenografts derived from TNBCs in immunosuppressed hosts).  Furthermore, CK1? is overexpressed and amplified in 36% of breast cancers, regardless of intrinsic subtype.  CK1? is also overexpressed in multiple breast cancer cell lines, including TNBC, HER2+ cell lines, but not ER+ cell lines. SR-3029 shows selective inhibition of in vitro and in vivo growth of cell lines that overexpress CK1?.  In sum, hyperactivation of the Wnt/?-catenin pathway is a hallmark of breast tumors that overexpress CK1?, in turn making such tumors likely to be vulnerable to inhibition by SR-3029. The overall objective of this task order is to test the efficacy of SR-3029 in prevention of breast cancers that occur in association with inherited BRCA1 mutations and cancers that show hyperactivation of the Wnt pathway."

9425609,"Project Summary/Abstract Localization of mRNAs to specific cells of an embryo, or to sub-cellular regions in the cell, enables spatially controlled protein production. Distinct concentrations of proteins lead to differential cell fate determination, body patterning, and cell function during development in many animals. Especially, this mechanism of localized translation appears essential in embryonic cells that are large and that undergo rapid cell divisions, requiring immediate input of specific protein without relying on diffusion kinetics from translation elsewhere in the cell. Indeed, the mitotic spindle is a sub-cellular region where localization of mRNAs has been reported in eggs/ embryos of various organisms. The mechanism or process of localized translation on the spindle has been, however, little identified. The proposed research focuses on a conserved DEAD-box RNA helicase Vasa that is localized on the spindle of every blastomere during embryogenesis. We previously identified Vasa functions in general translational regulation and its dysfunction results in ~80% reduction of protein synthesis and mitotic defects in the sea urchin embryo. We, therefore, hypothesize in these embryonic cells, Vasa contributes to the process of localized mRNA translation on the spindle. To test our hypothesis, using sea urchin embryos that show constant and robust Vasa expression on the spindle of every blastomere, we will visualize in vivo and in real time localized translation and validate how each mRNA/protein is differentially regulated at each sub-cellular region during embryogenesis. We will then identify sub-cellular function of Vasa by manipulating its localization in the cell using advanced imaging techniques such as optogenetics and Chromophore- Assisted Light Inactivation (CALI). A biological event of localized mRNA translation as well as a DEAD- box RNA-helicase Vasa is highly conserved among various organisms and cells. The outcomes of this project will be thus useful to all researchers, especially those who study how sub-cellular level of mRNA and protein regulation impacts cellular regulation and development in any cells and organisms."

9565898,"Pancreatic cancer is one of the most lethal cancers in both men and women. Because it is usually diagnosed at an advanced stage, the survival rate is extremely poor. While developing better therapeutic modality is key to improving the treatment outcome of patients diagnosed with pancreatic cancer, it is highly imperative to identify individuals at high risk of pancreatic cancer and provide active screening for early detection. Known risk factors for pancreatic cancer include cigarette smoking, obesity, chronic pancreatitis, diabetes, and family history of genetic syndromes associated with increased pancreatic cancer risk, including BRCA2 gene mutation, Lynch syndrome, familial atypical multiple mole melanoma syndrome (caused by mutations in p16/CDKN2A), Peutz-Jeghers syndrome, and Von Hippel-Lindau syndrome. While active screening and monitoring of high risk individuals should allow early detection of pre-invasive pancreatic lesions, effective interventional modalities to prevent progression of precursor lesions to pancreatic cancer are virtually non-existent, except for surgical resection, which is not always curative and can be associated with a significant risk of morbidity. Safe and effective preventive measures are urgently needed to reduce morbidity and mortality associated with this highly deadly disease.  Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is the most common type of pancreatic cancer and accounts for more than 85% of cases. More than 90% of PDAC are known to harbor mutationally activated KRAS (e.g. G12D). KRAS mutations are one of the earliest genetic alterations believed to drive pancreatic tumorigenesis and frequently detected in pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN), the most common precursor lesion of PDAC. Mutated oncogenic driver genes, such as KRAS, known to be involved in early tumorigenic process are ideal targets for preventive interventions. However, there are no small molecule agents targeting oncogenic KRAS presently available for clinical translation. Another approach to targeting oncogenic KRAS may be through boosting the host?s immune defense through vaccination. Recent advances in the understanding of immune regulatory mechanisms and the characteristics of innate and adaptive antitumor immune responses have uncovered the host immune system?s remarkable ability to counter tumor growth. When tumor-derived immune suppression is blocked by immune checkpoint inhibitors, the immune system can unleash more robust antitumor immune responses, leading to tumor clearance. Tumor antigens (TA) targeted by the host immune system can range from tumor-driving oncoproteins, tumor-associated mutant neo-antigens or self-antigens overexpressed in tumors. It is highly conceivable that if antitumor immunity can be elicited by TA-specific vaccines before or early in the tumorigenic process, the host may be able to mount more robust antitumor immunity and protect itself from emerging malignant tumors, as tumor-associated immunosuppressive mechanisms should have negligible effects on the host?s immune function.   A recent study carried out by Dr. Ming You from Medical College of Wisconsin in collaboration with the DCP PREVENT Program has identified novel KRAS peptides, which had 100% sequence identity to human KRAS and were found to promote Th1 immune responses in immune-competent mice.  Vaccination with a mixture of the immunogenic KRAS peptides conferred significant tumor preventive effects in a genetically engineered mouse model of mutant KRAS-driven lung tumorigenesis. It is highly conceivable that similar effects can be attained with the identified multipeptide KRAS vaccine in other KRAS-driven tumors such as pancreatic cancer. Given the high degree of homology between human and mouse KRAS, the KRAS vaccine holds a great potential for clinical translation in the prevention setting. The current study aims to examine the cancer preventive efficacy of the multipeptide KRAS vaccine and establish immune correlates of protection against KRAS-induced pancreatic cancer."

9568926,"The phenotype of a cancer cell---the set of observable behavioral characteristics including its aggressiveness or pathogenicity, its susceptibility to drug or radiation therapy, its metabolic profile, secreteome, and many other attributes---is not uniquely defined by it's genotype. Rather, it is an emergent property of a complex set of variables that involve chemical and mechanical microenvironmental cues, genetic perturbations, and the epigenetic state of the cell. While great volumes of research have focused on understanding the oncogenic role of each factor individually, compiling them into a holistic picture of cancer growth and progression remains a challenge. SimBioSys, Inc. is developing new computational technologies integrating metabolomic, transcriptomic, and imaging data, in order to construct in silico models of cancer metabolism within realistic spatially- and chemically-heterogeneous microenvironments. At the core of this technology is a novel technique that models the competition for and sharing of metabolites between cells of different types, and/or phenotypes (i.e. stem vs. differentiated, cancerous vs. healthy, etc.). Our intent is to develop a novel computational tool for biomedical researchers that integrates reaction-diffusion and metabolic modeling with large -omics and histology datasets to provide new insight into the behavior of cancers."

9573730,"During pregnancy, adverse events in the mother such as infection and pregnancy complications that result in immune responses have been linked with neuropsychiatric disorders in the offspring.  In addition, prenatal stressors have also been shown to drive immune responses during pregnancy with resulting adverse consequences for offspring.  Proinflammatory cytokines, or an imbalance between pro-and anti-inflammatory cytokines, are suggested as one of the underlying mechanisms that explain the association between these immune response events and children?s risk of neuropsychiatric disorders.  In order to investigate the association between fetal exposure to biomarkers of maternal immune activity throughout gestation and children?s neurocognitive development up to age 7 ages, we propose to use samples from the Collaborative Perinatal Project (CPP).  The CPP was conducted between 1959 and 1966 and designed to examine the relationships between perinatal events and neurological defects of the offspring in a total of 55,908 women across 12 hospitals.  Offspring were followed through age 7, with approximately 70% retention for the duration of the study.  Maternal serum was extracted from blood collected serially during pregnancy from the date of study registration through delivery and stored in the National Institutes of Health repositories at minus 20 degrees Celsius.  The Division of Intramural Population Health Research (DIPHR) has identified approximately 3,700 (3,697) serum specimens in the NICHD-DIPHR repository from CPP participations, from which assays of immune activity will be conducted.  Measurement of immunological markers from these specimens will allow investigation of the association between fetal exposure of biomarkers of maternal immune activity and the child?s neurocognitive development, and allow for investigation of these associations within specific pregnancy trimesters.  The task order is to use Q-PlexTM Human Cytokine HS screen (for 15 cytokines) and individual assays to detect IL-8, hsCRP, BDNF, and IL-1R1 antagonist from 2697 CPP serum samples."

9581860,"High Throughput Genotyping and DNA Sequencing for Studying the Genetic Contributions to Human Disease: Genetics of Dental Enamel Formation DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Inherited enamel malformations are caused by defects in genes essential for dental enamel formation and are grouped together under the collective designation of Amelogenesis Imperfecta, or AI. AI is a serious condition and may be associated with health problems in other parts of the body. AI patients are often self- conscious because of the disfiguring appearance of their teeth. They have lower self-esteem and perceive themselves as having an inferior quality of life. They avoid cold food and drinks. Some undergo extensive dental rehabilitation procedures, but the majorities simply suffer the effects of the disease. There are numerous forms of AI, each caused by defects in a different gene. In syndromic forms of AI, enamel malformations are accompanied by serious, sometimes hidden systemic problems, like blindness, kidney calcifications, immunodeficiency, or skin blistering. Isolated and syndromic forms of AI often cannot be distinguished clinically, so genetic testing that identifies the causative genetic defect would establish the diagnosis and discern whether or not other tissues or organs besides enamel are affected. Better understanding of the causes of AI provides hope for improvements in the diagnosis, assessment of prognosis, treatment, and cure of AI diseases. Some mutations cause synthesis of a protein to stop prematurely, which can potentially be treated with readthrough molecules. Other gene defects cause cell pathology related to protein misfolding rather than to a protein's loss of function. Chemical chaperones can prevent cell pathology resulting from mutations that cause secreted or membrane proteins to fold improperly."

9414204,"PROJECT ABSTRACT Background: Dysregulated Wnt/?-catenin signaling has been implicated in the pathogenesis of many common human cancers, making this an attractive clinical target. However, this has proven challenging because i) ?- catenin plays critical roles in normal tissue homeostasis, ii) its signaling pathways form part of a complex network of intersecting pathways, and iii) ?-catenin's mode of interaction with active sites on its partner proteins makes it difficult to identify molecular probes that specifically and selectively disrupt its oncogenic activity. Preliminary data: i) Development of peptidomimetics of the BCL9-HD2 domain that selectively suppress oncogenic Wnt activity by blocking interaction of ?-catenin with its transcriptional co-activator BCL9; ii) A high-throughput screening (HTS) AlphaScreen assay allowing identification of several small-molecule inhibitors of ?-catenin/BCL9 interaction has been implemented; iii) An in vivo model using BCL9 transgenic mice that develop lymphomas as well as lung and gastric adenocarcinomas has been put into place. These studies offer compelling proof-of-concept for i) a therapeutic strategy addressing a known oncogenic role of the Wnt/?-catenin/BCL9 transcriptional complex, and ii) a pharmacologic intervention via targeted disruption of this complex. Working hypothesis: i) The Wnt/?-catenin/BCL9 transcriptional complex performs critical roles in cancer pathogenesis, and targeted disruption of this complex represents a promising pharmacologic strategy for blocking oncogenic Wnt activity in cancer; ii) Potent, specific, competitive inhibition of the ?-catenin/BCL9 interaction can be accomplished by using small organic molecules that bind tightly to the BCL9-HD2 binding domain on ?-catenin. Goals: i) to characterize HTS ?hits? biophysically via rapid calorimetry-based assay; ii) to test inhibitors for functional activity in Wnt-relevant cell-based assays to ensure that the inhibitors have the desired molecular specificity. Experimental tools: i) Homogeneous biophysical assays (i.e. enthalpy change measurement and Isothermal titration calorimetry) that will robustly monitor disruption of ?-catenin/BCL9 binding in vitro, ii) X-ray crystallography to unequivocally establish the structural basis of this interaction and will lay groundwork for possible future structure-guided synthetic chemistry; iii) Cellular assays that will enable us to monitor the consequences of disrupting the ?-catenin/BCL9 complex in intact cells; and iv) Established xenograft and transgenic mouse models of cancers with a dysregulated Wnt/?-catenin/BCL9 complex will allow evaluation of the possible clinical usefulness of small-molecule inhibitors of BCL9/?-catenin interaction. Expected results: Structurally validated small-molecule chemical probes that i) target ?-catenin, ii) dissociate native ?-catenin/BCL9 complexes, iii) selectively suppress Wnt transcriptional activity, and iv) possess mechanism-based antitumor activity in vitro, and in vivo with minimal toxicity, will be identified. Implications to Medicine: Our work in this project is expected to afford highly selective clinical probes of oncogenic Wnt activity and innovative targeted therapies against Wnt/?-catenin/BCL9 dependent human cancers."

Work in the Core to achieve this function will be organized around three technologies. We will utilize advanced analysis techniques of multi-color flow cytometry and mass cytometry data to elucidate selected phenotypic properties of peanut allergen-reactive CD4+ T cells. These studies will complement standard flow and mass cytometry analyses performed in the PI's laboratories in project-specific experiments. We will use RNA-seq to elucidate full transcriptome phenotypes of bulk populations of peanut allergen specific CD4+ T cells. Knowledge from these experiments will drive design of better flow and mass cytometry experiments in the individual projects, and will aid in analysis of single cell RNA- sequencing (RNA-seq) experiments. We will utilize novel technologies to perform single cell analysis of transcriptome phenotypes and TCR clonotypes of allergen-specific CD4+ T cells. These experiments will facilitate understanding of heterogeneity of allergen-specific CD4+ T cells in PA and in determining mechanism(s) involved in successful OIT. Together, we expect the technologies we provide to play a major role in completion of the component projects, and in driving improved understanding of immune aspects of PA. We also anticipate identifying new biomarkers, new targets and better strategies for patient selection in OIT."

9574802,"Tumor diagnosis at early stage before its metastasis is critical to improve the survival of patients. We have developed a novel Multifunctional Agent for image-guided (PET/fluorescence) surgery with an option of Photodynamic therapy (PDT). in a recent study with a corresponding radioactive (I124-) analog, we were able to detect the primary and distant lesions from a breast tumor model known to metastasize to lung and bones. These results are exciting and provide an opportunity to use the PS (in combination with radioactive & nonradioactive analog) to image lung tumors by PET, and then treat them either by fluorescence-guided surgery in combination with PDT and/or chemotherapy. In a parallel study, we have shown that cell specificity of the iodinated PS in 3D culture system derived from cancer patients and the photo-induced STAT-3 dimerization can be used as a biomarker in optimizing the PDT treatment parameters in patients. We extrapolate that translating these findings to clinic will markedly change the treatment paradigm for loco-regional non-small cell lung cancer and will result in improved outcomes. Detection of occult lymph node disease will be enhanced and intraoperative adjuvant photodynamic therapy can be accomplished. Additionally, patients whose comorbidities preclude surgical resection can have a repeatable, effective PDT."

9389498,"?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Ocular Pulse Elastography Efforts to predict corneal ectasia risk secondary to keratoconus or refractive surgery will be greatly facilitated if the measures of corneal biomechanical properties are made available in vivo to improve current diagnoses based on structural (i.e., topographic and tomographic) evaluations alone.  For example, mechanical weaknesses (overall or regional) identified in patients' corneas (with or without topographical abnormalities) could alert physicians to closely monitor the condition and potentially initiate interventions to arrest ectatic progression.  Clinically, the ability to acquie spatially resolved biomechanical information is still lacking.  Many approaches have been proposed, but they often rely on an external force to deform the cornea in order to induce a mechanical response.  In addition, most methods do not explicitly address the influence of the intraocular pressure (IOP) on the measured properties.  In this project, we aim to build an ultrasound elastographic technique, termed as the ocular pulse elastography (OPE), to characterize the cornea's response to the cyclic variation of IOP at each cardiac cycle, i.e., the ocular pulse.  The baseline IOP and ocular pulse amplitude, which are all measurable in vivo, will be used in combination with the biomechanical measures from OPE to derive the intrinsic tissue biomechanical properties that are independent of the IOP parameters.  Our preliminary studies have demonstrated that the OPE technique, based on high frequency ultrasound radiofrequency data analysis, can provide a strain resolution of 0.05% and better, making it possible to reliably measure small in vivo strains induced by an ocular pulse of a few mmHg.  In the proposed research, we will (1) validate the OPE technique for mechanical characterization of the cornea; (2) evaluate the sensitivity of OPE in detecting clinically relevant corneal stiffening; (3) define the distribution and variance of OPE-derived corneal stiffness parameters in normal human subjects and their age-associated changes; and (4) test the prediction that corneal biomechanical properties are altered in keratoconus and develop OPE-based biomechanical indices for keratoconus.  The first two aims will investigate the relationship between OPE measures and those from traditional mechanical testing, as well as the effects of physiological variables and sensitivity, to build our knowledge of OPE in human eyes under controlled experimental conditions (i.e., in donor eyes) and provide optimal parametric settings and framework for acquiring and interpreting in vivo data.  The last two aims of the proposed research will bring the knowledge and technique from the bench to the bedside to acquire in vivo data from normal corneas and those with keratoconus, as the first step of establishing OPE's clinical use and identifying new, sensitive biomechanical metrics for ectasia risks.  The proposed research will address the need for in vivo volumetric biomechanical evaluation of the cornea, leading to a clinical tool for identifying and monitoring biomechanical instability or weakening to aid the diagnosis and treatment of ectatic disease.  More broadly, the proposed research will impact the field of ocular biomechanics, by generating in vivo techniques and data to better understand how biomechanics are involved in the health and disease of the eye."
9445924,"PROJECT SUMMARY Pulmonary fibrosis occurs when collagen production outpaces collagen degradation. The long-term goal is to understand the role of cell-mediated collagen degradation in regulating the severity of pulmonary fibrosis. The overall objective of this application is to elucidate the mechanisms by which 2 genes identified through a high- throughput screen of collagen turnover, Fatty Acid Synthase (FAS) and Cell Division Cyclase-like Related Protein Kinase (CDC7), regulate cell-mediated collagen turnover coupled with investigating the role in collagen turnover in human cells of candidate genes identified through the screen that when silenced increase collagen uptake. The central hypothesis is that cell-mediated clearance of collagen fragments regulates the severity of pulmonary fibrosis. Specifically, FAS-mediated production of lipid mediators promotes while CDC7 regulation of collagen endocytic machinery inhibits cellular uptake of collagen. An additional hypothesis is that there are genetic controls that prevent cells from engaging in matrix degradation and that silencing of these genes can augment collagen resorption thereby promoting resolution of tissue fibrosis. These hypotheses are built on data demonstrating that (1) RNAi-mediated silencing of FAS and CDC7 in Drosophila and mammalian cells leads to reduced and increased collagen uptake respectively; (2) pharmaceutical inhibition of CDC7 leads to increased collagen uptake and increased expression of collagen endocytic machinery; and (3) published work demonstrating that treatment with fatty acids reverses established lung fibrosis in mice by increasing collagen turnover; and (4) RNAi mediated silencing of a number of genes in Drosophila increases cell-mediated collagen turnover. These hypotheses will be tested through 3 specific aims: 1) Determining the role of FAS-mediated palmitoylation in regulating collagen endocytosis; determining the role of Flotillin-2 in resolving lung fibrosis by promoting collagen uptake; 2) Investigating whether CDC7 regulates collagen turnover by inhibiting expression of collagen degradation pathways; 3) Investigating whether silencing of mammalian orthologs of candidate genes identified in the Drosophila screen leads to an increase in cell-mediated collagen uptake. Aim 1 will examine the role of FAS-mediated palmitoylation of the vesicular transport proteins, Flotillin 1 and 2, in regulating the collagen endocytic machinery required for collagen uptake as well as the effect of in vivo transgenic deletion of Flotillin 2 on the severity of bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis. Aim 2 will examine the role of CDC7 in regulating expression of Endo180 and other mediators of collagen turnover and the effect of in vivo inhibition of CDC7 on macrophage-mediated collagen uptake. Aim 3 will examine the role in collagen turnover in mammalian cells of candidate genes identified through a Drosophila screen that when silenced increase collagen uptake. The proposed research is innovative, in the applicant's opinion, because it investigates the molecular basis of cell- mediated collagen turnover. The proposed research is significant because it has the potential to inform the development of therapeutics that treat established fibrotic disease."

9443857,"Abstract Controlling thrombosis is central to management of various pathologies. Studies proposed here will identify a new, unexpected path to thrombosis, involving the enzyme Lysyl Oxidase (LOX). The proposed work looks at LOX effects on platelet function and thrombosis in primary myelofibrosis (PMF), a pathology hallmarked by proliferation and clustering of megakaryocytes, and myelofibrosis in bone marrow. Data from the Swedish Cancer Register from 1980 to 2009 showed that in a cohort of 11,155 patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms and 44, 620 matched healthy controls, the risk of arterial thrombosis was significantly 4.9-fold increased (4.8-5.0 p<0.001) in the patients compared to matched controls, highlighting the importance of studying regulators implicated in controlling thrombosis associated with this pathology. LOX is known to oxidize peptidyl lysines, leading to cross-linked matrix proteins in the bone marrow niche. Our published studied identified a link between LOX upregulation in megakaryocytes and bone marrow fibrotic progression in a mouse model of myelofibrosis. Importantly, more recently we found LOX expression to be vastly upregulated in platelets of patients with PMF (of which the majority tested carry the JAK2V617F or calreticulin gene mutations), compared to matching controls, and platelets isolated from PMF patients have greater adhesion to type I collagen, compared to controls. Further, transgenic mouse platelets engineered to overexpress LOX, at a level similar to cells from a myelofibrotic mouse model, show increased adhesion to monomeric collagen, and significantly greater propensity for arterial thrombosis in vivo. Considering LOX known activity, we hypothesized that it influences platelets through lysine oxidation of at least one of the collagen receptors, further supported by preliminary studies involving Oxy-Western blot analysis. Thus, we propose two specific aims of research: Aim 1. To explore the mechanism by which LOX affects platelet response to collagen using proteomics approaches, and mouse and human MPN samples; Aim 2. To determine the relevance of LOX- regulated thrombosis in vivo in myelofibrotic mice, and the role of collagen receptors in this effect. Pursuing these aims will be facilitated by: 1) a new transgenic mouse line produced in our lab, in which platelet LOX level is upregulated under wild type background (free of MPN), and 2) the availability of a new LOX inhibitor, and Lox gene loss of function studies. This work is innovative in that we are the first to reveal a link between LOX and collagen receptors activation. Further, these receptors were not suspected before to be regulated by oxidation. Our research is significant in that it will shed new light on basic mechanisms of platelet activation, in general, and implicate LOX in thrombotic events related to PMF, thus, recognizing the LOX pathway as new potential target for future anti-thrombosis drug development."

9457274,"(Z/E)-Endoxifen ([Z/E]-4-hydroxy-N-desmethyltamoxifen) are metabolites of (Z)-tamoxifen, with (Z) endoxifen likely being responsible for the majority of tamoxifen?s pharmacologic activity1,2,3,4. Endoxifen is formed in two steps by cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 and CYP2D6, and then conjugated by phase II enzymes in the liver to inactive forms by sulfation or glucuronidation3,4,5.  Some studies have shown that impaired metabolic formation of endoxifen is associated with worse clinical outcomes for tamoxifen-treated patients. As such, the National Cancer Institute (NCI), Division of Cancer Prevention (DCP) is proposing to evaluate administration of (Z/E)-endoxifen in a topical gel formulation as localized transdermal therapy (LTT) for breast cancer prevention. Use of this formulation would allow delivery of the active tamoxifen metabolite directly to the target tissue, thereby reducing systemic exposure and associated uterine and thromboembolic risks, as well as eliminating metabolic dependence.   To support clinical studies with (Z/E)-endoxifen gel, NCI, DCP is seeking proposals from the Toxicology Contractors to conduct the following preclinical studies."

9430357,"The Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study was established in 1985 by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) to study the distribution and evolution of cardiovascular disease risk beginning in young adulthood in four U.S. communities (Birmingham, AL; Chicago, IL; Minneapolis, MN; and Oakland, CA) (http://www.cardia.dopm.uab.edu/). The original cohort (n=5,115) was selected to have approximately the same number of participants in subgroups of age (18-24 and 25-30), sex, race (black and white), and education (high school or less and more than high school) within each community.    At Year 30, the eighth examination, participants will be 48-60 years old, a time when risk factors and subclinical abnormalities are prevalent and clinical events continue to emerge. CARDIA offers the opportunity to address aspects of the development and progression of subclinical and clinical disease that cannot be addressed in older cohorts. Specifically, CARDIA offers the opportunity to phenotype early cardiovascular disease, including heart failure in a large cohort of white and black adults. In addition, risk factors for cardiovascular disease can be updated. With risk factor data from previous examinations, CARDIA has the ability to study how the entire trajectory of early adulthood to mid-to-late middle-age risk factors and their control affects development and progression of cardiac dysfunction."

9592637,"?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Genetics and evelopment nderlie both phenotypic diversity and pathologies with a developmental basis. An increasing number of studies, including genome-wide association studies of disease risk, are linking genetic components to adult phenotypes, but the specific cellular events that link underlying genotype to terminal phenotype can be difficult or impossible to study in many vertebrate systems. Experiments in this project will use an experimentally accessible phenotype (adult pigmentation) in a group of tractable vertebrate organisms (zebrafish and related fishes) to test hypotheses about the developmental connection between genotype and an adult phenotype with relevance to public health. These species develop strikingly different adult pigment patterns through changes in a complex, integrated developmental system characterized by extensive interactions between several migratory, neural crest-derived classes of pigment cells. This project will investigate species-differences in the first cell type to develop impact subsequent pattern development. The experiments in the first aim will determine (i) how the first type of pigment cell class to develop inhibits the development of subsequent chromatophores, (ii) how a genetic pathway evolved to drive the temporal sequence of pigment cell differentiation across species, and (iii) the role of a specific regulatory element in modulating gene expression across species. The experiments in the second aim will determine the developmental basis for a unique adult pigment pattern of vertical bars by determining (i) how cell migration has evolved to initiate the new pattern, and if changes in pigment cells or the tissue environment are responsible for the new pattern potentially through candidate genetic pathways resulting in altered cell differentiation. Training during this project will take place in an integrative environment at the intersection of genomics and empirical developmental biology. The experiments performed and the questions addressed during this project will provide meaningful contributions to understanding the post-embryonic developmental connection between specific genetic differences and diverse adult phenotypes in a model vertebrate system."

9581133,"Over the last few years, protocols have been established to develop the ?next generation? of cancer models, in vitro propagating cultures that can be verified to more closely represent the tumor from which they originated. Several groups have demonstrated that organoid cultures and conditionally reprogrammed cells in combination with unique media formulations offer new tools to address current gaps in our understanding of cancer initiation, development, and progression.  Systematic application of these novel culture methods now present an opportunity to develop a large library of cancer models that can be made available as a community resource to investigators in academia and the biopharmaceutical industry. In response to the opportunity, the National Cancer Institute?s (NCI) Office of Cancer Genomics (OCG), in the Center for Cancer Genomics (CCG), together with international institutions, has established a consortium, the Human Cancer Models Initiative (HCMI). HCMI?s goal is to make available to the scientific community large numbers of ?next generation? in vitro cancer models that are not encumbered with excessive intellectual property (IP) constraints.  In addition to clinical annotation, the cancer models, the ?parent? tumor, and a case-matched control sample need to have their genomes and transcriptomes characterized by sequencing.  This will enrich the models greatly as it will allow researchers using them to establish correlations between the somatic and inherited genotypes of the tumors and their response to small molecules and other experimental utilizations.  The characterization needs to be conducted using validated methods in a high-throughput fashion with a rapid turn-around time.  The aim is to have all the characterizations conducted on biomolecules from the same biospecimens for optimal analytical integration for data comparability.  This task order is to sequence the genomes and transcriptomes of each cancer model, the ?parent? tumor and case-matched normal.   Molecular characterization data will be made available through CCG?s Genomic Data Commons (GDC, https://gdc.nci.nih.gov/index.html).    To promote model use by the community, the HCMI members have committed to establish a comprehensive online catalog in which all generated models will be listed, to be developed under this task order.

9392934,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall purpose of this project is to determine on a molecular level how suppression or mutation of BMPR2 results in pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), in order to identify points for intervention. This has been a tremendous success in the first three years, as described in the progress report following. The current renewal focuses on developing our findings on a shift in energy metabolism towards glutaminolysis. Glutamine is a nonessential amino acid which in some cancers, and in PAH according to our data, has become the primary mitochondrial substrate. This increased glutamine uptake is required for cell survival and growth in BMPR2 mutants and cancer, but not in healthy tissue, making it an excellent diagnostic and therapeutic target. We first identified th shift to glutaminolysis in gene expression studies of BMPR2 mutant mice. The increased reliance on glutamine in Bmpr2 mutant cells was confirmed independently through glutamine uptake studies, stable isotope tracer studies using labeled glutamine, and through growth curves demonstrating a requirement for excess glutamine. Clinical studies demonstrated a twofold increase in serum glutamine levels in PAH patients of any etiology, combined with a 50% drop in glutamine levels across the lungs in PAH patients. This shift to reliance on glutamine has previously only been seen in neoplastic processes. The oxidative stress and metabolic defects are likely to be the basis of disease, not bystanders. We have shown in three molecularly different mouse models that these metabolic changes are part of pathogenesis, and there are now case reports on two patients in whom reversal of these changes resulted in dramatic hemodynamic improvement. The proposed studies will determine how the shift to glutaminolysis is happening, whether interfering with it is likely to be clinically useful, and whether it can be used as a diagnostic tool in patients."

9424721,"ABSTRACT Chronic kidney disease (CKD) affects 20 million Americans. CKD can lead to end stage renal disease and is associated with cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Early management focused on blood pressure control decreases cardiovascular morbidity and mortality and may ameliorate kidney disease progression. Yet, less than 40% of patients with CKD achieve recommended blood pressure targets. There are many barriers to achieving good blood pressure control. One patient-centric barrier we can target is that many CKD patients do not understand the health implications of CKD or what they need to do to optimize their health. Thus, promoting patient behaviors to improve outcomes, including blood pressure control, requires coordinated programs of education and support over time. However, a sustainable, evidence-based model for this does not exist for CKD. The central hypothesis of this study is that early patient CKD education combined with health coach support will improve patient behaviors aligned with blood pressure control by increasing patient knowledge, self-efficacy, and motivation. These in turn will lead to optimal health behaviors and improved blood pressure control. The long-term goal of this research is to develop, test, and disseminate sustainable patient-centric education and coaching support interventions to improve quality and outcomes in CKD. The objective of this proposal is to test the impact of a pilot-tested, provider-delivered patient education tool, followed with health coaching focused on blood pressure control. A cluster-randomized controlled trial will compare outcomes in patients with CKD stages 3-5 between intervention and control groups in primary care settings. Continuous quality improvement and systems methodologies will be used to optimize resource neutrality and identify how to leverage existing technology and resources to support implementation and future dissemination. Involving local partners from a state-wide primary care practice-based research network will support future transferability and uptake into community settings. This research is innovative because it represents a new and substantially different approach to addressing an important public health problem by focusing early in the care continuum to educate patients about CKD and supporting them in achieving clinical health targets by giving them coach support. Continuous quality improvement and systems methodologies will reinforce efficiency in the process, which is critical to future uptake in real-world practice. The proposed research is significant as it will result in a rigorously- tested, provider-delivered patient education tool and an efficient process for follow up that supports patients early in the care continuum. The end result will be a streamlined and efficient intervention that is well-poised for dissemination into community practice settings."

9415744,"Project Summary/Abstract Inwardly-rectifying K channel 4.1 (Kir4.1) is encoded by Kcnj10 and plays a dominant role in providing basolateral K conductance and in determining the negative membrane potential in the distal convoluted tubule (DCT). The critical role of Kir4.1 in the DCT is demonstrated by the report that loss-of-function mutations of Kcnj10 in the kidney cause tubulopathy, a disease which is reminiscent to Gitelman's syndrome including hypomagnesemia, hypokalemia and metabolic alkalosis. The renal phenotype of loss-function mutations of Kir4.1 observed in SeSAME/EAST syndrome is recapitulated in the kidney-specific Kir4.1 knockout (Ks-Kir4.1 KO) mouse model. We have demonstrated that Ks-Kir4.1 KO mice have severe hypokalemia and hypochloremic metabolic alkalosis, suggesting a defective membrane transport in the DCT. Kir4.1 interacts with Kir5.1 encoded by Kcnj16 to form a 40 pS K channel in the basolateral membrane of the DCT. While Kir4.1 is responsible for providing basolateral K conductance in the DCT, Kir5.1 may serve as a regulatory subunit for the heterotetramer. Kir5.1 contains a phosphor-threonine-based Nedd4 E3 ligase binding motif at its c-terminus (TPVT), which has been shown to be a binding site of Nedd4 in phosphatase CDC25c. The possibility that Kir5.1 may regulate Kir4.1 activity in the DCT through binding to Nedd4-2 is also suggested by our preliminary experiments showing that depletion of Kir5.1 and Nedd4-2 stimulates Kir4.1 activity which is known to stimulate NCC activity. NCC not only plays a role in mediating Na absorption in the DCT but also in regulating renal K excretion. Thus, the goal of the present application is to test hypothesis that Kir5.1 is the binding partner for Nedd4-2 E3 ligase which ubiquitinizes Kir4.1 and depolarizes membrane in the DCT and that Kir5.1 and Nedd4-2 E3 ligase play a key role in mediating the inhibitory effects of high Na and high K intake on the basolateral Kir4.1 and the apical NCC. The proposal has three specific aims: In specific aim 1, we will test whether Kir5.1(Kcnj16) is a binding partner of Nedd4-2 E3 ligase and that Nedd4-2 binding to Kir5.1 ubiquitinizes Kir4.1 and depolarizes the membrane in the DCT. In specific aim 2, we will test the hypothesis that Kir5.1 and Nedd4-2 E3 ligase are essential for mediating the inhibitory effect of high Na intake on Kir4.1 and NCC in the DCT. In specific aim 3, we will test the hypothesis that Kir5.1 and Nedd4-2 E3 ligase are essential for mediating the inhibitory effect of high K intake on Kir4.1 and NCC in the DCT. Since basolateral Kir4.1 plays a key role in regulating WNK-SPAK-NCC in the DCT , understanding the role of Kir5.1 and Nedd4-2 in regulating Kir4.1 will provide an integrated view regarding the regulation of K and Na transport in the distal tubules."

9527459,"Project Summary Several genera of maternally inherited symbiotic bacteria affect the reproductive biology of their host species by favoring infected female over male offspring. Wolbachia are the archetypes of this adaptive strategy and exist globally in an estimated 40% of all arthropod species and many filarial nematodes, making them one of the most prevalent bacterial infections on the planet. In a variety of arthropods including Coleoptera, Diptera, and Lepidoptera, as well as arachnids, Wolbachia can selectively kill sons of infected females in a process dubbed male killing. This form of sex-specific lethality enhances the spread of the bacteria by increasing the fitness of transmitting females through reduced competition with their dead brothers for limited resources. It can also spur host evolutionary responses including selection on hosts for male mate choice or Wolbachia density suppression as males become rare in populations experiencing high levels of male killing. Regarding vector control, new population models specify that male killing bacteria can speed up the eradication of target populations when used in conjunction with the sterile insect technique. However, despite decades of research on male killing and its relevance to ecology, evolution, and vector control, the microbial genetic basis remains enigmatic and one of the field's most central challenges to solve. We recently identified a candidate gene, hereafter known as WO Male Killing (wmk) from the prophage WO region of Wolbachia, that can cause male killing. When wmk is transgenically expressed in uninfected D. melanogaster embryos, it kills a significant number of male offspring as embryos. Additionally, cytological defects caused by male killing Wolbachia are enriched in wmk-expressing embryos versus controls. Furthermore, the defects occur around the time that the host dosage compensation complex (DCC) forms, and the DCC has previously been linked to bacterial male killing. As wmk represents a potential breakthrough in the search for a microbial gene that causes male killing, this project will test the central hypothesis that wmk is responsible for male killing, which acts by altering the activity of the host DCC. In Aim 1, we will assess if the developmental and cytological defects caused by transgenic wmk expression are the same as those of male killing Wolbachia. In Aim 2, we will test if wmk- induced male death is dependent upon a functional DCC or interacts with other host pathways. If successful, this research will verify the discovery of the first prophage gene that induces male killing and inform the future use of transgenic or paratransgenic strategies to curb the transmission of vector-borne diseases."

These and other observations suggest that a membrane-mediated process is operating in Alzheimer's disease with the potential to explain neuronal loss, fibril formation, and the lack of correlation between plaque deposition and the clinical severity of AD.  This is a proposal to quantify post-translationally modified forms of the amyloid beta protein, and search for similar modifications of other proteins in human brain tissue. Notably, this proposal will make use of novel biochemical assays and approaches to identify and quantify these modifications."

A large biospecimen repository is available for analysis and offers a good platform for testing multiple hypotheses. This statement of work is for the measurement of stored biospecimens in the EAGeR Trial. The proposed assays will provide a rich data source on biomarker levels that can answer novel research questions in conjunction with the extensive data already collected in the EAGeR Trial. A growing body of evidence suggests that exposure to many common environmental chemicals, particularly those with endocrine-disrupting properties, may be associated with impaired fecundability and increased risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes. However, much of the findings to date have been equivocal. There is a need to further investigate the potential role of environmental chemical exposures in leading to adverse reproductive and gestational outcomes, particularly among prospective studies with gold standard ascertainment of reproductive and pregnancy outcomes. Due to much prior research being conducted among individuals with occupational exposure, there is also a need for additional research among healthy adults with similar exposure levels to the general population, to ascertain whether background exposure to key environmental chemicals may pose reproductive health risks. Finally, although phenols, such as BPA, and phthalates are known endocrine disruptors, few studies have evaluated their association with reproductive outcomes. There is also a great need for research on emerging endocrine disruptors, including parabens and benzophenones, and reproductive outcomes."

Because they resemble human cancers both clinically and biologically, the NCI has decided to explore the use of naturally occurring cancers in dogs as surrogates of human cancers for rapidly evaluating new IO combinations and prioritizing only the most promising ones to advance into humans.. Small, fast Phase 0 canine trials examining the response of molecular biomarkers measured with validated, fit-for-purpose pharmacodynamic (PD) assays should further increase this throughput, analogous to the use of PD biomarkers as endpoints of Phase 0 trials in humans.  In order to explore the resemblance in immunotherapy response between human and canine cancers that are MSI-H (a DCTD and COP collaboration), however, a therapeutic monoclonal antibody (MAb) targeting canine CTLA-4 is required.  The absence of such a Mab is holding up the clinical evaluation of the benchmark combination regimen in dogs.  The NCI has decided to fill this gap immediately by tasking the contractor to create a therapeutic canine monoclonal antibody against CTLA-4 that possesses analogous properties to ipilimumab, its human analog. DCTD will also require the development of validated, fit-for-purpose clinical assays suitable for analyzing PD response and MSI status in canine cancer biopsies.

9430356,"pNGVL4a-hCRT/E6E7L2, is a naked DNA vaccine directed at HPV E6, E7, and L2 proteins, with the goal to develop a therapeutic vaccine capable of inducing cellular immunity to eliminate HPV infection and HPV-associated lesions. The newly licensed HPV vaccines, Gardasil and Cervarix, both based upon L1 virus-like particles (VLPs), are effective only for prevention of new genital infections by the HPV genotypes included in the vaccines. Unfortunately, the L1 VLP vaccines do not alter the course of established HPV infections, and thus will not reduce rates of HPV-related cancer for several decades; additionally, they are not effective against all oncogenic HPV types. There is a clear unmet need for a broadly protective HPV vaccine that is also able to trigger the clearance of established HPV infections and associated neoplasia, particularly in immunocompromised persons such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)+ patients who have higher rates of HPV-related cancers. pNGVL4a-hCRT/E6E7L2 was generated by fusing human calreticulin (CRT) to HPV16 E6 and E7 genes, each containing multiple inactivating mutations and codons optimized for high level expression, and capsid L2 protein amino acid residues 11?200. In proof-of-concept (PoC) studies in mice, vaccination with the pNGVL4a-hCRT/E6E7L2 DNA vaccine was shown to be capable of generating a strong E6/E7-specific CD8+ T cell immune response that resulted in a potent therapeutic effect against E6/E7-expressing TC-1 tumor cells. Furthermore, significant L2-specific antibodies were generated that were able to neutralize HPV 16 virions. In another PoC study in mice, vaccination with hCRTE6E7L2 DNA elicited a potent antitumor effect against E7-expressing tumors even in mice depleted for CD4+ T cells, suggesting that this vaccine may be active even in immune-compromised hosts. A head-to-head comparison of various administration methods for delivery of a DNA vaccine encoding CRT linked to HPV16 E7 (pNGVL4a-CRT/E7) was performed in a preclinical model, and tested with conventional intramuscular (IM) needle administration, electroporation (EP)-mediated IM delivery, and particle-mediated epidermal delivery via gene gun. Results showed that EP-mediated IM delivery generated higher levels of circulating protein and higher numbers of E7-specific CD8+ T cells among splenocytes compared to conventional IM injection. The enhanced CD8+ T cell immune response detected in EP-vaccinated mice translated into superior antitumor effects in E7-expressing tumors in tumor-bearing mice suggesting that EP-mediated delivery may provide an advantage compared to conventional IM delivery of the vaccine. Based on this promising preclinical data, a contract manufacturer has generated a GMP Master Cell Bank and manufactured clinical grade pNGVL4a-hCRT/E6E7L2 DNA. A toxicology study to assess the safety of pNGVL4a-hCRT/E6E7L2 DNA vaccine in mice when administered using the TriGrid Delivery System (TDS)-IM EP device (Ichor Medical Systems, Inc.) is required to support a planned clinical trial evaluating the safety and feasibility of DNA vaccination of patients with HPV16-associated cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) 2/3, as part of the Cervical Cancer SPORE program."
9578336,"Abundant evidence exists that substance abuse and behavioral health problems are a serious public health concern and are associated with a range of poor outcomes and costs, including damaged life course and careers, lost work productivity, higher medical care costs, and harm to others. Health care systems experience problems with lack of tools, lack of knowledge, process variation, and system fragmentation in addressing behavioral health. As an ongoing science-based process for improving care and lowering costs, robust increases in translational capability are needed to re-tool health delivery systems for behavioral health integration. A logic linking translational capability to behavioral health integration as an ongoing shared information process, founded on the core belief that enabling human action with new information technology tools can grow knowledge, is the most powerful way to solve problems and improve health care. Given these connected and interacting issues and obstacles, the solution strategy is built on four tiers of prior innovation and validation: 1. the Behavioral Health Screen (BHS), a comprehensive, validated, self-report screening and tracking tool; 2. BH-Works, the web services software delivery of BHS; 3. BH-Works Portal, a community collaboration and behavioral health integration hub; and 4. BH-Works Services, expertise and professional services to help community providers and healthcare systems integrate behavioral health into their organizations and workflows.  The objectives of this project are to innovate with new tools and rigorous evidence on their impacts in three areas: 1. care processes; 2. data analytics, and 3. information analysis. Results will be applied through our behavioral health ecosystem, based on our existing and growing network of clients and partners, who share our belief that trust, behavioral health, and quality of life can be achieved through an intelligent evolution of relationships, best practices, and collaborative knowledge."

9455945,"Project Summary/Abstract Parental history of type 2 diabetes (T2D), undernutrition, or obesity confers substantial risk for obesity and T2D in the offspring, with effects sustained over multiple generations. Genetic variation explains only a portion of this risk. Epigenetic mechanisms (e.g. DNA methylation, histone modification, noncoding RNA [ncRNA]), can regulate transcriptional responses to physiologic stimuli, independent of DNA sequence and can be maintained post-mitotically, imparting long-term effects. Maternal health during pregnancy is now recognized to shape epigenetic marks and disease phenotypes in offspring. However recent data from our lab and others show that health and nutrition of fathers, too, can contribute to disease risk in their progeny. We have shown that F1 offspring of females undernourished during pregnancy develop glucose intolerance, dysregulated lipid metabolism, and obesity ? similar to metabolic syndrome in humans. Strikingly, metabolic risk can also be transmitted to subsequent generations via the paternal lineage, yielding obesity and glucose intolerance in both F2 and F3 generations. Such paternal-lineage effects suggest that sperm or seminal fluid components may influence offspring development via epigenetic mechanisms stemming from prior environmental exposures. Supporting this possibility, we have shown that in utero undernutrition alters DNA methylation in spermatozoa of F1 offspring males in adulthood and expression of genes neighboring these loci in F2 embryos. Other studies have demonstrated modulation of sperm DNA methylation and ncRNA by diet, obesity, and diabetes. Together, these data support the hypothesis that metabolic health of males can alter sperm epigenetic marks, and suggest a novel, modifiable mechanism of transmission. Given the unprecedented T2D and obesity epidemics, and high risk of T2D in offspring of fathers with T2D, paternal diabetes is an important target for translational studies. However, it is unknown how human sperm epigenetic patterns change with glycemic control, and whether this may modify health of offspring. We hypothesize that epigenetic marks in human sperm are modified by a man's diabetes control. The Joslin WhyWAIT program, an intensive outpatient medical diabetes management program, has been shown to robustly improve glycemic control. Thus, we propose to test whether non-coding RNA and DNA methylation in human sperm can be modified in response to this intensive metabolic health intervention. In Aim 1, we will test whether improvements in glycemic control in men with T2D alter sperm DNA methylation and ncRNA species. In Aim 2, we will determine the background variation in the human sperm epigenome by analyzing epigenetic marks in men with and without T2D not undergoing metabolic intervention. In Aim 3, we will test causal relationships between glycemic control, BMI, ncRNA, and sperm DNA methylation using detailed bioinformatics and causal inference analysis. Together, these studies will provide proof-of-concept for modifiable mechanisms of paternal risk transmission and lay the foundation for future efforts to establish impact on offspring."
9574505,"Clonogneic assays measure the ability of single cells to proliferate and form a colony. This process approximates closely the regrowth and recurance of tumors after treatment with radiation or chemotherapy, providing a ready assay to screen for drugs that block this process. Yet, clonogenic assays are laborintensive and too cumbersome for high throughout screening (HTS) of compound libraries. Here we propose to develop a HTS system based on a clonogenic endpoint. A close examination of the literature and our own work shows that all necessary components for an HTS with a clonogenic endpoints already exist through efforts in the industry and academia. We will combine these and validate their utility by comparing with conventional clonogenic assays, to produce an HTS system with defined and validated standared opeating procedures. This system will be transferrable to other laboratories. Potential commercial applications include screening compound libraries for hits with dose-modification for radiation or chemotherapeutics. The HTS system we propose to develop will allow us to identify new compounds with the potential to inhibit regrowth of tumors after treatment. The HTS system will also allow us to rapidly test the efficacy of combining existing drugs or drugs with radiation, thus identifying rational treatment combinations."

9434827,"ABSTRACT Infertility affects approximately 15% of couples in North America. As couples increasingly postpone childbearing to the later reproductive years, many seek infertility treatment, which costs an estimated $5 billion per year, has relatively low success rates, and is associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes. Identifying modifiable risk factors for subfertility is an important public health goal. The present application proposes to investigate the influence of cervical dysplasia, surgical treatments for cervical dysplasia, and HPV vaccination on female fertility in an analysis of over 15,000 female pregnancy planners from three interrelated NICHD-funded prospective cohort studies. The cervix plays an important role in fertility by keeping pathogens out of the upper reproductive tract while also facilitating transport of sperm. Cervical dysplasia and surgical treatments can disrupt the cervical ecosystem by altering mucus production and immunological factors, which in turn may affect female fertility. Previous studies on this topic have been inconclusive and have had several methodologic limitations. The proposed study will use registry-based data on cervical pathology and cervical surgeries from more than 10,000 Danish women and self-reported data with medical record validation from 5,500 women in the United States and Canada. We will prospectively assess the relation of cervical dysplasia and treatments for cervical dysplasia? loop electrosurgical excision procedure (LEEP) conization (knife cone or laser), cryosurgery, and laser ablation? in relation to time-to-pregnancy (TTP). We will also assess the extent to which the recency of cervical dysplasia diagnosis and treatment affects delayed conception. The role of human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination on female fertility will also be assessed. We will stratify analyses by smoking status, history of sexually transmitted infections, and other potential effect modifiers. The prospective design of the proposed study will minimize misclassification of exposure, outcome, and covariates, reduce selection bias, and clarify temporality. The inclusion of women from the entire fertility spectrum, and from three countries (Demark, United States, and Canada), will enhance generalizability of the results. HPV vaccination, cervical dysplasia, and treatment for cervical dysplasia are understudied risk factors for subfertility and infertility. This prospective study will be the largest and most informative investigation of these associations to date. By leveraging existing web-based methods and infrastructure supported by the NICHD, the proposed study will be extremely cost-effective relative to a study designed de novo. The results will allow clinicians to more accurately counsel women about the associations of HPV infection, cervical dysplasia, and dysplasia treatment with fertility to maximize successful childbearing. Findings from the proposed research are likely to have a large and sustained impact on the field of reproductive medicine."

9563034,"The Agricultural Health Study (AHS) cohort consists of approximately 52,000 private pesticide applicators (primarily farmers) and 32,000 spouses of private applicators from Iowa and North Carolina, as well as approximately 5,000 commercial pesticide applicators from Iowa. The pesticide applicators were recruited between 1993-1997 (during Phase I of the AHS) when they obtained or renewed their license to apply restricted use pesticides; spouses were recruited largely by questionnaires brought home by the  pesticide applicator (81%). In addition to the extensive information on lifetime use of pesticides, demographic and other lifestyle factors were collected from all participants at enrollment using self-administered questionnaires (during Phase I of the AHS). Two follow-up telephone interviews have been conducted since enrollment. The first follow-up interview was conducted from 1999 to 2003 (during Phase II of AHS), and the second follow-up interview was conducted from 2005-2009 (during Phase III of the AHS). Cancer incidence has been ascertained by annual linkage to the cancer registries in each state and mortality through linkage to the National Death Index since the inception of the study field work in 1993.    The AHS began field work for Phase I of the study with three contracts in 1993. One contract was for a coordinating center (SRA Technology) which was primarily responsible for overall coordination of the study, developing questionnaires, and providing a secure computer system to store the vast amount of questionnaire and other research data coming from the field stations in Iowa and North Carolina. The other two contracts were for a field station in Iowa (University of Iowa) and a second field station in North Carolina (Battelle Memorial Institute). Field Stations were primarily responsible for managing the distribution and retrieval of self-administered questionnaires to eligible study subjects. The coordinating center contract was awarded, via a full and open competition, to SRA Technologies for Phase II of the study and to Westat Inc. for Phase III of the study; Westat assumed the coordinating center contract during Phase II when SRA Technologies went out of business.

9563040,"Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the U.S. Malignant mesothelioma (MM) is an aggressive, therapy-resistant lung cancer that arises primarily from the mesothelial lining of the pleural and peritoneal cavities. Patients with MM usually present with advanced-stage disease that is often surgically inoperable and refractory to standard chemotherapeutic regimens. A marked increase in MM incidence is predicted in developing countries, where usage of asbestos is increasing at an alarming rate. Thus, new approaches for the prevention and management of this disease are urgently needed.  MM is a cancer characterized by recurrent genomic losses that typically occur in combination. Molecular genetic studies of human MMs have uncovered recurrent mutations/deletions of several tumor suppressor genes, particularly CDKN2A (encoding p16INK4A and p14ARF), NF2, and BAP1. Genetically engineered mouse models of MM have demonstrated that haploinsufficiency for Cdkn2a, Nf2, or Bap1 accelerates asbestos-induced MM onset and progression, thereby providing both experimental evidence in support of the pivotal role of these tumor suppressor genes in MM pathogenesis and relevant murine models to facilitate preclinical studies of novel chemopreventive and chemotherapeutic agents.  Upon exposure to asbestos, macrophages are recruited to sites of asbestos deposition, indicating that one physiological response to mineral fiber exposure is inflammation. Mice exposed to asbestos exhibit recruitment of activated macrophages to the mesothelium. As a result of increased macrophage accumulation, the nearby mesothelial cells are thought to be exposed to pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1? and TNF?. Interestingly, IL-1? and TNF? can act in concert with asbestos fibers to transform normal mesothelial cells in vitro, suggesting that inflammation may directly contribute to MM development. IL-1? has been shown to increase the proliferative capacity of mesothelial cells in vitro while depletion of activated macrophages in an orthotopic mouse model of MM was found to diminish tumorigenesis.  Another cytokine, IL-6, is also potentially a key player in asbestos-induced MM formation as the levels of this proinflammatory cytokine are elevated in asbestos exposed mice. Collectively, these data imply that recruitment of activated macrophages as a result of inflammation contributes to mesothelial proliferation and transformation through release of the cytokines IL-1?, IL-6, and TNF?. Thus, chronic inflammation associated with exposure to asbestos may represent a form of extrinsic cancer-related inflammation and may serve as an early intervention target for the delay or prevention of this cancer. Targeting the immune regulators of asbestos induced inflammatory represent a novel approach to the prevention of this deadly disease."
9448408,"There is an unmet need to inhibit the key cancer promoting transcription factor MYC (both c-MYC and MYCN) that act downstream of many cell receptors and signal transcription pathways to activate genes for cancer cell resistance, tumor growth and the control of antitumor immunity. To date, small molecule inhibitors of MYC have remained elusive. In our preliminary data, we developed a lead compound, SF2523 which displays potent orthogonal inhibitory activity against MYC by blocking PI-3 kinase (PI-3K) and the highly dominant regulator of epigenetic machinery, BRD4. Herein, we set out to develop SF2523 and other chemotypes through additional in silico crystal structure and NMR analysis and optimization in preparation for advanced preclinical studies for therapeutic application in Myc dependent cancers.  The transcription factor, MYC (c-MYC and MYCN) plays a key role in cancer growth, proliferation, survival, and more recently in the control of antitumor immunity. It is overexpressed in a subgroup of most human cancers resulting in resistance to PI-3K and other signaling pathway inhibitors. Both MYC and PI-3K are well- established onco-proteins that are confirmed drivers in a large number of tumor types. Moreover, BRD4 is rapidly emerging as a dominant epigenetic regulator of the transcriptome and of cancer cell resistance to kinase inhibition. Therefore, there is general consensus in the cancer biology arena that inhibition of BRD4 and/or MYC should prove beneficial in multiple cancers where MYC is an established regulator of tumor cell transformation and resistance. Our innovative approach centers on our central hypothesis that a dual PI- 3K/BRD4 inhibitor, SF2523, will potently inhibit MYC activity by enhancing its degradation via PI-3K inhibition AND block MYC transcriptional activity via BRD4 inhibition. Our preliminary data supports our success in that we solved the crystal structure of SF2523 in the active site of BRD4 and determined the structure activity relationships (SAR) around dual PI-3K/BRD4 inhibitors designed by validated molecular modeling studies and demonstrated the safety of our dual-targeting single inhibitor versus the accumulated toxicity of using two separate inhibitors. Our preliminary studies support our specific aims which include: 1) SAR to optimize the dual inhibitory chemotype (Aim 1) built around our crystal structure and NMR analyses (Aim 2) in parallel with 2) the evaluation of safety, PK/PD modeling and antitumor efficacy of each oral optimized chemotype (Aim 3). The objective of our proposal is to advance the preclinical development and validation of this novel dual PI- 3K/BRD4 inhibitor, SF2523 or its derivative as a final drug candidate against PI-3K/MYC-driven malignancies with high mortality rates e.g. hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and squamous cell carcinoma of the head/neck (SCCHN) and obtain an optimized oral candidate for final development. Moreover, our aims seek to identify PI-3K and MYC tumor signatures which will define sensitivity to SF2523 as we move toward a Phase I clinical trial of this ?first in class? dual PI-3K/BRD4 inhibitory chemotype for individualized cancer therapeutics."

9430235,"The Maternal and Pediatric Infection Disease (MPIDP) Branch of the Center for Research for Mothers and Children (CRMC) of the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) has a need for a Data Coordinating Center to continue the current activities of development, implementation, and direction of a wide range of domestic and international research activities for the study of epidemiology, clinical manifestations, pathogenesis, transmission, treatment, and prevention of HIV infection and its infectious and noninfectious complications in infants, children, adolescents, and women (pregnant and non-pregnant). The Contractor will furnish all the necessary services, qualified personnel, materials, equipment, and facilities needed to implement, maintain, coordinate, and manage a multi-site network of clinical centers to conduct current and future clinical trials of the preceding referenced research. The Data Coordinating Center will facilitate the research for the evaluation of investigational therapies, diagnostic techniques, prevention strategies, epidemiology and natural history of multiple aspects of HIV infection and disease and other high priority infections in pediatric, adolescent, and maternal patient populations, in addition to those tasks outlined elsewhere in the Statement of Work for the base contract and its separate options. This contract is for the Data Coordinating Center for domestic and international AID Network clinical trials for the Maternal and Pediatric Infectious Disease Branch (MPIDB) (formerly the Pediatric, Adolescent, and Maternal AIDS Branch). The NICHD Network conducts trials related to preventing and treating HIV infection and its complications in newborns, infants, children, adolescents, and pregnant women. Since 1987, has funded the NICHD Network, currently composed of 25 domestic sites in 13 states and territories and 9 international sites in Latin America, plus a Data Coordinating Center (DCC). The NICHD Network was established to conduct a single clinical trial evaluating the use of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) prophylaxis for bacterial infections in 376 HIV-infected children. Over time, the NICHD Network has expanded with changes in the demographics of pediatric and maternal HIV infection. The number and type of clinical trial sites in the Network have changed, as well as the types of studies being done. In 1990, the NICHD Network began collaborating with the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID)-funded Pediatric AIDS Clinical Trials Group (PACTG) to expand clinical trial availability at NICHD clinical trials sites. This collaboration made it possible to conduct clinical trials further evaluating primary antiretroviral therapeutic agents, other therapies targeted at opportunistic infections, and interventions to prevent perinatal HIV transmission. This NIAID-NICHD Network collaboration continues today with the NIAID-funded International Pediatric Maternal Adolescent AIDS Clinical Trials (IMPAACT) Group. The NICHD Network expanded to include sites with more expertise in obstetrics/gynecology and adolescent medicine, as well as international trial sites in Latin America. As the HIV epidemic has evolved, so has the research addressed by the NICHD Network. In populations of women and children, research gaps related to HIV-associated co-infections  have emerged as HIV research has become increasingly global in nature. As a result, the NICHD Network and NIAID-funded IMPAACT Group broadened their focus to include HIV-associated co-infections, and investigation of vaccines to prevent HIV-related or other high-priority infectious diseases in children, adolescents, and pregnant women, in addition to treatment of HIV infection. In addition to its work with the IMPAACT Group described above, the NICHD Network collaborates with several other networks to design and conduct HIV-related trials. Funded by the NICHD, other NIH Institutes, and other agencies, these networks include (but are not limited to):  Adult AIDS Clinical Trials Group ? Adolescent Medicine Trials Network for HIV/AIDS Interventions  Pediatric European Network for Treatment of AIDS (PENTA)  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Tuberculosis Trials Consortium The NICHD Network relies on flexible contract mechanisms to initiate timely, high-priority initiatives in response to unanticipated research needs and to conduct planned studies with established protocols. In addition to a DCC, the NICHD Network uses a centralized specimen repository to store coded biological specimens from NICHD Network studies. This repository serves as a resource for Network and external investigators who are interested in answering specific questions related to HIV/AIDS."

9430048,"Laboratory of Human Toxicology and Pharmacology (LHTP) - The Laboratory of Human Toxicology and Pharmacology (LHTP) provides technical and operational support for DCTD programs designed to increase the pace and accuracy of drug development in oncology and facilitate the entry of new chemical entities (NCEs) for cancer treatment into Phase 0 and I clinical trials. LHTP is an integrated, multi-disciplinary laboratory program that builds on the foundation of pharmacodynamics (PD) and toxicodynamics (TD) to predict the desirable and undesirable human drug effects that will likely be encountered during the clinical evaluation of both traditional cytotoxic as well as newer molecular target based small molecules and engineered therapeutic viruses. LHTP expertise in predictive human toxicology using in vitro models, pharmacodynamic assay development and clinical implementation, and preclinical drug formulation combine to humanize treatment regimens, therapeutic assessment, and interpretation of non-clinical models of cancer. The laboratory integrates this novel expertise to ?humanize? treatment and assessment of mouse models of human disease in order to validate pharmacodynamic assays for use as primary endpoints of Phase 0 trials, which are conducted under exploratory IND guidelines from the FDA to confirm that a NCE works in man as it has in the preclinical models. The integrated approach includes a route of administration, dosage form, dose level, and clinical sampling procedures (e.g., anesthesia, needle, or excisional biopsy) that are directly relevant to a Phase 0 clinical trial. The LHTP introduced the concept and practice of completely humanizing preclinical models of cancer therapy, which led to the use of clinical biopsy procedures in human xenograft and orthotopic tumor models to prove the clinical readiness of a PD assay. LHTP took the lead in ?reverse translational? research, to learn the clinical procedures of tissue collection and then transfer them to DTP/BTB. Comparing humanized and traditional preclinical study designs in cancer models over several years will yield the results required to determine whether this approach improves the correlation between nonclinical models and the clinic. The LHTP is organized into four specialized, but interrelated, sections that align with the technical support needs of DCTD: Pharmacodynamic Assay Development and Implementation (PADIS), Predictive Toxicology (PTS), Viral Vector Toxicology (VVTS), and Formulation Development (FDS). The laboratory director manages the overall scientific program of the LHTP and its coordination with DCTD operations, including coordinated interactions and assay transfers from LHTP to the National Clinical Target Validation Laboratory (NCTVL) operating at the NIH campus.  Pharmacodynamic Assay Development and Implementation Section (PADIS) -  Modern developmental therapeutic efforts for cancer utilize an understanding of signal transduction or differentiation pathways to identify new drug candidates that exert defined actions on the functional status of these targets. Some of these defined molecular effects will have therapeutic potential, leading to apoptosis, differentiation, or other desirable changes in the function of cancer cells. By coordinated use of the preclinical efficacy models of the Biological Testing Branch of DTP, it is possible to define the relationship between the extent of drug effect in the tumor and the level of drug exposure associated with these effects. Clinical confirmation of these preclinical findings would provide strong rationale for a full clinical development program, and the FDA recently authorized a new type of early clinical trial to explore microdoses of investigational agents prior to full dose finding and safety trials. This exploratory IND mechanism (x-IND) is relevant for multiple therapeutic classes, and is being used by the DCTD to conduct such confirmatory studies of molecular drug action on tumor target in a small number of patients prior to full clinical development (termed ?Phase 0 trials? at the NCI). Failure of a NCE to affect molecular target during the Phase 0 trial would provide a rationale to halt its development. The mission of PADIS is to provide expert technical support to this DCTD initiative by developing and validating laboratory assays that quantify a drug's effect on a molecular target in a tumor (and, if possible, in surrogate tissues as well), and can be readily implemented in the clinical setting. PADIS uses preclinical models to develop and validate pharmacodynamic (PD) assays and companion procedures for tissue acquisition that will be used in the clinical trial without change. A unique aspect of the PADIS approach is the constraints imposed on the development and validation of PD assays by the radiological, surgical, and anesthesia procedures and practices that will eventually be used clinically to obtain the tissue specimens for the PD assays. This is a technical area that has been underappreciated in the past, and PADIS works closely with BTB to integrate anticipated medical procedures into the preclinical models and develop clinically ready assays. When they can be established as accurate reporters of drug action in tumor, surrogate organ compartments (such as peripheral blood mononuclear cells or bone marrow or buccal keratinocytes) are useful for less invasive monitoring of drug effects than biopsies. As the final step in PD assay development and implementation, PADIS is responsible for cross-training the Bethesda-based NCTVL staff in the new assays and then coordinating with NCTVL to transfer the validated method to the clinical laboratory for deployment in the x-IND clinical trial. PADIS plays a key technical role in the developmental stages of clinical pharmacodynamic projects of the DCTD and its collaboration with the CCR in Phase 0 clinical trials. These stages can be summarized as: rapid development and validation of sensitive, SOP-driven methodologies to quantify the impact of drug treatment on molecular target(s) in tumors; identification of normal tissue that is a surrogate for tumor, if possible (PBMCs, skin, saliva, buccal mucosa, etc); development and validation of clinically-transferable, SOP-driven  procedures for tissue collection and processing that will provide evaluable specimens in the clinical setting; and oversee the transfer of validated PD assays to the NCTVL for deployment in clinical trials, and if necessary, contribute to assays of clinical specimens.  Predictive Toxicology Section (PTS) - The Predictive Toxicology Section (PTS) was established to facilitate the maturation and validation of assays that have been shown to predict human toxicity, and deploy them in concert with pharmacokinetic (PK)/ pharmacodynamic (PD) programs in the DTP to facilitate development of NCEs more efficiently and accurately for potential advancement to clinical trials. Preclinical toxicology studies on potential cancer chemotherapeutic agents are generally conducted in two species of animals with the goals of defining the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), dose-limiting toxicities (DLT), schedule dependency of toxicity, reversibility of adverse effects, and a safe clinical starting dose (SD). These animal studies do not always permit detailed evaluations of molecular toxicity, especially in relation to the expected mechanism in man and the role of off-target effects in mediating toxicity. Furthermore, the in vivo data sometimes show discrepancies between species that create uncertainty about human safety and result in low starting doses in early clinical trials. The PTS is tasked with the development of in vitro tissue, cellular, and molecular assays that use normal target tissues of drug toxicity and clinically relevant endpoints (e.g., in vitro ?transaminitis?) to evaluate potential human safety, predict tolerated human doses, and allow direct comparison of human and animal drug tolerance prior to clinical trials. This information can be used to include predicted human tolerated dose levels into studies by PADIS to validate PD assays at predicted clinical dose levels, increasing confidence that a target response to the drug will be detected clinically. The recent validation of in vitro bone marrow assays for neutropenia using rodent, canine, and human CFU-GM myeloid stem cells demonstrated the value of in vitro assays for predicting in vivo toxicities in animals and man. The PTS seeks to extend the application of the validated testing principles to other dose-limiting organ system toxicities, including pulmonary, hepatic, and cardiac toxicities. In addition, PTS is tasked with assisting the Toxicology and Pharmacology Branch, DTP in its evaluation of newly developed in vitro toxicity tests under its grant program entitled ?Innovative Toxicology Models for Drug Evaluation? and the importing of promising assays into PTS for validation. The in vitro models of normal tissue response to adverse drug effects are expected to provide a simpler system than the in vivo models used for the discovery of off-target drug effects that can be circumvented via analoging and toxicodynamic markers of organ toxicity, which become candidates for valid assay development by PADIS and used by medical laboratories to monitor for early stages of drug toxicity prior to the development of symptoms. Newly developed in vitro assays are validated and then transferred to the VVTS for specialized applications in the assessment of human safety of engineered viral therapeutics (see below). These novel safety assessment tools can be deployed in the pre-IND or IND-directed setting.  Viral Vector Toxicology Section (VVTS) - The primary mission of the VVTS is to provide support for preclinical development of anticancer viral vectors. The research efforts are currently focused on the investigation of human toxicity potential of novel anticancer viral vectors by using humanized in vitro assay systems, and the evaluation of oncolytic activity and tumor selectivity of cancer-targeting viral vector agents. The VVTS explores the potential application of newly developed toxicity tests in PTS to the in vitro human safety assessment of engineered viral therapeutics. Additional areas of research include the assessment of the feasibility and efficacy of anticancer vector-combination therapy, consisting of viral vector agents and other cancer treatments of different modalities (e.g., chemotherapy or radiation); the elucidation of the molecular basis of tumor selection and oncolysis by candidate viral vectors; identification and establishment of tumor-specific biomarkers of viral agent-susceptible cancers, which can be adopted for future in vivo applications; and the development of optimal viral burden quantification assays to monitor the replication of viral vectors in targeted (tumor) and non-targeted (normal) tissue compartments in conjunction with in vivo safety and/or efficacy evaluations. During the reporting period, VVTS established a new in vitro assay system to evaluate the hepatotoxic potential of adenovirus-based anticancer vectors using primary human hepatocytes, characterized differential hepatotoxicity profiles of recombinant adenoviral vectors developed as therapeutic agents under the RAID program, and began collaboration with Biological Testing Branch (BTB), DTP, to evaluate the in vivo efficacy of oncolytic reovirus type 3 Dearing strain in a human melanoma xenograft model.  Formulation Development Section  Many NCEs that show promising anticancer characteristics exhibit very low aqueous solubility, which creates technical difficulties during in vitro and in vivo evaluations. The Formulation Development Section (FDS) is tasked with development of preclinical formulations of these NCEs suitable for intravenous injection and oral administration to mice and dogs and for testing in vitro in cell cultures. The FDS is developing a novel, moderate-throughput strategy comprised of an initial empirical screen, using 2?5 mg of each NCE, to test for solubility in a dozen proven vehicles representing diverse solubilizing mechanisms, which have been used clinically. Suitability of these candidate pre-formulations for injection is proven by continued solubility when challenged with physiological fluids. It is expected that 10?20% of poorly soluble NCEs will not be solubilized by conventional vehicles, and so the next step in the strategy is formulation testing of NCEs in novel pharmaceutical technology platforms, such as nanodispersions and emulsions, targeted nano-particles, and targeted carrier proteins. Although not all NCEs will have been formulatable by the end of the second step, this strategy is expected to achieve solubility and consistency requirements for in vitro studies of efficacy in the DTP screen and of in vitro human toxicity by PTS with a large majority of NCEs in the DTP pipeline. A large number of these formulated NCEs will also be suitable for intravenous and oral administration in animal models: BTB efficacy studies, BTB and TPB studies of PK and PD including validation of molecular PD assays by PADIS, and PTS assessment of toxicity via biomarkers (PTS) or clinical assessment. These preclinical formulations are intended to facilitate preclinical evaluation of developmental compounds, and are not necessarily the same as the formulated clinical product that may advance into clinical trials."

9568906,"Metabolomics plays an indispensable role in the growing systems biology approaches to identify reliable cancer biomarkers. Liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (LC-MS) and gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (GC-MS) have been extensively used for high-throughput comparison of the levels of thousands of metabolites among biological samples. However, the potential values of many disease-associated analytes discovered by these platforms have been inadequately explored in systems biology research due to lack of computational tools. Partly due to these limitations, poor reproducibility of previously identified metabolite biomarker candidates has been observed, especially when they are evaluated through independent platforms and validation sets. This project aims to address this challenge using a new software tool (SysMet) that utilizes network-based approaches for: (1) prioritizing putative IDs to assist in metabolite identification; (2) performing differential analysis to uncover relationships between disease and metabolites by investigating the rewiring and conserved interactions among metabolites in the progression of the disease; and (3) integrating metabolomic data with transcriptomic, proteomic, and glycomic data to identify highly promising metabolites as biomarker candidates. The tool will contribute to improving the ability of researchers to discover more reliable biomarkers by enhancing the role of metabolomics in systems biology research."

With a focus on scientific expertise, the DER also develops and supports extramural staff training while enhancing communication about standardized procedures, policies, methods, and approaches across the Institute.   There is a critical need in hastening our understanding of the placenta. Although the placenta is a short-lived organ, its importance is often underappreciated in being a crucial organ for the propagation of our species and future health of our progeny. The placenta is essential for the maintenance of pregnancy. The prominent function of the placenta is in the transfer of nutrients, gases and waste products between the mother and fetus. It is effectively the lung, gut, and kidney of the fetus. The placenta is also involved in the production of hormones that are involved in the maintenance of pregnancy and the initiation of labor. Another important function of the placenta is to act as a selective immunological barrier, so that the mother?s immune system does not attack the fetal allograft. Thus, perturbations in one of its many functions can have dire consequences for the fetus, ranging from intrauterine growth retardation to fetal death.  In contrast to many other research fields, there is a lack of any substantial internet based resources for hastening placental research. In the era of digital big data, enhanced internet tools for data centralization, cataloguing, integration and dissemination has resulted in a boon for all areas of science. Many entities have supported centralized internet resources, realizing the vast return on their investment. Examples of some large internet based resources supported by various NIH institutes include the NCBI databases, the Cancer Atlas and Brain Atlas. In contrast to many other research fields, there is a lack of any substantial internet based resources for hastening placental research.  The goal of the contract is to create a curated data set that will serve as a resource for placental research. It should be underscored that the solicitation is not to simply create a redundant resource of information, but rather to identify gaps in knowledge and explore and integrate the current foundation of knowledge that future pipelines of analysis would be built from.  This contract is the first step in an envisioned trajectory for reaching the ultimate goal of creating a comprehensive placental atlas that encompasses all the molecular regulatory pathways that drives both normal and abnormal placental development and function.  It is expected that the resource would be a particularly useful tool to identify research gaps, potential therapeutic targets for drug development, and potential biomarkers. The knowledge gained by completion of the atlas is anticipated to be invaluable for formulating effective molecular based interventions to improve pregnancy outcomes."

Select PACs have been associated with a wide range of toxicities (carcinogenicity, immunotoxicity, reproductive and developmental toxicity, neurotoxicity) and a complicated array of mechanisms of action. In particular, many PACs have been associated with suppression of humoral immune function and immunotoxicity has been identified as an informative parameter for estimating the carcinogenic potential of PACs. As part of the potential testing battery to predict mixture effects, we have examined the potential for individual PACs to modulate the antigen specific antibody response and affect bone marrow cytology.

9507735,"HIV-1 replication can be effectively suppressed in HIV infected patients using highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). However, despite effective suppressive therapy, HIV has been known to exist in a state of latency, with the best characterized latent reservoir being the resting memory CD4+ T cells. These resting cells produce HIV when their resting state is reversed following cellular activation. To achieve a cure for HIV disease, the latent reservoir of HIV needs to be identified and eliminated.  In order to evaluate the effectiveness of these strategies at clearing the latent reservoir, a reproducible assay capable of quantifying latent HIV is crucial. The best characterized assay today is the QVOA (Quantitative Viral Outgrowth Assay), also known as IUPM assay (Infectious Units Per Million) performed on highly purified resting CD4+ T cells under conditions that reverse latency and induce replication of HIV. However, QVOA measurements require large volumes of blood, are expensive, tedious, and labor intensive and therefore not the assay of choice for many laboratories conducting HIV eradication research.  NIAID has a requirement to provide the QVOA as a service to the HIV research community. This service will allow standardized QVOA measurements so that unbiased comparisons between different eradication strategies can be achieved. Widespread use of the assay will raise the standards for latent HIV detection and reduce the need for surrogate, less accurate assays, presently used by some laboratories."

9571325,"The B-WELL-Mom study aims to increase understanding of factors that predict poor asthma control during pregnancy as well as add to our knowledge of the basic immunology of pregnancy. Asthma is a common chronic disease and some women experience exacerbation and worsening of their asthma during pregnancy while others improve. Change in asthma severity/control in pregnancy has been noted frequently in the literature (about one-third worsen and one-third improve) but this change is not explored in any depth1. Patients with asthma may have a defect in regulatory T (Treg) cells, which favors further TH2-cell proliferation2. Treg cells are integral to the process by which the immune system differentiates foreign antigens (pathogens, etc.) and self antigens and, as such, they also play a key role in mediating pregnancy tolerance3. Treg can be measured in peripheral blood and the levels vary over the course of pregnancy and post-partum as well as across the menstrual cycle. Foxp3 is the primary gene responsible for Treg regulation. B-WELL-Mom investigates predictors of asthma control variability during pregnancy including demographic, biologic, genetic and environmental factors with particular interest in the role of maternal allergy. Pregnancy requires the immune system to tolerate the ?not self? fetus and the clinical presentation of asthma including improvement or worsening will contribute to knowledge of the basic immunology of pregnancy. Women who get worse during pregnancy may represent a vulnerable subgroup with respect to environmental exposures, such as poor air quality, which can exacerbate asthma and may have an independent effect on poor pregnancy outcomes."

9535670,"Project Summary Pneumonia is frequently associated with sepsis, a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, which is characterized by a non-resolving hyperinflammation. However, specific host components of the pulmonary milieu that regulate the intricate balance between perpetuation of inflammation and restoration of tissue homeostasis are not clearly understood. The complex process of resolution of inflammation is characterized by molecular and cellular events that orchestrate the removal of neutrophils by a process called efferocytosis. This process not only promotes anti-inflammatory and tissue-reparative response, but also negatively regulates granulopoiesis, all contributing to eventually regain a state of homeostasis. An understanding of these events is critical for developing effective prevention and/or treatment strategies for inflammatory immune disorders, including but not limited to sepsis. The long term goal of the proposed research is to characterize pulmonary innate immune components functioning in resolution of inflammation by using a pulmonary pathogen Klebsiella pneumoniae (KPn) which causes severe pneumonia characterized by a non-resolving neutrophilia and hyperinflammation culminating in development of sepsis. We have recently shown a protective role of C-type lectin receptor Clec4d in pneumonic infection with KPn. The Clec4d-/- mice are highly susceptible to an otherwise sublethal KPn infection and exhibit severe lung pathology with massive accumulation of neutrophils their lungs. Our preliminary results show that this excessive neutrophilia is also observed during sterile injury in Clec4d-/- mice indicating an important function of Clec4d in neutrophil clearance. Concomitantly, Clec4d-/- neutrophils, while fully capable of antimicrobial functions such as phagocytosis of bacteria and extracellular trap formation, are not efficiently efferocytized by macrophages, thus modulating the tissue reparative phenotype of macrophages and neutrophil homeostasis. Based on these observations, we hypothesized that Clec4d plays a protective role in pneumonic sepsis by facilitating neutrophil turnover which extinguishes inflammation. To elucidate the mechanism of protective function of Clec4d in this exploratory grant, we are proposing to: Aim 1: establish the role of Clec4d in regulating efferocytosis in-vitro and in-vivo during KPn infection; and Aim 2: To determine functional significance of Clec4d-mediated efferocytosis in resolution of inflammation and control of neutrophilia. The successful completion of these studies will improve our understanding of the role of innate immune components in resolution of inflammation and lead to future in-depth studies to understand the mechanistic underpinnings. This will have implications in finding successful therapies for various immune disorders such as sepsis as well as acute and chronic lung diseases, where unbridled inflammation is the root cause of disease."

9569762,"The Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) Study was initiated in 1985 with two components: community-based surveillance and a prospective cohort study. The community surveillance aimed to monitor trends in hospitalized myocardial infarction (MI), fatal coronary heart disease (CHD) in four U.S. communities: Forsyth County, NC; Jackson, MS; suburbs of Minneapolis, MN; and Washington County, MD. Surveillance for hospitalized heart failure (HF) events was added in 2005. The communities were selected to provide data across four (4) geographic locations with a range of mortality rates, in urban, suburban, and rural settings. The cohort study aimed to investigate the risk factors for and natural history of atherosclerosis and development of clinical atherosclerosis in middle-aged white or African American adults from the same communities. The study recruited in 15,792 white or African American participants initially aged 45-64 years and selected participants received triennial clinical exams over the first ten years of the study (1987-1989, 1990-1992, 1993-1995, and 1996-1998), with a fifth clinical exam in 2011-2013, providing a rich set of data on physical, behavioral, genetic, and psychosocial factors. Since 1988, the cohort has been contacted annually and in 2011 semiannual follow-up was initiated. Findings have been presented in over 1,400 publications as of 2014. Participants were examined for evidence of subclinical atherosclerosis using B-mode ultrasound in carotid and popliteal arteries, ankle-brachial index measurement, and retinal photography and, in subsets, abdominal aortic CT, and hemostatic factors; established and putative laboratory risk markers; socioeconomic, psychological, behavioral, and environmental characteristics; and genetic factors.

9576340,"Breast cancer remains the most frequently diagnosed female cancer, accounting for 23 % of the total cancer cases and 14% of the cancer deaths. Extensive research has been done for subtyping breast cancer at molecular and genetic level and to determine various clinical, pathological and molecular factors for selection of treatment modalities and prognostication of the disease at the diagnosis. Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a heterogeneous group of breast tumors simply defined by the absence of estrogen and progesterone receptors and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2, encompassing the molecular subtypes of basal-like and the more recently defined claudin-low group. TNBC accounts for 10?20 % of all invasive breast cancers and has been found to be associated with African American race, younger age, higher grade and mitotic index, and more advanced stage at diagnosis. In TNBC patients, the 5-year survival rate is much lower than other forms of breast cancer, and clearly, new approaches are needed to improve the clinical outcome for these patients.  Molecular analysis of tumors has identified many genes that are overexpressed in TNBC, which could be exploited as tumor antigens and potential vaccine candidates. Currently, the most common tumor antigens exploited in cancer immunotherapy are up-regulated self-proteins, such as HER2. While mutated epitopes are recognized as foreign ?neo-antigens? by the immune system eliciting Type I response, epitopes derived from non-mutated self-antigens are more likely to trigger Th2 polarizing cytokines such as IL-10 and IL-6 that inhibit CTL proliferation and function. Recently attempts have been made to identify Th1-selective epitopes from non mutated self-antigens that could elicit a ?neo-antigen? like response. The Th1-selective epitopes, when used in a vaccine, can elicit unopposed Type I immunity and are effective in preventing cancer growth in pre-clinical models. If Th2 inducing epitopes from the same protein are included in a vaccine, Th2 cells elicited by immunization will abrogate the anti-tumor effect of Th. Therefore, the vaccines composed only of Th1 inducing epitopes may allow unrestricted expansion of both Th1 and CTL. Th1 selective non-mutated antigen vaccines may be effective in preventing disease recurrence and progression. If the antigens are expressed early in oncogenesis, vaccines could have utility in prevention. Novel and more promising target antigens for preventive cancer vaccines may be identified from careful analyses of molecular alterations such as overexpressed genes in premalignant and/or malignant tissues discovered through the TCGA and other cancer genomics projects. Some of the genes overexpressed in premalignant and malignant lesions, but not in normal tissues, could be immunogenic and capable of eliciting protective anti tumor immune responses. High priority candidate genes can be selected from the list of overexpressed genes by employing a systematic approach, for example, based on differential expression patterns between premalignant or malignant lesions vs. normal tissues, functional roles in physiologic or oncogenic signaling pathways, and immunogenicity prediction and in vitro screening processes. Once candidate target proteins are selected, peptide based vaccines may be designed following the scoring methods developed by Disis et al. [5] and can be preclinically tested for in vivo immunogenicity and tumor preventive efficacy in relevant models. These kind of rational design strategies may help expedite the discovery and development of an efficacious cancer vaccine for prevention of various cancers including cancer of the breast."

9591663,"The ?3-D Retina Organoid'' Challenge (the ?Challenge''), is an ideation Challenge in which the National Eye Institute is asking for ideas to maximize the physiological relevance of 3-D human retina culture systems. Currently, retina culture models do not capture the complexity of the human retina. The goal of the Challenge is to transform innovative ideas into concrete concepts to develop new in vitro 3-D human retina models that recapitulate the organization and function of the human retina. NEI intends to follow this challenge with a follow-on but distinct Reduction to Practice Challenge, which will aim to invoke scientific and technological development of the model system. Technological breakthroughs in this arena could allow researchers and physicians to better understand, diagnose, and treat retinal diseases.   Around the world, an estimated 285 million people are visually impaired; of these, 39 million are blind. In many cases, blindness and vision loss are the result of retina-damaging diseases that, if better understood, could be treated or have interventions applied to stop degeneration or provide protection to remaining viable cells. One limitation in furthering research in this area is that eye tissue to study disease processes is not readily available. However, retina biology researchers have developed methods to grow 3-D retina models in vitro from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) and embryonic stem cells (ESC). Current protocols vary in their strengths and limitations, but none can robustly recapitulate the complexity and functionality of the retina. In this Challenge, NEI seeks concept solutions outlining methods and protocols to develop a 3-D human retina organoid prototype that is physiologically relevant. Protocols to develop such a model system could be transformational for vision research and regenerative medicine. New models could be used for applications such as understanding eye development, studying retinal biology, modeling diseases, identifying and testing treatments, and serving as a tissue source to use in transplantation. In this Challenge, the protocols to make models used for disease modeling and drug testing are desired, and solution(s) should yield protocols that allow reproducible culture of functionally-competent retina organoids. This Challenge will speed up the efforts toward this goal."

9430091,"The Biopharmaceutical Development Program (BDP) supports development, manufacturing, and testing of new concepts in cancer therapeutics based on biological agents and biological response modifiers. Located at the NCI-Frederick campus, the BDP uses leading-edge technologies for development of monoclonal antibodies, cytokines, immunotoxins and other recombinant proteins, peptide and DNA vaccines, virus vaccines and targeted cytolytic viruses, gene therapy products, and other biological agents. The BDP maintains Current Good Manufacturing Practices (CGMP)-compliant facilities that provide complete support from evaluation of manufacturing feasibility through process development and clinical manufacturing with all required regulatory documentation for proof of concept clinical studies. BDP is a major component of the research grant and contract program of the Biological Resources Branch, Developmental Therapeutics Program, Division of Cancer Treatment and Diagnosis, of the National Cancer Institute (BRB, DTP, DCTD, NCI).    During the 2008 Fiscal Year, the BDP released 22 manufacturing lots to support clinical trials or toxicological studies, and performed QC stability studies to support more than 40 other lots still in use. With a staff of 100 highly trained and experienced personnel, the BDP has undertaken over 100 projects since its inception, and over 60 of these have gone into clinical trials. BDP facilities are designed to be highly flexible, enabling work on multiple projects for a variety of different therapies. An innovative, dynamic program, the BDP mission is to concentrate on products that are in early development, beginning with demonstrating product feasibility, through to production of Phase I/II clinical supplies and complete testing.    In support of an NCI Immunotherapy Workshop initiative, BDP established a new cGMP manufacturing process for Interleukin-15. IL-15 from BDP is now in toxicological studies for the first clinical trial that is expected to start in FY09. In FY08, BDP also supported QC re-certification of Interleukin-12 that had been donated by the original manufacturer. IL-12 will be made available through a CTEP mechanism to qualified investigators for a number of new cancer immunotherapy and vaccine trials. Ad-CCL-21, another Immunotherapy agent manufactured by BDP, was shipped to two institutions for vaccine trials using chemokine gene-modified dendritic cells in advanced non-small lung cancer and malignant melanoma. In FY08, BDP released a clinical lot of Ad5-SSTR/TK.RGD a tropism modified adenovirus vector for an initial clinical trial in patients with ovarian cancer. Manufacturing and testing were completed for rRp450, a recombinant herpes virus, and an IND will be filed for treatment of patients with liver metastases. Ad-Delta-24-RGD is now in a clinical trial in patients with ovarian cancer and another trial in glioma. A second trial in glioma is in the process of regulatory filing. A BDP product that was released before FY08 is MR1-1, an immunotoxin that targets glioma. The first two patients were treated with MR1-1 during FY08. AdAFP and two plasmids targeting alpha-feto protein (AFP) entered a phase I clinical trial in hepatocellular carcinoma, and a second trial is pending at another institution. Ad5/3delta-24 was released and toxicological studies are underway for a Phase I clinical trial in ovarian cancer. During FY08, STAT3 decoy, an oligonucleotide targeting the STAT3 pathway of head and neck cancer entered a Phase?zero clinical trial. A previously released measles-based oncolytic virus, MV-NIS, that is already in a Phase I trial for multiple myeloma, entered a new Phase I clinical trial in ovarian cancer. The 11-1F4 project is an earlier RAID project for development of a chimeric antibody targeting amyloid deposits. In FY08, interesting imaging of amyloid deposits was achieved in initial patients entered on an imaging study using murine-11-1F4. The continued results in this study are being followed for leads in this challenging disease. Other BDP activities in FY08 supported development of many other new agents for clinical trials in patients with prostate cancer, ovarian cancer, glioma, cervical cancer, and lymphoma, among other cancer indications. Under the Economy in Government Act, BDP also performed reimbursed manufacturing activities for other institutes in support of clinical trials in Type I Diabetes and Malaria Vaccines. In these projects, BDP developed new expertise that will be directly applicable to projects coming into the BDP cancer ?pipeline.?    BDP saw some of its earlier products reaching FY08 clinical milestones beyond early Phase I/II studies. During FY08, BDP released several lots of HA-22, an immunotoxin in clinical trials in non-Hodgkins lymphoma. A commercial company has licensed this agent and will perform further manufacturing at their facilities. Hu14.18-IL2, a cytokine?antibody fusion protein that targets the GD-2 antigen on malignant melanoma and pediatric neuroblastoma is a ?legacy? BDP project for which multiple clinical lots have been manufactured. During FY08, Hu14.18-IL-2 entered combination clinical trials with an anti-angiogenesis agent, in melanoma patients with minimal residual disease. BDP is supporting technology transfer for further development at the commercial company holding the intellectual property. Another ?legacy? BDP project is a patient-specific Id vaccine for lymphoma that was licensed and taken over by a commercial company after BDP made over 100 patient-specific products for several early studies. In FY08, this vaccine completed a Phase III clinical trial in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and the company announced plans to discuss results with FDA.    FDA requires testing to demonstrate product stability during the planned administration of many BDP agents, because biologicals can be susceptible to degradation over time in interactions with various fluids, even plastic intravenous tubing. In FY08, BDP performed an increasing number of point-of-use studies for a variety of products, including monoclonal antibodies and viruses. These studies require a number of tests to validate the accuracy of these critical assessments of product quality during administration. In addition, BDP QC staff are collaborating directly with FDA investigators to improve in vitro adventitious virus assays for oncolytic viruses, a challenging safety issue in this field.    In FY 08, BDP made its established systems and experienced personnel available to provide assistance to other academic and government programs. BDP hosted visitors from outside U.S. institutions, other government agencies, and foreign countries, providing training on establishing other programs similar to the BDP.

9442390,"PROJECT SUMMARY:  Peripheral vascular disease (PVD, also known as Peripheral Arterial Disease, or PAD) is a common circulatory disorder directly caused by a reduction or complete occlusion of blood flow of artery the lower extremities (e.g., leg or feet). In 2013, about 8.5 million Americans aged ? 40 years are affected by PAD and associated with significant morbidity, mortality, and economic burden. Unfortunately, no effective cures are available for PVD. The present medical interventions include traditional drug treatment, physical therapy and/or surgical vessel graft, which is only able to temporally relieving the clinical symptoms and oftentimes, the limb ends up to be amputated when treatments are failed. Thus, it is in an urgent need to develop alternative strategies either to treat the damaged or to regenerate the lost limb. Here, we propose to pursue this by exploring a new role of Meis1 gene in regulating vascular remodeling using hindlimb ischemic mouse model. Meis1 (myeloid ecotropic viral integration site 1) gene belongs to the three amino-acid loop extension (TALE) subclass of homeobox gene families and it is a highly conserved transcription factor in all eukaryotes. Together with other homeobox factor, e.g., Hoxa9 and pre-B-cell leukemia homeobox 1 (Pbx1), Meis1 plays a crucial role in embryogenesis, hematogenesis, and embryonic angiogenesis during embryonic development, while in adult stage, Meis1 may involve homeostats, tumorigenesis, and cardiomyocytes proliferation. Up to date, little is known about the role of Meis1 in regulating arteriogenesis and angiogenesis under ischemic condition. Our preliminary study found that the endothelial cell (EC) specific knockout (KO) of Meis1 gene significantly increased blood flow of ischemic hindlimb in neonatal mice compared to wild type (WT) control. In addition, Meis1-KO also significantly attenuated necrotic/lost compared to control mice, suggesting that deletion of Meis1 gene in ECs provides significant protective effect against ischemia. Further analysis of vascular diameters implies that the improved blood flow in Meis-1 KO mice might be due to the enhanced arteriogenesis rather than angiogenesis. Taken together, we hypothesize that endothelial Meis1 gene negatively regulates arteriogenesis following hindlimb ischemia. Three Specific Aims are proposed to test the hypothesis: Aim 1 is to examine the temporospatial expression pattern of Meis1 gene in the nave, sham, and ischemic hindlimb during developmental stage. Aim 2 is to determine whether endothelial-specific deletion of Meis1 gene enhances arteriogenesis, angiogenesis, and blood flow of ischemic hindlimb in Meis1 KO mice. Aim 3 is to investigate whether administration of Meis1 inhibitors mimics the beneficial effects of Mei1 KO-promoted blood flow following hindlimb ischemia. Completion of these aims will provide a better mechanistic understanding of Meis1-regulated arteriogenesis and/or angiogenesis under ischemic condition. The results may also reveal a new potential therapeutic approach leading a new drug discovery and treatment of PVD."

9573287,"There is a demand for estrogen-free contraception in order to reduce the risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE), particularly for obese women. A new oral contraceptive agent consisting of a progesterone receptor modulator, which does not affect endogenous estrogen levels, has been developed. Ulipristal acetate (UPA) has been used in a single high dose for emergency contraception and has been used continuously for up to six months for treatment of uterine fibroids. Low dose continuous usage of oral UPA is anticipated to inhibit ovulation and provide an estrogen free, bleed free method of contraception.    The Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institutes of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) has a mission to develop safe and effective contraceptives for women, including obese women. Obesity is the number one public health issue facing the US population and is an independent risk for venous thromboembolism (VTE). Therefore, there is a public health need to develop effective contraception for woman that does not increase the risk of VTE. One Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved contraceptive method is the progestin-only pill (POP). This method requires strict adherence to taking the POP at the same time every day. The method is associated with irregular bleeding which often leads to discontinuation of the method. Daily low dose oral progesterone receptor modulators (PRMs), such as UPA, have been shown to inhibit ovulation and cause amenorrhea. The endogenous estrogen level is not affected by the PRM. Thus, the method will provide a regimen that is easier to follow than POP regimen and have a theoretically lower risk of VTE, especially for obese women. In addition, there is in vitro evidence that UPA may have protective activity against breast cancer. In order to provide preliminary evidence that daily, low dose UPA could be effective for contraception, a clinical trial will be conducted in the NICHD Contraceptive Clinical Trials Network (CCTN). The proposed study will be evaluated sequentially. Initially, women of reproductive age, with normal menstrual cycles, will receive treatment for 12 weeks (three 28-day cycles) in order to evaluate the mechanisms of contraceptive efficacy, safety and acceptability of this new contraceptive"

9424240,"A disproportionate number of new HIV infections occur in adolescent girls in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). In parts of western Kenya, HIV prevalence rises from 1.3% in 13-14 year-olds to 12.8% by age 18 years. Bacterial vaginosis (BV), which doubles the risk of HIV acquisition and transmission, affects 20-50% of general population women in SSA and Kenya. For adolescent girls, the HIV/STI epidemic overlaps with broader reproductive health concerns. Menstrual hygiene management (MHM) is a pervasive problem across low- and middle-income countries and a lack of MHM materials negatively impacts girls' health and schooling. To attend school and obtain necessities such as sanitary products, soap and underwear, girls consequently often engage in exchange sex. To tackle these challenges, Co-Investigator Phillips-Howard conducted a cluster randomized controlled feasibility study following 644 girls aged 14-16 years old: after one year, menstrual cup use resulted in 35% lower (p=0.034) BV prevalence and 52% lower (p=0.039) STI prevalence compared to control condition of menstrual hygiene counseling. Based on our and others' research, we hypothesize menstrual cups protect against STIs by preserving or promoting a Lactobacillus-dominant vaginal microbiome (VMB). Numerous studies associated a Lactobacillus-dominant VMB with reduced risk of STI and HIV acquisition. We propose to study this proposed microbiome-related mechanism to understand how menstrual cup use leads to reduced BV and STIs, and the effect of menstrual cup use on evolution of the adolescent VMB. We will: Aim 1: Determine the influence of menstrual cup use on the VMB and how this is related to risk of BV and STIs; Aim 2: Identify the change in VMB as girls initiate sexual activity, and whether this is modified by menstrual cup use, and Aim 3: Augment trial pharmacovigilance through detection of E. coli on cups and correlation with VMB. The proposed study will be a longitudinal sub-study of 440 girls aged 14-16 years nested within a recently funded cluster randomized controlled trial to examine menstrual cup use versus cash transfer or control condition among 3,864 secondary school girls in Siaya County, Kenya (DfID/MRC/Wellcome Trust; PI: Phillips-Howard). To achieve our aims, we will characterize the VMB using high throughput amplicon sequencing of portions of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene. Participants (220 cup users, 220 controls) will be asked to provide a self-collected vaginal swab at baseline prior to allocation and at each semi-annual visit, for a maximum of 6 samples per subject (BL, 6-, 12-, 18-, 24-, 30-months). BV will be assessed at baseline at each semi-annual visit, and STIs (C. trachomatis, T. vaginalis, N. gonorrhoeae) at baseline and annually. HIV and HSV-2 are assessed at baseline and annually by the larger trial. Results from this study will provide understanding of whether microbiome modulating interventions being tested for adult women are applicable for adolescent girls. Menstrual cups could be a low-cost, multipurpose intervention to add to the prevention toolkit not just for girls, but for sex workers and women at high risk for HIV and STIs."

The Division comprises three intramural research branches, Epidemiology, Biostatistics & Bioinformatics, and Health Behavior, and its mission is to design and implement original research with the potential for high impact findings for public health and its special populations. Accumulating evidence suggests that adverse intrauterine exposures may lead to permanent fetal adaptations that result in risk of disease later in life. Maternal obesity and gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) are exposures of particular interest. Thus, the goal of the proposed task order is to follow-up the offspring of an existing cohort of mothers to evaluate impacts of GDM and obesity on the metabolic, vascular, and reproductive health of the offspring, their determinants and the underlying molecular mechanisms. Data from mothers and fathers of the offspring will also be collected to better understand biological mechanisms and pathways. A hybrid design will combine new data collected in the present study with historical data that have been collected. Existing data for cohort mothers (ages 35-60) during the historical follow-up should at least include information on the diagnosis of GDM during the index pregnancy, information on other pregnancy complications, and of type 2 diabetes and related co-morbidities (including, but not limited to cardiovascular disorders), time of their diagnosis, other medical history, reproductive history, pregnancy history, diet and lifestyle factors before and/or during the index pregnancy, and after pregnancy, and anthropometric characteristics in the years after the index pregnancy. Existing data for the offspring (ages 13-35) during the historical follow-up should also include major developmental or chronic disorders (such as asthma and allergies), diet and lifestyle factors, and anthropometric characteristics. The overall study objectives are to recruit and enroll from each of the following 4 exposure categories: a) approximately 1510 offspring with a documented history of in utero GDM exposure, b) approximately 705 offspring of mothers who were overweight (BMl2_:25-29.9 kg/m2) during their pregnancy, c) approximately 705 offspring of mothers who were obese (BMl2_:30 kg/m2) during their pregnancy, and d) approximately 1780 unexposed offspring of mothers who were normal weight and did not have GDM during their pregnancy, as well as approximately 200 sibling groups discordant for GDM."

9448524,"PROJECT ABSTRACT The goal of this proposal is to connect the events of fetal germ cell development to the origin and inheritance of mutations in the Fmr1 locus, which are associated with Fragile X diseases. Evidence suggests that Fmr1 trinucleotide repeat expansions occur during development of germ cells, however the precise timing of Fmr1 repeat expansions, mechanism for intergenerational transmission, and function of the Fmr1 protein (FMRP) in this lineage remains unclear, as few studies have examined the entire pool of gametes or their precursors. Mouse models of Fmr1 deficiency as well as Fmr1-PM provide an opportunity to elucidate these mechanisms in development. Our preliminary data support a role for Fmr1 in protecting the genomic integrity of fetal germ cells and suggest that the period of scheduled apoptosis of fetal germ cells acts in divergent ways in the testis versus the ovary. The studies proposed here will test the overall hypothesis that the development of fetal germ cells provides a window of opportunity for Fmr1-PM amplifications based on the function of Fmr1 in genomic integrity, but on the other hand development selects against the intergenerational transmission of germ cells with amplifications in the male germline as compared to the female germline. Fragile X syndrome, along with other trinucleotide repeat diseases, has been called a `double-edged sword' because the pathological repeat expansion occurs in a gene required for DNA repair. In Aim 1, we will investigate the function of FMRP in protecting the integrity of developing germ cells and identify its RNA targets. Given the evidence that pathological CGG amplification occurs during Fmr1 transcription, these studies will provide critical insight into the periods of vulnerability to Fmr1 repeat amplification during germ cell development. Although the size of inherited Fmr1 pre-mutations increases with maternal age, this information is derived from successfully used oocytes, whereas nothing is known about the entire gamete pool. In Aim 2, we will test the hypothesis that FMRP1 increases fidelity of meiosis I in fetal oogonia whereas Fmr1 CGG repeat expansions interfere with meiosis and compromise the quality of oocytes in the adult. These studies will elucidate the relationship between Fmr1 pre-mutation, oocyte quality, and the dynamics of meiotic entry in the fetal ovary. In Aim 3 we will use both Crispr-based imaging and next generation sequencing to reveal the impact of massive waves of apoptosis that occur during normal male and female germ cell development on the diversity of repeat expansions in Fmr1 pre-mutation mice. These studies will provide insight into the developmental origin of pathological Fmr1 repeat expansions and potentially other mutations."
9571106,"There is a demand for estrogen-free contraception in order to reduce the risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE), particularly for obese women. A new oral contraceptive agent consisting of a progesterone receptor modulator, which does not affect endogenous estrogen levels, has been developed. Ulipristal acetate (UPA) has been used in a single high dose for emergency contraception and has been used continuously for up to six months for treatment of uterine fibroids. Low dose continuous usage of oral UPA is anticipated to inhibit ovulation and provide an estrogen free, bleed free method of contraception.   The Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institutes of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) has a mission to develop safe and effective contraceptives for women, including obese women. Obesity is the number one public health issue facing the US population and is an independent risk for venous thromboembolism (VTE). Therefore, there is a public health need to develop effective contraception for woman that does not increase the risk of VTE. One Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved contraceptive method is the progestin-only pill (POP). This method requires strict adherence to taking the POP at the same time every day. The method is associated with irregular bleeding which often leads to discontinuation of the method. Daily low dose oral progesterone receptor modulators (PRMs), such as UPA, have been shown to inhibit ovulation and cause amenorrhea. The endogenous estrogen level is not affected by the PRM. Thus, the method will provide a regimen that is easier to follow than POP regimen and have a theoretically lower risk of VTE, especially for obese women. In addition, there is in vitro evidence that UPA may have protective activity against breast cancer. In order to provide preliminary evidence that daily, low dose UPA could be effective for contraception, a clinical trial will be conducted in the NICHD Contraceptive Clinical Trials Network (CCTN). The proposed study will be evaluated sequentially. Initially, women of reproductive age, with normal menstrual cycles, will receive treatment for 12 weeks (three 28-day cycles) in order to evaluate the mechanisms of contraceptive efficacy, safety and acceptability of this new contraceptive."

9574794,"Lung Cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide. The most common form, Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), accounts for over 80% of lung cancer related deaths. In recent years, patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models have been established for various cancers and these models are increasingly used for preclinical studies of targeted therapies. Such studies highlight the ability of PDX models to better predict clinical tumor response compared to standard cell line-derived xenograft models. Furthermore, PDX models also provides the opportunity to tailor treatments to specific tumor genotypes/phenotypes. The latest therapeutic strategies only show a minimal increase in NSCLC survivorship of 5% greater 5-year survival rate. The majority of patients that receive first-line treatment are not good candidates for further chemotherapy due to disease progression, drug resistance, side-effects, severe toxicity and effects of comorbidity. The economic and survival rate impact of post first-line chemotherapy for NSCLC presents the crucial need to optimize the selection of initial chemotherapy regimen. Here we propose to develop and characterize at least 5 PDX lines from NSCLC tumors derived from minority populations. 20-40 tumor specimens obtained from patients that belong to Appalachian region, African descent, or Asian descent, will be transplanted into NOD-SCID mice and SRG rats, and serially transplanted for 4 generation (passages) to establish 5 NSCLC PDX lines that can be effectively grown in SCID rodents."

9571294,"Large scale genetic epidemiology studies are valuable to discover genetic risks to perinatal outcomes and to investigate gene-environment interactions in complex phenotypes. Availability of genome-wide data from well characterized cohorts opens new platforms to test several hypotheses and detect molecular mechanisms of adverse perinatal outcomes. However, some well-designed and phenotypically characterized perinatal epidemiology cohorts established before genomics was integrated into large scale epidemiological studies may not have stored buffy coat or whole blood samples that are known to yield high quality DNA for high throughput genotyping. Some of these well-designed cohorts have banked serum for a large number of participants, making them very attractive for large-scale genetic epidemiology studies provided adequate and good quality DNA can be obtained. One such prospective cohort is the Collaborative Perinatal Project (CPP). The CPP is a national birth cohort that enrolled pregnant women who presented for prenatal care at 12 US university hospital clinics between 1959 and 1966, and followed their offspring through age 7 years. Approximately 60,000 pregnancies of 48,000 women (46% White, 46.2% Black, 6.8% Puerto Rican, 1% others) and 59,000 children born to those women were enrolled [1]. Clinical and interview data are available on maternal conditions, obstetric complications and interventions, and offspring growth and developmental traits. Blood samples were collected for the vast majority of study participants, and sera isolated from blood samples of women, cord blood of newborns, and whole blood of selected offspring obtained at their 4 month pediatric examination are stored at -20C. The CPP serum bank is administered by the Division of Intramural Population Health Research (DIPHR) within the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD).  Provided usable amount and quality of DNA can be purified from the stored CPP sera, the available biobank data offers a new platform to test several biomedical research hypotheses. Specifically, the CPP offers unique opportunities to study genetic, evolutionary, maternal-fetal gene interactions, and gene-environment influences on gestational timing, fetal growth, health disparities, and neurodevelopmental disorders. Strengths of the CPP for such approaches include the hypothesis-free design of the study, the large number of good quality clinical and interview data, ethnic diversity of the samples, and availability of stored serum for a large number of subjects. In addition, the offspring for whom clinical data and biospecimens were collected at birth are now in their mid-50?s, and may be recruited to participate in future studies that aim to test several hypotheses to understand genetic mechanisms in the links between early growth/development and adult onset diseases including cardiometabolic disorders and mortality. Therefore, this task order aims to extract DNA from CPP serum samples stored for more than 50 years, restore damaged DNA, and evaluate genotyping performance in both genome-wide microarrays and real-time quantitative PCR assays."

9398914,"?     DESCRIPTION:          In this revised CDA-2 proposal, Dr. Orff proposes to study a behavioral therapeutic approach, Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (CBT-I) for veterans with a history of mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) and current insomnia.  There are three aims to this project: 1) determine the efficacy of CBT-I relative to Sleep Education in veterans with insomnia following mTBI; 2) evaluate sleep efficiency as a mediator of distal effects of CBT-I on symptoms of comorbid depression and PTSD and global functioning and disability; 3) examine the effects of moderator variables (e.g., depression, PTSD, physical pain) on CBT-I treatment outcomes.  Dr. Orff plans to enroll 70 OEF/OIF/OND veterans who, following baseline assessments, will be randomly assigned to six weeks of either CBT-I or Sleep Education.  The two conditions are matched appropriately for time and attention.  These patients will be followed over the six weeks and assessed for changes in sleep and other outcomes.          Applicant:          Dr. Henry Orff has a 1988 BA in Health and Society and Psychology from University of Rochester, a 2010 PhD in Clinical Psychology from SDSU/UCSD, and post-doctoral appointments.  He has been interested in sleep research since 1996 when he was a research assistant in a sleep lab.  He lists 23 publications, seven of which are first authored.  He was awarded a F31 NRSA pre-doctoral fellowship.  He is at the right point in his career to pursue this CDA-2 award.          Mentor/s:          The mentoring team is excellent and well suited for Dr. Orff's purposes.  All (except Dr. Golshan) are trained as clinical psychologists and all have written strong letters of endorsement.         Elizabeth Twamley, PhD, will be the primary mentor for randomized clinical trials and rehabilitation of veterans with mTBI.  She is Chief of the Neuropsychology Unit, Center of Excellence for Stress and Mental Health, and an Associate Professor of Psychiatry at UCSD.  She has developed and tested two interventions for veterans with TBI.  She is well funded and published and has good mentoring experience.  She will meet weekly with Dr. Orff and devote 5% time.          Philip Gehrman, PhD, will be the mentor for CBT-I and treatment fidelity.  He is the Director of the Behavioral Sleep Medicine Program at the Philadelphia VAMC and Assistant Professor of Psychology in Psychiatry at U. Penn.  He focuses on insomnia and is a national trainer for CBT-I.  He is well published and also has good mentoring experience.  He will meet with Dr. Orff by phone or skype and devote 5% time.          Amy Jak, PhD, will serve as the mentor for mTBI and neuropsychology.  She is the Director of TBI Cognitive Rehabilitation at the VA San Diego and an Assistant Professor of Psychiatry at UCSD.  She is the co-director of the UCSD/VA psychology internship program.  She is well published and has good mentoring experience.  She will meet with the candidate monthly and devote 5% time.          Sonia Ancoli-Israel, PhD., will serve as a mentor for behavioral sleep medicine and professional development.  She is Professor Emeritus of Psychiatry and Medicine at UCSD and Director of the Gillin Sleep and Chronomedicine Research Center.  She is certified in Behavioral Sleep Medicine.  She has had a distinguished career and will meet with Dr. Orff monthly.          Shahrokh Golshan, PhD, will provide biostatistics mentoring at 3% time.          Training Program:          Dr. Orff proposes a training program which will consist of clinical sleep training, TBI training, RCT training, and professional development training.  He will accomplish this through a combination of mentoring, coursework, and attendance at local conferences and national meetings.  These training goals and the approach described are appropriate.          Significance:          To date, there are no studies of CBT-I in this population.  Given the relatively high prevalence of  mTBI in younger veterans and the high co-occurrence of sleep disturbance with both mTBI and psychiatric disorders such as depression and PTSD, this is an important study that could potentially benefit many veterans in VA care.  Furthermore, it is a non-pharmaceutical approach, thereby offering an alternative to potentially harmful and addictive regimens.           Approach:          The approach is a sound one, and considerably improved compared with the previous application.  There are just a few issues that are troublesome.          1) Dr. Orff plans on randomizing subjects in order to keep the research assistant (who will be doing the evaluations) blind.  It is good that the research assistant will not be randomizing; however, ideally a third party (neither assessor nor interventionist) should be doing the randomization to ensure that there is no cherry picking of the subjects.     2) It was unclear who would deliver the control condition.  These individuals should be matched to the CBT-I interventionists as much as possible (e.g., education level, experience).       3) Please describe how the insomnia diagnosis (main study inclusion variable) will be made.          Environment:  The environment is excellent, especially the sleep lab which will be used for baseline and outcome assessments.           Feasibility:  There should be no problem recruiting the 70 veterans who will be enrolled in this study.            Dr. Orff is an excellent candidate for this CDA-2 award.  He has considerably improved this revised application and has assembled an outstanding mentoring team.  Given his extensive experience with sleep research, he is at the right stage of his career to pursue this award.          The aims of this study are straightforward, and the study design follows accordingly.  The four issues of concern are relatively minor and easily fixed.          Ethical/Safety Issues:          The applicant is willing to provide CBT-I to control patients without delay at the completion of their participation in the program.  While this is admirable and may help recruitment, it is not ethical to do so until after the results have been analyzed from all subjects.  It is presumptuous to assume that CBT-I will be superior to Sleep Education (after all, that's why the study is being conducted).           Clinical Relevance:          Insomnia and mTBI are common among younger veterans.  Improving sleep could have salutary effects on conditions that frequently co-occur with mTBI, such as PTSD and depression, as well as functioning and disability.  Additionally, as a non-pharmaceutical approach, it is likely safer than medications with no risk of addiction and fewer side effects.          Budget:  No concerns          Other Issues:  None"

9430063,"In Vivo Preclinical Support Laboratory - The In Vivo Preclinical Support group provides support to the Biological Testing Branch through its testing of potential anticancer agents in vivo. New agents submitted to the DTP are evaluated in the hollow fiber assay to assess their potential for in vivo activity using minimal amounts of test material as well as a minimal number of animals. Agents that are active in this assay are then tested in appropriate rodent tumor models (e.g., xenografts in immunodeficient mice or rodent tumors in syngeneic mice) where the route of administration, dose, and dose schedules are examined, in addition to the antitumor effect. Along with efficacy studies, this group provides support to the Phase 0 and CBC initiatives through evaluation of the pharmacodynamic (PD) effect of compounds on tumors growing in rodent species. This group is an integral part of the DTP anticancer drug development effort, the Phase 0 PD marker validation effort, and the CBC in vivo efficacy evaluation pathway.  Compound Formulation & Compound Screening - The Compound Formulation & Compound Screening group provides support to the Biological Testing Branch through its preparation of test agents for assessment in the in vivo efficacy models including the hollow fiber and xenograft studies. This group maintains an inventory of test agents and accurately weighs and solubilizes the test material for testing. In addition, they determine the solubility of test agents in proposed vehicles as needed. This group also provides the technical support for the new combination drug screening effort undertaken in 2008.

9589226,"NeuroAIDS-Moving forward: From pathogenesis to diagnosis  Despite increasing number of patients getting on ART, HIV-1 induced CNS dysfunction has persisted, making it critical to understand and tackle the CNS impairment caused by HIV. The phenotype of HIV induced CNS dysfunction has evolved over the past two decades with mild to moderate forms of disease affecting a significant number of HIV positive patients controlled on ART. The pathognomonic overt pathological signs of HIV induced CNS dysfunction such as encephalitis and neuronal death are no longer present as documented in key recent publications.   NeuroAIDS research is at an inflection point, with an urgent need to understand the mechanisms that cause and modulate the CNS impairment seen in the ART era together with examining whether current assessments accurately epitomize the etiology of impairment. With over half of the HIV-1 infected population in the US, being 50 years or older, it is also important to consider the role of factors such as co-morbidities, variable chronicity of infection; differences in cognitive reserve; legacy effects of improper suppression and several other viral, host and environmental influences in causing HIV-1 induced CNS dysfunction. Addressing the above complexities is the vital for the field to move forward as it impacts both pathogenesis and therapeutics research directions. Division of AIDS Research, NIMH intends to bring together Neuro-AIDS researchers from around the globe and plan to have presentations from different groups in US, Europe and several LMICs in addition to involving investigators outside the field of Neuro-AIDS to help the field better utilize the recent advances in neuroscience to decipher the pathogenesis of Neuro-AIDS.  This effort will help identify key scientific priorities for the field of Neuro-AIDS to move forward.  We envision this to be Multi-IC effort, involving OAR, NINDS, NIDA, NIA, NICHD and NIMH.

9533346,"The study aims to determine whether there are differences in health measures, particularly of cardio-metabolic risk, between children conceived by infertility treatment and children conceived naturally.  Children conceived by infertility include those born by assisted reproductive technologies (ART) and after non-ART treatments such as controlled ovarian hyperstimulation (COH) or ovulation induction (OI). Treatment effects could arise either from the process of ovulation stimulation (which may be shared by both ART and non-ART treatments) or in vitro culture (which only occurs in ART).  Epigenetics may be the mechanism underlying treatment effects. The study propose to continue the longitudinal follow-up of children (singletons and twins) from the Upstate New York Infant Development Screening Program (Upstate KIDS) from 6-8 years. This study will re-recruit participants from t original Upstate KIDS cohort; approximately 1100 children (singletons or twins) conceived by infertility treatment and 2100 children conceived naturally.

Towards this end LSC will focus its activities on lead optimization, an essential and integral part of new drug discovery and development. Novel synthetic methodologies will be developed to create new analogs based on the effective lead compounds to improve pharmaceutical profiles by addressing the following drug properties: activity, tumor selectivity, solubility, bioavailability, stability and ADME/PK in an iterative fashion. The laboratory is engaged in developing new relevant synthesis methodologies for applications by the wider extramural community, especially those funded by DCTD.  Most recently, DCTD in conjunction with the Center for Cancer Research and the Office of the Director, NCI established a new program called the Chemical Biology Consortium (CBC) to facilitate the discovery and development of new agents to treat cancer. The CBC is expected to be an integrated research consortium at the cutting edge of chemical biology and molecular oncology that will work with various programs within NCI and outside scientific community, establish an iterative cancer drug discovery group on the scale of a small biotechnology concern, and advance new cancer therapy into the clinic. The goal of the CBC is to focus on unmet therapeutic needs in oncology that are not currently addressed by the private sector, including the pharmaceutical industry. To address this challenge and to re-establish NCI as a major player in the national cancer therapeutic arena, successful interaction of CBC Screening and Chemistry centers and other scientific groups is necessary. To achieve this goal, the LSC has become the CBC Chemistry support center that will interact with various DCTD centers and programs within NCI and outside contractor laboratories to facilitate the identification of new drug discoveries through medicinal chemistry with the ultimate goal of developing new clinical candidates."

The primary focus of the TARGET and CGCI Initiatives remain identifying genomic alterations that offer pathways to novel therapeutic interventions that may lead to more effective treatments for cancers.  NCI-CBIIT provides informatics support for the OCG programs. The Therapeutically Applicable Research to Generate Effective Treatments (TARGET) Initiative focuses to rapidly identify potential therapeutic targets in childhood cancers so that new, more effective treatments can be developed in shorter time and ultimately bring new hope to children and their families who face the devastating burden of these diseases. The TARGET Initiative (is focused on identifying therapeutic targets as well as prognostic and diagnostic markers in multiple childhood cancers.  The initiative includes the study of high-risk Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL), neuroblastoma (NBL), high-risk and treatment refractory Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML), osteosarcoma (OS), and kidney tumors (including high risk Wilms tumor).  These cancers were the chosen for study because of their prevalence among children, the inadequacy of current treatment options, the ongoing NCI-supported efforts to molecularly characterize these cancers, and the availability of clinically annotated, high-quality human tissue collections that met TARGET's strict scientific, technical, and ethical requirements.  In the coming year, TARGET will include validation cohorts and other studies.   The Cancer Genome Characterization Initiative (CGCI) supports cutting-edge genomics research on rare cancers. Researchers develop and apply advanced sequencing and other genome-based methods to identify novel genetic abnormalities in tumors. The extensive genetic profiles generated by CGCI may inform better cancer diagnosis and treatment. CGCI is another OCG program. CGCI focuses Burkitt Lymphoma and HIV+ Tumor Molecular Characterization Project (HTMCP).  Previous projects included early stage Lung Cancers, Medulloblastoma, and Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma. The goal of the Burkitt Lymphoma Genome Sequencing Project (BLGSP) is to explore potential genetic changes in patients with Burkitt lymphoma that could lead to better prevention, detection, and treatment of this rare and aggressive cancer. The OCG, along with the Office of HIV and AIDS Malignancies (OHAM), initiated the HTMCP to gain insight into the genetic events driving HIV-associated cancers and to determine why certain cancers, but not others, have higher incidences in HIV-positive patients. The data generated by these projects are stored at the DCC. Cancer Target Discovery and Development (CTD) initiative bridges the gap between the enormous volumes of data generated by genomic characterization studies and the ability to use these data for the development of human cancer therapeutics. It specializes in computational and functional genomics approaches critical for translating next-generation sequencing data. The Cancer Target Discovery and Development (CTD2) initiative is a collaborative network of OCG-supported Centers. The program strives to functionally validate discoveries from large-scale genomic initiatives and advance them toward precision medicine through the efforts of the Centers and open access data sharing.  Through cross-Network collaborations, CTD2 uses innovative bioinformatics and functional biology to: (1) mine data to find alterations that potentially influence tumor biology, (2) characterize the functional roles of candidate alterations in cancers, and (3) identify novel approaches that target causative alterations either directly or indirectly.  Because CTD2 is a ?community resource project all information in the Data Portal is openly available to the scientific community and can be accessed without restrictions.  Project descriptions, datasets, and methodologies generated by the Centers are shared through the CTD2 Data Portal (i.e. the OCG Data Coordinating Center).  OCG oversees other genomics and translation projects which may generate molecular data that will be stored in the DCC.  The formats, file types etc. is ever changing and the DCC evolves as needed.  It is expected that the infrastructure already developed and being developed will be useable for the OCG data generated. The research conducted by OCG programs is divided into three distinct yet tightly integrated components that together form a system for selecting new molecular targets for the development of novel therapies for these childhood cancers:  ? Genomic Characterization: Using high-resolution array-based methods a)determine differences in the patterns of gene expression in cancer samples and non-cancerous samples and b) genome changes to characterize genome structural changes that correlate with each cancer, such as chromosome region gains and losses, methylation changes etc. are integrated to provide a complete genomic overview of each cancer.  ? Sequencing: Up-to-date genetic sequencing techniques are used to read genes that have been identified to have altered expression and/or structural alterations to identify the specific cancer-related mutations in the DNA sequence.  Additionally, new technologies to sequence the whole-genome, whole-exome, RNA-seq, and miRNA-seq have and will be employed. ? Identification of Therapeutic Targets?For example, RNA interference (RNAi), small molecule high-throughput screens are used to identify and initially validate potential targets identified from the genomic characterization and re-sequencing efforts.  In the future, other approaches may be added."
9556092,"THE SISTER STUDY We will study environmental and genetic risk factors for breast cancer in a cohort of 50,000 sisters of women who have had breast cancer. In the United States, there were approximately 192,000 new cases of breast cancer in 2001, with more than 200,000 cases expected in 2002. Breast cancer accounts for over 30% of all new cancer cases among women and 15% of cancer deaths. The etiology of breast cancer is complex, with both genetic and environmental factors playing a role. By focusing on a genetically susceptible group, more precise estimates of the contribution of environmental and other non-genetic factors to disease risk may be possible. The cohort will be followed actively for the development of breast cancer and other diseases. We expect, on average, 300 new cases of breast cancer to be diagnosed each year in a cohort of 50,000 sisters aged 35-74 years. Thus, after five years of follow-up, we will have sufficient power, with about 1,500 new breast cancer cases, to address many key hypotheses regarding gene-environment interactions. Baseline questionnaires, banked blood, urine, and toenail samples, as well as banked environmental samples will provide a rich resource for testing current and future hypotheses regarding breast cancer risk. Follow-up questionnaires will update exposure and medical histories as well as provide an opportunity to collect new data and environmental samples to evaluate emerging hypotheses. Nested case-control or case-cohort analyses will be carried out among sisters who develop cancer and a sample of those who do not, to assess specific gene-environment interactions. Once assembled, the cohort also will provide the structure for assessing gene-environment interactions in risk for other diseases and will provide opportunities for add-on studies. THE TWO-SISTER STUDY We also will enroll 1,600 sisters recently diagnosed with breast cancer, who were under 50 when diagnosed, and whose sister is a Sister Study participant. We will collect DNA from the affected sister and from their parents, creating a nuclear family foursome or ?tetrad.?

MP drugs also pose a lower risk of toxicity effects from skin contact vs. liquid formulations, to patients and caregivers. A major hurdle to the use of MP drugs is the lack of precision delivery and dosing systems. HS Design proposes to develop prototype systems that can accurately measure and dose MP drugs in volumes suitable for cancer treatment. HSD will take a platform approach so the system can be tailored for a variety of pediatric cancer drugs that already have oral formulations are could soon be approved for oral use. At the end of Phase 1 prototypes will have been tested for dose accuracy and usability."

9576432,"Radiation therapy has been a critical part of our approach to cure cancer for almost 100 years. While the technology for radiation delivery has dramatically improved, the ability to personalize radiation treatment based on baseline, genetic differences between patients, has not yet been applied to direct therapy. We have discovered that inherited, germline DNA biomarkers, disrupting microRNA regulatory networks, act as biomarkers of the radiation response, predicting toxicity and the radio-immune response. In this proposal, we will further validate and refine this panel of biomarkers for each of the key radiation endpoints - normal tissue toxicity, tumor control and the radio-immune response. We will use prospectively collected samples from a large clinical patient population treated with current radiation techniques, as well as a Phase I/II trail incorporating anti-PD-L1 therapy with radiation. By the end of this contract, we will have a fullyvalidated panel of biomarkers that can be applied as a test to direct radiation therapy, to minimize toxicity and enhance the potential of radiation to cure cancer. Radiation treatment is a cornerstone of our battle against cancer, and allowing the optimal use of this powerful treatment for each individual patient will have a very broad impact on human health."
9435820,"ABSTRACT  HTLV-1 is a complex human delta retrovirus that infects 10-20 million people worldwide. While HTLV-1 infection is generally asymptomatic, 3-5% of infected individuals develop a highly malignant T cell neoplasm known as adult T cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATL) decades after infection. How HTLV-1 infection progresses to ATL is not well understood. Two viral regulatory proteins, Tax and HBZ, encoded by the sense and antisense viral transcripts respectively are thought to play indispensable roles in the oncogenic process. Tax potently activates viral transcription and I-?B kinase (IKK)/NF-?B . The latter activity is thought to drive T-cell transformation and ATL development. Paradoxically, we have found that hyperactivation of NF-?B by Tax induces a rapid cellular senescence response (Tax-IRS) mediated by two cyclin?dependent kinase inhibitors, p21CIP1/WAF1 and p27KIP1. HTLV-1 infection in culture also leads mostly to senescence. Tax-IRS, we think, constitutes a safeguard against potentially oncogenic NF-?B dysregulation. Our recent findings support the notion that escape from Tax-IRS is critical for the clonal expansion of HTLV-1-infected T cells, which invariably precedes and is requisite for ATL emergence. Importantly, a recent whole-genome analysis of ATL has revealed recurrent activating (ATLA) point mutations in key mediators of the T cell receptor and CD28 co- stimulatory signaling pathways. We hypothesize that many of the ATLA mutations are cancer-initiating and occur first in uninfected T cells where they down-regulate p21CIP1/WAF1 and p27KIP1 via IKK/NF-?B-unrelated pathways, thus preventing Tax-IRS to allow HTLV-1-infected T cells to proliferate. They likely also act in concert with HTLV-1 to immortalize/transform T cells. In agreement with the notion that ATL cells are descended from T cells harboring Tax-IRS-preventing somatic mutations, re-introduction and re-expression of tax in ATL cell lines no longer trigger a senescence response. ATL cells are characterized by the surface expression of CD4 and CD25. Many ATL cells also express Foxp3, the master transcription factor that specifies the lineage and development of the regulatory T cell  Foxp3 potently represses the activities of many cellular transcription factors including NF-?B, NFAT, Runx1, ROR?T, and CREB involved in T cell activation. As the transcriptional activity of NF-?B drives senescence induction, we tested the possibility that Foxp3 may mitigate Tax-IRS to favor clonal expansion of infected T cells. Indeed, our preliminary results indicate that ectopic expression of Foxp3 does facilitate the subset. proliferation of HTLV-1-infected T cells. Here we propose to investigate the underlying causes for the clonal expansion of HTLV-1-infected T cells in two specific aims: (1) To determine whether ATL-specific activating (ATLA) mutations facilitate clonal expansion and transformation of HTLV-1-infected T cells. (2) To determine the role of Foxp3 in the proliferative expansion of HTLV-1-infected T cells."
9576431,"This objective of this contract is to support a new trial aimed at evaluating the non-inferiority of 1 versus 2 doses of the HPV vaccines and an additional extension to the follow-up of women in NCI?s ongoing Costa Rica Vaccine Trial (CVT) (which initially followed women for 10 years and will now extend that follow up out to 15 years among a subset of participants). CVT showed similar HPV vaccine efficacy over four years among women who received one, two and three doses of the HPV16/18 vaccine, and stable antibody responses have been observed throughout the seven years of follow-up accrued to date in CVT. Following up on these discoveries and further documenting the protection afforded by fewer doses could result in a monumental, global public health breakthrough."

The Repository of Mouse Models for Cytogenetic Disorders (Mouse Repository) began in the 1970s to generate and distribute mouse models for cytogenetic disorders, with special emphasis on Down syndrome (DS; trisomy 21).  The creation of mouse models relevant to DS began in the 1970s and continued with the demonstration  of genetic synteny between a segment of mouse chromosome 16 (Mmu16) and human chromosome  21 (Hsa21 ), which led to the use of the trisomy 16 mouse (Ts16) as a model for studies relevant to DS.  Genes present on Hsa21 were localized to mouse chromosomes 17 and I 0 (Mmu17 and Mmu l 0) as well.  Pattial trisomies for a number of syntenic chromosomal segments were generated in the 1980s, under contract to NICHD.  One of these partial trisomies, designated Ts65Dn, proved to include approximately 150 genes located in what is considered the Down syndrome critical region of Hsa21. Subsequently, these mice were produced and distributed, under an NICHD contract, to investigators approved for receipt of them by NICHD.  During the last 22 years, various investigators have generated other models relevant to DS.  These include, but are not limited to, TslCje, Ts2Cje, TslRhr, MslRhr, Tel, and others.  When these strains and stocks have been made available to the research community, the creation of a central repository has ensured their maintenance on appropriate genetic backgrounds and their distribution to investigators upon request in a timely manner and subsequent to approval by NICHD. Many of these mouse strains are maintained under cryopreservation. In 2010, the NICHD reissued the contract A Repository of Mouse Models of Cytogenetic  Disorders with a substantial increase in investment to ensure timely access to and increased availability of mouse models for cytogenetic disorders, particularly Ts65Dn, to the research community, and to ensure increased experimental efforts to modify the existing genetic backgrounds for the various strains to increase availability and ease of use by investigators.

9581254,"Summary  Myocardial catheter ablation is commonly performed for the treatment of rhythm disorders, using radiofrequency energy, typically guided using X-ray and/or electromagnetic positioning. Available non-surgical technologies do not allow clear depiction of myocardium being ablated. MRI-guided needle catheter chemo-ablation, for example using focal injection of caustic agents such as acetic acid doped with MRI contrast agents, may allow targeted disruption of small segments of myocardium in the treatment of rhythm disorders such as ventricular tachycardia and in the treatment of structural heart disease such as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Preclinical feasibility of at least two different MRI injection needle catheter systems has been demonstrated and published for the application of direct endomyocardial cell injection, including by our labs. No commercial options are available. An MRI myocardial needle injection catheter system may enable a new family of non-surgical cardiovascular treatments for rhythm and structural heart disease.  Project Goals  The goal of the project is to develop an endomyocardial injection needle chemoablation catheter that is safe for operation during MRI, to allow targeted myocardial delivery of caustic agents. First a prototype would be developed and tested in animals, and ultimately a clinical-grade device would undergo regulatory development for clinical testing.

The study recruited in 15,792 white or African American participants initially aged 45-64 years and selected participants received triennial clinical exams over the first ten years of the study (1987-1989, 1990-1992, 1993-1995, and 1996-1998), with a fifth clinical exam in 2011-2013, providing a rich set of data on physical, behavioral, genetic, and psychosocial factors. Since 1988, the cohort has been contacted annually and in 2011 semiannual follow-up was initiated. Findings have been presented in over 1,400 publications as of 2014. Participants were examined for evidence of subclinical atherosclerosis using B-mode ultrasound in carotid and popliteal arteries, ankle-brachial index measurement, and retinal photography and, in subsets, abdominal aortic CT, and hemostatic factors; established and putative laboratory risk markers; socioeconomic, psychological, behavioral, and environmental characteristics; and genetic factors. Examinations included a variety of components, with a grant-funded detailed cognitive function testing component added in the most recent exam."
9434110,"PROJECT SUMMARY Autoimmune diseases are a major public health concern. Autoimmunity results from an inappropriate immune response to one's own tissue and there is evidence that it can be triggered by exposure to exogenous, potentially immunogenic agents. In such cases, these agents activate and select auto-reactive B cells and/or overcome normal immune tolerance mechanisms that keep auto-immunity in check. Idiopathic immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is an autoimmune disease in which environmental immunogens (viruses, bacteria, drugs and others) have been implicated in pathogenesis. However an understanding of the molecular basis for how exogenous agents select for and induce expansion of self-reactive B cells is limited. Alloantigens expressed on blood cells are usually defined by single amino acid polymorphisms in membrane glycoproteins. Exposure to alloantigens by transfusion or pregnancy can lead to induction of alloantigen- specific alloantibodies. In the alloimmune response, B cells are selected for binding to an epitope consisting of a single antigen-defining, polymorphic amino acid (AA) and other adjacent non-polymorphic AA residues. Following B cell activation, and with T cell help, B cell receptors (BCR) undergo somatic hypermutation, which randomly alters the AA composition of their complementarity-determining regions (CDR). It is likely that this process sometimes alters specific contact amino acids of the CDR in such a way that specificity for the polymorphic AA is lost and binding to non-polymorphic AAs of the target glycoprotein is enhanced, creating an antibody that is auto-reactive. In post transfusion purpura (PTP), a patient becomes profoundly thrombocytopenic following a blood transfusion in association with production of high titer alloantibodies. How an alloantibody that is incapable of recognizing patient platelets causes thrombocytopenia in PTP is unknown. We have evidence that an autoantibody produced concomitantly with the alloantibody is the actual cause of autologous platelet destruction and have developed a mouse model involving cross-strain platelet immunization that mimics PTP. I propose to use this model to characterize the molecular basis for realignment of an immune response from allo- to auto-reactive. Findings made are expected 1) to clarify the pathogenesis of PTP and a similar phenomenon seen in patients producing allo-antibodies specific for RBCs; 2) to lay a groundwork for further studies of human disorders associated with allo-immunity and; 3) to establish a basis for future studies of autoimmunity resulting from immunization to exogenous agents."
9495650,"This genetic toxicology testing contract has supported the overall mission of NTP to provide detailed toxicological profiles, including potential for carcinogenicity, of compounds of interest for 31 years.  This Genetic Toxicity Testing contract provides information on exposure-related genetic damage to NTP using standard tests as well as innovative protocols when necessary. The capabilities of the contract are continuously updated to remain current and compatible with international guidelines for conducting these kinds of tests. Testing systems employed include both in vitro (animal cell-based and bacterial) and in vivo (rats and mice) assays. In vivo studies using human blood samples can also be conducted to translate findings from animal studies to human exposure scenarios. Three main tests are conducted routinely: in vitro bacterial mutagenicity assays, in vivo rodent peripheral blood micronucleus (MN) assays, and in vivo rodent DNA damage (Comet) assays in multiple tissues including, for example, liver, brain, stomach, kidney, and lung. Using peripheral blood as the sample source, MN and Comet studies can also be conducted in humans. In addition, in vitro MN assays have become increasingly used as a substitute for stand-alone in vivo rodent MN assays. An animal mutation endpoint that holds promise for application in human clinical and biomonitoring studies in the future, is now routinely assessed in the testing laboratory: the pig-a mutation assay (phosphatidylinositol glycan anchor biosynthesis, class A gene). Mutations in this gene are easily detected in red blood cell samples from laboratory rodents, and updated methods to streamline the assay have been developed, so that integration into existing toxicity tests can easily be accomplished. We have started to multiplex this assay with the in vivo MN and Comet assays, increasing the genetic damage information we obtain from test animals to provide an even more comprehensive profile of the genetic toxicity potential of a chemical. In addition to our cell-based and animal model studies, human blood samples provided by collaborators such as NIOSH and the NIEHS Clinical Research Unit may also be examined for specific genetic endpoints following an environmental exposure that is suspected of inducing genetic damage, or has been shown to do so in NTP animal studies. The number of studies of each type described above varies annually, depending on the needs of the NTP. Historical control data bases have been established for MN and pig-a data from a new strain of mouse ? the CD-1 mouse ? that is used in NTP reproductive (transgenerational) studies. In addition, a pig-a historical control database has been established for the Sprague Dawley rat model in these same types of studies. We now are able to place our rat pig-a and our CD-1 mouse MN and pig-a data into context, which is necessary for the interpretation of the observed responses."

9430178,"Abstract - As the SEER programs continue to expand (in quality, expanded outcomes collection, and utilization) it is critical to establish a model and a set of processes for ensuring confidence and trust in the use and application of the SEER data.  This is particularly critical as SEER approaches potential opportunities to: 1) integrate new technologies to curate date (e.g., NLP), 2) improve quality and efficiency of existing platforms, 3) expand the scope of data collection (e.g., Residual Tissue Repository), and 4) foster new partnerships with other organizations (e.g., commercial pharmacy chains)."
9576329,"Bladder cancer ranks as the ninth most frequently-diagnosed cancer worldwide, with the highest incidence rates observed in men in Southern and Western Europe, North America, as well as in certaincountries in Northern Africa or Western Asia. Incidence rates are consistently lower in women than men, although sex differences varied greatly between countries. Even though 70 to 80% of patients are diagnosed with superficial disease, bladder cancer has a high overall rate of recurrence at approximately 65%. Since the pioneering work of Morales et al. in 1976, intravesical BCG has been the standard-of-care immunotherapy for superficial bladder cancer. BCG immunotherapy results in 70?75% and 50?60% complete response rates for carcinoma-in situ and small residual tumors, respectively. Unfortunately, a significant percentage of patients will fail initial BCG therapy and approximately 30?50% of BCG responders will develop recurrent tumors within 5 years [4, 5]. Therefore, despite the effectiveness of BCG, additional therapies are needed to limit recurrence and improve survival for both BCG responders and non-responders. Evaluation of the genomic data of bladder cancer has shown that about half of patients as having highly mutated tumors [6]. While other tumors have a lower mutational burden, these can be characterized by dozens of gene amplifications. Both mutated proteins and overexpressed proteins can be exploited as tumor antigens and potential vaccine candidates. Currently, the most common tumor antigens exploited in cancer immunotherapy are up-regulated self-proteins, such as HER2. While mutated epitopes are recognized as foreign ?net-antigens? by the immune system eliciting Type I response, epitopes derived from non-mutated self antigens are more likely to trigger Th2 polarizing cytokines such as IL-10 and IL-6 that inhibit CTL proliferation and function. Recently attempts have been made to identify Th1 selective epitopes from non-mutated self-antigens that could elicit a ?neo-antigen? like response. The Th1 selective epitopes, when used in a vaccine, can elicit unopposed Type I immunity and are effective in preventing cancer growth in pre-clinical models. If Th2 inducing epitopes from the same protein are included in a vaccine, Th2 cells elicited by immunization will abrogate the anti-tumor effect of Th1. Therefore, the vaccines composed only of Th1 inducing epitopes may allow unrestricted expansion of both Th1 and CTL. Th1 selective non-mutated antigen vaccines may be effective in preventing disease recurrence and progression. If the antigens are expressed early in oncogenesis, vaccines could have utility in prevention. Novel and more promising target antigens for preventive cancer vaccines may be identified from careful analyses of molecular alterations such as overexpressed genes in premalignant and/or malignant tissues discovered through the TCGA and other cancer genomics projects. Some of the genes overexpressed in premalignant and malignant lesions, but not in normal tissues, could be immunogenic and capable of eliciting protective antitumor immune responses. High priority candidate genes can be selected from the list of overexpressed genes by employing a systematic approach, for example, based on differential expression patterns between premalignant or malignant lesions vs. normal tissues, functional roles in physiologic or oncogenic signaling pathways, and immunogenicity prediction and in vitro screening processes. Once candidate target proteins are selected, peptide based vaccines may be designed, and can be preclinically tested for in vivo immunogenicity and tumor preventive efficacy in relevant models. These kind of rational design strategies may help expedite the discovery and development of an efficacious cancer vaccine for prevention of various cancers including cancer of the bladder."
9457206,"The objectives of the REDS-III program are to ensure safe and effective blood banking and transfusion medicine practices through a comprehensive, multi-targeted strategy involving basic, translational, and clinical research to improve the benefits of transfusion while reducing its risks. Improving blood component safety and availability in the U.S. and internationally through the conduct of epidemiologic, survey, and laboratory studies is the cornerstone of the REDS program. Transfusion therapy is the most commonly employed, and, arguably, one of the least understood medical procedures in the U.S. affecting about five million recipients annually. This research program is not only critical to public health in the U.S. but also to countries struggling with the HIV epidemic where blood safety and availability are major concerns. The REDS-III program is comprised of one Data Coordinating Center (DCC), one Central Laboratory, four domestic hubs, and three international collaborative programs involving U.S. investigators and investigators at international blood centers. The REDS-III program will target the following blood banking and transfusion medicine areas: donor targeted strategies; blood banking; transfusion practices in adult patients; and education and training."
9570538,"To provide a platform suitable for purification of tumor-derived vesicles and to separate them from other tissue-derived vesicles in biofluids, we propose a two-step approach: 1) Aethlon Medical?s Hemopurifier device for isolation of the total exosome population from biofluids such as plasma. This affinity biofiltration technology employs hollow-fiber hemofiltration cartridges (average 200 nm pores) containing the lectin Galanthus nivalis agglutinin (GNA) as an affinity agent, which has been leveraged for capture of a broad spectrum of viruses of similar sizes and high mannose-glycoprotein surfaces as exosomes. This clinically-used device has been scaled down to a bench-top version capable of filtering large volumes of complex biofluids, thereby overcoming limitations of current exosome isolation techniques. 2) Magnetic immunocapture of tumor exosomes using the mAb 225.28 recognizing an epitope of chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan 4 expressed on tumor exosomes. The Co-Investigators, Drs. Whiteside and Ferrone, have demonstrated the ability to perform magnetic isolation of melanoma exosomes using mAb 225.28. By leveraging a device platform specialized for rapid processing biofluids followed by immunocapture with mAb 225.28, the proposed work aims to standardize an exosome isolation method from complex biofluids that will be suitable for automated workflows in research and clinical care."

9581256,"Summary  New treatments are needed for severe asthmatics who do not respond to standard therapy with inhaled steroids, especially those with a ?type 2 low? phenotype, such as individuals with neutrophil-predominant inflammation. This solicitation is for the development and early commercialization of an inhalational formulation of the 5A apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I) mimetic peptide that can be administered to asthmatic subjects in Phase I clinical trials and subsequently developed into a new treatment for severe asthma.   ApoA-I is the major protein component of high-density lipoproteins, which mediates reverse cholesterol transport out of cells by interacting with the ATP-binding cassette subfamily member 1 (ABCA1). ApoA-I also has anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant, and immunomodulatory properties. NHLBI investigators have shown that systemic administration of the 5A apoA-I mimetic peptide, which is a bi-helical peptide that recapitulates the ?-helical structure of apoA-I and mediates reverse cholesterol transport out of cells by interacting with ABCA1, attenuates the induction of airway inflammation, mucous cell metaplasia, and airway hyperresponsiveness in house dust mite (HDM)-challenged mice. In addition, they have shown that apoA-I has a protective effect in allergic asthma. Apoa1-knockout mice, which were sensitized and challenged with ovalbumin (OVA), have increased neutrophilic airway inflammation that was primarily mediated by increased G-CSF expression, with associated increases in type 1 (IFN-?, TNF-?) and Th17 (IL-17A) cytokines. The increased neutrophilic airway inflammation in the OVA-challenged Apoa1-knockout mice was inhibited by intranasal administration of the 5A apoA-I mimetic peptide. Lastly, serum apoA-I levels are positively correlated with FEV1 in atopic asthmatic subjects, which suggests that circulating apoA-I may improve airflow obstruction. These murine and human translational studies serve as the conceptual basis for developing the 5A apoA-I mimetic peptide into a novel inhalational treatment for severe asthma.  Project Goals  The overall goal of this project is to prepare, in both manufacturing processes and preclinical evaluation, an inhalational 5A apoA-I mimetic peptide that will be the subject of a future Investigational New Drug (IND) application to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) focused on the treatment of type 2 low phenotype asthma patients, such as those with neutrophil-predominant inflammation. Successful submission and allowance to proceed of the IND will enable the company to collaborate on the conduct of a clinical trial with intramural clinicians at the NIH Clinical Center, at the company?s discretion. During review, preference will be given to companies or teams with a demonstrated prior ability to successfully bring either a peptide therapeutic or an inhalational therapeutic to, at a minimum, Phase 1 clinical studies in the US."

9392553,"?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are a heterogeneous group of blood disorders characterized by ineffective and dysplastic hematopoiesis. There are few effective treatments for MDS, due in part to our incomplete understanding of the molecular basis of this disease. The recent discovery of high-frequency mutations affecting the RNA splicing machinery in MDS presents a significant opportunity to further our knowledge of MDS biology and inform the development of new therapeutics. However, the molecular consequences of spliceosomal mutations are unknown, hindering efforts to understand how these mutations contribute to dysplastic hematopoiesis and lead to new therapeutic opportunities. To address this gap in knowledge, we propose to determine the mechanistic, functional, and therapeutic consequences of mutations affecting the spliceosomal gene U2AF1, one of the most commonly mutated genes in MDS. Our team consists of a basic scientist with experience in RNA splicing mechanisms and splicing- based therapeutics (Bradley) and a physician-scientist with experience in MDS biology and patient care (Shimamura). In preliminary studies, we determined how MDS-associated mutations alter U2AF1's normal role in 3' splice site recognition and identified molecular abnormalities in U2AF1-mutant cells. We propose to build on these preliminary studies with the following aims: Aim 1, Determine the mechanistic basis and consequences of the observed genetic spectrum of U2AF1 mutations; Aim 2, Determine how U2AF1 mutations dysregulate downstream molecular pathways, contributing to molecular features of dysplastic cells; Aim 3, Identify potential therapeutic opportunities for targeting U2AF1-mutant cells. The significance of these studies is that they will determine the molecular consequences of U2AF1 mutations and give insight into how spliceosomal mutations promote MDS. The health relatedness is that the proposed research may identify opportunities for selectively killing cells with U2AF1 mutations."

Obesity is the number one public health issue facing the US population and is an independent risk for venous thromboembolism (VTE). Therefore, there is a public health need to develop effective contraception for woman that does not increase the risk of VTE. One Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved contraceptive method is the progestin-only pill (POP). This method requires strict adherence to taking the POP at the same time every day. The method is associated with irregular bleeding which often leads to discontinuation of the method. Daily low dose oral progesterone receptor modulators (PRMs), such as UPA, have been shown to inhibit ovulation and cause amenorrhea. The endogenous estrogen level is not affected by the PRM. Thus, the method will provide a regimen that is easier to follow than POP regimen and have a theoretically lower risk of VTE, especially for obese women. In addition, there is in vitro evidence that UPA may have protective activity against breast cancer. In order to provide preliminary evidence that daily, low dose UPA could be effective for contraception, a clinical trial will be conducted in the NICHD Contraceptive Clinical Trials Network (CCTN). The proposed study will be evaluated sequentially. Initially, women of reproductive age, with normal menstrual cycles, will receive treatment for 12 weeks (three 28-day cycles) in order to evaluate the mechanisms of contraceptive efficacy, safety and acceptability of this new contraceptive."

The research must include (1) identification of novel adjuvant candidates through high throughput screening (HTS) approaches and validation that lead compounds stimulate human cells; (2) determination of the mechanism of action of select lead compounds, including the identification of the receptor(s) the adjuvant candidates work through and the cellular signaling pathways they activate; (3) optimization of lead adjuvant candidates through formulation and medicinal chemistry, guided by structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies; and (4) verification of the efficacy of lead compounds as vaccine adjuvants in vivo in an animal model.    Projects must include animal model studies to test the adjuvant candidates with vaccines against:  A) One or more NIAID Emerging and Re-emerging Infectious Disease Pathogens http://www.niaid.nih.gov/topics/emerging/pages/default.aspx), or  B) One or more NIAID Emerging and Re-emerging Infectious Disease Pathogens as well as one or more other (non-HIV) pathogens relevant to human disease."
9573738,"The Epidemiology Branch and Division are currently inviting female partners of participants in the Folic Acid and Zinc Supplementation Trial (FAZST), to participate in a study (the Impact of Diet, Exercise and Lifestyle on Fertility [IDEAL] study) that includes specific and detailed follow-up for the female partners to address these important research questions. The FAZST trial is a multi-site double-blind block-randomized placebo-controlled clinical trial to evaluate the effect of folic acid and zinc sulfate supplementation on semen quality and fertility treatment outcomes among male partners of couples seeking fertility treatment. The proposed initiative is a 16-month data supporting contract for the ?Impact of Diet Exercise And Lifestyle on Fertility: The IDEAL Fertility Study? with the University of Utah under contract HHSN275201500001C. The Data Coordinating Center (DCC) has been responsible for the overall data management and the web-based data collection system throughout the study and has worked in conjunction with the Trial Coordinating Center(TCC) that has been responsible for recruitment and retention of the female partners. The Trial Coordinating Center is a separate scope of work and is a separate non-severable contract. The objective of the proposed task order is to provide data management support for the final 200 women recruited for the study and close-out support for 16 months. As the close-out requires several specific variables to be created and extensive data cleaning, it is necessary to start the process early to ensure timeline completion in line with the FAZST trial."
9579435,"The NCI Office of the Director (OD) proposes a Human Tumor Atlas pilot project in response to the Blue Ribbon Panel (BRP) recommendations issued as part of the Beau Biden Cancer MoonshotSM Initiative. Upon its completion, the Human Tumor Atlas will offer a comprehensive description of the dynamics of the molecular, cellular, and physiological events associated with individual tumor cells, the tumor mass itself, the tissue of origin, and sites of metastases. The Human Tumor Atlas pilot project should provide a foundation on which larger scale atlas efforts may be constructed, including development of standard operating procedures (SOPs) that address challenges associated with acquisition of high quality normal and tumor tissue across research sites, reliable and robust data collection, including quality control metrics, and community-accessible data. Ideally, the Human Tumor Atlas pilot project will inform future data collection by determining which single-cell analysis strategies are maximally informative with respect to describing the heterogeneous states and spatial distribution of tumor and non-tumor cells, including immune cells, stromal components, and complementary cancer-derived biomaterials. The resulting pilot-scale tumor atlas should facilitate predictive modeling of cancer by the scientific community to aid in the understanding of mechanisms underlying pediatric cancer and metastatic breast cancer."

9238947,"A range of behavioral, physiological, and cognitive responses (e.g. approach and avoidance, autonomic reactivity, and subjective feelings) reflects a subject's emotional state. The cognitive regulation of emotion refers to the capacity to regulate these emotional responses in a flexible manner according to a cognitive operation. Deficits in the cognitive regulation of emotional processes characterize many psychiatric disorders. In everyday life, however, particular sensory stimuli and/or actions can elicit different emotional responses depending upon the situation or context. Contexts often rely on a cognitive understanding of one's current situation in the absence of explicit cues. These types of contexts may be referred to as ?abstract? contexts. This grant studies a type of abstract context where the context is determined by a task set. A task set is the set of stimulus- response-outcome mappings (or rules) that dictate correct performance for trials within a particular block. Previous research demonstrates the capacity of primates to learn these abstract contexts, and neural representations of abstract contexts exist in the amygdala and two areas in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), the anterior cingulate and orbitofrontal cortices (ACC and OFC). This grant seeks to understand the mechanisms that underlie the formation and maintenance of these representations of contexts. In contrast to supervised learning driven by error signals, we hypothesize that the occurrence of temporally associated trial types triggers unsupervised learning, presumably through a Hebbian mechanism involving activity-dependent plasticity. This learning could underlie formation of representations of abstract contexts defined by task sets, which will be explored with electrophysiological recordings in Aim 1. The creation of a representation of a task set requires combining information about the current trial with information about the trials that have occurred recently. Brain structures that provide memory traces of recent events and/or that combine information over time could create representations of a task set prior to the emergence of the representations observed in amygdala, OFC, and ACC. Our next experiments therefore target the hippocampus and dorsolateral PFC (DLPFC), which are implicated in memory processes, working memory, and executive functions. We will compare and contrast the encoding of task sets in hippocampus, DLPFC, OFC, and ACC during and after learning about task sets (Aim 2). Finally, we will use causal methods to determine if PFC input to the amygdala and the hippocampus acts to maintain these context representations, which could be a vital mechanism for the cognitive regulation of emotion (Aim 3). Overall, these experiments promise to illuminate neurophysiological mechanisms critical for normal adaptive emotional health. !"
